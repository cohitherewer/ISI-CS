 Epitaph reignites Schiavo squabble

 - Plaque 

 irks parents 

 JACQUI GODDARD 

 Terri Schiavo

 Miami, June 26: Beside a rippling pond surrounded by oaks, cypress and fragrant magnolia, the ashes of Terri Schiavo, the brain-damaged woman who became a symbol of the right-to-life debate, have finally been laid to rest nearly three months after her death.

 Yet the interment in Clearwater, Florida, has merely served to reignite the bitter row over her fate, after her parents accused Michael Schiavo, Terris husband, of using the gravestone to have the last say. 

 Against their wishes, Schiavo fought a lengthy legal battle to have his wifes feeding tube removed, insisting that she had asked him to do so in the event of any incident that left her brain-damaged.

 Now, on the bronze plaque marking her grave, he has inscribed a pointed farewell message which they see as a final V sign. I kept my promise, it reads. 

 The tombstone records March 21, 2005, the day on which Mrs Schiavo, 41, died nearly two weeks after the tube was withdrawn, as when she was at peace.

 Yet it also declares that she actually departed this earth on February 25, 1990, when she suffered the collapse that left her disabled. 

 Her parents, Bob and Mary Schindler, led the campaign to keep their daughter alive, fighting the diagnosis of court-appointed doctors that she was in a persistent vegetative state all the way to the US Supreme Court. 

 They interpret Schiavos choice of words as a cheap shot aimed at them, rather than a loving epitaph to his wife. It had been their hope that Terris grave marker would have celebrated her life rather than memorialising her husbands decision to end her life, said their lawyer, David Gibbs. 

 He added: Thats a decision that will for ever remain a heartbreak to them.

 They were also distraught that their daughters ashes were buried in Florida, not near their home in Pennsylvania. 

 Schiavos brother, Brian Schiavo, denied that spite was the motive behind the epitaph, saying that the Schindlers shouldnt consider themselves that important.

 I know the Schindlers look at it as a slap in the face, he said. They had nothing to do with it. That message was based from Michael to Terri. That was something he was feeling. They had a promise to each other and he stuck by it.

 The Schindlers still dispute his right to take her life. Terri was brain-injured. This does not mean that she was brain-dead, they said in a statement.

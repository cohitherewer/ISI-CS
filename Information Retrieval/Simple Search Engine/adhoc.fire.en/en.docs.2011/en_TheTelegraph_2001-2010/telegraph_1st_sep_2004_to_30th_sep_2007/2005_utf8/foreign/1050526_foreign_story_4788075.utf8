 HK interim leader quits

 Hong Kong, May 25 (Reuters): Hong Kong interim leader Donald Tsang said today that he had resigned in order to run for the citys top political job in a July election.

 Political sources say Tsang has the blessing of Chinese leaders and is sure to win because the citys chief executive is chosen not by Hong Kong citizens but by a Beijing-sanctioned electoral college of 800 people.

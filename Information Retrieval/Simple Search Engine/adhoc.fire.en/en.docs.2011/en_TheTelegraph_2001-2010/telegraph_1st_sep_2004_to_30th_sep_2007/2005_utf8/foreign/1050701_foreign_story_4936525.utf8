 Fine Print

 Alcohol angst

 Brussels, June 30 (Reuters): A lunch meeting between a leading parliamentarian in Belgium and counterparts from Iran has been cancelled because the beer-loving Belgian could not stomach a ban on alcohol.

 Even for the tolerant Herman De Croo, that was a bridge too far, De Croo, a Dutch-speaking Liberal, told De Standaard daily today. 

 De Croo, president of parliaments lower house, had been due to entertain the speaker and members of the Iranian parliament tomorrow during their visit to Belgium.

 But he said lunch had been cancelled because the Iranians, who as Muslims do not drink alcohol, wanted their hosts to do the same.

 Top wine 

 Seoul (Reuters): Reclusive North Korean leader Kim Jong-il was presented with five bottles of top Chilean wine by a South Korean minister during a recent rare meeting, a South Korean newspaper reported. Unification minister Chung Dong-young gave Kim the booze, worth about $1,200 in total.

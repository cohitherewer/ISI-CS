 Mugabe defies EU travel ban

 Harare, April 7 (Reuters): Zimbabwe?s President Robert Mugabe has joined world dignitaries in Rome for tomorrow?s funeral of Pope John Paul, an official said, despite travel restrictions imposed on him by the EU.

 The official said Mugabe, a Roman Catholic, had left for the Vatican last night. He gave no further details.

 The EU imposed travel sanctions on Zimbabwean government officials after accusations of vote rigging in Zimbabwe?s parliamentary polls in 2000 and in Mugabe?s re-election two years later.

 The Vatican is technically a state within a state and not part of the EU, although any visitor must pass through Italian territory. 

 Mugabe said last week his government enjoyed excellent relations with Italy.

 The EU, the US and Britain have dismissed as a charade a general election last month in which Mugabe?s ruling ZANU-PF party won a two-thirds majority in parliament.

 Blast Briefs 

 Explosions follow Giuliani 

 London, July 8: Rudolph Giuliani, the former mayor of New York so closely identified with his citys recovery after September 11 attacks, was in the city yesterday, just yards from Liverpool Street station when the bombs went off.

 Giuliani, who now runs Giuliani Partners, a security consultancy and investment bank, said the events strongly recalled the attacks on the World Trade Center. 

 They are a very eerie reminder of September 11. I was right near Liverpool [Street] station when the first bombing took place, so I could hear the sirens and then kept hearing reports of different bombings...

 Cycle creak

 London (Reuters): Londons streets creaked and rattled with nervous new cyclists today after bicycle sales rocketed in the wake of the bomb blasts. Seasoned cyclists told of weary walkers offering them up to ?300 for their bikes as they headed home on Thursday, and of giving impromptu lessons to shaky beginners. 

 Secret link

 London (Reuters): A secret Internet chatroom run by Britains financial regulators helped keep Londons financial markets open after Thursdays blasts. The Bank of England, the treasury and the financial services authority switched on a secure section of their Financial Sector Continuity website to talk to major banks operating in the financial hub about how they were coping.

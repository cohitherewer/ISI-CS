 US navy surveys strait for damage

 Singapore, Jan. 25 (Reuters): 

 The US navy is surveying the Malacca Strait and coastal 

 waters off Indonesia for signs that last month?s devastating 

 Indian Ocean tsunami altered the sea bed under the world?s 

 busiest shipping lane.

 The USNS John McDonnell, a 208-feet specialist vessel, left Singapore on January 18 and was expected to complete its work by the middle of February in waters off Indonesia?s Aceh province near the epicentre of the earthquake that triggered the tsunami, US navy officials said.

 The mission comes after the respected Marshall Islands Asia-Pacific maritime authorities issued an advisory that said the earthquake and tsunami may have been powerful enough to alter sea depths near southeast Asia?s Malacca Strait.

 Singapore media have published reports saying the tsunami may have reduced water depths in the Aceh sea bed by as much as a thousand metres. But some experts say such a massive change may not be plausible but that the sea bed likely changed.

 ?When tsunamis travel into shallow waters, they may pile up between 10 to 20 metres of sediment but that won?t account for a thousand-metre change,? said David Higgitt, associate professor of geography at the National University of Singapore. 

 As part of its mission, the US naval vessel will examine the ocean floor under the Malacca Strait, said Lieutenant Patrick Starke.

 The narrow strait between Malaysia and Indonesia, with Singapore at its southern entrance, carries more than a quarter of world trade and almost all oil imports to Japan and China.

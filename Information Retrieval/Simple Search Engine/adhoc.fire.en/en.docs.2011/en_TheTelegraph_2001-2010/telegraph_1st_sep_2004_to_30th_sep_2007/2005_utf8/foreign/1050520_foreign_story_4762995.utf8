 Breakthrough on stem cell

 Woo Suk Hwang

 Washington, May 19 (Reuters): South Korean scientists, who cloned the first human embryo to use for research, said today they have used the same technology to create batches of embryonic stem cells from nine patients.

 Their study fulfils one of the basic promises of using cloning technology in stem cell research ? that a piece of skin could be taken from a patient and used to grow the stem cells.

 Researchers believe the cells could one day be trained to provide tailored tissue and organ transplants to cure juvenile diabetes, Parkinsons disease and even to repair severed spinal cords. Unlike so-called adult stem cells, embryonic stem cells have the potential from the beginning to form any cell or tissue in the body.

 Woo Suk Hwang and colleagues at Seoul National University report their process is much more efficient than they hoped, and yielded 11 stem cell batches, called lines, from six adults and three children with spinal cord injuries, juvenile diabetes and a rare immune disorder.

 This study shows that embryonic stem cells can be derived using nuclear transfer from patients with illness ... regardless of sex or age, Hwang said.

 I am amazed at how much they have accomplished in just a year and the amount, the quality and the rigorousness of their evidence, Dr Gerald Schatten of the University of Pittsburgh, a stem cell expert who reviewed the study, said .

 While the patients whose cells were copied do benefit at this juncture, the researchers hope to study the cells to understand their conditions better.

 The report, published in the journal Science, is certain to add to the growing US political controversy over the federal funding of embryonic stem cell research. Opponents say all such work is unethical and should be banned.

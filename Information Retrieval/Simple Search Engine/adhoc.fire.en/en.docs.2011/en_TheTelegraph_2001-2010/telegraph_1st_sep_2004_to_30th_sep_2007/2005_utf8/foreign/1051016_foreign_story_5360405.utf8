 US pedals to beat petrol price

 K.P. NAYAR

 Washington, Oct. 15: America may be remaking itself in Chinas image even as China is increasingly looking like America: at least the urban streets of both countries, going by the latest figures for the automobile industry and organisations of bicycle producers.

 Soaring petrol prices in Americas pumps have pushed up sales of bicycles, with 19 million bikes being snapped up across the US in the last 12 months.

 That figure nearly matches this countrys record in bicycle sales of 20 million bikes a year, soon after the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) administered their first oil shock on the world in 1973.

 Pump prices for fuel across the US have approximately doubled to around $ 3 a gallon of regular petrol in the last one year. 

 Figures for September showed a fall of 50 per cent in sales of big sports utility vehicles (SUVs), GMC Envoy and Chevrolet Tahoe, compared to the same month last year.

 General Motors reported an overall decline in September sales of 24 per cent with SUV and truck sales down by 30 per cent and car sales dropping 14 per cent.

 Ford Motor Co. similarly reported an overall drop in sales of 20 per cent in September with the demand for trucks and SUVs falling 28 per cent.

 Curiously the rise in US bicycle sales of 10 per cent in the nine months of 2005 has been almost evenly matched by a decline in automobile sales of 9.5 per cent overall in the same period.

 The irony is that a bleak year for the US automobile sector, crucial for the economy, may have been partly aided by Americas President George W. Bush.

 Under fire for not doing enough to bring down petrol prices, he urged American motorists a few days ago to share cars and drive less.

 During his month-long vacation in August, Bush rode around his Texas ranch on a bike with Lance Armstrong, who has become an icon for Americans after winning his seventh successive Tour de France in July.

 The highly publicised ride gave a push to Americas growing affair with bicycles, especially the speciality ones used on mountain roads. 

 One company making speciality bikes has seen its sales revenue rise ten-fold in 15 years. In August, the US Congress budgeted about $1.3 billion to create cycle paths in the next four years. 

 Egged on by Bush and popular discontent, US energy secretary Samuel Bodman this week outlined a national oil conservation campaign after doing little about the issue during the nearly five years of this Republican rule.

 Urban China, where armies of bicycles were once the main mode of transport, streets are being clogged by gleaming, new automobiles.

 Los Angeles, Aug. 23 (Reuters): Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston, once anointed Hollywoods golden couple, have filed to formally end their four-year marriage, court papers showed yesterday.

 Pitt and Aniston, who were married on July 29, 2000 in a celebrity-studded, $1 million ceremony in Malibu, ended their divorce proceedings on Friday by quietly filing dissolution papers with a Los Angeles court.

 Judgment of dissolution is entered, the papers state. Marital or domestic partnership status is terminated and the parties are restored to the status of single persons.

 The papers list October 2, 2005, as the date that the divorce becomes final and note that Aniston and Pitt have reached an out-of-court agreement.

 The documents were signed by Pitt, 41, and Aniston, 36, along with their respective attorneys and a retired Los Angeles judge who handled the matter.

 Aniston, best known for starring on the hit TV comedy Friends, filed for divorce earlier this year. The court papers formally restore her maiden name.

 Pitt, who starred alongside Angelina Jolie in recent action film Mr. and Mrs. Smith, has been romantically linked to Jolie in news reports since Aniston filed for divorce.

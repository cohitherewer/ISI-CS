 Kylie spirits high after surgery

 Kylie Minogue: Spinning around

 Melbourne, May 21 (Reuters): Australian pop diva Kylie Minogue has undergone successful surgery for early breast cancer at a Melbourne hospital and her spirits are high, her surgeon said today.

 I am very pleased to be able to confirm that the operation was successful, said Jenny Senior, who operated on Minogue yesterday afternoon. I feel confident that we caught the cancer in time and she is now on the road to a complete recovery.

 Her spirits are high and shes feeling fine, she added.

 Minogue, 36, said on Tuesday she had been diagnosed with early breast cancer and postponed her Australian and Asian Showgirl Tour concerts. Her management said on Thursday initial tests had shown the cancer was confined to the breast.

 Senior did not give any details about the operation but said the surgery was considered best practice around the world for early breast cancer. She said Minogue was resting but wanted to thank her many well-wishers.

 Kylie has asked me to pass on her thanks once again to all who have expressed their love and concern for her, Senior said. Your support has certainly helped her through a tough time.

 She declined to say where Minogue was recuperating.

 Her younger sister Dannii, also a pop singer, flew from London to join family and friends by her side. Minogue, signed to EMI, is worth about A$60 million (US$46 million), according to a 2004 list of rich, young Australians compiled by BRW magazine.

 Minogue rose from humble showbiz beginnings as a teenage actress in the Australian soap opera, Neighbours, in the 1980s to international stardom as one of the worlds top pop singers. 

 News of Minogues breast cancer has dominated Australian and British media and has attracted words of sympathy and support from some of the music industrys biggest names ? from Britains Elton John to US pop singer Madonna.

 On the streets of Sydney, fans were delighted at news of the successful operation.

 Thats some good news for her, for us and everybody in Australia. Thank God, you know what I mean, said Mostafa Khattabi, a shop owner at Sydneys Circular Quay ferry terminal.

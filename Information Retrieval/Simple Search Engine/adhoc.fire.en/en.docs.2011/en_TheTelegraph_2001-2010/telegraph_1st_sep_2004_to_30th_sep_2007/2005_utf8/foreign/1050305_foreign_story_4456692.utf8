 ?Hobbit? claimed to be new human species

 NIC FLEMING

 London, March 4: The fossilised remains of a cavewoman discovered on a remote Indonesian island are those of a new human species rather than just a pygmy with a brain-shrinking condition, according to tests.

 Scientists compared models of the brain of the 3 foot female, nicknamed the hobbit, with other brains and their findings bolster the theory that she is the first of the new species Homo floresiensis.

 The discovery of her 18,000-year-old remains alongside other finds provided a fascinating glimpse of a lost world inhabited by little people who crafted stone tools, roasted elephant, built rafts and probably used language. 

 It raised the possibility that some members of the previously undiscovered species could have lived until relatively recently in the remote rainforests of southeast Asia.

 The latest research undermines the arguments of critics who claimed that the remains could have been those of a pygmy who had suffered from microcephaly, a condition that limits brain growth because of chromosomal abnormalities.

 Dean Falk, the chair of anthropology at Florida State University and lead author of a paper published online in Science yesterday, said: ?Our results suggest it is indeed a new species in the genus Homo.

 ?Overall she most resembles Homo erectus but is in some ways more primitive and with some special features. Our findings are consistent with higher cognition.

 ?She has a close relative in the Homo erectus but it may not necessarily be a direct descendant. It may be the two have a common ancestor. It is shaped nothing like a microcephalic and the brain size to body size is nothing like a human pygmy.?

 The remains of the tiny cavewoman were found in 2003 during a dig in Liang Bua, a large limestone cave on the island of Flores, 370 miles east of Bali, by a team led by Radien Soejono, from the Indonesian Research Centre for Archaeology and Mike Morwood, of the University of New England, New South Wales.

 Analysis suggested the skeleton was of a fully-grown female aged around 30. Found alongside sophisticated stone tools and evidence of fire, she had a brain approximately a third of the size of modern human adults. She was nicknamed the hobbit after the characters in Tolkein?s The Lord of the Rings.

 The discoveries provide further backing to the ?Out of Africa? theory of evolution which suggests modern humans evolved in Africa first then spread over the rest of the old world, displacing other populations and driving them to extinction.

 Many see the findings as undermining the ?multi-regional continuity? hypothesis which states there was evolutionary continuity from earlier to later human populations in all areas of the old world.

 Using a cast of the interior of the cavewoman?s brain, CT scan data and models, Prof. Falk and colleagues produced a digital representation of her brain casing.

 A complex model of the shape, capacity and cerebral composition of the original brain was built up and compared with the brains of chimpanzees, humans ? including a microcephalic and a pygmy ? and Homo erectus, a hominid that lived in Asia and Africa from about two million to 25,000 years ago.

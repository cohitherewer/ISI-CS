 Tung quits, cites ill health

 Hong Kong, March 10 (Reuters): Embattled Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa, whose unpopular leadership sparked massive pro-democracy protests, confirmed today that he has submitted his resignation for health reasons.

 ?An hour ago I tendered my resignation as chief executive ... my health is not as good as it used to be,? Tung told a news conference, putting an end to his long silence over news reports of his impending departure.

 Tung, Hong Kong?s first post-colonial leader after the end of British rule in 1997, said if Beijing accepted his resignation chief secretary Donald Tsang would take over as acting chief executive until elections were held in six months.

 Tung said he had to take painkillers to help him stand through a policy speech in January and added that his biggest regret was being unable to serve till his term ends in mid-2007.

 Questions over who will replace Tung and any subsequent shakeup in the cabinet unsettled the market last week, but traders said any negative impact would be short-lived.

 But many people still believe Tung was fired by Chinese leaders in a violation of their promise to give the city a high degree of autonomy after the sovereignty handover.

 Tung denied that.?That is not the case at all,? he said, emphasising his health was the only reason he was quitting.

 Tung?s fate was apparently sealed in December when Chinese President Hu Jintao scolded him in public for poor performance in an unprecedented rebuke, analysts said.

 ?I think it is a result of discussions between Tung and the central government. His health may be an important issue but I think this is not the only issue,? said Timothy Wong, political analyst at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

 EU rift widens over budget contribution

 Paris/London, June 10 (Reuters): France and Germany mounted a fierce campaign by EU leaders today to persuade Britain to accept a reduction of its annual EU budget rebate to help reach a deal on the blocs long-term finances.

 British Prime Minister Tony Blair, looking isolated, opened the way to a compromise by suggesting a deal would be possible if EU leaders agreed to a major overhaul of the budget.

 But tension rose after his finance minister said London could veto any move to cut the multi-billion euro payback and President Jacques Chirac ruled out any compromise over the big farm subsidies that France receives from Brussels.

 A showdown is looming at an EU summit next week. Failure to agree to the 2007-2013 funding programme would ruin efforts to show the 25-nation bloc is back on track after French and Dutch voters rejection of the unions planned constitution.

 I think therell be a deal in the next week... There is political pressure. It is easier to get a deal when there is pressure, European monetary affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in London.

 Britains rebate was won in 1984 when it was one of the poorest EU countries and got little back from Brussels in farm subsidies, which at that time made up 75 per cent of the EU budget.

 Iraq issues warrants for 2 British soldiers

 Basra, Sept. 24 (Reuters): An Iraqi judge has issued arrest warrants for two British soldiers freed after a British raid in Basra, an Iraqi lawyer said today, and thousands rallied in the southern city in support of a new constitution.

 Judge Raghib Hassan issued the warrants on Thursday, accusing the men of killing an Iraqi policeman and wounding another, carrying unlicensed weapons and holding false identification, Kassim al-Sabti, the head of the lawyers syndicate in Basra said.

 Britains ministry of defence said today it had not received any arrest warrants for the soldiers in Basra, adding that in any case the warrants would have no legal basis. All British troops in Iraq come under the jurisdiction of Britain, a defence spokesman said in London.

 The whereabouts of the two soldiers was not clear. British forces mounted a bid to free the two soldiers on Monday, but were initially repelled as a crowd of angry Iraqis petrol-bombed an armoured vehicle.

 Later, British forces returned and armoured vehicles broke down the walls of the jail. The two were later freed from a private house nearby, where they were believed to have been held by a local militia. Basra authorities said British troops killed two Iraqi police during the raid.

 Mondays flare-up has harmed the relationship British forces were able to build with local Iraqis in and around Basra, a relatively stable city compared with other parts of Iraq.

 Basras governing council has suspended all cooperation with the British until they apologise, guarantee that similar actions do not recur and provide compensation for damage inflicted.

 Two investigations into the events leading up to the rescue are under way by Iraqi authorities and the British military.

 Iraqi police said US troops killed a family of four in Karbala, south of Baghdad, today, reflecting military nerves on edge across the country.

 Police said the familys passenger car apparently got too close to a US convoy, which opened fire, killing a father and mother and their 13-year-old son and nine-year-old daughter.

 Basra is the largest city in majority-Shia southern Iraq, and thousands of citizens rallied today in support of a proposed new Iraqi constitution which many Shias hope will boost their status in the fragmented country.

 The rally followed calls last week by Iraqs most senior Shia cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, to vote in favour of the charter, which will be put to a referendum on October 15.

 Shias were suppressed under Saddam Hussein, who banned major religious ceremonies at the holy cities of Najaf and Karbala and crushed a Shia revolt in 1991. Such ceremonies have drawn crowds of a million or more since he was ousted.

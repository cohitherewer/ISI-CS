 Bush in aid appeal with Clinton, father

 Washington, Jan. 3 (Reuters): President George W. Bush brought together former Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton today to launch an appeal for Americans to make a donation to help victims of the South Asia quake and tsunamis.

 ?I ask every American to contribute as they are able to do so,? Bush said.

 The President?s father and Clinton will lead a bipartisan effort to seek out donations both large and small to provide relief assistance to millions left homeless by the December 26 calamity that killed thousands in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand.

 ?We are here to ask our fellow citizens to join in a broad humanitarian relief effort,? said Bush, joined in the White House Roosevelt Room by his two immediate predecessors.

 The US President, whose initial reaction to the catastrophe was criticised as sluggish, called the $350 million pledged by the US government ?an initial commitment.? Lawmakers on Capitol Hill are contemplating more.

 Bush asked Americans to contribute directly to reliable charities already providing help to tsunami victims. He cited as examples the Red Cross and the Red Crescent, the Salvation Army, Catholic Relief Services, Save the Children, CARE, Unicef and America Cares. He directed people to the USA Freedom Corps website at www.usafreedomcorps.gov for more information.

 ?As men and women across the devastated region begin to rebuild, we offer our sustained compassion and our generosity and our assurance that America will be there to help,? Bush said. The scale of the disaster prompted the White House to put together the rare coalition of ex-Presidents to mount a nationwide fund-raising drive. The disaster caused by the Indian Ocean tsunami offered Bush a fresh challenge as he gears up for a second term.

 Many Americans have already been making private donations, and Bush said novel means have been used, citing the example of a coffee roaster in California handing out bags of coffee for a $10 donation to the Red Cross. Bush, his wife, Laura, and the two ex-Presidents later visited the embassies of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand to sign condolence books and express their sympathies.

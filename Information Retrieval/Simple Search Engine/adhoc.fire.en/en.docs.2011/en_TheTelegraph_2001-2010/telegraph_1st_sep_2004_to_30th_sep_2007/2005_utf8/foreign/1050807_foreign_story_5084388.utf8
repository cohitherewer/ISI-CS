 14 killed in plane crash off Italy coast

 Palermo (Sicily), Aug. 6 (Reuters): At least 14 people were killed and 20 injured when their Tunisair flight from Italy to Tunisia made an emergency landing in the sea off Sicily today after reporting a technical fault, emergency services said.

 The pilot of the plane, which had 39 people on board, made a distress call to Palermo airport at 1324 GMT, requesting to make an emergency landing, an Italian civil aviation official said.

 The plane landed about 19 km out at sea at 3:40 and shortly afterwards survivors were seen on the wings of the floating plane. A Tunisian government official said by telephone that 24 of 35 passengers, all Italians, survived the crash.

 ANSA newswire said the death toll was at least nine.

 Survivors brought to shore at Palermo were seen being helped out of rescue launches, many with bloody faces and ripped clothes, some yelling in pain. The port was milling with ambulances while helicopters buzzed overhead.

 The twin-turboprop ATR 72 had taken off from Bari in southern Italy, heading for Djerba, Tunisia, police said. ATRs are made by Avions de Transport Regional, based in France, and can carry up to 72 passengers. Earlier, emergency services had identified the plane as the smaller ATR 42 model.

 In Toronto on Tuesday, an Air France Airbus tore off the end of a runway and plunged into a ravine before bursting into flames. All passengers survived

 Bangla coup illegal

 Dhaka, Aug. 29 (PTI): A Bangladesh high court today declared illegal and void the 1975 military takeover that killed the countrys first President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

 Judges A.B.M. Khairul Huq and A.T.M Fazle Kabir made the observations in a dispute over an abandoned property in a writ challenging the validity of a martial regulation.

 The rule was incorporated in the countrys fifth constitutional amendment ratifying all martial law actions taken between august 15, 1975 and 1979.

 Taking over the powers of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh with effect from the morning of 15th August, 1975, by Khondoker Moshtaque Ahmed, the usurper, placing Bangladesh under martial law and his assumption of the office of the President of Bangladesh by proclamation of 20-8-75 were in clear violation of the constitution and as such illegal without lawful authority, and without jurisdiction, the judges said. 

 Consequently, all his subsequent actions as the President of Bangladesh were illegitimate and void, they added. 

 The judges also referred to taking over of the presidency by Major General Ziaur Rahman, who later founded the now ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), on April 21, 1977. 

 They observed it was also beyond the ambit of the constitution and as such illegal.

 Zias widow Begum Khaleda Zia now heads the BNP and the party-led coalition government in Bangladesh. Zia was assassinated in a coup in May 1981.

 In policy shift, US bans torture

 Kiev, Dec. 7 (Reuters): The US, seeking to defuse European criticism over reports of abuse of prisoners, said today it had changed its policy on interrogating detainees.

 US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, on a trip to Ukraine, said US personnel would be banned worldwide from subjecting prisoners to cruelty. But Amnesty International immediately played down the significance of Rices remark saying: It is not a major concession. 

 It said it still wanted serious action by Washington over cases of torture in US bases.

 US officials said Rices comments marked a policy shift towards the international convention on torture. Previously, the Bush administration had interpreted the convention as only applying to US territory.

 Rice is on a tour of Europe to defuse widespread criticism by rights bodies over treatment of prisoners at US bases. These critics suspect the CIA of running secret prisons in eastern Europe and covertly transporting suspects around the continent.

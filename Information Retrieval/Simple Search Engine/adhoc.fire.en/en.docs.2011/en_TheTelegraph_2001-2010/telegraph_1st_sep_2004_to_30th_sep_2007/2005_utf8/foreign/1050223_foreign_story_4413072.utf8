 Banderas to sing at Oscars

 Los Angeles, Feb. 22 (AFP): John Travolta will hand out a coveted Oscar at Sunday?s Academy Awards, while Antonio Banderas and singer Santana will perform a nominated song at the ceremony, producers said.

 The trio mark the latest addition to the all-star line-ups of Oscar presenters and performers who will appear on stage at Hollywood?s Kodak Theatre on February 27. Travolta has twice been nominated for the best actor Oscar ? for 1977?s Saturday Night Fever and 1994?s Pulp Fiction.

 He will next appear on screens in Be Cool, the comedic, gangster-driven sequel to his earlier hit Get Shorty.

 Spanish star Banderas will join Mexican-born Carlos Santana in singing the Oscar-nominated nominated song Al Otro Lado del Rio from The Motorcycle Diaries, the story of Argentine-born revolutionary Che Guevara.

 Also presenting the Oscars this year are such celebrities as Australia?s Cate Blanchett, South African Oscar-winner Charlize Theron, Renee Zellweger, Natalie Portman, Kate Winslet and Aviator director Martin Scorsese.

 The Aviator goes into the awards armed with a leading 11 nominations including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor for Leonardo DiCaprio. The $110-million film tells the story of eccentric US billionaire, flyer and moviemaker Howard Hughes.

 But pundits are now predicting that Clint Eastwood?s Million Dollar Baby, about a determined female boxer (Hilary Swank), is now favourite to win the Best Picture, Best Actress and Best Director.

 Putin tour

 Cairo, April 26 (Reuters): Russian President Vladimir Putin began a West Asia tour in Egypt today, the first Russian or Soviet leader to visit the former Soviet ally for 40 years.

 Egypt had close relations with the Soviet Union in the 1960s under late President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who welcomed Russian economic and military aid to develop the country and strengthen his armed forces in a long conflict with neighbouring Israel. Abdel Nasser?s successor, President Anwar Sadat, threw out Soviet military advisers in 1972 and moved the country towards close cooperation with the US, arguing that only Washington could end the Arab-Israeli conflict.

 Egypt is Putin?s first stop on a tour which also includes Israel and the Palestinian territories. He will have dinner with President Hosni Mubarak and start formal talks tomorrow. 

 The Egyptian ambassador to Moscow, Raouf Saad, said Mubarak and Putin would talk about Iraq, West Asian peace and the conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan. After years of stagnation, commercial relations between Egypt and Russia have started to revive. Some 700,000 Russian tourists came to Egypt last year and Egypt buys considerable amounts of Russian wheat. 

 Russia is also a member, along with the US, the UN and the EU, of the quartet which oversees attempts to make peace in West Asia. But Russia has played a minor role in the process. The highlights of Putin?s tour will be in Israel and the Palestinian territories. He will be the first Russian leader ever to visit the Jewish state.

 Cocaine, sex strain on Kate

 RICHARD ALLEYNE

 London, Sept. 19: Kate Mosss modelling career was put in further jeopardy yesterday after more revelations emerged about her private life, including further allegations of drug-taking and sleazy sexual behaviour.

 The new claims came as the fashion world gathered for the opening of London Fashion Week, and included reports that the model and mother of a three-year-old child enjoyed lesbian orgies and took cocaine while attending a function with Nelson Mandela. The allegations are likely to place extra strain on her relationship with the fashion and cosmetic firms that employ her to front their products. 

 Much of Mosss success and longevity as a model since she was discovered 17 years ago have been attributed to her aloofness and control over her image. She never speaks to the press about her private life and is rarely seen looking anything but her fashionable best.

 But since a national newspaper secretly photographed the model allegedly snorting cocaine at a west London recording studio last week with Pete Doherty, her drug-addict boyfriend, further allegations about her private life have emerged. Yesterday the News of the World reported that the face of Chanel, Christian Dior and Burberry had instigated sex with her girlfriends after taking cocaine. It claimed that while sober she would never be attracted to women, but the use of the drug removed all her inhibitions.

 The report also claimed that her use of cocaine had moved on from recreational to serious addiction. It is alleged that Moss, 31, was high on the class A drug while attending a charity dinner in Barcelona.

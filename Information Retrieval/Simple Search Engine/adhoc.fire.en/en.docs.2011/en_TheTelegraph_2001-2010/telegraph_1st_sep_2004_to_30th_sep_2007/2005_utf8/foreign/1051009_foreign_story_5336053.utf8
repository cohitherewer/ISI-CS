 Drug bust turns Boy 

cry baby

 New York, Oct. 8 (Reuters): Singer Boy George was arraigned early this morning in Manhattan on drug possession charges after police arrested him when they found a small amount of cocaine at his apartment in Little Italy.

 He was released on his own recognisance and ordered to return to Manhattan criminal court on December 19.

 The singer, whose real name is George Dowd and who made his name with the 1980s pop band Culture Club, then walked out of the courtroom, sat on a bench and began crying like a baby.

 In the court, which convened shortly after midnight, he appeared dazed and did not say anything.

 Boy George (in picture above) called police early on Friday to report a burglary. But when the police arrived a little after 3 am, the officers found the door open and were greeted by the singer who asked them, Whats up?

 A police spokesman said Boy George then staggered about his apartment apparently in a drugged stupor and the police found a small amount of cocaine next to his computer.

 The singer was arrested and held at a New York police station before being transferred to Manhattan criminal court for arraignment on drug possession charges as well as for falsely reporting a burglary.

 It was unclear what prison term, if any, he faces since the police said they had yet to determine with precision what quantity of drugs may have been in his apartment.

 In recent years, George made a new career as a disc jockey and record producer.

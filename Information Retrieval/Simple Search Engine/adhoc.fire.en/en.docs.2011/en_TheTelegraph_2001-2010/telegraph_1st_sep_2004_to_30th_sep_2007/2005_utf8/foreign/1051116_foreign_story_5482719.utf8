 Rice brokers Gaza border deal

 Jerusalem, Nov. 15 (Reuters): US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice brokered a deal on Gaza border crossings in marathon talks with Israel and the Palestinians today, scoring a rare breakthrough in West Asia diplomacy.

 Rice, who put her own reputation at stake by investing so personally in the negotiations, had postponed her departure to Asia for an Apec meeting, staying in Jerusalem an extra day until she secured an agreement on opening the Gaza-Egypt border.

 Access to Gaza is key to strengthening the impoverished strips economy and giving a boost to chances for peace-making following Israels withdrawal from territory in September after 38 years of occupation.

 Bleary-eyed after an almost sleepless night of hard-nosed bargaining, Rice ? on her fourth visit to the region this year ? praised the deal as a good step forward. It hands the Palestinians control of a border for the first time.

 This agreement is intended to give the Palestinian people the freedom to move, to trade, to live ordinary lives, she said in Jerusalem before flying out.

 Rice said the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, the strips gateway to the outside world, should open on November 25 with the presence of EU security monitors.

 Palestinians would also be able to start travelling in bus and truck convoys between Gaza and the occupied West Bank within months, and construction of a Gaza seaport would begin.

 Israel had conditioned the opening of Rafah on its ability to monitor goods and people passing through, saying it feared arms smuggling across the border to Palestinian militants. 

 Palestinians had insisted that Israelis not be at Rafah.

 An Israeli defence ministry source said a compromise was reached whereby Israeli and Palestinian security officers will man a control room a few kilometres from Rafah monitoring remote-control cameras at the border crossing.

 Israel, which has kept control of Gazas borders, air space and sea lanes since its withdrawal, has been under US pressure to re-open the Rafah crossing, mostly closed since September. 

 US officials had voiced frustration with what they viewed as the failure of both sides to capitalise on the Gaza withdrawal, the first removal of settlements by Israel from land Palestinians want for a state.

 In a sign of tensions, President Mahmoud Abbas, in a speech after the Gaza deal was unveiled, accused Israel of trying to avoid peace talks and incite Palestinian civil war by insisting that militants be disarmed before any negotiations on statehood.

 During her visit, Rice renewed US pressure on Abbas to act against armed groups. She also pressed Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, who has vowed that Israel will keep large West Bank settlement blocs forever, to freeze settlement expansion.

 Both sides had previously agreed to EU observers at Rafah, and differences centred on Israeli monitoring of the crossing. 

 Israel wanted to monitor movements via a direct, real-time video feed. Palestinians had objected to that as an impingement on their sovereignty but compromised on a joint monitoring operation.

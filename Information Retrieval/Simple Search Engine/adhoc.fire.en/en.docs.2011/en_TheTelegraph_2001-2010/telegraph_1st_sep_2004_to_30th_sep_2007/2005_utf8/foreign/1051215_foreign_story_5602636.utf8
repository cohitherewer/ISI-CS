 Bid to map cancer genome

 ANDREW POLLACK 

 New York, Dec. 14: The 

 US government is beginning a project designed to unlock 

 the genetic abnormalities that contribute to cancer, an 

 effort that would exceed the Human Genome Project in complexity 

 and could eventually lead to new diagnostic tests and treatments 

 for the disease. 

 Government officials said they 

 would spend $100 million over three years on a pilot phase 

 of the project, which will be called The Cancer Genome Atlas. 

 This is a revolutionary project, Anna D. Barker, 

 deputy director of the National Cancer Institute, said at 

 a news briefing in Washington. Its going to 

 empower all cancer researchers with an entire new set of 

 data to work with. 

 The cancer institute will contribute half of the money with 

 the other half provided by the National Human Genome Research 

 Institute. Both are part of the National Institutes of Health 

 (NIH). 

 Scientists have long known that 

 genetic mutations that accumulate in normal cells over a 

 persons lifetime can make those cells cancerous. 

 About 300 genes involved in cancer 

 are already known, and there are a handful of drugs that 

 work by interfering with specific genetic abnormalities. 

 The drug Gleevec, which blocks 

 a particular genetic change that causes a type of leukaemia 

 , produces remissions in most patients with that form of 

 the disease. Some studies have shown that the lung cancer 

 drug Iressa is likely to work very well for the 10 per cent 

 of patients who have a particular type of mutation but barely 

 at all for others. 

 But federal officials and many cancer researchers say that 

 a more systematic search could find many more genes and 

 gene variations that play an important role in determining 

 how aggressive a cancer will be and what drugs might work 

 best. The first fruits, such as new diagnostic tests, may 

 be seen in several years. 

 We are still working with an incomplete compass, 

 said Francis S. Collins, director of the National Human 

 Genome Research Institute. The time is right to bring 

 the full power of genomics to bear on the problem of cancer. 

 The project would involve determining 

 the sequence of letters in the DNA of tumour cells obtained 

 from biopsies or surgery. The initials of the projects 

 name, TCGA, represent the four letters of the genetic code. 

 Scientists will also look for 

 other changes like duplications or deletions of genes, or 

 differences between cells in which genes are turned on or 

 off. 

 In February a committee advising 

 the cancer institute proposed such a project, which it estimated, 

 would cost $1.35 billion over nine years. 

 But government officials said 

 they would first assess the results of the three-year pilot 

 project before deciding whether a full programme would be 

 worthwhile. They said it was too early to estimate how much 

 a full project would cost. 

 The pilot phase will involve studying 

 hundreds of tumour samples from two or three types of cancer, 

 which have not been chosen yet. The decision will depend 

 upon factors like the availability of tumour samples. A 

 full project could involve studying 50 types of cancer. 

 Some scientists have expressed 

 concern about the project, saying it may divert grant money 

 from individual investigators at a time when the NIH budget 

 is not growing rapidly, as it was a few years ago. 

 Some have also said that cancer 

 cells are so genetically heterogeneous two cells 

 in the same tumour can differ in their mutations 

 that it will be hard to find mutations that are meaningful 

 and could lead to new drugs. We need to be able to 

 look cancer patients and their families in the eye and say, 

 We are spending our money in the best way we know 

 to find a cure for you, Stephen J. Elledge of 

 Harvard and Gregory J. Hannon of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory 

 wrote in Science in October. 

 To minimise the risk of failure, 

 the pilot project will choose types of cancer that have 

 relatively little variability.

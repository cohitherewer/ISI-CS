 Survivors horror tales

 PETER BALE

 London, July 7: A series 

 of co-ordinated blasts across London that appear to be terror 

 related have caused dozens of casualties, shut down the 

 transport system and caused widespread panic.

 These are some of the stories 

 from passengers who were travelling at the time of the blast 

 at 9 am.

 Joanna Myerson, 29, covered 

 in black soot and shaking with shock, was travelling from 

 West Hampstead on a Circle Line train at 8.56 Farringdon 

 to Aldgate. 

 All of a sudden everything 

 went white and we got thrown to the floor and there was 

 smoke and fire outside. It sounded like an impact almost.

 You could see a sort of 

 electrical fire outside the carriage, on the wall of the 

 tunnel.

 Everybody had to walk through 

 the train and then jump down onto the track. In the carriage 

 I was in everyone was crying but they quickly took control. 

 No one panicked. We wedged open the doors, you couldnt 

 open the doors. There were no hammers and you couldnt 

 get any air.

 The front three carriages 

 were where people were injured. People were really good, 

 some people just took control, no one panicked, not in the 

 carriages where we were.

 I am really worried about 

 one guy I saw who was walking with a hole in the back of 

 his head.

 Mustafa Kurtuldu, 24, 

 from Hackney, said: The train seemed to almost lift 

 up off the rails. It sounded like an impact. It went white 

 and there were flames outside the train, but they died down 

 quickly. I was in the next carriage from where the actual 

 thing happened.

 The train almost like lifted 

 up. After about like 10 minutes some guys came, I think 

 they must have been London Underground guys, and they were 

 walking along the track.

 The explosion happened at 

 about five to nine and by the time we got out it was about 

 half past nine. The two witnesses said that they had 

 broken out of the train, forced the doors open and walked 

 along the darkened track with other passengers past by what 

 they believe were three badly damaged front carriages, one 

 of which had been bent out of shape and blown out. 

 They said that there were many 

 injured in front carriages which appeared to take the bulk 

 of the impact of the explosion. I walked past one 

 person lying on the tracks. I dont know if they were 

 all right, said Kurtuldu. 

 Aldgate passenger Sarah Reid 

 said: I was on the train and there was a sudden jolt 

 forward. There was a really hard banging from the carriage 

 next door to us after the explosion ? thats where 

 it happened.

 Describing events moments before 

 the explosion, she said: There was a fire beside me. 

 I saw flames outside on the window of my carriage. 

 She said tearfully that as she was led away down the tracks: 

 I saw bodies. I think some people may have died.

 Doug Streeter, 50 from 

 Primrose Hill, who was standing in Euston Road when the 

 bomb in Tavistock Square went off in a bus. Im 

 standing there and there was the bam. The noise 

 was staggering.

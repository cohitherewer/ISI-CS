 King Tut theory

 Cairo, March 8 (Reuters): A three-dimensional X-ray scan of Tutankhamun?s mummy found no evidence to support theories he was murdered but failed to solve the 3,000-year-old mystery of how the young Egyptian pharaoh died.

 Some members of the investigative team say he may have died from an infected thigh wound, but others doubt this, saying that injury may have been inflicted later by archaeologists, according to the team?s five-page report released today.

 Either way, the team?s chairman says the case should now be closed and the tomb of the king, who is affectionately called King Tut, should not be disturbed again. Some historians have speculated the ruler was murdered, based on his young age and the turbulent political and religious circumstances during that period of Egyptian history.

 ?The case is closed. We should not disturb the king any more,? said Zahi Hawas, chairman of Egypt?s Supreme Council of Antiquities.

 Rome ruse

 Rome (Reuters): A man given six months 

 to live by his doctors has been told by an Italian court 

 to come back in 14 months to hear the outcome of his demand 

 for insurance damages. Carmelo Cisabella, 39, has an inoperable 

 spine disease and is anxious to pick up some 450,000 euros 

 ($596,300) in already-agreed damages from his insurers to 

 help ease his final months of life, Il Messaggero 

 newspaper reported on Tuesday. In a bid to speed up the 

 process, Cisabella turned to the Sicilian courts to put 

 pressure on the slow-moving insurers, but was told to return 

 next year to hear their decision. Il Messaggero said 

 Cisabellas woes dated back more than a decade when 

 he was left paralysed by a motorcycle accident. 

 Pet police

 Berlin (Reuters): A German man who went on holiday left his stereo and lights on so that his pet hamster would not feel lonely in the empty apartment, police said after breaking into it over fears the man may have died. The spokesman for police in Bremen said police broke open the door after being alerted by neighbours that loud music was playing non-stop for five days and the lights were left on. No one answered the door when they knocked. ?There was a fear the occupant might have been disabled or dead,? police said. ?All we found was a pet hamster. The occupant was away on holiday.?

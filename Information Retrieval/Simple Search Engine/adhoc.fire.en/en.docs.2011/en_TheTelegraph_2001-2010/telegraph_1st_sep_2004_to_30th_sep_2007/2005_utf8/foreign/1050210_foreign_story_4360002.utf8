 Ailing Pope misses key service

 Vatican City, Feb. 9 (Reuters): A sick Pope John Paul failed for the first time in 26 years to preside at Ash Wednesday but joined world Catholics from his hospital room in a ritual where dust is rubbed on their foreheads to remind them of mortality.

 The Vatican said the Pope, 84, had received the ashes during a Mass he said in his room in Rome?s Gemelli hospital in the presence of priests.

 Rome Cardinal Camillo Ruini visited the Pope in the morning and later said he had found the Pontiff ?truly in good shape? and urged Catholics to ?stay calm and have full faith?. For Christians, Ash Wednesday marks the start of 40 days of fasting ahead of Easter. 

 They traditionally go to church to have ashes rubbed on their foreheads in a mark of penitence and humility. ?Remember that you are dust and unto dust you will return,? is the traditional phrase read by a priest as he smudges ashes on the foreheads of the faithful. In St Peter?s Basilica, the atmosphere was at once majestic and eerie as the service was held without the Pope. 

 Instead, Cardinal James Stafford rubbed the ashes on the foreheads of his fellow prelates of the Catholic Church.

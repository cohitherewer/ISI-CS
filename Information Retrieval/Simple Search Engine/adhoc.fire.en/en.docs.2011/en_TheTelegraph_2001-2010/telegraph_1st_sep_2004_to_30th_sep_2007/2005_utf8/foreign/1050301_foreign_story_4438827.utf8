 Lebanon govt quits

 Beirut, Feb. 28 (Reuters): Lebanon?s Syrian-backed government resigned today in a surprise move as thousands of protesters waving Lebanese flags rallied in central Beirut to demand the withdrawal of Syrian forces from the small country.

 Lebanon?s President Emile Lahoud accepted the resignation of the Syrian-backed government today and asked it to continue in a caretaker capacity. The presidential office, which announced the acceptance in a statement, did not say when Lahoud would start consulting parliamentary deputies to chose a successor to outgoing Prime Minister Omar Karami. 

 The resignation of the government came amid unprecedented public pressure and blame for former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri?s killing this month. ?The people have won,? main Opposition leader Walid Jumblatt told LBC television after Karami announced the resignation of the cabinet to a parliament session debating Hariri?s killing. Ecstatic protesters waving flags called for Syria to leave Lebanon where it has wielded political and military power for decades.

 International pressure is piling on Syria to quit its neighbour. Another Opposition figure Elias Atallah said the demonstrations must go on until Syria leaves. 

 ?Out of concern that the government does not become an obstacle to the good of the country, I announce the resignation of the government I had the honour to lead,? Karami said. His government had a majority and was expected to win a no-confidence vote that was meant to close a parliamentary debate on Hariri?s assassination.

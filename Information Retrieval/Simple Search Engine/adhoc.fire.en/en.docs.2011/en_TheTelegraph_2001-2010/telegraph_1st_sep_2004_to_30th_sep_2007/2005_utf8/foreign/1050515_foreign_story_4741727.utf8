 Shotgun, fishing gear top Bush gift list

 Washington, May 14 (Reuters): A $14,153 shotgun with accessories, a $2,700 bike and thousands of dollars worth of fishing gear topped the list of gifts received by President George W. Bush last year.

 While the Presidents gift list had a distinctly outdoor theme, vice-president Dick Cheney received more artistic presents such as paintings and a statue, according to annual financial disclosure documents released yesterday.

 Cheney gave Bush a $595 desk clock for Christmas that is currently telling time in the Oval Office. Bush gave the vice -president a $425 floor globe.

 In 2004, Bush received gifts that totalled $26,346, many from friends in his home state of Texas, and about four times the $5,934 value of gifts given to Cheney. The most expensive single gift Bush received was the shotgun with accessory tools from Roy Weatherby Jr. of California.

 Don Evans, the presidents close friend and former commerce secretary, gave him a fishing rod.

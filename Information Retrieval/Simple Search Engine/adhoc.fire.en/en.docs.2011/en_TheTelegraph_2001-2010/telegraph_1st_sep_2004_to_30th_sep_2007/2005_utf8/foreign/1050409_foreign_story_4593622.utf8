 Brosnan back in Bond frame

 HUGH DAVIES

 London, April 8: Pierce Brosnan is rumoured to be back in the running to play James Bond, with the studio unwilling to risk replacing him with a relative unknown.

 The British-based team behind the 20-film series were understood to have rejected him for a fifth film and Eon, their production team, had let Hollywood agents know they wanted to replace the 51-year-old Brosnan with a Bond ?who is 28 to 32 years old.?

 However, Variety, the industry newspaper, reported that the producers had ?patched things up? with Brosnan and were negotiating a two-film deal worth ?22 million, or a contract for a single film while a younger actor was groomed to take over.

 The newspaper said that, while Brosnan?s representatives denied that talks were taking place, Eon ?could do worse than keep on Brosnan, who took over the role when the franchise was on life support?. His Bond films had averaged ?200 million in box office takings, with Die Another Day setting a record with ?236 million. Daniel Craig, 37, the British actor, denied earlier this week that he had been offered a three-film deal.

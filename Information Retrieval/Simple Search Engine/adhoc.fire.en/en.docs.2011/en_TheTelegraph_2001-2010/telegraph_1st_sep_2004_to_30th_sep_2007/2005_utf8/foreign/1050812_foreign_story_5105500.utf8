 Oh God! No beer!

 Brussels, Aug. 11 (Reuters): Monks at a Belgian abbey have been forced to stop selling their famous beer after it was voted the best in the world and was promptly sold out.

 The abbey of Saint Sixtus of Westvleteren in western Belgium is home to some 30 Cistercian and Trappist monks who lead a life of seclusion, prayer, manual labour ? and beer-brewing.

 A survey of thousands of beer enthusiasts from 65 countries on the RateBeer website (www.ratebeer.com) in June rated the Westvleteren 12 beer as the worlds best. 

 But the abbey only has a limited brewing capacity, and was not able to cope with the beers sudden popularity.

 got a chance to add 180 kg of mortadella meat, 350 kg of 

 tomatoes and 250 kg of green peppers.

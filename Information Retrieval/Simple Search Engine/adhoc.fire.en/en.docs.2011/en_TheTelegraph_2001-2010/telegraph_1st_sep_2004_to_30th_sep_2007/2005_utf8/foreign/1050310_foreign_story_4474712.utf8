 Berlusconi plea to US

 Rome, March 9 (Reuters): The US must assume responsibility for the ?friendly fire? killing of an Italian intelligence agent in Iraq in order to put the incident behind the two allies, the Italian Prime Minister said today.

 The Italian leader welcomed an offer from the US to hold a joint investigation of last Friday?s shooting outside the Baghdad airport. Agent Nicola Calipari was shot dead as he was taking freed hostage Giuliana Sgrena to safety.

 Hawks defend judicial system in Pak state

 Islamabad, Aug. 3 (Reuters): Defending plans to introduce what critics say will be a Taliban-style judicial system, Islamists running a Pakistani province asked the Supreme Court today if it was bad to dissuade people doing wrong things.

 President Pervez Musharraf, who is trying to make Pakistan a progressive Muslim country, sought the top courts opinion after the controversial Hasba (accountability) bill was rushed through North West Frontier Provinces Assembly in Peshawar last month.

 The attorney-general told the court earlier this week that the NWFP bill would contravene the constitution as it amounted to setting up a parallel justice system and would infringe peoples rights, citing examples of how religious police in Afghanistan had terrified citizens during the Taliban regimes rule.

 Khalid Anwar, the lawyer for the provincial government, argued the Hasba bill was drafted on the recommendations of the Islamic Ideology Council, a constitutional advisory body meant to ensure laws conformed with Islam.

 This bill does not violate any provision of the constitution or any injunction of Islam, he told a nine-judge panel. Anwar said the Hasba bill did not sanction the use of force but sought to persuade people to implement Islamic teachings.

 Is there anything wrong with discouraging people from doing wrong things, he questioned. This (bill) is a noble cause that should be lauded and supported.

 Diplomats in Islamabad say Musharrafs handling of the bill will show how serious he is about containing and rolling back the religious right. The Supreme Court is expected to deliver its opinion later this week.

 If the bill was enacted, the provincial government would create a force of religious police controlled by Islamic clerics, a system critics say is modelled on the Talibans department of promotion of virtue and prevention of vice.

 Before the Taliban were driven from power in late 2001, religious police roamed Afghan streets, forcing people to pray and ensuring women did not leave home without a head-to-toe burkha.

 The tussle over the Hasba (accountability) bill is the latest in a long struggle between moderates and religious conservatives for the control of Pakistans future. The issue has erupted amid a recent government crackdown on militants, Islamist activists and firebrand preachers.

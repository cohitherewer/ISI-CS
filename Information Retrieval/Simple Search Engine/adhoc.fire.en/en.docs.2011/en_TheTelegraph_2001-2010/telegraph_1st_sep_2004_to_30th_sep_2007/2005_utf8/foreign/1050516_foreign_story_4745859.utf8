 Israel row on Madonna

 Jerusalem, May 15 (Reuters): Pop star Madonna was at the centre of a diplomatic tiff in Israel today involving the foreign minister, his celebrity wife and the ambassador to Washington.

 Channel Two TV said foreign minister Silvan Shaloms wife had an assistant to ambassador Danny Ayalon fired for failing to secure her an audience with Madonna when the singer, a follower of Kabbalah, or Jewish mysticism, visited Israel last September.

 Judy Shalom Nir Mozes denied the report. I dont meddle, thats not me, Shalom Nir Mozes, a television and radio host, told Channel Two.

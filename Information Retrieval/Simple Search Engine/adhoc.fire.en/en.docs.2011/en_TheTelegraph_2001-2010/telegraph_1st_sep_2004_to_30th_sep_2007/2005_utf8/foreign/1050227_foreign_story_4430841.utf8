 Israel beach blast hits peace

 Ramallah (West Bank), Feb. 26 (Reuters): Palestinian forces, under pressure for tough action after a suicide bombing killed four Israelis, arrested at least three Palestinians today but suggested Lebanon?s Hizbollah group was behind the attack.

 Yesterday?s bombing at a Tel Aviv nightclub on a beach promenade frequented by weekend revellers dealt a blow to growing peace hopes since President Mahmoud Abbas agreed a ceasefire with Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon at a groundbreaking February 8 summit.

 Israel said the bombing showed Abbas was wrong if he thought he could coax militants into a formal ceasefire from their current de facto truce and demanded vigorous action. But officials said the Jewish state would show restraint for now.

 ?We will not tolerate this act,? Abbas said as he met security chiefs to talks strategy. ?We will not allow anyone to sabotage the goals and ambitions of our people... We will bring them to justice.?

 Abbas blamed an unnamed ?third party? for involvement in the attack. A senior Palestinian security official involved in the investigation said inquiries indicated Hizbollah?s hand. ?All the information that we have until now from interrogations shows that Hizbollah is involved in the operation,? the official said.

 In Beirut, Hizbollah denied any role and called the accusations a provocation by ?the Zionist entity? (Israel).

 Both Israel and the Palestinians have recently accused the Iranian-backed group of trying to sabotage peace efforts, though political commentators say the Palestinians could benefit from shifting the blame away from home.

 A cell of the militant Islamic Jihad group in the West Bank claimed the attack, but the faction?s leadership in the Gaza Strip denied any knowledge and said it would continue to maintain calm. Other mainstream groups also denied any role.

 Security officials gave the names of three men arrested at the presumed bomber?s village of Deir al-Ghoson ? the first suspected militants held since Abbas succeeded late President Yasser Arafat in January. Israeli troops arrested five others in a raid on the West Bank village, including two brothers of the suspected bomber.

 The images of ambulances rushing to the popular karaoke club and the blood-stained pavement shook many Israelis, who had begun to believe they had put such scenes behind them. The last such bombing killed three people in Tel Aviv on November 1. Israeli officials demanded Palestinian action instead of more talks to woo armed groups.

 ?Words are not enough. We must see action,? said Gideon Meir of Israel?s foreign ministry. ?We must see arrests, collecting illegal weapons from those terrorist organisations ... The only language they understand is force.? A 25-nation conference in London this week is due to look at ways to help Palestinians improve security forces and build Israeli confidence.

 The family in Deir al-Ghoson announced through loudspeakers that Abdullah Shelbayeh ?had carried out a martyrdom operation?. But there was little sign of the celebration that has often followed bombings. US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice demanded that Palestinian leaders find those responsible and ?send a clear message that terror will not be tolerated?.

 Washington has stepped up efforts to revive the peace process after Abbas was elected to succeed late President Yasser Arafat, whom Israel and the US saw as an obstacle.

 Palestinian militant factions have said they are still not satisfied with Israeli gestures.

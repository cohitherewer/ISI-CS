 Yawn! But long live communist mantras

 PETER GOFF 

 Beijing, Oct. 30: Which of the following is the best way for the Chinese Communist Party to lead the country in the 21st century? 

 Is it (A) to respect labour, knowledge, talent and creation? (B) to innovate societys management systems? or (C) to scrap boring multiple-choice examinations about Chinese Communist Party ideology? 

 The correct answer, officially at least, is (A), although for a growing number of new Chinas upwardly mobile workers, the most tempting option is (C). 

 Despite embracing capitalism in all but name, the countrys communist government insists that anyone wanting to get ahead must pass university and school exams dealing with the propaganda of successive communist leaders. 

 From the thoughts of Chairman Mao to the slogans of Jiang Zemin, a firm grasp of politburo prose is compulsory for pupils, students and ambitious party members. 

 Now, just as a new generation was hoping that the Marxist textbooks might finally be consigned to history, President Hu Jintao, Chinas current leader, has insisted that his own turgid rhetoric must be added to the curriculum. 

 Apparently afraid that his diktats might be swept away by the rapid social change he has allowed, Hu Jintao has included them on the list of tracts to be memorised. 

 It is an absolute waste of time. It is very, very heavy theory that bears no relevance to modern China, said Sunny Zhang, an economics student. 

 I spent two semesters studying Marxism, both philosophy and economics, and they said they were important principles for governing China. But China is now capitalist, even though they call it socialism with Chinese characteristics. 

 Such is the volume of complex and often contradictory texts that political studies is one of the most loathed subjects on any curriculum. For all degree courses one must pass a politics entrance exam. 

 The addition of Hus rambling sayings ? including Promote a harmonious society and Keep the advancement of the Party ? is not just about flattering the leaders vanity, however. 

 With Chinas economic boom bringing increasing political unrest, his supporters believe that healthy doses of communist pieties are just the thing to remind the nation who is boss. 

 To that end, a nationwide education campaign has been drumming the thoughts and deeds of the Hu government into the heads of managers in the countrys offices, factories and community associations, in addition to the rank-and-file party members.

 Among the campaigns triumphs has been Shao Yin, a deaf, illiterate 106-year-old woman, who has been tutored in Hu-speak by her 80-year-old son. 

 She can now recite his convoluted utterances almost faultlessly. 

 Less enthusiastic is a party member Li Hongying, 50, from Inner Mongolia. She was busy copying party slogans.

 The country should persist in the partys basic line, programme and experiences, comprehensively implement the scientific development concept, brace their spirits, do sound work and be eager to forge ahead, reads one. 

 What does that all mean? she said. Frankly, I havent got a clue.

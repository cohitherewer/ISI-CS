 Pakistani abducted

 Baghdad, April 10 (Reuters): A militant group today claimed to have kidnapped a Pakistani working in the country?s embassy in Baghdad, officials in Pakistan said, confirming the latest abduction of a foreigner in Iraq?s capital.

 ?Persons claiming to be members of Omar bin Khattab group have apparently kidnapped the official,? said a Pakistani foreign ministry statement released in Islamabad.

 The official, Malik Mohammad Javed, went missing after prayers yesterday in Baghdad. ?Malik Javed has contacted our charge d?affaires in Baghdad informing that he is safe,? the statement added.

 The Omar bin Khattab group has not previously been heard of or been mentioned as one of the militant organisations engaged in the kidnapping business in Iraq.

 An embassy official and Iraqi police identified Javed as the Pakistani consul, but Pakistan?s foreign ministry said he was an embassy staff member, not a diplomat.

 Putting a stop to rampant kidnapping is one of the major security challenges facing Iraq?s government.

 Poll ruling blow to Chandrika

 Colombo, Aug. 26 (Reuters): Sri Lankas Supreme Court today ruled a presidential election was due in 2005, handing a victory to the political foes of outgoing President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who wanted to stay in power for another year.

 Kumaratunga, who was first elected in 1994, went for re-election to a six-year term a year early in 1999. 

 She claims she is entitled to stay in office for 12 years since the constitution allows a President a maximum of two six-year terms.

 A bitter political squabble with her opponents drove the issue into the courts.

 According to the constitution, and the interpretations heard earlier... I hold the Presidents second term in office commenced on December 22, 1999, and will end six years from that date, Chief Justice Sarath. N. Silva said. 

 Elections commissioner Dayananda Dissanayake said an election would be held this year.

 It is dead sure that it is this year, Dissanayake said. It must be between October 21 and November 21, he added, saying he would fix the definitive date next week.

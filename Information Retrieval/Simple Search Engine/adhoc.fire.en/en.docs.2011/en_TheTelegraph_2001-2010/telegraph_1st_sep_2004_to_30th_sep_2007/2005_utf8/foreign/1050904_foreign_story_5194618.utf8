 Music stops in the Big Easy

 Washington, Sept. 3: The Big Easy is no more. 

 One hundred and ten years after the first jazz band was born in New Orleans, the saxophones have fallen silent in Congo Square, now known as the French Quarter, and on steamboats with loads of tourists that perpetually floated along the Mississippi river and in homes where the sound of music instantly conveyed to first-time visitors the character of one of Americas greatest cities founded by the French in 1718.

 For 306 years, New Orleans was the original home of Mardi Gras, the annual celebration, when the Big Easy lived up to its other name: the City that Care Forgot. For two weeks in the second half of every February, all of New Orleans became a party arena, when a drink was rarely refused to anyone, never mind the American aberration of 21 as the drinking age across the nation. New Orleans was a city that did not wait for Mardi Gras to celebrate. Every night was party night in the Big Easy. The city that never sleeps. That was New Orleans, not New York. 

 In a few days, New Orleans will be a ghost town, except for workers who will come in to see what can be salvaged of the once beautiful and impressive city that has been rendered dysfunctional by Hurricane Katrina. Every resident has been ordered out. New Orleans is no longer livable. 

 Some 80 per cent of the city is still under water. In some quarters, water is up to 15 feet deep. Along the major highway linking eastern US with New Orleans, the Interstate 10, it is as if parts of the road have been bombed out in an aerial attack.

 The city no longer has any drinking water. Its entire potable water supply will have to be flushed out and cleaned for protection against contamination. Nearly a million people in the state of Louisiana are estimated to be without power. Add to that a quarter million in Mississippi, another 300,000 in Alabama and 100,000 in Florida. 

 At least one and a half million phones are out of order in these four states. Even if New Orleans is salvaged, the damage such a salvage can do to the environment will be lasting. All the metals and chemicals and waste from the city ? and other affected areas ? will be pumped into the Gulf of Mexico, where it will cause long-term, if not permanent damage, to the ecological balance. 

 President George W Bush, who toured the affected areas yesterday, tried to put a brave face to a catastrophic scenario and predicted that New Orleans will rise again. Few are prepared to face the truth. One of those few is Hugh Kaufman, senior policy analyst at the Environmental Protection Agency. 

 Kaufman has been telling reporters that there is not enough money in the GNP of the US to dispose of the amount of hazardous material in the area.

 Blair rocked by defection

 London, April 26: Defection is now more a part of politics in Britain than in India. 

 Today, in the biggest setback to Tony Blair of the general election campaign so far, a long time Labour MP quit his party for the Liberal Democrats over Iraq and urged voters to give the Prime Minister a ?bloody nose?.

 Opinion polls show that Blair is headed for a third term in office but events such as the defection of Brian Sedgemore, who has been a Labour party member for 37 years, 27 of them as MP, reveals the depth of unhappiness within New Labour.

 Sedgemore, who will not be contesting his London seat in Hackney South and Shoreditch on May 5, appeared today alongside the Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy at his early morning news conference. 

 The 68-year-old former MP said: ?The idea and practice of Britain as a liberal country has always been under threat but it has taken a Labour Prime Minister to secure its demise. 

 ?For Tony Blair, his scorn for liberal Britain is surprising for one who has an expensive liberal education and he entered politics as an aspirant liberal lawyer, an ardent member of CND (Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament) and a standard-bearer for the Left.?

 Sedgemore did not mince his words. He said he was joining the Liberal Democrats to ?work for a nobler vision of Britain?.

 He continued: ?All the deeply illiberal measures passed by the government, ferociously and heroically opposed by a number of backbench MPs, myself included, as well as by the Liberal Democrats collectively. I urge everyone from the Centre and Left in British politics to give Blair a bloody nose at the election and to vote for the Liberal Democrats in recognition of the fact that the tawdry New Labour project is dead.?

 Of the three main parties, only the Liberal Democrats have consistently opposed the war against Iraq. Kennedy said: ?Brian Sedgemore?s message for other people who are considering voting Labour but who are unhappy with the party?s policies on Iraq, tuition fees and civil liberties is clear. At this election, the only party which has taken principled stands on these issues is the Liberal Democrats.?

 In a newspaper article today, Sedgemore has revealed that he is one of a group of retiring Labour MPs who are planning to quit the party after the election. 

 Sedgemore was asked why he had timed his defection so late in the day. He said there had been a gradual ?build-up? in his disaffection with Labour and he eventually decided that he had had enough. 

 But he also pointed out that he had opposed the government on Iraq and other key measures such as the anti-terrorism bill at the time.

 Asked for details of other possible Labour defections, he said: ?I can be absolutely sure what I am saying is right because I was one of them.? He added: ?Only one thing can be said with certainty about the results of this general election. The number of abstentions will be colossal and who could blame the electorate.?

 He said: ?If being British does not entail a longing for liberty, then having such an identity is worthless. If a political party does not yearn for freedom based on the rule of law, habeas corpus and due protest, there is no point being a member of it or voting for it. It is against this background that I finally decided I could no longer support the Labour government and will join the Liberal Democrats.?

 At his morning news conference, the Prime Minister shrugged off Sedgemore?s defection. Blair said the ?fate of one individual and his political preference should not detract? from Labour?s overall campaign?. 

 He commented: ?If he wants to choose to vote Liberal Democrat, and there?s not going to be a Liberal Democrat government, that?s up to him.?

 The Prime Minister was repeatedly pressed over Sedgemore?s decision to switch to the Liberal Democrats, partly over his opposition to the Iraq war. ?What he does is up to him. He is not even a candidate at the election,? Blair said.

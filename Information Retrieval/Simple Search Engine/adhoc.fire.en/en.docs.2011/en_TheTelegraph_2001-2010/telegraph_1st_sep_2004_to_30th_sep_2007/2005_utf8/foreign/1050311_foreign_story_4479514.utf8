 Sex bias slur on IKEA

 Oslo, March 10 (Reuters): Swedish home furnishings giant IKEA is guilty of sex discrimination by showing only men putting together furniture in its instruction manuals, Norway?s Prime Minister said.

 IKEA, which has more than 200 stores in 32 nations, fears it might offend Muslims by depicting women assembling everything from cupboards to beds. Its manuals show only men or cartoon figures whose sex is unclear.

 ?This isn?t good enough,? Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik was quoted today as telling the daily Verdens Gang. ?It?s important to promote attitudes for sexual equality, not least in Muslim nations.?

 ?They should change this,? he said. IKEA stores are visited by 365 million people a year around the world.

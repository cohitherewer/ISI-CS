 Book clubs put women on top

 CHRIS HASTINGS

 Rowling: Woman power

 London, July 24: Once they had to disguise their identity just to get published. Now female writers are more likely than their male rivals to top bestseller lists ? and thats because of book clubs.

 Britains 50,000 book groups, which are largely made up of women, have boosted the sales of female writers to record levels.

 Half of the titles on the UK top 50 fiction list, compiled by Nielsen Book Scan ? the most reliable guide to book sales in the UK ? for the week ending Saturday July 16, were written by women. 

 By contrast, women were responsible for just a third of the titles on the list a decade ago. For the first time, more than half the books on The New York Times bestseller list are by by women.

 On the Nielsen list, JK Rowlings Harry Potter and The Half-Blood Prince, which sold two million copies on its first day of release, not surprisingly, held the top spot for that week. But four other writers: Maeve Binchy, whose book has so far sold 68,000 in paper back was in second place, Lynda La Plante, Cecelia Ahern and Martina Cole also had titles in the top 10.

 All four titles are popular with book clubs.

 Kathy Reichs and her book Cross Bones led the top 10 hardback fiction list on the Nielsen list for the week ending July 9. Five other women made it into the top 10. 

 The new success is in stark contrast to sales figures previously achieved by women writers. Figures compiled by Lulu, a publishing Internet site to be launched in Britain later this month, show that in the 1980s less than a quarter of the books to top the New York Times list were by women writers.

 The proliferation of reading groups has revolutionised the book trade and the nations reading habits. 

 A book club run by Channel Fours Richard and Judy programme can propel a title to the top of the bestsellers list. A list of the top 20 books favoured by British groups has 11 female authors on it.

 Jenny Hartley, the author of The Book Groups Book said there was no doubt this bias was having an impact on sales. I think more women are writing fiction than ever before and the groups are fuelling demand for those books, she said. Reading groups have a lot of women members and they tend to prefer reading women writers.

 JG Ballard, the author of Crash and Empire Of The Sun, said the demand for female fiction was in complete contrast to the 1960s when men were the main buyers of novels. I think 30 years ago, men were the main buyers of novels because they had the spending power and women did not.

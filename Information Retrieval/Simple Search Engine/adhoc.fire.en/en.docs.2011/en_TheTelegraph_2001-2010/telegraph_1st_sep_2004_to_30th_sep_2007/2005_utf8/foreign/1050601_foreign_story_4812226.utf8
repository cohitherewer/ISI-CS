 Fine Print

 Prague Piano Man

 London, May 31: The hunt to establish the identity of the Piano Man switched to Prague on Sunday on the basis of a 22-year-old picture of a teenager with a stocking over his head, according to The Daily Telegraph. 

 The name Tomas Strnad has came to the fore as a possible identity for the mute man found wandering by a beach on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, almost two months ago who reportedly comes alive when he plays the piano. The picture of Strnad, reproduced in a tabloid newspaper, was supplied by Klaudius Kryspin, a Czech rock drummer who says he knew immediately the man was Strnad, with whom he says he played in a pop group as a teenager. 

 Bully penalty: shed weight

 Rome (Reuters): An Italian judge has found a teenage boy guilty of vandalism, slander and disturbing the peace ? but instead of jail time, he ordered the 100 kg bully to slim down. His weight has made the 17-year-old naughty and a diet would reinforce his self-esteem, the judge was quoted as saying in the Il Messaggero newspaper on Tuesday.

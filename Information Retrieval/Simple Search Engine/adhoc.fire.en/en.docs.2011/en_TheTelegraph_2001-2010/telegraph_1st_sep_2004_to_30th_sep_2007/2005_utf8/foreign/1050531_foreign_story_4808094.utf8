 China slams US, EU for export curbs

 Beijing/Shanghai, May 30 (Reuters): China today hit out at the US and the EU for curbing Chinese textile exports, saying the restrictions were justified neither by trade law nor by statistics.

 Commerce minister Bo Xilai said Washington and Brussels had failed to prove their domestic markets had been disrupted by an increase in Chinese exports since a 40-year-old system of quotas on developing countries exports of textiles expired on January 1.

 Bo said China was willing to hold talks, but he was scathing about the double standards of rich countries that flew the flag of free trade but rushed to throw up barriers when poor nations started to exploit their comparative advantage of cheap labour.

 The EU and the US should spend more time on the development of high technology ? Airbus or Boeing aeroplanes, and advanced modern machinery ? rather than spending time quarrelling with us on issues like shirts, socks and trousers.

 Bo was speaking hours after China said it would scrap export tariffs on 81 textile products, making good on its threat to roll back the taxes if the West imposed curbs on its goods.

 The tit-for-tat move followed a formal request on Friday by the EU for talks with China over surging shipments of T-shirts and flax yarn, which have fanned fears of widescale bankruptcies and lay-offs in the 25-member bloc.

 China now has 15 days to limit this years increase in exports of the two products to 7.5 per cent over 2004 levels, otherwise the EU will enforce the limits itself.

 Washington imposed similar quotas on Chinese-made trousers, underwear, shirts and other goods in mid-May.

 Bo said the measures violated WTO rules and discriminated against China. He also disputed the evidence marshalled by the two governments to justify the curbs.

 The EU and US imposed quotas on Chinese textiles based on primary data obtained in a short period of just three or four months and made a cursory decision. They are groundless and unscientific, Bo said. In our opinion this move lacks legal grounding and therefore is incorrect.

 The EU immediately rejected Beijings charge. We have shown that not only is there a surge in imports from China but also ... that there is an immediate risk for (European) companies, European Commission spokeswoman Claude Veron-Reville said in Brussels. But Bo said textiles were more important to China, where 19 million people depended on the industry for their living. 

 Exports of $2.3 billion were at risk due to the US and EU curbs. Against this background, he said China had no choice but to scale back the export taxes it had voluntarily introduced.

 Ukraine govt sacked as Orange revolution sours

 Kiev, Sept. 8 (Reuters): Ukraines President Viktor Yushchenko sacked his government today as the team which led the Orange Revolution less than a year ago broke apart amid infighting and accusations of mass graft.

 Yushchenko, who has pledged to stamp out the corruption widespread under his long-serving predecessor Leonid Kuchma, said he would ask regional governor Yury Yekhanurov, 57, to form a new team.

 But he sought not to completely alienate the charismatic Yulia Tymoshenko, a key figure in the mass protests late last year that propelled him to power and who until today had been Prime Minister since his election in January. The sackings could set the stage for a standoff between Yuschenko and Tymoshenko, who heads her own party, when Ukraine votes in a parliamentary election in March 2006.

 These people remain my friends. It is very difficult but today I must remove this Gordian knot, Yushchenko said, accusing his outgoing government of lacking team spirit.

 I set one task for the new team ? to work in a united team. I do not want any more of the intrigues between two or three people that were determining the state policy.

 The sacked Prime Minister was due to make her first public comments on Ukrainian television tomorrow.

 Some analysts said they hoped Yekhanurov, a low-key technocrat and Yushchenko loyalist, would bring discipline to Ukraines economic policy, which under Tymoshenko was characterised by public rows and inconsistency. Yekhanurov was meeting members of the old cabinet this evening.

 In sacking Tymoshenko, whose fiery oratory brought thousands out on the streets in last Decembers pro-western Orange Revolution, Yushchenko moved decisively to end a crisis that has threatened his credibility.

 The crisis follows months of tension between Yushchenko and Tymoshenko over Ukraines economic direction and came to a head last Saturday when his chief of staff quit alleging deep corruption in the administration.

 We need to halt the disappointment in society and make sure that the ideals (of the Orange Revolution) are not cast into doubt, he said.

 The allegations of graft hurt a government already tarnished by sharply lower economic growth, rising inflation and inconsistent policies.

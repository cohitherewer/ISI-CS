 Hard rock hurts heart

 Recipe for heart attack?

 New York, Oct. 8 (Reuters): A new study has shown that listening to music that has a slow or meditative tempo has a relaxing effect on people, slowing their breathing and heart rate, whereas listening to faster music with a more upbeat tempo has the opposite effect ? speeding up respiration and heart rate.

 The results, which appear in the journal Heart, support a growing body of research on the potential stress-reducing health benefits of music.

 Other research has shown that music can alleviate stress, improve athletic performance, improve movement in neurologically impaired patients with stroke or Parkinsons disease, and even boost milk production in cattle, Peter Sleight from the University of Oxford and colleagues noted.

 The investigators monitored the subjects during two-minute musical intermissions. Half of the subjects were trained musicians; the other half had no musical training.

 The style of the music or an individuals music preference seems less important than the tempo of the music. They also found that calm is induced by slower rhythms and, interestingly, by short pauses or intermissions in the music. Pausing the music for two minutes induces a condition of relaxation greater than that observed before subjects began listening.

 These effects are most striking for people who have musical training, perhaps because they have learned to synchronise their breathing. 

 Musicians breathe faster with faster tempo, and had slower baseline breathing rates than non-musicians. Sleight and co-workers speculate that music may give pleasure (and perhaps health benefits) as a result of a controlled alteration between arousal and relaxation.

 They conclude that the appropriate selection of music ? alternating fast and slower rhythms interspersed with pauses ? can be used to induce relaxation.

 Saudi gifts millions to Harvard

 CARYLE MURPHY

 Washington, Dec. 13: A 

 prominent Saudi businessman said yesterday that he is donating 

 $20 million each to Georgetown and Harvard universities 

 for the study of Islam and the Muslim world as part of his 

 philanthropic efforts to promote interfaith understanding.

 Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal, a member 

 of the Saudi royal family, said in a telephone interview 

 from Riyadh that he also has donated $15 million to set 

 up East Asias first two centres for American studies, 

 at universities in Beirut and Cairo.

 As you know, since the 9/11 events, the image of Islam 

 has been tarnished in the West, said Alwaleed, who 

 is chairman of the Riyadh-based Kingdom Holding Co. and 

 has extensive business holdings in Europe and the US.

 He said his gifts to Georgetown 

 and Harvard will be used to teach about the Islamic 

 world to the United States, and the new programmes 

 at American University in Beirut and American University 

 in Cairo will teach the Arab world about the American 

 situation.

 The $20-million gift to Georgetown 

 is the second-largest ever received by the Jesuit-run university, 

 school officials said. It will be used to expand the activities 

 of its 12-year-old Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding.

 We are deeply honoured by 

 Prince Alwaleeds generosity, said a statement 

 from Georgetown President John J. DeGioia, who met Alwaleed 

 on November 7 in a Paris hotel to sign documents formalising 

 the donation.

 Alwaleed, a grandson of the Saudi 

 kingdoms founder, King Abdel Aziz, tried to give $10 

 million to the Twin Towers Fund shortly after the terrorist 

 attacks of September 2001. 

 But then New York Mayor Rudolph 

 W. Giuliani rejected the donation after the prince said 

 in a statement that the US needed to re-examine its 

 policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stance 

 towards the Palestinian cause.

 Asked about the controversy over 

 his New York gift, Alwaleed replied that this is behind 

 us and now we are working for the present and the future. 

 . . . My love and admiration to the US was never diminished.

 The Georgetown centre, part of 

 the universitys School of Foreign Service, will be 

 renamed the Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian 

 Understanding.

 340 flee burning Pak plane in UK

 Manchester, March 1: About 340 passengers have fled a plane at Manchester airport amid fears that the undercarriage had caught fire during refuelling.

 The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) flight was stationed on a runway at Manchester during a scheduled stopover between Karachi and Toronto. A number of people have suffered minor injuries, police said.

 The Boeing 777 landed at Manchester at 9.03 am (GMT), but shortly afterwards the left side of the main undercarriage was thought to have caught fire and passengers and crew were taken off the aircraft via emergency slides. About 340 passengers and 12 crew were on board flight PK789.

 A spokeswoman for National Air Traffic Services (Nats) said: ?The aircraft landed perfectly OK, but as it was taxi-ing, the aircraft behind it reported smoke coming from the port undercarriage. 

 ?Nats at Manchester reported an aircraft ground incident and by the time the fire brigade got to the plane, passengers were already being evacuated.?

 She went on: ?The airport was shut for about 15 minutes. One runway has reopened and the second one will be operational again when the fire services have finished at the plane.?

 Later, the police said the aircraft did not catch fire but had overheated. 

 A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: ?The fire brigade attended but there was no evidence that a fire actually started, although it is believed overheating may have occurred in the undercarriage.? A spokeswoman for Pakistan International Airlines said: ?Everyone on board is fine.?

 Drugs warning

 Pakistan warned on Tuesday it would be unable to combat narcotics flooding in from neighbouring Afghanistan unless international assistance was increased.

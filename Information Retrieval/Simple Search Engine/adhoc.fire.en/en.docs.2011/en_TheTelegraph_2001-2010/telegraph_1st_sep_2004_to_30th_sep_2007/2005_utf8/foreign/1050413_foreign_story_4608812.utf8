 Bangla rescue clock ticks

 Palashbari (Bangladesh), April 12 (Reuters): Rescuers today struggled to reach up to 150 Bangladeshi workers trapped under the rubble of a nine-storey garment factory that collapsed during a busy night shift, killing at least 26 people.

 Rescuers said time was quickly running out for survivors buried under the huge pile of bricks, concrete slabs and twisted metal rods.

 Army and fire brigade officials said they believed around 100-150 people were still trapped. ?But it is really impossible to give an exact number,? said fire brigade official Fariduddin Ahmed.

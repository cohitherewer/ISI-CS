 Response team chief quits

 Washington, Sept. 12 (Reuters): The director of the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) Michael Brown resigned yesterday after being recalled to Washington amid criticism of the federal response to Hurricane Katrina.

 In an apparent nod to demands that Brown be replaced by someone with experience in emergency response, President George W. Bush replaced Brown with David Paulison, a veteran firefighter who now runs Femas preparedness division.

 Paulison was also the Homeland Security official who urged Americans to stock up on duct tape and plastic sheeting in 2003 to protect against a biological or chemical attack. Brown, who was widely criticised for a slow federal response to the devastating Hurricane Katrina, resigned effective immediately.

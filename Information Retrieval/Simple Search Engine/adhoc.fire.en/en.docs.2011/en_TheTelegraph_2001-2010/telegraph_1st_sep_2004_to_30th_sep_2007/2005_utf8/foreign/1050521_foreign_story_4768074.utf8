 Bush should have been told about scare: Laura

 Laura Bush

 Shannon (Ireland), May 20 (Reuters): Contradicting the White House line, US First Lady Laura Bush said yesterday the President should have been interrupted during a bike ride to be told about a plane scare that sent fighter jets scrambling over Washington and forced her to take cover in a bunker.

 I think he should have been interrupted, but Im not going to second-guess the Secret Service that were with him, Laura Bush said during her flight to Jordan to start a five-day solo visit to West Asia. Her plane stopped in Shannon to refuel.

 The First Lady said she hoped her visit to Jordan, Israel and Egypt would help counter rising anti-American sentiment in the Muslim world, fuelled by the war in Iraq and, more recently, by a Newsweek magazine report that the Quran was desecrated by US interrogators. Newsweek has since retracted that report.

 I hope that West Asia, the broader West Asia, get to know Americans like we really are, she said. I dont think they really have the sense of Americans being religious ... being tolerant of every religion. She blamed terrible happenings, including the prison abuse scandal at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, for having really, really hurt our image.

 Laura Bush said the trip would give her an opportunity to press for expanding womens rights in West Asia, adding: In a democracy, everybody has to participate or it wont work.

 But she said: I want people in West Asia to know, too, that we dont think we have every answer, that were not trying to answer every question for them.

 Ahead of her stop in Cairo, the First Lady said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak should agree to fair elections.

 President Mubarak is very popular in Egypt. Hes very well liked, and its very important for him, as well as for the country, as well as an example for the rest of the countries in the broader West Asia to show that Egypt can have free and fair elections, Laura Bush said.

 Allawi in poll vow, 15 die in raid

 Baghdad, Jan. 5 (Reuters): A suicide car bomber killed at least 15 people at an Iraqi police academy today, but Prime Minister Iyad Allawi vowed to stick to his timetable for a January 30 election despite escalating attacks.

 The bomber barrelled his way into a compound in the town of Hilla, south of Baghdad in a lawless area known as the ?Triangle of Death?, and blew up his explosives-filled vehicle after coming under heavy fire, police spokesman Hadi Hatif said.

 The attack was the latest by insurgents targeting Iraq?s US-backed interim government and its fledgling security services in a bloody campaign to sabotage the election.

 It came a day after gunmen assassinated Baghdad?s provincial governor and a suicide truck bomber killed 11 people outside a police commando headquarters in a surge of violence that drew fresh calls for delaying the national ballot.

 ?The government is committed to running the elections on schedule,? Allawi said in the Green Zone, home to the Iraqi government and the US and British embassies.

 But even as Allawi made his pledge, attacks continued unabated.

 A hospital official in Hilla, about 100 km from Baghdad, said at least 13 people were killed and 25 wounded in bombing at the academy, which had been due to hold a graduation ceremony.

 Hours earlier, a car bomb targeting a US military convoy killed two Iraqi bystanders in western Baghdad, police said.

 In the volatile northern city of Mosul, a leading Sunni politician was found shot dead a day after he was kidnapped from his pharmacy.

 In a fresh sign of divisions over the election, Iraqi President Ghazi al-Yawar, the government?s senior Sunni official, urged the UN yesterday to look into whether the country should hold the polls as scheduled. Yawar said the polls would fail if an insurgency kept a significant number of Sunnis away from voting.

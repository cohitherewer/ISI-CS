 Iran tops trouble list: US 

 - Cheney worried Israel might ?act first?

 Washington, Jan. 21 (Reuters): Vice-president Dick Cheney said yesterday that Iran was at the top of the administration?s list of world trouble spots and expressed concern that Israel ?might well decide to act first? to eliminate any nuclear threat from Tehran.

 ?You look around the world at potential trouble spots, Iran is right at the top of the list,? Cheney said in an interview aired on MSNBC on the day that George W. Bush was sworn in for a second four-year term as President.

 Cheney, one of the chief architects of the Iraq war, said the administration would continue to try to use diplomacy to address what he said were serious concerns about Iran?s nuclear weapons programme and ties to terrorism.

 The administration has also accused Iran of interfering in the affairs of neighbouring Iraq.

 If Iran resists demands to rein in its nuclear programme, Cheney said the next step would be to take the matter to the UN Security Council and seek international sanctions ?to force them to live up to the commitments and obligations.?

 Cheney described Iran?s nuclear programme as ?fairly robust.? Iran denies its nuclear facilities are to be used to make weapons. Cheney, who was a leading advocate for the Iraq invasion,said one concern was that Israel might act against the Iranians ?without being asked.?

 ?If, in fact, the Israelis became convinced the Iranians had significant nuclear capability, given the fact that Iran has a stated policy that their objective is the destruction of Israel, the Israelis might well decide to act first, and let the rest of the world worry about cleaning up the diplomatic mess afterwards,? Cheney said.

 Israel set a precedent for such action in 1981 when it sent warplanes to destroy Iraq?s French-built Osiraq reactor, seen as the key to President Saddam Hussein?s nuclear ambitions.

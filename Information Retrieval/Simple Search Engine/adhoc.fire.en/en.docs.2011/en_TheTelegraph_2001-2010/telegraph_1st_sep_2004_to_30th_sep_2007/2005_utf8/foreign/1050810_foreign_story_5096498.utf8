 Britney bash

 Los Angeles, Aug. 8 (Reuters): Britney Spears and her security staff denied knowledge yesterday of the pellet-gun shooting of a photographer who was staking out a private baby shower for the singer in Malibu.

 Paparazzi photographer Brad Diaz said he was struck in the thigh by a pellet on Saturday outside the mansion where the pregnant star was visiting and enjoying a party thrown for her. Britney didnt know anything about it, said Spears publicist, Nicole King.

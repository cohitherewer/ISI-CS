 Annan impressed, depressed by quake

 Muzaffarabad (Pakistan), Nov. 18 (Reuters): UN secretary-general Kofi Annan visited earthquake-hit Kashmir today to highlight the misery of people living in the disaster zone and Pakistans dire need for over $5 billion of world aid.

 Brought by helicopter, Annan and President Pervez Musharraf saw from the air some of the miserable tent villages sheltering thousands of families in the ruins of Muzaffarabad, before visiting one on the outskirts.

 I have been impressed by what I have seen ... and depressed, Annan said at the camp of 2,000 tents on a river bank, ringed by mountains.

 Depressed by the number of the houses that have been destroyed and that need to be rebuilt, but impressed by the level of cooperation and determination.

 Accompanied by their wives, Annan and Musharraf saw medical staff administering anti-polio drops and measles jabs, as part of a massive vaccination campaign to ward off the threat of disease.

 Soldiers toting automatic weapons watched from rooftops, and routes used by the UN chief and the Pakistani President were closed as part of a huge anti-terrorist security operation.

 Police halted about 50 marchers from a Kashmir independence party, that wants the disputed region free of both Pakistani and Indian control, but there was no trouble.

 With the Himalayan winter closing in, Musharraf and Annan say donor nations should dig deeper to fund a relief effort more daunting even than that after Asias tsunami.

 We often talk of tsunami, and we did because it did kill so many people and affected so many countries, Annan said.

 But you look at the terrain here, and logistical challenges which have to be overcome in order to get aid to the people ? it is really, really a gigantic task we have ahead of us. The October 8 tremor killed more than 73,000 people in Pakistan, left around 500,000 homeless and affected around 3.3 million people.

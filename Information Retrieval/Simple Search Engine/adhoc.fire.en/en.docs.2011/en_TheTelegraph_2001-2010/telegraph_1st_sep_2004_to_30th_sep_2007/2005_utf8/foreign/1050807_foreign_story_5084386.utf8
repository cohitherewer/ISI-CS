 Bank freezes failed bombers accounts

 The Bank of England in London

 London, Aug. 6 (PTI): The Bank of England has frozen the financial accounts belonging to the four failed July 21 bombers as Scotland Yard investigates allegations that the men collected more than ?500,000 in benefit payments in Britain. 

 The Bank of England listed the mens various names and personal details on its website accompanied by a statement which said the Bank of England, agent for Her Majestys treasury, has today directed that any funds held for or on behalf of individuals named must be frozen, and that no funds or financial should be made available, directly or indirectly to any person, except under the authority of a licence.

 Bank officials disclosed the financial details of the suspects, Ramzi Mohammad, Yasin Hassan Omar, Muktar Said-Ibrahim and Hussain Osman, which showed how the men, all in custody, have used multiple aliases and addresses in recent years.

 Ibrahim is said to have had six aliases. Some are also shown to have claimed several nationalities, ages and national insurance numbers while in Britain.

 Investigators believe that bogus names were used to make some benefit claims. Scotland Yard was investigating allegations that the men collected more than ?500,000 in benefit payments in britain.

 Two are also alleged to have obtained asylum using bogus passports and false names and nationalities, the police said. 

 All the addresses registered to the suspects were in greater London, and each man is known to have had at least one national insurance number. Twenty three-year-old Mohammed, who has been linked to the Oval tube attack, is said to have used six addresses in southwest and west London. One is said to be on the Peabody Estate, in north Kensington, where he surrendered to police with Ibrahim last Friday.

 Ibrahim, alleged to be the Hackney bus bomber is believed to have used two dates of birth, six aliases, two national insurance numbers and two addresses ? both in the Stoke Newington area of north London. 

 Twenty seven-year-old Osman, now fighting extradition from Italy and accused of being the Shepherds Bush attacker, apparently went under five names, variously claimed that he was Eritrean or Somali, and used four addresses in southwest London. 

 Omar, 24, who is linked with the attack on a tube train near Warren Street, had five aliases and lived in new Southgate.

 Police across Europe are investigating whether any of the suspects or their families are linked to finance networks used by terror groups. Channel 4 news said last night Osman was one of a group extremists reported to police in 2003 for causing trouble at a mosque in Stockwell, south London. 

 The mosque trustees wrote to the police saying the group had an agenda to turn this centre into another Finsbury park mosque... Problems have now reached a level where police help is urgently needed. Radical clerics advocated holy war in Finsbury Park mosque. 

 3 more charged

 Three more people have been remanded in custody after being charged under terrorism laws in connection with the attempts to bomb Londons transport system on July 21, British police said today.

 The three men were arrested in the southern coastal resort of Brighton last weekend and are accused of failing to disclose information to the police.

 Shadi Sami Abdel Gadir, 22, Omar Nagmeloin Almagboul, 20 and Mohamed Kabashi, 23, appeared before magistrates in London today and were remanded in custody until August 11. Three people, two women and a man, have already been charged with the same offences.

 The charge reads that the men had information that they knew or believed might be of material assistance in securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person in the UK.

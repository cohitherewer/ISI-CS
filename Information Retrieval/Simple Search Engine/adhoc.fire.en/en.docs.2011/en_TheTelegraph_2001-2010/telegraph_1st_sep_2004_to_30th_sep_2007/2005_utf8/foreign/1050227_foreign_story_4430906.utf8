 Musharraf appeal to thwart extremists

 Pervez Musharraf

 Multan, Feb. 26 (Reuters): Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, a key ally in the US-led war on terrorism, urged his nation today to combat Islamic extremists and stop them from misusing mosques and religious schools.

 Speaking to thousands of people at a rally in the central city of Multan, Musharraf said eliminating extremism was vital to turn Pakistan into a prosperous and progressive country.

 ?Those who are using our sacred places like mosques and madarsa to spread extremism and hatred should be stopped,? he said. ?Don?t support them. Stand against them and speak against them.?

 Musharraf has made it mission to fight religious extremism in the country after he sided with the US in the global war on terrorism after the September 11 attacks on US cities in 2001.

 He coined the term ?enlightened moderation? as his philosophy to project Pakistan as a moderate Muslim nation.

 ?Pakistan needs enlightened moderation to be spread among the people at this time. Whoever is trying to take us to extremism, is in fact leading us to disaster,? he said.

 On Thursday, he said Pakistan has broken the back of terrorism, killing and arresting hundreds of militants and destroying the structure of their organisations. Pakistani forces have arrested hundreds of members of Osama bin Ladens al Qaida group and handed many of them to the US over the past three years.

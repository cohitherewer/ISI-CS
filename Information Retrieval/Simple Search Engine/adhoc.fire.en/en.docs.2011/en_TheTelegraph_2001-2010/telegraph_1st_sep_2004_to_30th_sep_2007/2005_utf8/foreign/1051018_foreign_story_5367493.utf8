 In China, church goes underground

 - Family 

 to pay for belief in faith

 The matronly woman reading the Bible to a dozen solemn-looking migrant workers gathered in her tiny living room heads a family of dangerous political provocateurs in the eyes of the Chinese government.

 Her familys crime: believing the state should have no role in how they follow their faith and share it with others.

 Its a belief Cai Laiyi, 62, fears will come at a heavy price. Any day now, authorities here will pass judgment on her son, Cai Zhou Hua, 34, his wife, Xiao Yun Fei, 33, Xiaos brother, Xiao Gao Wen, 37, and his wife, Hu Jin Yun, 43. All were arrested for distributing free Bibles they had printed themselves, and for running an unregistered Protestant church in their neighbourhood.

 He was arrested on September 11 last year, Cai Laiyi said of her son. The significance of this date seemed a bit distant earlier. Now we have our own tragedy but where (the US) attack came from outside, the perpetrators here are those in the government. Democracy and freedom are being destroyed in this country.

 A murmur of consent rises around the room as Cais congregation unloads months of ire against a government whose heavy-handed treatment of independent religious groups has led the US Commission on International Religious Freedoms to list it as a particularly severe violator of religious freedom.

 The party wants us to obey only them, said Cai, who is called Mother by her congregation. They dont want the people to hear the real words of love, of God (for then) they know the people will find something new to believe in.

 There is an old Chinese proverb that says: There cannot be two suns in the sky, which means there can be only one source of power in the land. Its an imperial idea the Communist Party hasnt been shy about following.

 To retain control over religion, particularly faiths with foreign connections such as Islam and Christianity, the Chinese government bans its people from following the established heads of these religions.

 In their place the party has created its own Catholic and Protestant churches, called the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and the Three-Selves Patriotic Movement. Both these churches appoint their own clergy, and are supposed to maintain complete religious and financial independence from the Vatican and foreign Protestant churches.

 That is really a preposterous idea, said Wu Guo Yin, 30, a laundry owner, originally from central Henan province, in Cais Protestant congregation. 

 (The official church) is headed by a communist who doesnt believe in God, yet he feels he can stand at the door between us and our God.

 The reason is that Chinese leaders fear foreign religious groups as a potential threat to national stability and to the partys continued rule. Some who support the policy also suggest that the dictates of foreign churches, such as the Vaticans opposition to abortion, are not appropriate for China.

 Yet, millions of people who feel the Communist Party has forsaken them, continue to search for new sources of meaning and security. And many continue to embrace Christianity ? both official and underground.

 Wiest said there could be as many as eight million underground Catholics in China, and estimates of underground Protestants range from 35 million to more than 100 million ? an increase of about 100 per cent since 1994.

 Chen Rufu, 43, a snack-food stall owner who recently joined Mother Cais group, is one of them. He said he used to be a fervent believer in the Communist Party. Things have changed now, Chen said. My whole family has become believers in Christ and we have all become one big community, loving each other, helping each other. When my wife had an accident last year no one did anything for us, except our church, which helped me take care of my wife and my stall. People in my official church never did that. Wiest said the governments attempt at state-controlled churches is failing.

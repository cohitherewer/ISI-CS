 Fine Print

 Seat bar at Benz

 Berlin, Feb. 7 (Reuters): Mercedes-Benz has agreed to offer ?leather-free? versions of all its luxury cars to pacify an animal rights group that says thousands of cows are slaughtered each year for leather car seats and interiors.

 After complaints from the German chapter of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, DaimlerChrysler said its Mercedes subsidiary will offer fabric or synthetic leather as options. Daimler spokeswoman Ursula Mertzig-Stein said that far from wanting leather-free cars, ?our customers ... are more likely to want even more leather at the premium end. But we?ll make cars without leather on demand.? 

 Fire favour

 Sydney (Reuters): Embarrassed emergency 

 officials are investigating reports a Sydney fire station 

 was unable to respond to an alarm because a fireman had 

 taken the station?s only fire truck to pick up a pizza. 

 Fire officials said on Monday there had been no risk to 

 the public even though the fire station had been unable 

 to respond to a call three weeks ago because the truck was 

 missing. But they confirmed they were probing reports that 

 the fireman had gone to pick up a pizza and then took some 

 friends for a spin in his shiny red truck.

 Christian anger over BBC show

 London, Jan. 7 (Reuters): Christian protesters set fire to their television licences outside the BBC?s London offices today as outrage spread over the public broadcaster?s plans to air a profanity-laden musical.

 In the award-winning London show Jerry Springer ? The Opera, viewers can watch a diaper fetishist confess all to his true love, catch a tap dance routine by the Ku Klux Klan and see Jesus and the Devil locked in a swearing match. Michael Reid, a pastor and self-styled bishop who organised the peaceful demonstration ahead of the airing on Saturday evening, called the musical ?filth?. 

 ?The use of foul language together with mocking Jesus Christ and portraying him wearing a nappy with sequins is highly offensive to Christians and we felt that it was totally wrong,? he said.

 He said the BBC, which is funded by licence fees from the public, would not risk upsetting minority faiths in Britain like Islam or Buddhism.

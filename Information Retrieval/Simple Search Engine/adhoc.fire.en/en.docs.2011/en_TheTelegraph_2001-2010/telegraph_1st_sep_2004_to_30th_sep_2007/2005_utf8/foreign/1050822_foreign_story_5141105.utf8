 Kravitz closes in on Manhattan mansion

 - Tobacco 

 heirs home for singer 

 Lenny Kravitz: Millionaires Row?

 Two eras of extraordinary wealth and celebrity look set to collide on a corner of Fifth Avenue in Manhattan as the rock star Lenny Kravitz negotiates a deal to buy a $50 million eight-storey mansion owned by the Duke family of tobacco barons for more than a century. 

 Kravitz, who launched an architecture and design company earlier this year, has made repeated visits to the Duke Semans Mansion on the corner of Fifth and 82nd Street, the last private house to have its own front door on to the worlds wealthiest street.

 The signs are that Kravitz will keep the 20,000sq ft mansion, built in 1901 as a single family residence, although it would also be the headquarters of his multimillion-dollar music business and new company, Kravitz Design.

 Three potential buyers have so far shown interest in Number 1009 Fifth Avenue, with its commanding view of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and Central Park. 

 The Beaux Arts-style building, which has a Parisian-look pitched roof and elaborate bow windows, has been put on the market by the present head of the Duke family, Mary Duke Biddle Trent Semans, 85. 

 Her family are heirs to the American Tobacco Company, founded in Raleigh, North Carolina, by Benjamin Duke in the 19th century. 

 His grand-daughter Doris, known as the poor little rich girl, was Semanss cousin. The girls used to live and play together in the house during family gatherings in New York.

 Doris Duke died in 1993 at the age of 80, leaving an estimated $1.3 billion to her charitable foundation.

 No matter how much money you have, there will never be another chance to buy a building like this on Fifth Avenue, said Paula Delnunzio, of the estate agent Brown, Harris, Stevens and Co, which is handling the sale. It is unique in so many ways: the last intact family mansion of Millionaires Row. In a city that rebuilds itself every 30 years, this is simply amazing.

 The mansion is the second most expensive residence on the Manhattan market, topped only by the $70-million three-storey penthouse at the Pierre Hotel, also on Fifth Avenue. 

 The agents refuse to discuss Kravitzs interest, admitting only that, to eliminate time-wasters, the bank accounts of any potential buyers are checked before they are offered a tour.

 Kravitzs spokesman in Manhattan, Carlene Donovan, also refused to comment. But Mamdouh Nasr, an ice-cream seller, who has parked his van on the corner for 28 years, offers his own conclusion. 

 I seen this guy Kravitz come in two times myself, for a long time, too, he told the New York Times. Why would he do that if he doesnt want to buy? Hes a busy man!

 Vatican lifts veil on Popes last days

 Vatican City, Sept. 18 (Reuters): In an act of unusual transparency, the Vatican has published a graphically descriptive behind-the-scene account of Pope John Pauls final days, hours and minutes.

 According to a new Vatican volume that chronicles the last two months of his life, the Popes last comprehensible words were Let me go to the house of the Father. He uttered the phrase in Polish in a barely audible voice to aides about three and a half hours before he slipped into a coma and six hours before he died on the evening of April 2.

 It is the first time the Vatican has published such a detailed, insiders account of any popes final days. In the past, there had been much mystery surrounding the deaths of some pontiffs. In 1978, there was much speculation about the death of his immediate predecessor, John Paul I, who died suddenly in his bed after only 33 days in office.

 The Vaticans handling of the information of that death in 1978 was confusing at best, with contradicting official statements about who discovered the body.

 This time, the information is so detailed that parts of it read almost like a patients clinical chart or an aides private diary. The volume of more than 200 pages is a detailed chronicle to be published as a supplement to Acta Apostolicae Sedis, a kind of official gazette of Vatican events.

 Extensive excerpts were published today in Avvenire, the Italian Catholic Churchs official daily newspaper.

 It begins on January 31 when the Vatican announced that the Popes audiences had been suspended because he was suffering from the flu.

 Two days later he was rushed to hospital for the first time with acute breathing problems and throat spasms. His first stay in hospital lasted 10 days but he was rushed back on the morning of February 24 and underwent a tracheotomy to help him breathe.

 The Popes second hospital stay lasted nearly three weeks. The volume is particularly graphic in its description of John Pauls final three days of life, starting on March 31.

 It tells how the ailing Pope, who suffered from Parkinsons disease for the last 10 years of this life, was attending Mass in his chapel when he felt a sudden chill and violent shaking. His temperature quickly rose to nearly 40 degrees. He suffered septic shock caused by an infection of the urinary tract and cardio-circulatory collapse.

 He started slipping in and out of consciousness at about 7:30 am the day he died. He muttered his last comprehensible words at 3:30 pm, entered a coma at 7 pm and died at 9:37 pm.

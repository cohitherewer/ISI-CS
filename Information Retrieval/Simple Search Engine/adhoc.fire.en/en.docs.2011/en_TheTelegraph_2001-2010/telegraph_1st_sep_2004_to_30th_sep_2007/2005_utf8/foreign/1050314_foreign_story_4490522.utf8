 Iran resists American lollipops

 Tehran, March 13 (Reuters): Washington is?hallucinating? if it thinks Iran will scrap its nuclear fuel production plans in return for economic incentives, a senior Iranian official was quoted as saying on Sunday.

 The US offered the encouragements in support of the European Union which is negotiating with Tehran to try to persuade it to give up sensitive nuclear activities.

 US officials are either unaware of the substance of the talks or (they are) ?hallucinating?, Sirus Naseri, a senior member of Iran?s nuclear negotiating team, told the official IRNA news agency.

 Iran says it needs atomic technology to generate electricity and will never use it to make bombs, as the US fears.

 London?s Sunday Times said Israel had drawn up plans for a combined air and ground attack on Iranian nuclear installations if diplomacy fails to halt Tehran?s atomic programme.

 The newspaper said Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and his inner cabinet had given?initial authorisation? for a unilateral attack at a private meeting last month.

 Israel, which bombed Iraq?s Osirak nuclear reactor in 1981, played down the report. Iran has said it will respond vigorously to any attack on its nuclear plants.

 Washington gave practical backing for the EU?s diplomatic approach on Friday, offering to allow Iran to begin talks on joining the World Trade Organisation and consider letting it buy civilian airline parts if it ceased all activities that could produce fuel for nuclear power plants or atomic weapons.

 Washington and the EU have warned Iran it faces referral to the UN Security Council, which could impose economic sanctions, if it fails to allay fears that it wants the bomb.

 Iran dismissed the US offer as insignificant. Intelligence Minister Ali Yunesi told IRNA it was ?funny and disrespectful?. 

 ?The US should apologise to Iran for making this proposal,? he said, going on to describe US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice as a?queen of war and violence?.

 Naseri said it was not clear if greater US involvement in the negotiations was ?helpful or an obstacle to progress?.

 He said the EU, which has persuaded Iran to suspend potentially weapons-related activities like uranium enrichment while the two sides try to reach a solution, was close to accepting that Iran would not give up enrichment.

 Instead, Tehran has offered to give ?objective guarantees? that it will not divert nuclear fuel to military uses.

 ?It seems the Europeans are ready to adopt a logical position,? Naseri said.

 Iran has refused to disclose its guarantees publicly but diplomats and analysts say it is offering to allow intrusive inspections that ensure it only enriches uranium to a low grade which would be unsuitable for weapons.

 It may also be prepared to restrict its enrichment activities to a pilot project, too small to make weapons production practical, diplomats and analysts say.

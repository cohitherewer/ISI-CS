 Saddam aide dead: TV

 Izzat Ibrahim

 Dubai, Nov. 11 (Reuters): Former Iraqi President Saddam Husseins deputy Izzat Ibrahim has died, Al Arabiya satellite television quoted a Baath party statement as saying today.

 Ibrahim was the most senior member of the former regime still at large and had been a top insurgent leader. He is number six on the US militarys list of the 55 most-wanted Iraqis, with a $10 million reward offered for his capture.

 Arabiya gave no further details on how or where he died. There was no confirmation from other sources and one website which publishes regular news releases from Baath party supporters, made no mention of the death..

 Ibrahim was the deputy chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council which Saddam headed. 

 He has been widely rumoured to have cancer and had been very ill while in hiding. 

 Over the past year, US and Iraqi forces have also detained several members of Ibrahims extended family, and claimed at one point to have captured Ibrahim himself, but he remained on the run.

 The dog that floored House

 CHRISTOPHER LEE 

 Washington, Dec. 28: His 

 name was Beau, and he bridged the gap between senator and 

 dog. 

 An accidental activist for the rights of the disabled, Beau, a yellow Labrador retriever, died quietly in his sleep this month, eight years after having an inhuman impact on the question of who may gain entry to the hallowed Senate floor. 

 The 13-year-old guide dogs owner, Moira Shea, reluctantly euthanised him on December 9, ending his suffering from arthritis and breathing problems brought on by old age. 

 One hundred pounds of loyalty and quiet determination in his prime, Beau became a minor celebrity for a couple of days in 1997 when the Senate barred the visually impaired Shea, then a nuclear policy aide to senator Ron Wyden, from bringing the dog onto the Senate floor. 

 An objection had been raised ? anonymously at the time ? by senator Robert C. Byrd, a stickler for procedure. The Senate had no formal rule allowing guide dogs into its chamber. 

 It had, however, voted two years earlier to require Congress to live by the workplace rules it had imposed on other employers. Those include the Americans with Disabilities Act, which guarantees that workers with guide dogs can bring them to the office under most circumstances. 

 It soon became clear that any argument for excluding Beau from the chamber was a dog. 

 Wyden quickly introduced a resolution to allow disabled people to bring supporting services, including dogs, onto the floor. 

 A guide dog is a working dog, not a pet, Wyden said from the Senate floor. .... I had hoped that there would be no need to offer this resolution, but I am forced to because discrimination still persists here. 

 Other senators rallied to the cause. The next day, the Senate passed a resolution by then-Majority Leader Trent Lott opening the door to Beau and setting in motion a rules change permitting service dogs in the chamber. 

 He was a really excellent guide dog, Shea, 50, now a communications manager at the Government Printing Office, said the other day. He was very stoic, very professional, very aloof. He had a charisma. 

 He just had something about 

 him that Ive never seen in another dog.... He developed 

 a following. People react(ed) to him.

 Space tourists: Here are rules

Washington, Feb. 11 (Reuters): Aspiring space 

tourists got some proposed guidelines today from the US government, including 

advice to get a physical exam before travelling and to accept the risks involved 

by signing a form.

 The draft Federal Aviation Administration guidelines also suggest operators of reusable space ships should inform their passengers of the vehicle?s safety record and provide safety training before the launch, transportation secretary Norman Mineta said. ?We?re not going to lose sight of safety,? Mineta said in a speech at his department?s Commercial Space Transportation Conference. ?These guidelines for space tourism respect that this is uncharted territory,? allowing operators ?to determine the best way to meet the standards.?

 There is another set of draft guidelines for space flight crews, Mineta said.

 Pilots of reusable launch vehicles would need to hold an FAA pilot certificate, meet medical standards and be trained to operate their vehicle so it will not harm the public, with emphasis on responding to abort scenarios, emergency operations and procedures that direct the vehicle away from the public in the event of a problem during flight, he said. Mineta said he recognised the early stage of the commercial space flight industry and encouraged feedback on the guidelines.

 The White House unveiled a new policy on commercial space flight in January, seeking to offset the decline in demand for commercial launches by capitalising on interest in public space travel, among other ventures.

 The policy was announced three months after the privately funded SpaceShipOne completed two sub-orbital flights into space with a person aboard, setting a new altitude record and winning a $10 million prize designed to spur commercial space travel. Entrepreneur Richard Bransonhas announced plans to make space travel as ordinary as a Caribbean cruise.

 Shuttle glitch

 Just three months before launching the first space shuttle mission in two years, Nasa is still undecided about which techniques for in-flight repair on the heat shield to test to ensure the Columbia accident is not repeated.

 Garner has a girl

 Garner: Timely birth

 Los Angeles, Dec. 2 (Reuters): Alias star Jennifer Garner has given birth to her first child, a daughter, with actor-husband Ben Affleck, Us Weekly magazine reported yesterday.

 Us Weekly reported on its website that the birth came after doctors induced labour at a Los Angeles hospital on Wednesday night. Affleck, 33, was with his spouse the entire time.

 The couple simultaneously announced their marriage, and Garners pregnancy, in June. The pair were widely reported to have begun dating last year, months after Affleck and former girlfriend Jennifer Lopez called off their engagement.

 Governor killed in Baghdad attack

 Baghdad, Jan. 4 (Reuters): Gunmen killed Baghdad?s governor in Iraq?s highest-profile assassination in eight months and a suicide bomber killed 11 people at a police checkpoint today in an escalating campaign to wreck the January 30 election.

 The shooting of governor Ali al-Haidri in a roadside ambush showed insurgents? power to strike at the heart of the governing class, raising fresh doubts as to whether security forces can protect politicians and voters as the ballot draws near.

 A group led by al Qaida ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, behind most of the bloodiest attacks since the US-led invasion in 2003, claimed responsibility for the assassination, saying its fighters had struck down a ?tyrant and American agent?.

 In a sign that violence could be taking a political toll, Iraq?s President urged the UN to look into whether or not the country should hold the election as scheduled even though other officials have vowed to stick to the timetable.

 Haidri?s assassination took place hours after a bomber rammed a fuel truck into a roadblock near Baghdad?s Green Zone, home to the Iraqi government and the US and British embassies. The vehicle went up in a giant fireball that rocked the capital. The blast killed eight police commandos and three civilians and wounded 60 people, bringing fresh scenes of bloodshed to Baghdad?s streets a day after 17 security men died in a string of ambushes and explosions across the country.

The attacks were the latest in a drive by Sunni insurgents trying to force out US-led forces, cripple the American-backed interim government and scare voters away from the polls. Iraqi leaders say guerrillas also want to provoke sectarian civil war.

 Voicing sadness at Haidri?s assassination, US secretary of state Colin Powell said: ?It once again shows that there are murderers and terrorists and former regime elements in Iraq that don?t want to see an election.

 ?They want to go back to the tyranny of the Saddam Hussein regime and that is not going to happen,? he told a news conference in the southern Thai resort island of Phuket as he began a visit to tsunami-hit countries in Asia.

 Haidri and one of his bodyguards were killed when gunmen opened fire on his car in western Baghdad. He was the most senior official assassinated in the city since the head of the governing council was killed last May.

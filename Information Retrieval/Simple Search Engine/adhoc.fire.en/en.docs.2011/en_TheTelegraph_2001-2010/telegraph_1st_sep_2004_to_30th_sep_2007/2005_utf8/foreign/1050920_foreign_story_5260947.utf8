 Bishop blast

 London, Sept. 19 (Reuters): The West has committed a litany of errors in Iraq and the US-led invasion in 2003 was driven as much by American interest as by concern for the Iraqi people, British church leaders said today.

 In a wide-ranging report, bishops from the Church of England also criticised western policy towards Iran and said the EU had not tried hard enough to end a stand-off over Tehrans nuclear ambitions.

 The bishops said they were worried by the influence of evangelical Christianity ? with its apocalyptic overtones and its very clear political agenda in relation to West Asia ? on US foreign policy.

 The report was commissioned by the House of Bishops, the most senior tier of the Church of Englands hierarchy.

 A rare Anglican foray into international politics, it was produced by a working group headed by one of Britains most senior religious leaders, bishop of Oxford Richard Harries.

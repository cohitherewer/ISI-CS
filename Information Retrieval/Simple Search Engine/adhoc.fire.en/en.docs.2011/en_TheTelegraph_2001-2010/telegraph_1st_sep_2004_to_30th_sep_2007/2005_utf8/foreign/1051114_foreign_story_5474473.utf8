 Foreign baton awaits prince?

 ANDREW ALDERSON

 Queen Elizabeth II: Let him learn

 London, Nov. 13: The queen is to hand over responsibilities for arduous foreign visits and other duties to the Prince of Wales following the success of his tour to the US with the Duchess of Cornwall. 

 According to senior royal officials, the queen is delighted that the eight-day overseas tour went so well and, after her 80th birthday next year, wants to cut back on her most demanding roles. 

 Relations between Buckingham Palace and Clarence House are better than they have been for 20 years and the queen is anxious to develop her eldest sons role as shadow king or king-in-waiting. 

 Moves to give the prince and the duchess the more strenuous overseas visits will be discussed at a meeting before Christmas of the royal visits committee, which is also aware that Prince Philip will be 85 next year. 

 The committee includes senior representatives from Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. 

 Prince Charles, who is 57 tomorrow, is also expected to stand in for the Queen at more investitures, have greater dealings with Tony Blair and other ministers, and be given more access to Government papers. 

 One senior courtier said yesterday: quot;As the Queen gets older, her diary will be assessed accordingly. The prince will take on more duties as part of a natural, carefully managed progression. 

 quot;Relations between Buckingham Palace and Clarence House are terrific at the moment: there is tremendous amount of joined-up thinking. quot; 

 Royal officials say there is no chance of the Queen abdicating and she will continue to perform many of her most important roles including presiding over the state opening of Parliament and attending Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings.

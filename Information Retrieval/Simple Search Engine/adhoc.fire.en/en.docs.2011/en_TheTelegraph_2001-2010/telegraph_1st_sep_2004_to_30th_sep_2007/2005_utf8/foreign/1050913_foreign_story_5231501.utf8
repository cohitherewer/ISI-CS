 Blasphemy arrest in Lahore

 IMTIAZ GUL 

 Islamabad, Sept. 12: Fearing a severe backlash, Pakistani police arrested and sent to jail a Christian man for making derogatory remarks against Prophet Mohammad in Lahore. 

 The remarks from Younis Masih, 40, came during a qawwali function in Chungi Amer Sidhu, which was organised by the Christian community. 

 Christian members present there beat up Masih and asked him to apologise. 

 But Masihs refusal to take back his words sparked indignation among the Muslim residents, who surrounded the police station and demanded registration of a First Investigation Report late on Saturday night, Muhammad Karamat, the duty officer at the police station said. 

 Muslim leaders in the area said they had given repeated assurances of peace to the Christians, saying they only wanted Younis punished. 

 They admitted that some Muslims had damaged Youniss house, but said the damage was minor. 

 Younis was sent to Kot Lakhpat Jail in Lahore after his confession statement before investigation officer Abdul Rasheed late last night. 

 He is expected to be produced before a lower court in Lahore in the next couple of days.

 Mass leave threat from Bangla judges

 Dhaka, Nov. 22 (PTI): Bangladeshi judges have threatened to go on leave en masse if the government failed to look into their security demands after militants killed two of their colleagues earlier this month. 

 The judges have given the government time until December 21 to meet their demands for tax-free weapons and vehicles along with personal gunmen and guards at their homes, media reports here. 

 President of the Bangladesh Judicial Service Association, Mohammad Rafiqul islam, said: Our backs are against the wall. We will not retreat and go for a tougher movement to ensure security for the judges to maintain independence of the judiciary and to realise our demands.

 two judges were killed by the banned militant jamaatul mujaheedin bangladesh (jmb) earlier this month in the worst attack by the group seeking islamic rule in this muslim-majority country.

 Meanwhile, the jmb has again threatened to bury alive law minister moudud ahmed and blow up government offices.

 The government secretariat complex in downtown dhaka has been put under high security alert following such threats and after detectives unearthed that the group was now using its suicide squad. Pti nq dv 11221200 del

 Fine Print

 Keeper goalless

 Brussels, Aug. 22 (Reuters): Belgian womens soccer team SK Berlaar had to stomach a 50-1 defeat against rival KV Mechelen on Saturday because their goalkeeper had opted to attend a music concert instead, a local newspaper said.

 Our keeper went to Pukkel Pop. Thats why, substitute goalkeeper Charlotte Jacobs told Het Laatste Nieuws daily today. KV Mechelen scored their first goal after only four seconds.

 At half-time the score was 27-0. But after half-time we were able to recover. We had to stomach only 23 goals and we scored once ourselves, right at the end. They allowed us to score. That was sweet of them, Jacobs added. 

 Mud mess

 Belgrade (Reuters): Security guards 

 protecting what is left of Serbias once mighty Bor 

 mining and smelting complex are being overrun by thieves 

 stealing mud that contains traces of gold, silver and platinum, 

 a Belgrade newspaper said. Bor police have filed charges 

 against persons unknown for the theft of about 700 kg of 

 valuable anode mud from the bankrupt company in southern 

 Serbia, Danas said in its weekend edition. The thieves 

 stopped at nothing to get at the mud, carrying it off in 

 bags, sacks, bottles, clothing and even in pockets. 

 Japan biz

 Tokyo (Reuters): Spurred by the success of a Cool Biz campaign this summer that encouraged men to dress down to save energy, Japan plans to continue conservation efforts this autumn and winter by promoting Warm Biz fashion. Government workers and politicians have been encouraged to leave off coats and ties between June 1 and September 30 so that air conditioner thermostats can be set higher to help fight global warming. From October 1, however, public sector thermostats will be turned down to 20 Celsius and workers urged to layer up. There are various combinations of dress that we envision, but thermal underwear is definitely going to be crucial, an official at the environment ministry said. 

 Virgin tops

 Los Angeles (Reuters): Female moviegoers 

 fell for the charm of The 40-Year-Old Virgin, starring 

 Steve Carell and Leslie Mann, propelling the comedy to the 

 top of the North American box office in its first weekend 

 of release. Women also accounted for a majority of attendees 

 at the number two film, the suspense movie Red Eye, 

 marking the second consecutive weekend that the top two 

 films appealed to a distaff crowd ? a paradoxical turn given 

 that the studios generally target young males.

 Pope papers not burnt

 RICHARD OWEN

 Rome, June 6: Pope John 

 Paul IIs private secretary defended yesterday his 

 decision to defy the man he served faithfully for 40 years 

 by refusing to burn his personal papers.

 Archbishop Stanislaw Dziwisz, 

 who was at the Popes side from his time as a Polish 

 bishop until his death in April, said that although the 

 late pontiffs will instructed him to burn the papers, 

 he had not done so because they contained great riches.

 The papers would eventually be 

 published, Archbishop Dziwisz said. 

 Last week Pope Benedict XVI appointed 

 him the Archbishop of Krakow, the post John Paul II held 

 as Cardinal Karol Wojtyla before his election as Pope in 

 1978.

 Nothing has been burnt. 

 None of it deserves to be burnt. Everything should be preserved 

 and kept for posterity, for future generations ? every single 

 sentence. These are great riches that should gradually be 

 made available to the public, Archbishop Dziwisz told 

 Polish radio. 

 However, he gave no timetable.

 In his last testament John Paul 

 II said that he was leaving behind no property other than 

 personal effects, to be distributed as is thought 

 fit. 

 He asked Monsignor Dziwisz, however, 

 to supervise the burning of all my personal notes.

 Vatican sources said that Monsignor 

 Dziwisz had told friends that he fully realised that he 

 was defying the wishes of the man he had served with such 

 discretion and loyalty. But he believed that his duty to 

 the memory of John Paul II overrode the papal instruction. 

 He also believed that the material 

 left behind will be useful to the Congregation for 

 the Causes of Saints as it considers the case for the beatification 

 of the late Pope, sources said.

 Last month Pope Benedict XVI put 

 his predecessor on the fast track to sainthood by waiving 

 the five-year waiting period before the process of beatification 

 ? the last step before canonisation ? can begin. 

 Monsignor Dziwisz said that he 

 had also kept his own daily notes throughout John Pauls 

 papacy, and these could also prove useful in the canonisation.

 There is a precedent for Archbishop 

 Dziwiszs action. Andrea Tornielli, a papal biographer 

 and writer on Vatican affairs, said that Paul VI was also 

 ignored when he asked Monsignor Pasquale Macchi, his secretary, 

 to burn his papers after his death.

 The papers were instead conserved 

 and are kept at the Paul VI Institute in Brescia.

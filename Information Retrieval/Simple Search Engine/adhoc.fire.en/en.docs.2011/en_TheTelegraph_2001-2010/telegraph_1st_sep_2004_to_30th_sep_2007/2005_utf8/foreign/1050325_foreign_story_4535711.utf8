 14 killed in Texas oil plant blast

Texas City (Texas), March 24 (Reuters): Fourteen 

people died and about 100 were injured, some seriously, yesterday by a powerful 

explosion at a BP oil refinery in Texas.

 BP said it could not immediately pinpoint the cause of the blast at the giant 470,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) Texas City facility. But it has ruled out terrorism.

 ?We have no reason to believe this was anything caused by an outside agent,? said company spokesman Hugh Depland. ?We believe 14 people lost their lives as a result of the fire,? said BP site director Don Parus.

 The explosion comes just a year after another blast rocked the same refinery. On March 30, 2004, a large explosion and fire occurred in a fuel-making unit but there were no injuries.

 That accident resulted in citations for 14 alleged violations from the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration. OSHA immediately began an investigation into the latest incident, BP, headquartered in London, said. Company officials said of the 100 hurt in the accident, some were in critical condition.

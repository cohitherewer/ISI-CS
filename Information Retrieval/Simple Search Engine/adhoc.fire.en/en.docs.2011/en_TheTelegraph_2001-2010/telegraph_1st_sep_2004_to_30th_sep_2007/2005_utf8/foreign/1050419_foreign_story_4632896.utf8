 Tories tear into Labour campaign blunder

 London, April 18 (Reuters): Britain?s Opposition Conservative Party, gunning for Tony Blair at a May 5 election, gleefully pounced today on an embarrassing slip in a campaign document to accuse him of shame-faced deception.

 In a leaflet on health, the Labour party said it decided to hike National Insurance payroll tax ?in 1998? ? three years before the last election.

 The date contradicts Labour?s long-standing assertion that the decision was made after the 2001 election, reigniting a row over its promise in that campaign not to raise taxes.

 Red-faced Labour officials called it a printing error but the Conservatives said it confirmed Blair had deceived voters.

 ?At last, after years of evasion, we have the truth in Labour?s own words. Despite Mr Blair?s repeated attempts to mislead voters about his plans, we now know that he had a secret tax-raising agenda all along,? said George Osborne, the Conservatives? treasury spokesman.

 ?This extraordinary slip reveals the true extent to which he is prepared to deceive the British public,? added Osborne. The Conservatives say Blair will raise taxes after May 5 if it wins and its key message is that the Prime Minister cannot be trusted. Labour accused the Conservatives of ?desperate stuff?.

 ?This is obviously just a typographical error,? said a Labour spokesperson, repeating the assertion that the hike came in response to a March 2002 report on health service funding. The National Insurance hike sparked outrage, coming on the back of Labour?s pledge not to raise taxes before the poll.

 Labour argues National Insurance is not a tax and has refused to rule out increasing it if it wins again this time.

 ?The question now is what nasty surprises he has lined up for us if he wins a third term,? said Osborne.

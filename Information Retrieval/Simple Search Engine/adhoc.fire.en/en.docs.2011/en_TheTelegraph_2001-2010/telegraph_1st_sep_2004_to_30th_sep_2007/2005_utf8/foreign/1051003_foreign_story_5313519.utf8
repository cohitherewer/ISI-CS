 Bush battles Katrina blow to credibility

 Bush: Tough time

 Washington, Oct. 2 (Reuters): President George W. Bush is battling to climb out of a slump caused by the slow federal response to Hurricane Katrina, the Iraq war and soaring gasoline prices, events that have all combined to damage his credibility and deflate Americans confidence in him.

 The strategy for getting his groove back, aides say, is to narrow his focus and tackle head-on those three top priorities ? hurricane recovery, Iraq and energy ? and set aside for now other items like social security and tax reform that he had expected to spend the autumn on.

 But all three priorities carry their own risks and challenges, with the cost of rebuilding New Orleans straining the US budget and causing consternation among conservatives, American casualties rising in Iraq and gas prices showing no signs of dropping to pre-hurricane levels.

 The strategy, said a senior administration official, is to stay focused on what were trying to accomplish and recognise that some of that is going to take some time to change.

 Doing his job has always been his strongest suit, said one adviser close to the White House. Let Bush be Bush. Let him lead. Its what Bush does in times like these.

 Other threatening clouds are on the horizon. White House officials are braced for the possibility of bad news from a probe that could be nearing completion soon into the illegal leak of a CIA agents name.

 In addition the indictment of Texas Republican Tom DeLay threatens to complicate the Republican agenda heading into the 2006 mid-term election campaign season. 

 Between the arrogance, the indictments and the general culture of corruption, its really hard to decide where to begin. Republicans have no strategy and no plan. America can do better, said Rebecca Kirszner, spokeswoman for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat.

 This week, after a month dominated by hurricanes, Bush and top administration officials will seek to rebuild Americans confidence in the Iraq war.

 Vice-President Dick Cheney will have lunch with troops tomorrow at Camp LeJeune, North Carolina, and give a speech.

 Iran entry

 Geneva, May 26 (Reuters): The WTO agreed today to start membership negotiations with Iran after the US dropped a long-standing veto.

 The US decision appeared to be the first tangible reward for Iran after it agreed yesterday to maintain its suspension of all nuclear activities in a deal with the EU. Mohammad Reza Alborzi, Irans ambassador to the UN in Geneva, welcomed the breakthrough at WTOs general council, whose 148 member states take decisions by consensus. I take note that a decision that has long been overdue has been now established, Alborzi said in remarks to the closed-door meeting.

 Iran applied to join the WTO in September 1996 and its candidacy was first considered in May 2001. But Washington had blocked agreement ever since at 22 general council meetings. Today this house with this decision has done service to itself by correcting a wrong, Alborzi said.

 Carlo Trojan, the EUs trade ambassador, welcomed the decision as positive news. Joseph Akerman, a trade envoy from member Israel, said if Iran fulfils the basic principles of the WTO, then they are welcome like any other country.

 Islamabad, Oct. 6 (Reuters): After violence and killings in earlier rounds, the final phase of Pakistans local elections passed off largely peacefully today as thousands of newly elected councillors voted for powerful district chiefs.

 Some unofficial results were expected within hours of the close of polls, and most should be known by Saturday.

 While political parties were barred from contesting, candidates did little to hide their loyalties and victory for the ruling Pakistan Muslim League and its allies is widely anticipated.

 The 110 district chiefs, known as nazims, will play a crucial role in building power bases ahead of a general election due in 2007 that could decide President Pervez Musharrafs future.

 Paramilitary forces were deployed in constituencies regarded as highly sensitive, and with one notable exception there were few reports of violence. Six policemen were wounded in a clash between rival supporters in Sindh.

 Jakarta, March 3 (Reuters): An Indonesian court sentenced fiery Muslim preacher Abu Bakar Bashir to two-and-a-half years in jail today after finding him guilty of an ?evil conspiracy? to commit the 2002 Bali nightclub bombings.

 The US and Australia ? which have both accused Bashir of being the spiritual leader of an al Qaida linked militant network called Jemaah Islamiah ? quickly expressed disappointment that the sentence was not more severe.

 A panel of judges said although Bashir had not been directly involved in the Bali blasts, he had in their opinion given approval for the attack, which killed 202 people.

 Hundreds of Bashir?s supporters outside the court reacted with outrage to the verdict, shouting and raising their fists in the air. The court, however, found the cleric not guilty of involvement in the bombing of the J.W. Marriott Hotel in Jakarta.

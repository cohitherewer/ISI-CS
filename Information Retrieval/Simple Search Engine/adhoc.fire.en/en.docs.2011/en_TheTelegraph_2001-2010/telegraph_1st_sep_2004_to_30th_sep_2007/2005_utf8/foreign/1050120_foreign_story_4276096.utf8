 Firms foot bash bill

 Washington, Jan. 19 (Reuters): American companies with deep pockets and an even deeper interest in what goes on in Washington are footing most of the expected $40 million bill for President George W. Bush?s inaugural bash.

 Security costs aside, the President has said no taxpayer money will be involved in financing the lavish festivities celebrating his second inauguration this week, including a parade, candlelight dinners and nine inaugural balls.

 Instead, the financial services industry, energy companies, automakers, drug giants, tobacco companies and wealthy individuals are picking up the tab, and getting a chance to rub shoulders with the politically powerful. Major donors have contributed $24.9 million already, according to the Presidential Inaugural Committee, which lists them on its website at www.inaugural05.com. Many giving to the inaugural celebrations have big issues on the boil in Washington, ranging from whether a portion of Social Security retirement contributions are privatised to renewed efforts to pass an energy bill that may open new areas to oil exploration.

 Many givers also saw their executives and employees contributing to the Bush re-election campaign, and say this spending is as normal as voting in a democracy. While laws govern what individuals can give to a campaign, there are no limits on inaugural gifts from individuals or corporations, other than those imposed by the Presidential Inaugural Committee itself. ?Political participation by companies and associations in the US is a normal course of business,? said Lauren Kerr, media advisor at Exxon Mobil Corp, when asked why the company had given $250,000 ? the top amount the committee accepts. 

 Some companies acknowledge that financing parties is a good way to join the festivities and gain access to a broad range of US policymakers who will be there.

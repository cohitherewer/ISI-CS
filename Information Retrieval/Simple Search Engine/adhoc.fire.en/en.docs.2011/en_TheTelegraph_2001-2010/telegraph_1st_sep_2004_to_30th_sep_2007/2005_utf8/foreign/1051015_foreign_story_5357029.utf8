 Pillow for peace

 Copenhagen, Oct. 14 (Reuters): A pillow that plays relaxing music has been sent by the Danish army to its soldiers posted in Iraq and Kosovo to help them combat stress and tension.

 In a first test, we have sent 10 pillows each to Iraq and Kosovo and they are now being used by the troops, Henrik Lundstein, head of the leadership and psychology department at Denmarks Royal Defence College, said. 

 The pillow has built-in speakers attached to an MP3-player piping soft instrumentals and sounds of nature like trickling water and chirping birds. 

 Toxic leeks

 Brussels (Reuters): Belgian police warned 

 thieves on Friday who made off with leeks from a vegetable 

 farm: dont eat them ? they could be toxic. The robbers 

 stole 200 kg of leeks, a main ingredient of Vichyssoise 

 soup, but police said the vegetables should have stayed 

 in the ground another six weeks to be safe after treatment 

 with pesticides. Consumers were told to beware of leeks 

 with a strange smell.

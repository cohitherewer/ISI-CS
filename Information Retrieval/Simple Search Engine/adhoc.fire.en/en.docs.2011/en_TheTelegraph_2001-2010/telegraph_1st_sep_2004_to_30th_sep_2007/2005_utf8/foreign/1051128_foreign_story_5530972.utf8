 Pieer Chanasi, Pakistan, Nov. 27 (Reuters): Pakistans earthquake zone got its first harsh winter weather today, with rain and snow bringing relief operations to a halt and gloom to survivors.

 Up to 8 inches of snow fell in some high-altitude areas and up to 1.2 inches of rain drenched some lower areas, the meteorological department said.

 Flights are off for today, said a spokesman for the UN World Food Programme in Muzaffarabad. An International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) official said their air and road operations had also been called off.

 A race against time is on to ensure hundreds of thousands of homeless survivors are given adequate shelter and enough food to see them through a bitter winter.

 If not, disease could sweep through cold, poorly nourished survivors, causing a second wave of death, aid officials say.

 Snow was falling in the village of Pieer Chanasi this afternoon and residents were grim. Were in trouble. Our children and animals are also in trouble, said Tanvir Naqvi. The temperature is dropping and a tent is not enough.

 Fresh landslides, apparently triggered by the rain, disrupted traffic on the road up to the village, which was under about 2 inches of snow.

 The authorities hope people in high-altitude settlements will come down to tent camps on valley floors for the winter, but most people have chosen to stick it out at their ruined homes.

 Aid officials are making plans in case bad weather sends a flood of people down into unsanitary and over-crowded tent camps in Muzaffarabad and other towns.

 The ICRC official said good weather up to now meant aid deliveries were slightly ahead of schedule, but prolonged bad weather would be a worry.

 A weather official said 8 inches of snow had fallen in the Naran area and 7 inches in the Kaghan Valley, both in North West Frontier Province. The temperature in Muzaffarabad dropped to a low of four degrees Celsius last night.

 Focus on Moroccan

 London, July 9: Security forces across Europe have been asked to intensify their search for a religious scholar given asylum in Britain who is suspected of planning a series of terrorist atrocities. 

 Scotland Yard was careful yesterday about not suggesting that Mohamed Guerbouzi, a 44-year-old Moroccan, is the probable mastermind of the London attacks but, among the dozens of militants they are scrutinising, his is the first name to have emerged. 

 He had been living in Britain since 1974 but disappeared days after the attacks on Madrid commuter trains in 2004. Last night Guerbouzis family said: He denies having any links to the terror cell responsible for the Tube bombings. One of his daughters, who refused to give her name, said that he is in hiding somewhere in Britain. 

 She said that he was on the run because of harassment from British police and security officials in Europe. 

 Guerbouzi was already wanted by French and Moroccan authorities before the Madrid attacks for his alleged links to various terrorist cells abroad. 

 A Brussels-based police official revealed yesterday that after the Tube bombings the authorities made an urgent plea to their European counterparts to track him down in relation to the attacks on London. 

 If a link is found between Guerbouzi and the bombers, it could suggest that senior al Qaida figures were involved. Guerbouzi was reportedly chosen by Osama bin Laden to orchestrate suicide attacks on clubs and hotels in Casablanca in 2003 when 44 were killed. He is alleged to have met Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian militant who has killed foreign hostages in Iraq. 

 The Moroccan authorities passed a 20-year jail sentence on him in his absence. He is alleged to have chaired a terror summit in Istanbul in 2003 to finalise plans for the Casablanca attacks. The Moroccan authorities claim that Guerbouzi handed over ?45,000 in cash to couriers from the Casablanca bombers.

 Voice of Taliban held in Pak

 Islamabad, Oct. 4 (Reuters): The main spokesman for Afghanistans Taliban insurgents, Abdul Latif Hakimi, was arrested in Pakistan today, the Pakistani government said.

 He was arrested a few hours ago. Intelligence agencies worked on a tip-off. More details will come later, interior minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao said. 

 Hakimi has been the main spokesman for the Taliban, who were ousted by US-led forces in 2001.

 He was frequently in touch with reporters, speaking by satellite telephone from an undisclosed location, although Afghan and US officials have long suspected he was in Pakistan.

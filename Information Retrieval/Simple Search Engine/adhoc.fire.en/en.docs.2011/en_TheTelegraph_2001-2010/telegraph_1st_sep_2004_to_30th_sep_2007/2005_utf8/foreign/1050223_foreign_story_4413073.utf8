 Shias propose PM 

 Ibrahim al-Jaafari

 Baghdad, Feb. 22 (Reuters): Iraq?s main Shia alliance named Ibrahim al-Jaafari as its candidate for Prime Minister today, meaning he will almost certainly get the job following the alliance?s success in last month?s historic election.

 Jaafari, a religious Shia and head of the Islamist Dawa Party, had faced competition from inside the alliance from former exile Ahmad Chalabi, once favoured by the Pentagon. But alliance sources said that Chalabi withdrew his candidature at a meeting in Baghdad, and the alliance?s 140 members unanimously approved Jaafari.

 The bald, grey-bearded 58-year-old still faces a challenge from incumbent interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi.

 But Allawi?s list won only 14 per cent of the vote in last month?s election, weakening his hand, while the Shia alliance won 48 per cent ? enough for a majority in the National Assembly ? and has insisted on having the Prime Minister?s job.

 Jaafari is a soft-spoken diplomat who was a member of the US-appointed Governing Council that ran Iraq after the 2003 war. 

 He joined Dawa ? Iraq?s oldest Islamic movement ? in 1966, but was forced to flee to Iran in 1980 after a crackdown on the party in which thousands of his comrades were killed. He is a physician and father of five, and his family lives in London.

 Insurgents reminded the future government of the challenges it will face by detonating a car bomb near an Iraqi army convoy as it left Baghdads fortified Green Zone. Two soldiers were killed and 30 wounded by the blast, which sprayed shrapnel over a wide area and could be heard across the city.

 The human rights group Amnesty International also gave Iraq?s future leaders food for thought, publishing a report which said Iraqi women were no better off now than under Saddam Hussein.

 The report, entitled: Iraq ? Decades of Suffering, accused some US soldiers of abusing Iraqi women.

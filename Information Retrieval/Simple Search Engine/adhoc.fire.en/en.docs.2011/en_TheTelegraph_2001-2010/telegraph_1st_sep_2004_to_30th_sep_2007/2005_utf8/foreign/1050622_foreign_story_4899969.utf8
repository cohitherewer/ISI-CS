 Nepal radio silences censors

 Kathmandu, June 21 (Reuters): Banned from broadcasting news since Februarys royal coup, Nepali radio reporters have found a new way to get their bulletins out: loudspeaker.

 Every evening, about 300 people gather on a roadside in Biratnagar, 500 km east of Kathmandu to listen to Keshav Bhattarai read out the news from an open air studio on the roof of a narrow, three-storeyed building.

 As well as spreading the news, the service stands for a free media, Bhattarai tells his audience, a motley collection of politicians, teachers, students, traders and anyone who just happens to be passing.

 Nepals dozens of independent FM stations ? wildly popular as the only alternative on the air to state radios staid and vetted bulletins ? were banned from broadcasting news when King Gyanendra fired the government and imposed strict censorship on February 1.

 Some restrictions have been eased, but the FM stations still cannot broadcast even censored news.

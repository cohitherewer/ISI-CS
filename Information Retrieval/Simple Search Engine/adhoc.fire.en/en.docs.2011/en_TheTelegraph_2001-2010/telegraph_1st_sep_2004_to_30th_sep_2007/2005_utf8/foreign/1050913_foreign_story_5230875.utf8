 Koizumi swansong in triumph

 Tokyo, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said today that he still planned to step down next year despite his partys landslide election win, raising the question of who would succeed one of the most popular leaders in Japans history.

 Some members of the ruling coalition said Koizumi should stay on after his term as president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) ends in September 2006 to turn his popularity into votes for the Upper House election due in the summer of 2007.

 But Koizumi ruled out such a possibility, saying there were many LDP lawmakers keen to succeed him.

 I have said I have no intention of staying on as party president and Prime Minister (beyond September 2006), and there is no change to that, he told a news conference.

 There are a lot of people interested ... I want them to start preparing from now.

 The LDP won 296 of the 480 seats in Parliaments Lower House, taking a majority in the chamber for the first time in 15 years.

 Asked to characterise his successor, Koizumi said: I am pinning my hopes on those who would take the reforms forward.

 Given that Sundays election victory demonstrated popular support for Koizumis plan to privatise Japans postal system, the core of his reform agenda, analysts said his successor would also have to be a reformer.

 While most of those seen as potential candidates fit the reformer image, their views on diplomacy differ, and Japans relations, especially with its Asian neighbours, could be affected variously depending on who takes the reins from Koizumi.

 Relations with Beijing and Seoul have deteriorated under Koizumi, largely due to his annual visits to Tokyos Yasukuni shrine, seen by many as a symbol of Japanese militarism before and during World War II.

 Pak Sunni radical held

 - Shia-raid slur on militant

 Asif Choto: Notorious

 Islamabad, Sept. 28 (Reuters): Pakistani security forces have arrested a notorious Sunni militant accused of involvement in a series of attacks on minority Shias, intelligence officials said today.

 The man, Asif Choto, was arrested several days ago with another suspected militant in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, adjoining Islamabad, the officials said. He is a major wanted militant, said one intelligence official who declined to be identified.

 Interior minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao declined to comment.

 Another intelligence official said Choto masterminded a suicide attack on a Shia mosque in the eastern city of Sialkot in October in which at least 25 people were killed. Security forces acting on information provided by Choto had arrested up to seven other militants in different parts of the central Punjab province, the second official said.

 A police investigator said Choto was wanted in connection with dozens of criminal cases in Karachi and the government of the southern province of Sindh had announced a reward of 2.5 million rupees ($42,000) for his capture.

 Choto is a member of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, an outlawed Sunni militant group blamed for most of the attacks on Shias, which is also believed to have links with al Qaida. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi has also been implicated in attacks on western targets in Pakistan including the murder of US reporter Daniel Pearl in 2002, and in two attempts to kill President Pervez Musharraf.

 It was not clear if Choto was involved in those incidents, the security officials said. While most members of Pakistans Sunni majority live in peace with Shias, militants from both sects have been responsible for attacks in which hundreds of people have been killed in recent years.

 Syria spits fire at UN resolution

 Damascus, Nov. 1 (Reuters): Syria today sharply criticised a UN resolution ordering it to cooperate fully with an international inquiry into the killing of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri or face unspecified action.

 We consider the resolution to be very negative towards Syria and as it is unanimous this makes it more problematic, a foreign ministry source said of Mondays Security Council vote.

 It is accusatory and adopts the assumptions that (chief UN investigator Detlev) Mehlis had arrived at which we consider hasty and not objective enough, the source said.

 Mehlis, the German prosecutor conducting the inquiry, has already pointed to Syrian security officials as suspects in the February 14 Beirut bombing that killed Hariri and 22 others.

 His October 20 report spoke of converging evidence of Syrian and Lebanese involvement in Hariris killing and said it would be hard to imagine how such a plot could have gone ahead without the knowledge of Syrian and Lebanese intelligence services.

 Tightening the diplomatic noose around Syria, US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice told the council that the resolution made it clear that failure to comply with these demands will lead to serious consequences from the international community.

 But unanimity was achieved only after the US, France and Britain, sponsors of the resolution, agreed to drop an explicit threat of economic sanctions against Syria. Otherwise Russia, China and Algeria might have abstained.

 Instead, the resolution says the council could consider further action if Syria fails to meet demands that include detaining anyone whom Mehlis wants to question.

 Russia today said it had spared Damascus the threat of sanctions and of being linked, without proof, with terrorist activities. It said the resolution opened the way for broad and effective dialogue of the Syrian side with international investigators.

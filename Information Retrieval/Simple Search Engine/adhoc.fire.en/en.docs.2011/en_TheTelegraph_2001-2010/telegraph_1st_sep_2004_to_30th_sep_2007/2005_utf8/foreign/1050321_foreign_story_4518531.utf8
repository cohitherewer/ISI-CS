 Japan quake

 Tokyo, March 20 (Reuters): A powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.0 hit Japan?s southernmost main island of Kyushu on Sunday, killing an elderly woman, injuring 400, and forcing hundreds to flee their homes, officials and media reports said.

 The meteorological agency issued tsunami warnings, but the advisories were lifted about an hour later. Authorities, however, warned that aftershocks with magnitude of up to 6 were possible.

 Snowballing Rita targets Texas

 Miami, Sept. 21 (Reuters): After lashing the Florida Keys, Hurricane Rita was upgraded on Wednesday into a more powerful Category 4 storm as it headed across the Gulf of Mexico on a course that could take it to Texas and dump more rain on Katrina-battered Louisiana.

 Ritas winds increased to 193-kmph winds as it headed into the Gulf. The storm hit the Florida Keys but did not get close enough to reach the vulnerable chain of islands with its most destructive forces.

 The upgrade put Rita in the same strength classification as Hurricane Katrina, which devastated parts of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama last month, and it sparked concern in financial markets that the new storm could wreak as much damage as Katrinas assault on the US Gulf Coast last month.

 US crude-oil prices rose and the dollar weakened against the euro. US stock futures also pointed to a lower market open.

 Ritas most likely future track would take it to Texas by the end of the week, raising fears the sprawling storm could bring heavy rains to flooded New Orleans and threaten the recovery of oil production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico.

 With grim news footage of Katrinas assault still fresh in their minds, officials along the Texas Gulf Coast prepared for Rita. 

 An evacuation was ordered for Galveston and several schools in the region planned to cancel classes.

 About 1,100 Hurricane Katrina evacuees still in Houstons two mass shelters faced another evacuation as the city found itself in Ritas possible path. They were being sent to Fort Chaffee, Arkansas.

 Ritas centre was about 313 km west of Key West, Florida, at 1200 GMT. The hurricane was headed west into the southeastern Gulf of Mexico at about 22 kmph, the US National Hurricane Center said.

 The centre said Rita became a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale ? with sustained winds above 217 kmph this morning.

 The conditions over the central Gulf are much like they were for Katrina, hurricane centre deputy director Ed Rappaport told CNN. A major hurricane could send a 6-metre storm surge over the Texas coast by Saturday.

 Oil companies just starting to recover from Katrina evacuated Gulf oil rigs as Rita moved toward major energy production areas.

 The navy began moving its remaining fleet of Katrina relief vessels, including the Iwo Jima, away from the Gulf Coast to ride out any potential battering from Rita.

 US light crude oil rose $1.80 per barrel to $68, its highest level in three weeks. The dollar lost 1 per cent against the euro and Swiss franc.

 President George W. Bush was briefed yesterday on the growing storm aboard the helicopter assault landing ship Iwo Jima, which is docked in New Orleans.

 Bush, who was criticised as being caught off guard by the severity of Katrina, said he had sent an admiral to Texas to coordinate any needed response to Rita. Residents of the Florida Keys were grateful that Rita merely skirted their area.

 We did not have the flooding I thought wed have, Key West mayor Jimmy Weekley told reporters. We were extremely lucky.

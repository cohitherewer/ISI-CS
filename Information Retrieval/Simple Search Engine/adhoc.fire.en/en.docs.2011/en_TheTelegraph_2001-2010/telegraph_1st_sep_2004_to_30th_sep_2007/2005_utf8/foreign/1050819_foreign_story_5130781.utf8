 Police tried to stop UK probe

 London, Aug. 18 (Reuters): Londons police chief initially tried to block an inquiry by the forces independent watchdog into the police shooting of a Brazilian they mistakenly thought was a suicide bomber, the supervisory body said today.

 Police shot electrician Jean Charles de Menezes eight times on an underground train on July 22, the day after four attacks on Londons transport system failed when bombs did not explode. Two weeks earlier four suicide bombers had killed 52 commuters.

 The Metropolitan Police Service initially resisted us taking on the investigation but we overcame that, John Wadham, deputy chair of the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), said in a strongly worded statement.

 This dispute has caused delay in us taking over the investigation but we have worked hard to recover the lost ground, he said.

 The watchdogs statement will heap further pressure on London police chief Ian Blair, who first said the shooting was linked to the investigation into the failed bombings and that de Menezes was challenged and refused to obey police orders.

 Blair told Londons Evening Standard newspaper his men had been convinced they were dealing with a suicide bomber and that there had been no attempt to cover up events. 

 Lawyers representing de Menezes family accused Blair of trying to block an official inquiry, saying he asked the government for an internal police investigation into the killing rather than hand over the probe to the IPCC.

 Messaging risky for children

 SARAH WOMACK

 London, Aug. 23: Children who regularly send text messages to their friends on mobile telephones are at risk of developing repetitive strain injury, health experts have warned. 

 Regular texting using just a thumb to type could cause pain and swelling in the tendons and possibly long-term injury, said the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists.

 As mobile phones get smaller and more children acquire them, they are at risk of a condition more often linked to desk-bound adults. 

 Bronwyn Clifford, of the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Occupational Health and Ergonomics, said: The thumb is not a very dexterous digit. It is good at grasping but not good for repetitive movement.

 RSI symptoms include tingling, numbness, weakness, loss of movement, muscle spasm and shooting pains.

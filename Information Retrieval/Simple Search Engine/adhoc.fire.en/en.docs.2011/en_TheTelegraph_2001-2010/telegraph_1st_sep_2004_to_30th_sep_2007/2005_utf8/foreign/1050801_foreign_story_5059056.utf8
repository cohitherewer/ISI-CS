 Persistent amp; patient probe into plot

 Rome, July 31: The rooms are ordinary, the drama inside them, extraordinary. The sparsely furnished eight-feet square spaces in the basement of Paddington Green, Britains highest-security police station, are where some of the suspected bombers arrested last week are coming face to face with their questioners.

 The suspects are being kept in separate cells in the police stations anti-terrorist unit and then taken each day to be interviewed in one of the small, sound-proofed, windowless rooms just along the corridor. Each suspect sits at a table in the middle, next to his solicitor and opposite two police officers trained in the art of eliciting information from those suspected of committing serious crimes.

 Every minute of the interviews are recorded on a tape recorder and, almost certainly, on video, the camera mounted on a tripod behind the police officers.

 The original recordings of the interviews, the master copies, are kept by police and a working copy is given to the suspects solicitor if he is charged. The interviewing officers give only their badge number, not their names or ranks, to the suspect and his lawyer.

 The anti-terrorist area, described as relatively comfortable compared with the stations ordinary cells, is mothballed when there are no terrorists suspects to be interviewed. The unit is completely separate from the rest of the station. Each suspect is kept in his own cell and apart from the others at all times.

 The suspects can be held for up to 14 days for questioning. One of them, Yasin Hassan Omar, who was arrested in Birmingham on Wednesday on suspicion of being the Warren Street bomber, has already faced three days of interviews.

 One senior officer said that progress had been slow and declined to comment on reports that Omar, 24, a Somalian who came to Britain when he was 11, had helped lead police to the other suspects. He is understood to have complained of nausea and headaches caused, he says, by the 50,000-volt Taser stun gun used on him when he was arrested.

 By contrast, however, Hussain Osman, also known as Hamdi Isaac, the suspected Shepherds Bush bomber arrested in Italy, was very talkative when questioned by Italian investigators in Rome, but his statements were said to be contradictory, according to Italian police officials. 

 The interviewing techniques used on the suspects would not be of the good cop, bad cop kind beloved of writers of police dramas and there would be none of the roughing-up or psychological torture reportedly used on terror suspects in the 1970s.

 Theres no point shouting or leaning across the table towards him, the stations senior officer said. His lawyer is sitting there with him and the whole thing is on video, so it would look a bit stupid when its shown at the Old Bailey two years down the line. 

 Instead the approach will be what one anti-terrorist officer described as forceful, persistent and patient but not aggressive. The interviewing officers tell each suspect that he could face very serious charges and give him some details of the evidence against him, under the practice known as limited disclosure.

 Officers hope that the suspects will give them information that will lead them to the masterminds behind the terror attacks. We want to find out who organised these attacks, who made the bombs, who were their contacts in Britain or abroad and how many more terrorists there are in this country, an anti-terrorist officer said.

 The first part of the interviews are used to get the suspect to answer simple questions about their movements. 

 He will be allowed to talk, to say what he likes, the senior officer said. We want the suspects to talk as much as possible, even if they tell lies.

 The alleged bombers have the right to remain silent but would have been told that this could count against them in court.

 The next round of interviews are used to challenge any lies, discrepancies or inconsistencies in the suspects answers. Officers may present them with evidence such as closed-circuit television images, fingerprints or traces of explosives.

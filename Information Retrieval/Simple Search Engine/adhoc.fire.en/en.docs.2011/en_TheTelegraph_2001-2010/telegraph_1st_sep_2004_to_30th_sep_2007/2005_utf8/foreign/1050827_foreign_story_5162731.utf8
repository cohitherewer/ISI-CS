 Aniston trespasser held after break-in

 Jennifer Aniston

 Malibu (California), Aug. 26 (AP): A man who allegedly walked into Jennifer Anistons home and said he was looking for the actor was arrested for trespassing, the Los Angeles county sheriffs department reported.

 David Hesterbey, 48, of Santa Barbara, was arrested by sheriffs deputies who found him walking along the beach near Anistons home around noon yesterday. He remained in jail last night in lieu of a $500 bail, the sheriffs department reported.

 Sergeant Ken Scheurn said two of Anistons employees told deputies a man walked into the actors home on the Pacific coast highway and told one of them he was looking for Jennifer.

 When the second employee confronted the man, he became startled and fled the house, jumping a fence and running toward the beach, the sheriffs department said.

 Deputies found Hesterbey on the beach a short time later, and the employees identified him as the intruder, the police said. He was believed to have entered the home through an unlocked door, authorities said.

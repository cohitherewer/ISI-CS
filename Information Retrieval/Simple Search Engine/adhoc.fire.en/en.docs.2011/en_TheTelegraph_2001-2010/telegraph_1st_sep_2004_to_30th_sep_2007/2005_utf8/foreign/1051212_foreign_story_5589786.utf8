 China confirms lethal action on protesters

 Beijing, Dec. 11 (Reuters): China has confirmed that police shot dead three protesters in alarm during an attack last week on a wind power plant, and a newspaper today said the official who ordered the shooting had been detained.

 Human rights group Amnesty International said it was the first time Chinese police had fired on protesters since the crushing of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy demonstrations in 1989.

 Estimates from residents and rights groups put the number of dead between two and as many as 20.

 Villagers said riot police opened fire on Tuesday on protesters at Dongzhoukeng village in southern Guangdong after they moved in to quell demonstrations over lack of compensation for land lost to the wind power plant.

 The official Xinhua news agency said in an overnight report that villagers in Dongzhoukeng and Shigongliao attacked the plant on Monday and Tuesday last week.

 The first assault on December 5 caused a seven-hour suspension of the plants power generation, Xinhua said. In the second onslaught, over 170 armed villagers led by instigators... used knives, steel spears, sticks, dynamite powder, bottles filled with petroleum, and fishing detonators.

 Police used tear gas to break up the protesters and arrested two, it said. 

 (One of the villagers) shouted through a loudspeaker that they would throw detonators at the police and blow up the wind power plant if the police refused to retreat. 

 It became dark when the chaotic mob began to throw explosives at the police. Police were forced to open fire in alarm. In the chaos, three villagers died, eight were injured.

 The Guangzhou Daily described the killings as a mistake and said the Guangdong official who had ordered police to open fire had been detained. It did not identify the official.

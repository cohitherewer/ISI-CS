 General fired for sexual slur

 General Kevin Byrnes

 Washington, Aug. 9 (Reuters): The four-star general who headed the US armys training programme has been fired after an investigation into sexual misconduct, officials said today.

 In a rare punishment of a four-star officer ? the highest rank in the military ? General Kevin Byrnes was fired as commanding general of the Army Training and Doctrine Command at Fort Monroe in Virginia, the army said in a statement.

 Army officials did not rule out the possibility of criminal charges or additional administration discipline.

 The investigation upon which this relief is based is undergoing further review to determine the appropriate final disposition of this matter, the army said.

 He was relieved for matters of personal conduct, said Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman. An army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the disciplinary action followed an investigation by the defence department inspector generals office into allegations of personal misconduct of a sexual nature.

 The official offered no further details of the allegations against Byrnes, who is married.

 As head of the Army Training and Doctrine Command, Byrnes was in charge of army training programmes, creating war-fighting guidelines and recruiting new soldiers. He oversaw 50,000 people in 33 schools and centers at 16 army installations.

 Byrnes, a New York native who held the post since 2002, was relieved of his duties yesterday, army spokesman Paul Boyce said.

 Boyce said the investigation into Byrnes had been going on for a couple of months.

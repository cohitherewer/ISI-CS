 Holocaust memorial divides Berlin

 Berlin, May 4 (Reuters): Berlin will unveil a haunting memorial to the murdered Jews of Europe next week after 17 years of charged debate and controversy over how Germany should remember the darkest chapter in its history.

 Situated on a vast plot of land between the Brandenburg Gate and the buried remains of Adolf Hitler?s bunker, the memorial has been hailed by supporters as a courageous symbol of Germany?s readinesss to face up to its grim past. Its detractors have slammed the design ? an open graveyard-like field of rectangular charcoal-grey pillars ? as ugly, overly abstract and a sitting duck for vandals.

 The opening of the memorial on May 10 is unlikely to end a polemic that has raged in German political, religious and artistic circles since feisty journalist Lea Rosh began pushing for a monument to Jewish victims of the Nazis back in 1988. ?It is not self-evident for a nation to put a memorial in the centre of its capital which recalls the worst acts, the most heinous crimes of its own history,? said Wolfgang Thierse, German parliamentary president.

 ?No one can say how this memorial will work, how it will be accepted and whether the criticism will end. I think the debate and the fights it gave rise to are bound to continue.? Designed by US architect Peter Eisenman, the memorial consists of 2,711 pillars, which range in height from a few centimetres to 4.7 metres and form a dense grid pattern through which visitors can wander.

 From a distance, the site looks like a dusky, placid ocean. As one descends on uneven, sloping ground into the memorial the concrete blocks grow more imposing, tilt at irregular angles, and street noise fades. The experience is intended to create feelings of unease and loneliness, encouraging discussion on the plight of the 6 million Jews who died at the hands of the Nazi regime.

 Eisenman views the field as a metaphor for the Nazi regime and the mad, ordered nature of its genocide.

 ?The field looks like it?s reasonable, lined up,? Eisenman said in an interview. ?Then you find the stones are not perfectly horizontal or vertical. There is a warping sensation. It?s unsettling. It seems reasonable from the outside but when you get into it it?s out of control.? 

 At the request of the government, the dark field of pillars has been complemented with an underground information centre which documents, in highly personal fashion, the stories of individual Jews killed by the Third Reich.

 Reaching a consensus on the memorial?s final shape has been a messy process replete with unexpected twists since former Chancellor Helmut Kohl backed the project in 1993.

 Kohl rejected as impractical initial plans to build a 20,000 square metre angled concrete surface on the site, containing the names of all the Jews who died in the Holocaust. He then insisted on changes to the Eisenman plan that prompted the architect?s design partner, sculptor Peter Serra, to drop out.

 In 2001, the memorial foundation was forced to pull down fund-raising posters which awkwardly tried to grab the attention of passers-by with the title: ?The Holocaust never happened?.

 And in October 2003, construction was briefly interrupted after it emerged that the parent of Degussa, the company supplying anti-graffiti protection for the memorial?s pillars, provided Zyklon B gas pellets used in Nazi extermination camps.

 Along this bumpy road, sceptics have questioned what the pillars have to do with the Holocaust, attacked the decision to put the memorial in its high-profile location and wondered aloud about why it is for the Jews and not other Nazi victims.

 Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon will take part in a commemorative march for Holocaust victims in Poland tomorrow, a trip his aides say will symbolise steadfastness in the face of rising anti-Semitism.

 He will join Polish leaders and an estimated 20,000 people from around the world in the annual walk between the former Auschwitz and Birkenau death camps, honouring the 6 million Jews killed in the Nazi Holocaust during World War Two.

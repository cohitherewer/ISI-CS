 2nd Time scribe in leak glare

 Washington, Nov. 28 (Reuters): A second Time magazine reporter has been asked by special prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald to testify in the CIA leak investigation, the magazine disclosed in its December 5 issue.

 Viveca Novak, who covered the inquiry into the leak of CIA operative Valerie Plames cover for Time, has been asked to testify under oath about her conversations starting in May 2004 with Robert Luskin, attorney for White House deputy chief of staff Karl Rove, Time said.

 Plames cover at the CIA was blown after her husband, former diplomat Joseph Wilson, accused the Bush administration of twisting prewar intelligence to support invading Iraq. 

 The two-year investigation resulted in charges of perjury against vice-president Dick Cheneys chief of staff, Lewis Scooter Libby.

 US drop

 New York, Nov. 14: The number of foreign students enrolled in American universities declined slightly in the 2004-5 academic year, according to a survey to be released today, suggesting that a more significant drop that took place in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in 2001 might be abating.

 About 565,000 students from foreign countries were studying in undergraduate and graduate programmes at American universities, a decline of 1 per cent from the previous academic year, according to an annual survey by the Institute of International Education.

 A survey released by the organisation last year showed that foreign student enrollment had declined by 2.4 per cent in the 2003-4 academic year, the first decrease in foreign students in three decades. A related survey released last week b showed that the number of international students entering American graduate schools increased 1 per cent this year. 

 Indians leading

 However, India continues to remain the leading place of origin for the fourth consecutive year with 80,466 students in various US universities, an overall increase of one per cent from the year 2004.

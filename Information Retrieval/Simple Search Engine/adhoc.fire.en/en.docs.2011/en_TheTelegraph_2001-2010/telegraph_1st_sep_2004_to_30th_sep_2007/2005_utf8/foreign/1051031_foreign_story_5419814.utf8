 Iron Camel bids adieu 

 HARRY DE QUETTEVILLE

 Damascus, Oct. 30: It survived sabotage attempts by T.E. Lawrence and bands of Bedouin tribesmen, but after a century of transporting passengers across Arabia, the celebrated Hijaz railway appears to have reached the end of the line. 

 Built in 1900 to link Damascus with the Muslim holy city of Medina, its 1,000 miles of track was long-regarded as the zenith of Ottoman power and engineering skill. In the 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia, a white-robed Peter Toole leads Arab tribes in attacks on the railway as it ferries Ottoman troops to the fronts of the First World War. 

 Today, however, the magnificent rolling stock that once included the sultans personal railway car, resplendent with wood panelling and plush armchairs, has been reduced to a single dilapidated railway carriage. All that remains open of the original line is a truncated section from Damascus to Jordanian capital Amman and even that is facing the axe. 

 Jordanian officials have complained that the tedious and snail-paced service has become financially unsustainable, and the railway that both Lawrence and the Ottomans once considered crucial looks set to close forever. 

 In Damascus, Syrian officials say that the journey ? which takes only couple of hours by car but is a daylong test of endurance by rail ? has been shunned by all but a handful of passengers. 

 Its very old and not many people use it now, said Adnan Ebesh, the deputy manager of the Hijaz Railways. In the past we used to run more trains on this line but now we use it for goods mostly. 

 The Hijaz, named after the northwest section of the Saudi peninsula, opened in 1908 after 6,000 Ottoman navies struggled in searing heat and shifting desert sands to get it laid. In its heyday, it ferried pilgrims to Medina, shortening the journey once made by camel from two months to 55 hours. 

 The new mechanised pilgrimage is called the womens pilgrimage ? for those not up to the rigours of the more traditional voyage. But to the desert Bedouin tribes that lost the pilgrims custom the so-called Iron Camel became a source of resentment and financial ruin.

 to create lifelong loyalty

 Food manufacturers are using sophisticated tactics to market sweets, fast food and sugary breakfast cereals at children in their homes, the Food Commission pressure group said on Tuesday.

 Following criticism of junk food adverts on television, youngsters are being exposed to marketing through story books, educational materials, toys and games. 

 Some of the products ? such as a Cheerios counting book and a Milkybar personalised story book ? are designed to create lifelong brand loyalty, the campaign group claimed.

 The report, in today?s Food magazine, highlights a Cheerios book encouraging toddlers to place cereal pieces into specially cut holes on the page. Cheerios, manufactured by Nestl?, are high in sugar and salt.

 Mars has used a similar technique to promote M amp;M sweets in America.

 A promotion for Nestl? Milkybar encourages parents to collect tokens for a book in which a child?s name is printed into a story featuring the Milkybar Kid and his friends.

 ?When children read books or play games, they are at their most receptive to learning and suggestion. It?s an advertiser?s dream situation,? said Kath Dalmeny, the author of the report. 

 ?By linking food brands to games and books, companies get children to have fun but the children are also advertising fatty, salty and sugary products to themselves.

 ?The companies hope children will build up positive ? even lifelong ? associations with the food brands.? Other examples in the report include the Frosties ?Tigercathlon? website, where children can earn points by taking part in races in a virtual stadium but only if their cartoon characters pick up packets of Frosties to give them enough ?power?. 

 McDonalds was also criticised for licensing fast food toys such as play cash registers, toy burgers and fries and plastic chicken nuggets.

 Last year, the department of health urged the industry to take a more responsible attitude to food promotion to children. 

 A second report released yesterday claimed that junk food marketing on the Internet and via mobile phones to children was a growing European-wide problem. The National Heart Forum, an alliance of health campaigners, said regulation was patchy and inadequate.

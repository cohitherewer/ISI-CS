 Riots spread beyond Paris

 Aulnay-Sous-Bois (France), Nov. 4 (Reuters): Rioters set fire to hundreds of vehicles in impoverished suburbs of northeastern Paris in an eighth night of unrest that spread for the first time to other parts of the capital and towns in France.

 Local officials said they had lost patience with the government. Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin and his rival, interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy, opted for low profiles after days of squabbling over how to handle the crisis.

 Police reported fewer clashes than previous nights and residents said the Id holiday may have calmed areas with many Muslims of north African and black African origin who feel treated as second-class citizens.

 But the rioting spread, with some attacks reported in western Paris suburbs ? including the spectacular burning of 23 buses at a depot ? and a few cars firebombed around Rouen in northern France, Dijon in the east and Marseille in the south.

 The pattern of violence also changed, shifting from crowds clashing with police to targeted arson attacks, many against businesses and warehouses.

 Ive had enough of this, said an angry woman wearing a headscarf in Aulnay-sous-Bois, a northeastern Paris suburb where a large warehouse was burned down overnight. This must stop quickly. Its just not right.

 Mayors from the riot-hit areas were also exasperated after Villepin briefed them last evening about an action plan for the suburbs he aims to present later this month.

 Many of us told him this isnt the time for an umpteenth plan, said Jean-Christophe Lagarde, mayor of Drancy. All we need is one death and I think it will get out of control.

 Justice minister Pascal Clement was visibly shaken after being briefed about a handicapped woman in her 50s who was badly burned on Wednesday evening when rioters poured petrol on a city bus she was riding in and set it ablaze. 

 This is immense violence, he said in Bobigny, another town in the Seine Saint Denis department between central Paris and Charles de Gaulle airport that has been the worst hit. I think all French are shocked to see things like this.

 With the blazing suburbs making headlines around the world, foreign ministry spokesman Jean-Baptiste Mattei complained about foreign coverage of the riots ? without naming any media ? and said foreign tourists were not in danger. One is sometimes surprised at the international coverage of these events, he said. 

 Officials in Seine Saint Denis said 187 vehicles had been destroyed there overnight. Police detained 27 people and reported two injuries. French media said up to 600 vehicles were destroyed in the whole greater Paris region, including 23 buses.

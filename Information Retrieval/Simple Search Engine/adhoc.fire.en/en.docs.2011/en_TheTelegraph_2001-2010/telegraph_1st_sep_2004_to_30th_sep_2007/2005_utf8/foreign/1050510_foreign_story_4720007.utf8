 Harry was weak student: Ex-teacher

 Sarah Forsyth

 London, May 9 (AFP): Prince Harry was a ?weak? student at school whose final work for an art examination was completed by a member of staff, a former teacher at his prestigious private school alleged today.

 Sarah Forsyth, who is claiming unfair dismissal by Eton College, also told an employment tribunal that she wrote virtually all the accompanying text for an art project submitted to external examiners by the prince, now 20.

 She considered this to be ?unethical and probably constituted to cheating?, Forsyth, a former art teacher at the elite school which charges more than ?22,000 a year.

 When the case began in october last year ? it was later adjourned ? Forsyth alleged she had been ordered by a school administrator to help the young royal pass his art exam. Harry began training to become a British army officer yesterday at the Sandhurst Military Academy, a place that was dependent on certain minimum examination results.

 The prince just qualified with a B grade in art and a D in geography in his final school examinations taken by 18-year-olds in England.

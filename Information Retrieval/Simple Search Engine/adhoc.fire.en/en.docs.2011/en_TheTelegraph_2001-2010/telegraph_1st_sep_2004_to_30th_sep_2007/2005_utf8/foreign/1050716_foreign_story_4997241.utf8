 Extremism wake-up call for community 

 Ian Blair

 London, July 15 (Reuters): Britains most senior policeman called on the countrys Muslim community today to end its denial about extremists in its midst and to engage actively in the fight against terrorism.

 Muslim leaders have expressed shock that four British-born Muslims were the perpetrators of last weeks attacks on London which left at least 54 dead. But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Ian Blair said Muslims could do more to help find those plotting further atrocities.

 We have a moment now in which we can engage with the Muslim community and move them from what could be described as a bit of denial into active engagement around counter-terrorism, Blair told BBC TV.

 Who are the preachers of hate? Who are the people who are looking to groom bombers? Blair asked, adding that a number of British Muslims had been to Iraq and training camps abroad.

 The Muslim community somewhere will know who these people are. Weve now got to engage with them so that they give us the information, Blair added.

 Moderate Muslim groups already cooperate with police on security issues but acknowledge that many alienated young Muslims have drifted away and become vulnerable to indoctrination.

 There is a deep sense of alienation in parts of the community, from poverty, from unemployment, from poor education, said Daud Abdullah, assistant secretary general of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), the countrys largest Islamic organisation.

 I think we have to work more with our youth. We have to win their hearts and minds and bring them back from the fringes, he said.

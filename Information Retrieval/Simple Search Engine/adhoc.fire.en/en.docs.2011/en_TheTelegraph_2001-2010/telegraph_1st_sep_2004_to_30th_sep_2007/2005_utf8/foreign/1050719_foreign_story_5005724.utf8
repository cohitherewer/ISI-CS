 CIA agent leak by Rove: Scribe

 Washington, July 18 (Reuters): White House political aide Karl Rove was the first person to tell a Time magazine reporter that the wife of a prominent critic of the Bush administrations Iraq policy was a CIA agent, the reporter said in an article yesterday.

 Time correspondent Matthew Cooper said he told a grand jury last week that Rove told him the woman worked at the agency, or CIA, on weapons of mass destruction issues, and ended the call by saying: Ive already said too much. Democrats have urged President George W. Bush to fire or sideline Rove, Bushs top political adviser.

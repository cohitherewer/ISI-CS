 Tabloids show no royal mercy

 London, April 7 (Reuters): Romance is in the air this week as Prince Charles prepares to marry his long-time paramour Camilla Parker Bowles, but there is no love lost between the royal family and Britain?s irreverent tabloids.

 In a far cry from the sycophancy of bygone days, newspapers have delighted in reporting a series of mishaps that have befallen the wedding plans. One tabloid even published an altered front-page photo depicting the bride-to-be as a horse.

 ?Wedding switch forces Chas? old nag to miss the big race,? the Daily Star red-top ? as all Britains tabloids are known for their colourful banners ? wrote about a scheduling conflict, now resolved, between the wedding and the Grand National horse race. The Star covered the first news of the wedding under the headline: ?Boring Old Gits to Wed.?

 The Daily Mail weighed in with ?Can Anything Else Possibly Go Wrong?? after Pope John Paul?s funeral forced a re-scheduling of the marriage. Others also have taken their shots, with the top-selling Sun proclaiming: ?JINXED: Queen?s despair at Charles?s curse.?

 Opinion polls show that most Britons do not want Camilla to be queen. Many blame her for breaking up the marriage between Charles and Princess Diana, who was so loved by the tabloids for her ability to boost profits that she was known as the Princess of Sales. 

 With pop culture increasingly focused on celebrity gossip, the royals have not been immune. ?Our tabloid media is as much about entertainment as it is about news,? said Charles Anson, former spokesman for the Queen. ?Even though it?s been vituperative at times, the coverage can occasionally be fantastic for such events as the Golden Jubilee,? he added, referring to the 50th anniversary celebrations of Queen Elizabeth?s reign in 2002.

 Fleet Street treated the monarchy with reverence for decades, but both camps point a finger at the arrival of Australian-American media baron Rupert Murdoch for the acrimonious relationship that exists now. Murdoch bought the Sun in 1969 and re-launched it as a gossip and celebrity sheet, giving royal correspondent Harry Arnold orders to dish dirt, not extol. ?I think Rupert, being colonial, didn?t want to kowtow to the royal family? Arnold told US public broadcaster PBS.

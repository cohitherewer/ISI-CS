 Zardari vows to fight Musharraf regime

 Dubai, Jan. 1 (PTI): Asif Ali Zardari, who arrived here to an emotional family reunion after eight years in prison, has said nothing could stop him from returning to his home country and vowed to fight the regime of President Pervez Musharraf.

 ?That is not even a remote possibility, nobody can stop me from returning. I don?t get stopped so easily,? said Zardari, 51. ?I?m a fighter, I will stay and fight. This is a struggle against military dictatorship. 

 ?By serving an eleven-year jail term, eight now and three years before that, I?ve proved that a civilian like me has the strength to stand up to the military,? he was quoted as saying by the Gulf News today.

 He also denied rumours of any deal with the regime. ?I didn?t break. Neither did my wife, who was in jail during the Zia years for five years. Nor did my father-in-law who paid for it with his life. She didn?t do a deal for herself, neither did Shaheed (Zulfikar Ali) Bhutto. How can I even think of it? It?s a hard act to follow.? He said the next challenge was to see that Pakistan returns to true democracy, not the sham that President Musharraf is foisting on the people.

 Asked if he was prepared for a return to jail if cases are re-opened against him, Zardari said: ?In Third World countries like ours, it?s a risk you must be willing to take. As for me, jail does not frighten me.? The former senator and cabinet minister was arrested in 1996 and freed on bail after eight years in custody. He was re-arrested for a day in December when bail was withdrawn in one of several cases pending against him. 

 Later, he was given a passport to travel after being removed from the governments exit control list. 

 Strongly denying any ?deal? between Musharraf and Benazir?s Opposition Pakistan Peoples Party, Zardari said: ?If I wanted to make a deal, I could have done it eight years ago.?

 Asked if there was even a second when he felt that his party or Benazir could have freed him if they met the government?s pre-condition that Benazir quit politics, he said: ?No, not even once in all these five-and-a-half years.?

 He pointed to the judgement in the BMW case in which he was charged with not paying duty on the import of luxury cars as a turning point. 

 ?Even a former information minister and a member of the Nawaz Sharif government like Mushahid Hussain has apologised and admitted that their government had foisted these false cases against us. All these cases are politically motivated.?

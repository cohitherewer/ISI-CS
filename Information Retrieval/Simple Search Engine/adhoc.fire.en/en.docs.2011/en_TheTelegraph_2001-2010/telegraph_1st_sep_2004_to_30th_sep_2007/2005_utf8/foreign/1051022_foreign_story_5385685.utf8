 A Mao wedding

 Beijing, Oct. 21 (PTI): Although many said chairman Mao Zedong would live on after his death in 1976, few would have expected to find him providing wedding entertainment nearly 30 years later.

 But the late chairman is becoming a familiar sight in Changchun, capital of northeast Chinas Jilin province, the China Daily newspaper reported today.

 With his theme tune, East is Red, which has always been associated with Mao, Li Shouxin makes his entrance at wedding banquets dressed in a blue Mao suit. He begins with a typical Mao-style wave to guests before greeting people in the strong Hunan brogue of the leaders home province. 

 He then invites the happy couples parents to speak and tells anecdotes about the newlywed. 

 My grandparents are veteran soldiers from the Red Army, and my father is also a Peoples Liberation Army soldier. Our family has a deep connection to the great man. By hiring Li we made the wedding a unique and unforgettable experience, said one of Lis clients.

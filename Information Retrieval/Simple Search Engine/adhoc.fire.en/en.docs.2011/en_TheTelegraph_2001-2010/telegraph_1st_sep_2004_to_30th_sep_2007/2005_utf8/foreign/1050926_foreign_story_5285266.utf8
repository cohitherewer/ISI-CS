 Preparations pay off

 Washington, Sept. 25: Reinforced armies of federal search teams, medics and National Guard troops began fanning out into wind-whipped and waterlogged southwestern Louisiana and coastal Texas yesterday, racing to prove the government had learned from its disastrous missteps earlier this month on the Gulf Coast. 

 And while yesterdays early assessments were positive ? with few reports of unanswered calls for help or broad communication breakdowns that crippled the response to Hurricane Katrina ? officials acknowledged that Hurricane Rita had not presented the ultimate test for which they had prepared. 

 Hurricane Katrina was so much more massive. Most people still dont understand that, said Michael Lowder, deputy director of response operations at the Federal Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Washington. In New Orleans the levees failed, then you had the civil unrest piece of it. That was something that was not planned for, not anticipated. ... That affects the whole response.

 Although floodwater was still rising yesterday in some low-lying towns and wind restricted damage assessment flights, state and federal authorities cautiously projected confidence in their ability to respond to the storm in coming days, at least partly because it was far less damaging. Officials also attributed their success to the sometimes chaotic evacuation of three million people from Houston and other cities, an exodus left incomplete in New Orleans before Katrina hit on August 29. 

 In last weeks run-up to the storm, US officials took advantage of a second chance to test the nations emergency response system after its near-collapse in New Orleans. Preparations dwarfed those before Katrina. 

 The big difference is that we have been gearing up our entire system for a month now, Robert Stephan, assistant secretary of homeland security for infrastructure protection, said. Theres no warm-up period ? the car is started and ready to go.

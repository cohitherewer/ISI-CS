 Camilla absent at banquet

 Camilla Parker Bowles

 London, March 16: The Prince of Wales has attended a Buckingham Palace state banquet ? without his fiancee.

 Camilla Parker Bowles? absence from last night?s banquet in honour of Carlo Ciampi, Italy?s President, will add to mounting speculation that her presence at a high-profile official event is not yet considered to be appropriate.

 In contrast, Lady Diana Spencer was his guest at a palace state banquet the month before their wedding in July 1981.

 A spokeswoman for the prince at Clarence House, his London home, said Parker Bowles? presence at the banquet was considered but she was unable to attend.

 It remains to be seen how soon after their April 8 civil wedding the prince and his wife, the Duchess of Cornwall, are able to be together at a major royal engagement.

 During the banquet, held on the first day of Ciampis state visit, the Queen hailed Britain?s links with Italy, observing that the British were enthusiastic admirers of Italian culture, fashion and food.

 The Queen said: ?I can never forget the many young British soldiers who died in the World War II fighting to liberate Italy from tyranny, a fight in which you, Mr President, played a distinguished part.?

 2 Saudi women win in Jeddah local polls

 Riyadh, Nov. 30 (Reuters): Two Saudi women triumphed today in an unprecedented election to a local business group, the first vote in the conservative Muslim kingdom where women campaigned openly for office.

 Im a bit in shock, but this shows people are ready for women to play a role, said Lama Sulaiman, one of two businesswomen to win a seat on the 18-strong board of Jeddahs Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

 The vote in the relatively liberal city of Jeddah is seen as a landmark for Saudi women after they were barred from voting or standing in elections to municipal councils earlier this year.

 Sulaiman and Nashwa Taher will be joined by 10 men in the Jeddah chamber and another six people who will be appointed by the government. 

 Its an achievement. Of course we would love more (women) but for a beginning its an achievement, Taher said. Only 100 women voted in the election, compared to 4,000 men, Taher said, showing that she and Sulaiman had won strong support from male voters.

 King Abdullah has made the promotion of women in society a priority for Saudi Arabias economic development but emphasised that any steps will be in line with Islamic principles.

 Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, follows the austere Wahhabi school of Sunni Islam. Women cannot drive, must be covered up in public and should not mix with men outside their immediate family. We did our best and showed the world and our society that we are ready to take responsibility, said Madawi al-Hassoun, a losing woman candidate.

 All 12 victorious candidates were part of a joint platform called For Jeddah, which pledged to support small businesses for men and women and make Jeddah more attractive to investors.

 The Jeddah chamber already promotes women in business through its Khadija Centre, named after the wife of Prophet Mohammad who was a successful businesswoman 14 centuries ago.

 Miami crash

 Miami, Dec. 20 (Reuters): A seaplane packed with passengers crashed in flames off Miami Beach and sank into the US citys main shipping channel yesterday, killing at least 19 people, authorities said.

 The twin-engine seaplane crashed just off the southern tip of Miami Beach after taking off for the Bahamian island of Bimini with 18 passengers, including three infants, and two crew, said Roger Nair, general manager of Chalks Ocean Airways, which operated the ill-fated aircraft.

 Miami Beach City manager Jorge Gonzalez said 19 bodies had been recovered from the crash site.

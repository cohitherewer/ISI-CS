 Ono draws flak over Lennon musical

 New York, Aug. 13 (Reuters): A new musical about John Lennon opens in New York this weekend and the cast and director are hoping a major overhaul since it was first seen in San Francisco will win over audiences and sniping critics.

 A 10-day delay to the opening of Lennon to allow last-minute changes has only fuelled the rumour mill, with Lennons widow Yoko Ono coming in for some harsh jibes.

 The widow Lennon is up to her old tricks, undermining last-ditch efforts to save the seriously flawed bio musical about her late husband at every turn, the New York Post said this week, reporting trouble at the production.

 Ono, an artist and musician who married Lennon in 1969, controls the rights to the former Beatles songs and has been closely involved in the show since it was first put to her nearly seven years ago by director Don Scardino.

 Its tough; John Lennon is a huge icon now ... everybody has their own expectation of how to present the story of John Lennon, Scardino said in an interview ahead of tomorrows opening night, attributing scepticism about the show to enduring resentment from Beatles fans who disliked Ono.

 People hated him for leaving the Beatles or for falling in love with Yoko ... they wanted him to be a Beatle and he fought that all his life, Scardino said.

 The show was originally conceived in what Scardino describes as a concert format ? a series of songs punctuated by anecdotes with each of the nine cast members taking it in turns to play the role of Lennon. Audiences were confused.

 The latest incarnation has one actor as the main Lennon narrating the story of his life in a much more chronological order, from his childhood in Liverpool to his assassination in New York in front of the famous Dakota Building in 1980.

 There is also more about the Beatles and Lennons first wife Cynthia, aspects of his life that barely featured in the original version. And Onos character appears later in the show in a bid to avert suggestions it is as much about her as about Lennon.

 I think the San Francisco show might have been guilty of that, it may have been a little too reverential of John and Yokos side of the story, said Michael Potts, who sings several songs as Lennon. But I think its more balanced now, he said. Its not going to please everyone, he added.

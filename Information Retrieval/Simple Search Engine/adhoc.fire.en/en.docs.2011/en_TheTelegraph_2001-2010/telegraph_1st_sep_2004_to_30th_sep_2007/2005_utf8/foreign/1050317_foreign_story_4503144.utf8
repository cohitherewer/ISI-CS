 Cheers at Iran hanging

 Pakdasht (Iran), March 16 (Reuters): Angry relatives of victims of an Iranian serial killer cheered, whistled and clapped as he was flogged, stabbed, slapped and finally hanged in public today.

 Around 3,000 people gathered in the main square of Pakdasht, south of the capital Tehran, to see the execution of Mohammad Bijeh, who was convicted of kidnapping, raping and murdering 21 people, most of them young boys.

 Bijeh was first lashed 100 times by officials before the brother of one of his victims stabbed him in the back.

 Bond has no Q and no gadgets in Royale

 HUGH DAVIES

 London, Sept. 17: The next James Bond film, Casino Royale, will return 007 to a more traditional role, according to its scriptwriter, Paul Haggis.

 He said there would be no Q and no gadgets and the 21st Bond movie would move away from its special-effects, blockbuster predecessors.

 This will be the first time that Q, recently played by John Cleese, has not appeared in a Bond film since Live and Let Die. The book Casino Royale, Ian Flemings first Bond novel, did not contain the character when it appeared in 1953. The dumping of costly spectacular scenes is in line with Hollywood studios wanting to return spy movies to the thriller mode, with character and plot driving the action, as in The Bourne Identity. 

 Speaking at the Toronto film festival, Haggis said of Casino Royale: Were trying to reinvent Bond. Hes 28.

 This would appear to eliminate the current front runner for the role of the sixth Bond, 37-year-old Daniel Craig, who starred in Road to Perdition, Layer Cake and Enduring Love. George Lazenby was 29 when he starred in On Her Majestys Secret Service in 1969.

 Sir Roger Moore, the former 007, reckons that Ewan McGregor, 34, should be the candidate, although he may, at 5feet 10 inches, be an inch and a half too short. 

 McGregor is leaving the West End revival of Guys and Dolls on December 3, perfect timing for the new film, which begins shooting in the Bahamas in January for a scheduled release on October 19 next year.

 Haggis, a Canadian, who won an Oscar nomination for his screenplay of Clint Eastwoods Million Dollar Baby, joined the production last month to polish a draft script by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, both Bond veterans.

 Wade said: Its very difficult to think of new ways of blowing things up. Its the journey thats the thing ? finding a new journey for the character.

 Dame Judi Dench will be back as M, and the books renowned torture scene is to be included. Casino Royale was filmed in 1967 as a farce with David Niven as the ageing Sir James Bond. The Bond purists loathed it.

 The latest Bond film, Die Another Day, starring Pierce Brosnan, was released by MGM in 2002. But last year, Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, the sibling producers who control the Bond franchise, told the 52-year-old Irishman that after four films they would not require his services for the new one. 

 It was a big mistake to let Pierce go, said casting agent Debra Zane. Hes got it all. Who cares if hes in his early fifties? Hes completely Bond.

 Unhappy? Try film therapy

 ROYA NIKKHAH

 Kidman: Moulin magic

 London, March 6: Psychotherapists are to use feature films as a tool to encourage patients to talk more freely about their problems, in a scheme backed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists.

 Pioneers of ?movie therapy? claim that discussing characters and plot lines from an appropriate film can help people to understand their feelings better and allow them to confront psychological issues that are troubling them. The technique is already being taught to psychotherapists training at Guy?s Hospital in London. 

 One of those using the method is Bernie Wooder, a psychotherapist, who charges ?45 for a one-hour ?movie therapy? session. He said: ?I was counselling a woman who had been badly let down in a relationship, but was having difficulty articulating her emotions.

 ?I told her that her situation reminded me of On The Waterfront, when Marlon Brando?s character realises his brother is crooked and he feels enormous betrayal. My client immediately identified with how he felt and watching and discussing the film was a catalyst for unlocking all the feelings she had repressed. Each time she watched and cried, she felt better.?

 Wooder said while film therapy did not work for everyone, he had used it successfully with about a third of his clients. ?Freud said that images are the language of the unconscious and I believe films are too. Through their characters, plots and even music, films can bring out the most deeply buried emotions.?

 Maureen McCooke, a 35-year-old publisher from London, said she had used Moulin Rouge to recover from depression following a failed marriage. ?It took a long time for me to open up, but I found that if you can find something in a movie to relate to, it really can help,? she said.

 ?The romance between Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman?s characters made me realise that I had never really loved my husband. I try to use the lessons I learnt from that film in real life and have a greater understanding of how deep my feelings are for people in relationships.?

 Dr Rex Haigh, a consultant psychiatrist at the Berkshire Healthcare Trust and a member of the psychotherapy faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said that he welcomed movie therapy as an alternative to more conventional methods, but only if used in conjunction with other forms of treatment.

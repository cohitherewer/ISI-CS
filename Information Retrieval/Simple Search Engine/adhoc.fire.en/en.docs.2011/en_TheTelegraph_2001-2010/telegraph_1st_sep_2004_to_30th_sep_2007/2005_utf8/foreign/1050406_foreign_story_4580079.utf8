 UK polls hint at real contest

 London, April 5 (Reuters): Prime Minister Tony Blair confirmed today the worst-kept secret in British politics ? that an election will be held on May 5 ? as polls suggested a real contest for the first time since 1992.

 With Iraq weighing heavily on his ratings, Blair put his government?s economic credentials at the heart of the campaign. Confirming the date after visiting Queen Elizabeth in traditional pre-election protocol, Blair vowed to build on eight years of growth to entrench future investment in public services ? which he says his Conservative opponents will slash.

 ?It?s a big choice, it?s a big decision. The British people are the boss and they are the ones that will make it,? he said outside his Downing Street office. 

 Blair had delayed the long-expected announcement by a day due to the death at the weekend of Pope John Paul.

 Public anger over the Iraq war could slash Blair?s parliamentary majority ? five new opinion polls showed his party has lost support to the main Opposition Conservatives.

 Embarrassingly, one of the ruling Labour party?s candidates, Stephen Wilkinson, said today he was defecting to the Liberal Democrats, the only major British party to oppose the Iraq war. 

 ?Who would have thought a Labour government would become a lap dog to George Bush?s Right-wing Republican administration,? Wilkinson said.

 Conservative leader Michael Howard focused on Blair?s perceived Achilles Heel ? reduced public trust post-Iraq. ?The choice before voters on May 5 is very clear,? he told party supporters. 

 Surveys in today?s Guardian, Times and Independent newspapers gave Labour a lead of just two or three percentage points.

 Separate surveys of voters who said they would definitely vote even gave the Conservatives a lead.

 If those figures were replicated on polling day, analysts say, Blair would still win a third term but with a much looser grip on parliament. At the previous two elections in 1997 and 2001, Blair easily won triple-digit majorities.

 Britains electoral map, which concentrates constituencies in Labours urban strongholds, means the Conservatives must win a larger share of the vote than Labour to take power.

 The Financial Times said the 5-point Conservative lead in its poll of definite voters would still return Blair to power but with a parliamentary majority slashed from 161 seats to just 27.

 If he wins, Blair would make history by becoming the first Labour premier to clinch a third consecutive term, equalling the record of former Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher.

 Blair came to power in 1997 after the 1992 vote, which Labour had been widely expected to win, swung to the Conservatives at the last minute.

 If Blairs power is weakened this time, he could quickly become a lame duck as he has already stated he will not seek a fourth term.

 The biggest fear of Labour strategists, mirroring the polling evidence, is that their core supporters do not bother to turn out.

 Blair will visit a key marginal constituency later on Tuesday to ram home that point. (Additional reporting by Madeline Chambers, Peter Graff)

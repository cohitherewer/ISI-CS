 Pak rape victim files appeal

 Islamabad, March 26 (Reuters): The victim of a notorious gangrape in Pakistan filed an appeal with the country?s top court today against the acquittal of five of the six men convicted of the crime.

 Mukhtaran Mai, who was raped in 2002 on orders of a village council, filed the appeal with the Supreme Court in Islamabad against the March 3 ruling by a provincial high court. Mai?s rape provoked an outcry in Pakistan and focused international attention on the plight of women in rural Pakistan after she took the rare step of going public about her ordeal.

 An anti-terrorism court sentenced six men to death in July 2002 for the attack ? four for carrying out rape and two who sat on the village council.

 But the high court in the central city of Multan overturned the ruling, acquitting five of the six, citing a lack of evidence and commuting the sentence of the sixth to life in prison.

 Clad in a black embroidered shawl, Mai said after filing her appeal: ?One should always remain hopeful and I am hopeful I will get justice.?

 The village council ordered Mai?s rape as a punishment after her brother, who was just 12 at the time, was judged to have offended tribal honour by befriending a 30-year-old woman from the powerful Mastoi clan.

 Mai has since become an icon for women rights in conservative Muslim Pakistan and has set up a school for girls in her village with donations from the government and supporters at home and abroad.

 Psycho slur on Basinger

 Alec Baldwin 

 Los Angles, Nov. 1 (AP): Actors Alec Baldwin and his ex-wife Kim Basinger traded personal jabs through their attorneys, with each claiming amid a custody dispute that the other has serious emotional problems.

 In court papers, Baldwin claimed Basinger has a pathological need to turn their daughter against him, and he is asking for a psychological evaluation for her.

 Baldwins lawyer Vicki Greene argued in a court hearing today that Basinger had tainted 10-year-old Irelands view of her father.

 Basingers attorney, Neal Hersh, dismissed the claim. We believe that Mr Baldwin has severe emotional problems, Hersh said. Mr Baldwins lawyers attempted to cast terrible aspersions toward Kim rather than focusing on the main issue, which is his daughter.

 Baldwin was not at the hearing, which discussed his telephone time with his daughter and whether he should get an extra weekend with her when a holiday is interrupted by a custody hearing.

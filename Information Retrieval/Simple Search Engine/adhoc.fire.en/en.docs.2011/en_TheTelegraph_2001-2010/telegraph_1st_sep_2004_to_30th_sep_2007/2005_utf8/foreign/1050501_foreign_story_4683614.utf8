 Vietnam marks end of war

 Ho Chi Minh City, April 30 (Reuters): Vietnam celebrated the 30th anniversary of the end of ?The American War? today, baking a four-tonne cake for Liberation Day babies and staging a military parade without a real tank in sight.

 The communist nation?s top leaders, as well as retired General Vo Nguyen Giap, the 94-year-old military chief whose tactics subdued first the French then the Americans, attended the key celebrations in the city known in war years as Saigon.

 Vietnam this time mustered only a single fake wooden tank and no missiles as hundreds of soldiers made a march past. Concerned that too visible a show of ?triumphalism? could harm crucial economic ties with the US, Hanoi made sure that this year?s celebrations were as much about the future as the past.

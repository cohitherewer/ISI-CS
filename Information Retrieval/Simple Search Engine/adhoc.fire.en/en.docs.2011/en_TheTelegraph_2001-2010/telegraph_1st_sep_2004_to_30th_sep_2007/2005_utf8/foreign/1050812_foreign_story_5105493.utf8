 Iran urged to stop N-work

 Vienna, Aug. 11 (Reuters): The governing board of the UN nuclear watchdog today unanimously called on Iran to halt sensitive atomic work it resumed this week, a demand Tehran has rejected as unacceptable and illegal.

 The resolution adopted by the International Atomic Energy Agencys (IAEA) board of governors says Iran must resume a full suspension of all nuclear fuel related activities and asks the agency to verify Tehrans compliance.

 The resolution on Iran was just adopted without a vote by consensus, full consensus. All 35 members of the board agreed the language of the resolution text, IAEA spokeswoman Melissa Fleming said.

 The IAEA board began meeting on Tuesday but adjourned to allow the EU time to negotiate the Iran resolution with the board members. It reconvened today to approve the draft after days of backroom negotiations on the text.

 The resolution, drafted by Britain, Germany and France, requests IAEA chief Mohamed ElBaradei to provide a comprehensive report on the implementation of Irans NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty) Safeguards Agreement and this resolution by September 3, 2005.

 Iran resumed activities at the Isfahan uranium conversion plant on Monday. Despite US and EU calls that it not resume work there, Tehran yesterday broke the UN seals and made the facility fully operational.

 The text did not say Iran should be referred to the UN Security Council, which has the power to impose sanctions.

 Iran rejected the draft resolution, saying it violated the NPT, the global pact against nuclear arms.

 The EUs resolution is unacceptable and we reject it, Mohammad Saeedi, deputy head of Irans Atomic Energy Organisation and a senior member of its delegation to the IAEA meeting, said before the resolution was approved.

 Iran does not accept the resolution as it is not legal and also it is against the NPT, he said.

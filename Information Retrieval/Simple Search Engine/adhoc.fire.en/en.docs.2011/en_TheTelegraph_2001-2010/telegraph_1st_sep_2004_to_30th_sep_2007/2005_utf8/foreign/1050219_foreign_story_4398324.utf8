 Radiation respite for cellphones

 Helsinki, Feb. 18 (Reuters): A Finnish survey of some of the world?s most popular mobile phones found the amount of radiation they emit is well below agreed limits and largely in line with data published by manufacturers.

 The annual survey by Finland?s Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority (STUK) covered 16 new models made by top handset makers including Finland?s Nokia, Motorola of the US and South Korea?s Samsung Electronics.

 It follows the first study of 12 models done in 2003.

 Mobile phones are essentially tiny radios that send and receive signals over airwaves.

 All the tested models showed a specific absorption rate (SAR), which measures the amount of heat trapped by a phone user?s head, well below the 2 watts per kg level agreed on in Europe.

 At this level, head tissue does not warm significantly and no other harmful effects have been proved scientifically, STUK said. 

 It said the SAR levels in all the 28 models tested so far ranged from 0.45 to 1.12 watts per kg.

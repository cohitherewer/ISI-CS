 Iraq visit

 Tehran, Nov. 21 (Reuters): Jalal Talabani, the first Iraqi President to visit Iran for nearly four decades, received assurances today that Tehran supported its neighbours transition to democracy.

 Shia Iran has repeatedly been accused of meddling in post-war Iraq, with western and Iraqi officials charging Iran with allowing weapons and insurgents to cross its borders. But Irans President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said such accusations were unfounded and voiced by those who did not want better ties between Baghdad and Tehran, who fought each other to a standstill in a 1980-1988 war.

 Talabani, said his visit was aimed at strengthening political and commercial ties.

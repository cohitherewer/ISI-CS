 Fine Print

 Monster girl power

 Los Angeles, May 2 (Reuters): With the exception of Norwegian act Magnet, look for an all-female line-up on New Line Records?s Monster-in-Law soundtrack.

 The film centres on clashing female leads played by Jennifer Lopez and Jane Fonda. New Line senior vice-president of music Bob Bowen says the studio knew that the strong female cast would translate to an album audience of mainly women.

 Bowen, who worked as music supervisor for the film and alongside soundtrack producer Jason Linn on the album, says the effort isn?t a ?typical romantic comedy soundtrack, because we tried to appeal to both (Fonda?s) and (Lopez?s) audiences.?

 Though Lopez is not on the album, it does feature tracks ranging from newcomer Jem to jazz artist Madeleine Peyroux. Cuts from Joss Stone, Tegan amp; Sara and Rachael Yamagata also made the cut.

 Charity hit tops charts

 London (Reuters): Seventies crooner 

 Tony Christie and comedian Peter Kay have won a seventh 

 week at the top of the British hit parade with their charity 

 release (Is This The Way To) Amarillo, the Official 

 UK Charts Company said on Sunday. The single, issued to 

 raise money for Comic Relief, restricted new entry Signs 

 from rapper Snoop Dogg, R amp;B singer Charlie Wilson and 

 pop heartthrob Justin Timberlake to second place.

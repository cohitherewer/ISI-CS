 Elite Rome tailor has new pope all sewn up

 Rome, April 12 (Reuters): Cardinals start choosing a new pope next week, but the successor to John Paul will be all sewn up well before the secret conclave opens.

 In a cobblestoned street behind Rome?s Pantheon, tailor Filippo Gammarelli is adding the final stitches to an item that Monday?s meeting will not start without ? the white vestments the new pope will wear when he first appears to the world. Because Gammarelli has no clue who that pope will be, he is making three versions of the silk and wool outfit, in small, medium and large, to clothe the most lean or corpulent cardinal.

 ?We deliver the three sets to the Vatican before the conclave and that is the last we hear about it until the new pope appears on the balcony of St. Peter?s,? Gammarelli, said.

 Gammarelli?s is probably the world?s most elite personal tailor. Its tiny door, set back on a cobblestone square, has never lowered itself to taking orders for an English earl?s shooting tweeds or a tuxedo for a US billionaire.

 Since its founding in 1798, the tiny shop has restricted its services to the highest echelons of the Roman Catholic Church. Its trade is chasubles and mitres, stoles and lace surplices, Roman collars and cardinal red socks, packed thick into its dark wood cupboards.

 Pinochet charged with fraud

 Santiago, Nov. 23 (Reuters): Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was charged today with tax fraud, passport forgery and other crimes related to an estimated $27 million stashed in secret bank accounts under false names.

 Judge Carlos Cerda, who is also the prosecutor on the case, issued the indictment, put Pinochet under house arrest, and set bail at $23,000. 

 Additional charges include using false documents and incomplete statement of assets.

 Pinochet, who will turn 90 on Friday, has been indicted in two human rights cases in the last five years, but the cases were thrown out by courts which ruled that his mild dementia, caused by frequent mini-strokes, made him unfit to face trial.

 Today (hes charged with) economic crimes, lets hope that tomorrow its for the genocide that took place during 17 years of dictatorship, Lorena Pizarro, president of one of Chiles biggest human rights groups, said at the Santiago tribunal building.

 Saber wars

 Los Angeles, July 27 (Reuters): Light sabers used by Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars movies are expected to fetch around $60,000 each at a Beverly Hills movie memorabilia auction on Friday.

 The two light sabers from the original Star Wars and its 1980 sequel Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back are among more than 75 artifacts in an auction that also includes Harrison Fords signature leather jacket from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, estimated to fetch some $50,000.

 The Star Wars treasures come from the collection of producer Gary Kurtz, who worked closely with director George Lucas from 1973-1981

 Daring dip

 Beijing (Reuters): A heatwave in China 

 has led to a rash of nude swimming this summer, sparking 

 a moral debate over whether such skinny-dips should be allowed, 

 a newspaper reported on Wednesday. I was totally stunned 

 and flushed at the first sight of these naked men, 

 the China Daily quoted Zhao Yanjie as saying. Zhao 

 was moved to call on police to prevent such behaviour after 

 she and her family stumbled upon a group of nude bathers 

 while out for an evening stroll.

 Bag bother

 Brussels (Reuters): An escaped convict was caught by police in Brussels when he tried to steal the handbag of an off-duty policewoman, police said on Wednesday. The 34-year-old man was caught by another off-duty officer on Tuesday after failing to snatch the womans bag. He had assaulted the woman as she and the officer were going home a few blocks away from a police station.

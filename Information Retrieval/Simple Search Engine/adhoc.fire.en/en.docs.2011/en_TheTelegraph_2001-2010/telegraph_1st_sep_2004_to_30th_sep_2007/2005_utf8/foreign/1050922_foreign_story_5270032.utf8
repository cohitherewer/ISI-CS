 Basra (Iraq), Sept. 21 (Reuters): Iraqi police staged an angry anti-British protest in Basra today as London and Baghdad sought to quell tension over a British raid to free two undercover soldiers held in the southern city.

 About 200 policemen who work at the police station damaged during the British raid marched through the streets, calling for the city police chief to be fired and for the British terrorists to be returned to Iraqi jurisdiction. British forces raided the police station and jail to free two undercover soldiers who were detained by Iraqi security forces following a firefight on Monday.

 In the raid, British armoured vehicles crushed the walls of the jail before troops rescued the men said by the British to have been held by a militia group who had gained custody of them from police.

 But Iraqs interior minister disputed the British militarys account. Bayan Jabor told the BBC the men had never left police custody, or the jail, and were not handed to militants.

 The Iraqi government said in a statement there was no crisis with Britain, but senior Iraqi officials have castigated the raid, with Basra province governor calling it a barbaric act.

 In London, Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari met defence secretary John Reid to discuss the incident and afterwards the two said diplomatic ties had not been harmed.

 It will not affect the relationship between Iraq and Britain, said Reid, who is under pressure over the deployment of 8,500 troops and has faced calls for a withdrawal timetable.

 Asked if British troops should not immediately withdraw, Reid referred the question to Jaafari, who said they should not.

 Solved: Phone bandits call mystery

 Washington, Nov. 16: Turns out, there really was somebody on the other end of the line.

 The cellphone bandit, who robbed four northern Virginia banks without missing a conversational beat, was talking to her boyfriend, who was acting as her lookout and getaway driver outside each bank, according to court records and law enforcement officials.

 Candice R. Martinez, arrested early yesterday in Centreville, and the boyfriend, Dave C. Williams, told investigators that they planned and carried out each of the Wachovia Bank holdups, according to authorities.

 Martinez, 19, a community college student from Santa Fe, New Mexico, was perhaps the USs best-known fugitive after police identified her as the woman in the nationally broadcast surveillance video of a November 4 holdup in Ashburn. While looking for Martinez, police targeted Williams, also 19, and picked him up on Monday night at an apartment in the Fairfax City area.

 Williams, a former Wachovia Bank employee, told investigators that he and Martinez plotted each robbery, starting with an October 12 holdup in Vienna, court records say. Martinez said she walked in, handed over a box with a note demanding $75,000, then stood at the window, chatting on her cell with Williams, who was outside in the getaway car, law enforcement officials said. They made off with $14,700.

 Then someone went on a spending spree, according to authorities.

 Detectives searching Martinezs Chantilly apartment found a $3,685.21 Circuit City receipt dated October 13 ? the day after the Vienna robbery, according to court records. Police found a Sony personal computer, a digital camera, a computer printer, three Louis Vuitton purses and the box for a T-Mobile cell phone. Circuit City is a store that sells electronic goods.

 Police said they also found two stacks of cash: packets of 30 $50 notes and 20 $100 notes still wrapped in Wachovia bands and dated October 18 and October 19, court records show. Also discovered were a white shirt and black tie, items the cell phone bandit was wearing in her final appearance, November 4 in Ashburn, police said.

 But it took two days to find Martinez. Police waited patiently outside her apartment in the Shenandoah Crossing complex on Route 50 in Chantilly. Hoping for help, they released her name to the public on Monday, having charged her with robberies in Fairfax and Loudoun counties.

 Martinezs father, Phillip Martinez, who lives in Santa Fe, seemed incredulous at his daughters arrest, saying he had sent her to Northern Virginia to get an education. It hurts too much right now, he said. One neighbour characterised Martinez as caring. Personally, I think the real story isnt that she robbed a couple of banks, the man said. She was someone with a good job, a car, going to school, a 19-year-old doing very well. The story is, How did this happen?

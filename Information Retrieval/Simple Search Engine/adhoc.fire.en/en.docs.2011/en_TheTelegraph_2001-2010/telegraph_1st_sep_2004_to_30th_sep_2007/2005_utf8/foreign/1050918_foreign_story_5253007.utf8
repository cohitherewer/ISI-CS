 Fine Print

 Couch record

 New York, Sept. 17 (AP): Couch potato, thy name is Suresh.

 Suresh Joachim broke the Guinness world record for the longest time spent watching TV. He finished yesterday with 69 hours and 48 minutes.

 After passing the previous record of 50 hours and 7 minutes on Thursday, Joachim continued until Friday morning.

 Joachim did his TV viewing in the lobby of a TV station as part of the Guinness World Record Breaker Week on the syndicated show Live With Regis and Kelly.

 Sitting on a brown leather couch, he watched nothing but ABC shows. Im going to be a little tired of watching TV after this, Joachim said during a brief break.

 Joachim, who lives in Toronto but hails from Sri Lanka, now holds more than 16 Guinness records. 

 Music style

 Mexico City (AP): Avril Lavigne loves 

 her Spanish-speaking audiences, but she plans to stick to 

 making music in English. Ill probably stick 

 to English. I understand it a lot better, the 20-year-old 

 singer, who was born in Canada, said before a recent performance 

 in the Mexican capital. Its the main language, 

 a lot of people understand it. Lavigne was in Mexico 

 to promote her new album Under My Skin.

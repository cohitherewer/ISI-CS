 Iron Ladys children at loggerheads

 AMIT ROY

 Carol (top) and Mark 

 Thatcher 

 London, Dec. 10: This is a story that may be of more than passing interest to the Ambani boys, Mukesh and Anil ? how Margaret Thatchers children, Mark and Carol, are no longer close. In fact, they do not even talk to each other.

 For many years, Carol was regarded as a so so journalist, while Mark was forever getting involved in dodgy business deals.

 Thatcher ? now Baroness Thatcher ? was once the most formidable politician in the western world who earned the nickname the Iron Lady, especially she took on the military men of Argentina at war and gave them a licking.

 Initially, she was wary of Indira Gandhi but later the two became close friends. But the two had another quality in common ? just as Gandhi had a blind spot about Sanjay, Thatcher, now a very frail 80-year-old, still remains a doting mother where Mark is concerned.

 However, in an exceptionally frank interview published today, Carol has revealed the extent of her split with her 52-year-old twin.

 Earlier this year, Mark was fined $500,000 after pleading guilty to being involved in an attempted coup in Equatorial Guinea. He was lucky to get away with a four-year suspended prison sentence in South Africa after his mother pulled some strings. 

 After Mark left South Africa, where he had set up residence, he could not follow his wife (from whom he is now divorced) and children to the US which has banned his entry. 

 There is new interest in Carol because she has just won a TV reality show called Im a Celebrity ?Get Me Out of Here!, which involves various endurance tests in the Australian jungle. 

 The British have warmed to her because she was seen relieving herself by her camp bed instead of finding discreet privacy behind a tree. But the tackier the programme, the higher its ratings tend to be in modern Britain.

 Thatcher was taken to hospital last week and kept overnight for observation. Although she left saying: Im fine, Im fine, Im fine, she is now a shadow of her former self.

 Carol told the Daily Mail: I was dismayed at the hurt and worry mum was suffering because of Marks involvement in the Equatorial Guinea plot. I was annoyed with my brother for getting embroiled in it, but my concern was our mother. I know how terribly it worried her, and in her state of health it was far from helpful to have such a nagging anxiety always at the back of her mind.

 She added: She didnt always remember what the charges against him were, but naturally people constantly asked about her about them, which didnt help. 

 She just sat and worried when she was on her own.

 She revealed that she was not close with her brother as they had quite different personalities and interests. 

 She said that she and her brother did not talk to each other and she did not even know where he was currently living, saying she would have to wait for a change of address card to arrive. 

 Carol defended her decision not to tell her mother she was taking part in the reality TV programme as she pointed out that Thatcher had a very poor short-term memory and would have forgotten about it almost immediately. 

 Her mother did not read much because she could not remember the beginning of the sentence by the time she reached the end, her daughter said. 

 The memory loss was incredibly frustrating for her mother, who in the past she said could quote inflation statistics going back years without reference to a note. 

 She also said her mother missed her late husband, Sir Denis, who died two years ago. 

 When youre with someone for 50 years they become literally your other half. I miss him too, Carol said.

 One of the few occasions when Thatcher was seen to be crying on television was back in 1982 when Mark went missing during a car rally in the Sahara desert. The

 nation did not share Thatchers joy when Mark was rescued.

 Paris killer fire, thrice in a week

 Paris, Sept. 4 (Reuters): A fire killed 14 people in a suspected arson attack in a high-rise apartment block in Paris today, the third major blaze in the French capital in just over a week, police said.

 Two children were among the victims, most of whom were killed by smoke and fumes, and at least 13 people were hurt in the low-cost 18-storey building in the southern suburbs of the capital, a police spokesman said.

 Officials said they suspected the fire was started deliberately in a letter box in the entrance of the building, and were looking for four young people whom witnesses saw in the hallway just before the blaze.

 Sources said three teenage girls had been questioned by police over the causes of the fire. The first indications point to a fire caused by a criminal act, said Patrick Seve, mayor of the LHay-les-Roses district where the fire broke out.

 Many victims were choked or suffocated by the fumes in extremely high temperatures after opening their doors. The people who stayed inside were fine. Its the people who rushed out and ran into temperatures of 300 degrees Celsius, smoke and asphyxia, that gave rise to the terrible toll, said deputy fire chief Alain Antonini.

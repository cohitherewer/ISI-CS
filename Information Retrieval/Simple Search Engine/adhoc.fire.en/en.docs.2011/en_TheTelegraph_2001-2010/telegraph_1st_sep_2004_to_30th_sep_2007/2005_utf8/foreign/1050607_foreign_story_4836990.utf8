 N. Korea, America meet

 New York, June 6 (Reuters): US and North Korean officials met in New York today for the first time in nearly a month after Washington urged Pyongyang to return to stalled talks on its nuclear weapons programme, a US official said.

 I can confirm that there was a meeting this morning between North Korea and the United States, said the official in Washington, who asked not to be named.

 The US was represented by Joseph DeTrani, the US special envoy to the six-party talks on North Koreas nuclear ambitions, and by Jim Foster, the director of the state departments Office of Korean Affairs, the official said. 

 There was no immediate word on who represented North Korea, whose mission had no immediate comment on the talks.

 No six-party talks have been held since June 2004. The six governments participating in those negotiations are China, Japan, South Korea and Russia in addition to North Korea and the US.

 North Korea requested todays face-to-face meeting last week.

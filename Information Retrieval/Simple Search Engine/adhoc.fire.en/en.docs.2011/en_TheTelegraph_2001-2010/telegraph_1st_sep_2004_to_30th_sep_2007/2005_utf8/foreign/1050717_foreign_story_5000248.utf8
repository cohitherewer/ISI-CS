 Crow song for Lance: Make em suffer

 Montpellier (France), July 16 (AP): If Sheryl Crow wrote a song about Lance Armstrong, the title would be simple and to the point: Make em suffer.

 His little boy (Luke) always says: Make em suffer daddy, so it definitely would incorporate that phrase, Crow said in an interview.

 The 43-year-old rocker is on her second Tour de France, and is relishing seeing boyfriend Armstrong power his way to what could be his seventh straight win. After todays 14th stage of the 23-day event, Armstrong held a commanding lead over his main rivals.

 Its one of the most inspiring events Ive been involved in, said Crow, who is putting the finishing touches on her new album, Wildflower. When you see the spirit of these guys, its crazy the lengths these riders go to. You know its got to be painful, but their heart drives them to be great... I love that seeking of greatness.

 Crow feels privileged to be able to peel back the curtains of the 102-year-old race.

 Im lucky, Im one of the only women I know of in the history of the Tour thats got to spend time with the team, she said. Breakfast with the team... then I speak to people or go to the bus and spend time with Lance. In the evening, he goes to massage and I go to exercise with a run or on the bike ... and then we eat dinner with the team.

 Despite rising early, spending hours on empty highways, smiling sweetly for countless fans and posing patiently for endless photos, Crow has found time to work on Wildflower.

 I didnt bring my guitar, because I already have more stuff than all the riders, she joked. I am working a lot during the day sequencing the record and picking mixes, videos. Now the busy work, its not the creative fun stuff.

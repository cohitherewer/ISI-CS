 Doubts over Pope recovery

 Vatican City, March 22 (Reuters): Pope John Paul?s recovery from throat surgery is going slower than hoped for, raising even more doubts over if and when he can resume normal activities, Vatican sources said today.

 ?Unfortunately, things are not going as well as we would have hoped,? a Vatican monsignor said. ?These are the ups and downs of post-operative convalescence for a man of his age and condition.?

 ?It is clear the Pope is suffering a lot,? said another cleric who works in the Vatican.

 Vatican sources said the 84-year-old Pope, who was last seen in public on Sunday, would have to miss this week?s Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession at the Colosseum on Good Friday, the day Christians commemorate Christ?s passion and death.

 The Pope, who also suffers from Parkinson?s Disease, had hoped to be able to attend the ritual. It was the only event during Holy Week, which ends next Sunday, that the Pope had not previously delegated to cardinals.

 The procession will instead be presided over by Cardinal Camillo Ruini, the Pope?s vicar for Rome. The Pontiff will watch on television.

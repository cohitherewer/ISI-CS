 Fine Print

 Scot sword

 New York, April 2 (Reuters): The sword used by Scottish independence hero William Wallace, known to many from the film Braveheart,? has left Scotland for the first time to join ?Tartan Day? celebrations in New York.

 ?The sword is a symbol, it?s a national icon in Scotland in the same way the original Declaration of Independence is a national icon in the US,? Colin ?Brien, Provost of the Scottish city of Stirling, said yesterday after its arrival in New York.

 Tartan Day ? which barely registers on the radar of most Scots ? was invented by the US Senate in 1998 to honour ?the outstanding contribution of millions of Scottish-Americans to our great nation.? 

 Tax trick

 Ottawa (Reuters): Canada?s top tax collector 

 had the citizens of Ottawa up in arms on Friday morning 

 when he announced a plan to force them to file their taxes 

 electronically if they wanted a refund before Christmas. 

 Revenue minister John McCallum said on a local CBC radio 

 show he was launching a pilot project in Ottawa called ?E-file 

 or Else,? with long delays and even a 5 per cent surcharge 

 for paper filers. This prompted calls voicing outrage because 

 some people do not have computers and in any case some had 

 already filed their tax returns. Before the early morning 

 programme went off the air, McCallum?s voice came on once 

 more: ?To all the taxpayers of Ottawa, April Fools? Day.?

 Sick ship

 Seattle (Reuters): A California woman and her son have sued cruise operator Holland America Line for unspecified damages after getting sick on a cruise where they said toilets overflowed and crew members were seen with prostitutes at ports of call. Bernice Oltman, 81, and her son, Jack Oltman, whose age was not given, said they took a trip on Holland America Line?s cruise ship Amsterdam from Valparaiso, Chile to San Diego, California, in March 2004, where they said they encountered unprofessional staff and unsanitary conditions.

 Erotic end

 London (Reuters): Organisers of a major 

 erotic festival are closing for business in Manchester due 

 to a lack of interest, which they blame on recalcitrant 

 northern English men. Erotica Manchester opened on Friday, 

 selling a range of sex aids, clothing and footwear, but 

 ticket sales have been poor and organisers say they will 

 not be coming back. ?We?ve tried to warm this city up for 

 more than two years but northerners just havent responded,? 

 said the event director.

 Unearthed: Cellar girls in east Europe meant for UK

 DAVID HARRISON

 London, Nov. 27: Young women are being imprisoned as sex slaves in secret underground bunkers before being trafficked to Britain, the Sunday Telegraph can reveal.

 Our investigation uncovered shocking evidence in eastern Europe, including video footage, of groups of women locked in squalid cellars below motels.

 The victims ? found by police in a series of raids ? were allowed out of the cramped bunkers only to service clients in nearby rooms before being taken straight back underground.

 The cellar girls were among thousands of young women lured to Macedonia from their native countries across eastern Europe by ruthless criminal gangs.

 Promised jobs as waitresses, au pairs or dancers, they are forced into prostitution before being sold.

 In a series of undercover investigations, the Sunday Telegraph has found that women can be bought for ?1,400 in Romania. They are among the victims of what has been described as medieval slavery in the 21st century.

 Many end up in Britain, enslaved by ruthless Albanian gangs who, according to Scotland Yard, now control almost all of Londons prostitution rings.

 Travelling last week to Macedonia to investigate reports of girl markets, we found evidence that girls were being sold, individually and in groups. Police video recordings revealed to us show young women from Romania, Moldova, Ukraine and Bulgaria emerging, dazed and frightened through hidden trapdoors.

 One clip shows a dank, windowless corridor which officers said led to a cellar with no lights or heating and with mattresses strewn over the dusty floor. Another shows another cellar and an attic where sex slaves were kept. 

 Western Macedonia has a mainly ethnic Albanian population and, with Kosovo and Albania, forms part of Europes biggest people-trafficking area.

 The traumatised women saved by police were taken to a shelter in the capital, Skopje, where they were given counselling and asked to provide evidence against the traffickers.

 A number of ethnic Albanians have been charged with trafficking and the women have gone home.

 A police spokesman in Skopje said: The people who can subject women to this medieval slavery in the 21st century are inhuman. They are sick.

 Growing concern about the tide of eastern European women being brought into Britain and forced into sexual slavery has prompted Tony Blair to declare war against people-traffickers.

 After being made aware last night of our investigation, he said: It is shocking. Some of these Eastern European gangs cover their attacks so well and the scale of their intimidation is colossal.

 Blair warned that the police and security services powers were not sufficient and that new measures would be brought in soon.

 These could include suspects being held without charge for longer than the 48-hour maximum.

 UK unions want short working week

 London, May 30 (Reuters): British trade unions today set out the case for a shorter working week, just days ahead of an EU meeting in which the government is expected to argue to keep the countrys opt-out from the European 48-hour maximum.

 The Trade Unions Congress (TUC) said it wanted to explode the myths that surround Britains culture of long-hours working.

 According to the TUC, employers have wrongly claimed that long hours do not have a detrimental affect on the health of workers, that those people who work long hours are happy to do so and that the economy needs people to work extra hours.

 The TUC argues that people who regularly work more than 48 hours a week tend to drink and smoke more and to adopt a poor diet against other workers.

 Evidence also indicates they are also likely to suffer an increased risk of heart disease, mental illness, diabetes and bowel problems, the TUC said. Britain is sometimes viewed as the sweatshop of Europe with people working hours more akin to those in the US than its EU neighbours.

 The average fulltime British employee works a 43.7- hour week ? longer than in any comparable country in the EU ? and EU ministers meet on June 2 to discuss an end to Britains opt-out.

 According to a government report, 58 per cent of long-hours workers would like a limit of 48 hours.

 Fine Print

 Pitt pitch pays off

 Los Angeles, June 11 (Reuters): Brad Pitts plea in a television interview this week for increased aid to poor countries and footage of him with children in Ethiopia are being credited with raising interest in a global anti-poverty campaign.

 Viewers may have tuned in to Tuesdays interview on ABC with Pitt hoping for some juicy tidbits about Angelina Jolie, co-star of his new movie Mr. and Mrs. Smith, but his humanitarian pitch apparently made a bigger impression. Since the Primetime Live broadcast, more than 120,000 people have gone online to sign a petition urging President Bush to pledge an additional 1 per cent of the US budget to humanitarian assistance and to prod fellow world leaders to follow suit, according to organisers of the One Campaign.

 The increase (in petitioners) was so dramatic that they are able to directly attribute it to Pitts TV appearance, One Campaign spokeswoman Jenny Volanakis said yesterday. 

 Slithering Spiderman

 Hong Kong (AP): A French urban climber 

 who calls himself Spiderman scaled a 62-storey 

 Hong Kong skyscraper barehanded on Saturday. Wearing only 

 a pair of red pants, Alain Robert, 42, from Valence, southeastern 

 France, scrambled up the downtown Cheung Kong centre ? the 

 flagship building of Hong Kongs richest man, Li Ka-Shing 

 ? in about an hour. Robert said the building was 283 metres 

 tall. During his climb, the Frenchman rested several times 

 and even answered a reporters phone calls. I 

 cant talk to you right now. Im climbing, 

 said Robert, renowned for scaling buildings without ropes 

 or other equipment.

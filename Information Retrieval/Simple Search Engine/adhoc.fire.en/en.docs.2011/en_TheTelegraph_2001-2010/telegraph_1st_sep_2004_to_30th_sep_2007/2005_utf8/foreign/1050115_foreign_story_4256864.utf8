 Kids drive parents like taxis: Survey

 PAUL MARSTON

 London, Jan. 14: Millions of parents spend large parts of their lives as unpaid chauffeurs, clocking up an average of nearly 5,000 miles a year driving their children to school, parties and leisure activities, according to a survey yesterday.

 Children?s trips were found to account for at least half of mothers? total annual mileage, while fathers also spent more time ferrying their offspring than on driving to social or sports events for themselves.

 The survey, carried out by pollsters ICM and Internet insurers Esure, assumed that transport for a child?s activity involved four journeys: a return trip to drop off and a repeat for collection. Parents reported that travel averaged 16 miles per event. Allowing for weekend or school holiday trips to friends? homes, sports clubs, music lessons, the cinema or other leisure activities, child-related driving was estimated at more than 4,700 miles a year costing more than ?700 in fuel.

 The study?s authors calculated that by the time a child reached their 17th birthday and became old enough to drive themselves, parents would have covered 80,000 miles on their behalf.

 According to the poll findings, the average car-driving mother spends 54 per cent of her total annual mileage on school runs, taxi support for children?s social lives and family shopping trips. Only 12 per cent of her driving is for personal purposes.

 For the typical father, a third of time on the road is for children twice as much as for his own pursuits. 

 Nearly two thirds of all parents in the nationally representative sample said they drove their sons and daughters to friends? houses, parties and sports events, half were involved in school runs and cinema trips. Many parents said they felt like a taxi service because often they were ferrying other parents? children as well as their own.

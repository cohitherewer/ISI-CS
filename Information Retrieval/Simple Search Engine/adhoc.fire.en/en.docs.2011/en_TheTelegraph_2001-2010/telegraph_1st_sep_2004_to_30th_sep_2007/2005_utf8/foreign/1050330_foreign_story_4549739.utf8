 Queen minus Mercury

 London, March 29 (Reuters): British rock band Queen has kicked off its first tour since the death of Freddie Mercury in 1991.

 Two of the original band members strutted the stage at a south London venue late yesterday accompanied by Paul Rodgers, the man handed the unenviable task of filling Freddie?s shoes. 

 The crowd did not seem to mind as Brian May on guitar and drummer Roger Taylor led them through classic anthems I Want to Break Free and Fat Bottomed Girls.

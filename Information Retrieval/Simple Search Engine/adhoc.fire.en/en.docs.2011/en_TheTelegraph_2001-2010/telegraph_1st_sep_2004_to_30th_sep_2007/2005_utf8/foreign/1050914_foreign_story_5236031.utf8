 Hooked rapist row

 Kleinmond (South Africa), Sept. 13 (AFP): A female condom-like device that latches on to a rapists penis with fish-tooth-like hooks is stirring controversy in South Africa, where the incidence of sexual assault is high.

 Called rapex, the latex device inserted in the vagina is the brainchild of South African Sonet Ehlers, who has been thinking about an anti-rape device since 1969, when she met a young rape victim. If you have seen a woman that has been raped, she is alive yet she is dead, Ehlers said at her home in Kleinmond, a holiday town some 120 km east of Cape Town. 

 My biggest drive is to help the woman out, says Ehlers, 57. Rapex attaches itself to the shaft of the penis and can only be removed by a surgeon, forcing a rapist to go to a hospital, where the crime would presumably be uncovered. This is not a tool to punish men, but a device to empower women, she said. 

 Aged advance in numbers

 Tokyo (PTI): Centenarians in Japan will 

 number a record 25,606 by the end of this month, surpassing 

 last years previous high by more than 2,568, the ministry 

 of health, labour and welfare said ahead of the Respect 

 for the Aged Day. Women continue to make up the vast 

 majority of centenarians, accounting for 85 per cent, and 

 topping 20,000 for the first time. For the first time, there 

 will be more than 20 centenarians per 100,000 people ? at 

 20.05 precisely ? making up one in every 5,000 people. Yone 

 Minagawa, a woman from Akaike is the oldest person in japan 

 at 112. The oldest man is 110-year-old Nijiro Tokuda.

 Cheney in testy Iraq

 Baghdad, Dec. 18 (Reuters): US vice-president Dick Cheney visited Iraq on Sunday for the first time since the 2003 invasion as hardline leaders from both sides of the countrys sectarian divide renewed calls for American troops to go home.

 Cheney, a chief architect of the war to oust Saddam Hussein, met Iraqs prime minister and president during his 8-hour visit, and hailed last Thursdays election as tremendous.

 But Saleh al-Mutlak, a Sunni Arab nationalist who stood in the parliamentary election and has spoken up for insurgent views, said Americans were not welcome in Iraq and should leave.

 His comments echoed those of outspoken Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who accused the Americans on Saturday of peddling their own agenda and disregarding Iraqis.

 A lull in violence around the largely peaceful vote was shattered by a bomb in a busy Baghdad market on Sunday which killed five people and injured at least seven. It exploded close to a Shia mosque, although it was unclear if that was the target.

 A suicide bomber killed one police officer in an attack in Baghdad and another blew himself up near the capital when his explosive belt detonated prematurely.

 Police in the northern city of Kirkuk said two relatives of a local Kurdish political leader were shot dead on Saturday. In Baghdad, police said a member of the Badr Brigades, a militia loyal to Iraqs biggest Shia party, was killed, also on Saturday.

 While neither Sadr nor Mutlak will head the next government, both are influential within their communities, and their dissent highlights the size of the task facing the next administration.

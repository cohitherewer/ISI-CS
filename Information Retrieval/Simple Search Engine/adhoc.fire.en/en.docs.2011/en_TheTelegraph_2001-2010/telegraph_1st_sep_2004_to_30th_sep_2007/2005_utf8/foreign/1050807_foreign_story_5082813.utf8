 Marilyns most secret thoughts

 Marilyn Monroe: Love lost

 Los Angeles, Aug. 5 (Reuters): Marilyn Monroe fretted over a relationship with then-attorney general Robert F. Kennedy and had a one-night stand with actor Joan Crawford that left her cold.

 Monroe also thought sex with former spouse and playwright Arthur Miller was just so-so and maintained a deep affection for ex-husband Joe DiMaggio. But she credited her psychiatrist with teaching her how to achieve orgasm. 

 The Los Angeles Times revealed a few glimpses into Monroes mind yesterday in excerpts of tape recordings the sex symbol and actor is said to have secretly made for her psychiatrist in the days before she died at the age of 36 in 1962. The Times said it obtained a written record of the tapes from the only person still alive who claims to have heard them ? former prosecutor John Miner, 86, who says the recordings support his belief Monroe was a victim of foul play. Miner took extensive and nearly verbatim notes from the tapes when they were played for him by Monroes therapist, Dr Ralph Greenson, now deceased, while Miner was investigating her death.

 Monroes body was found on August 5, 1962, in her Los Angeles home. An autopsy concluded she died of barbiturate poisoning, and the death was ruled a probable suicide. Conspiracy theories abounded for decades suggesting Monroe was murdered. Prosecutors re-examined the case in 1982 but decided there was insufficient evidence to warrant a new criminal investigation. Miner told the Times he examined the tapes in a bid to determine Monroes state of mind and came away believing the recordings showed the actor was anything but suicidal. According to excerpts, Monroe started off the recording ? a kind of self-analysis through free association ? by thanking her doctor for helping her regain control of myself, control of my life. 

 You are the only person who will ever know the most private, the most secret thoughts of Marilyn Monroe, she says.

 She also credits him for helping her unlock the secret to orgasm after years of unsatisfying sex, and goes on to dwell on the shape of her own body, her two famous former husbands, and her feelings toward such fellow stars as Clark Gable and Frank Sinatra, whom she called a wonderful friend.

 Of her sexual liaison with Joan Crawford, Monroe said: Next time I saw Crawford, she said she wanted another round. I told her straight-out I didnt much enjoy doing it with a woman. After I turned her down, she became spiteful.

 Although Monroe has long been rumoured to have had an affair with President John F. Kennedy, the tapes bear no evidence of that, the Times said. They do strongly suggest she and the Presidents brother, Robert, were involved romantically. There is no room in my life for him, she says. I guess I dont have the courage to face up to it and hurt him.

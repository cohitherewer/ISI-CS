 Visit fallout hurts Japan, China angry

 Tokyo, Oct. 18 (Reuters): Japan struggled with little success today to minimise the diplomatic fallout from Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumis visit to a Tokyo war shrine, which has outraged China and South Korea and upset domestic critics.

 Japans already chilly relations with its neighbours could go into a deep freeze following Koizumis pilgrimage yesterday to the Yasukuni shrine, where war criminals convicted by an Allied tribunal are honoured along with 2.5 million war dead.

 Koizumi ... paid his respects at Yasukuni as one Japanese citizen, defence minister Yoshinori Ohno told reporters. It is understandable that he went to mourn those who gave their lives for their country and to promise never to go to war again.

 In a sign of how tough that will be, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Kong Quan said a visit to Beijing by Japanese foreign minister Nobutaka Machimura had been called off. 

 Koizumi sidestepped questions on the overseas response. Whatever happens, our friendship with China will not change, he said, adding that he had considered things comprehensively before deciding to visit the shrine.

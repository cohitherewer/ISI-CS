 Shot at poll murder in Iraq shrine

 Najaf, Dec. 4 (Reuters): Iraqs former Prime Minister Iyad Allawi said gunmen tried to assassinate him in Shiite Islams holiest shrine today, forcing him to cut short an election campaign visit pursued by an angry mob. 

 It appeared to be an assassination attempt, the secular Shiite said, 60-70 men in black, armed with guns and knives, set upon his small party as he prayed at the Imam Ali mosque. 

 One took aim but dropped his gun, said the former US-backed premier, who is mounting a strong challenge to the ruling Shiite Islamist bloc in the run-up to the December 15 parliamentary vote.

 No independent account of the incident was available.

 Police said Allawis group was attacked by men with batons and fled the shrine under a hail of rocks, tomatoes and shoes ? the latter a mark of grave insult in Iraqi culture. Television images showed people running out as others threw sandals.

 Allawi, who seems to relish playing up to a tough-guy image and once barely survived an axe attack by agents of Saddam Hussein, refused to accuse any group directly. But broad hints that Shiite Islamists had a hand in it are likely to inflame an already bad-tempered campaign for the majority Shiite vote.

 In particular, aides said his assailants chanted support for followers of militant cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, whose black- uniformed Mehdi Army militia rose up in Najaf against Allawis government in 2004 before being crushed by US troops.

 We believe this was premeditated... it was very clear that they had evil intent to kill either the whole delegation or at least me, Allawi said. This man who dropped the gun appeared to be panicked when the gun fell from his hand.

 Referring to the killing in 2003 at the same mosque of a leading cleric, widely blamed on Sadrs movement, aides said the attackers chanted Sadrs name: It was the same chanting... linked to the martyrdom of Abdul Majeed al-Khoei, Allawi said.

 Some of Allawis guards and police fired in the air around the sprawling mosque complex as the politicians party ran for safety, police said. A colleague who was accompanying Allawi said he heard several shots but was unaware who had fired.

 Two police officers said they believed Sadrs supporters were responsible. When Allawi entered the shrine, a few people, believed to be Sadrists picked up batons and threatened to attack him, a captain said at the scene after the incident.

 Sadr aides were not immediately available for comment.

 Allawis electoral list includes several prominent Sunni Muslims and his promises to crack down on pro-government religious militias have won backing across the sectarian divide.

 We will punish these groups that terrify the Iraqi people and violate holy places, said Allawi, who last week accused the government of abusing human rights as badly as Saddam ? winning praise from the once dominant Sunni minority which complains that Islamist militias are running death squads against them.

 The government denied responsibility when US troops found dozens of maltreated Sunni prisoners last month in a secret interior ministry bunker in Baghdad.

 Prescott turns Patels guide

 London, Aug. 9: John Prescott broke off from running the country yesterday to show off his talents as a tour guide when he invited an Asian family into No. 10 Downing Street.

 The impromptu visit took place after the deputy Prime Minister noticed Pinakin Patel, his wife Premila and their three children, as he walked down Whitehall after a meeting in Downing Street.

 When he saw the Patels plucking up the courage to speak to him, he marched up to them himself and asked them if they would like a quick look round behind the most famous front door in Britain. The couple and their children were taken through the iron gates of Downing Street and went through a security check before being taken into No. 10. 

 Prescott, who is deputising for Tony Blair while the Prime Minister is on holiday, showed them the Cabinet Room, the White Room, which is often the setting for interviews, and the Grand Staircase, which is graced by portraits of all previous prime ministers. The family, from Harrow, northwest London, were then escorted out by Prescott.

 A spokesman said that Prescott had done the same for several other families in the past, offering off-the-cuff tours of Downing Street, his own offices and the House of Commons.

 ?Gonzo? scribe found dead

 London, Feb. 21: Hunter S Thompson, who pioneered gonzo journalism, has been found dead at his Colorado home with gunshot wounds.

 The author, who became a counterculture celebrity with works such as Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, is believed to have fatally shot himself. He was 67. Thompson was found dead at his home outside the ski resort of Aspen last night, police said.

 Thompson made his drug -fuelled antics and clashes with authority the central theme of his work, challenging the conventions of traditional journalism and creating a larger-than-life persona for himself. He dubbed his style of writing, which threw out any attempt at objectivity, gonzo journalism.

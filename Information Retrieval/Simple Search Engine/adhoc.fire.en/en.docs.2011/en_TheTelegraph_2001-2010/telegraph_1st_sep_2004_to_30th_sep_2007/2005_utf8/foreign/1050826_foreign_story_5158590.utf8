 Suicidal Mondays

 London, Aug. 25 (Reuters): Britons are more likely to commit suicide on Monday than any other day of the week, researchers said today.

 This is due not only to the Monday morning blues associated with a return to work but, more generally, to a sense of unease related to the start of something new, they said. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) collated evidence from nearly 35,000 suicide cases between 1993 and 2002. While Monday was usually the bleakest day of the week, the ONS found that the worst day for suicides in the 9-year period was January 1, 2000, a Saturday.

 Dutch doubts on Bank choice

 Brussels, March 20 (Reuters): The Netherlands today hinted at reservations about Washington?s nomination of Iraq war architect Paul Wolfowitz to head the World Bank, saying it would be better to have a wider field of candidates for the job.

 ?It is always elegant to have more than one candidate,? Dutch finance minister Gerrit Zalm said on arrival for a meeting with European Union counterparts. ?We now have to judge if he is a capable man.?

 The nomination of the deputy secretary of defence shocked many Europeans who know him only as a leading campaigner for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and an advocate of using US military power unilaterally. 

 No European government has spoken out openly against the choice but diplomats say many are uneasy, especially after the appointment of another hawk, former under secretary of state John Bolton, as US ambassador to the United Nations.

 Asked if he had qualms about Wolfowitz?s involvement in the Iraq war, Zalm said: ?No, that is not a reservation for us.?

 The views of European finance ministers matter because their representatives sit on the 24-seat board of the Washington-based institution which represents the 184 member states.

 The EU?s executive, the European Commission, has invited Wolfowitz to present his views on development and the role of the bank, which provides soft loans, policy advice and technical assistance to reduce poverty in low- and middle-income countries.

 Diplomats say the Europeans are unlikely to oppose Wolfowitz at a time when they are seeking to heal rifts with the administration of President George W. Bush.

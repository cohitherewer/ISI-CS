 Labour holds out economy bait for polls

 London, April 3 (Reuters): Britain?s governing Labour Party told voters today it would build on the country?s economic stability while its opponents would wreck it as Prime Minister Tony Blair prepared to call an election, expected on May 5.

 But Blair?s office ended speculation he would visit Queen Elizabeth tomorrow to seek the dissolution of parliament and unveil the poll date, saying the Prime Minister would attend vespers at Westminster Cathedral in memory of Pope John Paul.

 Parties are still gearing up for a May 5 vote and the election race in reality has been under way for months.

 Opinion polls point to a victory for the centre-left Labour Party but put Blair?s large parliamentary majority at risk.

 Anger over the Iraq war and voter disillusionment with the state of public services could slice support, analysts say.

 To combat that, Labour wants to convince voters it is the only party that can be trusted with the economy, arguing the opposition Conservatives would sabotage Britain?s sustained growth, low interest rates and low unemployment.

 ?Do you want to continue with a stable economy that is able to build on these achievements in the next few years, to make us an even stronger economy, and a more opportunity-driven economy, or do you want to return to the unstable, stop-go boom-bust days of the past?? finance minister Gordon Brown said today.

 Education was ?the driver of economic success? and was a number one priority for Labour, he told GMTV?s Sunday programme. Brown refused to rule out tax rises under a future Labour government but said Labour?s spending plans were fully costed.

 ?Labour wants to ... get the election on to its agenda of the economy and public services and create the impression that the momentum for improvement is with them and that the Conservatives would cause problems,? pollster Peter Kellner said.

 But Brown, who has moved centre-stage in Labour?s campaign in past days, cancelled a speech on Labour?s education spending plans out of respect for the Pope?s death and opposition parties called off events.

 Labour held on to its lead in a poll today. The survey by Communicate-Research for the Independent on Sunday gave Labour 40 per cent and the Conservatives 34 per cent. The Conservatives need a 10-point lead to topple Blair, analysts say. But Kellner forecast that Labour?s 161-strong parliamentary majority could tumble to 70, based on recent polls.

 With many Labour members of parliament in a defiant mood over Blair?s support for the US-led invasion of Iraq, a slimmer majority could hamper his future legislative plans.

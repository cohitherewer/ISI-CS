 Warm winter wakes up bears

 Tallinn (Estonia), Jan. 14 (Reuters): Estonia?s warmest winter for two centuries has woken some of its 600 bears several months early from hibernation, wildlife experts said today.

 The bears? early reappearance has raised concerns for the survival of this years cubs.

 ?It has been very warm and wet and many flooded rivers have forced bears out of their dens and out of hibernation,? said Kalev Manniste, a senior official at the Baltic country?s State Forest Service.

 ?Just a few days ago a hunter was telling me that he saw a she-bear with a very small cub walking across the field,? he said. 

 ?The cub the hunter saw looked too small to survive the winter.?

 She-bears normally give birth to tiny walnut-sized cubs during their winter hibernation and suckle them for months as they grow, before the spring thaw awakens the mother and she leaves her den.

 Local media and hunters writing on Internet sites say that across the country bears are moving about the forests at a time when they normally sleep and would not be seen for another two to three months.

 Temperatures have stayed above freezing, compared with the average temperature of minus 5 degrees Celsius for January.

 Neighbouring Russia?s normally ferocious winter has also been mild. Interfax news agency reported this week that a bear in a zoo awoke from hibernation two months early, while another did not go to sleep at all.

 About 3,000 polar bears live around the Arctic Barents Sea off northern Europe, according to a first census yesterday that sets a benchmark to judge bears? vulnerability to pollution and melting ice.

 The survey, by Russian, British and Norwegian researchers, showed that bear numbers in the region were at the bottom of previous rough estimates of 3,000-5,000. Still, ?a stock of 3,000 animals is relatively large in biological terms,? the Norwegian environment ministry said.

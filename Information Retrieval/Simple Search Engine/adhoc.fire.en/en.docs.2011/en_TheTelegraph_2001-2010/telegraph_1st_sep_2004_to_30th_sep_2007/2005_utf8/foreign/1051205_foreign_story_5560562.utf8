 Dhaka raid on terror

 Dhaka, Dec. 4 (Reuters): Police in Bangladesh today said they had detained nearly 50 suspected Islamist militants overnight, including 10 in the southeastern area of Coxs Bazar.

 Three militants were held in the northern district of Tangail during a gunbattle with police. No one was reported injured.

 The other detentions, carried out in areas across the country, took the number of suspects held in the past week to at least 180, the police said.

 Bangladesh has been hit by a wave of bombings since August 17, blamed on Islamist militants seeking to turn the mainly Muslim democracy into a Shariat-based Islamic state.

 In the past two weeks, suspected Islamists have launched suicide attacks on the judiciary, killing at least 20 people, including two judges, three lawyers and three policemen.

 We are going to broaden the hunt in the wake of continuing bomb attacks, finding of explosives and threats they are issuing to all sections of people, a senior police officer said. 

 They are sending letters to government and private offices, legal professionals, political activists, journalists and school teachers, threatening to kill them or blow them up. 

 Seven journalists had received death threats in the past few days. Some of the threats may be real, some are fake. But we have to take all threats seriously, the police officer said.

 State minister for home affairs Lutfuzzaman Babar said he had reports that two outlawed Islamist groups ? Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen and Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh ? had set up a 2,000-strong suicide squad to help achieve an Islamic state.

 Police said suspected suicide bombers had thrown a live grenade on Friday at a rally being addressed in northeastern Sylhet town by Badruddin Ahmed Qamran, the citys mayor and district head of the main Opposition party, the Awami League.

 It failed to explode and bomb experts later defused it.

 On Saturday evening, police recovered apowerful bomb in a tiffin (lunch) box at Dhakas Gabtali bus station at a time when hundreds of people were thronging the area.

 We believe the explosive device, weighing about 2 kilograms and hidden in a tiffin carrier, was a time bomb, a senior police officer in Dhaka said, without giving details.

 Sheikh Hasina, head of the Awami League, told reporters on Sunday that shelargely blamed the government for the spreading Islamist militancy in impoverished Bangladesh, home to 140 million people.

 Hasina reaffirmed her rejection of Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zias call for a crisis dialogue.

 The remote control (of bombings) is in the hands of the government, which has ultra-radical Islamic parties in its ruling coalition, she said.

 So, we cannot sit or talk with this government to discuss terrorism or anything, the former prime minister said. (Additional reporting by Mohammad Nurul Islam in Coxs Bazar)

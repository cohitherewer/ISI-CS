 Heidi heads back to her roots

 KATE CONNOLLY

 Berlin, July 23: Heidi, one of the worlds best-known childrens book characters, is being taken back to her roots in a British-Swiss multi-million pound co-production for the stage.

 Heidi: The Musical returns the Alpine heroine to the mountains in which her creator, Johanna Spyri, found her inspiration for Switzerlands most celebrated female, 125 years ago. Gone is the hipster image, which many films and modern productions for film and stage have tried to give her in recent years. Gone too are the blonde tresses ? as she was portrayed by Shirley Temple in the 1930s ? which the Nazis exploited to promote their idea of Aryan perfection.

 It has been replaced by a grittier version, which is much truer to Spyris novel, and portrays an earnest, brown haired girl who tries to win over her grumpy grandfather, a mercenary turned hermit.

 A British writer and composer have been brought on board in an attempt to reinvigorate a story which over the past 30 years in Swiss hands, has slid into the realm of clich?s and kitsch. Heidis name has been given to everything from milk and theme-parks to mineral water and high-speed trains.

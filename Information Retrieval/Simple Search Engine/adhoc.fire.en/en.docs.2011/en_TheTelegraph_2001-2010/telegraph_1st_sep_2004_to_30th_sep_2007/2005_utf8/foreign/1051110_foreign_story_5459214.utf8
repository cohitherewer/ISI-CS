 Arnie defeated on bad night for Republicans

 San Francisco, Nov. 9 (Reuters): California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger lost his bid to push through a broad package of government reforms in a special election today that he called in an attempt to flex his political muscles.

 With more than 85 per cent of the votes counted, Schwarzenegger trailed on all four of the initiatives he had championed, and four other measures also appeared to have lost.

 As a result, the most expensive special election in California history ? at least $300 million including advertising and administering the poll ? appeared to have failed to change public policy and left the Republican governor wounded a year ahead of his re-election bid.

 In the two gubernatorial races yesterday, Democrats made a dual sweep in Virginia and New Jersey, dealing a setback to Republicans and President George W. Bush ahead of critical congressional elections next year.

 In Virginia, Democrat Tim Kaine handily defeated Republican Jerry Kilgore despite Bushs 11th-hour appearance on Kilgores behalf. Democratic Senator Jon Corzine beat Republican businessman Doug Forrester in a bitter New Jersey race.

 The only big Republican win came in normally Democratic New York, where Republican mayor Michael Bloomberg sailed to re-election after spending as much as $100 million of his own fortune to defeat Democrat Fernando Ferrer.

 Facing a slate of disappointing numbers, Schwarzenegger appeared before his supporters in Beverly Hills and pledged to work with Democratic leaders in Sacramento.

 I also recognise that we also need more bipartisan cooperation to make that all happen. And I promise that I will deliver that, he said. The people of California are sick and tired of all the fighting and they are sick and tired of all those negative TV ads.

 He said he would meet legislative leaders in the state capital tomorrow before a planned trip to China. 

 We are going to go and find common ground. We are going to talk about reforms, he said.

 Analysts say that working with Democrats, the states dominant party, will prove key to the moderate Republicans political future. As recently as Monday his aides predicted the governor would win at least three of his four propositions. 

 Usually politicians can find some silver lining. There is no silver lining tonight for Arnold Schwarzenegger, said Tony Quinn, co-editor of the California Target Book, a journal tracking state campaigns.

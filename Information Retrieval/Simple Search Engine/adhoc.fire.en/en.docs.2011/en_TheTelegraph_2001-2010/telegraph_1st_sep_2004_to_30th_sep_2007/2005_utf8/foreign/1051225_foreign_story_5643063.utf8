 US mosques on radiation watch

 Washington, Dec. 24 (Reuters): US officials have secretly monitored radiation levels at Muslim sites, including mosques and private homes, since September 11, 2001, as part of a top secret program searching for nuclear bombs, US News and World Report said yesterday.

 The news magazine said in its online edition that the far-reaching programme covered more than a hundred sites in the Washington, DC, area and at least five other cities.

 In numerous cases, the monitoring required investigators to go on to the property under surveillance, although no search warrants or court orders were ever obtained, according to those with knowledge of the programme, the magazine said.

 The report comes a week after revelations that the Bush administration had authorised eavesdropping on people in the US. President George W. Bush has defended that covert programme and vowed to continue the practice, saying it was vital to protect the country.

 Senior US officials, including FBI director Robert Mueller, have repeatedly said Islamic militants appeared intent on acquiring weapons of mass destruction for an attack against the US.

 Mueller said in February he was very concerned with the growing body of sensitive reporting that continues to show al Qaidas clear intention to obtain and ultimately use some form of chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear or high-energy explosives material in its attacks against America.

 An FBI spokesman declined to confirm or deny the US News and World Report article and said: We cant talk about a classified programme.

 The FBIs overriding priority is to prevent, disrupt and defeat terrorist operations in the US. All investigations and operations conducted by the FBI are intelligence driven and predicted on specific information about potential criminal acts or terrorist threats, and are conducted in strict conformance with federal law, he added.

 The Council on American-Islamic Relations advocacy group said the report, coupled with news of the domestic eavesdropping, could lead to the perception that we are no longer a nation ruled by law, but instead one in which fear trumps constitutional rights.

 All Americans should be concerned about the apparent trend toward a two-tiered system of justice, with full rights for most citizens, and another diminished set of rights for Muslims, it said.

 Federal officials cited by US News and World Report maintained the programme was legal and said warrants were not needed for the kind of radiation sampling it conducted. Officials also rejected any notion that the programme specifically targeted Muslims.

 According to US News and World Report, the nuclear surveillance programme began in early 2002 and has been run by the FBI and the department of energys Nuclear Emergency Support Team. At its peak, the effort involved three vehicles in the Washington area monitoring 120 sites a day, nearly all of them Muslim targets such as prominent mosques and office buildings selected by the FBI, it said.

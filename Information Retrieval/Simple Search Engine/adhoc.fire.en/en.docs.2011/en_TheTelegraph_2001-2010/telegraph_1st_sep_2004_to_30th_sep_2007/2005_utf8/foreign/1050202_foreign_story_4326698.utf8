 Fine Print

 Skinned support 

 London, Feb. 1 (Reuters): Looking for a unique way to support the fight against animal abuse?

 The British founder of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta), the world?s biggest animal rights group, is auctioning off a lizard tattoo on her right arm ? with proceeds going to the charity. Billed as ?waterproof and weathered? and ?suitable for making into a wallet or watch strap?, the tattoo is being offered on website eBay to draw attention to the plight suffered by skinned animals.

 ?It?s the only skin you can wear and use with the express permission of the original owner,? said Ingrid Newkirk of her tattoo.

 ?Euphemisms like ?leather? and ?meat? help mask the cruelty that goes into stealing and slaughtering for clothing, trinkets and taste ... It may be uncomfortable to contemplate, but we?re all flesh and blood,? she said today.

 The purchase price will be donated to Peta?s ?Shed Your Skin? campaign, which promotes alternatives to leather and exotic animal skins. But the winning bidder might have a long wait getting hold of the tattoo: it will only be delivered after its owner has passed away.

 Marley jam

 Marley fans and Rastafarians gathered in the Ethiopian capital

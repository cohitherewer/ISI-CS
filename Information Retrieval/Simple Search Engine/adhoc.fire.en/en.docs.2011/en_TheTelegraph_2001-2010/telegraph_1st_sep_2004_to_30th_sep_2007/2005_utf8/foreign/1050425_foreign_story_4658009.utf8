 Beijing begins talks on HK laws

 Hong Kong, April 24 (Reuters): Beijing today began a discussion of Hong Kong?s leadership succession laws while hundreds of protesters in the territory denounced it as unwarranted interference in internal affairs.

 Carrying placards, several hundred demonstrators marched through the main shopping belt on Hong Kong island chanting: ?Against Beijing?s Parliament?s interpretation of the law?.

 The Standing Committee of China?s parliament, the National People?s Congress, kicked off several days of meetings with a reading of a draft ruling on the interpretation of Hong Kong?s constitution, state media reported. The draft, which the Committee is expected to pass by Wednesday, said the next chief executive should only serve the remaining two years, until mid-2007, of the term of former leader Tung Chee-hwa.

 The constitution of the former British colony says any chief executive should serve five years and many people, especially Hong Kong?s lawyers, see Beijing?s move as meddling.

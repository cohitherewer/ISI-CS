 Iraq govt within days

 Baghdad, April 24 (Reuters): Iraqi leaders will announce a government within days and no one from caretaker Prime Minister Iyad Allawi?s party will be in the cabinet, lawmakers and people involved in the negotiations said today.

 ?Allawi will take no part, his party will have no ministries,? a senior official involved in the talks said, adding the decision had been taken after another round of negotiations yesterday that lasted more than 10 hours. ?There are still some details to be worked out, but the announcement of the cabinet should be made by Monday,? he said.

 Politicians have repeatedly said in recent weeks that they are on the cusp of unveiling a government, only for the announcement to fall through. Prime Minister-designate Ibrahim Jaafari theoretically has until May 7 to form a cabinet.

 Talks have been going on for nearly three months, since elections on January 30. The delays have frustrated Iraqis and contributed to a resurgence in guerrilla violence, US and Iraqi officials say.

 Thaer al-Naqib, Allawi?s spokesperson, said if members of Allawi?s party were not included in the cabinet, he would still support the government. Allawi, whose party won 40 of the 275 seats in parliament, had said he would only participate if his party got four ministries, including either the defence or interior post. 

 Baghdad blast

 Two bombs exploded near a Shia mosque in Baghdad today, killing at least 15 people, a police official said. He said 57 people were also wounded at the Ahl al-Beit mosque. The official said a roadside bomb exploded and then a suicide bomber in a car blew himself up beside a crowd that gathered to inspect damage from the first blast.

 Europeans under sunbed tan shadow

 Geneva, March 17 (Reuters): The World Health Organisation (WHO), warned young Europeans today that their taste for getting a tan even before they hit the beach could result in an ?epidemic? of skin cancer within a decade.

 WHO said sunbeds and sunlamps, popular with many tanning-obsessed Europeans, should be banned for under-18s and avoided by everybody else because of their link to cancer. ?We don?t want to see an epidemic of skin cancers coming along some 10 years down the road,? Michael Repacholi, coordinator of WHO?s radiation and health programme, said.

 ?We recommend that you don?t use sunbeds. If you want to, there are a set of rules that we have identified that you should adhere to,? he said, adding people should be supervised and use goggles to protect their eyes.

 Recent studies have shown a direct link between ultraviolet radiation emitted by sunbeds and sunlamps and skin cancers, prompting the WHO to call for stricter controls on their use. Some 25 per cent of sunbed users in northern Europe are aged between 16 and 24, making them the target audience for the warning, Repacholi said.

 Regular sunbed use may cause disfigurement from removal of skin cancers and early death if the cancer is a malignant melanoma, the UN agency said, adding it would also add substantial costs to national health systems.

 Promoted by an unregulated, multibillion dollar industry, tanning devices in commercial studios are popular among whites.

 Young females, many fair-skinned, often turn to ?all-over tan?, clam-shaped sunbeds ahead of a beach holiday.

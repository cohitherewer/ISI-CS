 Attack as Iraq House meets

 Baghdad, March 16 (Reuters): Iraq?s new parliament met for the first time today more than six weeks after it was elected, but rival blocs were unable to agree on a government and insurgents attacked the meeting with a mortar barrage.

 Windows rattled in the fortified Green Zone compound where officials had gathered for the parliament meeting as the mortars struck, but no casualties were reported.

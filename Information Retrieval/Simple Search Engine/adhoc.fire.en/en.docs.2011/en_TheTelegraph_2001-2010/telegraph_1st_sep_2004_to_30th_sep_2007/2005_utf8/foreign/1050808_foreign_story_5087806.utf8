 Snap amp; shoot

 Britney

 Malibu (California), Aug. 7 (AP): A photographer was shot in the leg with a pellet gun outside Britney Spearss home, authorities said.

 The photographer was outside Spearss long driveway, staking out an event at the Malibu home, when someone shot at him, Steve Smith of sheriffs department said.

 Firefighters treated the man, identified as Brad Diaz, with a small bandage and he went to a hospital, Smith said.

 It was unclear who fired the plastic pellet or whether Spears was home at the time, Smith said. Diaz was about 200 metres from the residence.

 It couldve been somebody driving by, walking by, we have no idea where it came from, he said.

 A message left with Spearss publicist was not immediately returned last night.

 Tower of terror

 Islamabad, Oct. 8 (AFP): At 8.50 am (9.20 am IST) today many residents in the upscale Margala Towers apartment block here were enjoying the chance to sleep in after a hectic working week.

 Minutes later a monster earthquake had transformed the plush 10-storey building to a heap of rubble and twisted metal ? while two other towers on either side stood undamaged.

 We all rushed out of our houses, people were in their pyjamas and many women there were without slippers and without their dupatta, said Sajida Burki, who lives in one of the towers left standing.

 We saw people rushing to a balcony on the other building but while it was still rocking it crashed down and the occupants came down with the mass of the concrete.

 Dust-covered survivors could be seen pinned under huge concrete slabs and cries for help floated from the wreckage as mechanical diggers lifted chunks of the destroyed building. There were screams of women and children, many are still trapped inside and we can hear cries. Its a tragic scene, Burki said.

 I have just seen another body being pulled out, the place is devastated, an AFP photographer said.

 The complex is in the fashionable F-10 sector of Islamabad and many foreigners, including Japanese, Italians and Arabs, had rented the flats as they were considered relatively safe. The complex has some 250 apartments.

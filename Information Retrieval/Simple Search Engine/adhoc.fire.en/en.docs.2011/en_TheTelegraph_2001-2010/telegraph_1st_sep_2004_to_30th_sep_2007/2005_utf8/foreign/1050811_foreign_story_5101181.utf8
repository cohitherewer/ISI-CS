 Daring Pak mountain rescue

 Islamabad, Aug. 10 (Reuters): Army helicopters plucked a stranded Slovenian climber from one of Pakistans tallest and most dangerous mountains today in a daring high-altitude rescue, a military official said.

 Two helicopters, battling thin air at altitudes above their normal operating ceiling, winched Tomaz Humar off an icy ledge high on a face of the 8,125 metre Nanga Parbat mountain in the Pakistani Himalayas. He is absolutely all right, military spokesman Colonel Atique Rehman said of Humar, who got stranded at 6,347 metres while attempting a solo ascent of the worlds ninth highest mountain.

 Two army Lama helicopters set off early today and succeeded in lowering a sling to Humar and pulling him up and away. They were operating 311 metres, or about 800 feet, above their normal ceiling, Rehman said.

 China harassment law

 Beijing, Aug. 28 (Reuters): China today outlawed sexual harassment and pledged to improve womens poor representation in politics to help make good on a national policy of equality between the sexes.

 Mao Zedong famously declared that women hold up half the sky but in modern China they face challenges at all stages of life ranging from illegal sex-selective abortions ? by couples who discover they are expecting a girl and would prefer a boy ? to a preference for men in many jobs.

 In a recent survey only 21 per cent of women said they had never faced sexual harassment, the official Xinhua news agency reported.

 The new policies were part of an amendment to the law on the protection of womens rights, passed by the standing committee of Chinas parliament, the National Peoples Congress (NPC).

 It is the first time we have written rules against sexual harassment into law, because it is a concern of society, Xin Chunying, deputy director of the standing committees legal work commission, told a news conference.

 She gave no details on what would be considered sexual harassment, however, saying it was hard to define clearly, and could not say what punishment there would be.

 The new law also aims to expand womens presence in public life.

 The state will adopt measures to gradually enhance the ratio of women participating in the NPC as well as the local congresses, a draft of the law released by Xinhua said.

 There are very few women in the very top ranks of government, and none sitting on the partys all-powerful nine-member Politburo Standing Committee. 

 They account for around 20 per cent of NPC delegates, and less than a fifth of Communist Party members.

 Xin did not say what the new target ratios would be or how they would be achieved.

 Trump call to rebuild NY towers

 Donald Trump: Combative

 New York, May 19: Donald Trump, New Yorks most flamboyant businessman, pitched into the growing row over the future of the World Trade Centre site yesterday by championing a rival proposal to simply reincarnate the Twin Towers.

 Trump described the existing multi-billion dollar plans for the Freedom Tower as a pile of junk. He called for the erection of a slightly taller and much stronger version of the towers that were destroyed on September 11, 2001.

 The multi-millionaire property developer and television presenter said the Freedom Tower, based on a design by the architect Daniel Libeskind which was chosen after an international competition, was nothing more than a skeleton that was not appropriate for Manhattan, not for the US and not for freedom.

 If the proposed 1,776 feet-tall building, whose twisted form and distinctive spire are intended to reflect the Statue of Libertys upraised arm, was built, the terrorists win ? its that bad, he said.

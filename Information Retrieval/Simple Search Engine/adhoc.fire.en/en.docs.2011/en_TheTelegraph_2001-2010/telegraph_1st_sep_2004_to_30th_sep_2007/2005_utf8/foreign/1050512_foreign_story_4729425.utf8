 Baghdad, May 11 (Reuters): Four suicide bombs killed at least 71 people in Iraq today, the latest attacks in an escalating campaign of guerrilla violence that has killed nearly 400 Iraqis since a new government was unveiled two weeks ago.

 In Saddam Husseins hometown of Tikrit, a suicide car bomber blew up his vehicle among a crowd of mainly Shia migrant labourers from southern Iraq who had gathered to look for work. Police said at least 33 people were killed and 80 wounded.

 A policeman at the scene of the blast in Tikrit, 175 km north of Baghdad, said the explosion was near a police station but the target was the crowd of workers.

 What I saw was a tragedy, said Ibrahim Mohammed, a migrant worker from the town of Kut who witnessed the blast. Some people had their heads torn off by the explosion, some were burned, some were ripped to pieces.

 Iraqi militant group Army of Ansar al-Sunna claimed responsibility for the bombing in an Internet statement.

 Mainly Sunni guerrillas have often targeted Shias, sparking fears they are trying to stoke sectarian civil war.

 In the town of Hawija, southwest of the strategic oil city of Kirkuk in northern Iraq, a suicide bomber walked up to an army recruitment centre and detonated an explosive belt, killing at least 32 people and wounding 34, hospital sources said.

 A third suicide bomber blew up his vehicle near a police station in the southern Baghdad suburb of Dora, killing at least three civilians. Police said the bomber was trying to reach the police station but blew up his car before he got there.

 Insurgents have launched a blitz of attacks since Iraqs political leaders announced a new cabinet on April 28.

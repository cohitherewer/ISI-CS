 Juvenile joy ride

 Detroit, Feb. 9 (Reuters): A four-year-old Michigan boy took underage driving to new extremes by slipping behind the wheel of his mother?s car for an overnight visit to the local video store.

 Nile Hayden, mayor of the small town of Sand Lake in the southwest corner of the state, said the boy?s ?joy ride,? which ended with more than one fender bender, occurred about 1.30 am last Friday.

 He drove about half-a-kilometre from his home to the video store without incident, Hayden said. The store was closed. On the boy?s return home, he hit two parked vehicles before backing up into a police cruiser, Hayden said.

 ?Once the officers got him out of the car and sat him on the hood of our car, he started crying and saying: ?I want to go into the house. I want to go back to bed,?? Hayden said.

 Hayden said the boy was unaware of the seriousness of what he had done. ?How many four-year-olds get up and wander around the house or go out (at night)?? he added.

 ?What he was doing was jump down, hit the accelerator, and get back up so he could see where he was going,? Hayden said, explaining how someone who was too short to reach the floor pedals was able to drive a car.

 Triple trick

 Harare (Reuters): Zimbabwe police have 

 charged a man with masquerading as a female athlete after 

 he competed as a woman at several international sports events, 

 the official Herald newspaper said. The paper said 

 the man, a triple jumper and runner who also competed at 

 javelin and shot put, faced charges of impersonation and 

 offending the dignity of a woman athlete who undressed in 

 his presence not realising he was a man. He won a gold medal 

 at a tournament in Botswana last June. The man told the 

 court that he had been born with both female and male organs, 

 and that he lived as a woman after consulting a traditional 

 healer.

 Blair win forecast with majority trim

 London, April 10 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair heralded the release of his Labour Party?s election policies as campaigning hit full swing today and polls showed he was on track to secure a third term in power.

 ?We will publish our manifesto this week,? Blair told supporters in his home constituency of Sedgefield in northern England. ?If you value economic stability you have to vote for it.?

 Three polls today showed Blair should win his third successive election on May 5, a first for a Labour Premier. But the estimates ranged from a lead of 7 percentage points to a slim 2 points over the opposition Conservatives.

 All the forecasts would trim Labour?s 161-seat parliamentary majority but still give Blair a comfortable cushion of seats.

 The parties launched into the first full week of campaigning after political leaders flew to Rome on Friday for Pope John Paul?s funeral and then attended the wedding of heir to the throne Prince Charles to Camilla Parker Bowles yesterday.

 Labour?s manifesto will focus on continued economic stability, driving unemployment down further and investing in public services, while restating its accusation that the Conservatives would cut public spending by ?35 billion.

 The Conservatives will promise to raise spending on health and education and offer modest tax cuts.

 A commitment not to raise rates of personal income tax ? a centrepiece of Blair?s 1997 and 2001 election victories ? is expected to be repeated by Labour but a broader pledge not to hike any taxes will probably be absent.

 Economists say the government?s spending programme will require higher taxes at some point after the election, an analysis Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown hotly denies.

 Blair said today education remained his priority and pledged more teachers, free pre-school education, an end to high-fat, unhealthy school meals and a drive to get children fit.

 Whatever the policies, Blair may already have taken his most important step ? last week he all but promised Brown, who has presided over eight years of solid growth, will remain in post if Labour wins again, halting a feud that has bubbled for years.

 Pollsters say if the top two in British politics are fully in tandem, voters are more likely to return to the Labour fold.

 Financial markets had been unsettled by rumours that Blair would move Brown from the treasury if he secured a big majority.

 To stress the point, the pair took the unusual step of giving a joint interview to the News of the World tabloid.

 Blair compared his bond with the finance minister to a marriage, saying: ?The basic belief that motivates the two of us is the same. You come into the Labour Party because you believe in a fairer society.?

 The duo will also star in Labour?s first election broadcast tomorrow as the party machine goes into overdrive after a faltering start when the Conservatives made the running.

 Brown remains favourite to be Britain?s next Premier.

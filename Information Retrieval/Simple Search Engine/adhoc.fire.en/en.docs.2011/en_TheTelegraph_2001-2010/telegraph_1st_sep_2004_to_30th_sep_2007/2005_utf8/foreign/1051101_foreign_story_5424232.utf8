 Would-be citizens face Britishness test

 AMIT ROY

 London, Oct 31: Foreigners who want to apply for British nationality will have to pass a Britishness test from tomorrow, the home office announced today.

 Out of 24 multiple choice questions, candidates will have to get three-quarters right before being eligible to apply for British nationality.

 The idea, which has gained momentum after the London bombings of June 7, is to create a society in which people feel proud to belong to Britain.

 Tony McNulty, Tony Blairs immigration minister, said today: Becoming a British citizen is a milestone event in an individuals life.

 He explained: The measures we are introducing today will help new citizens to gain a greater appreciation of the civic and political dimension of British citizenship and, in particular to understanding the rights and responsibilities that come with the acquisition of British citizenship.

 While urging people to become more British, the government has pursued policies which is having the opposite effect. 

 It is allowing the setting up of faith schools, mainly Muslim, within the state system.

 Their supporters have argued that if Christians and Jews can have their own schools, Muslims, too, should be allowed the same right. While this argument has intellectual force, it does encourage children to grow up without developing natural friendships with pupils from other faiths.

 There are a couple of Hindu schools and a Sikh one is in the pipeline. But Hindus and Sikhs seem less enthusiastic about sending their children to faith schools. On the other hand, a whole generation of Indian immigrants, mainly women, has lived in Britain for more than 30 years without bothering to learn English. The same is true of Pakistanis, notably Mirpuris, in Bradford and other cities in Yorkshire and the West Midlands.

 As for the Britishness test, foreigners will have to pay ?34 to sit the 45-minute exam, which can be taken at any one of 90 centres through the country. Those who fail can take the computer-based exam again and again. 

 The Life in the UK test, based on a handbook, is intended to examine a candidates knowledge of everyday life in the country in such areas as British regional accents, the Church of England, the courts and the telephone system.

 Sample questions revealed today are of the type: 

 Where are the Geordie, 

 Cockney, and Scouse dialects spoken? What are MPs? What 

 is the Church of England and who is its head? 

 What is the Queens 

 official role and what ceremonial duties does she have? 

 Do many children live in single parent families or step-families?

 Which of these courts uses 

 a jury system? 

 Magistrates Court? 

 Crown Court? 

 Youth Court? 

 County Court.

 Is the statement below 

 true or false? 

 Your employer can dismiss you for joining a trade union.

 Which two telephone numbers 

 can be used to dial the emergency services?

 112?

 123?

 555? 

 999?

 Which of these statements 

 is correct? 

 A television licence is required for each television in a home. 

 A single television licence covers all televisions in a home.

 (Answers to the last four questions are: 

 1. Crown Court

 2. False

 3. 112 and 999

 4. A single television licence covers all televisions in a home)

 Last year more than 110,000 people were awarded British citizenship, according to the home office.

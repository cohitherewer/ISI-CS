 Lanka hawk wins election

 Colombo, Nov. 18 (Reuters): Sri Lankas hawkish Prime Minister, Mahinda Rajapakse, won the islands presidency today after a Tamil Tiger boycott torpedoed his main rival, and vowed to forge an honourable peace with the rebels.

 Yesterdays poll was seen as a referendum on how to rescue the islands faltering peace process and tsunami-hit economy, but the rebels scared away ethnic Tamil voters who had been expected to back Opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe.

 Analysts suspect the Tigers are using a 2002 ceasefire that halted two decades of civil war to regroup and rearm. They say the Tigers called for a poll boycott to damage the chances of the more moderate Wickremesinghe to buy time to push for a separate homeland. Without the boycott, Wickremesinghe could well have won.

 I will bring about an honourable peace to the country, respecting all communities, Rajapakse said after the election commissioner confirmed his victory.

 Democracy will be strengthened and law and order will be established in the country, he added. For me, power is not an ornament, but a means to serve the people.

 Rajapakse polled 4,887,152 votes, or 50.29 per cent of the vote, and Wickremesinghe 4,706,366 votes or 48.43 per cent. The two were separated by just 180,786 votes, but over half a million Tamils in the north and east, many of whom were expected to back Wickremesinghe, stayed away.

 Wickremesinghes camp demanded a partial repeat of the vote in areas affected by the boycott, but the islands elections commissioner rejected the request and government officials said Rajapakse would be sworn in as President tomorrow.

 Left-winger Rajapakse has allied himself with hardline Marxists and nationalists from the mainly Buddhist Sinhalese majority who detest the Tigers. He rejects the rebels demand for a separate homeland for minority Tamils, wants to tighten the terms of the truce and pledges anational economy.

 Baghdad, April 22 (Reuters): A car bomb blew up outside a Shia mosque in Baghdad as prayers were ending today, killing 10 people and wounding 15, Iraqi police said.

 The explosion occurred outside the al-Subeih mosque in the eastern New Baghdad district of the capital. ?I was rushing to the mosque in my car for Friday prayers when I heard a big blast,? a witness told Reuters Television.

 ?I ran inside and started carrying the bodies of those who were killed. My clothes were covered in blood.?

 A wall of the building appeared to have been knocked down by the power of the blast and a water cistern inside the mosque burst, soaking the floor. Blood mixed with the water forming large red pools.

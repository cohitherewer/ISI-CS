 Economics Nobel for no-war theory

 - American 

 amp; Israeli share prize

 Stockholm, Oct. 10 (Reuters): An American and an Israeli won the 2005 Nobel prize for economics today for their work on game theory, which can help explain and resolve trade and business conflicts, and even play a role in avoiding war.

 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences gave the $1.3-million prize to Thomas Schelling and Robert Aumann for work that has found uses in security and disarmament policies, price formation on markets, as well as economic and political negotiations.

 Aumann, 75, was born in Germany but is an Israeli and US citizen who teaches at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Schelling, 84, teaches at the University of Maryland.

 Game theory is the science of strategy and attempts to determine what actions different players ? such as trading partners, employers, unions or even organised crime groups ? should take to secure the best outcome for themselves.

 Game theory work has won the Nobel before. John Nash, the mathematician whose life was portrayed in the movie A Beautiful Mind, won the economics prize with two others in 1994.

 I think game theory creates ideas that are important in solving and approaching conflict in general, Aumann told the awards ceremony by telephone from Israel.

 Asked whether it could help solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, he said: I do hope that perhaps some game theory can be used and be part of this solution.

 Schelling said by telephone from his home in Maryland that he was glad to have his work recognised.

 Im a student of cooperation and conflict, Im not really a game theorist...I would not try very hard to make the case that what I do is economics, he said.

 Schelling, whose career began with work on the US Marshall Plan to help rebuild Europe after World War II, has applied game theory to global security and the Cold War arms race.

 In particular, he has tried to explain how a taboo around nuclear weapons after the bombing of Hiroshima in 1945 itself became a factor in deterring their use after World War II, even as both sides of the Cold War amassed big nuclear arsenals.

 Aumann was cited for his analysis of infinitely repeated games to identify what outcomes can be maintained over time. 

 He told a news conference in Jerusalem that game theory had become a cornerstone of economics worldwide.

 This is a badge of honour for this branch of science, for game theory, he added.

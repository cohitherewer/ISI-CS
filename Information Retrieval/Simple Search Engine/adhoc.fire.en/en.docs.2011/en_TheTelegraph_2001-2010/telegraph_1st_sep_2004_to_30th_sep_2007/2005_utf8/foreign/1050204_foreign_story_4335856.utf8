 Boy for Blunkett lover

 Kimberly Quinn

London, Feb. 3 (Reuters): The former lover of ex-British home secretary David Blunkett, who tearfully resigned after he was accused of abusing his position to help her, has given birth to a son, newspapers reported today.

 Kimberly Quinn had a planned caesarean delivery at a London hospital yesterday with her husband Stephen by her side, The Daily Mail reported.

 It raises the prospect of a custody battle between the Quinns and Blunkett, who is involved in legal proceedings over the paternity of Kimberly Quinn?s first child, two-year-old William.

 Stephen Quinn, publisher of Vogue magazine, declined to reveal the name of the baby, newspapers said. ?Everything is fine, it is a great day,? he was quoted as saying in The Daily Mail. ?It is best for me not to say too much.?

 Blunkett resigned his post in December after newspaper stories about his affair with Quinn, his paternity claims over her son and allegations he abused his office to help her nanny get a visa.

 An inquiry into the visa scandal found Blunkett intervened in the nanny?s application, but concluded it was unclear whether he meant to act improperly.

 Moneypenny not in picture

 London, Oct. 16: She has waved 007 off on some of his most perilous missions, but time has finally run out for Miss Moneypenny.

 The producers of the new James Bond film, Casino Royale, which will star Daniel Craig as the secret agent, revealed last night that her character will not feature in the ?70 million adaptation.

 The decision to axe Moneypenny, who appears fleetingly in Ian Flemings original novel, is the biggest indication yet that the film will deviate substantially from the spirit of previous Bond outings.

 Although it was widely known that Samantha Bond, who has played the character in the last four films, was not going to reprise the role, it had been assumed that someone else would take over, with the actor Camilla Power, 29, being linked to the part. Michael G. Wilson, who co-produces the Bond franchise with his step-sister, Barbara Broccoli, confirmed Moneypennys departure.

 Neither Miss Moneypenny nor Q will appear. Neither of them are in the book. The film will update the novel but stick very closely to the storyline. In the story, Bond is just joining the service.

 The claim will surprise fans, not least because Moneypenny is clearly mentioned in Flemings original: Miss Moneypenny would have been desirable but for eyes which were cool and direct and quizzical, he wrote.

 Apart from Samantha Bond, Moneypenny has been played in the official 007 series, which stretches from Dr No in 1962 to Die Another Day 40 years later, by Lois Maxwell and Caroline Bliss. 

 Fleming is thought to have modelled the Moneypenny character on Vera Atkins, the former assistant to Maurice Buckmaster, the head of the French section at the Special Operation Executive. Although Moneypenny has moved with the times, she has always been portrayed as having a secret yearning for 007.

 Wilson confirmed that the new film, which is due to be released next year, will be darker than its predecessors and would be closer to the books.

 In particular, there had to be less emphasis on stunts and gadgets.

 Victim fearful after release of rapists

 Mukhtaran Mai

 Meerwala (Pakistan), March 16 (Reuters): The victim of a notorious gangrape in Pakistan said today she was living in fear of her life after four men convicted of the crime were released from jail.

 The men were freed from prison in the central town of Dera Ghazi Khan yesterday, pending a Supreme Court hearing of different appeals arising from their conviction for the 2002 crime and subsequent acquittal.

 An anti-terrorism court sentenced six men to death in 2002 for the gangrape of Mukhtaran Mai ? four for carrying out the rape and two who sat on a village council that ordered it to assuage the honour of a powerful tribal family. The case provoked an outcry in Pakistan and drew international attention to the plight of women in the country.

 Speaking to Reuters at her home in the village of Meerwala in the central province of Punjab, Mai broke down in tears at the release of the four men, saying she was losing hope of justice. ?My heart is broken and I have no desire to live,? she said.

 Mai had pleaded against the release of the men ahead of their appeal and said she now feared for her safety, having received threats from the powerful Mastoi tribe to which they belong. ?We have been threatened that we will be killed, we have been told that they will make us disappear from the area,? she said.

 A legal controversy over the case erupted when a high court in the central city of Multan overturned the anti-terrorism court ruling and acquitted five of the six due to lack of evidence and commuted the death sentence of the sixth to life imprisonment.

 Days later, the federal shariat court, Pakistan?s highest Islamic tribunal, threw out the Multan judgment, saying the high court had no jurisdiction. The Supreme Court then intervened, suspending further proceedings of both the shariat court and Multan High Court and saying it would hear appeals and counter appeals against the rulings.

 The Supreme Court has yet to set a date for the hearing.

 The original trial heard that Mai?s rape was ordered by the village council as punishment for her brother?s suspected affair with a woman from the Mastoi tribe. 

 Just 6 km away in the home village of the four men, hundreds of fellow members of the Mastoi tribe celebrated their release and proclaimed their innocence, some performing traditional dances and banging drums.

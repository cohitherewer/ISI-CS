 Jobs boost to compete with India

 London, April 28 (PTI): Britain plans to boost job skills and entrepreneurship to help the country compete effectively with India, China and other nations, Prime Minister Tony Blair said today.

 Unveiling the ruling Labour Party?s manifesto here, Blair said if voted to power, his party would set-up a ?manufacturing skills academy as part of plans to help thousands of firms over the next five years and to increase the number of apprenticeships across britain to 300,000.?

 Blair said Britain had never worked so productively, created so much wealth and generated so many jobs.

 But he warned that the world was changing rapidly and countries such as India and China were now competing with Britain on skills as well as costs. 

 ?Between them, these two countries produce 125,000 computer science graduates every year ? more than twice the whole of the European Union,? he said.

 The prime minister said british businesses could compete internationally and his government would work to ensure economic stability was maintained.

 Describing brown as the best chancellor for decades, the prime minister said he would try to maintain a competitive tax regime and reduce the burden of regulation.

 Replying to a question on britains entry into a european single currency, blair said prior to that the economic tests had to be met. (more) pti hsr kim 04282001 del

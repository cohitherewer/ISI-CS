 Phone stopper

 Blue Springs (Missouri), Dec. 24 (AP): It was a conversation stopper.

 A lovers dispute over a cellphone took a serious turn early yesterday morning when the woman ended the spat by swallowing the phone. Police said they received a call at 4.52 am (local time) from a man who said his girlfriend was having trouble breathing. When they arrived at the house they found the 24-year-old woman had a cellphone lodged in her throat.

 He wanted the phone and she wouldnt give it to him, so she attempted to swallow it, detective Steve Decker of the Blue Springs police department said yesterday. She just put the entire phone in her mouth so he couldnt get it.

 Police said an ambulance transported the woman to St Marys Medical Center in Blue Springs. A hospital spokeswoman said she could not give details about the womans health since police have not released her identity.

 Decker said police had closed investigations on the swallowing case. This is the first Ive heard of this happening. I dont know what kind of phone it was. I dont know if it was on ring or vibrate, either, said Decker.

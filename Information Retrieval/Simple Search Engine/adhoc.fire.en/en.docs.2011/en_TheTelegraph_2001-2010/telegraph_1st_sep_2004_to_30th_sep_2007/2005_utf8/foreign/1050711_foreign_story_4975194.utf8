 Telecom firms told to store mails

 London, July 10 (Reuters): British police have asked mobile phone and Internet companies to store the content of voicemails, emails and SMS text messages that were in their systems on the day of the London bombings, a police source said today.

 He said it was only the second time they had issued such a request. The first was in the wake of the September 11 attacks on the US in 2001.

 But police have no legal authority to force the companies to store the information, and some have said they cannot meet the request for technical reasons, the source said. The idea is to stop stuff thats going to be important to the investigation disappearing.

 Over the next few weeks, as the Metropolitan Police identify suspects, theyll want to investigate who theyve been communicating with and so on. So t he action is to make sure that data isnt deleted routinely by the companies over that intervening period.

 Such information normally vanishes from the systems of telecoms companies as soon as users have listened to their voicemail messages or download their emails, the source said. 

 This meant that companies which complied with the request would probably be able to retrieve the content of messages only from last Wednesday and Thursday.

 Earlier, British interior minister Charles Clarke said London would seek new EU rules to make telecom firms store records for much longer.

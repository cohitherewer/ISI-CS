 Pope plea on tech triumph

 Vatican City, Dec. 25 (Reuters): Pope Benedict, in his first Christmas address, today urged humanity to unite against terrorism, poverty and environmental blight and called for a new world order to correct economic imbalances.

 The Pope made his comments to tens of thousands of pilgrims gathered under umbrellas in a rainy St Peter square for his Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) message and blessing.

 In his address, telecast live from the central balcony of St Peters Basilica to nearly 40 countries, he also urged his listeners not to let technological achievements blind them to true human values.

 He said humanity should look to the Christ child for encouragement in times of difficulty and fear. A united humanity will be able to confront the many troubling problems of the present time: from the menace of terrorism to the humiliating poverty... from the proliferation of weapons to the pandemics and the environmental destruction which threatens the future of our planet, he said in Italilan.

 The address by the leader of the worlds some 1.1 billion Roman Catholics was different in style than those of his predecessor John Paul.

 John Paul wrote his Christmas addresses in free-style verse and resembled poetry, whereas Benedicts was in prose like a normal homily or speech. After the address, Benedict wished the world a Happy Christmas in 33 languages. His predecessor sometimes used twice as many languages on Christmas.

 Since his election, the Pope has repeatedly reminded Catholics not to give in to an ethical relativism where circumstances can be used to justify actions that should be considered wrong in all cases.

 The Pope, wearing a gold cape and with a gold mitre, continued in that line today by focusing on the dangers of technology and progress.

 Today we can dispose of vast material resources. But the men and women in our technological age risk becoming victims of their own intellectual and technical achievements, ending up in spiritual barrenness and emptiness of heart, he said.

 That is why it is so important for us to open our minds and hearts to the birth of Christ, this event of salvation which can give new hope to the life of each human being.

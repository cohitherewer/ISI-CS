 New Orleans prepared

 New Orleans, Sept. 21 (Reuters): New Orleans residents prepared to evacuate again yesterday as Hurricane Rita headed toward the Gulf of Mexico, but the residents who have trickled back since Katrinas devastation vowed to stay.

 Mayor Ray Nagin, whose plan to bring residents home had been questioned by President George W. Bush, suspended plans to bring people into the city and urged everyone to leave ahead of Hurricane Rita, which he warned could once again swamp levees that collapsed and flooded the city three weeks ago.

 But the hardy souls who either rode out Katrina here or have come home to mud-soaked, damaged houses despite a lack of drinking water and electricity were reluctant to leave.

 Im staying. I dont think (Ritas) headed here, said Scott Hound Peterson, 37.

 With Rita looming, Louisiana declared a state of emergency and New Orleans was taking no chances. Mayor Ray Nagin said two busloads of people had been evacuated already and 500 other buses were ready to roll. Were a lot smarter this time around, he said.

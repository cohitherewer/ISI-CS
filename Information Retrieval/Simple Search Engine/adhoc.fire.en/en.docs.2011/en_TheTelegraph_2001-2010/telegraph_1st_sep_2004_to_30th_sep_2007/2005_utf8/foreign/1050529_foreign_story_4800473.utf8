 Poll gives boost to Hillary 2008 run hopes

 ALEC RUSSELL

 Hillary Clinton

 Washington, May 28: Hillary Clinton, one of Americas most prominent and yet polarising politicians, received two fillips yesterday to boost her supporters hopes that she is the Democrats best chance to take back the White House.

 An opinion poll has for the first time indicated that a majority of Americans would be likely to vote for the former First Lady. 

 Hillary, now a senator for New York, had significantly broadened her support in the past two years, according to the Gallup poll, apparently reflecting her shift to the centre on key domestic and foreign policy issues. Fuelling her supporters delight, a former aide was acquitted in court last night of under-reporting the cost of a fund-raising reception for her 2000 Senate campaign.

 David Rosen stood accused of trying to circumvent Americas complicated campaign finance laws by masking the true costs of the event in order to free up more money for her campaign. Hillary was not charged and did not testify, but the case was closely watched by the Republican Right wing for ammunition.

 It was also monitored by Democratic powerbrokers who remain wary that Hillary may yet be too polarising a figure to be their 2008 presidential candidate. Her image in the heartland never recovered from a disdainful remark she made on the campaign trail in 1992 about stay-at-home mothers, and also from her role in a botched liberal attempt to reform Americas health care.

 Marriage mends

 Former President Bill Clintons role as campaign sage for his wifes 2000 senate run helped mend a marriage torn by the former Presidents affair with an intern, according to a new book.

 Women want to know why you stayed with me the former President asked Hillary Clinton in front of aides before her bid for a New York Senate seat, according to a new biography Survivor by journalist John Harris.

 Yes, Ive been wondering that myself, she replied, sparking a reply from her husband which emerged as a theme of her campaign. Because youre a sticker! thats what people need to know ? you are a sticker. You stick at the things you care about, Clinton said according to the book.

 The most comprehensive account yet of the 1993-2001 Clinton presidency, other than books penned by both Clintons, Survivor takes its own stab at the mystery of the Clinton marriage.

 Harris writes, citing people who worked and socialised with the Clintons, that their love was genuine and overcame rough patches because it was rooted in a mutual obsession ? politics. 

 The 2000 Senate campaign provided a project upon which they could rebuild their marriage and remind themselves anew what it was that drew them to each other, writes Harris, a Washington Post reporter who covered the Clinton White House. 

 Asked by CNN whether she could pledge that she would serve out her Senate term if re-elected, or whether she would pursue a White House run in 2008, Clinton declined to say. 

 I am focused on winning re-election, she said. My view is that life unfolds in its own rhythm.

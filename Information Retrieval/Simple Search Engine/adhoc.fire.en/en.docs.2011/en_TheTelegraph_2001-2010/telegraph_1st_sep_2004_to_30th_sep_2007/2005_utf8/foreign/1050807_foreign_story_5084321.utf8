 Russia tries to rescue stuck mini-sub

 Moscow, Aug. 6 (Reuters): Russia raced today to haul up a mini-submarine stuck 190 metres underwater near its Pacific coast, before the seven sailors on board run out of air.

 We have today, perhaps tomorrow, deputy chief naval staff, Rear Admiral Vladimir Pepelyaev told Russian television.

 Britain and the US flew unmanned undersea rescue vehicles to the far east Kamchatka peninsula to help with the accident, which has revived grim memories of a botched attempt to save sinking Russian nuclear submarine Kursk five years ago.

 The AS-28 mini-submarine, itself a rescue vessel, has been stranded since Thursday, when its propeller got tangled up in wires from the antenna of a military underwater monitoring device, during military exercises.

 The first attempt early today to drag the mini-sub to shallow waters failed.

 Itar-Tass news agency quoted naval spokesman Igor Dygalo as saying a new attempt had started to try and pull up the AS-28, together with antenna, cable and two heavy anchors holding it.

 Two rescue ships caught the whole thing in a loop and have started pulling them up, Dygalo said. The vessel will be raised to a depth of 30-50 metres .

 It was not clear how long the operation might last. There have also been conflicting reports about whether the rescuers want to take the AS-28 to the surface, or evacuate the crew when the submersible rises to the safe depth of 100 metres.

 At Russias request, a British Scorpio and three US Super Scorpio underwater rescue vehicles were airlifted to Kamchatka earlier today, loaded on ships and sent to join the operation. Interfax news agency quoted Pacific Fleet commander, Admiral Viktor Fyodorov, as saying that they would only get there by 2000 GMT.

 The coastal waters off Russias far east have highly sensitive installations and there were suggestions the military was not keen to have foreign navies getting so close to its secrets.

 This area is stuffed with secrets, Interfax news agency quoted retired Admiral Eduard Baltin, former Black Sea Fleet commander, as saying. It is home for strategic nuclear submarines ... and a route of secret communication table.

 They could as well invited the whole of Nato, he added.

 And deputy chief naval staff Pepelyaev told RIA news agency that Russia could try to do without foreign help.

 There is no such need at the moment, he said, referring to the prospect of sending down US divers in special suits that allow them to go to great depths. At home, the AS-28 incident has become a reminder of the Kursk disaster five years ago and which led to fierce criticism of President Vladimir Putin.

 All 118 men on board the Kursk, which sank in the Barents Sea, died after a botched rescue. Very much like it was five years ago, the naval command was slow in reporting the incident and then insisted for a long time that the sailors had enough air and food, that there was good communications with them, the newspaper Kommersant wrote.

 Very much as with the Kursk, direct work to save the submersible started more than a day after the incident occurred, it added.

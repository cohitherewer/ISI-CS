 For Katrina victims, stars build shelter from storm

 Alicia Keys 

 Jennifer Aniston: 

 Heartfelt 

 Los Angeles, Sept. 7 (Reuters): Sheryl Crow, the Dixie Chicks, Randy Newman, Neil Young, Rod Stewart, Alicia Keys and Paul Simon will perform at Fridays Hurricane Katrina benefit organised by the major broadcast networks.

 Shelter From the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast, a live, hour-long telecast, will be carried commercial-free by more than two dozen other cable outlets. 

 In addition to raising money for victims of Hurricane Katrina, the event will pay tribute to the rescue and recovery workers who have an arduous task ahead in cleaning up the devastated regions in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.

 Cable networks confirmed to participate in the telecast include ABC Family, Bravo, E!, TBS, USA Network, FX and Oxygen.

 Jennifer Aniston, Ellen DeGeneres, Ray Romano, Jack Nicholson, Cameron Diaz, Sela Ward and Chris Rock are among the celebrities slated to appear on the telecast, to be executive produced by Joel Gallen, who directed many of the same artists four years ago when he executive produced the post-September 11 America: A Tribute to Heroes telethon, which was also telecast across dozens of media outlets.

 The Shelter special also will be carried widely in more than 95 countries, including most of Europe, the UK and Asia. The Big Four networks have yet to specify where the donations raised through the telethon will be sent.

 The special will originate from Sony studio facilities in Los Angeles and New York. 

 Jackson single

 Pop star Michael Jackson has written a song for the victims of Hurricane Katrina that he hopes to record with other top artists and release as a charity single, his spokeswoman said today.

 Jackson, who raised more than $60 million for African famine relief with a campaign built around his anthem We Are the World, was moved by the images of Katrinas destruction that he saw on television, publicist Raymone Bain said. It pains me to watch the human suffering taking place in the Gulf region of my country, Jackson said in a written statement. My heart and prayers go out to every individual who has had to endure the pain and suffering caused by this tragedy.

 He added: I will be reaching out to others within the music industry to join me in helping bring relief and hope to these resilient people who have lost everything.

 Bain said Jackson had already composed the song, tentatively titled: From the Bottom of My Heart, and planned to record it within two weeks after enlisting other top performers.

 In the next 24 hours he will be personally reaching out to all of the artists to ask them to join him in this project, Bain said, adding that none of the participants could yet be identified.

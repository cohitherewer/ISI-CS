 Suspects family fear extradition

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 London, July 30: The family of Haroon Rashid Aswat, 30, a Briton from Yorkshire who is apparently being held in Zambia, said today they feared the Americans were seeking his extradition to the US.

 It has been reported that although Aswat was born in Yorkshire, his fathers family originated in India. The Americans want to question him about his alleged plans to set up an al Qaida training camp in Oregon. 

 In a statement released today Aswats family said: We are extremely concerned, distressed and disappointed by the attitude of the British government and the FCO (Foreign and Commonwealth Office) in not providing consular access to Haroon.

 It is very worrying that after more than 10 days the British government is still unable to verify that the British citizen detained is actually Haroon.

 It added: Our son, albeit estranged for many years, is surely entitled to the presumption of innocence as any other British citizen. Press reports are reporting unnamed British officials in discussions with the US government over extradition of Haroon yet our government and the FCO is dilly dallying and does not have the decency to confirm Haroons detention. We wonder whether the governments attitude would have been any different if it was a white, non-Muslim citizen detained in a foreign country?

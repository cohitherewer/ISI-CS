 Harry?s secret reunion

 Prince Harry

London, Feb. 26: Prince Harry has flown his 

girlfriend Chelsy Davy to England for a secret reunion, a media report said today. 

 The 19-year-old student has just spent more than a fortnight with the prince, who described her as ?his first true love?.

 Harry has been under virtual house arrest at his father?s Highgrove home since the outcry over his decision to wear a Nazi uniform to a party last month. 

 He is under pressure to keep a low profile and had to put plans to visit Chelsy in Cape Town on hold but has sought permission to meet her here, the Daily Mail tabloid said. 

 To protect their privacy, the couple swore their close friends to secrecy. But it has emerged that Chelsy left South Africa on February 2, flying from Johannesburg to Heathrow. 

 While in England she stayed with several close friends who she knew could be trusted, returning to South Africa on February 17, in time to return to college, the report said. 

 It is not known whether she was allowed to stay over with the prince at Highgrove but the trip did enable the couple to spend Valentine?s Day together, it said. 

 Several reports had earlier suggested Harry had ended the affair because his family did not feel that party-loving Chelsy was suitable for him. 

Monarchy damage

 The monarchy has been seriously damaged by the litany of errors overshadowing the coming wedding of Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, a YouGov poll shows today.

 Less than a third of the population now believe that the prince should become king. A further quarter went as far as to say that the monarchy should end when the Queen retires or dies.

 More than a third of those who took part said the prince?s marriage would weaken the monarchy. Only five per cent believed that it could strengthen it.

 Fine Print

 Brash beer

 Berlin, Sept. 9 (Reuters): A German brewer has concocted what he says is the worlds strongest beer, a potent drink with an alcohol content of 25.4 per cent that is served in a shot glass.

 Everyone who has tried it is enthusiastic. It tastes like a quirky mixture of beer and sherry, said Bavarian brewer Harald Schneider.

 Schneider, who lives in southern Germany where beer is a tradition, said his beer fermented for 12 weeks for an alcohol content twice that of Germanys other strongest beers.

 People will only be able to drink two or three glasses, he said. Schneider expects the holders of the worlds strongest beer, the Boston Beer Company, to put up a fight.

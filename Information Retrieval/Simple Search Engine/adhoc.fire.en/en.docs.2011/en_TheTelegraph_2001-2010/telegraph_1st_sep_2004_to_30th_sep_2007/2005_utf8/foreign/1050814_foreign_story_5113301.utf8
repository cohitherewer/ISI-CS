 The cruise missiles successful test is a major mile-stone in Pakistans quest for strengthening and consolidating our minimum deterrence, quot; he said while addressing army corps commanders in Rawalpindi.Musharraf said the HATF-VII test is a great boost to Pakistans defence capabilities. Pakistani scientists had test-fired the nuclear capable HATF-VII on Thursday. 

 This is the second missile test in the last five months by Pakistan, which plans to launch serial production of the missiles from next month. In March, Pakistan had test-fired the long range, ballistic missile Shaheen-II.

 Do-gooder power ladies in AIDS fight

 Washington, Sept. 29 (AP): Angelina, Condoleezza and Hillary combined their considerable star power to cast a spotlight on the international effort to fight HIV and AIDS.

 For one night, the campaign against HIV trumped the buzz over Senator Hillary Rodham Clintons re-election bid, speculation over whether secretary of state Condoleezza Rice will run for president, even gossip about Angelina Jolies relationship with Brad Pitt. The women were all speakers at a dinner of the global business coalition on HIV-AIDS, helping raise $1.3 million.

 Volkswagen of South Africa, Getty Images, MAC Cosmetics, Bristol-Myers-Squibb, Virgin United and De Beers were honoured for their work against AIDS. While the women went out of their way to praise each other, Clinton drew loud applause when she called on the Bush administration and Congress to recognise the importance of condoms in the fight against AIDS.

 There is a great deal of political pressure to only talk about abstinence, and to deny support for condoms and education on using them, Clinton said. 

 She said girls and women were increasingly at risk, especially in the countries most affected. Earlier, Rice told the crowd at the Kennedy Center that the involvement of businesses along with government is crucial in fighting AIDS, which she said can threaten the stability of countries and entire regions.

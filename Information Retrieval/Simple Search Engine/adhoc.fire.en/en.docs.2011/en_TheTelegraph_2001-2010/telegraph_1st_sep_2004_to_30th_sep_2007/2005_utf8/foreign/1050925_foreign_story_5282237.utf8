 Problems for President Davis

 Davis: Juggling roles

 Los Angeles, Sept. 24 (Reuters): A new TV show starring Oscar-winner Geena Davis as Americas first female President, juggling career and family while holding Republican enemies at bay, is drawing Internet fire from conservatives and feminists alike.

 But the big question among network executives is whether there is room enough in prime time for two White House dramas. Commander In Chief premieres on Tuesday on ABC following the return tomorrow of NBCs Emmy-winning White House drama The West Wing.

 Producers of Commander In Chief acknowledge their success depends on distinguishing their show from West Wing, which is headed into its seventh season with a storyline pitting Alan Alda against Jimmy Smits in an election battle to replace current star Martin Sheen as President.

 Much also will hinge on how well Davis, whose two previous network TV series flopped, can carry off her latest role as a leader of the free world who remains very much a mom. Aside from the obvious gender differences of its stars, Commander and West Wing differ in politics and tone.

 Commander dwells on the private life of the first family, while West Wing focuses as much on the Presidents close aides as on the top guy.

 Sheens character, President Josiah Jed Bartlet, is a veteran Democrat in the twilight of his second term. The commander in chief Davis plays, Mackenzie Allen, is a political independent.

 Its certainly the role with the most gravitas that Ive had to play, said Davis, who won an Oscar for her supporting role in The Accidental Tourist, but is better known for her star turns in Thelma amp; Louise and Stuart Little movies.

 Demonising that shows leading Republican is almost sure to turn off conservative viewers, some of whom already see the show as the work of liberal Hollywood preparing the nation for a Hillary Clinton presidency in 2008, according to Stacey Lynn Koerner, director for ad-buying agency Initiative.

 Negative advance Internet buzz about the show was revealed in a recent survey of online chat rooms and discussion boards conducted by Initiative Media.

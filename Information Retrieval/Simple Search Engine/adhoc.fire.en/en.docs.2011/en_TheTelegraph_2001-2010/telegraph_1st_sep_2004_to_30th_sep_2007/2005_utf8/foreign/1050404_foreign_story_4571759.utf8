 Echo award for Anastacia

 Anastacia

 Berlin, April 3 (Reuters): American singer Anastacia won the German music industry?s Echo award yesterday for the best international pop/rock female artist, edging out Nelly Furtado, Norah Jones, Avril Lavigne and Katie Melua. 

 ?It?s been a dream year for me,? said Anastacia, 31, who has long been a favourite in Germany and sold more than 1 million albums here in the last year. She won her first Echo, which is seen as the world?s most important music industry prize after the Grammys and Brits, four years ago.

 Nominations for the awards were based on sales in Germany.

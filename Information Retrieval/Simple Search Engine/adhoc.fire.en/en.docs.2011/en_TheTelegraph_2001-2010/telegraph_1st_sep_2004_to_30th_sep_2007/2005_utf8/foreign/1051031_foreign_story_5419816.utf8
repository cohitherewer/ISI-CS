 British MP in oil scandal

 George Galloway: Slippery tract

 Washington/London, Oct. 30: British MP George Galloway is facing a new legal battle over claims that he benefited from Saddam Husseins manipulation of the UN oil-for-food programme after it was revealed that prosecutors in the US are to consider criminal charges. 

 Evidence purportedly showing that cash was funnelled into accounts belonging to the MPs wife and his charity, the Mariam Appeal, will be put before the US justice department. 

 Senator Norm Coleman said he will send details of what he calls a convincing case within days. The senate report claims to document evidence that $150,000 in oil profits had been paid into the account of Galloways wife, Amineh Abu-Zayyad, by a Jordanian businessman who was their friend. 

 Coleman claims that his allegations are based on testimony given by Tariq Aziz. But Galloway said after meeting lawyers acting for Aziz that the former Iraqi foreign minister flatly denies saying that he benefited from oil deals. 

 The allegations were completely false and part of a grand lie against him. Ron McKay, a friend of and spokesman for Galloway, said: George demands to be charged and if there are no charges brought then it will display the paucity of the case. 

 On the question of his wife, who he has split up with, they have always maintained separate bank accounts. 

 He knew that she was raising funds for her work as a research scientist into the causes of childhood cancer but he has absolutely no knowledge of these alleged payments. 

 At the start of all this he was accused of taking millions of dollars of kickbacks and now at what is hopefully the end of this process no one has proved he has accepted a single penny. 

 If (Coleman) wants to get into personal vituperation about motives and honour, I think he ought to look in the mirror.

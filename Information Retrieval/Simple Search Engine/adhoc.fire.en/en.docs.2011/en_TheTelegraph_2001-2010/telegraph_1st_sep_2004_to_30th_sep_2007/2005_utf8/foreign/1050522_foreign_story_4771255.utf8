 Castro yes leads to rebel meet

 Havana, May 21 (Reuters): President Fidel Castros communist government allowed an unprecedented Opposition meeting to take place yesterday, but expelled European legislators and reporters to prevent them attending.

 Italy and Spain summoned the Cuban ambassadors in Rome and Madrid to explain the expulsions, which could hurt Havanas ties with the EU that are already complicated by human rights concerns.

 Some 200 dissidents chanted Freedom, Freedom and Down with Fidel Castro at the meeting in a fruit orchard on the outskirts of Havana as they called for democratic change in Cuba. It was the first general meeting of the Assembly to Promote Civil Society, a US-backed umbrella organisation that joins dozens of small dissident groups across Cuba.

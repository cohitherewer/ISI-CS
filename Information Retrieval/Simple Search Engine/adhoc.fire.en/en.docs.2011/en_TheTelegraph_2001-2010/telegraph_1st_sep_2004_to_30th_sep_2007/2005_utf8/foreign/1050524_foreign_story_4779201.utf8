 Saddam pictures shock daughter

 Raghad

 Amman, May 23 (AFP): A daughter of Saddam Hussein was outraged by the published pictures of her jailed father dressed only in underwear, an aide said today. 

 She was shocked and outraged because of the pictures, which appeared in The Sun tabloid, the aide of Raghad Hussein said.

 She described the pictures as inhumane, and wondered why her father is not being treated as a human being and the father of three daughters, the source said. 

 The Sun published on Friday a front-page cover of a bare-chested Saddam standing in his underwear with the headline Tyrants in his pants, using the British term for underwear briefs. 

 Another photograph of the Saddam washing his clothes by hand in a bucket along with shots of other detainees was printed on Saturday.

 Raghad lives in Jordan with her sister Rana and their kids since they were granted asylum in July 2003. Their youngest sister Hala and mother Sajedah live in Qatar.

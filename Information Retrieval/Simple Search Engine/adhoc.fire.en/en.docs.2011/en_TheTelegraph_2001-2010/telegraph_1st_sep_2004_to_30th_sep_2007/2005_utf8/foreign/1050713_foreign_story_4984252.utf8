 Monaco, July 12 (Reuters): Prince Albert of Monaco, son of Prince Rainier and Hollywood actor Grace Kelly, ascended the throne today in ceremonies that delighted the principality after months of mourning and revelations about his love life.

 The 47-year-old princes admission that he had an illegitimate son with a French flight attendant of Togolese origin had threatened to overshadow his enthronement after a three-month mourning period for his father, Prince Rainier.

 But the scandal did not dampen spirits in Monaco where several hundred people attended a Roman Catholic Mass celebrating Alberts enthronement and many others watched on special screens erected outside the cathedral.

 Red and white national flags fluttered on buildings and lampposts across the principality. A fireworks display and an open-air ball were planned later, and Monacos mayor was to give Albert the city keys in a symbolic handover.

 Were very proud of our prince, our little prince, said one middle-aged woman attending the Mass at the cathedral where Rainiers marriage to Princess Grace in 1956 brought glamour to the tiny Mediterranean state.

 French President Jacques Chirac congratulated Albert in a letter which said: Your reign marks the start of new relations between our two countries, marked by trust and the re-establishment of the strong links that bind us.

 Todays ceremonies officially installed Albert in power although he has carried out duties as head of state since his fathers death on April 6. 

 The Grimaldi dynasty that has ruled for more than seven centuries is all too familiar with tragedy and bad publicity ? and Albert is no exception.

 Soon after Rainiers death, Paris Match magazine reported that Albert had fathered a boy called Alexandre and published photos of him with the child, now aged two. The prince, who had previously kept a lower profile than his much photographed sisters, publicly acknowledged the boys existence last week and discussed him in a rare television interview yesterday.

 Asked by Frances TF1 channel whether he might face similar paternity claims in the future, Albert made clear he expected other people to come forward with such stories now that he is in the public eye and added: We will respond when the time comes.

 He said he was shocked the media had published stories about the child before mourning ended for Rainier, but promised to meet his duties towards the child. The boy will not succeed Albert because under Monacos constitution only a child born in wedlock can become monarch.

 Alberts sisters Caroline and Stephanie have often made headlines mainly for their marriage problems.

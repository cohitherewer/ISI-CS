 Neighbours shrug off N. Korea missile test

 Seoul/Tokyo, May 2 (Reuters): North Korea?s suspected missile test at the weekend was not a major worry for the region since it appeared to be a short-range weapon incapable of carrying a nuclear warhead, officials said today.

 But the test would strain efforts to restart talks on Pyongyang?s nuclear programmes, they said.

 North Korea test-launched what appeared to be a short-range missile into the Sea of Japan yesterday, US officials said. 

 The test came as Washington officials indicated Pyongyang may be headed toward a nuclear test.

 ?Is this the kind of missile that can carry a nuclear warhead? Not really,? a South Korean government official said on condition of anonymity, referring to yesterday?s test.

 A defence ministry spokeswoman in Tokyo said Japan had yet to confirm whether the launch took place. 

 ?At this point, the missile in question is thought to have flown a very short distance and cannot be described as something that immediately has a particular impact on our country?s security,? a spokeswoman said. 

 Analysts said Pyongyang may have meant to send a jolt to a six-party process aimed at ending North Korea?s nuclear ambitions, which have been stalled since June 2004.

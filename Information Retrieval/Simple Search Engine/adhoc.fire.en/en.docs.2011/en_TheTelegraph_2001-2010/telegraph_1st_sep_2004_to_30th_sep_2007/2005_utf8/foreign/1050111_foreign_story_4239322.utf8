 Attack kills police officer

 Baghdad, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Gunmen assassinated Baghdad?s deputy police chief outside his home, and a suicide bomber in a patrol car killed three Iraqis at a police station today, a police source said.

 Brigadier Amer Nayef was shot dead along with his son as they left the family home in the Dora area in the south of the capital, the source said.

 The powerful blast at the police station in the southern Zaafaraniya area left several officers injured. Militant group Army of Ansar al-Sunna said one of its fighters blew up his vehicle, which it said ?resembled those used by Iraqi police?.

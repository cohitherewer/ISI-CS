 Fine Print

 Best fat eatery

 London, April 19 (Reuters): In a country which boasts such delicacies as sardines on toast comes the newly crowned finest restaurant in the world ? serving ?sardine on toast sorbet?.

 The Fat Duck, an English countryside former pub, has topped an annual list of the world?s best restaurants, marking a new gastronomic triumph for a country once known for, well, other reasons besides its food.

 British restaurants won four of the top 10 spots and 14 of the top 50, beating countries like France and the US.

 Admittedly, Restaurant magazine, which compiled the list, is published in London but its selections are based on the opinions of more than 500 industry experts around the world.

 The Fat Duck is run by chef Heston Blumenthal who has pioneered ?molecular gastronomy? ? advanced techniques to develop unusual taste combinations like ?smoked bacon and egg ice cream? and ?leather, oak and tobacco chocolates?.

 Rubber dog

 Stockholm (Reuters): A rubber duck sat 

 in a dog?s stomach for five years before being removed by 

 Swedish vets last week, a local newspaper said on Tuesday. 

 The owner of Apollo the Boxer dog assumed the toy had dissolved 

 in his stomach over the years as it had not come out any 

 other way.

 Rescuers battle horror to recover bodies

 London, July 10: It is a grisly task in hellish conditions. Rescue workers braved intense heat and blinding dust to search for bodies trapped 100ft below the ground near Kings Cross Tube station in central London yesterday.

 The rescuers, wearing protective gear and breathing apparatus, used cutting and grinding equipment to force their way through the mangled wreckage of the train blown up during Thursdays rush hour.

 It was gruelling, painstaking work in the claustrophobic 11 foot-wide tunnel. The rescuers had to proceed with great care as they recovered bodies ? and body parts ? from among the wrecked seats, twisted bars and shattered glass, because forensic investigators followed immediately behind them looking for clues about the killers.

 As one investigator said: Every body or body part is evidence for the investigation.

 Officials declined to say how many bodies were recovered yesterday but the work is not finished yet. The search will resume today when police hope that the last remaining bodies will be found.

 The human remains were examined in situ by the forensic teams and then removed to a laboratory where they were re-examined before being taken to a mortuary in London.

 We are doing everything we can to help the investigation but also to preserve the dignity of the victims, a British Transport Police spokesman said.

 Police said that some of the victims had been identified by relatives but no formal identification had taken place and no names would be released until that happened. 

 Some victims were expected to be named late last night or today.

 As well as examining bodies, the forensic team at Russell Square sifted through the debris, searching for other clues that might help to explain who was responsible for the appalling carnage and what they used to cause it.

 The rescuers faced horrendous physical, psychological and logistical difficulties. The grim nature of the work took its toll and some workers were given counselling because they were unable to cope with scenes that confronted them.

 It was like the Towering Inferno down there, one experienced rescuer said. Ive seen some shocking things but nothing as bad as this. There were people with limbs missing and their organs spilling out. We can only pray that they died quickly. 

 The heat was almost unbearable. It was dark and dusty but we are doing everything we can to make sure no clues are lost.

 The rescue effort was also hampered by the presence of rats scurrying over the wreckage and gnawing at the victims decomposing bodies. It was pretty disgusting, said one rescuer. The terrible smell was making us gag.

 Doctors seek smoking ban

 London, May 12 (Reuters): British doctors called today for a ban on smoking in all enclosed public places, saying government proposals for a partial ban could be unworkable.

 The British Medical Association, which represents three quarters of the countrys doctors, said plans to outlaw smoking in workplaces, restaurants and in pubs serving food do not go far enough.

 It wants Prime Minister Tony Blairs re-elected government to follow the example of Ireland, Norway and other countries that have banned smoking. It is time the Labour party showed leadership and ban smoking in all enclosed public places, a BMA representative said.

 Hospital detour for Jackson

 Michael Jackson: Beat it

 Santa Maria (California), Feb. 15 (Reuters): Pop star Michael Jackson was rushed to a hospital emergency room today after falling ill en route to the courtroom where jury selection in his child-molestation trial is taking place, the judge in the case said.

 Santa Barbara county superior court judge Rodney Melville told about 100 prospective jurors in the case: ?You?ll notice Mr Jackson is not in court today.? He added that Jackson had been taken ill while en route to court and was rushed to the emergency room of a nearby hospital instead. A spokeswoman at the Marian Medical Center where Jackson was believed taken declined comment.

 But Jackson?s lawyers said in court that their 46-year-old client was feeling very ill. The nature of his illness was not immediately clear and Melville said that he would hold a conference call with doctors at the hospital and the lawyers in the case later in the morning. In the meantime, the prospective jurors remained in court.

 Jackson is charged in a 10-count indictment with molesting a then-13-year-old boy at his Neverland Valley Ranch and with conspiring to commit child abduction, false imprisonment and extortion.

 Jackson?s lawyers plan to call some of the most famous people in America to testify in his defence, including basketball star Kobe Bryant, actor Elizabeth Taylor and Tonight Show host Jay Leno, the pop star?s lead attorney said.

 Attorney Tom Mesereau rattled off his list of more than 350 defence witnesses, including singers Barry Gibb, Nick Carter, Diana Ross and Stevie Wonder, talkshow host Larry King, author and lifestyle guru Deepak Chopra and comedian Chris Tucker. Mesereau also said he would call 10 members of Jackson?s family to the witness stand.

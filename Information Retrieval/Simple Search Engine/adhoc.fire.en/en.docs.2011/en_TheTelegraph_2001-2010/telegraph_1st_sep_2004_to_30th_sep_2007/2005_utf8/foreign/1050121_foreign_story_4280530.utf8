 Mosquito easy-meat mystery cracked

 NIC FLEMING

 London, Jan. 20: Some people are unattractive to mosquitoes because they exude chemicals that act as a natural repellent, according to a study published today.

 Researchers believe they have solved the age-old mystery of why certain unfortunate individuals are bitten more than others.

 Contrary to previous theories that say some have more of the chemicals that make them a target, the new study suggests different people have varying ability to produce a natural repellent.

 A PhD student and his fellow researchers now hope their discovery will lead to the development of more effective repellents. James Logan, 25, a research student at the Rothamsted agricultural research centre in Hertfordshire, refused to identify the specific chemicals involved because he and his fellow researchers are in the process of patenting their discovery.

 He said: ?We know certain chemicals attract mosquitoes. We believe everyone has these.

 ?But people who are unattractive to mosquitoes have something extra. We have identified chemicals they give off to mask the odours that would otherwise make them a target for mosquitoes.? The new research, published in this month?s issue of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council magazine, was a collaboration between Logan and Prof. Jenny Mordue, professor of zoology at the University of Aberdeen.

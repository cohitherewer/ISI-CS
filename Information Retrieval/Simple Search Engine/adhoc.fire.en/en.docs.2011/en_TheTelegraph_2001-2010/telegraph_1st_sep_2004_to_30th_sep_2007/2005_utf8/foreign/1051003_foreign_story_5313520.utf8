 After Kate, its mate

 Doherty: Double trouble?

 London, Oct. 2 (AFP): Pete Doherty, the drug-addicted rock musician boyfriend of supermodel Kate Moss, is thought to have been arrested by police following a raid on his tour bus, a spokesman said today.

 Police in Shrewsbury, a town in central England, said they had carried out searches at one address and two coaches and detained a number of people in a major operation involving police dogs and forensic teams.

 As is usual practice before formal charges are laid, police declined to name any of the detained people.

 Dohertys band, Babyshambles, played a concert in Shrewsbury last night and a spokesman for the musician said he believed the singer-guitarist could have been among those held.

 He might have been held overnight, although Im trying to find out from someone in his entourage whats going on, the spokesman said.

 Doherty, a 25-year-old self-confessed user of heroin, crack cocaine and other drugs, has been dating Moss for some months.

 The supermodel, 31, has lost a series of big-name clients in recent weeks following newspaper allegations she was a cocaine user. Moss has since checked into a US clinic.

 Britains newspapers have found the relationship between the fashion icon and her infamously scruffy and disorganised beau a source of seemingly endless fascination.

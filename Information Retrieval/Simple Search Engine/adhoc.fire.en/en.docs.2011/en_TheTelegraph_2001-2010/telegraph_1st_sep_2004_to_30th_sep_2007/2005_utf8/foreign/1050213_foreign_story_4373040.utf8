 Commonwealth slap on Musharraf wrist

 AMIT ROY

 London, Feb. 12: Pervez Musharraf yesterday received a slap on the wrist from senior commonwealth ministers for continuing to hold the dual roles of Pakistani President and army chief and not relinquishing the latter post as he had once promised to do.

 However, the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group on the Harare Declaration, which concluded a two-day meeting in London, made no moves towards suspending Pakistan once again from membership of the Commonwealth.

 Nigerian foreign minister Olu Adeniji said after the meeting that the possibility of once again suspending Pakistan had been considered but rejected because there had been no consensus on the matter. In any case, Musharraf has an unlikely ally these days in India.

 The summit was seen by some as being more ?Africa versus Pakistan?, rather the ?Commonwealth versus Pakistan?, with such countries as Nigeria detecting western double standards on the question of democracy. They feel the West is putting the heat on Zimbabwe because it is determined to oust Robert Mugabe from power, while tolerating an undemocratic Musharraf because he is ?America?s ally in the right against terrorism?.

 India?s Natwar Singh did not come to the London summit. Instead, the high commissioner in London Kamalesh Sharma represented India, indicating perhaps that at a time when Indian relations with Pakistan are improving, Delhi is not keen to destabilise Musharraf. This time, India only made the right noises.

 The countries represented in the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, who were meeting for the third time, include Nigeria, the Bahamas, Lesotho, Malta, Tanzania, Sri Lanka, Canada, India and Samoa.

 The group, which has been set up to represent the whole of the commonwealth, ?expressed its serious concern and regret that President Musharraf had not met his commitment to relinquish his role as chief of army staff by 31 December 2004?.

 The ministers ?noted that President Musharraf had been authorised by the Senate and the National Assembly to retain the two offices and has himself undertaken not to continue as chief of army staff beyond 2007. The group nevertheless urged President Musharraf to relinquish one of the two offices.?

 The group said that it expected ?the two offices not to be combined in the same person beyond the end of the current Presidential term in 2007 at the latest?.

 To international observers, it must seem ironic that standards of democracy in Pakistan have now fallen below even that of Africa. The ministers ?affirmed that the holding by the same person of the offices of head of state and chief of army staff is incompatible with the basic principles of democracy?.

 While Musharraf has argued that 

 without him holding both jobs, there would be no democracy 

 in Pakistan, the commonwealth group has taken the opposite 

 view ? there will be no democracy while he clings to both 

 jobs.

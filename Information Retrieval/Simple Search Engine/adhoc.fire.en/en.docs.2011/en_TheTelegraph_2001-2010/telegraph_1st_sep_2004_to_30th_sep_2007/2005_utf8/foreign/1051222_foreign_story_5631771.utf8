 I have been beaten: Saddam

 Baghdad, Dec. 21 (Reuters): Saddam Hussein told his trial today he was beaten in US custody and, in an extraordinary outburst towards the end of the hearing, also said those who had tortured Iraqis should be punished for their crimes.

 The former Iraqi President spent most of the session sitting quietly in the defendants dock as prosecution witnesses told the court of the beatings and abuse they and other former detainees say they suffered in Saddams jails.

 But late in the hearing, the man who ruled Iraq for a quarter of a century rose to his feet and told the judge he had been abused by US forces since his arrest in late 2003.

 I have been hit by the Americans and tortured, he said, speaking purposefully. I have been beaten on every place of my body, and the signs are all over my body.

 Then, in one of the more conciliatory statements he has made during the trial, he said those guilty of the alleged torture described by the witnesses should be punished, apparently distancing himself from the accusations.

 When I hear that any Iraqi has been hurt it hurts me too, the 68-year-old said. The wrongs that were done to those people were wrong and, according to law, those who did it should get what they deserve.

 Speaking in Washington, state department spokesman Sean McCormack described Saddams claim that he was tortured as highly ironic and said he knew of nothing to substantiate it.

 Look, hes been given to grandstanding in this trial, but where the focus should be is on the testimony of those people who were victimised... he said. Thats what people should be listening to.

 The court heard from three witnesses who made some of the most coherent, specific and at times chilling allegations yet against Saddams followers.

 One witness said how guards in Saddams intelligence service heated up plastic tubing and allowed the hot plastic to drip onto the bodies of victims. A second said he was given electric shocks. While he screamed in agony, Saddams half-brother and former intelligence chief Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti ate grapes and watched, the witness said.

 The third witness, who, like the second, spoke from behind a curtain to hide his identity, said Saddams guards attached electrodes to his hands, feet and penis and gave him electric shocks before pulling out his fingernails and toenails.

 Glare on Pak nuke dad network

 Washington, Jan. 30 (PTI): Indicating that the full ramifications of disgraced Pakistani scientist A.Q. Khan?s nuclear proliferation network are yet to be revealed, the chief UN nuclear inspector has said if he is elected for the third term in office he would like to ?get to the bottom? of the issue.

 Khan, father of Pakistan?s nuclear programme, provided ?the complete kit for a nuclear weapon to Libya,? Mohamed Elbaradei said in an interview to the Washington Post. ?I want to get the Iran issue out of the way and get to the bottom of the A.Q. Khan network.?

 He also warned that it is a ?real possibility? that some terror groups such as the al Qaida could have acquired nuclear material.

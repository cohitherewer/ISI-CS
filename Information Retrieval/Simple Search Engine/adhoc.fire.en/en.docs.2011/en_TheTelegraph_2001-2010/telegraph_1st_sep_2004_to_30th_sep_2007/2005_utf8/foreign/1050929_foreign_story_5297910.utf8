 Fine Print

 Lennon Sleeping tale

 London, Sept. 28 (Reuters): John Lennons hand-written lyrics for the Beatles song Im Only Sleeping, scribbled on the back of a final demand bill, are expected to reach up to ?200,000 when they go on sale.

 The first working draft of the lyrics, penned by Lennon in 1966 for the Revolver album, is briefer than the final recorded version and several deletions, alterations and variations were made to the text. It will be auctioned by Christies in London. The 17 lines, mostly written in blue felt pen, have been held in a private collection for over 30 years and are appearing at auction for the first time. A recording of a Beatles concert and a previously unheard interview with Lennon and Yoko Ono are also up for sale. 

 Chatting up a divorce

 Brussels (Reuters): Erotic talk with 

 a virtual partner in chatrooms on the Internet are enough 

 grounds for a spouse to file for divorce, a legal magazine 

 said on Wednesday, citing a recent ruling in Belgium. Belgian 

 legal publication De Juristenkrant said the Brussels Appeals 

 Court ruled that although transcripts of the erotic chatroom 

 conversation do not prove adultery, they do constitute proof 

 of grossly insulting behaviour which is sufficient 

 grounds to file for divorce.

 Fat stamp on Big Macs

 Chicago, Oct. 26 (Reuters): McDonalds Corp. customers will soon know that the Big Mac they bought contains almost half their recommended daily fat intake just by looking at the wrapper.

 In its latest measure to fend off critics that blame the worlds largest restaurant company for contributing to a rising incidence of obesity and other health problems, McDonalds yesterday said it will start printing nutritional information on the packaging of its food.

 Information including calories, fat grams, protein, carbohydrates and sodium is already available in brochures at McDonalds restaurants and on the companys website. But putting it on the wrappers puts it right in front of the customer, McDonalds chief executive Jim Skinner said.

 We think this the absolutely easiest way to communicate it, Skinner said in an interview. 

 He added that the consumer can then choose whether or not to use the information in deciding what to eat.

 Weve given them what they asked for and then people take responsibility about whether they add it up or not add it up, Skinner said.

 The information is similar to the labelling food companies are required to put on packages sold in US stores. It includes the amount of the item ? say, 30 fat grams in a Big Mac ? and the percentage of the daily recommended intake, based on a 2,000 calorie diet (47 per cent of total recommended fat for the Big Mac).

 The companys decision to more clearly show nutritional information comes the same day as a key ruling was released in a closely watched, and long-running lawsuit.

 The plaintiffs in a case against McDonalds were told yesterday that they need to provide more specifics to back up their claims that the chain makes children fat, a US judge ruled.

 The case, which was thrown out of Manhattan federal court two years ago, is back before US district judge Robert Sweet after an appeals court revived it in January.

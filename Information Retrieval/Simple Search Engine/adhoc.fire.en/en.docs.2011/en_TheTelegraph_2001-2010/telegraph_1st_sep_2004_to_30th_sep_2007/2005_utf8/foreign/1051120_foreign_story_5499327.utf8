 India support

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Islamabad, Nov 19: Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz today said Pakistan may use the $25 million India had pledged at Geneva last month to procure Indian construction materials for massive housing requirements in the quake-hit areas.

 Speaking to reporters at the end of the international donors conference, Aziz said his government would consider buying corrugated galvanised iron (CGI) sheets from India to keep prices and the demand in check. Our capacity for producing these sheets is stretched to the maximum because there is great demand, and we shall have to import them, possibly from India, Aziz said.

 Indian minister of state for external affairs E. Ahmad reaffirmed at the conference the Indian pledge made at Geneva on October 26 for reconstruction and rehabilitation of areas ravaged by the October 8 earthquake. Ahmad said India can offer full cooperation in rebuilding health and education infrastructure in areas destroyed by the quake.

 He also suggested the Indian contribution should be used for rebuilding schools and hospitals and that Pakistan could also benefit from the technology available in India for pre-fabricated earthquake-resistant shelters.

 Flood fears in New Orleans

 New Orleans, Sept. 20 (Reuters): New Orleans readied itself for a new evacuation today amid fears that a new hurricane threatening to hit the Gulf of Mexico could wreak fresh havoc in the city devastated by Hurricane Katrina.

 Mayor Ray Nagin, whose ambitious plans to bring residents home had been questioned by President George W. Bush, urged anyone remaining in the city to leave ahead of Hurricane Rita, which he warned could swamp the levees that collapsed and flooded the city three weeks ago.

 Bush, seeking to highlight progress after a much-criticised late start to the hurricane relief effort, planned to visit New Gulfport, Mississippi, and New Orleans today. He was to visit a recovering business in New Orleans. Appearing today on NBCs Today show, Nagin defended his earlier timetable to bring the city back to life ? plans that federal officials had called unrealistic. That schedule is now suspended due to concern about Rita, which was upgraded from tropical storm status to a hurricane this morning.

 I respect what the federal officials are doing down here, but they do not fully comprehend what it is like to lose your home, to lose everything and not know, be sitting out three weeks, Nagin said. 

 So I think it was important that people come back and at least take a look. Eyeing the new storm, state officials said they were recommending a mandatory evacuation for New Orleans and two parishes by tomorrow.

 Nagin said the city would makemore aggressive plans for an evacuation than were in place ahead of Katrina, when thousands were left stranded without any way to leave the stricken city. Current predictions point to a Texas landfall for Rita at weeks end, but he said there was a chance it could hit New Orleans.

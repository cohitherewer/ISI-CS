 Iraq voters ratify US-backed statute

 Baghdad, Oct. 25 (Reuters): Iraqi voters ratified a new US-backed constitution despite bitter opposition in Sunni areas where insurgents are battling to topple the Baghdad government, results showed today.

 Iraqs Electoral Commission, giving final results from the October 15 referendum, said 79 per cent of voters backed the constitution against 21 per cent opposed in a poll split largely along Iraqs sectarian and ethnic lines.

 Several Shia and Kurdish regions voted between 95 and 99 per cent Yes in rebellious, Sunni areas 97 per cent said No. Prominent Sunni leaders rejected the referendum as a fraud, warning it could fuel militant violence and discourage Sunnis from participating in future elections. UN and Iraqi election officials said the vote, which was largely peaceful, was fair.

 The results came as the US military death toll in Iraq rose to 1,999 ? closing on the headline-grabbing 2,000 mark expected to spur new calls for President George W. Bush to outline an exit strategy for the Iraqi conflict.

 Anti-government insurgents, who struck in dramatic fashion yesterday with a triple suicide bomb attack on a Baghdad hotel used by foreign journalists, set off new blasts today in Baghdad and the normally tranquil city of Sulaimaniya, killing at least 15 people in total.Al Qaida in Iraq said today it was behind the Baghdad hotel attack, according to a Web posting.

 The referendums final results showed that only two of Iraqs 18 provinces, the insurgent stronghold of Anbar in the west and Saddam Husseins home region of Salahaddin, had mustered a No vote of at least two-thirds ? one short of the three provinces necessary to veto the measure.

 Commission spokesman Farid Ayar rejected suggestions that the results had been tampered with, pointing to the lengthy audit of balloting before the results were announced..Passage of the constitution is a boost for Washington and the Shia- and Kurdish-led government in Baghdad.

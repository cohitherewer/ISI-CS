 Pak tale of grit, defiance

 PETER FOSTER AND NASIR MALICK

 Mukhtaran Mai: Blood, sweat and tears

 Islamabad, March 12: It is a story of oppression and cruelty in Pakistani village life that appals and inspires in equal measure.

 Mukhtaran Mai, a diminutive teaching assistant, was gangraped on the orders of her village council as a revenge-punishment for a crime allegedly committed by her younger brother.

 The sentence, meted out in a darkened room while more than 150 men whooped and cheered outside, was calculated to dishonour and defile her in the eyes of her community. Naked and bleeding, she walked home through her village?s mud street assisted by her weeping father, who had only a shawl to cover his daughter?s shame. That was almost three years ago, but today Mukhtaran, 33, has become a symbol of strength for oppressed women in Pakistan and beyond. Outside her two-room house in Meerwala, 80 miles east of Multan, seven policeman stand guard around the clock.

 They are a direct result of Mukhtaran?s refusal to pay homage to the feudal system that still governs life in rural Pakistan, and of the anger her defiance has caused. ?I shall continue my struggle for the rights of women till my last breath,? she told an International Women?s Day rally in Multan this week. ?I will not bow before tyranny, exploitation, tradition or customs.?

 Her statement was doubly bold as, two weeks ago, a Pakistani appeal court ordered that her four attackers, sentenced to death in 2002, should be acquitted and released. 

 Her refusal to accept her shame ? it is common for rape victims to commit suicide to avoid bringing ?dishonour? to their families ? has also made her an all-too-rare icon of progress in Pakistan. She has led by example. When the governor of the Punjab gave her 250,000 rupees (?2,150) in compensation she used the money not to escape but instead to start two schools in her village, one for girls and the other for boys.

 ?The government offered to move me to Islamabad or Lahore because of concerns about my security,? she said. ?They were ready to settle me in a bungalow but not give a school to this village. quot; Using donations collected from around the world, Mukhtaran is planning to buy 10 buffalo and 50 sheep to start a farm to finance the schools, paying for teachers? salaries and class materials. 

 She is illiterate and her only previous work was as the equivalent of a Sunday-school teacher, chanting memorised verses of the Quran, but Mukhtaran believes the schools are the key to a brighter future for women like her.

 ?As a child, I never thought about education. I was never sent to school. But when I grew up I wished I had been educated. So what I could not achieve myself, I want the next generation to achieve.? ?The educated people in the village and those in urban areas look at me as a brave woman but the uneducated class considers me as a weak voice that won?t change anything,? she said.

 Islamabad, Aug. 14 (Reuters): Pakistan must unite to reject and defeat terrorism which poses a threat to the countrys independence, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz said today.

 Speaking at a ceremony to mark Pakistans Independence Day, Aziz also said a solution of Pakistan;s long-running dispute with India over the Kashmir region was vital for peace in South Asia.

 We have to send a message to the world that our society rejects extremism and is united against it, Aziz said.

 But underlining the problems Pakistan faces 58 years after its independence from Britain, autonomy-seeking militants were believed responsible for a string of small attacks in Baluchistan province, including a rocket attack on a ministers home.

 No one was hurt in the attacks in the gas-rich province.

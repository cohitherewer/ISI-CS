 Chandrika brother new foreign minister

 Anura Bandaranaike

 Colombo, Aug. 22 (Reuters): The brother of Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga was sworn in as foreign minister today to replace Lakshman Kadirgamar, assassinated by suspected Tamil Tiger rebels, the government said.

 Anura Bandaranaike will also retain his portfolio as tourist minister, Kumaratungas office said in a statement. Finance minister Sarath Amunugama has taken over Bandaranaikes Industry and investment promotion portfolio.

 Minister Anura Bandaranaike took his oaths as the minister of foreign affairs before President Chandrika Kumaratunga this evening, the statement said.

 The Bandaranaike family has been one of the dominant forces in national politics since the 1950s, when her father founded the Sri Lanka Freedom Party. Both her parents served as Prime Minister.

 Kadirgamar, an ethnic Tamil who campaigned to have the LTTE outlawed by the US and Britain, was shot dead on August 12 in a killing that raised the spectre of a return to a two-decade civil war that killed more than 64,000 people.

 Kumaratunga has squarely laid blame for the assassination on the Tigers, who have denied any responsibility ? a denial analysts say is a stock disclaimer from the rebels.

 Peace mediator Norway is arranging emergency talks between the age-old foes in a bid to find ways to preserve the three-and-a-half-year truce ? the longest period of relative peace since the Tigers began their war for self-rule in earnest in 1983.

 Sri Lankas Supreme Court will announce on Friday whether the next presidential election will take place this year or next, the chief justice said today, after a bitter political feud drove the issue into the courts.

 Kumaratunga is locked in a public wrangle with her political opponents over the timing of the next presidential election. She cannot run again, and argues that the constitution allows her to serve two full six-year terms despite the fact that she stood for re-election a year early.

 She says she is entitled to stay in power until late 2006.

 Milk good for heart

 NIC FLEMING

 London, May 24: A diet rich in milk may protect people from heart disease and strokes, says a study published today.

 Researchers who studied the diets and health of men over a 20-year period found that those who drank a lot of milk were 12 per cent less likely to have a heart attack and almost half as likely to suffer a stroke.

 The authors of the study ? published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health ? suggest that the widespread perception that milk increases the risk of heart disease is inaccurate.

 Prof. Peter Elwood, from the University of Wales, says: Many cross-sectional studies have shown that milk intake is positively related to blood cholesterol levels and an increase in milk consumption is followed by an increase in cholesterol level. This paper challenges the belief that because milk drinking raises blood cholesterol level it increases the risk of vascular disease.

 The present perception of milk as harmful, in increasing cardiovascular risk, should be challenged, and every effort should be made to restore it to its rightful place in a healthy diet.

 In the group of 665 men aged between 45 and 59 cholesterol levels and blood pressure readings were similar in those who consumed a pint or more of milk a day and those who had less than half a pint. 

 The risk of a stroke among those in the high milk intake group was 88 per cent of that of the whole group.

 New tapes unveil pain, chaos of 9/11 attacks

 New York, Aug. 13 (Reuters): Im trapped. I cant breathe much longer. Save me. I dont have much air. Please help me. I can barely breathe.

 Those panicked words of a civilian on a New York Fire Department radio dispatch tape from the September 11, 2001, attacks were part of dramatic unreleased details of the attacks on New York made public yesterday. The release followed a court order that overruled city efforts to keep some records of the World Trade Center attack private.

 The audio tapes, transcripts of emergency workers radio dispatches and oral histories provided by rescuers after the attacks recount the harrowing and grim moments when thousands of people were trapped and died in the flames and debris of the twin towers.

 Firefighter Maureen McArdle-Schulman described a constant stream of bodies falling from the towers.

 I felt like I was intruding on a sacrament, she said. They were choosing to die, and I was watching them and shouldnt have been, so me and another guy turned away and looked at the wall and we could still hear them hit.

 Rescue worker Lonnie Penn said he found body parts, including a little girls foot. It was like a pink sneaker, he said.

 The citys fire department released roughly 15 hours of radio transmissions and oral histories from more than 500 firefighters and paramedics after the attacks, which killed almost 3,000 people in the towers, including 343 firefighters.

 Some family members have voiced hope that the transcripts and tapes would help determine whether doomed firefighters failed to hear orders to evacuate or chose to keep trying to save people in the rubble despite the deadly consequences.

 The city fought the release, arguing that some oral histories were made with promises of confidentiality and some details would upset the families of those who died.

 After legal action by The New York Times newspaper and several victims families, a state Court of Appeals earlier this year ordered the release of much of the information.

 Some tapes detail efforts by frustrated emergency units to reach one another. Controversy has arisen over failures of the police and fire departments to communicate with one another and possible problems with rescuers radios.

 On a dispatch nearly three hours after the first hijacked jet struck, a voice says: Im getting four different chiefs giving me four different command posts..

 Right now were all alone, says a voice on another tape. The second building came down. I cant see so we have no contact with anybody at this time.

 Iraq kidnap claim

 Dubai, Feb. 6 (Reuters): An Islamist militant group in Iraq claimed responsibility for kidnapping an Italian journalist and threatened to kill her by tomorrow, following an earlier kidnap claim, according to an Internet statement.

 The statement, which could not be verified, was signed by the Jihad Organisation and threatened to kill Giuliana Sgrena if Italy did not withdraw its troops from Iraq.

 A group with a similar name, the Islamic Jihad Organisation, claimed on Friday to have taken Sgrena and set a 72-hour deadline for Italy to remove its troops, but did not specifically threaten to kill her.

 It was not clear if the latest posting was by a separate group.

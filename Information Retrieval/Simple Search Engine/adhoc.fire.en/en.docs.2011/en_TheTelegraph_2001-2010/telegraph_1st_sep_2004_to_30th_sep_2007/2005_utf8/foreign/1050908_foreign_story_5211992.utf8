 Mubarak favourite as Egypt votes

 Cairo, Sept. 7 (Reuters): Egyptians voted today in the countrys first contested presidential elections, with President Hosni Mubarak expected to win a fifth six-year term as the leader of the Arab worlds most populous nation.

 Polling stations opened across the country of 72 million at or soon after 0500 GMT and trickles of people chose between Mubarak and his nine rivals, most of them little-known leaders of political parties with few members.

 Mubarak, 77, has won office four times since 1981 through referendums in which he was the single candidate, chosen by a parliament dominated by the ruling National Democratic Party.

 He changed the system this year, after the US and Egyptian protest groups pressed for reform, but opposition politicians say they doubt he wants real political change. Observers said they had seen some abuses or irregularities.

 Mohamed Fayoumi, a volunteer with the monitoring group Shayfeencom, said the head of one polling station was making voters mark their ballot papers in open and that government cars are taking voters to vote. 

 Gameela Ismail, spokeswoman for liberal opposition party candidate Ayman Nour, said the indelible ink meant to prevent double voting comes off easily if rubbed with deodorant.

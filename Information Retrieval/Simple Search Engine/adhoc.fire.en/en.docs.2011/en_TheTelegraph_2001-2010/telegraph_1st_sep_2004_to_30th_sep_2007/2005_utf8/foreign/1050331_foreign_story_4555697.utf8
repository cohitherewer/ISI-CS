 Forbidden fruit fine on Swank

 Wellington, March 30 (AP): Two-time Oscar-winning actor Hilary Swank has been fined for bringing forbidden fruit into New Zealand, after getting a thumbs down in an appeal, a court said today.

 Swank was asked to pay a fine for breaching New Zealand?s strict quarantine laws when she failed to declare an apple and an orange while arriving on January 15 from Los Angeles, but appealed to a court. The Manukau district court today advised the country?s ministry of agriculture and forestry that her appeal had been rejected and she had been fined $142 plus costs of $21.

 Swank, winner of the best actress Oscar for her role as a boxer in Clint Eastwood?s Million Dollar Baby, had written to the ministry seeking a court hearing to have her fine expunged. ?After my 20-hour flight I simply forgot I had one orange and one apple. I do apologise sincerely,? she said in her handwritten letter.

 US legal blow to India tech ties

 K.P. NAYAR 

 Washington, Nov. 22: Twelve days before a key meeting of the Indo-US group on high-technology cooperation, a court in Boston has dealt a public relations setback to joint efforts by Washington and New Delhi to ease the flow of American goods and technology which can be put to both civilian and military use in India.

 In a case that dates back 17 years, Walter Lachman, now 72, and Maurice Subilia Jr, now 58, were accused of illegally exporting a control panel to the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO) which helped to improve the accuracy of Indias nuclear-capable ballistic missile, Agni.

 The export required a special license from the US government because the Americans were concerned that Agni could carry nuclear warheads and India was not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), according to federal prosecutors.

 Lachman and Subilia have been sentenced to one year of home detention and three years probation. In addition, Subilia has been sentenced to six months term in a halfway house for perjury in the case. 

 Both men and their company in Maine, Fiber Materials Inc, were also fined $250,000.

 The control panel was for the operation of a hot isostatic press to be used in the processing of a material called carbon-carbon, a light-weight, heat-absorbing substance, which is used for thermal protection systems and has applications in missile nosetips, rocket nozzles and re-entry heatshields, according to details of the case in a legal journal.

 The hot isostatic press was also supplied to a DRDO laboratory by the two men, but the case does not cover this supply since it was procured from Europe and, therefore, does not come under the ambit of American export control laws.

 Federal prosecutors told the court that in 1991 and 1992, Fiber Materials Inc sent its employees to India to install and operate the carbon-carbon processing equipment and connect the control panel to the production-size hot isostatic press in violation of US laws.

 DRDO publicly claimed after these exports that it had successfully established re-entry technology with carbon-carbon heat shield for its Agni missiles.

 Lachman and Subilia were found guilty and sentenced on March 31, 1995, but they filed motions to dismiss the conviction. After eight years, in 2003, a District Judge dismissed the convictions on grounds that the federal export rules were unconstitutionally vague although he called the actions by the two men fundamentally reprehensible.

 The government appealed, and last year, an appeals court reinstated the convictions. The sentences were based on that appeal verdict and the district judge considered the delay in the case as a factor mitigating the sentences.

 David McCormick, the new head of the US Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and under-secretary of commerce, will soon leave for India with a high-level team for a key meeting on high-technology cooperation.

 Cafe culture under scanner

 London, Nov. 19: University researchers who spent three years investigating the rise of the cappuccino culture in Britain, have concluded that high street caf?s are convivial places where people go to enjoy others company. 

 They should know. They have just spent ?140,000 of taxpayers money finding out. 

 Eric Laurier and Chris Philo, two human geography researchers at Glasgow University, spent more than a year visiting a range of caf?s, from branches of Starbucks and Caff? Nero to out-of-town greasy-spoon establishments. 

 They spent a day making fly-on-the-wall videotapes of customers and staff in five caf?s in London, Manchester, Edinburgh and Glasgow. As part of the research, Dr Laurier worked in Caff? Nero for two days. Their tireless efforts to increase human understanding also involved one of the researchers becoming regulars in four caf?s, where they gathered data on the full set of caf? experiences, from breakfast out to treats such as cake and hazelnut frappuccinos. 

 A field trip to Italy was, however, vetoed by the projects funder, the Economic and Social Research Council . 

 Dr Laurier, now at Edinburgh University, said that he undertook the research because he was interested in observing how, in a fragmented society, people were finding new ways of coming together again. 

 We were studying the everyday life that we all know. The things we are reporting on are things we know already. There is nothing there that would make you say: Oh gosh,, he concedes. 

 Indeed. Among the reports conclusions are that caf?s are often nicer places than pubs for women with small children to go to and that people will stop going if the coffee is no good. 

 The report also found that when people ask to borrow a newspaper from another client, that can lead either to a cold shoulder or a warm response.

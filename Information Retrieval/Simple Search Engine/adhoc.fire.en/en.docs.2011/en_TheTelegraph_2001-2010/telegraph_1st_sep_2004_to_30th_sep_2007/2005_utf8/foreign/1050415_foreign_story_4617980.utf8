 London, April 14: Italian and French scientists today announced that they had created the world?s second cloned horse.

 According to the BBC, the foal is a copy of a world endurance champion horse called Pieraz, who had been castrated and was, therefore, incapable of normal reproduction. The research was undertaken by genetic engineering labs Cryozootech of Evry, France, and LTR-CIZ of Cremona, Italy, where the foal is being kept, BBC said in a report on its website.

 The world?s first horse clone Prometea, was produced by the same group of researchers in 2003. The new clone, called Pieraz-Cryozootech-Stallion, was born on February 25, 2005. 

 Pieraz, the donor of the genetic material used to create the foal, reached the top of his equestrian discipline in 1994 and 1996. Endurance riding involves racing at controlled speeds over distances of many tens of kilometres.

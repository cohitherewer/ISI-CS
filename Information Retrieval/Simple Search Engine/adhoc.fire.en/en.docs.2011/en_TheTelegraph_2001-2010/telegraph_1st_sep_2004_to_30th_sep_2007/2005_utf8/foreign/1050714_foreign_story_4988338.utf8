 Pak foiled raid before polls

 Islamabad, July 13 (Reuters): Pakistan helped thwart a militant attack in Britain before a general election there in May, Pakistani interior minister Aftab Ahmed Khan Sherpao said today.

 Arrests were made in several countries after Pakistan gave information to Britain about a possible attack, Sherpao said in Islamabad. Let me be specific, that before the general elections in the UK we had received reports that this sort of situation may arise before the elections, he said. Sherpao said Pakistan would give Britain its full cooperation in the investigation into last Thursdays bombings in London.

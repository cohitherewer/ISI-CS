 Islamabad, May 5: Angelina Jolie was in Peshawar today, visiting Afghan refugees. 

 The star of Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, who has been dogged by rumours of a relationship with Brad Pitt, is a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

 Travelling from the capital Islamabad, Jolie went straight to Kacha Ghari refugee camp on the outskirts of the northern city of Peshawar where she was received by hundreds of Afghans, many of whom did not know her as a Hollywood star.

 She went around the camp and spoke to the people to see how they were doing and to assess the arrangements for their voluntary repatriation to their homeland. Jolie also met the governor of North-West Frontier Province (NWFP).

 On a four-day visit to Pakistan, the Oscar-winning star who was recently voted 2005s most beautiful woman by People magazine, Jolie met Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz in Islamabad yesterday and thanked him for his countrys support to the Afghan refugees.

 ?Pakistan is hosting the Afghan refugees for many many years and UNHCR greatly appreciates this,? she told reporters after the meeting at Prime Minister House. She also praised Aziz as a ?wonderful? person for doing so much for the refugees.

 Since making her debut in 1984, Jolie has starred in many box-office hits but is best known in Pakistan for her role in Tomb Raider, incidentally a film that was shot partly in Cambodia from where she adopted her three-year-old son Maddox in 2002 after meeting him in an orphanage.

 Since becoming the UNHCR goodwill ambassador in August 2001, Jolie has visited several refugee camps around the world. She last visited camps in Pakistan in 2002.

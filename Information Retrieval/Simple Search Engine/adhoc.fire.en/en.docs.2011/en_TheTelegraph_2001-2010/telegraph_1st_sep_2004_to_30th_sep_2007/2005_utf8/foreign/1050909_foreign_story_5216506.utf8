 Redford, JLo in film that seems like Baby

 New York, Sept. 8 (Reuters): Robert Redfords new film teams him with last years Oscar winner Morgan Freeman as two grumpy old men whose lives are jolted by the arrival of a bruised and angry young woman.

 Sound familiar?

 The relationships between the three main characters draws obvious comparisons to Clint Eastwoods Oscar-winning Million Dollar Baby, but An Unfinished Life is a very different film, and not just because the daughter figure is played by Jennifer Lopez rather than Hilary Swank.

 Set in wild Wyoming and directed by Lasse Hallstrom, whose credits include Chocolat and The Cider House Rules, it is a slow meditation on grudges and forgiveness, with a grizzly bear and an 11-year-old girl thrown in to stir things up.

 Redford says he even broke one of his longstanding rules ? never to act with a bear ? so that he could play in the film.

 Redfords character Einar has been brooding over the death of his son for more than a decade, alone on his ranch but for his hired hand and old friend Mitch, played by Freeman.

 Einars daughter-in-law Jean, who was driving the car in the accident that killed her husband, returns to the ranch with her daughter, whose existence is a surprise to Einar, after she is beaten one too many times by her current boyfriend.

 The film is very, very different from the normal kind of films that are coming out right now, Redford said, adding that falling US box-office numbers might be linked to public dissatisfaction with fast-paced, action blockbusters.

 Theyre so full of high-tech and slam-bam technical stuff that the public is getting tired of it and they might be looking for something else and this film might fit that, he said in an interview.

 This is different in the sense that it allows an audience to reflect as it moves. It does have the kind of flow of a river flowing, Redford said.

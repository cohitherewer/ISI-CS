 Second US mad cow disease case

 Washington, June 25 (Reuters): The US reached out today to its major trading partners, including Japan and South Korea, to assure them that US beef was safe despite the discovery of a second US case of mad cow disease.

 The US agriculture department today confirmed the new case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), the first in an adult beef cow apparently born in the US.

 Agriculture secretary Mike Johanns sought to calm consumer concerns about the US beef supply, saying the infected animal did not enter the human food or animal feed supplies. Let me just reassure people there is nothing to worry about relative to BSE in beef, Johanns said in an interview on the CBS Early Show television programme. Our safeguards worked to keep the animal away from the food supply.

 Despite Johanns efforts, Taiwan re-instated its ban on American beef imports.

 We anticipated this from them, USDA spokesman Ed Loyd said. We are going to work with them to expeditiously reopen the market to US beef.

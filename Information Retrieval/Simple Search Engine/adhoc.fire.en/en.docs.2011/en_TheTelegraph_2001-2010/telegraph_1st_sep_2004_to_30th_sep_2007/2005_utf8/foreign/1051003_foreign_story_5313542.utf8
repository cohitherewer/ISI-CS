 Kiss amp; tell on Tony? Not first girlfriend

 ANDREW ALDERSON

 Cherie Blair

 London, Oct. 2: When Cherie Blair outed the first boy with whom she shared a childhood kiss, Stephen Smerdon, now a pub landlord, was happy to recall the tender moment. It was my first kiss. It was her first kiss. We didnt have a clue what we were doing, he said last week.

 Yet, when the first girl the Prime Minister himself is believed to have kissed nearly four decades ago was tracked down this weekend, she was more reluctant to describe their shared experience.

 Amanda Hay, a judges daughter, an independent film producer and a married mother of two, laughed off her school romance with Tony Blair, but in no way denied that she had been close to the Prime Minister. How would I know if I was the first girl to kiss him? she giggled. Amanda, 51, lives on the outskirts of Oxford with her husband, Michael Hay, an academic who is deputy dean of the London Business School, and their two children.

 However, she still remembers the Prime Minister as warmly and affectionately as Smerdon remembers Cherie Blair. I was his girlfriend. He was so bright, so engaging and very funny, she has said.

 He could always get away with teasing the masters and, looking back, I suppose it was because he was cleverer than most of them. He was not really into politics at the time ? it was more Led Zeppelin and Cream ? but I was never surprised that he joined Labour. That was always there.

 Amanda would not be drawn on whether she was still in contact with Blair. No! No! No! No! No! I have absolutely nothing to say on this subject, she said with a laugh.

 As a schoolgirl, the-then Amanda Mackenzie-Stuart had the distinction of being the first girl admitted to Fettes College in Edinburgh. Her father, Lord Mackenzie-Stuart, was a judge and a school governor and when Fettes decided to admit girls, he thought his daughter should join the bastion of privilege for the sons of the well-to-do. She started in September 1970, aged 16.

 Master Blair and Miss Mackenzie-Stuart went out together for several months. But later the young Blair had a rival for his girlfriends affection in Charles Falconer, son of an Edinburgh solicitor and now the Lord Chancellor. Lord Falconer, who has been described as the Prime Ministers closest and dearest friend, also shared a love of rock music.

 Lady Mackenzie-Stuart, Amandas mother, has said of her daughter, Blair and Lord Falconer: They were close friends, the three of them. Amanda was fond of both of them and shes delighted they have done so well for themselves.

 Cherie Blair revealed the details of her first kiss at the Labour Party conference in Brighton last week. It took place near Victoria Park in Liverpool, under a railway bridge when she and her first boyfriend were both aged 11. The Prime Minister and Amanda are, however, less keen to reveal the location of their first kiss ? possibly behind the bike shed at Fettes College?

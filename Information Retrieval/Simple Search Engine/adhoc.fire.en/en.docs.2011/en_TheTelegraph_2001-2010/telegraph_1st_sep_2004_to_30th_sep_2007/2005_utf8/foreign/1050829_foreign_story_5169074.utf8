 Fine Print

 Bull run

 Madrid, Aug. 28 (Reuters): A herd of 

 charging bulls injured 63 people, two of them severely, 

 when the animals dashed into a crowd at a Madrid bull-running 

 festival today, emergency officials said.

 The crowd of about 7,000 had run ahead of the bulls all the way to a stadium where the chase was to end, but then a bottleneck developed at the entrance and the bulls caught up with them, local media said. Emergency services said 63 people were treated for injuries. 

 The bull run in Madrids San Sebastian de los Reyes district is known as little Pamplona, as it resembles the July San Fermin bull-running festival there.

 Intruder 

 Los Angeles (Reuters): A man who strolled 

 into actor Jennifer Anistons home in Malibu, telling 

 an employee there he was looking for Jennifer, 

 has been arrested for trespassing, police said. The intruder, 

 identified by police as 48-year-old David Hesterbey of Santa 

 Barbara, California, walked into Anistons beachfront 

 home through an unlocked door while the actor was away. 

 When he saw an employee he said he was looking for 

 Jennifer, but ran away when he was confronted by another 

 employee.

 Big bother

 Amsterdam (Reuters): Dutch authorities 

 are investigating plans by the producers of the Big Brother 

 reality television show to include a pregnant contestant 

 who will give birth on the show. But the 27-year-old pregnant 

 contestant identified only as Tanja defended the idea. I 

 think that my child will be proud of it later, she 

 told De Telegraaf.

 Paternity leave for UK fathers

 London, Oct. 9 (PTI): New fathers in the UK will get six months unpaid paternity leave during the first year of their babys life, according to a legislation planned by the British government.

 The plan will give British fathers some of the most generous paternity rights in the world, The Sunday Times reported. The legislation is expected to be fiercely opposed by business groups, who say it will be disruptive and expensive, especially for small firms.

 According to the report, up to 400,000 men a year will qualify for the leave, which is expected to be introduced in April 2007. At present, new fathers are only legally allowed two weeks leave.

 During that time, they are entitled to ?106 a week in paternity pay from the government, although about half of companies continue with full pay for the fortnight.

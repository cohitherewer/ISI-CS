 Orphans move Sting to song

 Colombo, Feb. 23 (Reuters): Sting has been deeply moved by the suffering of Sri Lankan children who lost parents to Asia?s tsunami and may pen a song about the island?s worst natural disaster, his wife said today.

 Sting and his actor wife Trudie Styler, an ambassador for Unicef, are visiting devastated towns and villages along Sri Lanka?s tsunami-battered southern coast. ?Sting has been very moved and saddened by the plight of the people in Sri Lanka,? Styler said.

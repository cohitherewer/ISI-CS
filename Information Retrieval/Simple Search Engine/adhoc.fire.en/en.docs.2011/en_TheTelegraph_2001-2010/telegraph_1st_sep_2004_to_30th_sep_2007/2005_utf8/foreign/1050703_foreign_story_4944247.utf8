 United Nations, July 2 (Reuters): Iraqs UN ambassador has accused US Marines of shooting to death in cold blood his unarmed 21-year-old cousins son in western Iraq and demanded an immediate investigation.

 Ambassador Samir Sumaidaie said Marines killed Mohammed al-Sumaidaie, an engineering student, during a June 25 raid of his home in Al-Shaikh Hadid, near a US military base at Haditha Dam. All indications point to a killing of an unarmed innocent civilian ? a cold-blooded murder, said Sumaidaie, a Sunni and ally of the US, yesterday. The Marines were smiling at each other as they were leaving.

 Sumaidaie, in a three-page statement, called for an investigation of the killing, saying outrage over the incident could jeopardise public support for the US in Iraq.

 The US military, in its own statement from Camp Fallujah in Iraq, said the ambassadors charges roughly correspond to an incident involving coalition forces on that day in that general location.

 On Tuesday, 100 Iraqi and 1,000 US troops launched a fresh offensive against insurgents in the Sunni Arab western province of Al-Anbar.

 Sumaidaie said insurgents who were not from the area fired mortar rounds at the US base. Then Americans come and rough up the youths in the village demanding information which they simply do not have, he said.

 His accusation was first reported in the London Times.

 Mohammed al-Sumaidaie was at his fathers house with his mother and other relatives on June 25 when Marines knocked at the door at about 10 am local time, the ambassador said, quoting the young mans mother.

 Accompanied by an interpreter, the Marines asked al-Sumaidaie if there were weapons in the house. Family members last saw him alive when he went to another room to get a rifle that had only blanks in it, the ambassador said.

 The younger brother of the dead engineering student was dragged by his hair into a corridor and beaten while the rest of the family was told to wait outside, he said. When the Marines left the house about an hour later, the interpreter told the mother that her son had been shot and killed, according to Sumaidaie.

 He said the family found him dead with a bullet to the neck. 

 The mother led off a deafening cry of anguish but the Marines were smiling at each other as they were leaving, Sumaidaie said. In the bedroom, Mohammed was found dead and laying in a clotted pool of his blood.

 Lankas tsunami pact with Tigers

 Colombo, June 24 (Reuters): Sri Lankas government signed a long-awaited pact to share $3 billion in tsunami aid with the Tamil Tiger rebels today, a senior government official said, a move that could revive a stalled peace process.

 The signing comes after months of political bickering that threatened to collapse the government. Outside parliament, hardline Marxists opposed to the Tigers skirmished with anti-riot police as Buddhist monks in saffron robes noisily helped derail a debate inside.

 The pact, under which committees comprising rebels, government officials and Muslims can recommend, prioritise and monitor projects, has been held up for months because of in-fighting that has split the ruling coalition.

 But the rebels say the pact could help restart talks aimed at converting a three-year ceasefire into permanent peace if properly implemented, a move that would likely boost investor confidence choked by two decades of war. Talks broke down in 2003.

 The government signed the memorandum of understanding, Maithripala Sirisena, leader of the house in parliament, said in his office minutes after protests forced him to abandon a parliamentary debate.

 The aid deal will help speed up relief to tens of thousands of Sri Lankans still living in tents, wooden shacks and rudimentary concrete homes six months after Decembers tsunami killed 40,000 people along the islands shores.

 Leader of the house Sirisena said M.S. Jayasinghe, secretary of the ministry of rehabilitation, had signed the pact on behalf of the government. Senior government aides said a second-tier official was chosen to play down the political importance of the divisive signing.

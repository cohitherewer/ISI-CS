 Lover jailed

 Singapore, Oct. 30 (Reuters): A Singaporean man was sent to jail after he threatened to post nude photos of his former girlfriend on the Internet. 

 The 27-year-old was sentenced to one month in prison for intimidating his 18-year-old girlfriend after she ended their relationship, the Straits Times newspaper reported. He sent the woman numerous threats using phone text messages, the paper said.

 Tigers anthem

 Jaffna (Reuters): Sri Lankas Tamil Tigers ? who already have a national flower and flag for their self-proclaimed state in the parts of the island ? are now on a quest for a catchy national anthem. Those who engage themselves in writing the Tamil National Anthem should give life and energy with great importance to express the greatness, the glory and the resources of the Tamil homeland, the Tigers said in an appeal. It should contain 18 lines ? catchy and lively and in pure Tamil.

 Boar-hunting cops

 Seoul (Reuters): This wild piggy went to an upmarket hotel. This wild piggy went to a historic palace. And all the wild piggies were chased by South Korean police. Police in the capital have been battling an invasion of wild boars that have come down from the mountains into densely populated areas in and around Seoul foraging for food before the onset of winter. On Friday, one turned up at an apartment complex in east of Seoul but the police failed to catch it after a 90-minute chase. Earlier this week, about 200 tourists were evacuated from Changkyong Palace in central Seoul after a wild boar scare.

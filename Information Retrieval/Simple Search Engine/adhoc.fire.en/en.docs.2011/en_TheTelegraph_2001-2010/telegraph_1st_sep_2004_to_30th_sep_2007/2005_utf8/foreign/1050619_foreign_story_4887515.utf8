 DiCaprio hit on head at LA party

 DiCaprio: Bottle brawl

 Los Angeles, June 18 (AP): 

 Leonardo DiCaprio was hit with a bottle while attending 

 a Hollywood party given by Paris Hiltons ex-boyfriend 

 and needed about a dozen stitches to close a wound near 

 his ear, a report said today.

 DiCaprio was at a party at about 4 am yesterday at the home of Rick Salomon when a woman struck him with what appeared to be a beer bottle. No ambulance was called but friends took the actor to a hospital where he received about a dozen stitches, People magazine reported on its website.

 Los Angeles police officer Jason Lee could not immediately confirm the report. I have received no notification of that sort. That doesnt mean that nothing happened, but normally we would get those kind of notifications here, Lee said.

 Denim gets white hot

 JOSEPH V. AMODIO

 Joss Stone: Colour of blues

 New York, June 20: Its a rock star thing. Just about any red-blooded young man has a centre-stage, live-in-concert fantasy. 

 Whatever beat rocks your world ? pop, rhythm and blues, heavy metal ? doesnt matter. Its what Gap executives were no doubt counting on when they decided to feature crooner Joss Stone in their latest ad campaign. 

 Clad in tight white denim, Stone looks as though shes taking part in an impromptu, just-jumped-up-in-front-of-the-microphone session at some after-hours spot. 

 More people would ? even the stage-frightened among us ? harbour a secret desire to jump up there beside her. The opportunity to actually do so doesnt come along all that often. 

 The white denim, however ? hey, that can be done. 

 Theres definitely a rock-star edge to white denim, says Gaps Erica Archambault. Pair it with a sleek metallic top for a hip but elegant night-time look, or dress it down for day wearing capris or cutoffs.

 Denim is ? if youll permit us ? white hot this summer. Thats right, just because black is slimming doesnt (necessarily) mean the opposite dictum is true. 

 Granted, white draws the eye to a specific area, admits Lee Jeans trend analyst Patricia McCune. So use it to focus attention on your positives, she suggests. 

 Designers assist by serving up more than jeans. Capris, shorts, skirts and a variety of jackets can be your ticket to the trend. Lets make one thing perfectly clear. Were not talking cream. Not ivory. Not sand, eggshell, bone, moonbeam or any other excuse for not-quite white. This is white of the full-fledged, icy hot, supernova, retina-searing variety. 

 The kind that used to be saddled with all those lame rules about when ? and only when ? you could wear it. 

 Talk about arbitrary ? pink, purple, yellow or green arent burdened with such restrictions. Those days are gone, says Archambault.

 US military arrives with help in Aceh

 Banda Aceh, Jan. 1 (Reuters): Substantial help finally began reaching refugees in Indonesia?s devastated Aceh province today, and the US military arrived in force to speed the flow of critically needed aid.

 Supplies had started pouring into the airport at the provincial capital, Banda Aceh, yesterday, but much had failed to get out to the nearly 110,000 made homeless by Sunday?s massive earthquake and the powerful tsunami it triggered.

 In the heart of Banda Aceh today, bulldozers cleared a path through the destruction left by the tsunami and bodies could be seen sticking out of piles of debris nearly four metres high that eerily line the streets.

 Elsewhere birds picked at hundreds of bloated, decaying corpses clogging a canal cutting through the provincial capital and filling the air with a nauseating stench. 

 Hundreds of survivors gathered at Banda Aceh?s airport today, captivated by the hive of activity created by five US Sea Hawk helicopters, Singaporean military Super Puma choppers and Australian and Indonesian Hercules transports.

 ?We just got here, we?re here to help and we?re going to keep working until the mission is done ... Where they say they need (aid) we will move it,? Captain Larry Burt, commander of US Carrier Air Wing Two, said.

 The disaster is now known to have killed more than 80.000 people on northern Sumatra island, all but a handful of them in Aceh. Officials say the final toll may exceed 100,000.

 But while aid was finally getting through to some of the needy after days of delay ? a refugee camp at a mosque in Banda Aceh had ample supplies of food early today ? many were still searching for help.

 Faced with the possible spread of disease from polluted water supplies and the hundreds of bodies lying untouched, some survivors ? many in face masks ? began to flee Banda Aceh.

 Genes key to midnight snacks

 Washington, April 21 (Reuters): Is midnight snacking keeping you up late at night and keeping you off your diet? A faulty gene may be to blame, researchers said today.

 They found that mice with a mutation in a gene called ?Clock? controlling circadian rhythms ? a member of a class of genes called clock genes ? develop symptoms similar to those seen in many overweight people, such as diabetes, high cholesterol and a tendency to gain weight.

 Their findings, published in the journal Science, suggests that a brain system that controls the cycles of sleep and waking may also help regulate appetite and metabolism.

 Dr Fred Turek and colleagues at Northwestern University in Illinois and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute found mice with a mutant version of the Clock gene tended to become overweight.

 Their mutant mice were more active during times when rodents usually sleep. 

 They had unusual levels of leptin and ghrelin, both hormones involved in appetite.

 When fed a normal diet, they gained about as much weight as normal mice fed a high-fat diet. When they got fat-laden food, the mice gained even more weight and showed metabolic irregularities.

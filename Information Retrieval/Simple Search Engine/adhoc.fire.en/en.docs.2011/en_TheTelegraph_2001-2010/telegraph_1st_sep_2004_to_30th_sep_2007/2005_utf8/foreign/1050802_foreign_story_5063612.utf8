 A 300-kg rascal and a belly job in space

 Houston, Aug. 1 (Reuters): 

 Two spacewalking astronauts replaced a broken steering device 

 on the International Space Station today and prepared for 

 a possible new and untested venture to space shuttle Discoverys 

 belly to fix the ships heat shield.

 During the second of three spacewalks planned during their mission, astronauts Soichi Noguchi and Steve Robinson removed one of the stations four gyroscopes and replaced it with a new one.

 The gyroscopes keep the outpost properly positioned in space without using the stations limited supply of propellant for rocket thruster burns. 

 After unbolting the old gyroscope, Robinson pulled it out and waited for Noguchi, riding on the stations robot arm, to get into position to carry it away.

 Its not easy for me to hold this rascal, Robinson said, clasping the 300 kg mass. Then, noting Noguchi perched on the arm, he joked: Youve got a ticket to ride.

 Noguchi deposited the gyroscope onto a holding rack while the new gyroscope was hauled into place on the stations truss. The failed instrument was packed into the shuttles cargo bay for engineers to analyse after the ships return to Earth.

 Before returning to the shuttles airlock, the astronauts prepared some tools that may be needed for an unscheduled heat shield repair during the third spacewalk on Wednesday, or possibly a fourth outing on Friday.

 Nasa managers are trying to decide if Discoverys heat shield needs work before the shuttle attempts Nasas first landing since the destruction of Columbia and the deaths of its seven astronauts on February 1, 2003.

 Columbia had been struck by a piece of falling foam insulation during launch. The impact damaged heat panels on the ships wing and as the shuttle blasted through the atmosphere for landing, superheated gases breached the ships wing, triggering the breakup of the vehicle over Texas. After the accident, Nasa adopted new procedures, spent $1 billion on safety upgrades and built equipment to inspect the shuttle while it is in orbit.

 Debris fell from Discoverys tank as well, prompting Nasa to ground its shuttle fleet, halting plans to resume space station servicing and construction until additional repairs are made.

 New in-flight inspections mandated after the Columbia disaster showed two bits of material protruding from the shuttles belly, which could cause overheating during the atmospheric re-entry.

 Managers were expected to decide later whether to have the spacewalkers venture to Discoverys belly to remove or trim the two protruding strips, known as gap fillers.

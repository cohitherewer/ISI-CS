 Beer to beat drowsiness

 PHILIP SHERWELL 

 Washington, Feb. 6: A beer that contains the equivalent of half the caffeine in a normal cup of coffee has gone on sale in the US after successful tests in several cities.

 BE, which also contains fruit flavouring, ginseng and guarana, an Amazonian herbal stimulant, is produced by Anheuser-Busch, the Budweiser brewer, and is aimed at younger drinkers who are already used to mixing spirits with energy drinks such as Red Bull. 

 The drink is pronounced ?B to the E? (the B stands for Budweiser and the E for extra) in a play on the sort of mathematical formula not normally heard in a bar late at night. It has an alcohol content of 4.5 per cent, with 54 mg of caffeine thrown in.

 The drink is expected to be exported to Britain if sales go well in America. 

 Indeed, the arrival of a beer that contains its own defence mechanism against drowsiness might be just what some drinkers will need to cope with Britain?s new 24-hour licensing laws.

 The crucial question for would-be consumers, however, is how it tastes. Nathaniel Davis, the brewmaster who created BE, says the drink has an aroma of blackberry, cherry, typical hop and malt flavours, rounded off with a slightly sweet and tart finish that he modestly calls the ?wow factor?.

 There is a possible downside to BE?s stimulating qualities, however: drinkers may simply end up consuming a lot more beer rather than becoming tired and heading home, as they would have done previously. 

 American nutritionists have also pointed out that alcohol and caffeine are both diuretics, meaning that revellers could end up more dehydrated and with worse hangovers.

 Haze clears

 Kuala Selangor (Malaysia)/Jakarta, Aug. 12 (Reuters): Malaysia got a short breathing space today from its worst air pollution crisis in eight years as changing winds scattered acrid smoke from forest fires burning in neighbouring Indonesia.

 The skies cleared over downtown Kuala Lumpurs iconic Petronas Towers and palm trees shivered in breezes that carried away some of the haze that has shrouded the city for a week, although weather officials warned the respite might be brief.

 We do believe there will be a temporary relief, said Wong Teck Kiong of the Malaysian Meteorological Service.

 Rain promised to bring more relief over the weekend, as the wind carried the haze away from central Malaysia towards the countrys eastern states of Trengganu and Kelantan, where visibility had fallen sharply, he said.

 Malaysians flocked to Friday prayers at mosques around the country to pray for a quick end to the crisis. The Prime Minister urged citizens of all faiths to beg for divine intervention to banish the haze that has threatened public health.

 Air pollution readings fell by this evening, with just six areas in the range considered unhealthy, among them the two areas declared emergency zones yesterday. Kuala Lumpur, with a reading of 276, had the most polluted air. Abdullah paved the way for the removal of emergency measures, saying they could be dropped if the pollution readings fell below the 500 level.

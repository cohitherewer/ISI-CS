 Fine Print

 Hot over hair

 Seoul, May 18 (Reuters): South Korean high school students plan to hold more rallies to protest against restrictions on hair length and style in the countrys notoriously regimented education system, an organiser said today.

 Students often face enormous pressure and gruelling hours in the South Korean school system, where failure to get into a handful of prestigious colleges can shatter career prospects.

 But in a rare outburst in this Confucian society, some normally deferential high-school students have tried to draw the line at hair.

 Teachers apply standardised rules to students and that results in harsh measures from teachers, said Lee Jun-haeng, 20, an organiser of a recent protest in the capital Seoul. 

 Who cash

 New York (Reuters): Lets hope My Generation 

is making some serious money. Legendary rock band The Who will play its only US 

performance this year at a charity dinner where tickets are $1,500 apiece, promoters 

said on Tuesday. Tables run as high as $30,000, which include a seat with an honoree, 

promoters said. Honorees include former basketball star Magic Johnson, New York 

Yankees manager Joe Torre, golf legend Arnold Palmer and rocker Jon Bon Jovi. 

The June 13 concert at Gotham Hall will benefit Samsungs Four 

Seasons of Hope, an umbrella charity that donates money to childrens organisations. 

The charity is sponsored by Samsung Electronics America. The Whos hits include 

My Generation and Wont Get Fooled Again and albums Tommy 

and Quadrophenia.

 Dog drive

 San Francisco (Reuters): A national group for owners of Jack Russell terriers may oust members who join other canine clubs to help prevent the breed from evolving into a show dog, a US appeals court ruled on Tuesday. The 9th US circuit Court of appeals affirmed a lower courts dismissal of an anti-trust lawsuit by dissident members against the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America, which aims to preserve the working-dog characteristics of the breed by barring members from registering their dogs with other clubs. The terrier club believes other groups standards for the breed could over time turn the dogs into a show breed, bred for form instead of function. Jack Russell terriers were first bred in England in the 1800s to hunt fox both over and underground.

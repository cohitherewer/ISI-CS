 Storm over BBCs new forecasts

 London, May 17 (Reuters): Storm clouds gathered over the BBC today after it received scores of complaints about new graphics it uses for television weather forecasts.

 Underlining how Britons like nothing better than talking about the weather, viewers bombarded a BBC website complaining about the graphics, which replace the old stationary cloud and rain symbols with shadow sweeping across the country and a birds eye camera which zooms in on different regions.

 Many said the new format was confusing and some complained that by trying the show the curve of the earths surface, the BBC had made it difficult to see what was going on in Scotland and northern England.

 Others complained that the BBC had turned Englands green and pleasant land a muddy shade of brown. Appalling. What an absolute mess, wrote one viewer, Jim from Glasgow. 

 Another viewer, Ann Walker, from Stratford-on-Avon in central England said: My husband who suffers from vertigo found the constant movement made him feel quite dizzy.

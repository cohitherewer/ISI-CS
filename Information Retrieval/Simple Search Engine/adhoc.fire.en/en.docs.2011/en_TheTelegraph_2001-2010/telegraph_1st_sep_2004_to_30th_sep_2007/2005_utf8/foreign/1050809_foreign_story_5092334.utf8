 Fine Print

 Horror hubby

 Rome, Aug. 8 (Reuters): A Macedonian man left his wife at an Italian service station and only realised he had driven off without her six hours later, news agency Ansa said today.

 The couple, who were travelling with their four-year-old daughter, pulled over for petrol in the coastal city of Pesaro as they were heading back to their home to Germany.

 After filling the tank, the husband drove away ? without noticing that his 30-year-old wife, originally from Georgia, had got out of the car to go to the toilet. The woman, who had no money or documents with her, contacted the police who eventually traced her husband to Milan, some 340 km north of Pesaro, Ansa said.

 The husband told police he hadnt missed his wife because she always sat in the back of the car with their daughter.

 Fish hotel

 Chicago (Reuters): At Chicagos newest downtown hotel, guests can swim out, but will they ever leave? Friends of the Chicago River, an environmental group, cut the ribbon on Saturday on the citys first fish hotel, at the south end of the citys Magnificent Mile shopping district. The hotel is actually a series of small gardens ? some floating and others submerged ? densely planted with wetland vegetation that should be more inviting to urban fish species than the rivers bare, steel walls. 

 Rosie role

Donnell will star opposite actor and playwrightHarvey Fierstein in the musical running at the Minskoff Theatre in Manhattan. Fierstein who is playing Tevye, a milkman, will be joined by Donnell as his wife Golde.

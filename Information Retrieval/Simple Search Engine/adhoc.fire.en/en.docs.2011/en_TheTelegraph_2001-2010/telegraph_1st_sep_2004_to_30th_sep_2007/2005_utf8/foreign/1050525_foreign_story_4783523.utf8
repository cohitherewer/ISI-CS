 Fine Print

 Bottle note

 Liverpool, May 24 (Reuters): A message in a bottle could prove more useful in an emergency than a phone or Internet connection.

 The city council in Liverpool, northern England, is encouraging elderly or ill people to store crucial medical information ? such as their prescription or doctors details ? in a bottle in the fridge for easy access by emergency services.

 If you live on your own and anything happens to you, people say the best place to put your medical information is in the fridge, councillor Marilyn Fielding said today.

 Tight tie

 Tokyo (Reuters): Japans top government 

 spokesperson turned fashion trendsetter on Tuesday when 

 he doffed his tie as part of a Cool Biz campaign 

 to get men to dress down to save energy. Sartorially conservative 

 government workers and politicians are being encouraged 

 to leave off coats and ties between June 1 and September 

 30 so that air conditioner thermostats can be set higher 

 to save energy. Sporting a light blue shirt and navy trousers 

 at a news conference in place of his usual dark suit, chief 

 cabinet secretary Hiroyuki Hosoda presented pamphlets showing 

 a variety of options for the tieless look. Were 

 supposed to dress this way from June 1st, so Ive given 

 it a try, said Hosoda.

 Bug bear

 Zurich (Reuters): A giant dominatrix teddy bear wearing a leather mask and brandishing handcuffs has been banned from sober Zurichs street display of man-sized model bears, the projects artistic director said on Tuesday. While tourists pose for snaps next to a brightly-painted and benign array of models such as the schoolteacher bear and the skier bear, Baervers ? a pun on the German for perverse ? has been deemed too steamy for the financial capitals streets. This bear is perverse, dominatrix and hardcore. We had to ban it because of the children, Beat Seeberger-Quin, the projects art director, said.

 Scary doc

 Tehran (AFP): A pair of scissors and 

 four needles have been recovered from inside the belly of 

 an Iranian woman six years after she gave birth by Caesarean 

 section, the Iran newspaper reported on Tuesday. 

 The report said the unnamed woman from the western town 

 of Marivan in Kurdistan province had complained of chronic 

 abdominal pains ? prompting the discovery of leftover tools 

 in her tummy. The doctor who performed the caesarean is 

 now facing legal action, the paper said.

 Cheney to undergo surgery

 Washington, Sept. 17 (Reuters): Vice-president Dick Cheney will undergo elective surgery next weekend to treat an aneurysm behind his right knee and it will involve a short hospital stay, his office said yesterday.

 Cheney, 64, has had a history of heart trouble, including a fourth heart attack shortly after the contested presidential election in November 2000.

 Steve Schmidt, counsel to the vice-president, said the aneurysm was in the artery behind the right knee and was discovered earlier this year during a routine checkup. It is a condition that needs to be addressed so as not to be a problem over time, Schmidt said.

 The procedure will be performed under local anaesthetic and take place next weekend. The procedure will involve a short hospital stay. 

 The vice-president will return to work shortly thereafter, he said. 

 He said more details would be released next week about the procedure.

 An aneurysm is a bulging section in the wall of a blood vessel that has become stretched out and thin. Where the wall of the blood vessel bulges out, it becomes weaker and may burst or rupture, causing bleeding.

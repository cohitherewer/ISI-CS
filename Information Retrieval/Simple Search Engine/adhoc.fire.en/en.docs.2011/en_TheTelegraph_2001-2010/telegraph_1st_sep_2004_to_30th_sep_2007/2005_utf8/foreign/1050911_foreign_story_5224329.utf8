 Charles stepson weds scribe

 Rotherfield Greys (England), Sept. 10 (AP): Five months after his mother Camilla married Prince Charles, food writer Tom Parker Bowles wed fashion journalist Sara Buys today in an English country church ablaze with flowers.

 Charles and the former Camilla Parker Bowles, now Duchess of Cornwall, and Charles sons William and Harry attended the ceremony at St Nicholas church in Rotherfield Greys, a village 65 km west of london.

 The Duchess of Cornwall wore a matching ice-blue silk coat and dress with silver embroidery for her sons wedding. She also sported a pale blue feather headdress, similar to the one she wore at her own marriage.

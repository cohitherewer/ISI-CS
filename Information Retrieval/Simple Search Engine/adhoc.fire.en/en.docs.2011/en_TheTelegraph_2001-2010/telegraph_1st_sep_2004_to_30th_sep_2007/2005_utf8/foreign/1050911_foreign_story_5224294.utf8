 Ophelia regains hurricane strength

 Miami, Sept. 10 (Reuters): The Atlantic storm Ophelia regained hurricane force today as US forecasters placed coastal North and South Carolina under a hurricane watch.

 The watch issued by the National Hurricance Center in Miami cautioned that fierce winds and other hurricane conditions were possible within 36 hours in an area along the southeastern US coast from the Savannah river in South Carolina to Cape Lookout in North Carolina.

 Sustained winds had been gauged as high as 128 kmph within Ophelia, which was near latitude 31.6 north and longitude 76.5 west, or some 350 km east-southeast of Charleston, South Carolina, at 1500 GMT, according to a hurricane centre advisory.

 Ophelia has slowed down and is now moving toward the northeast near 5 kmph, forecasters said. Little motion is expected today with a gradual turn to the west-northwest tomorrow.

 The storm, which has repeatedly weakened and regained strength, had parked off the coast of Florida for three days and lashed the states Atlantic coast with squalls and beach-eating waves.

 There had been concern as Ophelia formed that it could threaten the U.S. Gulf Coast, which is recovering from the Aug. 29 strike by the much more powerful Hurricane Katrina.

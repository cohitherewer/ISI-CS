 Musharraf attack plan foiled: Pak

 Pervez Musharraf

 Islamabad, May 6 (Reuters): Pakistani intelligence officials said today they had foiled a new conspiracy to kill President Pervez Musharraf with a series of arrests, including the capture of al Qaidas third most senior commander.

 US agents and Pakistani authorities were interrogating al Qaida Abu Faraj Farj al Liby, one of Osama bin Ladens top lieutenants, after he was run to ground in the rugged North-West Frontier Province on Monday, officials said. 

 But they say it was the recapture this week of Mushtaq Ahmed that led to a swoop in Lahore on Wednesday that netted eight people planning a fresh assassination hit on Musharraf.

 A ninth was picked up in Lahore yesterday morning. They all belonged to Jaish-e-Mohammed, a Sunni militant group that has forged links with al Qaida.

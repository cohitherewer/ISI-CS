 William set on finance future

 William

 London, June 27 (Reuters): Prince William, second in line to the British throne, may be headed for a US investment bank when he works for a city financial house for a month late this year, according to bookmakers today.

 Betting firm Cantor Index has opened a market on the likely destination of the 23-year-old prince, with Merrill Lynch and the investment arm of JP Morgan Chase emerging among the favourites.

 The asset management industry is seen as a likely track for the young geography graduate given his potential interest in family trusts and the long-standing links between the British monarchy and charitable work, bankers said.

 In its list of Runners and Riders, the city bookmaker had Merrill Lynch at five to four odds, in part because family friend Edward van Cutsem already works in its investment management arm. We of course would be happy to accommodate him, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch said.

 Merrill Lynch Investment Management is also one of the biggest managers of charitable funds including the Princes Trust, which was founded by Prince Charles.

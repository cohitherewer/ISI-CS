 Zarqawi wounded: Report 

 London, May 15 (PTI): Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Iraqs most wanted terrorist with a ?13-million bounty on his head, was seriously wounded and briefly treated at a hospital in Iraq last week before he was driven away by his men, a British daily reported today.

 The doctor, who claimed to have treated him, told an Iraqi reporter in the western city of Ramadi that Zarqawi, also described as al Qaida leader Osama bin Ladens emir in Iraq, was bleeding heavily when he was brought into hospital on Wednesday, The Sunday Times reported.

 After treating his wounds, the doctor tried to persuade him to remain in hospital, but the Jordanian-born terrorists minders drove him away, it said. 

 He was bleeding heavily and his escorts were well dressed with a look about them that was different from the casualties and family members we had been receiving from the al-Qaim offensive, the doctor, who recognised Zarqawi from his photograph on television, was quoted as saying by the paper.

 Last week, us forces launched an offensive near al-qaim in iraq and claimed to have killed scores of insurgents.

 I treated his injury and asked that he remain in hospital for further observations and told him that we would have to register him and take down his name and details. But he became very nervous and agitated. He refused and told me he would not be staying.

 The three men with him asked me politely that he be allowed to leave hospital immediately and that i supply them with a prescription and a list of medication that he may need, the doctor, who was not named, was quoted as saying. Pti hsr kim 05151153 del

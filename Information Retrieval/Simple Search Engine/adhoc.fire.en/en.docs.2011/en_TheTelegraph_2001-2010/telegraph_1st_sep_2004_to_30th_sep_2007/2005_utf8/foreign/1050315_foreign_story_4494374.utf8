 President not on Rice menu

 ALEC RUSSELL

 Condoleezza Rice

 Washington, March 14: US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice said yesterday that she would not run for the presidency in 2008, shattering the hopes of a growing number of Republicans that she could be their dream candidate.

 Since her polished debut on the world stage last month, Rice has attracted plaudits across the political spectrum, fuelling excitement on a range of Republican websites that are pushing her to become the first black and first female President.

 Speculation that she was considering her chances of succeeding her boss, President George W. Bush, peaked at the weekend when she talked at length about her stance on abortion, a key issue for Republicans.

 But yesterday, in a series of appearances on the influential morning television talk shows, she played down the speculation. ?I don?t know how many ways to say no, so let me just say it. I don?t have any desire to run for President. I don?t intend to. I won?t do it,? she told ABC television.

 ?I won?t. How?s that? Is that categorical enough??

 With vice-president Dick Cheney ruling himself out of contention, there is no front-runner to take the baton from Bush, and Rice?s supporters see her as the only person to stop Hillary Clinton, if the former First Lady decided to run.

 In an interview with the Washington Times over the weekend, Rice refused to rule out her standing for the Presidency and gave a detailed insight into her views on abortion, a litmus for the Right-wing who are suspicious of her ?mildly pro-choice? stance.

 She said that Bush was ?in exactly the right place? on abortion, namely to ?respect the culture of life? and make abortion ?as rare a circumstance as possible?.

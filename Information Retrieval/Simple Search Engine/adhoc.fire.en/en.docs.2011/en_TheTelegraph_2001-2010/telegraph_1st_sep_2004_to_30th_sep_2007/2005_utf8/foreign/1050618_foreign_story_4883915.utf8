 UK faces cyber threat

 London, June 17: Cyber-security officials in Britain issued an unusually dire alert yesterday, warning that hackers are targeting e-mail-borne viruses against government agencies and high-profile British corporations with the aim of stealing sensitive and lucrative data.

 The sophisticated attacks appear to be custom-made for each target, focusing specifically on people who work with commercially or economically sensitive data.

 The attackers write the e-mails so that they appear to originate from trusted contacts, news agencies or government departments, using distribution lists to target large numbers of recipients with similar interests, the report said.

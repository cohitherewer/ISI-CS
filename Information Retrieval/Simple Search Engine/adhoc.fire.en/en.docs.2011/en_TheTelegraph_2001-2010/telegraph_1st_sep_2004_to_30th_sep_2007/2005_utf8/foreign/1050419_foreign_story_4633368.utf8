 Kathmandu, April 18: Continuing their campaign for closure of all private schools in Nepal, Maoist rebels bombed two schools in western Nepal damaging buildings and causing serious injuries to three students.

 The twin attacks came as educational institutions in the Kathmandu valley defied the Maoist closure demand and started a new academic year today.

 The rebels detonated a powerful bomb at Jaya Bageshwori Boarding Higher Secondary School, the largest private school in the Nepalgunj area, late last night. 

 According to the school principal Bidhya Man Rajbhandari, a group of heavily- armed Maoists detonated the bomb at the school?s computer centre causing serious damage to six rooms. Eighteen computers were destroyed. However, there were no casualties. The Nepalgunj school is the best in western Nepal with more than 1000 students on its rolls. 

 In another incident, three students were severely injured when rebels hurled a bomb in the Bal Kalyan Primary School at Khara in Rukum district.

 According to a report in a local Nepali daily, the Maoists entered the school premises and threw the bomb at students who were busy with their classes. The injured students are being treated at Bheri Zonal Hospital in Nepalgunj.

 In Kathmandu, schools affiliated to the Private and Boarding School?s Organisation of Nepal (PABSON) defied the threats issued by the Maoist students? wing and started new classes today.

 However, schools outside the valley, in Kavre, Nuwakot and Dhading districts, remained closed. ?The schools in the western and far-western region have been hit the most,? a PABSON official said adding that a circular had been sent to all districts to open schools within the first week of the start of the new Nepali year. 

 There are over 9,000 private schools across Nepal which have more than 1.5 million students on their rolls. The Maoist-affiliated All Nepal National Independent Students Union (Revolutionary) had called for the closure of all private schools demanding free education up to high school. 

 No talks: Prachanda

 Elusive Maoist rebel leader Prachanda has ruled out peace talks or a ceasefire with the government, predicting that the nine-year-old war would see the Maoists come to power soon. ?Right now, we do not see any possibility of talks with these mediaeval and barbaric feudal autocrats,? he said.

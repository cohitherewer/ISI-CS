 Di last-minute car switch

 PHILIP JOHNSTON

 Princess 

 Diana 

 London, March 16: The mystery over why Diana, Princess of Wales, and her companion Dodi Fayed switched cars in Paris on the night they died was reactivated last night with the release of government papers.

 Official communications in the immediate aftermath of the crash suggested that the car in which they were due to travel broke down, forcing them to use another driven by Henri Paul, the deputy head of hotel security, who was also killed. Tests later showed he was three times the legal alcohol limit.

 The first suggestion that the car had broken down was made in a memo to the Prime Minister sent a few hours after the Princess died. It read: ?The Princess and Dodi al-Fayed arrived at the Paris Ritz yesterday afternoon. They were immediately subject to media attention and when they left the hotel late last night they were surrounded by a number of journalists. They tried to leave quickly but the first hire car failed to start.?

 This version of events was repeated by Sir Michael Jay, the British ambassador to Paris, in a letter to Robin Cook, the foreign secretary. He said: ?Because, apparently, their getaway car failed to start they got into another nearby car driven by a Ritz driver.?

 However, a few weeks later, in a more considered appraisal of the accident, Sir Michael said they switched cars ?following a last-minute change of plan aimed at diverting the waiting paparazzi?.

 The papers, released by the cabinet office following requests made under the Freedom of Information Act, are likely to rekindle the conspiracy theories surrounding the death.

 It was known that the couple had changed cars but it has long been assumed that this was because Fayed ordered the switch in order to avoid the waiting photographers. 

 Trevor Rees-Jones, Fayed?s bodyguard and the sole survivor of the crash, said in his memoirs that Fayed was concerned that the Princess should get back to his apartments without being harassed by photographers. Instead of using their usual chauffeur, he made a last-minute arrangement with Paul to drive a car from the back of the hotel to put the photographers off the scent.

 The documents also detail how Mohamed Fayed, the Harrods boss and father of Dodi, had engaged a pathologist to challenge the results of the tests. 

 This resulted in a third test involving the ?medically more conclusive sample of fluid from the white of the eye?, which confirmed the alcohol level.

 Fine Print

 Clinton condoms

 Beijing, Sept. 21 (AFP): A condom maker in southern Chinas Guangdong province is marketing its products under Clinton and Lewinsky brand names and has registered the names as trademarks, state press said.

 The Guangzhou Haojian Bio-science Co. is selling its wares under the Chinese spelling of the names that read as Kelintun and Laiwensiji, the New Express said yesterday. The names in China are easily recognisable as former President Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. The Clinton brand is set to be the companys top product selling for some 30 yuan ($3.7) for a pack of 12. 

 Shrek poll

 Warsaw (Reuters): Poles still wondering 

 whom to back in Sundays general election can now vote 

 for a fairy tale candidate. Stanislaw Szrek, pronounced 

 Shrek in Polish, does not resemble the friendly, 

 green ogre in DreamWorks film called Shrek, 

 but he is receiving just as much publicity in Polish media. 

 We published the electoral list and I became famous 

 overnight, Szrek said.

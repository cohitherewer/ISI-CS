 Brown claims centre ground in PM pitch

 Brighton (England), Sept. 26 (Reuters): Gordon Brown, British finance minister and Tony Blairs successor-in-waiting, vowed today to press ahead with free market reforms as he made an overt pitch to become Britains next leader.

 Browns speech to his Labour partys annual conference was prime ministerial in sweep, ranging from Iraq and Afghanistan to promising Britons he would safeguard their prosperity and equip them to compete with the new tiger economies of China and India.

 He offered little but rhetoric to those in the party ? in power since 1997 ? who hoped he would mark a return to more traditional, Left-wing values as leader but vowed to deepen public service reforms started by Blair.

 The only future of the Labour party is as the party of reform, Brown told party members at the gathering in the south coast seaside town of Brighton.

 Blair, despite being dogged by the Iraq war, won a third straight election for Labour in May. He has said he will not run for office again and has promised a smooth power transfer.

 The outbreak of peace between the two men ? sown by Browns pivotal role in Mays election victory ? should allow the ruling party to avoid the bitter leadership battles that have so hurt their main Conservative opponents.

 I believe Tony Blair deserves huge credit not just for winning three elections but leading the Labour party for more than a decade, Brown said.

 And in the same way, he deserves credit for leading us through difficult and challenging years, he also deserves credit for ... challenging us as a party to begin to plan ahead.

 Insiders do not expect Blair to go before 2007 but a number of ministers have openly named Brown as his unchallenged heir in a succession of carefully choreographed statements.

 In a sign of his widening ambitions, Brown said he would visit West Asia next month to look at ways to rebuild Palestinian infrastructure and help the peace process.

 He even addressed the Iraq war which has cost Blair so much popularity, a rare intervention for the finance minister. In Afghanistan and Iraq and at home we will at all times have the strength and resolution so that there is no hiding place for terrorists, or those who finance terrorism, he said.

 Bookmakers William Hill quickly made Brown the hottest of favourites to inherit Blairs crown but his greatest strength ? a record of eight years of solid economic growth ? could yet prove his Achilles Heel.

 He signalled last week that growth this year would likely fall well short of his 3 to 3.5 per cent forecast.

 Phone saviour

 Mexico City, July 14 (Reuters): A group of stranded illegal immigrants facing death in the parched Arizona desert saved themselves by using a cellphone they found to call rescue services, the US border patrol said yesterday.

 The group got lost in the desert near Arivaca, south of Tucson, Arizona, on Wednesday after their guide abandoned them during a four-day trek across the border from Mexico.

 Lost and low on water, they used a cellphone they found in their guides bag to dial 911. Rescuers dispatched helicopters and located the group in the desert shortly after sunset.

 Potter trick

 Paris (AFP): While Harry Potter has 

 cast a spell over children worldwide, to the delight of 

 local English teachers, many young readers in France seem 

 willing to cross the language barrier on their magical journey 

 with the young wizard. Bookshops in France are preparing 

 for a flood of Potter fans following the release of author 

 J.K. Rowlings sixth novel Harry Potter and the 

 Half-Blood Prince. The English edition of the book is 

 to be released at exactly one minute past midnight tomorrow 

 morning. In June 2003, eager French readers snapped up no 

 less than 22,000 copies of the english edition of the previous 

 Harry Potter book in the first week it became available.

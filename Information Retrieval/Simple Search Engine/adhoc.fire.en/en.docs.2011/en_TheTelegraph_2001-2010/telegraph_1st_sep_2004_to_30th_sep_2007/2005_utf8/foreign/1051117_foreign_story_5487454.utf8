 Punch party

 London, Nov. 16 (Reuters): Perhaps inspired by the presence of the baddest man on the planet in their midst, guests at a British boxing dinner for Mike Tyson launched into a mass punch-up.

 Police said they were called to a large fight at the Heritage Hotel in Derby, central England, where Tyson had appeared to launch a four-date promotional tour of Britain.

 Among the guests at the black tie function last night, where tickets cost 127 pounds ($220) a head, was former British heavyweight champion Frank Bruno.

 Atom map

 New York (PTI): A detailed map once 

 used by the crew aboard Enola Gay, which dropped 

 the atom bomb over Hiroshima, was sold for $72,000 at Christies 

 auction house in New York. The map, printed on weave cloth 

 for durability, was carried on the flight by co-pilot Robert 

 A. Lewis, who had carefully drawn arrows of the B-29s 

 flight path to Hiroshima to drop the nuclear device and 

 the return journey. 

 Measuring 77 cm, the map depicts the East China Sea, which includes southern Japan, and had been prepared by the army map service in February 1945.

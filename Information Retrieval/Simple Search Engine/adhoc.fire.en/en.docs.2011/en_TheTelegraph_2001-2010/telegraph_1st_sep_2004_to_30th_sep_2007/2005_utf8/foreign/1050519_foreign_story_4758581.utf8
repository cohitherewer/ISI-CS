 Pervez lecture sparks protests

 IMTIAZ GUL

 Pervez Musharraf

 Islamabad, May 18: A lecture on unity and settlement of differences to members of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (Quaid-e-Azam) by President Pervez Musharraf has sparked a new controversy with leading Opposition parties questioning his direct interference in politics.

 A breakaway faction of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League, the PML (Q) is in disarray after some party members developed serious differences with their leadership on a host of issues.

 The differences began to surface after PML (Q) chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussein terminated the membership of former Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali. The situation in the party worsened to such an extent that Musharraf had to convene a meeting on Monday and lecture the party members to behave themselves.

 While asking the party members to sort out their differences, Musharraf also allayed their fears, telling them that the PML (Q) was his party. 

 Recently, Musharraf had himself triggered speculations by conceding that he is in constant touch with the PPP, which is considered as a moderate political force, capable of carrying forward his agenda of enlightened moderation.

 Interestingly, Jamali, who has been quite disturbed over Husseins statement that he (Jamali) is no longer a member of the PML after resigning as secretary general on his appointment as the Prime Minister in October 2002, kept quiet during Mondays meeting of the party members and Musharraf.

 However, he met Musharraf and told him about his differences with Hussein, who was instrumental in splitting Sharifs PML five years ago.

 The leading Opposition parties are also unhappy with the performance of the PML (Q) and Musharrafs interference in political affairs.

 General Musharrafs increasing interactions with the politicians constitute as an interference in political affairs, PML secretary general Siddique-ul-Farooque said.

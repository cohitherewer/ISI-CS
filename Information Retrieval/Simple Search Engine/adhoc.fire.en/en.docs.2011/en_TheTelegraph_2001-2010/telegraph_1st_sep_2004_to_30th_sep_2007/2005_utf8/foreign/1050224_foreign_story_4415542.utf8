 Harvard chief vows to change

 Cambridge (Massachusetts), Feb. 22 (Reuters): Harvard University president Lawrence Summers pledged yesterday to listen more carefully and open a ?new chapter? in his dealings with faculty as he sought to defuse a controversy sparked by his remarks on women.

 In his second meeting with undergraduate faculty in eight days, Summers showed no sign of bowing to demands that he resign. Instead, the former US treasury secretary ? whose abrupt style has won both praise and contempt since he took over as president of the Ivy League university in 2001 ? pledged to change his ways.

 ?To start, I pledge to you that I will seek to listen more ? and more carefully ? and to temper my words and actions in ways that convey respect and help us work together more harmoniously,? Summers said in opening remarks to the meeting, which was closed to the outside media.

 ?No doubt I will not always get things right. But I am determined to set a different tone,? he said. Copies of his remarks were provided to journalists.

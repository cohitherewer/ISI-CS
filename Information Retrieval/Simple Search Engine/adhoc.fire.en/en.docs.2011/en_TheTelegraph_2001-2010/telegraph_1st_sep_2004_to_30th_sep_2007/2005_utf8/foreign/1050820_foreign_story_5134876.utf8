 Parties accuse Pervez govt of fraud

 Pervez Musharraf: Poll trouble

 Islamabad, Aug. 19 (Reuters): Opposition officials accused President Pervez Musharrafs government of electoral fraud today as votes were tallied after the first round of voting in Pakistans local elections.

 At least 15 people were killed and hundreds injured in sporadic violence during yesterdays voting for district councillors that will help determine the make up of the government that emerges from general elections in 2007.

 The three-phase local elections are officially being held on a non-party basis, but factions have openly backed candidates to build their power bases ahead of the general election.

 Analysts have said the polls could determine whether Musharraf incorporates liberal opponents in a future government.

 However, the best-selling Jang newspaper said preliminary unofficial results showed pro-Musharraf parties ahead in the most populous Punjab province and Pakistans biggest city, Karachi, and Islamist parties leading in regions they already dominated.

 The main liberal Opposition party, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) of self-exiled former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, accused the government of massive irregularities.

 Qaim Ali Shah, a member of the PPPs central executive committee, said the polls had been rigged in a naked and brutal manner.

 The Election Commissioner is saying there was 50 per cent turnout. Its strange he is saying this when the counting is yet to be completed. It appears everything was predetermined.

 Another senior PPP official, Taj Haider, put the turnout at no more than 12 per cent. Its a different thing how many votes go into the ballot box and how many come out, he said. 

 A senior member of the Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, the six-party religious alliance, made similar accusations. Some ballot boxes were full even before the polling started, said Naimatullah Khan, a former district chief of Karachi.

 UK rights sermon to Beijing

 Beijing, Sept. 6 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Tony Blair urged China today to embrace greater political freedom and make progress on human rights, saying the world needed to know what kind of economic powerhouse it was dealing with.

 Blairs comments in Beijing followed a second day of talks with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and the signing of banking and aeroplane deals worth around $1.5 billion.

 What we want to see is the development of human rights and greater democracy, not just because it is our system but because we think thats the best way that economic and political development go hand in hand, Blair said.

 He said Wen had acknowledged during their talks that political change must accompany economic growth but added that no timetable had been discussed.

 Blair also met Wen for five hours yesterday because Britain holds the rotating presidency of the 25-member European Union.

 British officials said an EU deal with China clinched yesterday to end a row over Chinas surging textile exports showed the difficulty of setting up barriers against a country whose cheap labour and modern factories had made it the workshop of the world.

 Blair said: Its not that people resent China, but theyve got a question mark because they see an economic powerhouse and ask, Will this developing economy be matched by political development and in the field of human rights? 

 With China set to become the worlds second-largest economy in a decade, global stability depended on the willingess of Europe and others to keep markets open and rise to the challenge of China rather than treating it as a threat, he said.

 At the same time China has to understand that they (the West and others) see a new China emerging and want to know what kind of country they are dealing with, he said.

 Wen said yesterday Chinas people, who have only tightly controlled elections at the village level, may get the chance to directly elect their leaders at township level in several years.

 The Communist Party controls the selection of all top officials and Chinas leaders have ruled out Western-style democracy as an option for political reform, which ground to a halt after the army crushed pro-democracy protests centred on Tiananmen Square in June 1989.

 But Blair said: Theres an unstoppable momentum towards greater political freedom, progression in human rights. I think theres an understanding that should happen. Whether it does happen or not, obviously only time will tell.

 The business deals signed during Blairs two-day visit underlined the main theme of his trip ? that Chinas cheap, industrious workforce poses stern competition but that its 1.3 billion-strong market also offers rich rewards.

 Airbus, the European aircraft maker in which Britains BAE Systems Plc. has a 20 per cent stake, signed a deal to sell 10 A330 jets to China Southern Air for $1.5 billion before discounts, while British bank Standard Chartered sealed the purchase of a 19.99 per cent stake in Bohai Bank.

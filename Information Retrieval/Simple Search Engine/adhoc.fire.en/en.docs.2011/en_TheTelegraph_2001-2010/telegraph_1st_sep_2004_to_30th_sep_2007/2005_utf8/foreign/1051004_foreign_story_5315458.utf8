 Speed class

 London, Oct. 3 (Reuters): Some heavy-footed British motorists caught speeding may be offered driving classes as an alternative to fines or prosecution, according to plans outlined by police chiefs today.

 A National Speed Awareness Course will aim to allow police officers the opportunity to take account a drivers motoring history.

 There may be circumstances where driver education is a better deterrent to future speeding than fines or penalty points, said Richard Brunstrom, chief constable of North Wales police.

 EU heat on Iran leader

 Berlin, Dec. 9 (Reuters): Germany, Russia and Switzerland joined the EU today in a chorus of condemnation of the Iranian President for suggesting the Holocaust might not have taken place and that Israel should be moved to Europe.

 The remarks by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, at a news conference in the Saudia Arabian city of Mecca yesterday, follow his call in October for Israel to be wiped off the map, which also sparked broad international criticism.

 The German foreign ministry said it had summoned Irans ambassador to protest, and ministry spokesman Martin Jaeger said this was being done to show how seriously Berlin was taking the comments.

 When one summons an ambassador, then you signal the start of something in diplomacy, that there are grounds for serious discussion, Jaeger said.

 Irans official news agency Irna quoted Ahmadinejad as saying of the Nazi Holocaust: Some European countries insist on saying that Hitler killed millions of innocent Jews in furnaces...

 Although we dont accept this claim, if we suppose it is true, our question for the Europeans is: is the killing of innocent Jewish people by Hitler the reason for their support to the occupiers of Jerusalem? he said.

 If the Europeans are honest they should give some of their provinces in Europe ? like in Germany, Austria or other countries ? to the Zionists and the Zionists can establish their state in Europe.

 Britain, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency and has played a key role in European attempts to persuade Tehran to give up its nuclear ambitions, said such comments had no place in civilised political debate.

 Iran is unique in opposing a resolution to the Arab-Israel dispute based on the principle of two states living side by side in peace and security, foreign secretary Jack Straw said. The Russian foreign ministry said: It is difficult to comment on such unacceptable remarks.

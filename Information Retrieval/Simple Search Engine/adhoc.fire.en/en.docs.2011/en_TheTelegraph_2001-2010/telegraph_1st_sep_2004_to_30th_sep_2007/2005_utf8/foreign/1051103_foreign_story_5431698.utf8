 Fine Print

 Costly painting

 New York, Nov. 2 (Reuters): It was a big night for Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Christies, when the auction house sold the artists painting of a laundress for a record-smashing $22,416,000 yesterday.

 The Laundress, the most expensive painting of the annual autumn art auctions at Christies and rival Sothebys, also achieved the highest price at the first of two weeks of critical sales.

 The moving portrait of a local woman gazing out a window from 1886-87 easily eclipsed the old record for Toulouse-Lautrec of $14,522,500, set in 1997.

 Star break

 who broke into actress Jennifer Anistons rented Malibu

 climbed over a 2.7 metre-high fence and entered Anistons 

 house where he was confronted by her staff. The former Friends 

 star was away filming in Chicago at the time and was not 

 in court on Tuesday. Hesterbey pleaded no contest to a burglary 

 charge and was ordered to stay away from the actor for 10 

 years.

 Monopoly forced into makeover

 London, June 17 (Reuters): Monopoly, the world famous board game in which players try to drive each other into bankruptcy, has been forced into a makeover by soaring property prices.

 Parker, the company which makes the game, issued a 70th anniversary edition yesterday complete with new locations and updated property prices to reflect the way the worlds great cities have evolved since 1935 when it was invented.

 Gone are the upmarket areas of Park Lane and Mayfair, which, in the original edition, could be bought for ?350 and ?400 respectively.

 Instead, the most expensive locations in the Monopoly Here and Now edition are Canary Wharf and The City, both business districts, which sell for 10,000 times those prices. The Strand has been replaced by the London Eye and Vine Street has given way to the Tate Modern art gallery.

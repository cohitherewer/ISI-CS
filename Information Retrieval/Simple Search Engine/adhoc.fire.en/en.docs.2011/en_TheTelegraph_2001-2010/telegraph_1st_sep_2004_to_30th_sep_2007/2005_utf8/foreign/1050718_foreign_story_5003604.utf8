 Sandra Bullock

 Los Angeles, July 17 (Reuters): Actor Sandra Bullock, star of Miss Congeniality, has married reality TV star Jesse James at a ranch in the California wine country near Santa Barbara.

 Several hundred people, including actors Jamie Lee Curtis, Regina King and William Shatner, attended the ceremony yesterday in the picturesque Santa Ynez valley, according to websites for syndicated TV show Entertainment Tonight, and People and US Weekly magazines.

 It was the first marriage for Bullock, who will turn 41 later this month. She was previously engaged to actor Tate Donovan and romantically linked to actor Matthew McConaughey. James, 35, has been married twice before and has three children. He stars in Discovery Channels Monster Garage.

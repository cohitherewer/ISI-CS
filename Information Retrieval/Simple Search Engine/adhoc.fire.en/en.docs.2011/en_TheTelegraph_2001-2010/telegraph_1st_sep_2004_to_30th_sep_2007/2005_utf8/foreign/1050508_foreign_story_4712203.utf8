 Hard times for cadet Harry

 THOMAS HARDING AND CATRIONA DAVIES

 Prince Harry

 London, May 7: In the words 

 of those who have gone before, Prince Harry is ?in for a 

 bit of a shock? when he starts officer cadet training at 

 Sandhurst tomorrow.

 At 5.30 am, when he might normally be leaving nightclubs, he will be woken by the banging of dustbins then spend the next hour making his bed to within a millimetre of perfection.

 The first five weeks of the 42-week officer training course at the Royal Military Academy near Camberley, Surrey, are likely to be among the toughest in the 20-year-old princes life.

 ?He will quickly understand that the sergeant major will call him sir and Prince Harry will call the sergeant major sir, but both will know who really means it,? said Colonel Tim Collins, the Royal Irish Regiments commanding officer during the Iraq invasion.

 Colonel Collins, who left the academy in 1981, said: ?It will be an immense test. He will have to learn the rules and the value of teamwork.?

 The first term will be the most rigorous. Prince Harry will learn basic soldiering skills, platoon attacks, drill and become familiar with the academys challenging assault course. Perhaps the biggest test will be the five weeks he has to spend away from his girlfriend before the first long weekend ? allowed only if a cadet ?passes off the square? by successfully conducting a number of drills.

 Staying away from alcohol is another key to success, according to former students. Major General Michael Scott, who commanded the Scots Guards during the Falklands War, said: ?Drinking wont help because an immense hangover wont do you much good on the drill square.

 ?The best advice for Prince Harry is to crack on and do his best. Its a wonderful institution that has had high-profile people there before, including King Hussein of Jordan, who was a star.?

 The general, who left Sandhurst in 1960, added: ?Its a fair old shock to the system, but the NCOs are the salt of the earth. They are the sort of people who will look after Prince Harry.?

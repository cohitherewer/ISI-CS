 Moscow powerless, Putin blames baron

 Moscow, May 25 (Reuters): Moscow was plunged into chaos today after a big power outage that President Vladimir Putin blamed on the state-owned electricity monopoly headed by a liberal politician viewed with suspicion by the Kremlin.

 The outage, caused by a fire in a substation, shut the stock exchange, crippled transport and threatened mobile phone links in the sweltering Russian capital.

 Energy minister Viktor Khristenko said the breakdown was caused by a fire and explosion overnight at an electricity substation. There was no evidence of a terrorist attack, he said.

 But Putin, who delayed a provincial trip because of the crisis, pointed the finger at the management of Unified Energy System whose chief executive is Anatoly Chubais, one of the architects of the post-Soviet market revolution whose liberal views sit uneasily with Kremlin hardliners. It is entirely possible to talk about a lack of attention on the part of RAO UES to the current activity of the company.

 They should work not only on global problems about company policy and its restructuring, but also pay attention to current activity, Putin said in televised remarks.

 Chubais, one of Russias best known figures who survived an assassination attempt in March, was quoted as saying he accepted full responsibility for the outage.

 Putin was clearly suggesting that Chubais was spending too much time on his widely-publicised plans for a corporate restructuring of the electricity behemoth and was losing sight of the operational running of the firm.

 Though a leader of the Union of Right Forces party, Chubais quit active politics in 1998 to lead UES. He now heads a company with annual revenues of $21.6 billion and a market capitalisation of $12.4 billion.

 While he has generally refrained from open criticism of Kremlin policy, Chubais was one of the few public figures inside Russia to condemn the prosecution of oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky who is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.

 Moscows main MICEX foreign exchange and share market stopped trading for several hours because, though it had power, many of its clients did not. It reopened later in the afternoon.

 The underground (metro) system ground to a halt, leaving more than 20,000 passengers stranded below ground in the capital which is experiencing a heatwave with temperatures around 30 degrees Celsius.

 The passengers were evacuated after an hour, Svetlana Tsareva, head of the metros press office, said.

 There was a fire and explosion at the Chagino substation, said Khristenko, referring to a locality southeast of Moscow. 

 As a result of the explosion several transformers were destroyed.

 He put it down to the age of the Soviet-era substation, built in 1963.

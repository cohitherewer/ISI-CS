 Bianca balance

 Tehran, Sept. 13 (Reuters): Back in 1968, Mick Jagger had plenty of Sympathy for the Devil, but his first wife Bianca is far more critical of The Great Satan and fears US unwillingness to talk to Iran could lead to conflict.

 Rights campaigner Jagger, the Council of Europes goodwill ambassador, has travelled to Iran with a group called: US Academics for Peace, seeking to ensure the Islamic Republic does not become the next Iraq.

 The group argues the mudslinging rhetoric branding the US as The Great Satan and Iran as part of the axis of evil is one of the first things that has to stop. 

 Jagger admitted it was difficult to juggle criticism of US policy towards Iran with the need to hold Tehran to account on its human rights record.

 I have to walk a very narrow line. On the one hand, we have to condemn illegal war, regime change and pre-emptive strikes, she said in an interview.

 She feared the US could launch strikes against Iran, which it accuses of developing nuclear warheads and sponsoring anti-Israeli militia. Tehran denies the charges.

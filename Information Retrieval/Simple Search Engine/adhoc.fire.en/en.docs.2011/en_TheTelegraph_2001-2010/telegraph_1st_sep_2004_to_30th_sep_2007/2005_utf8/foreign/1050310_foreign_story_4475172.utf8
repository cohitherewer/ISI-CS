 Dan Rather leaves under a cloud

 Dan Rather: Weighing anchor

 New York, March 9 (Reuters): CBS News anchor Dan Rather is all set to sign off for the last time but tributes to the 73-year-old veteran were mixed with sniping after his final months were marred by a scandal that tarnished his reputation.

 One of the three leading US news anchors for the past two decades, Rather described himself as ?a big-game hunter? who took on Presidents from Richard Nixon to George W. Bush.

 For conservatives, he was the epitome of liberal media bias. For many viewers, he was a clean-cut Texan with a quirky turn of phrase that bordered on the bizarre.

 The Washington Post ran a selection of his election comments over the years including such gems as Texas is ?the big enchilada or, if not an enchilada, then a huge taco,? and ?If a frog didn?t have long hind legs, he wouldn?t have squat to jump with.?

 Rival network ABC paid tribute to Rather on its breakfast show. ?A remarkable 24 years in the anchor chair,? said morning anchor Charles Gibson. ABC carried footage of Rather?s lengthy career, from the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and the Vietnam War to Afghanistan and Tiananmen Square in Beijing.

 CBS took out a full page ad in The New York Times to promote a one-hour retrospective to be aired after Rather?s final evening newscast.

 ?CBS proudly salutes our friend and colleague Dan Rather on 24 years as anchor and managing editor of the CBS Evening News,? the ad said.

 Rather?s departure was overshadowed by a discredited report before the 2004 US presidential election questioning Bush?s military service.

 CBS News sacked or requested the resignation of four employees in January after an independent report found ?myopic zeal? led CBS to disregard basic journalism principles when it aired the story saying Bush got special treatment in the Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam War. Rather was criticised but escaped disciplinary action.

 Speaking about the controversy in an ABC interview aired today, Rather said: ?I made a mistake. I didn?t dig hard enough, long enough, didn?t ask enough of the right questions.? 

 He said he was looking forward to returning to full-time reporting. 

 But New York?s Daily News criticised Rather for bravado that columnist Michael Goodwin said was ?more fitting for a fading actor addicted to applause.?

 ?He?s a performer, a stunt man, a celebrity who makes $7 million a year for role playing,? Goodwin wrote.

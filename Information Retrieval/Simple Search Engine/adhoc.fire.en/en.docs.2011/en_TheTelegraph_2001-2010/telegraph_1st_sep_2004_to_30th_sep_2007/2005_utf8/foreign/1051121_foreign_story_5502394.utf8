 Boeing deal

 Beijing, Nov. 20 (PTI): China today displayed its growing economic might by ordering 70 aircraft from American giant Boeing during US President George W. Bushs visit, marking the biggest purchase agreement in the countrys aviation history.

 The China Aviation Supplies Import and Export Group Corporation signed a general purchase agreement with Seattle-based Boeing to buy 70 B-737-700/800 aircraft worth $4 billion.

 Boeing will deliver the planes between 2006 and 2008. Both sides signed the agreement ahead of Chinese President Hu Jintaos talks with Bush.

 The deal is also expected to ease domestic pressure on bush on the trade front. Aircraft exports by the us could help offset a ballooning trade deficit with china, which could top 200 billion us dollars this year, analysts said.

 The signing in beijing is part of a broader deal to supply 150 boeing 737 aircraft. Eighty planes will be delivered only after 2008 and the deal yet to take a final shape, company officials said.

 The agreement unfolded a promising cooperation future between china and the united states in aviation and other fields. Chinas economy has developed rapidly in recent years, so has the aviation industry.

 In the next five years, china will need more aircraft, vice minister of the national development and reform commission, zhang xiaoqing said.

 The agreement will promote sino-us economic and trade development, the official xinhua news agency said. Pti akj tck 11201537 del

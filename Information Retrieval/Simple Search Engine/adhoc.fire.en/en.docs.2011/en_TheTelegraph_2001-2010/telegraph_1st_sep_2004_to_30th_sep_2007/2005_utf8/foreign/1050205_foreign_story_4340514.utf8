 Pocket atlases for press

 London, Feb. 4 (Reuters): With Americans suffering a reputation as geographically challenged, Condoleezza Rice handed out pocket atlases to the US press corps on her first trip abroad as secretary of state.

The souvenir for journalists of her inaugural eight-day, 10-stop trip to Europe and West Asia was also Rice?s way of showing she will travel widely to fulfil her pledge that ?the time for diplomacy is now.?

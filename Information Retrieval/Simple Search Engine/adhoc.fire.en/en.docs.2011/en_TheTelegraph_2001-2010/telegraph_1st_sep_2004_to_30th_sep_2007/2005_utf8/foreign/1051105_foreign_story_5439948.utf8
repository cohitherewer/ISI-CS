 Presidents ratings plunge: Poll

 Washington, Nov. 4 (Reuters): For the first time in his presidency, a majority of Americans questioned President George W. Bushs personal integrity as his approval ratings on key issues fell to new lows in an ABC News/Washington Post poll published yesterday.

 Fewer than half ? 40 per cent ? said Bush was honest and trustworthy. Separately, 67 per cent rated his handling of ethics in government negatively and fewer than half called him a strong leader, another first.

 Sixty per cent of Americans disapproved of his overall job performance, which ABC said was a level unseen since recession chased his father (George Bush) from office. That compared with a 39 per cent approval rating. Even in his own party, just under half of Republicans ? 49 per cent ? now strongly approve of Bushs job performance.

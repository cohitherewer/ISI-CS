 New Vatican slur on Code

 Vatican City, March 26 (Reuters): A Vatican official railed against The Da Vinci Code during a Good Friday sermon in St Peter?s Basilica, saying the hit book was an example of ?literary and artistic parasitism? in a sex-obsessed society.

 In his passionate sermon, Father Raniero Cantalamessa said some people today were ready to believe anything because they no longer believed in God. 

 ?In an unending stream of novels, films and plays, writers manipulate the figure of Christ under cover of imaginary and non-existent new documents and discoveries. This is becoming a fashion,? he said in clear reference to the US author Dan Brown.

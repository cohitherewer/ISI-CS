 Hu faces test on power and protege 

 Hu Jintao

 Beijing, Oct. 8 (Reuters): Chinese Communist Party chief Hu Jintao opens a four-day meeting today seeking to cement his grip on power, pushing his harmonious society platform to cope with rising social tension and possibly naming an heir.

 The plenary session of the 354-member Central Committee is also poised to unveil the 11th five-year plan ? a new roadmap for the worlds seventh-biggest economy that scraps a long-standing policy of faster growth in favour of improving social services and curbing widespread environmental devastation.

 The closed-door plenum at the Soviet-era Jingxi Hotel in Beijing will be a test of whether Hu, 62, has fully consolidated power after replacing Jiang Zemin, 79, as party chief in 2002, state president in 2003 and military chief last year.

 It is Hus first plenum without his influential predecessor holding some form of office, although Jiang has stacked the partys upper echelons with his allies.

 One focus will be on whether Hu can manoeuvre protege Li Keqiang, 50, who cut his teeth in Hus power base, the China Youth League, into the decision-making politburo, which currently has 24 full members and one alternate member.

 Li Keqiang is very likely to become the fifth-generation leader, a source with ties to the leadership said, requesting anonymity.

 Hu is the countrys fourth-generation leader after Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping and Jiang. An independent source said Lis star was rising, despite mediocre performances as provincial party chief in Henan and in the northeastern rustbelt of Liaoning. 

 Hus trusted aide, Ling Jihua, may also move up the political ladder, the sources said. The results of the meeting are not expected to be made public until it closes on Tuesday.

 Hu began to emerge from Jiangs shadow and start his long drive to consolidate power after ending a government cover-up of an outbreak of the SARS virus in 2003.

 He has since sought to portray himself as a man of the people, championing the have-nots left behind by the countrys economic boom.

 He has sought to boost government transparency and instil greater accountability. At the same time, Hu has presided over a clampdown on the media and the Internet.

 The Chinese Communist Party, which has monopolised power since 1949, is obsessed with social stability and has sought to eliminate the threat of colour revolutions like the uprisings that toppled dictatorial regimes.

 Tender thieves

 Valletta (Malta), Oct. 18 (Reuters): Two hooded gunmen who robbed a pharmacy returned an elderly womans purse after she told them it contained the only money she had to buy medicine, Maltese newspapers reported today.

 The two men barged into a pharmacy at Marsascala, a seaside village in the south of the island, yesterday and took 600 Malta liri ($1,700) from the till after threatening the pharmacist with their guns.

 One of them grabbed the purse held by the elderly woman who was waiting to be served, then handed it back after her pleading and rushed out to a waiting motorcycle.

 Pet pamper

 London (Reuters): Fed up with pets that 

 look scruffy, dirty or straggly? Then why not spruce them 

 up with 465 beauty products launched so far this year for 

 the worlds pampered pets, Consumer research group 

 Mintel said on Tuesday. Cats and dogs can now be treated 

 to nail polishes while they can also have their fur dyed 

 gold, orange or pink.

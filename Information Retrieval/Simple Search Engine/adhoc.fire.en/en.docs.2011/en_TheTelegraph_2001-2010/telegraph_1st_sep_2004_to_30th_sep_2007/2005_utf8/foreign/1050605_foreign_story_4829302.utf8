 Zardari suffers heart attack

 Dubai, June 4 (PTI): Former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos husband Asif Ali Zardari today suffered a heart attack and was being treated in a Dubai hospital.

 Doctors attending on Zardari said he underwent an angioplasty and was recovering satisfactorily. 

 Initially, when he was admitted to the hospital complaining of chest pain, doctors thought it was due to spinal injuries suffered during his long imprisonment in Pakistani jails. However, later it was found that he had suffered a heart attack, they said. 

 A Pakistan Peoples Party release in Islamabad said tests have revealed that the main artery of his heart was completely blocked. 

 Zardari will remain in the intensive care unit of the hospital for another 48 hours, it said, adding that earlier a Karachi-based doctor familiar with his spinal problem, was airdashed here to treat Zardari.

 Benazir Bhutto has appealed to the people and party workers to offer special prayers for the speedy recovery of her husband.

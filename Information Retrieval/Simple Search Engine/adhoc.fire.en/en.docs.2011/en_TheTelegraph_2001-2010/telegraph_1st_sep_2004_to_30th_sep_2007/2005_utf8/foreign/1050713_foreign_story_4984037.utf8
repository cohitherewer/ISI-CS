 Row over Rove mounts

 Karl Rove

 Washington, July 12 (Reuters): The White House faced mounting Democratic calls for President George W. Bush to sideline or fire his top political aide Karl Rove yesterday over his involvement in a CIA leak scandal.

 After publicly defending Rove two years ago, the White House responded to the barrage by saying it would not comment at the request of the prosecutors investigating who leaked the identify of CIA agent Valerie Plame.

 The White House promised if anyone was involved in the Valerie Plame affair, they would no longer be in this administration. I trust they will follow through on this pledge, Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said.

 Other Democrats urged Bush to sideline Rove by suspending his access to classified information and said the deputy White House chief of staff should clear the air by answering questions from Congress. Another lawmaker said the intentional disclosure of a covert agents identity amounted to an act of treason.

 The attacks were prompted by reports that Rove was one of the secret sources who spoke to Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper about Plame and her husband, former ambassador Joseph Wilson. The Washington Post yesterday quoted Roves lawyer as saying that his client did not mention Plame by name.

 Plames name was leaked, her diplomat husband said, because of his criticism of the Bush administrations handling of the Iraq war. Roves lawyer was not immediately available to comment.

 The President should immediately suspend Karl Roves security clearances and shut him down by shutting him out of classified meetings or discussions, said Senator Frank Lautenberg, a New Jersey Democrat.

 It is time for the President to keep his word. Karl Rove should be fired and prosecuted to the full extent of the law, said Representative Louise Slaughter of New York. Several other Democrats have also called on Rove to explain his role or resign.

 Representative Henry Waxman, a California Democrat and the ranking minority member of the House Government Reform Committee, called for a congressional hearing to hear testimony from Rove, who is widely seen as the architect of Bushs election victories.

 The recent disclosures about Mr. Roves actions have such serious implications that we can no longer responsibly ignore them. The intentional disclosure of a covert CIA agents identity would be an act of treason, Waxman said.

 White House spokesman Scott McClellan, who was inundated with questions about Rove at his daily news briefing, declined to comment when asked whether Bush continued to have confidence in Rove.

 Shot at, scribe points finger at US

 Rome, March 6 (Reuters): Italian hostage Giuliana Sgrena, shot and wounded after being freed in Iraq, today said US forces may have deliberately targeted her because Washington opposed Italy?s policy of dealing with kidnappers.

 She offered no evidence for the claim that reflected growing anger in Italy over the conduct of the war, which has claimed more than 20 Italian lives, including secret agent Nicola Calipari who rescued her moments before being killed.

 The shooting on Friday has sparked tension with Italy?s US allies and put pressure on Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to take a hard line with President George W. Bush. 

 Speaking from the Rome hospital where she is being treated, Sgrena said the troops may have targeted her because Washington opposes Italy?s reported readiness to pay ransoms to kidnappers. ?The United States doesn?t approve of this (ransom) policy and so they try to stop it in any way possible,? the veteran war reporter, 57, told Sky Italia TV.

 In later comments, Sgrena was less strident: ?You could characterise as an ambush what happens when you are showered with gunfire. If this happened because of a lack of information or deliberately, I don?t know, but even if it was due to a lack of information it is unacceptable.?

 Bush promised a full probe into why troops shot at the Italian car nearing Baghdad airport on Friday evening. Calipari died instantly of a single bullet to the head, doctors said.

 The US military says the car was speeding towards a checkpoint and ignored warning shots, an explanation rejected by Italian government ministers and the driver of the car.

 According to Italy?s leading daily Corriere della Sera, the driver, an unidentified Italian agent, said: ?We were driving slowly, about 40-50 km/h.?

 Parliamentary relations minister Carlo Giovanardi also said he did not believe the US version of events.

 Thousands of people queued up outside Rome?s huge marble Victor Emmanuel monument to pay respects to Calipari where his body is lying in state before a funeral tomorrow. The national outpouring of grief and anger has put pressure on Berlusconi to get answers from Washington on what went wrong before he addresses parliament on the matter on Wednesday.

 Surprise! Rushdie out of Booker shortlist

 London, Sept. 9 (Reuters): British author Julian Barnes was named hot favourite for the Booker Prize yesterday, but the biggest shock was the omission of three literary heavyweights from the shortlist for the prestigious award.

 To the surprise of literary critics, the judges decided not to pick three previous Booker winners ? Salman Rushdie, J.M. Coetzee and Ian McEwan ? as finalists for the ?50,000 prize. 

 John Sutherland, chair of the judges, said of the selection: It did get very tight.

 But he made no secret of his own dismay, telling reporters: If I had my way, I would give Salman Rushdie the Nobel Prize. But I am not king of the world here.

 The Booker, which guarantees the winner instant literary acclaim and a place in bestseller lists around the world, rewards the best novel of the last 12 months from Britain, Ireland and the Commonwealth.

 Bookmakers had no doubt Barnes was the 2005 frontrunner for his novel Arthur and George, about a writer and a lawyer who live worlds apart in late 19th century Britain.

 Barnes is 5-4 favourite. He certainly is the leading choice of our literary punters but the big surprise was the omission of the three previous Booker winners, said Graham Sharpe, spokesman for bookmaker William Hill.

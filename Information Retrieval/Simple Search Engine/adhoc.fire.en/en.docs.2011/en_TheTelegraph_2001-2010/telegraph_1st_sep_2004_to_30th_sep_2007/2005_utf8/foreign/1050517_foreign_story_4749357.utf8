 France strike over holiday

 Paris, May 16 (Reuters): A strike hit public transport and disrupted classrooms in some parts of France today as staff defied a government decision to scrap the Pentecost public holiday to generate funds for healthcare for the elderly.

 Millions were expected to stay at home or strike over what they call a day of free work, embarrassing President Jacques Chirac two weeks before a referendum on a new EU constitution.

 You cannot think that we can give up a days holiday just like that, said Bernard Thibault, leader of the large CGT union which has urged workers to make the governments planned Day of Solidarity a day of chaos.

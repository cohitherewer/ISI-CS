 Women to blame for rape: Poll

 London, Nov. 21 (Reuters): One in three Britons believes a woman who flirts is partly or totally responsible if she is raped, a shocking opinion poll showed today.

 Between a third and a quarter of respondents also put part or all of the blame on the woman if she fails to say no clearly to the man, wears sexy clothes, drinks too much, has many sexual partners and walks alone in a deserted area.

 It is shocking that so many people will lay the blame for being raped at the feet of women themselves, said Kate Allen, a spokeswoman for Amnesty International UK which commissioned the research.

 Only four per cent of those asked thought the number of women raped exceeded 10,000 per year when there were 12,867 female rape victims in England and Wales in 2004-05 financial year, according to the home office.

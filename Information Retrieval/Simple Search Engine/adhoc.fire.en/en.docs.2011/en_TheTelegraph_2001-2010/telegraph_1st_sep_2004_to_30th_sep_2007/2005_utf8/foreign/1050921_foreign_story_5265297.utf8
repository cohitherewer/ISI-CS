 Im doing well, ready to date: Aniston

 Aniston: Media angst

 New York, Sept. 20 (AP): Jennifer Aniston says shes doing well and ready to date during an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show yesterday.

 In one of her first TV interviews since filing for divorce from Brad Pitt earlier this year, Aniston said: Im doing so well.

 Its the media that wont move on, she said. You just want to say: Come on, people! Turn a page!

 When Winfrey asked Aniston if she was ready to start the whole dating thing again, the 36-year-old actor emphatically replied: Yes ? checking her watch as if to say it was time.

 Pitt has been romantically linked with Angelina Jolie, his co-star in the Mr. amp; Mrs. Smith film. Aniston said shes now in a good place: Im not sitting somewhere dwelling on the past. Im not fretting or obsessing about something in the future.

 She was clearly more at ease than during a recent Vanity Fair magazine interview in which she was emotional, but resilient. She said then she was trying to pick up the pieces in the midst of this media circus.

 Aniston joked that if I had a dollar for every (self-help) book that was sent my way, I could have probably paid for this studio, referring to the new set of Winfreys show.

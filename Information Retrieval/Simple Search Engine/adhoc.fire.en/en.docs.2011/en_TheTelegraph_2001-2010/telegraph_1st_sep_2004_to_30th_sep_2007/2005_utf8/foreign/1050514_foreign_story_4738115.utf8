 Pak demand

 Islamabad, May 13: Hundreds 

 of religious activists took to the streets throughout Pakistan 

 today to demand an unconditional apology from the US for 

 the alleged desecration of the Quran at Guantanamo Bay, 

 while the national legislature adopted a joint resolution 

 against the act. 

 Activists of various religio-political parties held protest rallies in Islamabad, Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, and Quetta after the weekly Friday congregations and called on the government to sever diplomatic relations with the US and expel its ambassador.

 China water trouble 

 Beijing, Nov. 27 (Reuters): Chinas northeastern city of Harbin turned on the taps again today after a toxic spill into its river left millions without water for five days and an 80-km slick flowing beyond the city. 

 Water supplies in Harbin were resumed this morning and governor Zhang Zuoji drank tap water to prove it was safe, state media said. 

 Kuwait party 

 Kuwait (Reuters): Kuwaits Parliament Speaker said in remarks published today that the Gulf Arab state needed to legalise political parties in the future but the time was not yet right. It needs more time especially since elections in Kuwait are still conducted based on personal ties between candidates and voters and based on sectarian, tribal or family considerations, said Speaker Jassem al-Kharafi. 

 Egypt House 

 Cairo (Reuters): The Muslim Brotherhood has built its strength in Egypts Parliament, winning 29 seats, official results showed on Sunday. The Islamist group has now won 76 seats. The banned party is contesting only a third of the seats, not posing a threat to control over Parliament by the ruling National Democratic Party.

 Bachelor girls happy with no Valentine

 London, Feb. 14: There may be no flowers, no card, not even the ?bleep, bleep? of a romantic incoming text message, but who cares? Many single women no longer dread being alone on Valentine?s Day, according to new research.

 Contrary to the image portrayed by American television imports such as Sex and the City, single women are not tortured souls desperately searching for love. Many are ?just fine, thank you very much? and considerably happier than single men.

 Almost 56 per cent are ?very happy with their lives?, compared with 46 per cent of men, says the report today by Mintel, the consumer analysts. They also cope better on their own than men; as many as one in four single men between the ages of 25 and 40 still lives at home with his parents.

 ?Many men seem to remain dependent on their parents well into their twenties and beyond, extending their period of adolescence,? said Jenny Catlin, of Mintel. Men see ?not having enough sex? as the main disadvantage of not living with a partner, while nearly a quarter miss the comfort and closeness of being given a hug. But there are benefits to living with mother, they say, in the form of clean clothes, regular hot meals and someone to do the housework. 

 For women, other worries are more practical than men?s. Forget sex: women say they are more concerned about money (34 per cent) and their children?s day-to-day needs (31 per cent).

 Washington (Reuters): Shared moral values are less important than compatible personalities as a recipe for a good marriage, according to a study released on Sunday. Married couples often share the same attitudes about faith and other values, researchers from the University of Iowa found. But how married people behave was shown to have a greater effect on happiness. ?Being in a committed relationship entails regular interaction and requires extensive co-ordination in dealing with tasks, issues and problems of daily living,? the study found. Differences in how to deal with everyday matters can lead to ?more friction and conflict,? it said.

 Singapore (Reuters): As Valentine?s Day stoked the embers of romance worldwide, a group of Singaporeans began a campaign urging couples to curb their ardour and abstain from sex. A Christian group launched on Monday a week-long Abstinence Awareness Campaign on the island, which has one of Asia?s lowest birth rates and has ranked for three straight years near the bottom of condom-maker Durex?s survey of sexually active nations. Nearly 200 volunteers from the Christian ?Focus on The Family? group fanned out across the city-state, selling wristbands bearing the message: ?Worth Waiting For? and collecting pledges from teenagers to stay chaste until marriage.

 Seoul (AFP): Chocolates are a popular gift on Valentine?s Day but South Koreans prefer a kiss from their sweethearts, an opinion poll said on Monday. An on-line poll carried by MSN Korea said 36 per cent of respondents would rather have a kiss than candies. Around 20 per cent said they would like chocolates while 10 per cent preferred more durable goods such as clothing or electronic gadgets. Slightly more ? 22 per cent ? said they were not interested in Valentine?s Day and were not planning on receiving or giving any gifts at all. Shops reported a brisk trade in candies, however, and on-line shopping malls said the hot items were sweets, perfume, clothes and ?books for couples to read?. Interpark, a leading South Korean Internet shopping mall, was offering pillows in comforting human shapes, ?on whose arms you may rest your head to fall asleep?. 

 London (Reuters): Tech-savvy singletons take heart ? research shows looking for love in cyberspace is one of the most successful ways to find a partner. Nearly all would-be Romeos and Juliets who used dating websites found someone to hook up with, says Jeff Gavin, an expert on cyber dating who has conducted a poll into finding partners online. ?Ninety-four per cent of those surveyed saw their ?e-partner? again after first meeting them, and the relationships lasted for seven months? he said. For 18 per cent, the pairing lasted over a year or longer.

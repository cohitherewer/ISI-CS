 UK ex-envoy spills beans

 Blair: Seduced

 London, Nov. 7 (Reuters): Prime Minister Tony Blair was seduced by the glamour of US power in the build-up to the Iraq war and repeatedly failed to influence US policy, a former top British diplomat said in comments published today.

 Christopher Meyer, a former British ambassador in Washington who was heavily involved in the pre-war planning, said Blair was reluctant to negotiate conditions with President George W. Bush over Britains support for war.

 Blair did not use his position as Washingtons most important ally to delay the start of the war to give more time to plan for what to do after the fall of Saddam Hussein, Meyer said.

 Britain should have made its participation in any war dependent on a fully worked-out plan, agreed by both sides, for the rehabilitation of Iraq after Saddams demise, Meyer wrote in memoirs serialised in two British newspapers today.

 We may have been the junior partner in the enterprise, but the ace up our sleeve was that America did not want to go it alone.

 Meyer, ambassador in Washington from 1997 to February 2003 but now retired from the diplomatic service, said Britains failure to press for more planning was still being felt. He said in the Guardian and the Daily Mail that delaying the invasion from spring 2003 to the autumn would have given more time for planning for the aftermath and might have made it possible to agree on a second UN resolution.

 Malaria cases rise globally

 London, March 9 (Reuters): More than half-a-billion people, nearly double previous estimates, were affected by the deadliest form of malaria in 2002, scientists said today.

 Most were in sub-Saharan Africa but nearly 25 per cent occurred in southeast Asia and the western Pacific.

 ?The disease burden is 515 million clinical attacks a year on the planet. That is quite substantial,? said Professor Bob Snow of the Kenyan Medical Research Institute in Nairobi, Kenya.

 ?We have taken a conservative approach to estimating how many attacks occur globally each year but even so the problem is far bigger than we previously thought,? he said.

 The figures are almost twice those of the WHO which estimated the global incidence of malaria at 273 million cases in 1998.

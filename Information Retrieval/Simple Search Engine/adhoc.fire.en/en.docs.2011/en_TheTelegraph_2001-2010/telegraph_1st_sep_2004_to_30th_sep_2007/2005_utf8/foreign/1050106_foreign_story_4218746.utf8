 Mystery over fate of Swede boy

 Khao Lak (Thailand), Jan. 5 (Reuters): A case of mistaken identity has heaped mystery on the disappearance of a 12-year-old Swedish boy in Asia?s tsunami, police said today.

 The fate of Kristian Walker had triggered a police investigation and worldwide media speculation that the boy might have been kidnapped from a Thai hospital.

 But police said the reports of Kristian being in hospital had turned out to be a case of mistaken identity caused by a Thai doctor who could not tell two European children apart.

 ?There is no evidence that Kristian Walker has been kidnapped, but we are still looking for him,? sub-inspector Stephen Katay said.

 The boy was staying at the Ayara Villas hotel on Khao Lak beach, just north of the resort island of Phuket, with his mother, brother and sister when the killer waves roared up the gently sloping beach and crumpled hotels lining it.

 The brother and sister survived the tragedy, but the mother and Kristian were reported missing. A Thai doctor later told Kristian?s grandfather that he was convinced he had treated Kristian after the disaster.

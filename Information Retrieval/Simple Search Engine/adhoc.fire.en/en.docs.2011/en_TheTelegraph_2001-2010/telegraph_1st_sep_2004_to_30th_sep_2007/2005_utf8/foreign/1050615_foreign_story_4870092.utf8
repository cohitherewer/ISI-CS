 Nepal rebels kill baby

 J. HEMANTH

 Kathmandu, June 14: Suspected Maoists have killed six relatives, including an infant, of security personnel in Nepal, opening another ruthless flank in the guerrilla war on the monarchy. Three of the victims have been identified as the wives of Armed Police Force (APF) personnel. A one-year-old baby is also among those killed.

 The APF is entrusted with anti-insurgency operations.

 The six were abducted last night in western Nepal and their bodies were found in a forest today. 

 The news of the carnage coincided with an announcement by the Royal Nepalese Army (RNA) that it has not received any form of military aid from India after suspension of the assistance in the wake of the royal coup in February.

 Army spokesman Brigadier General Dipak Gurung said the RNA had not received any military supplies from India over the last four months. He was responding to questions on reports that suggested India has decided to resume military supplies that were already in the pipeline. 

 Gurung said the RNA had recently received non-lethal military assistance from the US. The US government was also helping in providing human rights training to the RNA officials. 

 Gurung said that the RNA would initiate action against commanders under whose orders soldiers have been found to travel in public vehicles with arms. The announcement came in the wake of two Maoist attacks on passenger buses. As many as 39 people died in one of the incidents.

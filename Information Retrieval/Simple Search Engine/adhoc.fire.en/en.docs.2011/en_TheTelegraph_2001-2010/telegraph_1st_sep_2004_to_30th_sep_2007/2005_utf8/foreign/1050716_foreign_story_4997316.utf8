 US forces in Pak border clash

 Major-General Shaukat Sultan

 Miranshah (Pakistan), July 15 (Reuters): US-led forces killed 24 suspected Islamist militants on the Pakistan side of the Afghan border, Pakistans military spokesman said today.

 The fighters, believed to belong to pro-Taliban and al Qaida forces, were killed crossing into Pakistan late yesterday near Lowara Mandi, a border village in the North Waziristan tribal region, Major-General Shaukat Sultan said.

 Apparently these people were trying to escape into Pakistani territory when they were hit by coalition forces. Their bodies are, of course, with the Pakistani authorities, Sultan said.

 They are foreigners and suspected Taliban. They could be Afghans and people of central Asian origin, he added.

 Paramilitary sources in North Waziristan said the militants had fired missiles at a base for US-led and Afghan forces some 3 km across the border.

 The coalition forces returned fire using rockets and heavy weapons, a paramilitary official said. A witness said he saw US helicopters engaged in the attack, while Geo television said the fighters were killed by a missile.

 Sultan said the US side had informed their Pakistani counterparts before opening fire on the fleeing militants, but there would still be a check to see whether there had been any violation of Pakistani territory or airspace.

 Pakistan has bridled in the past at US forces sorties across the border in the area around Lowara Mandi.

 A US military spokesman in Afghanistan said he had no information about the incident.

 The incident came a day after a senior US administration official said the US, Afghanistan and Pakistan needed to squeeze insurgents along the rugged border where al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden might be hiding.

 The Pakistanis need to put pressure on their side of the border at the same time we and the Afghans are putting pressure on the Afghan side of the border and hopefully you catch some bad guys in the middle, said the official, who briefed a small group of reporters on condition of anonymity in Washington.

 Tension has been building for months in North Waziristan since the Pakistan army completed a series of offensives to dislodge al Qaida bases in neighbouring South Waziristan. Yesterday, a Pakistani general warned tribes in North Waziristan of an imminent offensive to flush out foreign militants, including al Qaida fighters.

 At a meeting with tribal elders, Major-General Akram Sahi, commander of Pakistani troops in North Waziristan, gave the tribesmen 24 hours to hand over suspected militants.

 Lieutenant General David Barno, head of the US-led forces in Afghanistan, said last April that Pakistan was planning a big offensive in North Waziristan. His comments prompted irritated retorts from Pakistans military.

 Pakistan risked the wrath of the volatile Pashtun tribes when it first sent the army into their homelands in late 2003 to hunt suspected al Qaida and Taliban militants.

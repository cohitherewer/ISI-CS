 Russia no-trust vote planned

 Moscow, Feb. 7 (Reuters): Russia?s pro-Kremlin parliament today scheduled its first no-confidence vote in the government of Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov.

 It is certain to fail but analysts said it showed President Vladimir Putin?s vice-like grip on power loosening in the face of a public outcry over a law replacing Soviet-era benefits with cash allowances. About 100 mainly Opposition legislators in the 450-seat parliament are likely to vote no confidence, with the pro-Kremlin United Russia party, which controls over 300 seats, expected to vote against or abstain.

 But the fact supporters of the motion gathered the 90 signatures ? including several dozen defectors from the pro-Kremlin camp ? to have the vote in the usually docile parliament was seen as significant. ?It is a reflection of the mood in society that deputies cannot ignore and it is a serious alarm bell to the government that people are not happy,? said analyst Yevgeny Volk.

 Rooney faces granny sex trial

 Rooney: Young and stupid

 London, Aug. 17: England 

 footballer Wayne Rooney could be the star witness in a libel 

 trial after a grandmother accused of sleeping with him for 

 cash launched legal action against The Sun newspaper.

 The newspaper claimed in August last year that Patricia Tierney, a 50-year-old grandmother of 16, had sex with Rooney at a Liverpool massage parlour.

 But Tierney, of Whiston, Merseyside, claims she only worked at the parlour for three weeks as a part-time receptionist, and has never worked as a prostitute.

 Rooney admitted sleeping with prostitutes after an article was printed in the Sunday Mirror. He released a statement saying he had been young and stupid.

 Tierneys solicitor, David Kirwan, said the allegations had destroyed his blameless clients life and caused her grandchildren to be bullied. He said his client had been devastated by the allegations, which had left her on anti-depressants and forced her to dye her hair to avoid being recognised.

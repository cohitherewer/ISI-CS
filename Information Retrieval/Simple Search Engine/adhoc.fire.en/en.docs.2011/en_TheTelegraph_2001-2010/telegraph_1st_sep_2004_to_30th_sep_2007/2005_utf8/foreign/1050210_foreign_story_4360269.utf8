 Khatami firm on nuke future

 Mohammad Khatami

 Tehran, Feb. 9 (Reuters): No Iranian government, present or future, will give up the country?s drive to master peaceful nuclear technology, including uranium enrichment, President Mohammad Khatami said today.

 In a toughly worded speech to foreign ambassadors in Tehran, Khatami also warned Iran could adopt ?a new policy? which would have ?massive consequences? if Iran?s nuclear talks with the EU did not prosper.

 ?We give our guarantee that we will not produce nuclear weapons because we?re against them and do not believe they are a source of power. But we will not give up peaceful nuclear technology,? Khatami said. ?Neither my government nor any other government could be accountable to the nation for compromising over halting this technology,? he added.

 Iran denies US accusations that it is developing nuclear arms under cover of a civilian atomic energy programme.

 But Khatami, echoing tough comments by other Iranian officials in recent days, said Iran would never halt enrichment ? which can be used to make weapons-grade fuel ? and indicated Iran?s patience with the EU talks was wearing thin.

 ?We consider enrichment our clear right and will never give it up. We suspended it voluntarily to show our goodwill,? he said.

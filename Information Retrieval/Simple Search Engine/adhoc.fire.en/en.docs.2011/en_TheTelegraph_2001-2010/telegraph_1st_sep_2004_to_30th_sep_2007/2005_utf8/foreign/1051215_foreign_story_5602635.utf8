 Scientist turns back on cloning pioneer

 Schatten: Doubtful

 Washington, Dec. 14 (Reuters): A US stem cell expert who lent his name and credibility to South Korean cloning pioneers asked that his name be removed from their landmark scientific paper on Tuesday and questioned whether the work had been falsified.

 Dr Gerald Schatten of the University of Pittsburgh asked the journal Science to take his name off a human cloning study published by Woo Suk Hwang and colleagues at Seoul National University in May 2005.

 Hwang and colleagues made history in 2004 when they reported they had cloned the first human embryo ? not to make a baby, but to derive embryonic stem cells for scientific and medical research.

 In May this year, they reported that they had cloned cells from people with diseases, to make batches of cells useful for studying those diseases. And in August they cloned the first dog, Snuppy.

 The accomplishments put Hwang and South Korea at the forefront of cloning and stem cell research at a time when US politics and a debate over the ethics of cloning humans are limiting efforts.

 My careful re-evaluations of published figures and tables, along with new problematic information, now casts substantial doubts about the papers accuracy, Schatten said in a letter to Science.

 Biblical oil guide

 Kibbutz Maanit (Israel), April 4 (Reuters): A Texas oilman is using his Bible as a guide to finding oil in the Holy Land.

 Brown, a born-again Christian and founder of Zion Oil amp; Gas of Dallas, can quote chapter and verse about his latest drilling venture in Israel, where his company has an oil and gas exploration licence covering 96,000 acres. 

 ?Most blessed of sons be Asher. Let him be favoured by his brothers and let him dip his foot in oil,? Brown quotes from Moses?s blessing to one of the 12 tribes of Israel in Deuteronomy 33:24.

 Standing next to a 54-metre-high derrick at Kibbutz Maanit in northern Israel, Brown said the passage indicated there is oil lying beneath the biblical territory of the tribe of Asher, where the agricultural community is located.

 Weight woe

 Stockholm (Reuters): Swedish jail inmates 

 went on strike on Monday after authorities cut down on weight-lifting 

 and exercise sessions to stop prisoners becoming too muscle-bound. 

 The prisoners, whose protest sparked no violence, were locked 

 in their cells after refusing to attend any workshops or 

 study sessions. ?We want to offer them other ways to keep 

 fit and to take away some of the heavy weights,? Swedish 

 jail system security chief Christer Isaksson said. ?We don?t 

 feel it is part of the mission that society has given us 

 to create ... over-sized muscle builders.?

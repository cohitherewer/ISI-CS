 Global heat on Syria as Assad visits Riyadh

 Riyadh, March 3 (Reuters): Syrian President Bashar al-Assad held crisis talks today with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah amid resounding international calls on Damascus to quickly end its military presence in Lebanon.

 Diplomats said Assad, accompanied by Syrian foreign minister Farouq al-Shara, held a closed-door meeting with Prince Abdullah in Riyadh in the presence of foreign minister Saud al-Faisal.

 German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder joined the international chorus by calling on Syria to leave Lebanon ?immediately?.

 ?Syria must pull out of Lebanon immediately,? Schroeder said late yesterday during a visit to Sanaa.

 Schroeder added that Lebanon should be given a chance for sovereignty and its own development. He said that could only be achieved through compliance with Security Council resolutions stipulating immediate Syrian withdrawal.

 Arab heavyweights Saudi Arabia and Egypt have stepped up mediation efforts with Assad to pull out his 14,000 troops from Lebanon in compliance with UN resolution 1559 following the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri.

 Lebanese Opposition groups have blamed Syria for Hariri?s death and have been holding protests to pressure Damascus to withdraw its troops and intelligence forces from Lebanon.

 The chancellor?s comments came in a meeting with Yemen?s President Ali Abdullah Saleh yesterday during a visit to Sanaa as part of a regional tour.

 Arab diplomats said the Arab mediation efforts focused on securing Syria?s consent to set a timetable to withdraw its troops from Lebanon.

 Analysts said Assad was reaching out to friendly Arab states allied with the US to find a way out of the crisis.

 ?Syria is under intense pressure from all sides at the moment. Assad hopes to get backing from his ally Saudi Arabia at this difficult time,? said Saudi commentator Mohammad al-Harfy.

 Assad met Qatar?s Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani yesterday to discuss US pressure on Damascus. 

 Assad told Time that he expected to remove his troops from Lebanon in a few months but Washington said it was sceptical of Assad?s pledge.

 Thousands of demonstrators, blaming Syria for Hariri?s death, have turned out in Beirut to call for the troop withdrawal. Lebanon?s pro-Damascus government resigned on Monday, but Syria denies it was involved in the killing.

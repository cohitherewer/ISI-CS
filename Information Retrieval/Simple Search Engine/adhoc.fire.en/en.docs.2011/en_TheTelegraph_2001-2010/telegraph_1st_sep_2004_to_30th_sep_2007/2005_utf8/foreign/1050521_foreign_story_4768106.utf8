 Nuts on numbers

 Singapore, May 20 (Reuters): A record number of Singaporean couples tied the knot today because they believe the date, 20-05-2005, signifies togetherness and prosperity.

 According to the registry of marriages, 116 couples were married, the record number so far this year, the Straits Times newspaper reported.

 We are both Teochew, and in Teochew, zero sounds like circle, which symbolises completeness, 27-year-old bride-to-be Evyon Tan was quoted as saying.

 Also, five sounds like to have, and we hope to be happy and prosperous when we begin our married life, she said.

 Teochew, which originated in the Guangdong province of China, is one of the dialects spoken in Singapore. 

 Lost Lake

 Moscow (Reuters): A Russian village was left baffled on 

Thursday after its lake disappeared overnight. NTV television showed pictures 

of a giant muddy hole bathed in summer sun, while fishermen from the village of 

Bolotnikovo looked on disconsolately. Officials in Nizhegorodskaya region, on 

the Volga river east of Moscow, said water in the lake might have been sucked 

down into an underground cave system.

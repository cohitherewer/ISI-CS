 Jurors: Too much doubt

 PAUL FARHI

 Santa Maria (California), June 14: In the end, the jurors said, it came down to four words: Beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution in Michael Jacksons molestation trial just never got there for them.

 Meeting a phalanx of reporters from around the world yesterday, the 12 jurors and eight alternates spoke calmly ? and with some measure of relief ? now that they had ended Jacksons three-and-a-half-month trial with acquittal on all charges. As has been the case since they were selected in late February, they were identified not by name but by number. Male and female, old and young, they agreed that they had collectively ignored the circus-like distractions outside the jury box and made the right call.

 I think we all just looked at the evidence and just agreed, said juror number 5, a lively 79-year-old grandmother.

 Several jurors were critical of the accusers mother and appeared to have discounted her testimony as well as that of her 15-year-old son. But they stressed that they had been careful to examine every bit of evidence and follow the judges instructions to the letter. 

 Nothing mattered beyond that, they said. Not Jacksons tarnished fame. Not the intermittent parade of celebrities who testified or sat in the courtroom on Jacksons behalf. Not Jacksons high-priced defence team. Not the massive media presence encamped outside the courthouse in Santa Maria, California, nor the fan hoopla that was evident to the jurors each morning as they filed into the jury box and each afternoon as they left in the wake of Jacksons SUV-led motorcade.

 I dont want to give the impression that this was a slam-dunk deal, said juror number 1, an older man with white hair and brushy white moustache, who was identified in an interview with CNN last night as Raymond Hultman. We challenged the issues and we came to the decision that pointed to reasonable doubt. 

 The jury largely reflected the demographics of northern Santa Barbara county. It was mostly white, and comprised eight women and four men ranging in age from 20 to 79. Eight of the jurors were parents.

 Press piqued

 Bratislava (Slovakia), Feb. 25 (Reuters): Incensed by US talk of a lack of press freedom in Russia, two Russian reporters tried to turn the tables on President George W. Bush during his summit news conference with Vladimir Putin yesterday.

 After Bush said he had raised concerns about Russia?s democracy in talks with the Russian President and felt reassured, he suddenly found himself on the defensive. ?What is that lack of freedom all about?? a reporter from the Russian news agency Interfax asked the US President. Before Bush could answer, the reporter then turned on Putin and demanded to know why he was not sticking up for Russian reporters.

 A startled Bush then replied that Putin had brought up the subject of journalists getting fired recently in the US. ?People do get fired in the American press. They don?t get fired by the government, however, they get fired by their editors,? Bush said. An equally agitated Putin rejected the notion he was keeping silent on the issue. ?What do you mean when you say I keep silent? I am not the propaganda minister,? Putin said.

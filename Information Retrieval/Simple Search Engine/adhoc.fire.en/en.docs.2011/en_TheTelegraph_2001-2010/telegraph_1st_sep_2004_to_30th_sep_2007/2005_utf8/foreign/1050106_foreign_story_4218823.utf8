 30 rebels killed in Nepal clash

 Kathmandu, Jan. 5 (Reuters): The Nepali army killed at least 30 Maoist rebels today in the biggest gunbattle between guerrillas and soldiers for six weeks, an army officer said.

 Dozens of soldiers raided a rebel hideout in the Maoist stronghold of Kailali in Nepal after the army received information that hundreds of rebels had gathered in the hills. Six soldiers were wounded in the three-hour gunbattle with the rebels.

 ?We have recovered 30 bodies of Maoist rebels after a three-hour battle that erupted after an attack on a rebel concentration,? the army officer said. Another officer said a large number of Maoists were killed in the clash and hundreds wounded.

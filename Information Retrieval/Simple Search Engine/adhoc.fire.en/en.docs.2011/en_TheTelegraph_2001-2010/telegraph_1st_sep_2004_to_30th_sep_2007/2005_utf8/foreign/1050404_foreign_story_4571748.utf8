 Vatican City, April 3 (Reuters): Pope John Paul?s own words rang out across St Peter?s Square a day after he died as thousands of tearful worshippers from around the world gathered for a Requiem Mass today.

 Some gasped and held their hands to their mouths as an archbishop started to read an address the Pope had prepared for the regular Sunday mass, focusing on the hope Christians place in Jesus? own death and resurrection.

 ?To all humanity, which today seems so lost and dominated by the power of evil, selfishness and fear, our resurrected Lord gives us his love which forgives, reconciles and reopens the soul to hope,? his message read.

 Hundreds of faithful camped out in St Peter?s Square after they heard the 84-year-old Pope had died last night.

 As they stood listening to the mournful singing of the mass for the dead, couples hugged each other, wiping away tears. Italian politicians stood quietly in the front row. Behind them, faithful held up pictures of the Pontiff and the Virgin Mary or waved Polish flags for the nation?s famous son.

 ?I saw him ... he died with the serenity of the saints,? said Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican?s secretary of state who presided at the Requiem Mass. 

 In the homily he prepared for the mass, Sodano called the Pope ?John Paul II, or rather John Paul the Great,? joining other churchmen who have suggested the title be awarded to the Polish Pope, who broke numerous records in his 26-year reign.

 When he actually read his sermon, Sodano did not use the phrase. However, the Vatican considers the texts it hands out as the official record.

 The only other popes to be called ?the Great? were Pope Leo I (440-461), who warded off an attack on Rome by Attila and the Huns, and Pope Gregory I (590-604), who fought off the Lombards and opened the Vatican food stores to Rome?s ill and hungry.

 Pope John Paul has been credited with helping to bring an end to communism in Europe and preaching against dictatorships. Opponents of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 applauded his stand against the war.

 His orthodox doctrines and refusal to change long-standing Vatican opposition to contraception, abortion, married priests and women clergy have caused controversy both inside and outside the Church.

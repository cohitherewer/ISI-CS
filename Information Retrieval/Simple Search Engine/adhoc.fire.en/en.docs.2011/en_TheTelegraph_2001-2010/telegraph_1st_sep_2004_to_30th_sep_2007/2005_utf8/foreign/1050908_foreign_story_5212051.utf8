 Unveiled: New Apple phone thats also an iPod

 New York, Sept. 7 (Reuters): Apple Computer Inc. today unveiled a cellphone that works like an iPod music player, in a bid to extend its domination of the digital music market.

 The colour screen, silver device, which was developed with Motorola Inc., can store 100 songs and has stereo speakers, stereo headphones and a camera.

 Cingular Wireless, a venture of SBC Communications Inc. and BellSouth Corp., will be the exclusive US carrier of the phone, Apples chief executive Steve Jobs said.

 The item will be in stores beginning this weekend under the ROKR band name, the latest in the family of phones inspired by Motorolas hugely popular Razr phone design.

 Music is expected to be one of the hottest new features in mobile phones, which already sport everything from cameras to video players.

 Apple, which keeps new products under tight wraps before unveiling them at carefully staged events, fanned speculation last week the company was preparing to introduce several long anticipated new music player products.

 Apple has sold more than 21 million iPods since introducing the iPod in 2001.

 Jobs also said that Apple would introduce a new iPod digital music player called the Nano, which would hold up to 1,000 songs and be thinner than a pencil.

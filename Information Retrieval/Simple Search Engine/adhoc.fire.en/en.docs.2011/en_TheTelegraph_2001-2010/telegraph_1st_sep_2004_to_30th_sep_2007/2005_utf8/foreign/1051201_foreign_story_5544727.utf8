 Brussels, Nov. 30: A Belgian-born convert to Islam has become the first European woman suicide bomber, killing herself recently in Iraq, French intelligence officials have claimed.

 The reports are being taken seriously, Belgian sources said last night. If the woman, whose identity has not been released, is confirmed as a suicide bomber, she would be the first European female known to have taken part in such an attack.

 Unconfirmed reports on RTL France radio, said that the womans Belgian nationality had been established by her home countrys security service, the S?ret? de ?tat.

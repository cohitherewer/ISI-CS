 Day of orgasm

 Rio de Janeiro, May 10 (AP): Sex rarely makes the news in Brazils conservative northeast ? until a small town has declared an official orgasm day.

 Espertantina mayor Felipe Santolia endorsed the holiday yesterday, which he said was intended to improve relationships between married couples.

 ?Were celebrating orgasm in all its senses. Theres even a panel discussion on premature ejaculation. But from what Ive seen, women have more trouble achieving orgasm than men, especially in marriage,? Santolia said by telephone from Esperantina, 2,100 km north of Rio de Janeiro.

 The city council passed a law on Saturday creating the holiday. ?Im 32, single and I have an open mind. Besides, the theme is very much of the moment,? he said.

 Super soup

 London (AFP): The most expensive soup in Britain is the 

star dish on the menu of an upmarket Chinese restaurant in London ? at a mere 

?108 a bowl. Called ?Buddha Jumps Over the Wall?, the sharks fin soup ? 

which must be ordered five days in advance ? is made with whole abalone, Japanese 

flower mushroom, sea cucumber, dried scallops, chicken, hunan ham, pork and ginseng.

 Tiger chief report

 Colombo, Jan. 9 (AFP): The Sri Lankan Broadcasting Corporation has retracted its report that Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and his intelligence chief Pottu Amman are among the dead or missing in the tsunami disaster, an official with the broadcaster said today.

 The state broadcaster yesterday ran reports on its English and Tamil language services that the two men had not been seen since the tsunami struck the island on December 26. It offered no reason for today?s retraction of the report.

 The LTTE slammed the broadcaster for carrying the reports, saying now was ?not the time for gossip mongering and malicious propaganda?.

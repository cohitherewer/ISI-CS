 Charles wants sons to atone: Report

 Prince Harry

 London, Jan. 14 (Reuters): Britain?s Prince William has been ordered to join his tearaway younger brother Harry on a private visit to Auschwitz, a newspaper reported today, as a scandal over Nazi regalia engulfed the two young royals.

 Harry, 20, provoked outrage this week when photos of him wearing a swastika at a costume party appeared in the Sun newspaper.

 But William, 22, second in line to the throne, was at the same party and even, according to the paper, went along to help his brother choose the Nazi outfit.

 Now their father, Prince Charles, wants the pair to make a private visit to the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz in Poland to atone for the mistake, according to the Sun. 

 A spokesperson for Charles declined to comment. But royal sources refused to rule out the possibility of a trip, saying only that the pair would not join a British delegation at January 27 events to commemorate 60 years since the liberation of Auschwitz.

 The Sun reported the princes would visit the camp in the near future with a Jewish charity.

 The royal sources said while no such visit was being planned at present, any trip to Auschwitz would be private.

 The Board of Deputies of British Jews said it had not been contacted by the royal family, but welcomed the prospect of a visit. ?In light of this event we?d welcome Prince Harry to show he is prepared to embrace education about the Holocaust,? a spokesperson said.

 The Nazis murdered six million Jews and millions of others including Poles, homosexuals, Soviet prisoners and Gypsies. Millions more were imprisoned or forced to work as slaves.

 Harry, younger son of Charles and the late Princess Diana, said in a statement he was sorry if he had caused any offence over his ?poor choice? of costume, but politicians have called for him to make a public apology. 

 Both princes were roasted by Charles but royal sources said their father thinks Harry?s written apology was sufficient.

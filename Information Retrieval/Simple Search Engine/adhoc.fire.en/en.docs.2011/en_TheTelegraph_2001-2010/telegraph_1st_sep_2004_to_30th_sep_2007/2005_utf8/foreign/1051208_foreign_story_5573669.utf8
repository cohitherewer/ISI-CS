 Ministry shake-up in Nepal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kathmandu, Dec. 7: Nepals King Gyanendra today conducted a major reshuffle of his ministers and expanded the cabinet in the second such change since he assumed absolute power earlier this year.

 There will be 14 cabinet ministers, seven state ministers and 14 assistant ministers in the new cabinet.

 The Rastriya Prajatantra Party leader Kamal Thapa took over as the new home minister after the incumbent Dan Bahadur Shahi was sacked.

 Former Prime Minister Kesar Bahadur, who served during the Panchayat regime, was inducted as the agriculture minister. Former minister Narayan Singh Pun was sworn in as the land reform minister.

 Gyanendra retained Tulsi Giri and Kirthi Nidhi Bista as vice-chairmen of his council of ministers. However, he sacked finance minister Madhukar Shamsher Rana for failing to rescue the economy during his 11-month tenure. 

 Gyanendras reshuffle comes less than a week after he returned from a trip to Africa.

 Home minister Shahis departure comes four days after an incident in Naya Baneshwor near Kathmandu when crown Prince Parass motorcade, which was on its way to the airport, was stoned. 

 The reshuffle comes at a time when the Maoists and the Opposition political parties are moving closer to isolate Gyanendra.

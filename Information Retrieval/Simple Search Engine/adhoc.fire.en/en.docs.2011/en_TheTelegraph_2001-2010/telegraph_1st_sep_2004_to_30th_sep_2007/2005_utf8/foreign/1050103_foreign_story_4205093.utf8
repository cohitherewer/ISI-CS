 Kuwait minister quits before ?immoral concert? quiz

 Kuwait, Jan. 2 (Reuters): Kuwait?s information minister resigned today, one day before he was due to be questioned in parliament mainly over allowing ?immoral? western-style concerts in the Muslim country.

 Mohammad Abulhasan handed in his resignation to Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, the state news agency KUNA reported, but did not say whether it had been accepted. ?I handed in my resignation ... not to avoid serving my country or in fear of political questioning, but to protect my country from political discussions, skirmishes and wrangling from which we would all lose,? KUNA quoted Abulhasan as saying.

 Sheikh Sabah said that labour minister Faisal al-Hajji would oversee the information ministry for the time being, KUNA said.

 Abulhasan, the only Shia minister in the 18-member cabinet, was due to be questioned tomorrow by some Islamist MPs over allegations including neglect of social values after he approved music concerts deemed un-Islamic by critics.

 Sheikh Sabah has warned that the questioning, demanded by Islamist Sunni MPs, could lead to sectarian rifts in the tiny oil-rich Gulf Arab state if it were mishandled.

 Shias make up one-third of the pro-western country?s native population of 950,000 and hold five seats in the 50-member parliament.

 Islamist MPs and religious figures protested last year against a concert by artists participating in a popular televised Arab talent show. They also asked unrelated men and women be segregated at concerts, as required by Islamic law.

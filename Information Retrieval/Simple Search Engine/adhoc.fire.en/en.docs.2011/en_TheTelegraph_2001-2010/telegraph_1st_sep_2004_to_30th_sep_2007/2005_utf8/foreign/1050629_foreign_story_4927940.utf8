 Firms urged to fund fight against smoking

 Washington, June 28 (Reuters): The government asked a federal judge to require cigarette makers to fund a $10 billion quit-smoking programme and $4 billion for an anti-smoking education campaign to remedy decades of alleged fraud by the industry.

 Lawyers for the justice department told US district judge Gladys Kessler in a motion with the court late yesterday that the smoking cessation programme and other remedies should be imposed if the judge rules in favour of the government in its landmark racketeering case.

 The remedies were in line with sanctions government lawyers outlined in closing arguments before Kessler earlier this month. However, the plan has drawn criticism because it is only a fraction of the $130 billion, 25-year programme recommended by a government witness.

 The $10 billion would pay for a nationwide programme that would run for five years if Kessler concludes that the tobacco companies violated racketeering laws.

 The $4 billion education programme would be spread over 10 years and run through the American Legacy Foundation, an anti-smoking campaign created as part of the cigarette makers 1998 settlement with state attorneys general. 

 Industry critics repeated long-standing charges that the penalties are too weak and that the Bush administration was catering to the tobacco industry.

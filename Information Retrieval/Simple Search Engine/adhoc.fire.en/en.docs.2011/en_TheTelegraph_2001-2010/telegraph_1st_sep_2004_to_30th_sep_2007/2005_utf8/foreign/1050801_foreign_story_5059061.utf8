 Spanish speak

 Boston, July 31 (Reuters): An umpire who ordered a Little League baseball team to stop speaking Spanish during a game this week was barred from officiating any more games this year, league officials said on Friday.

 The incident occurred when a bilingual assistant coach shouted out instructions in Spanish to the teams 14-year-old pitcher and catcher, who are immigrants from the Dominican Republic and speak little English, the Eagle-Tribune newspaper reported.

 The umpire then ordered the team to speak only English. The coach of a Methuen, Massachusetts-based Little League squad said the umpires ruling banning the use of Spanish on the field demoralised his team and ultimately contributed to its loss in a state tournament game, according to the newspaper report.

 dog went to investigate in a forest close to the German-Czech 

 border. Then they discovered this gigantic stinkhorn,

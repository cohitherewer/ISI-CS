 Straw name twist 

 Brussels, July 12 (Reuters): British foreign secretary Jack Straw, struggling to pronounce tongue-twisting surnames from fellow EU countries, came up today with a clever idea to make life easier: the one-syllable European name.

 It occurred to me that since were talking about strengthening the EU, maybe we we should have a proposal for the harmonisation of surnames, he told a bemused European Parliament committee. They should all become monosyllabic Anglo-Saxon surnames like Straw, as theyre so much easier to pronounce.

 Turning to the panels German chairman, Elmar Brok, he said: Well, Broks not bad actually, adding special praise for Finnish deputy Alexander Stubb. Good to see youve got a good English surname, Straw told him, only for Stubb to reply that his wife is British. My wifes name is Innes, and therefore she did not want to go for Stubbiness, he retorted.

 Straw stumbled repeatedly last week over the name of Greek EU lawmaker Giorgios Dimitrakopoulos in parliament last week, eventually giving up and accepting Broks advice to call him George.

 Stench catches cats

 Washington (Reuters): About 300 cats, nearly a third of 

them dead, were removed from an elderly womans Virginia home after neighbours 

complained of a stench coming from the house, police said on Tuesday. The house, 

less than 1.5 km from late President George Washingtons historic Mount Vernon 

estate, looked neat from the outside with manicured lawns and bright flowers, 

but inside it was overflowing with wild cats, feces and urine. Cats were 

coming out of the cabinets and drawers and were inside the walls, the police 

said.

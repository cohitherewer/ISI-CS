 War and peace on America lips 

 - Bush keeps Iran on toes

 President George 

 W. Bush (Reuters) 

 Washington, Jan. 18: President 

 George W. Bush has said he would not rule out military action 

 against Iran if that country was not more forthcoming about 

 its suspected nuclear weapons programme.

 ?I hope we can solve it diplomatically, 

 but I will never take any option off the table,? Bush told 

 NBC News yesterday in an interview, when asked if he would 

 rule out the potential for military action against Iran 

 ?if it continues to stonewall the international community 

 about the existence of its nuclear weapons programme.?

 Iran, which denies it has been 

 trying to make nuclear weapons and says its nuclear programme 

 is geared solely to producing electricity, today said it 

 has the military might to deter attacks against it.

 Iranian defence minister Ali Shamkhani 

 said the Islamic Republic, which has seen US forces topple 

 regimes in neighbouring Afghanistan and Iraq in the last 

 three years, did not fear attack.

 ?We are able to say that we have 

 strength such that no country can attack us because they 

 do not have precise information about our military capabilities 

 due to our ability to implement flexible strategies,? the 

 semi-official Mehr news agency quoted Shamkhani as saying. 

 ?We can claim that we have rapidly produced equipment that 

 has resulted in the greatest deterrent,? he said, without 

 elaborating.

 Chinese firms 

 The US imposed penalties this 

 month against some of China?s largest companies for aiding 

 Iran?s efforts to improve its ballistic missiles. The move 

 is part of an effort by the White House and American intelligence 

 agencies to identify and slow important elements of Iran?s 

 weapons programmes. 

 However, the White House made 

 no public announcement of the penalties and the state department 

 placed a one-page notice on page 133 of The Federal Register 

 early this month listing eight Chinese companies affected. 

 Two of the largest companies cited 

 in the list, China Great Wall Industry Corporation and China 

 North Industry Corporation, known as Norinco, have been 

 repeatedly penalised for more than a decade; each is closely 

 linked to the Chinese military.

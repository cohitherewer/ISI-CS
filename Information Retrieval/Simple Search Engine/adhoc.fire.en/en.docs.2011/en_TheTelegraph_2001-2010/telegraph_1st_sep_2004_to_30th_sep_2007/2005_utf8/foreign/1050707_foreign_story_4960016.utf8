 William in NZ 

flight drama

 Wellington, July 6: Prince William was caught up in a mid-air drama after a plane carrying him made two aborted attempts to land in poor weather.

 The Air New Zealand flight to Invercargill was diverted to Christchurch due to poor visibility and low cloud. The pilot told passengers that he wouldnt have seen the runway until we were about to hit it. A spokesman for the prince said William was completely relaxed with the aircraft and thought he was in good hands.

 Pilot Jeff Lynton told William and the other 65 people on board the twin engine ATR-72 that he had been unable to spot the runway as the plane made its approach.

 Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, sorry about that. We made two approaches. We did the best we could, he said. We wouldnt have even seen the runway until we were about to hit it. We had two goes for you.

 Second in line to the throne, William looked unperturbed as he sat at the back next to friend Thomas van Straubezee. Lynton said afterwards: I wanted to get the boy down. Hes got things to do. Ive only had this once before and Ive been flying for five years.

 China babies on Web sale

 Beijing, Oct. 20 (Reuters): Advertisements offering babies for sale appeared this week on a Chinese website owned by Internet auction house eBay, a company official said today.

 The ads were posted on the EachNet site on Sunday, promising babies under 100 days old from the impoverished central province of Henan at prices of 28,000 yuan ($3,500) for boys and 13,000 yuan for girls. The posting said it was meant to bring blessings to all families unable to have children across the country, Tang Lei, from Shanghai-based EachNets public relations department, said.

 The website, Chinas largest online auction platform, removed the posting immediately after hearing about it, by which point more than 40 people had browsed the advertisement without making any purchases. 

 The sale of children and women is a nationwide problem in China, where stringent rules on family planning allow couples to just have one child, at least in cities. The restrictions have bolstered a traditional bias for male offspring, seen as the mainstay for elderly parents, and have resulted in abortions or killings of baby girls. Child trafficking is a capital offence in China where at least four people have been executed for kidnapping and related offences this year.

 Tang said his company, which was bought out by US-based online auctioneer eBay Inc. for $180 million, was working with Shanghai police to investigate the posting. The word baby was not caught in EachNets automatic screens for illegal content because of the large number of baby products pitched on the site, he said. As a result of the incident, Tang said, the website was planning to screen every posting.

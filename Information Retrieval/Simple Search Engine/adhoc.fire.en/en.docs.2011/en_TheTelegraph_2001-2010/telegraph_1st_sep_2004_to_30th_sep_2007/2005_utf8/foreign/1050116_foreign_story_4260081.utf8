 Titan?s orange world revealed

 Los Angeles, Jan. 15 (Reuters): Data sent back by the Huygens space probe from the Saturnian moon Titan show a frozen, orange world shrouded in a methane-rich haze with dark ice rocks dotting a riverbed-like surface the consistency of wet sand, scientists said today.

 The Huygens probe, part of a $3 billion joint mission involving Nasa and the European and Italian space agencies, made its pioneering descent to Titan yesterday, sending back readings on the moon?s atmosphere, composition and landscape. 

 Slowed by parachutes, Huygens took more than two hours to float to the icy surface, where it defied expectations of a quick death and continued to transmit for at least two hours.

 Along with scientific instruments that measure the components of Titan?s atmosphere, Huygens carried a sound recorder and lamp to look for signs of surface liquid.

 One reading from an instrument protruding from the front of the saucer-shaped craft to gauge how deeply it penetrated upon impact suggested that the moons surface was the consistency of wet sand or clay.

 ?We think this is a material which may have a thin crust, followed by a region of relatively uniform consistency,? John Zarnecki, the scientist in charge of experiments on Titan?s surface said at a televised news conference from the control centre in Germany.

 Zarnecki said one of his colleagues had suggested another analogy: creme brulee. ?But I dont suppose that will be appearing in any of our papers,? he said. Creme brulee is a French term for what the English refer to as burnt cream. Titan, believed to be the only moon in the solar system with an atmosphere, is larger than the planet Mercury.

 One of the mysteries of Titan is the amount of methane that surrounds it, prompting speculation that there might be oceans of the element on its surface or below. 

 Some have also questioned whether the impact of a meteorite ? or some other event ? could have thrown off enough heat to liquefy water on Titan, where the surface is now an extreme cold measured at minus 180 degrees Celsius.

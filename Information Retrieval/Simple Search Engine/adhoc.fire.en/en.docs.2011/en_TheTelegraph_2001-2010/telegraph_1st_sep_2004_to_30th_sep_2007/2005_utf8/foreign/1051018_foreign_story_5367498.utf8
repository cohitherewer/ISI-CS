 Iran vents anger at Britain over blasts

 Tehran, Oct. 17 (Reuters): Thousands of Iranians vented their anger at Britain today at the funerals of six people killed in weekend bombings which Iran has blamed on London.

 State television showed mourners chanting: Death to Britain as they carried the coffins of those killed in Saturdays twin blasts through the streets of the southwestern city of Ahvaz, where the attacks occurred.

 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who won June elections pledging a tougher foreign policy and a crackdown on corruption, said yesterday Iran was very suspicious about the role of British forces in the bombings.

 No one has claimed responsibility for the bombings and local government officials denied reports that one suspect had been arrested and confessed to receiving training from the UK.

 Britain has condemned and denied any involvement in the blasts, which were the latest in a spate of bombings and unrest in the oil-producing Khuzestan province which borders southern Iraq and where, unusually for Iran, ethnic Arabs constitute the majority of the population.

 Relations between Tehran and London have worsened sharply in recent weeks over Britains support for US moves to refer Irans nuclear case to the UN Security Council and accusations that Iran was linked to insurgent attacks on British troops in Iraq.

 Tehran denies seeking nuclear weapons or meddling in Iraq. They might think that by doing such things we will forget about (our pursuit of) nuclear energy, an unidentified woman told state television in Ahvaz.

 The homemade bombs were left in rubbish bins outside a busy shopping mall and detonated three minutes apart, wounding almost 100 people and damaging several cars and shop fronts.

 Brigadier General Mohsen Kazemeini, Revolutionary Guards commander of south Iran, said the blasts bore the hallmarks of Ahvaz bombings in June that killed four people.

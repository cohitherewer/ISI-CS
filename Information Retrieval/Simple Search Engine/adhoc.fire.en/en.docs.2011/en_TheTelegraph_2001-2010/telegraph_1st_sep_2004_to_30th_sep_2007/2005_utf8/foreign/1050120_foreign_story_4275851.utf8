 Fine Print

 Stinging slap

 Rome, Jan. 19 (Reuters): An Italian man who slapped a young woman on the bottom while she was making a telephone call has been handed a 14-month suspended jail term by the Supreme Court.

 The tough sentence made headlines in Italy where judges have been cracking down on sexual harassment with a string of ground-breaking verdicts against unsolicited advances.

 Italy?s highest court ruled that the slap was an act of sexual aggression, which belittled the woman and caused her ?duress?. The aggressor, identified only as Ivan P., told the court that the victim was a relative, who had invented the story to get revenge in a family feud.

 Spray stop

 London (Reuters): The makers of the 

 handy spray lubricant WD-40 proudly list 2,000 uses for 

 their product, from unsticking rusty screws or squeaky bicycle 

 chains to polishing frying pans. But British police have 

 found another ? keeping the public from snorting cocaine 

 off toilet lids in bars. Police in the English city of Bristol 

 said on Tuesday they have been advising pub and nightclub 

 owners to spray the colourless lubricant on toilet seats 

 and other flat surfaces in the lavatory that customers often 

 use to snort drugs. Apparently, cocaine and spray lube don?t 

 mix.

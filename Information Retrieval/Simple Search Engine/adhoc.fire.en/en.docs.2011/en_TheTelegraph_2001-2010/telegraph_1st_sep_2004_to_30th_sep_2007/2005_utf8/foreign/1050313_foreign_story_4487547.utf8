 Horror of horrors! Swank set for Reaping

 Hilary Swank

 Los Angeles, March 12: Two-time Oscar winner Hilary Swank is in final negotiations to star in Dark Castle Entertainment?s latest horror entry, The Reaping, for Warner Bros. Pictures.

 Reaping is a supernatural tale centreing on a myth debunker (Swank) who travels to a small, religious town in Texas to investigate occurrences that appear to be the 10 biblical plagues.

 James Cox is directing the script, which is based on a script by Brian Rousso that has been rewritten by Chad and Carey Hayes. The Hayes brothers wrote the upcoming Dark Castle production House of Wax.

 Dark Castle is the horror shingle of filmmakers Joel Silver and Robert Zemeckis. Although it?s known for such genre fare as House on Haunted Hill, Thirteen Ghosts, and Ghost Ship, it also turned out a higher-end horror movie in 2003?s Gothika, starring Halle Barry. ?This is exciting for us,? Silver said of the deal with Swank. ?She is fantastic, and it?s a great opportunity to do something special with a really great actress.?

 According to Silver, A-list talent will sign on for a scary movie if the project is smart and intelligent. ?These higher-end actresses, like Halle and Gothika and Nicole (Kidman) with The Others, they look at these movies and say: ?Let?s see if we can do something great,? he said.

 Swank is readying to shoot The Black Dahlia for director Brian De Palma.

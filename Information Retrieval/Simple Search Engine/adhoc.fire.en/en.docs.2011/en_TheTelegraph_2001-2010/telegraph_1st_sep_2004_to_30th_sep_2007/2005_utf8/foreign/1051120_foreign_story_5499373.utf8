 New Lanka leader talks peace

 Colombo, Nov. 19 (Reuters): New Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse was sworn in today pledging to talk peace with the Tamil Tigers, but the rebels painted him as an enemy and said negotiating with the majority Sinhalese was impossible.

 Rajapakse won Thursdays poll with a slim margin after over half a million minority Tamil voters expected to back the more conciliatory Opposition leader Ranil Wickremesinghe stayed away after a boycott enforced by the rebels.

 In the war-shattered streets of the northern government stronghold of Jaffna some nervous residents angry at being scared away from voting feared a return to war.

 I am disappointed, 59-year-old public servant Navaratnam Kutanesan said. Even though I did not vote I expected Ranil to win. Now we have to get ready for war now Mahinda has won. His allies are all anti-Tamil. It will be a racist government.

 Rajapakse allied himself to hardline Marxists and Sinhalese nationalists who detest the Tigers, but insists he wants long-term peace.

 The government is ready to review the ceasefire agreement, Rajapakse said in Sinhalese. 

 This process can start as soon as the relevant parties are ready. Human rights violations, such as child abduction and murder, that are happening despite the ceasefire must come to an end.

 The Tigers had already warned Rajapakse against tampering with the terms of the truce, which is at its lowest ebb since the ceasefire amid sporadic attacks that culminated in the August assassination of the islands foreign minister.

 The Sinhala people and by implication the leaders they elect do not have the understanding of the basic causes of the Tamil ethnic problem, the rebels said in a strongly worded statement issued on their official website www.ltteps.org.

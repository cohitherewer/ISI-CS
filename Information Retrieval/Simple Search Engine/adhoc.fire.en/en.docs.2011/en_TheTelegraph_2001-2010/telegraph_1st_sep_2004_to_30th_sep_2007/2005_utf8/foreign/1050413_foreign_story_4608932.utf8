 Police end Germany abduction

 Ennepetal (Germany), April 12 (Reuters): German police stormed a cellar where an Iranian man was holding four schoolgirls at knifepoint today, ending a five-hour siege in a western German town.

 ?The situation has ended without trouble,? a police spokesman at the scene said.

 ?At 1612 GMT, police went in and overwhelmed the man. I cannot comment at the moment on the state of the hostages.? 

 The man, aged 50, had threatened a bus driver and snatched the children in Ennepetal, a town near the industrial Ruhr Valley, at about 1100 GMT. Six other children initially held in the bus managed to escape. The man then barricaded himself and his four hostages, aged 12 to 16, in the cellar of a nearby house. Witnesses said he was demanding his family be allowed to join him in Germany.

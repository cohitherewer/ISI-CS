 Iran blasts fan fear, fury

 Tehran, June 13 (Reuters): Iranians reacted with anger and fear today to a rare string of bomb attacks that killed nine people and wounded more than 70 ahead of presidential elections.

 Officials have blamed yesterdays attacks on exiled Opposition groups, such as the Peoples Mujahideen Organisation, and foreign agents seeking to deter Iranians from voting.

 The death toll from an evening blast in central Tehran rose to two, said Ali Aghamohammadi, Supreme National Security Council spokesperson. Two people remained on the critical list.

 Workmen in the southwestern oil city of Ahvaz were repairing water pipes, power lines and buildings damaged in four blasts outside state offices that killed seven people and wounded 70. Traffic swirled through the streets as normal, but the attacks clearly rattled many Iranians ahead of Fridays polls.

 Im not going to vote. Im afraid of another explosion. I think Friday will be a very dangerous day, said Ahmad Ali Yacoub, a 36-year-old government employee. Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, bidding to regain the presidency he held from 1989 to 1997, said the attacks were the work of ruthless opponents of the Islamic revolution. They are trying to intimidate the people because they think the people would not participate in the elections, he told state television. It is clear that this will backfire.

 Opinion polls show Rafsanjani leading in the race to replace reformist President Mohammad Khatami, who failed to overcome hardline resistance to reform during his eight years in office. 

 Sean Penns Rafsanjani interview

 Actor Sean Penn, warming to his occasional role as a reporter, has quizzed the top contender in Irans presidential elections about democracy and had a brush with security agents at an illegal womens protest.

 Penn, 44, on assignment for the San Franciso Chronicle, had already caused a stir by turning up to listen to worshippers chantDeath to America at Friday prayers in Tehran last week.

 Yesterday, he tackled Shia cleric Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former President who leads opinion polls, about US criticism of the election after hundreds of hopefuls were barred from running by a panel of religious hardliners. Rafsanjani, 70, said Iran was fielding eight candidates for President ? a larger choice than American voters had at their polls in November.

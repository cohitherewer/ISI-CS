 11 killed after attack on Pak Shia leader

 Gilgit (Pakistan), Jan. 8 (Reuters): At least 11 people were killed, six of them burnt alive, in remote northern Pakistan today in violence that erupted after an attack on a minority Shia leader, official and hospital sources said.

 The authorities imposed a curfew in Gilgit, the main town in the mountainous region known as Northern Areas, and called out the army to quell the violence after enraged Shias went on the rampage following the attack on Ziauddin Moosavi.

 Moosavi was travelling in his car to a mosque in the centre of Gilgit, some 240 km north of Islamabad, when unidentified gunmen opened fire at him, critically injuring Moosavi and his three guards. Two of the guards later died.

 One of the attackers was killed when Moosavi?s guards returned fire, Northern Areas home secretary Jamil Ahmed said. 

 ?He is not from Gilgit. We are trying to establish his identity,? he said. Ahmed said eight people were killed in the violence that followed the attack on Moosavi.

 An angry mob set fire to the house of a forest department official, burning alive the official and five others. A local health department official was also attacked and killed.

 Buzzing bees

 London, April 22 (Reuters): British police issued an alert today for a swarm of 30,000 honey bees that disappeared into thin air ? although they said they did not suspect foul play.

 ?The keeper noticed that his bees were suddenly swarming and then they all just buzzed off,? said a spokesman for West Mercia police in the English Midlands

 ?The owner reported it to us and we put out the alert ? although I must say this place has hardly been a hive of activity as a result,? he added, noting just one sighting. 

 Dog days

 Rome (Reuters): Dog owners in Turin will 

 be fined up to 500 euros ($650) if they don?t walk their 

 pets at least three times a day, under a new law from the 

 city?s council. People will also be banned from dyeing their 

 pets? fur or ?any form of animal mutilation? for merely 

 aesthetic motives such as docking dogs? tails, under the 

 law to be passed in the northern Italian city.

 Castro ill, says CIA

 Washington, Nov. 17 (Reuters): The CIA has concluded that Cuban President Fidel Castro suffers from Parkinsons disease and could have difficulty coping with the duties of office as his condition worsens, an official said today.

 The assessment, completed in recent months, suggests the non-fatal but debilitating disease has progressed far enough to warrant questions among US policymakers about the communist countrys future. But US diplomats played down the significance of any CIA assessment and said they were not using such intelligence to make decisions about Castro or Cuba.

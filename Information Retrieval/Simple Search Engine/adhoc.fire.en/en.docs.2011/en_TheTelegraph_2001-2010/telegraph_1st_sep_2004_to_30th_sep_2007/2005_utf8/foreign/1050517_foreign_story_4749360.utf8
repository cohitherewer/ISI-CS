 Deuba faces jail threat

 J. HEMANTH

 Sher Bahadur Deuba

 Kathmandu, May 16: The Royal Commission for Corruption Control, set-up by King Gyanendra, today demanded a 10-year jail term for former Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and former water resources minister Prakash Man Singh for their alleged role in a water project scam.

 The commission in its chargesheet alleged that Deuba and Singh, who is still in detention, had accepted bribes of over Rs 370 million while awarding the construction contract of the Melamchi water project. 

 The two politicians were recently arrested for refusing to respond to the commissions summons. They, instead, questioned the legality of the commission by saying that it was constituted by Gyanendra with the sole objective of launching a witch hunt against the politicians.

 The anti-graft body is expected to give its verdict tomorrow. 

 EU urges talks

 The EU welcomed the formation of an alliance by the seven major political parties and hoped that it would lead to a dialogue between the parties and Gyanendra. 

 In a statement issued here today, the EU said that its 25 member states strongly believed that the development of multiparty democracy in Nepal must be an essential part of any acceptable and sustainable resolution to the current conflict. 

 The EU urges both the king and the political parties to show flexibility in initiating this dialogue and in reviving the democratic process, the statement said. It stressed on the need to respect civil and political rights.

 Mariah return

 Los Angeles, Nov. 17 (AP): Talk about a comeback kid.

 In 2001, Mariah Carey took on Hollywood ? and Hollywood won. Her feature film-starring debut, Glitter, proved anything but gold. It was drubbed by critics and ignored by ticket buyers. What followed could have made a far better movie: Carey suffered a breakdown and within a year was bought out of her $100 million contract with Virgin Records. 

 On Tuesday night, at the Virgin Megastore, she returned to Hollywood nothing less than triumphant. Her latest CD, The Emancipation of Mimi, has sold 4 million copies in the US. Shes sold another 2 million copies worldwide.

 They can call me whatever they want, Carey, 35, said. I never went anywhere. And my real fans have always been here for me. And, you know what? Its a wonderful feeling and everything I have is because God has blessed me with this and Ill always be grateful for what I have.

 Carey ? in a low-cut, mid-thigh-length silver-sequined dress ? greeted and chatted with the fans on the street. Inside the store, she tried to make meaningful connections with those who got autographs. I love meeting fans face-to-face when I can, she said. Theres something about somebody just connecting with you musically.

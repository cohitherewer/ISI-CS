 West Side Story director dies

 Los Angeles, Sept. 15 (Reuters): Hollywood filmmaker Robert Wise, a four-time Academy Award winner who brought the beloved musicals West Side Story and The Sound of Music to the big screen during a career that spanned six decades, died yesterday, four days after turning 91.

 Wise died of heart failure at UCLA Medical Center, trade paper the Hollywood Reporter said, citing family friend and talent agency owner Lawrence Mirisch.

 Born on September 10, 1914, in Winchester, Indiana, Wise got his first Hollywood job as a messenger in the editing department of RKO Pictures. His big break came when he was hired as editor of Citizen Kane, the 1941 Orson Welles movie widely considered to be one of the greatest of all time. The project yielded the first of Wises seven Oscar nominations.

 Wise won the directing and best picture Oscars in 1962 for West Side Story, sharing the former prize with Jerome Robbins. He won the same two honours in 1966 for the box office smash The Sound of Music, based on the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical.

 Iraq MP killed

 Karbala (Iraq), June 28 (Reuters): An Iraqi MP, three of his bodyguards and his son were killed by a suicide car bomb attack on their convoy in the northern outskirts of Baghdad today, police sources said.

 Dhari Ali al-Fayadh, a member of the ruling Shia-dominated political alliance, was the second member of Iraqs newly elected parliament to be assassinated since the Shia- and Kurdish-led government took office two months ago. Al Qaidas wing in Iraq claimed responsibility for the attack, saying his crime was that he belonged to a council that legislated against what it saw as Gods commands. Violence in Iraq has worsened dramatically since the government took office. Lamia Khadori, another parliamentarian, was gunned down at her home in April.

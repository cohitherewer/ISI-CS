 Keep track of blood pressure on your wrist

Singapore, Jan. 22 (AFP): A medical firm in 

Singapore has invented a wristwatch that tracks blood pressure round the clock 

without causing pain or discomfort.

 Healthstats International said on its website that a tiny sensor on the underside of the watch rests above an artery in the wearer?s wrist and converts pulsations picked up into readable data.

 Data on blood pressure readings and patterns, mean arterial pressure, pulse patterns and heart rates can be collected, the firm said. The information gathered would provide important indicators on the wearer?s likelihood of having a stroke and help assess the risk of heart-related diseases.

 Blood pressure is currently taken by strapping an uncomfortable arm cuff onto the patient or inserting a catheter into the patient?s artery during operations. The procedure is painful and includes risks such as infections.

 In an article in the Straits Times today, the company said the watch would also make it easier for doctors to predict their patients? health risks, as 24-hour monitoring of blood pressure gives a more accurate indication of health than weekly or monthly checks.

 ?The aim is to be able to see what goes on between the times I see my patients, and to catch them before they have a stroke or heart attack,? inventor Dr Ting Choon Meng told the paper.

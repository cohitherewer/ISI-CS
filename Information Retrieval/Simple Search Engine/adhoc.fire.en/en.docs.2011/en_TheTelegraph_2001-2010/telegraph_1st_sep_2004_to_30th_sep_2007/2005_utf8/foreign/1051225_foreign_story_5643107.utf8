 Cherie rules out politics after Blair term ends

 GEORGE JONES

 Cherie Blair: Been there

 London, Dec. 24: Cherie Blair has firmly ruled out embarking on a career in politics after her husband Tony leaves 10 Downing Street.

 Cherie Blair made her intentions known in an interview on NBCs Today programme in her role as an ambassador for the 2012 Olympics.

 Asked if she had political ambitions, she replied: No, because I have been there.

 Cherie Blair unsuccessfully contested the 1983 general election as a Labour candidate in Thanet. Her husband, standing at the same time, won the safe Labour seat of Sedgefield which launched him on a career that eventually reached Downing Street.

 Cherie Blair decided to focus on law, becoming a highly successful lawyer specialising in employment and human rights law, and more recently serving as a part-time judge.

 Blair has said that he will quit as Prime Minister before the next election and is expected to leave parliament, possibly to take up some international post.

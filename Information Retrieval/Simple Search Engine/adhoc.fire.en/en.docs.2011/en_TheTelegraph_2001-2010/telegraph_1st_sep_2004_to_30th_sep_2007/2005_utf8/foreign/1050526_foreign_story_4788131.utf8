 Judge vote

 Washington, May 25 (Reuters): The US Senate today confirmed the first of President George W. Bushs disputed judicial nominees, part of a truce between Democrats and Republicans that will allow the White House to get some of its most conservative choices on the federal bench.

 By a largely party-line vote of 56 to 43, the Republican-led chamber confirmed Texan Priscilla Owen for the 5th US circuit court of appeals in New Orleans. The vote was made possible by a compromise that averted a possible shutdown of the Senate.

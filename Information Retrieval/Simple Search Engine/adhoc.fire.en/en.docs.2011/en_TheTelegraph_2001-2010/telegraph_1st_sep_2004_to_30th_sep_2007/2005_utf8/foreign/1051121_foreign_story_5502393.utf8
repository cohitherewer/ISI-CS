 Bush sermon hits Great Wall of Hu

 Beijing, Nov. 20 (Agencies): President George W. Bush appealed to China today to expand religious, political and social freedoms but his counterpart said Beijing would not ape a western-style political system.

 Chinese President Hu Jintao said his country would improve human rights according to the actual situation. 

 China will continue to build up democracy with its own characteristics and improve its peoples human rights based on the actual situation and the aspirations of the people, Hu said after a 90-minute meeting with Bush at the Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square.

 Bush pressed Hu to rein in Chinas swelling trade surplus and push forward currency reforms. But there were few signs that China had offered any major concessions with Hu retracing old steps with statements on willingness to cooperate further on the currency and trade.

 The near-perennial American trade deficit with China, a lightning rod for criticism in the US Congress, could top $200 billion this year.

 At a joint news conference after their talks, Hu said he and Bush had expressed a willingness to join hands together to achieve more equitable trade and China would press ahead with the reform of its yuan currency.

 Hu, who accepted an invitation to visit Washington, most likely in the spring, also pledged Chinas cooperation in fighting the widespread piracy of American goods ranging from music and films to birth control pills and brake pads, which costs US manufacturers billions in lost sales each year.

 Continuing a theme of his four-country Asia tour, Bush said it was important that social, political and religious freedoms grow in China. To underscore this, the US President attended a Sunday service at Gangwashi Church, one of five officially recognised Protestant churches in the capital.

 Security officials cordoned off an area of several hundred metres around the church in western Beijing, which was heavily guarded by police in riot gear and plain clothes as groups of bemused locals stood around waiting for the president to pass by.

 May God bless the Christians of China, Bush wrote in the church guest book. His wife, Laura, added: With love and respect. The pastor gave them Chinese Bibles.

 Outside, the church choir treated Bush to a chorus of Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee in Chinese.

 US officials were concerned when a Chinese court recently sentenced a Protestant minister, his wife and her brother to prison terms of up to three years for illegally printing Bibles and other Christian publications.

 My hope is that the government of China will not fear Christians who gather to worship openly, Bush told reporters. A healthy society is a society that welcomes all faiths.

 Before coming to Beijing, Bush urged China to make political reforms.

 , holding up its political rival Taiwan, which Beijing regards as part of China, as an example of a model democracy.

 China has played down Bushs comments. Hu said he had told Bush of Chinas unswerving commitment to a road of peaceful development and Chinas development in terms of democratic politics and human rights.

 China has about 80 million Christians and allows worship in officially sanctioned churches. But tens of millions attend underground churches that refuse to accept state authority.

 Hu also told Bush he was committed to peace and stability in the Taiwan strait and would do his utmost to strive for peaceful unification. This being said, we will by no means tolerate so-called Taiwan independence, Hu said.

 Bush faces rising concern among US politicians and manufacturers about the cheap yuan currency, and the President said Washington and Beijing would cooperate in making the yuans exchange rate more responsive to market-driven forces.

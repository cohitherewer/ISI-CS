 Saudi phones

 Riyadh, April 16 (Reuters): Anyone using camera phones to distribute pornography may face up to 1,000 lashes, a 12-year jail term and a 100,000 riyal ($26,670) fine under a proposed Saudi law. 

 The proposed law comes after a Saudi court in January sentenced three men to jail and up to 1,200 lashes each for filming the rape of a girl using telephones equipped with cameras and distributing the footage via the telephones.

 Britons link 9/11 with Gunpowder Pslot

 London, Nov. 5 (Reuters): Comparisons with the September 11 attacks on the US were invoked as Britons marked today the 400th anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot, in which Catholic conspirators tried to blow up the English parliament.

 Every November 5, the British set off fireworks, light bonfires and burn an effigy of Guy Fawkes, one of the conspirators, to celebrate the foiling of the 1605 plot aimed at killing Englands Protestant king and hundreds of dignitaries.

 But this years fourth centenary has led to an outpouring of articles and documentaries, with commentators likening the plotters to the al Qaida network, blamed for the September 11, 2001, attacks on New Yorks World Trade Center and the Pentagon.

 Some, however, have suggested now is the time to end the ritual bonfire night burning of Fawkes as an anachronism.

 The repercussions of the massive explosion (in 1605) would have been even more devastating than the attacks on the Twin Towers in September 2001, said historian Antonia Fraser.

 The Gunpowder Plotters were driven by the exactly the same motivation that drove Mohamed Atta and his fellow hijackers to fly the planes and their terrified passengers into the World Trade Center, Fraser wrote in the Daily Mail.

 The plotters even had an Osama bin Laden figure in Robert Catesby, who provided the money and the organisation for the conspirators, said commentator Philip Johnston.

 The conspirators believed that religion was of primary importance, as do Islamic jihadis today, and that violent insurrection was a legitimate response to a government and society that refused to subscribe to their way of seeing the world, Johnston wrote in the Daily Telegraph.

 The anniversary comes as Prime Minister Tony Blairs government is struggling to pass fresh counter-terrorism laws after suicide bombings killed 52 people in London in July.

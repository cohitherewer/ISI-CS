 Candid book

 New York, Aug. 27 (AP): Iraqi prisoners could lift their cell doors right off their hinges. One senior sergeant whiled away his evenings blasting grazing sheep with a guard-tower machine gun. 

 The only woman commanding general in the war zone, Abu Ghraib prison chief Janis Karpinski, has written a memoir of her fateful year there, a candid portrait of an often dysfunctional US army. The book, One Womans Army, sheds little new light on the prison abuse scandal, in which Karpinski, an army reserve brigadier general, was the highest-ranking officer punished, reprimanded and demoted to colonel.

 Russia roars for Soviet salve

 Moscow, Jan. 22 (Reuters): Thousands of poor Russians demonstrated across Russia today as part of a campaign of protest against abolition of some benefits that has dented President Vladimir Putin?s popularity. 

 Several thousand pensioners gathered in the centre of Moscow demanding the government be fired and calling on Putin to resign over a decision to give cash payouts in lieu of social benefits, such as free travel, a legacy of the Soviet era. 

 Demonstrators led by the Communist Party carried placards reading: ?Stop robbing pensioners?, ?Putin resign? and ?Hitler+Yeltsin+Putin=genocide? as well as red flags and portraits of former communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Josef Stalin.

 The communists, who control 48 seats in the 450 seat parliament and constitute the only real organised Opposition to Putin, also led a thousand people in the southern city of Stavropol in protest against the cash payouts. 

 Opponents say they do not cover the benefits and leave many pensioners, used to cheap basic amenities such as housing and energy in Soviet times, living in deep poverty.

 ?Volodya (Vladimir Putin), what on earth do you think you?re doing to the country?? said Vadim, a former KGB officer in his 60s, at the Moscow demonstration.

 Protests against replacing benefits from the start of the year led Putin, president since 2000, to publicly chide members of the government over the way the substitution was carried out.

 An opinion poll published in the Izvestia daily said yesterday the benefits crisis had reduced the number of people who said they would vote for Putin to 43 per cent, from 48 per cent last month.

 Finance minister Alexei Kudrin said yesterday the government took full blame for the move and that he might draw on a budget stabilisation fund to boost pensioner payouts. 

 Some Opposition parties, dealt a heavy blow in 2003 parliamentary polls dominated by a pro-Kremlin party, are attempting to use popular discontent over the measures to make their mark again after more than a year in the background.

 Communists and the nationalist Rodina party led several thousand protesters in Samara in central Russia. About five thousand people in Ufa in the Urals also demanded the dismissal of the local government over the benefits issue. 

 About 200 people, headed by communists and local trade unions, held a two-hour demonstration against electricity price hikes, which affected not only pensioners, in Krasnoyarsk in Siberia.

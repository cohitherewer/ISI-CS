 Presidents put up bonhomie show

 Moscow, May 9 (Reuters): President George W. Bush and Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin put on their own show of bonhomie at todays grand military parade on Red Square, setting aside political strains as they smiled and chatted like old friends.

 The body language between Bush and Putin was clearly warm. When Bush and his wife, Laura, were met at Red Square by Putin and his wife, Lyudmila, the two leaders made a show of lowering their umbrellas for photographers.

 This was just after Putin gave a much more restrained greeting to Ukraines President Viktor Yushchenko, whose face is scarred by dioxin poisoning he blames on political enemies.

 Putins very public support for Yushchenkos opponent in elections late last year was widely seen as a public relations disaster for the Kremlin, particularly in the West.

 Seated together in the center of the reviewing stand at Red Square, the red brick walls of the Kremlin towering behind them, Putin touched Bushs arm and they chatted amiably as elaborate ceremonies marking the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe proceeded.

 It is the first time a US President has attended a Russian military parade in the cobble-stoned Red Square on such a grand scale. Parading before Bush were goose-stepping soldiers under the hammer-and-sickle flag that symbolised communism and the glory days of the Soviet Union, a reminder of the Cold War.

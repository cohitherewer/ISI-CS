 Hillary for fast action to prevent disasters

 Johannesburg, July 11 (Reuters): Global warming is melting glaciers around Mount Everest, threatening the environment and local people, the first man to climb the worlds tallest peak said today as he called on the UN to act.

 Sir Edmund Hillary, who reached Everests summit with Sherpa Tenzing Norgay in 1953, said he was backing calls by pressure groups such as Friends of the Earth for the UN cultural body Unesco to place the mountain on its endangered list.

 The warming of the environment of the Himalayas has increased noticeably in the last 60 years, Hillary said in a statement released as the Unesco World Heritage Committee met in Durban, South Africa.

 This has caused several and severe floods from glacial lakes and much disruption to the environment and local people, he added. Draining the lakes before they get to a dangerous condition is the only way to stop disasters. The Unesco committee tomorrow will consider petitions for three sites environmental groups say should be ruled endangered, forcing governments to act to protect them.

 As well as Nepals Everest National Park, campaigners say the glaciers in Huascaran National Park in the Peruvian Andes are also melting fast, while the Belize Barrier Reef is threatened by rising sea temperatures killing off coral.

 Peter Roderick of the pressure group Climate Justice Programme said the World Heritage Convention required all nations to keep World Heritage Sites intact for future generations.

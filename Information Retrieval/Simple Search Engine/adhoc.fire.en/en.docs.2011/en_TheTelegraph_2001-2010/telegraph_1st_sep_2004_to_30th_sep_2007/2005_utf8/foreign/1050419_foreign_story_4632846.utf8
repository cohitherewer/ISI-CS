 New state of matter

 Washington, April 18 (Reuters): Scientists using a giant atom smasher said today they have created a new state of matter ? a hot, dense liquid made out of basic atomic particles ? and said it shows what the early universe looked like for a very, very brief time.

 For a tiny fraction of a second after the ?big bang? birth of the universe, all matter was in the form of this liquid, called a quark-gluon plasma, the researchers said.

 ?We have a new state of matter,? said Sam Aronson, associate laboratory director for High Energy and Nuclear Physics at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.

 ?We think we are looking at a phenomenon ... in the universe 13 billion years ago when free quarks and gluons ... cooled down to the particles that we know today,? Aronson said.

 The quark-gluon plasma was made in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider ? a powerful atom smasher at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York. Unexpectedly, the quark gluon plasma behaved like a perfect liquid of quarks, instead of a gas. For their experiment, the researchers smashed two gold ions together at extremely high speeds, very close to the speed of light. The collision was so intense that the strong force that usually binds quarks into protons and neutrons weakened, allowing the quarks to roam freely.

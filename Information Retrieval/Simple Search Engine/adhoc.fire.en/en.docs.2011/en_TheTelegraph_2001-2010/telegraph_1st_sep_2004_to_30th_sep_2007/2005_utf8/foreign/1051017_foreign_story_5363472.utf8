 Danube delta wakes up to bird flu alarm

 Bucharest, Oct. 16 (Reuters): Romanian authorities slaughtered poultry and sent in doctors today after the deadly strain of bird flu was confirmed in the Danube delta, as officials elsewhere in Europe prepared for a possible pandemic.

 British laboratory tests showed yesterday that the H5N1 strain of the disease had reached mainland Europe for the first time, identifying it in three ducks found dead in the Romanian village of Ceamurlia de Jos.

 Experts fear the H5N1 virus, which has killed more than 60 people and caused the death of millions of birds in Asia since 2003, could mutate and spread easily among humans, creating a pandemic that might kill tens of millions of people.

 Romanian agriculture minister Gheorghe Flutur said the outbreak was limited to Ceamurlia and Maliuc, 40 km north. All 18,000 domestic birds in Ceamurlia were killed and culling of Maliucs less than 3,000 poultry was under way.

 On a 10-kme radius around Ceamurlia de Jos, the tests (for bird flu) are negative, Flutur said.

 But officials stepped up public health precautions even though no human cases of bird flu have so far been reported from Romania or from Turkey, which also confirmed H5N1 among domestic fowl last week.

 We have sent more doctors to the contaminated areas, and they will go from house to house to see how many people face the risk of being infected with the virus, health minister Eugen Nicolaescu told a news conference.

 The Danube delta, Europes largest wetlands near the Black Sea, is a major way station for migratory wild birds heading from Russia, Scandinavia, Poland and Germany towards warmer winter climes in North Africa.

 Despite the Romanian assurances, Britains chief medical officer said today his country was braced for a pandemic of bird flu that could result in at least 50,000 deaths there.

 Liam Donaldson echoed previous warnings by saying history suggested the bird flu virus could combine with a human flu virus and become easily transmissible.

 Once in a while, every 10 to 40 years, the flu virus mutates into a strain which we havent got natural immunity to, he told BBC TV. He said a normal winter flu kills more than 12,000 people in Britain.

 If we had a (bird flu) pandemic the problem would be the existing vaccines dont work, we would need a new vaccine, said Donaldson. So the estimate we are working towards is around 50,000 excess deaths from flu, but it could be a lot higher.

 There was no immediate sign of Turkeys outbreak spreading. A health ministry official said yesterday that nine people under observation in hospital for possible bird flu had been allowed to go home as tests showed they were not infected.

 Early tests on 1,000 chickens that died in eastern Turkey after being sent from the infected northwestern area did not point to bird flu, a senior veterinarian was quoted as saying. But officials stopped poultry transport in the province.

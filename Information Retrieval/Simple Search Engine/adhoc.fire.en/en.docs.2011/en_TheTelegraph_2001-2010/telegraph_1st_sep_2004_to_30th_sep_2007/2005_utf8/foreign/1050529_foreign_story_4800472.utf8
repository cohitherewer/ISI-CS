 Fine Print

 4 paw guide

 Rome, May 28 (Reuters): Forget fine wines and deluxe suites, the restaurants and hotels in a new Italian guide get four paws for homemade dog food and vet service.

 More than 1,600 hotels and inns made the cut while 222 eateries across Italy were included in the 2005 edition of In Italy with dogs and cats.

 The guides are meant to encourage Italians to take their dogs and cats on holiday rather than dump them on the roadside as they head to the beach for summer vacation.

 Fruit fakes

 Miami (Reuters): Customs agents inspecting a shipment of 

plantains thought some of the green bananas seemed unusually hard and cut them 

open, finding more than 338 kg of cocaine stuffed inside what turned out to be 

phoney fruit. Smugglers moulded the plantains out of glass fibre, filled them 

with cocaine and painted them to look like the real fruit.

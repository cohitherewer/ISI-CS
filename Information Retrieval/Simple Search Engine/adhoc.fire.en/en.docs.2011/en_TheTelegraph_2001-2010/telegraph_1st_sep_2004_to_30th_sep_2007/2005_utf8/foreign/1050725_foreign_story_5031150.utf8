 Besieged Arroyo in survival speech

 Manila, July 24 (Reuters): President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo must give the speech of her political life tomorrow to convince Filipinos and foreign investors she can overcome scandals to deliver on her economic and social reforms.

 The achievements and plans set out in the annual state of the nation address will fall on deaf ears among enemies trying to impeach her in Congress and the Left, students, farmers and opposition groups planning street protests as she speaks.

 Arroyos message will be aimed at the rest of the 86 million people in the Philippines and investors who fear political turmoil will delay efforts to raise revenues, cut debt and develop an economy that trails much of Southeast Asia.

 I suspect shes going to try to calm everyone down, talk about her constitutional legitimacy, avoid talking about impeachment and emphasise shes getting back to business, Tom Green, executive director of risk consultancy Pacific Strategies amp; Assessments, said today.

 Itll probably ring rather hollow at this stage because everybody knows where she is focused.

 Arroyo, defying calls that she step down, has ridden out resignations and defections that appeared to be pushing her four-year presidency to a quick end.

 But her survival in office is far from certain.

 Senator Miriam Santiago, an ally to the President, said yesterday that Arroyo would be conciliatory in her speech and ask Filipinos for a second chance.

 The Opposition accuses Arroyo of cheating her way to a fresh term in last years election and members of her family of taking kickbacks from a popular but illegal numbers game.

 Mrs Arroyo no longer has any credibility left in her body, so whatever she says will have no meaning for the people, said Senate minority leader Aquilino Pimentel, who has vowed to join a boycott of the speech by some opposition law-makers.

 Arroyos political pull also will be on the line tomorrow, when Congress returns from recess to consider an impeachment complaint against her based on charges of cheating, corruption and betraying the public trust.

 The Opposition must get 79 votes, or one-third of the members of the lower house, to send the motion for trial by the 23 senators in the upper house. Conviction by two-thirds of the senators would effectively sack the President.

 With alliances shifting during the crisis, analysts said the count in the lower house could be close. Some Opposition members said the number of votes was just shy of 79 but they would take the motion to the lower houses justice committee if it failed to win support on the floor. 

 The Presidents opponents are united in wanting her out but are otherwise fragmented and have offered few alternatives on how they would run the country.

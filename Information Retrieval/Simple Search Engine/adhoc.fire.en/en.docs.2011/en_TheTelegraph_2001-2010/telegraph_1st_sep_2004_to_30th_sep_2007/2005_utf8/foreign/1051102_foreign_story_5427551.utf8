 G8 hot seat for Russia

 Moscow, Nov. 1 (Reuters): Russia today said it would chair meetings of finance ministers from the Group of Eight nations next year, potentially boosting its standing in a global policy forum it has in the past attended as a mere observer.

 Finance minister Alexei Kudrin said the first meeting would be held on February 10 and 11 in Moscow, with a further session in May or June in St. Petersburg.

 Former President Boris Yeltsin was first invited to a Group of Seven summit in 1997 and Russia won full political membership of an enlarged G8 in 2002. It assumes the rotating presidency of this body in 2006.

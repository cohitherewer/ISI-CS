 Hawaii chunk falls into ocean

 CATHERINE ELSWORTH

 Los Angeles, Dec. 5: A 

 vast chunk of Hawaiian coastline has broken off and fallen 

 into the sea after a volcanic shelf collapsed at Hawaii 

 Volcanoes National Park.

 The 44-acre section exposed a 60 foot cliff and sent a plume of molten lava six feet in diameter shooting from the cliff face 45 feet above the water. The dramatic stream of lava formed a ramp of new land and continued to pour out into the ocean, sending up towers of steam.

 The collapse of solidified lava and sea cliff, which happened a week ago today, is the largest since the Kilauea volcano began its current eruption in 1983. 

 It took about four and a half hours for the shelf and cliff to tumble into the sea. Geologists had expected the break because of seismic rumblings. 

 Jim Kauahikaua, scientist-in-charge of the US Geological Surveys Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, said a warning of possible collapse was issued in June because the shelf had become very large, formed cracks and was in an area where other large collapses had previously occurred.

 Access to the area along the coast where visitors to the park congregate to watch the lava enter the water was restricted by the National Park Service.

 Witnesses described the collapse as spectacular. The cliff just caved away like a glacier, said Jim Gale, a spokesman for the park. 

 Theres this gigantic steam plume and you see the red just falling down, an incredible fire-hose display.

 The collapse prompted lumps of lava and head-size boulders to be spat out across the surrounding area. 

 Thin strands of volcanic glass known as Peles hair and sheets of volcanic glass called limu Pele, after the Hawaiian goddess of fire, were found 1,800 feet inland. Land collapses are relatively common. 

 In 1996, a 27-acre area collapsed into the sea without warning and in 1999, 25 acres of new unstable land fell into the sea. In 1996, a 27-acre area collapsed into the sea without warning.

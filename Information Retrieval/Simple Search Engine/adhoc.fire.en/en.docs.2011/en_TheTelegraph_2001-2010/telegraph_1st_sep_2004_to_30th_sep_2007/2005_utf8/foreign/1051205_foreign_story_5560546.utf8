 Prince battles the prowlers

 ANDREW ALDERSON

 Kate: No prying, please

 London, Dec. 4: Prince 

 William is personally masterminding attempts to ensure that 

 his girlfriend, Kate Middleton, can pursue a normal 

 life and career away from the prying lenses of the paparazzi.

 The Sunday Telegraph has learnt that the prince has mastered complex privacy laws and may ask lawyers to go to the European Court of Human Rights if the situation worsens.

 According to his friends, William feels that Kates future happiness and the survival of their relationship depend on protecting her from overly-intrusive photographers.

 The prince, 23, held discussions with Kates millionaire father, Michael Middleton, over publication of photographs of her on a London bus going for a job interview.

 Last month, Kate was again photographed in London, shopping with her mother, Carole.

 It is understood that the prince and Kate were behind the decision in October to send a solicitors letter to newspapers requesting that details of her private life stay private.

 The letter, from Harbottle amp; Lewis, who act for Kate and advise the prince on media matters, also questioned whether some photographers had breached guidelines from the Press Complaints Commission, the media watchdog.

 The prince has been briefed on privacy issues by Paddy Harverson, his fathers communications secretary. 

 If necessary, Harverson, in turn, consults Gerrard Tyrrell, also of Harbottle amp; Lewis, Prince Charless media lawyer.

 Friends of William say he is devoted to Kate. The relationship is considered so serious that she is reported to have met the Queen.

 One courtier said: There is no big issue at the moment because the level of intrusion has calmed down. But this is something Prince William is concerned about. He has learnt from his own experiences but he has always had concerns for others who have suffered intrusion solely because of their links to him.

 The Sunday Telegraph understands that William wanted to know the implications for his girlfriend of the landmark ruling won by Princess Caroline of Monaco last year in the Strasbourg court.

 The ruling, after years of harassment by the paparazzi, prevented the German press from publishing photographs of her and her children. The court said the German courts had failed to prevent her privacy being violated.

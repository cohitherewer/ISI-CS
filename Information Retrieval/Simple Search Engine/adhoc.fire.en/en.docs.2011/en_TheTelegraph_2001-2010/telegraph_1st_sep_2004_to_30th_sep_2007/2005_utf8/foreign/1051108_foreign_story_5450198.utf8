 Bullying bother in UK offices

 London, Nov. 7 (Reuters): British businesses lose 18 million working days a year from staff going sick with stress from bullying, unions said today.

 The Trades Union Congress said its research indicated that two million people had been bullied at work in the past six months. It said a survey of 5,000 workers had found that in three quarters of cases the bully was a manager or supervisor.

 But in many cases the managers are themselves bullied by their own bosses, with half of middle managers telling a union survey they had been bullying victims at some point. TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said he wanted the government to introduce new laws to stop bullying at work. 

 These figures suggest there can be few workplaces in the UK without a resident bully, said Barber.

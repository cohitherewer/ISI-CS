 Move to drag Iran to UN council shelved

 United Nations, Sept. 15 (Reuters): Western powers appeared today to back away from an earlier move to refer Irans nuclear programme to the UN Security Council as Tehran sought to widen backing for its stance by offering to share peaceful nuclear technology with other Islamic nations.

 French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin said the three major European powers that have been negotiating with Iran on its nuclear ambitions ? Britain, France and Germany ? were still giving priority to talks.

 We want to pursue the dialogue. We want Iran to suspend various activities. We think there is still room for negotiations, he said at the UN headquarters. If that failed, there would be no choice but to take the matter to the Security Council, he added.

 Earlier, US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice acknowledged that the US and its European allies may lack the votes to haul Iran before the highest UN body next week over its resumption of uranium conversion.

 If we get a referral on September 19, that will be good, but I think the issue of a referral is something that well be working for a while, she told Fox News Editorial board.

 Foreign ministers of the three European nations and EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana were to meet new Iranian foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki on the sidelines of a UN summit, diplomats said. We want to give the new Iranian authorities every opportunity, an EU diplomat said. We have never closed the door to negotiation. It always remained our preferred route.

 European officials said they were struggling to build a convincing majority on the board of the International Atomic Energy Authority, the world nuclear watchdog, to report Iran to the Security Council. 

 We would not like to be in a situation diplomatically where we have so many countries voting against our motion, the diplomat said.

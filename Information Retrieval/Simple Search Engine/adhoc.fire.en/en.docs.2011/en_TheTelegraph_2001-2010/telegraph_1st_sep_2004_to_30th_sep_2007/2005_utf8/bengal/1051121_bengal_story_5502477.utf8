 BRIEFS

 Burdwan, Nov. 20: Kalpana Mondal, 40, who was accused of girl trafficking, fled from custody at Katwa police station this morning. 

 Mondal had been picked up on Friday from a rented house at Kachhari Road in Katwa, 180 km from Calcutta. Accused of abducting and selling a girl in Delhi five years ago, she had been remanded in police custody for 12 days. A police team was scheduled to leave with her for Delhi to rescue Lakshmi Rani Saha, the girl she had sold off to flesh trade. A preliminary probe had revealed that Kalpana picked girls from remote villages. In 1999, she picked Lakshmi Rani, the daughter of small trader of Katwa. 

 Calcutta: Thirteen CPI (Maoist) leaders, all members of its action squad, were brought here on Sunday from Midnapore Central Jail. The shift comes in the wake of the Maoist raid on Bihars Jehanabad jail to free inmates. The rebels brought here have been lodged in the Presidency and Alipore jails.

 Calcutta: Abha Mondal, 58, was run over by a car on Diamond Harbour Road at Behala on Sunday night. The car fled. Residents blocked the road for three hours.

 No poll, no throne: Left to Ghisingh

 OUR BUREAU

 Siliguri/Calcutta, Feb. 26: Urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya today said in Siliguri that the CPM and its hill allies would oppose Subash Ghisingh as the government administrator of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council if the elections to the panel are not held by March 25.

 In Calcutta, the Left Front echoed that it was opposed to appointing Ghisingh as administrator of the council. ?We have urged the state government to hold elections to the council. If they are not held, an administrator could be appointed. But Ghisingh should not be appointed administrator under any circumstance,? asserted Left Front chairman Biman Bose after a coalition meeting at the CPM?s Alimuddin Street headquarters.

 Bhattacharya echoed Bose. ?We are not ready to accept Ghisingh as administrator or head of any consultancy committee,? he said after a meeting of the CPM, CPI and People?s Democratic Front parties at the Siliguri circuit house that was presided by senior CPM leader Ananda Pathak.

 ?In any case, it is too early to talk about who will be the administrator of the council if the elections do not take place. It has to be decided through proper constitutional means and amendments of the DGHC Act,? said the minister.

 Bhattacharya?s remarks come in the wake of rumours that one option before the government is appointing Ghisingh the administrator of the council to enable elections to the panel to be held in April or May. Parties opposed to the GNLF feel this would give Ghisingh an advantage.

 D.K. Pradhan, the Darjeeling legislator and the leader of the GNLF(C) said appointing Ghisingh administrator would mean a short-term gain. ?Instead of solving short-term issues, the government must try to find a long-term solution. If Ghisingh is appointed administrator, there will be long-term damage to the unity of the hill parties,? he said.

 ?Elections will have to be held on time,? Bhattacharya asserted. ?No further extension can be given to the DGHC.?

 The minister said the state and central governments must also take the consent of Opposition parties, including the CPM, in matters relating to the DGHC.

 ?The government must take the opinion of all parties before it takes any step concerning the DGHC elections or regarding appointing an administrator. We are willing to meet anywhere, be it Calcutta or Siliguri,? Bhattacharya said.

 In Calcutta, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government has started working on an amendment of the Darjeeling Gorkha Autonomous Hill Council Act, preparations for which had started at Writers? Buildings last week. The main aim is to appoint an administrator or a board of administrators to run the council after its term expires on March 25.

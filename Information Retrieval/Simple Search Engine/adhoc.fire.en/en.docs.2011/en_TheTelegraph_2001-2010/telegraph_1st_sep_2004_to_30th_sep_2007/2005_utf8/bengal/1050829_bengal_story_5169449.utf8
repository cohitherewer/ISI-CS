 Citu plays spoiler, again

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Aug. 28: A 97-year-old rice mill was forced to close down today because of a Citu agitation in the CPM stronghold of Alamganj when Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is busy wooing foreign investors saying that the labour scenario is changing in the state.

 Mill owner Tapan Dutta faxed a letter to the chief minister and commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen today, pleading for their intervention. 

 He also wondered whether he was facing abuse from the union because he was doing business in Left-ruled Bengal and expressed intention to wind up his familys businesses here, which run into crores.

 Citu leaders allegedly stopped work this morning and abused Dutta ? the owner of Nityakali Rice Mill, the oldest in Bengal, at Alamganj, about 115 km from Calcutta, ? when they went to discuss workers demands.

 Dutta said: Union leader Bhaktipada Bera, along with about a hundred workers, came to my office without any prior notice. I agreed to talk to them a little later as three industrialists from Bangladesh were in my office then. At this, they started abusing me and came to beat me up. They then stopped work without notice, The district Citu leadership denied Duttas allegations.

 The mill owner misbehaved when our Alamganj West local committee secretary, Bhaktipada Bera, went to discuss some demands with him along with workers. This has led to the closure of the mill. There is no information on our members misbehaving, said Citu district committee member Tushar Majumdar.

 Citu general secretary Kali Ghosh said in Calcutta that the leadership would take action against those who misbehaved with the mill owner. We also look forward to meeting Dutta if he comes to us with his problems, Ghosh said.

 Over the past 10 days, the Citu has been demanding official introduction of overtime for four workers engaged in the mills boiler section. 

 However, the management claimed that overtime was offered to the workers from the start even if it is not given under that particular head.

 Nityakali Rice Mill was set up in 1908 by Tapans grandfather Rajkrishna Dutta. It now employs 250 people and produces about a hundred tonnes of rice everyday.

 Suri/Behrampore: Ten people were killed by lightning in Birbhum and Murshidabad this afternoon. 

 In Birbhum, eight youths aged between 20 and 24 were struck down at Mitrapur, Chhandakpara and Subdihi, 320 km from Calcutta. Police said at Chhandakpara, Mujibar Sheikh, Milan Sheikh and Farid Sheikh were killed while working in the field. At Sub-dihi, Majahar Sheikh and Mahim Sheikh were repairing the roofs of their houses. Ikramul Sheikh, Asit Mal and Azizul Sheikh were also killed while working in the fields, at Mitrapur. In Murshidabad, Muklesur Rahman, 32, and Fazal Sheikh, 17, were killed while at work in a bidi making unit. 

 Calcutta: Information technology minister Manab Mukherjee said on Monday about 4.15 lakh youths will be employed in the IT sector in Bengal by 2010. Almost all major companies have sought land from the government. We will provide 13.3 million sq ft to them in two-and-a-half years to set up units where they will be able to accommodate about 4.15 lakh youths, Mukherjee told the Assembly while replying to the discussion on the infotech budget. Now, 220 IT companies operate in Calcutta and employ 30,000 people.

 Suri: The state electricity board has disconnected supply to Kopai station, 220 km from Calcutta, because bills to the tune of Rs 1 lakh had not been paid. The stationmaster said there was no allotment on that count.

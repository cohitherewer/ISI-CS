 Poll panel glare on I-card glitch

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 27: The Election Commission has detected irregularities in the distribution of electoral photo identity cards in Bengal and asked the states chief electoral officer to punish officials responsible for the lapse.

 Five commission teams that visited the state twice in recent weeks to inspect its poll preparedness found that though 92 per cent of the photo identity cards had been distributed, many had not been delivered to genuine voters.

 The flaws were detected at Suti-1 block of Murshidabad, Nurpur in Malda and Rajnagar in Birbhum. 

 The poll panel has ordered verification of all identity cards distributed in the three dis-tricts. Block development officers have been told to certify that the photo identity cards are being delivered to the right people and subdivisional officers asked to make random checks and report to the district magistrate. 

 A final report will have to be sent to the states chief electoral officer, Debasish Sen.

 In a missive to Sen, the poll panel has said that the identity cards have been distributed in a casual manner and in violation of instructions in Bengal. 

 The commission desires that responsibility should be clearly fixed up for such lapses and explanation of such delinquent officials should be called for and action taken in the matter should be intimated to the commission by January 5, the letter says.

 Poll panel sources said that according to guidelines laid down by the commission, the cards are to be handed over individually to voters but in Bengal, a bulk of them are given to one person for distribution.

 In Calcutta, Sen said: We have already initiated the probe. I have spoken to the district magistrates of Murshidabad, Malda and Birbhum. We are going to take action against those who were responsible for the lapses.

 Commission sources said that for voters who have been issued photo identity cards, no other proof of identity would be valid.

 The commission also has problems with the way disputes over electoral rolls are being settled in the state. 

 In a separate letter, it has said that special care should be taken while accepting or rejecting a claim for inclusion or deletion of names in the rolls. 

 During public hearings for disposal of such claims, the commission has found, several polling stations are clubbed together leading to long queues that keep away genuine voters. 

 Opposition parties had earlier complained to the commission about irregularities in the revision of electoral rolls.

 The term of the Assembly will end on June 13 and the commission has begun its preparations in earnest.

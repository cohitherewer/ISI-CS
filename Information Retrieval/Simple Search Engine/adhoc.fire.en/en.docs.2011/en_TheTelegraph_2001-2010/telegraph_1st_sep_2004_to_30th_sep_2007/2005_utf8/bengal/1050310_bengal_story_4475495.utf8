 Priya pat for mayor

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 9: Priya Ranjan Das Munshi today said the Congress is planning to fight the June 9 election to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation with support from all secular forces, implying an understanding with the Trinamul Congress.

 ?Last time, it would not have been possible for Subrata Mukherjee to become mayor without the support of the Congress,? the Union minister for water resources told party supporters at Shahid Minar.

 Das Munshi patted the mayor for an ?excellent job?. ?The chief minister has also admitted that. We don?t have any hesitation in praising him for the job done,? Das Munshi said, hinting that his party would have no problem accepting Mukherjee as mayor again if there is an electoral pact with Trinamul.

 Congress MP from Behrampore Adhir Chowdhury, an anathema to Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee, sang a different tune.

 He urged Trinamul leaders to come back to the Congress fold to defeat the CPM. ?The ruling CPM is decaying. The party is inflicted with cancer and it is high time for all anti-CPM forces to be united? to remove the party from power,? he said.

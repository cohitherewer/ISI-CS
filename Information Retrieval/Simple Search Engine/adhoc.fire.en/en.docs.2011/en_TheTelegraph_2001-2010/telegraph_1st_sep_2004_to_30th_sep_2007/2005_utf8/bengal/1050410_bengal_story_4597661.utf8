 Gunjan aide in CID net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 9: The Criminal Investigation Department last night arrested Munna Singh, an associate of the mastermind of Roma Jhawar?s abduction, for his involvement in the kidnapping and murder of Mithun Koley.

 CID officials working on the murder case said Singh, an employee of a state-run press, had kept Koley, son of a Dum Dum-based businessman, confined at his Kadapara residence for over two days.

 Singh was produced before the Salt Lake subdivisional judicial magistrate?s court today and remanded in police custody till April 16.

 Koley was abducted in front of a restaurant on November 10, 2003. Gunjan?s wife Rumela had asked him to meet her outside the eatery.

 Three days later, Koley was found lying on the premises of NRS Hospital with serious head injuries. After treatment for over a fortnight, the 20-year-old youth succumbed to his injuries.

 ?Gunjan used his wife to lay the trap. As soon as Koley came, Gunjan and his associates abducted him,? said an officer investigating the case.

 The CID officials decided to reopen the case after Rumela made a statement before of a judicial magistrate confessing her involvement in Koley?s abduction.

 Elaborating on Singh?s arrest, deputy inspector-general of police (operations), CID, Rajeev Kumar, said: ?After abducting the youth, Gunjan went straight to Singh?s residence. Koley was kept there for the next two days.?

 Around midnight on November 12, 2003, Koley was taken out from Singh?s residence and forced to board a Maruti Omni. ?Gunjan and his associates started beating up Koley ruthlessly inside the car. They hit his head with a blunt weapon and when he fell unconscious, they dumped him on the hospital premises,? said a CID officer.

 On what made Gunjan murder Koley, an officer said: ?He had identified Gunjan and his men. They would have been in trouble if he was released.?

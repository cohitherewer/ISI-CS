 Call for patience amp; praise

 RICHA BANSAL

 Calcutta, March 19: Disciplining a mischievous child or getting an inattentive student to listen without resorting to corporal punishment is an art that city teachers are yet to master, according to some school principals and psychologists in the city.

 Educationists admitted that the recent incident in Our Lady Queen of the Mission school was not an ?isolated one? and said more safeguards must be built into the system to ensure that children get better treatment in schools.

 ?I must say that such extreme cases are rare now-a-days, but I have to admit that teachers don?t always have the patience to deal with a naughty child,? said Margaret Neogi, the principal of Mother?s Care Montessori school.

 ?What they don?t realise is that it is important to make a child feel loved at the end of the day or else he might carry a psychological burden.?

 Parents of the child should be consulted in case of repeated bad behaviour, feel educationists. ?But, unfortunately, this is not a practice that is usually followed,? said Neogi.

 Misbehaviour in children often stems from family problems, which could range from too much academic pressure to lack of parental attention to sibling jealousy to an unhealthy home environment.

 ?Barring cases where a child beats others or is self-destructive, he should not be reprimanded at all,? said child psychiatrist Dr Bhargavi Chatterji Bhattacharya. ?Instead, the good qualities of a child should be appreciated and praised,? she said.

 ?Though we are realising that we need to shift from the traditional method of education to a more scientific one that takes child psychology into account, it is not really happening,? said Pradipta Kanungo, the headmistress of Patha Bhavan Primary School.

 Teachers have to accept that children will be naughty, according to Sharmila Bose, the principal of Birla High School for Girls. ?Our duty is to caution them, ask them not to repeat their misdemeanour and let the matter rest. This has to be done without making the child feel humiliated.?

 Calcutta, March 12: Rain and gusty winds today flattened an entire block of eastern India?s biggest computer fair, hours after its inauguration. 

 Compass 2005, scheduled to run from March 11 to 15 at the Maidan is now closed. 

 Spread across 50,000 square feet, opposite the Victoria Memorial, the fair ground was divided into three blocks. The block that collapsed was over 17,000 square feet and air-conditioned.

 The fair was declared open at 4 pm yesterday. But the sudden rain that hit the city, accompanied by strong winds, wreaked havoc hours later. At 5 this morning, the air-conditioned block collapsed like a pack of cards. 

 Ujjal Roy, a security guard, was at a loss for words while trying to describe the disaster. ?It was raining heavily?there was also a very strong wind. A few of us were sitting inside the block,? he said. 

 ?Suddenly, one side of it (the block) tilted. One of us brought in the security-in-charge. Moments after the officer entered, the structure began to collapse? We started running and I didn?t know where I was going. Somehow, I managed to escape unhurt.?

 Two of his colleagues were hurt, Roy added, shock and relief written on his face. 

 The block that housed 20 pavilions and over 50 stalls was reduced to a mesh of scattered steel frames and wooden structures. 

 Smashed air-conditioners, overturned furniture and scampering men completed the picture. 

 M.Q. Syed, the director of Mumbai-based Team Pinnacle, which had constructed the blocks, said: ?The damage is huge? around Rs 1.5 crore. I brought materials for the construction by 25 trucks from Mumbai, Delhi and Pune. ? 

 After a heavy shower around 7.30 yesterday evening, the organisers held an emergency meeting. 

 ?We planned to cancel the fair for Saturday, redo the structures and open it to the public from Sunday. But we didn?t get the time. The catastrophe hit us at 5 am,? Syed said.

 Utpal Banerjee of Supertron Electronics, which had rented a stall in the fair, said: ?Our total damage would amount to Rs 10-11 lakh.? 

 Ritu Yadav, who had decorated the alleyways using plants, fountains and marbles, was luckier. She said she has lost around Rs 35,000. ?I take part in many fairs, almost through the year, never have I seen a structure at a fair ground collapse like this,? she said.

 Adhir steps out of jail

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Dec. 24: A day after Calcutta High Court granted bail to Adhir Chowdhury in a case of double murder, the Congress MP was released today from Behrampore Central Jail.

 Over 6,000 Congress supporters who had gathered near the jail smeared green abir on each other to celebrate Chowdhurys release (the MP outside the jail in picture by Alamgir Hosain).

 A team of state Congress leaders, including working president Pradip Bhattacharya, PCC general secretary Manas Bhuniya and MLA Abdul Mannan, were also waiting at the jail gate for Chowdhurys release.

 Chowdhury was arrested from his official residence in Delhi on November 19 in connection with the murder of eatery owner Hanif Sheikh and his son Laltoo Sheikh in Behrampore in July this year.

 As Chowdhury came out of the jail around 1.30 pm, the crowd shouted slogans like Adhir Chowdhury zindabad and Vande Mataram.

 With hundreds of supporters pressing against the gate, its iron bolt snapped and supporters ran into the jail compound.

 Chowdhury and the Congress leaders led the procession of supporters to the district Congress headquarters, about half-a-kilometre from the jail.

 Addressing a news conference at the party office, Chowdhury alleged that state CPM secretary Anil Biswas and a section of Murshidabad police had conspired against him but he would prove that the charges against him were false.

 With elections approaching, the CPM is scared. It wants to put me behind bars by hook or by crook. If I am proved guilty, I will put a garland of shoes round my neck and walk to the CPM headquarters in Alimuddin Street, said Chowdhury.

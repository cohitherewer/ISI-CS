 Fixed phones in fossil threat

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 24: Fixed phone users appear to be a dwindling race going by BSNL sources.

 Nearly 90,000 BSNL subscribers have surrendered their connections in Calcutta between April and November. 

 Over three years, about 100,000 subscribers have surrendered their phones every year. This time, the number is even bigger, a senior CalTel official said.

 This is a worldwide phenomenon, the growth is in the mobile phone sector, BSNL chairman and managing director A.K. Sinha said. 

 He was in the city today to inaugurate an information and media centre at Telephone Bhavan and a customer service centre at Alipore.

 Sinha said across India, 25 lakh BSNL subscribers have surrendered their fixed phones till November. 

 Revenue earned from fixed lines is also on the decline, but Sinha said the loss would be compensated by growth in mobile and broadband services. Rise in connections in rural areas was also a positive.

 CalTel chief general manager S.K. Chakraborty was also optimistic about increase in the number of landline users with the demand for broadband connectivity going up.

 CalTel sources said that desperate to arrest the fall, the authorities are planning serious marketing initiatives. Individual agents are also being appointed to sell B-phone (base or fixed phone) and broadband connections, they said.

 Sinha said though the target was to give one lakh broadband connections in Calcutta by December 31, BSNL would be able to give half that number. 

 There are 30,000 subscribers of Data One, BSNLs broadband service, in the city and about 20,000 are on the waiting list.

 We are trying to popularise high-speed Internet connectivity, Sinha said, adding in the same breath that he had received several complaints from subscribers dogged by poor service and slow connectivity. 

 Chakraborty said: The problem is being sorted out.

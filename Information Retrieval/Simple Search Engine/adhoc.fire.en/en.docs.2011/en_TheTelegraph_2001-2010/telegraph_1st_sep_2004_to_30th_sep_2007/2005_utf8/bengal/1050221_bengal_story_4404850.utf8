 New runway recce ready for takeoff

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, Feb. 20: Eighteen years after he launched the initiative to connect two north Bengal districts with Calcutta by air, Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has managed to get the approval for another runway, this time for his home constituency Raiganj. 

 An Airports Authority of India (AAI) team will arrive here tomorrow to scout for a site even as efforts continue to restart the civil aerodromes at Malda and Balurghat that have been lying defunct for years. The services were grounded as not many were willing to shell the kind of money needed to fly to Calcutta.

 The sudden decision to create an airport in North Dinajpur has surprised many because no one in the past had raised demands to link North Dinajpur with Calcutta through air services. 

 Discussions over restarting air services in the north Bengal districts have always centred around Cooch Behar, Malda and Balurghat, from where Vayudoot, an Indian Airlines subsidiary, flew earlier. 

 AAI sources in Calcutta confirmed that Das Munshi got in touch with the Union civil aviation ministry with the plea to extend air services to Raiganj, the district headquarters. 

 They added that a facsimile message from Delhi, which said the proposal for an airport at Raiganj had been cleared, came to Calcutta on Friday. 

 The AAI team will send a report to Delhi after inspecting the sites which, the district administration has been told, have to be 4.3-km long and half-a-kilometre wide for the airport to be set up.

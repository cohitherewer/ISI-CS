 Minister charged

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Nov. 18: Police today filed a chargesheet against minister of state for labour Susanta Ghosh and six other CPM functionaries for their alleged involvement in a 16-year-old looting and arson case.

 In the papers filed before the second judicial magistrate of the Garbeta criminal court, the police said Ghoshs gang looted the shop of Ramlal Hansda, the then secretary of the Adivasi Social Educational and Cultural Association, at Chandrakona Road in April 1989 and instigated a mob to torch other shops and houses at Stationpara under Garbeta police station in West Midnapore, 160 km from Calcutta. 

 Ghosh was then the MLA from Garbeta (West). He was granted anticipatory bail on September 2, after he personally appeared before the magistrate. The case will be heard again on December 21.

 Early November, another CPM minister, Narayan Biswas, was sent to jail in South Dinajpur in connection with a 1988 looting and arson.

 Boys ear ruptured

 - Teachers off limits, reasons differ

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Raiganj, May 27: Prosenjit Ghosh has been lying in bed nursing a ruptured eardrum for the past two weeks.

 But a classroom full of witnesses and a doctors diagnosis vindicating the injury, if not the nature of assault, have not been enough for the authorities of Dwarikaprasad High School to take action against the teacher at fault.

 Instead, Prosenjits mother Pushpa alleged: The school is creating pressure on us to withdraw the police complaint we had lodged against the teacher. The police have not taken any action either.

 Friends of Prosenjit, a Class VIII student, said he was hauled up by Paritosh Roy, their math teacher, on May 12 for not doing homework.

 Four others and I had not done our math home work that day. As punishment, the teacher asked us to kneel down in front of the blackboard, said Prosenjit, who is suffering from balance problems because of the injury.

 The teacher then worked out a few problems on the board and asked the students to copy them.

 As I could not copy the sums from the board fast enough, Sir beat me up with a lathi. When I cried out in pain, he slapped me and I almost fainted, Prosenjit said. I just about managed to reach home that day. My head reels all the time and I hear strange noises. I even have difficulty sitting or standing.

 Pushpa brought the matter to the notice of the headmaster the next day. 

 Headmaster Sushil Goswami said: Corporal punishment is banned in our school. I spoke to the boys parents, his classmates and the teacher and I feel the charge is false. We got Prosenjit checked by an ENT specialist. I dont understand why his parents lodged a police complaint.

 However, Dr Shekhar Banerjee said Prosenjits eardrum had been ruptured. He has suffered an injury and is under close observation. 

 Roy has been attending classes, but the headmaster refused permission to speak to him. The local police declined comment.

 District superintendent of police Asoke Kumar Dutta said he would talk to the in-charge of the police station in which the complaint had been lodged.

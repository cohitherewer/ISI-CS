 Kallol stage pulled down

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Nov. 7: The stage set for Kallol on pontoons on the Hooghly was being dismantled this afternoon, hours before the Utpal Dutt play should have been enacted. 

 Buckling under pressure from the chief minister and his party, sports and youth affairs minister Subhas Chakraborty had yesterday agreed to shift the venue to Salt Lake stadium. Police had denied permission for the play to be staged on the river because of security concerns. 

 You would probably not get the same milieu at the new venue in Salt Lake? no real water or waves? but there will be an attempt to recreate the same atmosphere artificially, Chakraborty said today.

 Asked if Chakraborty was nosing into his domain ? staging plays ? the chief minister said this evening: There is no clash between (his) information and cultural affairs and (Chakrabortys) youth affairs departments. The government is behind both.

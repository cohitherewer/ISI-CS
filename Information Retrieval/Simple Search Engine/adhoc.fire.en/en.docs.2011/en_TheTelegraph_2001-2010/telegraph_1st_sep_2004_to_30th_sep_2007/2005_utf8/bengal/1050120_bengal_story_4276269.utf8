 Plot judge protests price 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Jan. 19: Former judge Bhagabati Prosad Banerjee has written a letter demanding proper evaluation of his house as the government set in motion the process to auction the Salt Lake property. 

 The Supreme Court had dismissed allotment of the plot in 1987 to the retired Calcutta High Court judge from the chief minister?s quota under ?inappropriate circumstances? and directed the government to auction the house and take over the plot. 

 The government has initiated proceedings though Banerjee has filed a revision petition in the Supreme Court. 

 The urban development department has fixed the price of the house at Rs 8.19 lakh but the former judge has refused to accept it, saying it is too less compared to present market value. He wrote on Monday to the department, demanding that his house be evaluated by a high court panelled valuer. 

 ?I am unable to accept the price offered by the government in view of the Supreme Court order, which has categorically said that I have to be offered the market price. I have to opt for the market price only and the price will have to be fixed on the basis of public auction,? Banerjee wrote.

 He added that the government will have to inform the people about the auction through advertisement so that interested persons could take part in the bidding.

 When contacted, Banerjee said the price offered by the government has no basis and is not acceptable. ?I do not know on what basis the urban development department has fixed the price of my 3,124 sq ft house at Rs 8.19 lakh. I have made it clear I shall accept only the market price. I have also informed the government about the revision petition in the apex court,? he said. 

 Urban development secretary K.S. Rajendrakumar said the government has moved on the basis of the court directive. ?The apex court has directed the government to offer a price to Banerjee and go for public auction if he refuses to accept it. We have fixed the price at Rs 8.19 lakh on the basis of its valuation in the year of construction (in 1994). As Banerjee has refused to accept the price, we are making arrangements for public auction,? Rajendrakumar said.

 Department officials said there would be two separate bidding, one for the building and another for the 4-cottah plot. ?We will invite bids by giving advertisement in prominent newspapers. The highest quoted (house) price will be given to Banerjee and the government will take the price for the land,?? one official said.

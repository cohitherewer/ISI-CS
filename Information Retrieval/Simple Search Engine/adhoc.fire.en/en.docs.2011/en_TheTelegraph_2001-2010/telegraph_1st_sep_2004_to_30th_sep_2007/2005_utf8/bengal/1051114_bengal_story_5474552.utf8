 BRIEFS

 Siliguri, Nov. 13: Mou Biswas, a first-year student of Siliguri Government Polytechnic College from Calcutta who apparently committed suicide in her hostel room yesterday, has held two boys responsible for her death. 

 Police refused to reveal the boys names. In a note the girl is believed to have left behind, she accused them of cheating without elaborating how. The only child of Amal Biswas was studying electronics and telecommunications engineering. Mou returned to the hostel yesterday earlier than usual and not on the college bus. She went straight to her room, said the hostel superintendent. Some time later, there was a call from her father. When students went to call her, she was hanging from the ceiling fan.

 Krishnagar: Kushilal Sarkar, a CPM activist, was shot dead on Saturday night in Ranaghat, 70 km from Calcutta. His wife Saraswati is the chief of the Habibpur panchayat. Police said Sarkar was sitting in his automobile spares shop with five associates around 8 pm when masked goons shot him. 

 Tarakeswar: The Hooghly administration on Sunday distributed photo-identity cards to 350 people who help pilgrims offer pujas at the temple here. To rein in rogue pandas, a meeting fixed Rs 21 as their fee for every band of visitors. A chart with rates of puja and bhog will be displayed outside the temple, 65 km from Calcutta.

 Calcutta: The UPA government must decide whether or not it wants Left support, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas told a convention to oppose the Centres foreign policy.

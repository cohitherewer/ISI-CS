 Demand to call House session

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 10: The Trinamul Congress and the Congress today demanded that a short session of the Assembly be convened this month to discuss burning issues like the proposed takeover of agricultural land for Salim Group projects, bogus voters in electoral rolls and the law-and-order situation.

 However, Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim said he is yet to get any recommendation to convene the House.

 Asked if the House will meet this month, Halim said he was not aware of it. The chief minister as the leader of the House will have to decide the date and timing of any session of the Assembly. I have not been asked by the government to convene the House as yet.

 The Assembly usually sits for a short winter session in December.

 The chief whip of the Left Front and CPM MLA from Ballygunge, Rabin Deb, said a short session of the Assembly might be convened in February.

 Pankaj Banerjee, the leader of the Opposition and Trinamul MLA from Tollygunge, said a delegation of Trinamul MLAs will call on the chief minister next week demanding the session this month.

 If Assembly elections are held in May, there will be little scope to discuss major issues in a session in February. The chief minister should take the initiative to convene the winter session this month, he said.

 Issues like acquisition of lands for the proposed Salim projects, continuous infiltration from a neighbouring country, inclusion of bogus names in voters list and the spurt in crime have to be discussed right now, he added.

 Banerjee said the government has started acquiring land for the proposed Salim Group projects though the company is yet to prepare a detailed project report of most of their projects. We have decided to raise specific questions in the Assembly about why the government is so keen to hand over lands to the Indonesia-based group, he added.

 He also demanded a discussion on infiltration from Bangladesh.

 We have prepared a list of Bangladeshi nationals whose names have appeared in the electoral rolls in the Gaighata Assembly constituency and some other constituencies in Malda and Murshidabad. We shall launch a statewide movement if the government delays in convening the session of the House, he said.

 Atish Sinha, the leader of the Congress legislature party, also said a short session is necessary to discuss certain major issues.

 SUCI MLA Debaprasad Sarkar said they have written to the Speaker requesting him to convene the winter session.

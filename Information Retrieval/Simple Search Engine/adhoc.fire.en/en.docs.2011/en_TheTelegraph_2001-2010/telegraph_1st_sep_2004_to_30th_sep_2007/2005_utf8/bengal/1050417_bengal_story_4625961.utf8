 Fake foreign cash factory

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta. April 16: Police busted an organised racket involved in counterfeiting South Korean currency on the northern fringes of the city.

 Spreading its tentacles from Birati on the outskirts of the city to the heart of South Korea, the gang had been busy manufacturing fake notes inside the offices of a cable channel company. 

 A software installed inside a computer in the digital studio of the channel was used to make the fake notes, the police said.

 ?We received a tip-off that a fake currency business was going on on the cable channel?s premises near Birati. A printing press, Calcutta Digital Printers, was behind the racket. We raided the place this morning and seized compact discs containing pictures of Korean notes of various denominations. Three persons have been arrested,? said Praveen Kumar, the district police chief of North 24-Parganas.

 The police learnt about the fake currency press when South Korean investigators got in touch with the CID after they arrested one person in Seoul on charges of possessing fake notes.

 ?The person confessed that the notes were all being smuggled from Bengal. After grilling him further, the Korean police learnt the address and immediately got in touch with us,? said an officer.

 Alerted by the CID, North 24-Parganas police raided the premises on MB Road, which is also the headquarters of the cable television channel.

 The owner of the printing press, Manashi Das, the manager and a technician have been arrested. The police also sealed the house and the press from where they found the discs.

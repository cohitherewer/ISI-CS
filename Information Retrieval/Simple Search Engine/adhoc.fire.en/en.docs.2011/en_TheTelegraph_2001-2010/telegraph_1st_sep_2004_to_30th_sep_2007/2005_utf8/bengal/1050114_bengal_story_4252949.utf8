 All-business Buddha aligns Left with right

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 13: Left ideology may be in conflict with market forces, but in Bengal they go hand in hand. This message was sent out loud by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Partnership Summit 2005.

 ?We are changing our old, obsolete ideas? Here, the Left is right,? the chief minister told delegates at the Confederation of Indian Industry?s flagship annual event.

 Bhattacharjee was the main attraction at the special plenary on Bengal ? The Sun Rises in the East ? on Day-II of the three-day meet. The chief minister led from the front to convince the audience about a Bengal that is resurgent and vibrating with opportunities. He reiterated the points at a lunch meeting that followed the interactive session chaired by B. Muthuraman, chairman, CII eastern region.

 ?I compliment the Bengal government for its approach and well-defined policies. From the Netherlands? point of view, business in Asia meant China and business in India meant the southern states. But this visit to Calcutta has opened my eyes,? said Eric Niehe, the Dutch ambassador.

 The Netherlands embassy in India is organising its first business meet in the city in February.

 Earlier, Bhattacharjee wooed the audience with his candour, a quality businessmen find charming.

 When someone wanted to know the downside of doing business in Bengal, he said it was infrastructure.

 ?We are open to public-private partnership to upgrade facilities,? he added.

 Tay Hun Kiat, of Singapore Technologies Electronics, said: ?We are into designing electronics systems for modern transportation and we want to be in Bengal.?

 A Chinese representative wanted to know when he would visit Yunan. ?I will love to go to your province as soon as possible,? came the reply. 

 Bhattacharjee also posed a few questions during the hour-long interactive session. When a Malaysian representative asked him about the government?s plans to scale up bilateral linkages, he shot back: ?First you tell me when will the first flight from Kuala Lumpur come to Calcutta?? 

 Sanjay Budhia, the honorary consul-general of Malaysia in Calcutta, informed him that the first flight will reach Dum Dum airport on January 28.

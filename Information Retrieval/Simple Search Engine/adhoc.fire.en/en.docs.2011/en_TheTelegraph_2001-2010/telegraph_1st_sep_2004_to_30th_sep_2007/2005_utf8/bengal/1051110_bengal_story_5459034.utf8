 Fruits and flowers for Marubeni

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 9: After transport and power, Japans Marubeni Corporation has turned to the state for fruits and flowers.

 Representatives from the Japanese company met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today. They want to procure our fruits and flowers, especially roses, for the supermarkets there. They have already started sourcing poultry and meat from Bengal, said a senior state government official who was present at the meeting.

 Bhattacharjee expressed eagerness to collaborate with the firm and even suggested that the company procure leather goods and IT software from the state. We pointed out that Bengal is ranked second after Tamil Nadu in the leather sector. They said they would consider the suggestion, the official said.

 Marubeni representatives, however, remained tight-lipped about todays meeting. 

 Bhattacharjee said he would make an announcement after the proposals have made some progress.

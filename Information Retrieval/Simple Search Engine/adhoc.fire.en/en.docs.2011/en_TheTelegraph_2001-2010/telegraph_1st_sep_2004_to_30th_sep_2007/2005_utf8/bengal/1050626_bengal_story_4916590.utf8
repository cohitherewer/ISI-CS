 Subratas Mancha blasts Congress on municipal polls

 Calcutta, June 25: Several members of Subrata Mukherjees Paschimbanga Unnyan Congress Mancha today accused the state Congress of jeopardising the organisations prospects in the just-concluded civic body polls, reports our special correspondent.

 Mukherjee, the former mayor, had quit Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress to float the Mancha and had contested elections to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation under the banner of the United Democratic Alliance.

 Out of 36 nominees that the Mancha had put up as part of an electoral agreement with the Congress, only four, including Mukherjee, won.

 Congress workers did not put in an effort to ensure the victory of Mancha nominees in central and north Calcutta, one Mancha leader said at the meeting.

 Minister has a month to give in

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 17: Minister of state for cottage and small-scale industries Narayan Biswas has a month to surrender, or else his name will be deleted from the voters list.

 With the electoral roll revision starting on October 20, the election office has identified over 60,000 voters across the state who have warrants of arrest pending against them. The list includes the name of the minister, who is still absconding on police records. 

 That means the MLA from Gangarampur in South Dinajpur has till November 20 to prove to the district election authorities that he stays in his house and is not absconding.

 Earlier, Calcutta High Court had refused to grant him anticipatory bail in connection with a 17-year-old case of arson and looting.

 Biswas, however, claims that his bail plea is still pending before the high court and that he is not absconding. 

 Unless these people (identified by the election office) appear before the electoral registration officer, they will be issued showcause notices. They would then have to justify why their names shouldnt be struck off. The fact that the warrants havent been executed shows that the police havent found them living at the given addresses, said the outgoing state electoral officer, Basudeb Banerjee. 

 Officials at Writers Buildings, who requested anonymity, said the Election Commission is aware of Biswass case and has been monitoring it.

 The election office will also tip off the police so that they can nab the person in case he shows up.

 If Biswas fails to appear before the local electoral authorities and his name is taken off the rolls, he will not be able to contest the Assembly polls due next year.

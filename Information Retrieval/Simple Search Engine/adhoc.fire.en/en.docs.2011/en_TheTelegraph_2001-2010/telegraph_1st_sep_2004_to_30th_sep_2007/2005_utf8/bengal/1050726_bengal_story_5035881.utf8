 Another techie in vanish act

 - IT pro misled wife amp; flew to Bhubaneswar, say police

 Sandip and Sonali: What went wrong?

 Dankuni (Hooghly), July 25: Sandip Kumar Nag, the Manila-based software engineer who went missing on his way to his in-laws on Friday, is apparently in Bhubaneswar.

 In a throwback to the vanishing of Rajiv Bhattacharya ? the London-based IT expert ? Hooghly police said Nag, a technical consultant for Accenture in Philippines, had plotted his own disappearance and taken an Indian Airlines flight to the Orissa capital. 

 We found his name on the passengers list of flight IC 7542 that took off from Dum Dum at 3.20 pm on Sunday. He had booked the ticket (seat No. 13A) from a travel agent. We are in touch with our Orissa counterparts, said the Serampore subdivisional police officer, Bharat Lal Meena. 

 The police, however, have yet to trace the techie. 

 The motive behind the disappearance is yet to be estab-lished, Meena said. 

 Earlier, Bhattacharya, an IBM employee, had gone missing from Ultadanga a couple of days before his marriage. A day after, he was found at Mughalsarai railway station. The Salt Lake resident first claimed that he was abducted and then that he could not remember anything.

 The chief minister had said that he went on his own. The why is still a mystery.

 Nag, a mining engineer from BE College, Shibpur, was already married. 

 On July 22, he told his wife, Sonali, that he would leave for Calcutta by 9 in the morning to draw money from the RN Mukherjee Road branch of a private bank. At 1.10 in the afternoon, Sonali received a message from him asking her not to wait for lunch as he would be late. 

 At 2.27 pm, she received a second message in which Nag informed her that he got stuck in traffic. She then received the third and last message from him at 3 pm, which said that he had arrived at Dankuni ? about 20 km from Calcutta ? and was about to take a rickshaw to reach home in 15 minutes. Then there was no news of him, said Arijit Dasgupta, the officer-in-charge of Dankuni police station.

 Nag was in the travel agents office in central Calcutta when he wrote the last SMS to Sonali, the police said.

 Next day, his father-in- law Ramai Chandra Panja lodged a missing complaint with the local police. Today, Sonali and Panja came to Calcutta to speak to CID officers.

 Originally from Taldangra in Bankura, Nag married the girl from Dankuni early this year. After marriage, he left for Manila but came back in a week. He sought permission from his office to extend his stay in India to work out the modalities of his wifes visa. The company asked him to join its Mumbai branch, said an officer. Nag moved with his wife to Mumbai. The couple came to Nandankanan, Dankuni, from Delhi on July 19 to visit Sonalis parents.

 Nag apparently went to the travel agents office after withdrawing Rs 10,000 from the banks ATM. After spending the night in a hotel, he left the city next day

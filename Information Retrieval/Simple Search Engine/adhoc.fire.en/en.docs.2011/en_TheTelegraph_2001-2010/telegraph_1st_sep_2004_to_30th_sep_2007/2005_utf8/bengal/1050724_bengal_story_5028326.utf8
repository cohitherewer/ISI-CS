 Counselling relief for engineering students

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 23: A day after the state government announced its decision to hold recounselling of students for admission to engineering and technology courses, the joint entrance examination board today made it clear that it would be optional.

 Students who have already taken admission on the basis of the first round of counselling are not bound to attend the second round slated to begin on August 1, said officials.

 The re-counselling is optional, the coordinator of the boards central selection committee, Ajit Kumar Chattopadhyay, said this afternoon.

 Candidates holding state joint entrance examination ranks from 1 to 25,000 and those figuring between 1 and 27,000 in the All India Engineering Entrance Examination merit list have been given the option to attend the re-counselling for change of colleges and subjects, said the coordinator.

 The decision to hold the re-counselling was taken by the government after the All India Council for Technical Education restored most of the nearly 1,400 seats it had slashed in June in colleges that did not have infrastructure conforming to norms laid down for running engineering courses.

 Officials of the states higher education department said the re-counselling is also being conducted for the allotment of seats in some new private engineering colleges that are likely to start operating from the current academic session.

 Committee officials also said students who were unable to attend the first counselling held earlier this month will be allowed to attend the second round.

 Chattopadhyay said candidates belonging to Scheduled Tribes who held ranks between 1 and 323, Scheduled Caste students between 1 and 3966 and physically-handicapped candidates who ranked between 1 and 149 in the joint entrance merit lists for these students will be allowed to attend the recounselling.

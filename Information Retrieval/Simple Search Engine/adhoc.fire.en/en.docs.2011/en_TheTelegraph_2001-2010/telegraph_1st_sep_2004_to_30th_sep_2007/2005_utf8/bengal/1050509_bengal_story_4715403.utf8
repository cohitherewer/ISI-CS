 Mayors park versus intruders

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 8: The mayor roped in the defence minister to inaugurate Citizens Park opposite Rabindra Sadan this evening, which Mamata Banerjee thought would be hers to show off. 

 Before the rupture of her relationship with Subrata Mukherjee, that is.

 But Mamata did not sit idle. Within half-an-hour, she inaugurated another park ?Mohini Chaudhury Park in Behala ? that mayor Mukherjee thought would be his to flaunt. 

 An angry mayor later threatened to lodge an FIR against those who ?trespassed? into the CMC-owned park. 

 An exquisite patch of greenery with dancing musical fountains, Citizens Park gave the heart of Calcutta a reason to breathe easy. So did the Behala park for the residents of the area, though in a smaller way. 

 But Trinamuls Sovan Chatterjee, the member mayor-in-council (water supply), in Mamatas camp now, proved a show-stealer. 

 The self-proclaimed leader of Behala, Garden Reach and Jadavpur began projecting himself as Mamatas lieutenant in her battle against Subrata Mukherjee.

 ?The mayor has gone mad because he is now the mayor for only 10 councillors and is still shamelessly holding on to the chair at the helm of the 141-member CMC. If he has the guts, let him file FIRs against all those present here. We can file over a dozen such FIRs against him,? Chatterjee said. 

 Most of the 53 Trinamul councillors were present at Behala. 

 When Pranab Mukherjee threw Citizens Park open to public, there were MLAs Nirbed Roy and Tapas Roy, mayor-in-council members Mala Roy and Moinul Haque Chowdhury, Amiya Mukherjee and borough chairmen Ruby Datta and Dibyendu Biswas. 

 ?A process to recover the lost glory of Calcutta has started in the hands of Subrata Mukherjee,? said the state Congress chief, the mayor by his side. 

 At Behala, Mamata said: ?Trina means grass, which signifies spontaneous growth, and it cannot be suppressed. The development of the park is the result of the efforts of Trinamul councillors.?

 Reacting to the mayors FIR threat, she said: ?I have come here to inaugurate a piece of greenery and that doesnt require taking permission from anyone.?

 The mayor insisted that the park was the CMCs property and it had pumped in money for its facelift. ?If anything is to be done, it must be by the municipal commissioner. How can a borough chairman, Anjan Das, organise the inauguration of a park?? Mukherjee asked.

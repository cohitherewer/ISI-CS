 Death-data crunch hits disease map

 - Focus on rural areas, children

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 Calcutta, Jan. 15: Death registration ? or the lack of it ? is plaguing the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government. People in rural areas do not mind registering births because they are happy events, but feel there is no point registering deaths as there is often no immediate purpose that this would serve.

 The situation is worse when it comes to registering the deaths of infants, as no one wants to remember the deaths of children in their families.

 Though birth registration is nearly 100 per cent in the state, death registration is less than 60 per cent, according to the latest figures available.

 The government is, thus, losing out on valuable information. ?If the cause of deaths are not known, it is difficult to chalk out a disease map for the state,? said a senior official of the state health department.

 This is one of the problems being reviewed in an on-going series of meetings of health officials of the state. The meetings have been convened to pinpoint flaws in the process of registering births and deaths to help procure figures on time and chalk out a disease map in the state every year.

 ?We are meeting health officials of all districts and discussing with them the lacuna in the method and why the health department headquarters gets the data after such a long time,? said an official.

 The districts have been split into three groups. A meeting was held at Burdwan yesterday with officials of Burdwan, Bankura, Purulia, Birbhum, Nadia and Murshidabad.

 The next meeting, scheduled for January 18, will involve the north Bengal districts ? Malda, Uttar Dinajpur, Dakshin Dinajpur, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Darjeeling. On January 24, officials of Calcutta, Howrah, North 24-Parganas, South 24-Parganas, Hooghly, Purba Midnapore and Paschim Midnapore will meet in Howrah.

 The Burdwan meeting revealed that villagers are eager to register births as it is a happy event and they require certificates for school admission. However, they are not interested in registering deaths because of the lack of immediate benefits. The registration of the death of infants is the most neglected.

 It takes a long time for data on births and deaths to reach the health department headquarters from the panchayat, which needs to be more pro-active in passing on the information, the discussions showed.

 The officials felt that the exact cause of death must also be recorded. In most cases, the actual cause is not written in the correct format and it becomes difficult for the government to chalk out a clear disease map.

 ?The next two meetings will perhaps throw up the same issues and we will work out ways of improving registration of deaths,? said health management information system adviser A. Mukherjee.

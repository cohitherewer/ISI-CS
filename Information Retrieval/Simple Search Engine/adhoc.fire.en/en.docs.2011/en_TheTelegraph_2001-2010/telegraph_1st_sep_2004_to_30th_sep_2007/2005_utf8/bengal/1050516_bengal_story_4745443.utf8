 Bday bash for border cheer

 RABI BANERJEE

 Birthday cakes: Headed to a BSF camp?

 Krishnagar, May 15: There would be cakes and candles on birthdays for jawans manning the Bangladesh border in Nadia.

 Alarmed at the increasing number of suicides and violence among the guards, the BSF brass have decided to add a little cheer to their lives by celebrating their birthdays.

 On May 2, constable R.K. Sharma shot dead two colleagues before turning his service rifle on himself following a tiff over the arrest of a boy allegedly smuggling salt to Bangladesh via Lalgola in Murshidabad. 

 Subedar major Surjeet Singh, who was apparently suffering from depression and a neurological disorder, hanged himself in his room at Roshanbag in the same district the next day. The same day, a jawan shot a woman at Ghojadanga, North 24-Parganas.

 BSF officers in Nadia said four jawans have committed suicide over the past year. 

 R.C. Saxena, the BSF deputy inspector-general in the Krishnagar sector, said the trend was worrying. Being on constant alert along the border can cause extreme stress, he added.

 About 6,500 jawans guard the international border in Nadia. We want to help them relax and feel at home. So, we have decided to celebrate their birthdays. If our move turns out to be a success, birthdays of our jawans can be observed in other border districts as well, said the DIG.

 Inspector-general R.K. Panchananda approved of the plan mooted by the Nadia officers during a meeting he held after the Murshidabad incidents. He also asked the officers to be present at the birthday bashes to make the celebrations more meaningful. The IG told us that the system could also be introduced in other border districts, said Saxena.

 Many of the jawans posted in Nadia are from distant Jammu and Kashmir, Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh.

 An officer said a birthday roster would be drawn up shortly. We will organise parties in the respective battalions for each jawan, complete with cakes and candles. A budget will be drawn up and the birthday boy will be presented with gifts. There will be singing and dancing through the night, he added. The money will come from the welfare fund for jawans, said another officer.

 The force had also mulled celebrating marriage anniversaries. We toyed with the idea but then we unanimously decided that no other day can beat the birthday in a mans life, said Saxena.

 Officials said that an officer would soon be asked to draw up a list of the jawans birthdays.

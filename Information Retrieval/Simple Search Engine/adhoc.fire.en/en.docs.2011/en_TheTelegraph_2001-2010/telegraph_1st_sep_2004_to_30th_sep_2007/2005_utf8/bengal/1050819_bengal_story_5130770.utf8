 Fire engulfs godown

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 18: A massive fire engulfed a plastic and chemicals godown at Cossipore under Chitpur police station this evening.

 The fire broke out around 6.55 pm. We pressed 20 fire tenders into action, said G.K. Bhattacharya, deputy director, fire and emergency services.

 We were sitting on the roof of our godown when we heard an explosion. Immediately, flames started leaping up. We rushed to the chemicals godown but failed to enter it because of the heat and smoke, said Mahendra Singh, a worker at an adjacent godown.

 The fire was put out around 10.15 pm.

 One of the 160 firefighters pressed into action was injured. Atanu Pai fell from the first floor and has been taken to R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital, said Bhattacharya.

 The cause of the fire is unknown, Bhattacharya said. The extent of damage or financial loss is also not known.

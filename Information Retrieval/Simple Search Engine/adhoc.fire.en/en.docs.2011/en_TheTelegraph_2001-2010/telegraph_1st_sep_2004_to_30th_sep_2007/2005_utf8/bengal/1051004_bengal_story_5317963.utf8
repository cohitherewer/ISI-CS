 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Oct. 3: The Ramakrishna Mission Seva Pratishthan at Lansdowne is opening a college for women that will offer a four-year Bachelors degree course in nursing.

 Swami Gahananandaji Maharaj, president of the Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, will inaugurate Ma Sarada College of Nursing tomorrow.

 This will be the fourth ins-titution in the state where the course will be taught. Now, BSc (Honours) in nursing is taught at SSKM Hospital, Rabindra Nath Tagore International Institute for Cardiac Sciences and BM Birla Heart Research Centre.

 The secretary of the Seva Pratishthan, Swami Sarvalokananda, told a news conference: Medical sciences have advanced and the scope and techniques of nursing have also progressed rapidly. Advanced procedures and gadgets have led to a growing need for nurses with higher professional qualifications and skills. 

 In the first batch, 28 stud- ents have been admitted. The college will train the students in use of speed and skill in reacting to life-threatening situations and use of better management techniques. 

 The swami said there is a huge demand across India for skilled and qualified nurses from Bengal.

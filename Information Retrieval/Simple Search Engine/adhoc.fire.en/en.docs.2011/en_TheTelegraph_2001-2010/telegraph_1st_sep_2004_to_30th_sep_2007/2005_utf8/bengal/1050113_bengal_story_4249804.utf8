 BRIEFS

 Sagar Island, Jan. 12: The first day of the Ganga Sagar Mela saw a thinner attendance ? 24,000 ? than last year. ?A fear psychosis might have developed in the minds of the people after the December 26 tsunami and so people stayed away,? said district magistrate Vivek Kumar. 

 Last year, six lakh people had gathered at the mela. 

 Calcutta: Jyotirmoyee Sikdar, a CPM MP, has complained that she and her husband, Avtar Singh, were the targets of people who damaged the viewing mirror of her car at Nayapatti in Salt Lake. Police said it was broken after a quarrel with an auto driver.

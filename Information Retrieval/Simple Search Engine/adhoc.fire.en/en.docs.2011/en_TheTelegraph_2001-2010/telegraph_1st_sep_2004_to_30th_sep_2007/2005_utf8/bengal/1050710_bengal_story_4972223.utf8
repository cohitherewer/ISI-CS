 Love claim in boy death

 - Visva-Bharati school students body found near bicycle

 SOUMI BHATTACHARYA

 Moldanga (Birbhum), July 9: A student of Shiksha Satra, a co-educational high school under Visva-Bharati, was found dead under mysterious circumstances this morning, sparking claims and counter claims of suicide and murder.

 The body of Biplab Ghosh, 16, was found around 6.30 am beside his locked bicycle, with the key in his pocket, sandals neatly kept beside him and an empty container of antiseptic next to him, according to witnesses.

 There was a black mark stretching from the chin to the chest and the body lay with the arms and legs spread apart.

 The Class X student had left home yesterday around 2.30 pm, saying he was going to collect an exercise book from a friend.

 He asked for Rs 5 and I gave it to him. He left home immediately, but never returned, said mother Sarbani Ghosh, bursting into tears.

 Biplabs family members waited till 1 am and, finally, lodged a complaint with the Bolpur police station.

 Police rushed to the deserted place in Moldanga village, about 200 km from Calcutta, where the body was found and sniffer dog Rohan was brought in from Burdwan.

 Rohan smelt Biplabs lips and then sniffed around the bicycle and the container of antiseptic lying beside the boy.

 Biplab must have been killed and his body kept there. How could this be a suicide? asked the boys uncle Tamal Krishna Ghosh.

 Moreover, we suspect he was murdered because Biplab had been threatened by some students to leave the school. Perhaps his death is related to the threat, he said.

 Family members told police that a few days ago some classmates beat up Biplab and threatened him with dire consequences, asking him to leave the school as he was a meritorious student.

 However, police said Biplab was caught in a triangular love affair and might have ended his life out of frustration.

 We cannot come to a conclusion until the post mortem report comes. However, we believe Biplab was suffering from depression, said Nitya Gopal Choudhury, the Bolpur police station inspector-in-charge.

 We have gathered that he was in love with a classmate who rejected his love two days ago as she loves another boy, said the police officer.

 Biplab was an introvert boy. So we assume this triangle might have created a huge pressure on him and led to such an incident, said the police officer.

 Choudhury recounted that the friend to whom Biplab had gone said he shook hands but did not mention an exercise book. This indicates he was upset, said the officer.

 The death has shocked Biplabs classmates and teachers. This is very shocking, he was so well-behaved, said Swagato Sarkar, a classmate. He was a good boy, said Chandan Das, a teacher of the school.

 On receiving news of the death, the Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor, Sujit Basu, went to Baganpara in Simanto Palli to meet the family members.

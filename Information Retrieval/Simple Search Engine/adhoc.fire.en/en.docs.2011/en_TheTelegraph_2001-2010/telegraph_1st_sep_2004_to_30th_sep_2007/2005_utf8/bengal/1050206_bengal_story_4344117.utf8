 Onus on state to repair tram tracks 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Feb. 5: A special committee appointed by Calcutta High Court to monitor the progress of road repair across the city is expected to suggest that the government needs to concentrate on maintenance of tram tracks to improve the condition of roads. 

 The committee will place its report before a division bench of acting Chief Justice Altamas Kabir and Justice Asit Kumar Bishi on Tuesday when the case about the condition of city roads will come up for hearing again. It was last heard a month ago, when the committee was constituted. 

 The committee, of high court lawyers headed by Milan Bhattacharya, visited several roads last Saturday. They were shocked at the state of A.J.C. Bose Road, Elliot Road, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Street, a portion of A.P.C. Road, B.B. Ganguly Street, Lady Dufferin Road and Bhupen Bose Avenue. 

 ?All these roads have been damaged due to poor maintenance of the tram tracks. A few spots have really become death traps. An auto overturned in front of us on Elliot Road,? said Alok Ghosh, a committee member. 

 The panel holds that the government should immediately sanction sufficient funds for repairing the tracks. ?In some areas, the tracks have subsided and will have to be lifted to align it with the road surface,? Ghosh added. 

 Idris Ali, another committee member, echoed Ghosh. ?The state should pay immediate attention to the repair of damaged tram tracks,? he said. He said he would ask Bhattacharya to request the court to pass an order directing the government to disburse funds for developing the tram routes. 

 The court appointed the committee after the Calcutta Municipal Corporation told the court that development of city roads was impossible unless the tramways company repaired the tracks. 

 The Calcutta Tramways Company submitted that the tracks could not be repaired due to a lack of funds and said it had already sought Rs 53 crore for renovation of the tracks.

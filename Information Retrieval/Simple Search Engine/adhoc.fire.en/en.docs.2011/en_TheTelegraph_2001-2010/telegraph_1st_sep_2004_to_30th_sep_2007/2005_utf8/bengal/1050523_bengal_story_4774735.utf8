 CPM bleeds, cries foul

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 22: When most of Bengal voted in peace, blood spilled in Budge Budge. 

 A CPM worker was killed and three were seriously wounded when miscreants on motorcycles, said to be backed by the Congress, attacked a booth set up in a library at Charial, 30 km from here.

 Around 2.10 pm, 50 minutes before the close of polls, five youths rode into Bandhab Pathagar and jumped off their two-wheelers, bombs, rods and revolvers in hand.

 Seeing them, some CPM workers ran inside the booth and asked the policemen on duty to shut the doors, but the youths kicked them open and dragged the CPM workers to a courtyard. A thrashing began.

 About 200 panic-stricken voters, in the queue to exercise their franchise, fled to various corners of the library. Those who could left the premises.

 South 24-Parganas superintendent S.N. Gupta said the police tried to chase the miscreants away. When this attempt failed, one of the constables fired a round in the air.

 After that shot, the miscreants hurled bombs and fired indiscriminately. When they left, four CPM workers were lying in blood. Tarun Kotal, 34, died on way to SSKM Hospital, where Prasenjit Mal was admitted. Sujoy Roy was in M.R. Bangur Hospital and Sheikh Mintu in Batanagar Hospital. 

 The police said they suffered splinter injuries. The miscreants gunfire missed them.

 The CPM has called a 12-hour bandh in Budge Budge tomorrow. District party secretary Santimoy Bhattacharya alleged that Congresss anti-socials attacked partymen. Congress district secretary, Sailen Dasgupta denied the charge. 

 A duo has been arrested, said Gupta.

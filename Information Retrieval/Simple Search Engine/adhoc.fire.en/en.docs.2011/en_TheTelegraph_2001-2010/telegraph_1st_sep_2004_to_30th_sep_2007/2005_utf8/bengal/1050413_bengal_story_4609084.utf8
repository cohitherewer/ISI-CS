 Left list for city out, not agenda

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 12: The Left Front today announced its candidates for the June 19 elections to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, but said it will release its manifesto after conducting a ?micro-level? assessment of the Trinamul Congress civic body?s performance.

 Front chairman Biman Bose, who released the list, said its leaders will meet the people in all 141 wards to know their grievances before preparing the manifesto. Asked about the focal issues, Bose said: ?They will be finalised after the micro-level assessment.? 

 On a day its challenger took a step forward in its bid to wrest the crown, Trinamul appeared busy in its own skirmishes. At a meeting outside the corporation building, Mamata Banerjee refused to give credit to mayor Subrata Mukherjee for the civic body?s ?success?. 

 ?No individual is responsible for the success of the CMC run by our party. Whatever amenities we have managed to provide to the people is because of team work,? she said. 

 Mamata also made it clear there will be no seat adjustment with the Congress. ?The Congress and the CPM have joined hands to run the government in Delhi. Any understanding with them will tarnish our image and damage prospects.?

 Bose claimed that Trinamul was making ?tall claims? about ?performance? in the past five years. ?Attempts are being made to give an impression that all the flyovers and booster pumping stations were installed by the civic body.? 

 The front candidate for mayor, Bikash Bhattacharjee, will contest from ward 100. The CPM has fielded first-timer Shipra Raha in ward 87 where Subrata Mukherjee had contested the last time. 

 The number of women on the list is the highest ever ? 57. Kanti Ganguly and Sudhansu Sil were dropped because of their preoccupation as minister and MP respectively.

 Contract teachers stay

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 12: A division bench of the high court today passed an interim stay order on a trial bench verdict restraining the government from recruiting schoolteachers on contract.

 Todays order will allow the 18,000 para-teachers who have already been appointed to continue in service.

 The bench of Justices A.K. Ganguly and A.K. Bishi ordered the interim stay after being told by state lawyers that the government had through a gazette notification dated July 22, 2005, amended the rules regarding the appointment of para-teachers.

 Following the amendments, the salaries of para-teachers will be disbursed from funds allotted for the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan and appointment of permanent teachers in primary and secondary schools will not be affected, Rabilal Moitra, the government pleader, told the court.

 The government plans to recruit 73,000 para-teachers across the state. About 18,000 are already working. 

 Todays order is significant for thousands of educated unemployed youths, especially in rural Bengal, who were keen on a contract job in schools under the scheme. 

 Para-teachers in primary schools are paid Rs 1,000 a month, while those in secondary schools get Rs 2,000.

 In 2004, the Union human resource development ministry launched the literacy-for-all scheme to spread education among children aged between 5 and 14. With funds available under the central scheme, the state government decided to engage teachers on contract.

 Alma Khatun, who had sought the job of a para-teacher in a Nadia school, moved the high court this April after being refused. Soon after, 12 others petitioned the court from across Bengal challenging the legal validity of the contractual jobs.

 Justice K.J. Sengupta heard the petitions together and passed an order on May 13 saying that the appointments were illegal and ultra vires to the Constitution. 

 The judge observed that the governments move was against the Primary Teachers Appointments Act and the School Service Commissions Act.

 Justice Sengupta restrained the government from appointing para-teachers till the acts were amended.

 Teachers who had already been appointed on contract under the scheme were told to discontinue services. 

 Hundreds of such teachers then moved the division bench challenging Justice Senguptas order.

 The government pleader assured the court today para-teachers would be asked to take a limited number of classes and that there was no chance of their conflict with regular teachers.

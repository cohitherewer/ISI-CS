 UGC scanner on research

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, Jan. 17: The University Grants Commission has for the first time decided to monitor and evaluate research at varsities across Bengal and elsewhere in the country.

 The UGC exercise will be a continuous one, according to officials in the state?s higher education department.

 The decision has caused concern among state government officials following reports that the commission plans to use the initiative to fix the extent of financial assistance it should provide a university for research. The UGC?s financial assistance to varsities is likely to depend on the grading of research.

 The grants commission has set up a committee to decide whether the evaluation exercise can be implemented by March 31. The committee ? in which the Calcutta University pro vice-chancellor (academic), Suranjan Das ? is the only member from Bengal, met on Friday in Delhi to discuss the implementation.

 Das has welcomed the move, but has urged the UGC to ensure that the proposed exercise is not the only mechanism to judge the quality of research in a university.

 ?We welcome the UGC?s move to start the exercise of annual assessment of research activities carried out in the universities. But, it (the exercise) should not be used to determine the overall performance of an institution and tagged to providing of grants,? said the pro vice-chancellor.

 ?The output of an university is related to the input it gets, particularly in terms of financial assistance. The assistance provided to a well-known university in Delhi is far greater than the amount allotted to a university in a North Bengal district. Obviously, there will be a qualitative and quantitative difference in all respects, even in research activities,? he said.

 The pro vice-chancellor felt that number of citations submitted by the universities should not be the main criterion for judging their research quality, particularly in social sciences. ?Unlike in science and technology, where research papers are published in journals, many research works in subjects related to social sciences are published in the form of books. These publications should also be taken into consideration,? he said.

 However, a senior UGC official, when contacted in Delhi, said the universities need not worry. ?We are now working out the modalities of the exercise and are yet to decided whether issuing of grants to varsities will be affected if research performance is not found satisfactory,? he said.

 Higher education department officials said a handbook on research carried out in more than 400 UGC-registered universities in the country will be brought out every year. 

 ?If 500 research projects are undertaken in a particular subject in a year, the UGC will see how much has been conducted by which state. It would also find out how much was conducted in individual universities in the states,? said an official.

 Factory erupts after death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Feb. 21: Workers of a sponge iron factory here demanded Rs 12 lakh as compensation for the death of a colleague and gheraoed a manager for hours.

 Debdas Hazra, 36, was killed last night when an oxygen cylinder exploded in the factory.

 S. Mukherjee, the personnel manager, however, landed in trouble when he arrived at the subdivisional hospital to express condolence to the bereaved family members.

 Along with the compensation, the workers demanded a job for the next of kin of the dead. 

 Union leaders stepped into the ring in no time. Arobinda Nandy, the Intuc unit secretary, said the employees would not join work till both demands are met. The workers turned down Mukherjee?s offer of a job alone.

 Citu leaders of the unit, too, threw their weight behind the twin demands, staged a day-long demonstration and stalled production.

 Nabin Hazra, Debdas? elder brother, said: ?He was the sole earning member in our family. What will we do without my brother?? 

 ?I want both the cash and the job,? Nabin added. 

 The day?s work lost, the protests finally drew to a close with the management agreeing to pay damages. 

 An official said: ?Compensation will be provided according to norms.?

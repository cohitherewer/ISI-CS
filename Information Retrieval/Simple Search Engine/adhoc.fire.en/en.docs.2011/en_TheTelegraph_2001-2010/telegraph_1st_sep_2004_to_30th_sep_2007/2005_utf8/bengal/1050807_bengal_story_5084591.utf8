 Hill road block

 Siliguri, Aug. 6: A landslide 

 on National Highway-31(A) ? which links Siliguri to Kalimpong 

 and Gangtok ? last evening caused the first big traffic 

 disruption of the season, reports our correspondent.

 Vehicles on both sides were stranded as a 30-metre-high pile of rubble lay over a stretch of almost 100 metres near Sethijhora, about 8 km from Sevoke (Coronation) Bridge. The landslide occurred around 5.30 pm.

 Because of fresh landslides today, (traffic on) the road could not be restored, said Darjeeling district magistrate Ariz Aftab. If the weather remains fine, we expect the road to be cleared by tomorrow morning.

 Engineers at the spot said it would not be possible to restore traffic before noon tomorrow.

 Two bulldozers were brought in yesterday to clear the debris, but more rubble has been sliding down in the rain.

 Till the road is cleared, traffic from Siliguri will have to ply through Damdim, Malbazar and Lava to Kalimpong, and then through Renock to Gangtok. Another way is via Darjeeling. Both these routes would take between two and two-and-a-half hours longer than normal.

 While travellers caught in the jam returned to Siliguri to stay back for a night or took circuitous routes, truckers have pitched tents near the site of the landslide. Locals are trekking through the forests to reach the other side.

 I was on my way to Kalimpong on a project to study the local flora and fauna in the monsoon but I have been forced to return to Siliguri, said Animesh Basu, from Calcutta.

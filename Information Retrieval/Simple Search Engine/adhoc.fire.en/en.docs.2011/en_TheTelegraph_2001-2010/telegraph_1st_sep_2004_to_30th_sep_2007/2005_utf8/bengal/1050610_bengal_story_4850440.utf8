 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, June 9: The chief minister today said the city police will investigate the circumstances under which Rajiv Lahiri, the chief officer of the cargo ship MV Faiz, went missing. 

 Yesterday, the Centres mercantile marine department began probing the mysterious fire on the vessel. The states probe decision followed a petition from Lahiris family. As many of the sailors are from Calcutta, Bhattacharjee said, the police would find out what exactly happened on the night of May 30.

 Barasat: Priyanka Mondal, the HS examinee who was abducted on her way to school on Wednesday, was rescued on Thursday morning from a house at Bagda, North 24-Parganas, 80 km from Calcutta. The district police chief said Akhtar Mollah, a local criminal who whisked her away, is yet to be traced.

 Calcutta: Masked and gun-toting youths looted two houses at Noapara in Sonarpur early on Thursday. They beat up the family members, including women and children.

 Gas leak in city

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 29: A mob attacked the Manicktala police station on Thursday night after gas leaked from cylinders dumped near the police station.

 Local residents alleged that the police had not taken action although the cylinders had been there for nearly six months. Four fire engines were pressed into service and traffic was disrupted for some time.

 The situation was brought under control by deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division) V.K. Goel who reached the spot with a huge contingent.

 The divisional officer of West Bengal Fire Services, Bivash Guha, said: Some people complained of nausea and a burning sensation in their eyes. We dumped the cylinders in a canal and are keeping watch. But we could not identify the type of gas.

 In another incident, a truck carrying gas cylinders overturned on Central Avenue. The driver jumped out and is safe. Police said the truck was going to Khardah in North 24-Parganas.

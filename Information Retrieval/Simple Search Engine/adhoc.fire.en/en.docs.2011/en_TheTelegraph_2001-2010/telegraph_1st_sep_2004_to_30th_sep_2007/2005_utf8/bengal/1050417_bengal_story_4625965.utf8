 Firms under AIDS scanner

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 16: With the number of AIDS cases spiralling everyday, the state government has decided to focus on the corporate sector to spread awareness about the disease.

 ?With the disease taking menacing proportions and instructions on HIV and AIDS prevention not seriously taken by Calcuttans, especially in the corporate sector, we have decided to take the lead in explaining to people about the hazards of the disease,? says S.R. Das, the director of the State Productivity Council (SPC).

 On Monday, the council, along with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) ? represented by the State Labour Institute ? will kick off an orientation programme for corporate groups on HIV/AIDS prevention at workplaces in the city as well as in the districts.

 Several big firms like ITC, Webel, Castrol and East India Pharmaceuticals will be part of the campaign. ?We are trying to get as many people as possible for the programme, which will be attended by experts in this field,? said Das.

 The objective of the programme is to expand the AIDS prevention programme to workers and their families as well as provide social protection to help those affected cope with the disease. 

 The ILO has been making special efforts to prevent the spread of the disease and mitigate its impact in workplaces.

 Around 50. 51 lakh people in the 15-49 age group are estimated to be affected by the virus in India. ?Most of those who die of AIDS are adults in their productive and reproductive prime, with severe consequences on economic development,? states an ILO report. 

 The disease, till 2000, had affected over 36.1 million people around the world. According to ILO estimates, at least 23 million workers in the 15-49 age group are infected with HIV the world over, which is about three-quarters of all adults affected by the virus. 

 The loss of skilled people due to AIDS-related illnesses is causing serious decline in productivity. There can be a risk of infection, especially where workers have to stay away from homes for long periods ? for instance, transport, mining and defence services.

 The disease is changing the age and sex distribution among workers, raising the number of widows, orphans, and the elderly facing economic uncertainty.

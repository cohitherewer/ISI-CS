 Drama sets stage for Subhas row

 SANJAY MANDAL 

 Calcutta, Nov. 5: Four months after a clash over the Salt Lake civic body election, another showdown is shaping up between chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and transport minister Subhas Chakraborty.

 The issue this time is Chakrabortys attempt to have an old, celebrated play re-enacted as part of a week-long drama festival on the Hooghly.

 The state government today dealt a blow to Chakrabortys plans by refusing him permission to hold the festival on the Hooghly on security grounds.

 Chakraborty wants to stage a six-day performance of Kallol, a drama by the late playwright Utpal Dutt, from next Monday.

 The show was to be organised by the Utpal Dutt Natyotsab Committee to celebrate 60 years of naval mutiny against the British, but Chakraborty, an influential leader of the CPMs North 24-Parganas district, took the initiative and adopted the festival.

 Representatives from the government met Subhasbabu at his Salt Lake residence and informed him of the administrations position on his proposal, CPM officials told The Telegraph.

 The decision is based on the assessment of police and other agencies concerned that the seating arrangement for the audience, who would include former chief minister Jyoti Basu, on old stationary barges was unsafe. 

 Subhasbabu is upset at the denial of permission, but he is resolved to carry out his plans, a source said.

 Chakraborty was not available for comment, and telephone messages left at his residence were not returned. He does not want to talk about it, one of his aides said.

 According to party officials, Chakraborty exploded when the governments decision, framed at the behest of the chief minister who also oversees police and cultural affairs, was conveyed to him.

 I am not going to accept it like this, a source quoted Chakraborty as telling his followers. The governments so-called decision springs out of someones hidden agenda. 

 After the denial of permission, Chakraborty is determined to stage the festival as planned, his supporters said, though it was not clear how the state CPM leadership, busy now with preparations for Mondays protest at Kalaikunda against the Indo-US joint air exercise, would react.

 The state leaderships reaction depends on the support Chakraborty can hope to muster from his own North 24-Parganas CPM unit.

 Subhasda is shocked as well as frustrated because he has been planning to have Jyoti Basu present at the concluding show. Now he has vowed to make the event a big success, a CPM official said.

 The decision to refuse permission could affect the truce between a section of the partys North 24-Parganas unit and the state leadership. 

 During the Salt Lake civic body elections last June, the feud came out in the open with Chakraborty and Dum Dum MP Amitava Nandi criticising the state government for police atrocities.

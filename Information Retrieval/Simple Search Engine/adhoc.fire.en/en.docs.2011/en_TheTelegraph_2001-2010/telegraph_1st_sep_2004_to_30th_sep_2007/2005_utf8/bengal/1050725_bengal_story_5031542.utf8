 Land grab derails housing for poor 

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE

 Durgapur, July 24: A housing project for the poor has failed to take off in Durgapur, Asansol and Ranigunj because of encroachers, who are occupying the land and enjoying free water and power hooked from overhead wires.

 The Centre-sponsored Balmiki Ambedkar Abasan Yojna is already delayed by nine months. Officials of the Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority, which owns the properties, fear that Delhi might soon seek an explanation. 

 But despite the threat to the Rs 16-crore project, the authority is against any move to evict the 2,500-odd families occupying about 100 acres.

 We are worried. The Centre may seek a progress report any time, said a senior official of the authority. But he ruled out any drastic action.

 The housing project was taken up about one-and-a-half years ago, but the civic authorities failed to evict the families, some of who have been living there for the past three decades and allegedly form a chunk of the CPMs vote bank.

 Two thousand single-storey houses consisting of a bedroom, a kitchen and a toilet were supposed to be built as part of the project. They would have cost Rs 40,000 each and the Centre would have provided half the amount. The beneficiaries would have had to pay the rest in four instalments.

 Officials said the authority and the civic bodies of Durgapur, Asansol and Ranigunj had found about 2,000 families from among the encroachers eligible for the scheme. 

 But even the families selected for the subsidised housing do not want to move. They are enjoying the prime land and water supply from roadside taps free. Most of the electricity is hooked. So, why will they opt for the housing where they will have to pay Rs 20,000 and bear other subsequent establishment costs like for power? asked Rathin Roy, the Durgapur mayor, a CPM leader.

 This encroachment is a big problem for us but we want to handle it carefully. We will conduct door-to-door campaigns and try to convince them that the project will ensure better living, Roy said.

 Asked if the go-slow was a result of the encroachers voting preference, Roy said: Who told you? There are supporters of various parties among the illegal settlers. And added in the same breath: It is a fact that most of them are our supporters, but whats wrong in it? That also does not mean that we will allow them to stay. Our government, too, does not encourage encroachment.

 Asansol mayor Tapas Roy, also of the CPM, said the civic body had earlier evicted hawkers to widen roads. We will also evict the encroachers. But now we are trying to convince them about the benefits of the housing plan. The CPM mayor of Ranigunj, Runu Dutta, too, said an eviction drive would be launched, if necessary. 

 None of them said when the housing project was likely to be launched.

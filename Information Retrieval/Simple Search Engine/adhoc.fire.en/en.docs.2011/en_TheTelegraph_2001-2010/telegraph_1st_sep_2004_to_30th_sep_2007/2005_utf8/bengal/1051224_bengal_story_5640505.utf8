 BRIEFS

 Guskara (Birbhum), Dec. 23: A primary school and a college here have been closed down for three days because of a CPM farmers wing convention to be held on an adjacent field.

 The college, about 130 km from Calcutta, had been asked to suspend classes between December 22 and 26. The local CPM unit will use the classrooms to house delegates. This is the longest Christmas vacation in the 50 years of our college, said the principal, Swapan Pal.

 Behrampore: Gunjan Gourav, a 30-year-old from Bihar missing for the past five days, was found unconscious off National Highway 34 in Farakka. Police said his hands and legs were tied up.

 Krishnagar: Unable to bear the humiliation of being harassed by people from whom her husband had borrowed money, Rekha Biswas set herself afire on Friday. Her children, aged four and six, were playing outside the house in Kalyani when Rekha, 25, committed suicide. Her husband Mritunjoy, who has run a debt of about Rs 2 lakh, left home two weeks ago.

 Kalyani: The Bidhan Chandra Agricultural University here will hold the first farm fair (krishimela) in Bengal. About 2,000 farmers from Bihar, Orissa, Jharkhand and Bengal will participate in it, vice-chancellor Dipak Bagchi said. The four-day event will begin on January 30.

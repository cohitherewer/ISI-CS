 HS fracas amp; fraud

 March 24: On HS Day II, a teacher allegedly beat up a student for refusing to submit his answer script in Alipurduar leading to a free-for-all and a youth was handed over to police for impersonating an examinee in Balurghat.

 Ashim Chakrabarty, the headmaster of Gobinda High School in Alipurduar, apparently slapped Tapas Goswami and snatched his English, paper II, answer script 10 minutes before the scheduled close of the examination. 

 Goswami, a student of Alipurduar Boys High School, was handed to the police. The trouble broke out when his friends saw him being taken to the police station. An agitated group of students converged on the school as another examinee, Gobinda Biswas, also claimed to have been slapped by a teacher. A mob began to pelt stones at the school from outside the campus and one of the candidates, Kanchan Kumar Roy, was hit in the head. 

 Kanchan needed a couple of stitches. The boys? school headmaster, Santanu Dutta, got Goswami released from the police. 

 Goswami alleged: ?The headmaster snatched my answer script well before time, he began beating me and then handed me to the police.? Chakrabarty said the student abused him after refusing to hand over the answer script. ?I took him to the police to prevent the situation from going out of hand.?

 In Balurghat?s Khadimpur High School, examinees complained to headmaster Bimal Das that another boy was writing the English first paper instead of Netai Pal of Lalitmohan High School. Centre-in-charge Parimal Chakrabarty said later the impersonator managed to give them the slip.

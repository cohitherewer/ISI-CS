 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 6: Opportunities 

 are raining this summer at the Vinod Gupta School of Management 

 at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. 

 And if the summer placements at the 11-year-old school of management are any indication ? and they definitely are a fair indication ? the final placements are worth looking forward to.

 The best of India Inc. and some global majors, including ITC, Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, HSBC, DSP Merrill Lynch, IBM, Nestle and Caterpillar, trooped into Kharagpur to pick the B-brains. 

 The placements involve summer and dissertation projects for six months. 

 ?We are delighted at the excellent response from the various companies that have offered summer training programmes to all our 85 students,? said Gautam Sinha, in-charge of training and placement at IIT Kharagpur. 

 The largest recruiter was the fast-moving consumer goods giant ITC, which picked up 15 students ? a record among the country?s management institutes, according to the school?s officials ? for six-month stints. 

 In the field of finance, ABN Amro, Deutsche Bank, DSP Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, IDBI, HSBC, Reserve Bank of India and Standard Chartered Bank are leading the pack of head-hunters.

 Marketing assignments were offered by Marico, Nestle, Rallis India and Bajaj Auto, among others.

 Other recruiters include IBM, Hewlett-Packard, HCL Tech, e-Serve, Systsoft and Skytech, Caterpillar, Ashok Leyland, TAFE, Tata Motors, Tata Steel and Tata Chemicals. 

 According to tradition, four students have been selected for projects at InfoUSA, the company owned by Vinod Gupta at Omaha, Nebraska, in the US. 

 They will also enrol for courses at the University of Nebraska and Creighton University along with working on projects.

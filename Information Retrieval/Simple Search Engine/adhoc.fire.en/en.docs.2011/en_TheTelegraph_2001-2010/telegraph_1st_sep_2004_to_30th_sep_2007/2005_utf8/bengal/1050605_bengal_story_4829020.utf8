 NCP-Cong rift

 Calcutta, June 4: The United Democratic Alliance faced a hurdle with Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party deciding not to withdraw its nominees in nine wards where the Congress has already put up candidates for the June 19 civic body elections, reports our special correspondent.

 The Congress does not believe in coalition politics. That is why the party had offered us only two seats out of 141. Are we beggars, to be offered only leftovers? asked state NCP president Bikram Sarkar.

 The NCP leader was also irked at his party not being included in the manifesto committee and said a letter was sent to state Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee two days ago expressing our grievance.

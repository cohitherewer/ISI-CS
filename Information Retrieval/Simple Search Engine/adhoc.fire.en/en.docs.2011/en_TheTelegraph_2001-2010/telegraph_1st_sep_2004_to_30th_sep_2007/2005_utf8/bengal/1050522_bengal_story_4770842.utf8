 Job racket busted

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 21: The enforcement branch has arrested one person from Sonarpur on the southern fringe of the city on the charge of duping people by promising jobs overseas.

 Avijit Das, is the co-owner of Global Welfare Consultancy, which would promise clients from Khardah, Madhyamgram and Burdwan jobs across parts of England, the US, Canada and Australia against payments ranging between Rs 70,000 and Rs 90,000.

 Das was taken into custody by a team of officers late last night from the firms office in Sonarpur. The other co-owner, Ashok Roy, escaped.

 We have been receiving complaints from different persons across parts of south Bengal that this firm was taking them for a ride after collecting money, said the additional director-general of police, Bhupinder Singh.

 The last one was from Sonarpur. Probing the complaints, the enforcement branch found there were several irregularities in the functioning of this consultancy firm, he said.

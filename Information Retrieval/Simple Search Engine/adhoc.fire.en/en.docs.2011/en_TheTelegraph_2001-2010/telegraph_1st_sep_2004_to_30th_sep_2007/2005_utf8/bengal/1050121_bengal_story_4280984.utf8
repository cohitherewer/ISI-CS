 Anil takes on govt baiter

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 20: State CPM secretary Anil Biswas today suggested that if agriculture minister Kamal Guha is really opposed to the government?s way of functioning, he should quit. 

 Yesterday, the Forward Bloc leader slammed the government in Burdwan. It is exploiting and terrorising people, he reportedly told a party conference. Guha had criticised Writers? Buildings earlier as well. 

 Biswas said: ?I don?t know what Kamalbabu will do after such harsh criticism. But I can tell you that I would have first resigned from the government before criticising it.?

 ?Functioning as a minister and criticising the government cannot go simultaneously. I don?t even know what his party (the Bloc) will advise him after seeing such remarks about the government and what Guha will do now,? Biswas told reporters at the CPM headquarters on Alimuddin Street this evening.

 Yesterday, Guha also criticised CPM leaders ? Biswas, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen ? and alleged that the ?exploitation of the poor is much more severe in the Left regime? than during the previous Congress government.

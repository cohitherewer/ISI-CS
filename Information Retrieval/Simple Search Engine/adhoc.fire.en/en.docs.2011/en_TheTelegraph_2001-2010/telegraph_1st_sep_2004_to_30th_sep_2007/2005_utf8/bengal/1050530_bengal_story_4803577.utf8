 Police set up schools in rebel region

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, May 29: Police in West Midnapore have struck upon a unique way to beat the Naxalite menace. They are arming villagers with education. 

 The villagers in these areas are simple and uneducated. So it is very easy for the CPI (Maoist) activists and moneylenders to influence and cheat them.... People have to be made conscious and given basic education. This is what we are intending to impart, said Ajay Kumar Nanda, superintendent of police. 

 The police have set up half-a-dozen centres to teach residents of the Naxalite-infested villages in the district ? most of them are tribals. 

 Nanda and additional superintendent of police Sumit Chaturvedi inaugurated centres at Bangbuta, Shimulpal, Burijhor, Kankrajhor, Banspahari and Dangardiha yesterday,

 Sheltered by mud walls and tin roofs, the centres ? each costing Rs 5,000 ? have been constructed with money from the polices security-related fund. 

 There are arrangements for electricity and drinking water and students will be given books, pens, pencils and other stationery. 

 The target students are those going to pre-primary school and adults who have never been to a classroom. The centres will remain open almost the entire day, keeping in mind the convenience of students of such varied age-groups. Gradually, we will open more such schools, Nanda said. 

 Sinha chalked out a chart for the classes. We have decided that coaching would be offered to students of primary schools in the morning, pre-primary students can study when schools are on, women can be taught in the late afternoon and the aged might study in the evening.

 Giram Hembrom of Bangbuta village said: I have never been to school. My brother studied up to Class IV in a village 4 km away from our house. Now our village has a primary school, where my son will be admitted next year. However, before that, my son and I will study in this centre.

 Bimal Mahato of Banspahari village describes the move as a blessing for a number of people in our village who dont know how to read or write.

 Maoists feel that teachers at these centres will act as police informers. We think an ulterior motive is behind opening these teaching centres. The teachers will get a chance to interact with villagers and get information about CPI(Maoist) hideouts, said a sympathiser of the outfit.

 The rebels have even threatened to blow up the Bangbuta centre. 

 The police, however, are undeterred. Though the police have set up the centres, it actually belongs to the common people. And the people will protect them, Nanda said. 

 If these centres can be made popular and necessary for people, then the Maoists will be afraid to destroy them, another official said.

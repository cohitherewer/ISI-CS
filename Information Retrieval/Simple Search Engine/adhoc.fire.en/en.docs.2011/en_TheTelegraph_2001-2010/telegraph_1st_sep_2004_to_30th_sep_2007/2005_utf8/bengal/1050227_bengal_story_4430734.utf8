 Schoolteacher held for ear-splitting blow

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 26: Ashok Chopra, a teacher of a central Calcutta school, was arrested today for allegedly slapping a Class XI student to partial deafness.

 Nilesh Marwari, a student of Chopra?s school on Sukesh Chandra Street, said he was chatting with friends in a classroom during a free period when the teacher accused him of creating disturbance. When Nilesh tried to protest, Chopra slapped him. 

 The student, who claimed he did nothing that could disturb another class, said he was hit so hard on his right ear that he slumped to the floor. When he reached home ? aided by some friends ? with bruise marks on his ear, his parents proceeded to the school.

 ?Sensing trouble, Chopra immediately apologised,? said an officer of Hare Street police station, where Nilesh?s parents later lodged a complaint.

 ?We examined him (Nilesh) and found bruise marks. He complained of having hearing problems,? said the officer. The police picked up the teacher from the school.

 Echoing Nilesh, his parents said their son was beaten without any provocation. ?There were five or six of Nilesh?s friends in the room... They were talking without making a commotion. We cannot understand what made Chopra angry,? they told the police. 

 ?It was mentioned in the complaint that the student developed hearing problems after being slapped by the teacher. We asked Nilesh?s parents to submit medical reports given by the doctor who treated him to know the extent of the injury,? said Vijay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, central division.

 Chopra, who is doing his MPhil in mathematics, was produced in the chief metropolitan magistrate?s court and granted bail.

 During interrogation, he told the police that he did not realise he had hit Nilesh so hard. However, Chopra also said he wanted to punish him for creating a commotion. ?I never thought it would take such an ugly turn,? the teacher told the officers.

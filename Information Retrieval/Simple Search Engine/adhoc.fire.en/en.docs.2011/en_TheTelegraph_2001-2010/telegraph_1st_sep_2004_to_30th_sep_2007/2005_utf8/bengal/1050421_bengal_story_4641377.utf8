 Subrata replays tie-up tune

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 20: Undeterred by the suspension of two Trinamul Party MLAs for advocating a seat-sharing deal with the state Congress, mayor Subrata Mukherjee today reiterated the need for an anti-Left alliance.

 The Trinamul leadership made it clear that the party would not have any truck with the Congress, which heads a government at the Centre with the CPM?s support. 

 But Mukherjee refused to budge from his stand. ?I do believe that only an alliance with the Congress can help us defeat the Marxists in the ensuing civic and municipal polls. If articulating this basic political exigency amounts to an anti-party act, then I am ready to face the consequences,? he said this afternoon.

 The mayor added that he would not allow the CPM to wrest the civic board from the Trinamul. 

 Trinamul sources said Mukherjee has lined up a meeting on Friday with Paras Dutta and Nirbed Roy, who were shown the door yesterday, to discuss the future course of action. Those in favour of an alliance have been asked to attend.

 Mukherjee?s comments sparked cries of protest from Trinamul leaders. ?We are keeping a close watch on the developments and will react at an appropriate time,? said Subrata Bakshi, the party?s state president. 

 He added that the leadership would shortly convene a meeting to discuss the party?s poll strategy.

 Dutta and Roy said their suspension order did not specify their anti-party activities. ?We are still in the dark on what ground we have been placed under suspension. What are our anti-party activities?? asked Dutta. 

 He also complained that the leadership did not offer him any scope to explain his conduct. ?Even? Dhananjoy Chatterjee was allowed to defend himself before being hanged for murdering and raping a schoolgirl. Are we worse than Chatterjee??

 Roy rued that there is no democracy in the Trinamul. ?It is unfortunate that our party is being run on somebody?s will and whims. There is neither any policy nor any set principle.?

 Nayana Banerjee, another MLA who had faced the axe earlier, said tonight that she is yet to receive her suspension order. 

 She had earned the wrath of the leadership by campaigning for her husband Sudip Banerjee, who had contested the last Lok Sabha elections as a Congress-backed Independent candidate.

 Bid to calm Great Eastern 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, March 2: Afraid 

 regular demonstrations by agitating employees would choke 

 the trickle of guests to Great Eastern Hotel, tourism minister 

 Dinesh Dakua has lined a meeting with them next week. 

 He hopes to persuade the employees of the state-run century-old hotel to accept the Early Retirement Scheme offered a week ago to about 400 employees, including 60 contract workers. Last month, the government decided to shut shop as part of its move to privatise the ailing hotel. 

 ?Hotel employees lay a virtual siege to the hotel these days by regularly demonstrating at odd hours since the notice was served on February 25 asking them to opt for the scheme and inform us within 30 days. Demonstrations by staff have sent a wrong signal to tourists whose number has come down to 15 per cent,? said Jagannath Bag, member secretary and chief executive of the hotel. 

 Bag said some Citu members had accosted him yesterday demanding that tourism secretary T.K. Burman, also chairman of the hotel, should meet them. ?Now the minister would shortly meet them to address their problem,? he added. 

 Dakua will have his job cut out as two leading hotel employees? union, affiliated to bitter rivals Citu and Mamata Banerjee?s Trinamul Congress, today joined forces for a united movement against the retirement scheme. 

 ?Calamity is a mighty leveller and we should all be united at this juncture to stall the government?s scheme,? Trinamul leader Sovandeb Chattopadhyay told Citu representatives at a meeting. 

 ?Since it is a matter of life and death for all hotel employees, we can oppose the government?s move tooth and nail under the banner of a common platform,? replied Citu member Ashish Roy.

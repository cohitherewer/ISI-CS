 Rebel buzz keeps govt on toes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 15: Intelligence Branch (IB) officers have apparently informed the Bengal government that two top-level Maoists from Nepal, who are explosives experts, have sneaked into the state and are hiding in the forests of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore with other members of the organisation.

 The rebels had recently blown up a police camp under construction at Bandwan in Purulia and killed a CPM branch committee member in Nadia.

 Officials at Writers Buildings said chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb would visit the trouble-torn districts in the wake of intelligence reports that the extremists might strike again. The spurt in Maoist activities also figured in this weeks conference of directors-general of police held in Delhi.

 An IB officer said the duo from Nepal is training local Maoists to handle explosives. They are being told about the latest devices. We have seen that the Maoists style of triggering explosions changes fast.

 In West Midnapore, the administration has introduced bicycle patrolling to develop a good relationship with villagers, besides keeping track of the rebels. If we can earn the villagers confidence, the battle against the extremists will be half won, police officials said. 

 Now the policemen are searching the jungles leaving behind their cycles in the villages. That we can do so proves that we are gaining the local peoples trust, said an officer of West Midnapore district.

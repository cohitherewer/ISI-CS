 HS paper leak replay

 OUR BUREAU

 March 23: The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education today cancelled biology, paper I, a day after reports reached of a ?leak? at an examination centre in a repeat of last year?s incident.

 Council president Gopa Dutta announced the decision taken at a meeting hurriedly convened during the day after it came to light that about a dozen girl students at the Lalpur Mahatma Gandhi College exam centre in Purulia, 250 km from Calcutta, were given the biology paper instead of the Bengali paper.

 In 2004, an identical incident had occurred at an examination centre in Chanchol, Malda, where biology, paper I, was distributed instead of Bengali, paper I, prompting the paper?s cancellation.

 The biology examination this year, however, will take place as scheduled on April 13, Dutta said and added ?there is no need for the candidates to panic?. A new set of papers will be given to the students taking the Higher Secondary examination.

 ?This time, two key officials, who were in charge of the centre, were responsible for the premature and wrong distribution of the biology, 1st paper, among a few students,? Dutta said.

 The council has despatched two officials from Calcutta to replace Biplab Ghosh, the centre-in-charge and Annada Prosad Mondal, the centre secretary, and conduct a probe.

 Ghosh had collected all the biology papers after realising the mistake and lodged an official complaint at Hura police station.

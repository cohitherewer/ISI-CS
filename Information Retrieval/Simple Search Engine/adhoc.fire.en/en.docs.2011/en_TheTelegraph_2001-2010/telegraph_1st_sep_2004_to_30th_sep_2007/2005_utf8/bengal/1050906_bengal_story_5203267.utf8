 Asim winner in cabinet skirmish

 OUR BUREAU

 Molla (top) and Dasgupta: 

 Winner takes all

 Calcutta Sept. 5: A week 

 after he was virtually mauled by Abdur Rezzak Molla over 

 a remark regarding a real est-ate venture on a government 

 plot, Asim Dasgupta scored a point by setting the stage 

 for a restructuring of the plan almost his own way. 

 Thanks to the chief minister, we have been able to peacefully sort out our differences, the finance minister said, with Molla looking on, in the chief ministers chamber. 

 Minutes before that Bha-ttacharjee had left Writers Buildings for lunch, after presiding over the ministers kiss-and-make-up session that lasted nearly two hours. 

 Dasgupta told the media in Mollas presence that as he had proposed earlier, the government would entrust the public works department with the responsibility of constructing a multi-storeyed circuit house and seek fresh bids for building a commercial-cum-residential complex on the 58-acre Bedi Bhavan premises.

 A circuit house in the city is an absolute necessity. Many of our visitors now have to be put up in expensive hotels for want of government accommodation, Dasgupta said. It would be built on a portion of the land by the PWD. The remaining land would be leased out by the land department. We intend to complete the process at the earliest. 

 The finance minister apparently cited technical hitches and played on the chief minister and the CPM brasss anxieties about getting embroiled in a real estate-related row in the run-up to next years Assembly elections to get what he wanted.

 I wont comment on whether the procedure followed so far would stand cancelled or if it was flawed. All I can say is that the land department can float tenders a second time. Whoever offers the highest would get the deal. 

 Dasguptas efforts were primarily aimed at getting the circuit house out of the scope of the original (now almost sure to be cancelled) Rs 15 crore-Bedi Bhavan project and built by the PWD next to the commercial-cum-residential complex.

 The idea evoked support from the chief minister, who had backed Molla in the August 30 cabinet meeting and ensured that Dasgupta withdrew his remark that the Bedi Bhavan project at 5 South End Park off Gol Park, as planned by Mollas department, lacked transparency. 

 But the moment the chief minister agreed to the idea of the PWD constructing the circuit house with Rs 8 crore to be released by Dasguptas department, Molla had no option but to cancel plans to get the main complex built by a private builder, Fort Group. 

 It had offered the best price for the land ? Rs 18 crore ? and agreed to build the circuit house worth Rs 2 crore.

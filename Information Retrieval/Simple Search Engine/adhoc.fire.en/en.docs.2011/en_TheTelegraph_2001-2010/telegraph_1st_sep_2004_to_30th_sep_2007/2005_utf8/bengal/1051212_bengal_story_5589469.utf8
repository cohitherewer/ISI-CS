 CM targets cop nexus

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, Dec. 11: A section of policemen is in league with anti-socials and political leaders, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said here today.

 This is a dangerous trend and the government wont tolerate such irresponsible behaviour from the disciplined force, he said. Policemen have to tackle crime and corruption impartially.

 Bhattacharjee was speaking at the open session of the three-day state conference of the West Bengal Non-Gazetted Police Karmachari Samiti at Madhyamgram on the citys northern fringes.

 The chief minister called upon the police to arrest criminals without bothering about their political affiliations. Your job is to get anti-socials arrested. They cannot thrive if you are active enough to take on them, he said. 

 Bhattacharjee advised policemen to unearth corruption even if it exists in the department. If you find corruption even among your superiors, your duty is to raise voice against it and make it public. Dont bow to any pressure.

 He asked them to be more responsible in their day-to-day performance.

 You should also stand by the people in distress. Dont forget that your job does not end with merely picking up criminals and filing chargesheets. Help those who are in trouble, the chief minister added. During the night, you are the government and help those who are helpless.

 Expressing concern over the recent spurt in white-collar crimes, the chief minister said more politicians are getting involved in financial scams these days. So you have to be vigilant against those involved in such crimes. Dont compromise with anybody and get the offenders punished, whoever he may be, he added.

 The chief minister conceded that housing problem among lower-level policemen is acute and it has to be addressed on a war footing. I have appointed an officer of the West Bengal Housing Board to exclusively oversee the housing problems of policemen, he said.

 He said around 4,000 personnel will be recruited to the force in the coming days.

 The chief minister also criticised the neighbouring Jharkhand government for not extending help to tackle Maoists.

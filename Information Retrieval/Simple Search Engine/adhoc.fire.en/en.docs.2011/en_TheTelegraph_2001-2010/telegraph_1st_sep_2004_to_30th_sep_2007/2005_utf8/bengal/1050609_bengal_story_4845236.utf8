 Faiz probe gets rolling

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 8: The probe into the fire on MV Faiz got underway today, but hopes of a breakthrough may have sunk with the ship.

 The fact that the ship has sunk has made our task extremely difficult, as vital evidence ... is, perhaps, at the bottom of the sea now, said a senior official of the the shipping ministrys Mercantile Marine Department (MMD), which is carrying out the investigation.

 At the moment, we are recording statements of the sailors and trying to find out whether there are any discrepancies in them, he added.

 After an initial inquiry, the department will send its report to the office of the director-general of shipping in Mumbai for further probe.

 Pervez Rehman, the owner of MV Faiz, said he had sent two vessels ? MV Atif and MV Soleman ? to try and pull out the cargo ship, but the line snapped. The water was rough and with no engines (they were destroyed in the blaze), it easily overturned, he said.

 The shipping authorities, however, have refused to buy Rehmans version as word spread today that all the cargo on Faiz ? 800 tonnes of pulses ? was reloaded into other vessels and whisked away to other parts of the country. 

 On the night of May 30, a fire engulfed MV Faiz, gutting the engine room and the accommodation rooms completely. The captain of the ship, P. P. Shelly, his wife Smitha and children Lubin and Nidha were charred to death.

 Rehman had demanded that a manslaughter case be filed against the deck officer and nine crew members who escaped, leaving the captain and his family to die.

 The case of the missing chief officer, Rajiv Lahiri, is also shrouded in mystery. Different people seem to have said different things about the circumstances leading to Lahiris supposed plunge into the sea, said an MMD official.

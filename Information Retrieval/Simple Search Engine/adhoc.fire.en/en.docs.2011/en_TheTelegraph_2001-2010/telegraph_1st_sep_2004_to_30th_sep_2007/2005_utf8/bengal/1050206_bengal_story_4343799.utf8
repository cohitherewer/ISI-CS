 Teacher meet halts class

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 5: School education minister Kanti Biswas today publicly rapped the CPM-controlled government school teachers? body for organising a three-day conference on the campus of the Ballygunge Government School by suspending classes.

 ?Many guardians contacted me and complained that academic activities should not have been suspended for two days for holding the conference. This should not happen in future,? the minister cautioned the organisers of the conference being held from today at the south Calcutta school where classes have been suspended till Monday.

 ?I have never seen classes being suspended in this way in any government-run school to enable teachers to organise their annual conference,? said Biswas, the chief guest at the 27th annual conference of the West Bengal Government School Teachers? Association.

 Biswas sought an explanation from Bisnu Roy, the general secretary of the organisation, on why they had not taken the guardians? opinion before deciding on the venue.

 ?I have been told by the organisers that arrangements have been made by teachers to hold extra classes next week to compensate the loss of classes caused by the closure of the school on Saturday and Monday. This should have been conveyed to the guardians.?

 Biswas? observation left members of the association red faced as they did not expect him to tick them off in a such a manner. The embarrassment among the participants was evident when the minister began his speech, rapping the organisers.

 Roy, apparently stung by the minister?s rebuff, promised the teachers would hold additional classes to compensate the loss. He also assured Biswas that they would not organise any meeting in future at the cost of students.

 The minister was reportedly perturbed because this came on top of a section of education department employees allowing ? two months ago ? a private organisation to hold a fair inside the government-run Hare School.

 In his 20-minute speech, Biswas repeatedly reminded those present on the ?significant role? of the teaching community in the modern system of education.

 Biswas pointed out that the Left Front government had enhanced the pay scales and other financial benefits of teachers and that the government expected quality teaching from them. ?Teachers and government employees account for only 0.75 per cent of the population in Bengal. But our government spends 33 per cent of its total annual budget on salaries,? the minister said.

 ?Can we not expect more devotion from teachers?? asked Biswas. ?No other state government in the country spends so much on teachers? salaries.?

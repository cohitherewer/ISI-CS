 Boom town eyes empty plots

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE

 Durgapur June 13: Riding the crest of a steel boom and an industry turnaround, Durgapur has become hot for property hunters. But plots there arent many and, if you have one and are still waiting to finalise your plans, beware. 

 The Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority has set its sights on residential and commercial plots that remain unutilised years after they were bought.

 We will not allow residential and commercial plots to lie unused for three years or longer. We will take back plots from those who took them on lease from us and left them like that. These lands will be distributed among the applicants through lottery, said Narayan Swarup Nigam, the chief executive officer of the authority.

 Over the past two years, the authority has received over 2,000 applications for residential plots from local people, those in the neighbouring districts, Calcutta, Bihar, Jharkhand and as far away as Delhi.

 Officials said most applicants sought plots near the heart of the town, the City Centre and the Bidhannagar area, about 200 km from Calcutta. 

 For the residential and commercial plots that were given out on a 999-year lease, the authority has already started a survey. Already over 35 plots ? measuring around 100 cottah ? have been identified in various parts of Durgapur. 

 We will buy them back. However, a 5 per cent administrative charge will be deducted, said Nigam. The authority has yet to decide the buyback price. 

 About five years ago, the authority had distributed the plots on condition that houses will be constructed in five years. Later, the limit was brought down to three years. Industrial land cannot be left vacant and unutilised for more than two years, an official said. 

 It had earlier decided to take away land from entrepreneurs who had left vast tracts unutilised. Officials said the process to take back industrial plots has already begun. A land bank for investors willing to set up units in the Asansol-Durgapur region would be created with the plots reacquired.

 Dilip Chatterjee, who had taken a 2.5-cottah residential plot at Sagarbhanga three-and-a-half years ago, said he could not build a house because he did not have the money. Now I am told that it will be taken back, he said. 

 The twin cities of Durgapur and Asansol are being developed under the National Urban Renewal Mission. The authority is in talks with Durgapur Steel Plant (DSP) for the purchase of their unused land. 

 We have already bought an acre at Rs 1 crore from the DSP for a medical city near the township, said Nigam. 

 Calcutta is now just about three hours away after the widening of National Highway 2, Nigam said. And that has catalysed growth. With an upgraded ambience with modern lifestyle facilities, and the void in healthcare filled by the medical city, Durgapur and Asansol should embrace the surge of development.

 Finally, funds to better track record

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 2: The government has finalised plans to repair tram tracks on six major arterial roads in the city at an estimated cost of Rs 5 crore.

 Besides, Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC), which is responsible for repair and maintenance of the tracks, has undertaken patchwork repair on five other roads. 

 The government had formed a four-member expert panel headed by PWD engineer-in-chief S.P. Roy to identify tracks that needed immediate repair, sort out technicalities and monitor the work. The others in the quartet were the chief engineers of the CTC, the CMDA and the transport department.

 Earlier, Calcutta High Court had formed a committee of five advocates to identify the roads in disrepair and bring it to the notice of the authorities concerned ? the municipal corporation, the public works department, the CMDA and the CTC.

 ?The expert committee has prepared the list of tram tracks to be repaired and we have finalised almost all formalities. We expect to begin work in a fortnight with a target to complete within August 31,? CTC managing director S.N. Pal said today. 

 Minor repair (patchwork) of tracks on six roads is in progress and would be completed in a fortnight, he added. 

 ?We will award contracts to several contractors instead of one to ensure quick completion of work,? said Pal. 

 CTC officials made it clear that the repair work on the six major roads would be confined to the damaged portions. ?It would have been better had the entire road been repaired, but it is not possible to do so with the meagre budget. We are trying to repair as much as possible,? the MD said, adding that at least Rs 53 crore was required to fill up all the craters.

 A tug-of-war between the transport department and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has been on for months over who will repair the tracks. Though the corporation is responsible for the repair and maintenance of roads in the city, mayor Subrata Mukherjee had made it clear that the civic body would not repair any road with tram tracks.

 The CTC, on the other hand, had expressed inability to undertake any major repair citing financial crunch. However, prodded by the high court, the government stepped in. 

 Hearing a public interest litigation, the court had expressed concern about the condition of roads and asked the relevant agencies to take up repair work. In response, the government allotted Rs 5 crore for repairs and another 50 lakh.

 Members of the two committees have visited Kidderpore, Mominpore, Hazra, Lansdowne and Tollygunge to assess the progress of work on the tracks and roads. The advocates have also urged the experts to include tracks on Judges Court Road for repair near Hazra crossing, Viharilal College and Alipore Central Jail.

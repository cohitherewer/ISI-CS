 Death after village verdict

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, June 26: Residents of a Nadia village lynched two young men last night after a local shalishi board allegedly indicted them for stealing crops and farm machinery two days ago.

 Police said those involved in the twin murders at Patharghata village, about 140 km from Calcutta, are absconding. Raids are being conducted across the district and elsewhere in search of six youths who killed the duo, additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh said.

 He, however, added that it was a matter of investigation whether the village body had pronounced them guilty. But preliminary investigation suggests that some villagers killed them out of anger.

 Ganesh Ghosh and Bablu Ghosh, both middle-aged and residents of Sutia village in Chapra, had allegedly stolen two pump sets, a few bags of jute crops and some money on Friday night from some farmers of Patharghata. 

 The next day, instead of going to the police, the robbed villagers approached village elders, who formed the shalishi (conciliation) board. 

 Deputy superintendent of police Prafulla Saha said he was not aware of the existence of any such board. We are probing the case and it is difficult to say who were actually involved, he added.

 Samsul Islam Mollah, the CPM legislator from Chapra, said the duo was killed as a section of villagers wanted to avenge the thefts. The villagers were agitated as Ganesh and Bablu were accused of stealing crops from other villages earlier. The police failed to arrest them.

 However, he condemned the killing and sought the arrest of those involved.

 The additional superintendent said one Gutu Mondal and his five associates hacked the duo to death. Villagers informed us that two mutilated bodies were lying on a field near a pump house. We came to know the probable reason for the brutal murders questioning some of the villagers, he said.

 Gutu apparently called out Ganesh and Bablu on the pretext of going to a soiree last evening. As Gutu was a close friend, I did not protest. He also told us that they would return home late, said Bablus father Ananda.

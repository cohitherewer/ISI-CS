 Clinic cloud after arrests

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Jan. 18: In the early 1960s, the Chatterjees of Ketugram, about 240 km from Calcutta, donated two acres to the district authorities for a primary health centre. 

 A member of the same family is now behind bars for alleged ?theft, trespassing and making indecent gestures? towards an employee of the clinic that came up in 1965.

 The timing of Sanjib Chatterjee?s arrest and the nature of charges, however, have left the family fuming.

 Only recently, Sanjib and cousin Prasenjit wrote to the district?s chief medical officer pointing out the mismanagement of Sitahati Primary Health Centre and accusing Mousumi Mondal of occupying three employees? quarters and running a poultry from there. The duo also held the block medical officer responsible for the mess that the lone clinic in 35 km had turned out to be.

 Police were prompt to act on an FIR lodged by Sanjay Bhattacharya, the Ketugram block medical officer, on the basis of Mousumi?s complaint. Sanjib and Sanat were arrested last Thursday. Prasenjit escaped for not being at home.

 Mousumi, who accused the youths of stealing wood from her poultry and making gestures, said: ?Whatever I have done, I have done with the health department?s permission.? She could not explain how she balanced duty and business. 

 Residents testified that little was in order at the health centre. An elderly villager said the health centre started with a doctor, a pharmacist and a nurse. In 1982, a residential complex was built for its employees and a water pump installed. ?Now a doctor visits the health centre only once a week. The health centre employees are nowhere to be seen. Even if some one breaks a hand or leg, he has to be taken to the Katwa Subdivisional Hospital, about 100 km from here.?

 Sanjib and Prasenjit had sought chief medical officer?s intervention to stem the rot. The officer, Santosh Kumar Sarengi, said he has drawn the health department?s attention to the condition of the health centre. Asked about the complaint against the Chatterjees, he said he has sought a report on the alleged incident.

 Prasenjit?s father Pranabesh is convinced that they are being victimised for drawing the authorities? attention to the wrong end. ?We have written to the health minister,? said Pranabesh. 

 Benoy Das, a villager, summed up the plight: ?We cannot depend on the health centre. Travelling to Katwa is often the most feasible alternative.?

 Clinic for Digha tourists

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Dec. 6: The state general hospital in Digha will now have a clinic exclusively for tourists.

 The East Midnapore health authorities promised it would operate round the clock with doctors working on shifts.

 Drowning in the sea is frequent among tourists here. In many cases, where the victims are rescued immediately, we feel they can be revived if we are equipped with the expertise for removing the water and sand from the lungs at the earliest, said district chief medical officer of health Subrata Dutta.

 Tourists are also often injured when flung against boulders during high tide or suffer heart attacks while bathing. We will equip our clinic with equipment to meet such emergencies and for trauma care. We will also have health workers trained in resuscitating techniques, Dutta said. 

 Till August, seven tourists had drowned in the sea at Digha. Over a lakh tourists visit Digha every month. 

 Last year, eight tourists were killed in accidents on roads leading to the seaside town. The district authorities said the trauma care unit will be of immense help for the survivors of such crashes.

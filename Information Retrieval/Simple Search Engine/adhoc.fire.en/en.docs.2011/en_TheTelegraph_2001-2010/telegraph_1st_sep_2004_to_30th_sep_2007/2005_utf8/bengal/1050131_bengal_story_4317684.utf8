 Toy train chugs to takeover 

 ANURADHA SHARMA LAKHOTIA

 Heritage on wheels 

 Siliguri, Jan. 30: The historic Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR), almost crippled by mounting losses, is on the verge of being handed over to RITES, a public sector unit under the ministry of railways. 

 A team from RITES, which offers transport-related consultancy, was in the region a fortnight ago to prepare a feasibility report on the takeover of the world heritage site and inspect mechanical and technical aspects, including the condition of the tracks and coaches. 

 ?At the behest of the railways, we have conducted a survey on the feasibility of the proposed plan and are now in the process of compiling the final report,? P.D. Sharma, the RITES general manager, told over phone from Gurgaon. 

 ?In the next 15 days, we will be in a position to present it before the railway board for a final clearance,? said Sharma. The railways have ?verbally? expressed eagerness to hand over operations of the colonial-era train, he added.

 The takeover, if it happens, will be first instance of Indian Railways ? the largest public sector organisation in the world ? handing over management and operations of a section of its train services to a separate undertaking.

 The narrow-gauge train, chugging since 1880, has been struggling to cope with losses worth about Rs 9 crore a year. 

 In November 2003, the Northeast Frontier Railway, which has been running the train for over a century, slashed chartering rates from Rs 1,29,136 to Rs 24,000. The marketing of chartered rides, too, was handed to the Indian Rail Catering and Tourism Corporation. 

 The move paid dividends, but they were not enough to revive the railway?s fortunes. 

 Sharma said the DHR holds immense potential to earn revenue, but has to be packaged and marketed better. 

 ?Our study shows around 20,000 foreign tourists visit north Bengal and Sikkim every year, but only a small fraction takes a ride on the toy train. There is a huge market waiting to be tapped. An aggressive promotional drive will help boost the DHR?s fortunes.?

 RITES now runs the 800-km Mozambique Railway network. Sharma said: ?We took over the operations and maintenance of Mozambique Railways last November.?

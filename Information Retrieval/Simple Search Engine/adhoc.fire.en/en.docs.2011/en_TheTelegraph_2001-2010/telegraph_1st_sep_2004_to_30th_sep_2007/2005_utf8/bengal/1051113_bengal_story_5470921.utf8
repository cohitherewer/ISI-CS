 Cable blackout

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Calcutta, Nov. 12: After the decoder diktat comes the switch-off circular.

 Yesterday, sports and youth affairs minister Subhas Chakraborty had issued a letter to broadcasters asking for signal to be provided to a multi-system operator (MSO) looking to start operations soon. Today, STAR India, one of the top broadcasters in the country, issued a public signal switch-off notice against Indian Cable Net, the biggest arm of SitiCable.

 The notice informs customers of the MSO ? around 30 per cent of the 18 lakh cable and satellite homes in the CMDA area ? that the STAR channels will be disconnected on the network after one month on account of non-payment of outstanding dues.

 The blackout could affect viewers around town, from Salt Lake and Paikpara to Ballygunge and Garia. 

 Though STAR officials refused to divulge the outstanding amount, market sources pegged it at Rs 1.6 crore.

 Indian Cable Net ? bought over from RPG Enterprises by the Zee-backed SitiCable in May ? lobbed the ball into the operators court. STAR has been asking us to collect payment from operators for the 7 per cent increase in subscription as well as for its second bouquet of channels, said a spokesperson for Indian Cable Net. That will result in a hike of Rs 35-40 at the consumers end, which operators are not willing to accept.

 Cable watchdog Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had raised the ceiling on subscription charges by 7 per cent a while back. Also, according to a Trai mandate, broadcasters are required to issue a public notice one month prior to switching off any network.

 STAR offers its channels in two bouquets to cable operators. The first one comprises channels such as STAR Plus, STAR Movies and National Geographic Channel while the second package, introduced recently, includes STAR One, Hungama and the two Disney channels.

 Shock deaths at Sealdah

 Calcutta, Feb. 19: Two youths were killed at Sealdah station this afternoon when they were electrocuted by an overhead wire. 

 A railway official said the youths were rushing to board a Budge Budge-bound local train scheduled to leave platform 13 in the south section at 4:30 pm when an iron rod that they were carrying came in contact with the wire.

 They were rushed to NRS Medical College and Hospital, where they died. The youths, aged 22 and 25, are yet to be identified, said the official. 

 Railway authorities shut down the overhead power supply of all south section platforms from 4.33 pm. 

 At all platforms but No. 13, the supply was restored at 4:48. Ten trains were delayed by 10 minutes because of the switch-off.

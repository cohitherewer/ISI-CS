 Body found in RG Kar backyard

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, July 9: The body of a 30-year-old security guard was found on the premises of RG Kar Medical College and Hospital this morning with injury marks on his head and arms. 

 Vinod Chaudhurys legs were fractured and his hands were scarred, suggesting he had been dragged down a cement slab.

 This is the first time in recent months that a hospital worker has died unnaturally on its premises.

 Around 8 am, one of the attendants spotted Chaudhurys corpse lying next to a garbage dump at the backyard of the colleges gynaecology building. 

 The attendant was standing on the first-floor balcony of the building, from where she raised an alarm.

 Tala police station was informed immediately and an unnatural death case was registered. 

 Forensic experts were called as well. The body has been sent for post-mortem to ascertain the exact nature of the injuries.

 Primarily, going by the injury marks, it appears the victim could have fallen from a height. But the chances of murder cannot be ruled out. We are waiting for the post-mortem report, said Barun Kumar Mullick, the deputy commissioner of police (north).

 A member of a private agency that provides personnel to the hospital on a contract basis, Chaudhury was on duty till 9 last night, when his replacement arrived. 

 His colleagues said Chaudhury had told them that he was going home in Koila Patty near the hospital. But we knew he would go and drink for sometime before heading home. That was his daily routine, said one of the ward boys who was on morning shift with Chaudhury a week ago.

 Police say Chaudhury did not return home yesterday, but it is not clear where he spent the night. 

 Preliminary investigations reveal that he could not have fallen from one of the balconies of the gynaecology ward as all of them are covered with wire mesh.

 What is most confusing is how did the body of someone, who left for his home after duty, surface behind the building that is separated from outside by a high boundary wall? Obviously, the victim either went there on his own or could have been brought by others, said Pradip Mitra, the medical superintendent of the hospital. 

 He, however, added that despite all efforts, it is difficult to ensure that outsiders do not slip into the hospital compound without a valid night card.

 The buzz among the hospital staff is that Chaudhury was locked in a dispute over money with a group that calls the shots on the deployment of private staff. 

 The hospital administration has decided to revamp the security ring on the campus. 

 We have written to the supervisors of a private agency handling security on the campus to pull up their socks. This is very serious because everyday, we are dealing with at least 700-800 students and around 1,200 patients, said Utpal Dutta, the principal of the hospital.

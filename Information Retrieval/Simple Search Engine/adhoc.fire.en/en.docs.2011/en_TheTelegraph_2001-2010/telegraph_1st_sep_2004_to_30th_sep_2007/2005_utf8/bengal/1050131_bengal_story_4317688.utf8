 Friend turns foe over liquor

 Calcutta, Jan. 30: The Forward Bloc, which is part of the government, has lined up a statewide ?movement? opposing Writers? Buildings? decision to issue licences for new liquor shops. 

 Ashok Ghosh, the state secretary of the Left Front partner, said: ?Opening of liquor shops smacks of decadent culture. That is why we will picket in front of liquor shops across the state for a month and pressure the government to revoke its decision.? 

 He added that the ?minor front partners were not consulted? before the ?anti-people measure? was taken to increase revenue earnings. 

 The Bloc leader said it is ?unjust? to collect revenue by opening new liquor outlets. ?It?s true that the government has been going through a severe financial crisis. But we are opposed to opening of a large number of liquor shops, which will harm our youths and even students.? 

 Bloc general secretary Debabrata Biswas said the party will organise a rally at Sahid Minar on Wednesday. ?We are shocked to learn that the government allows one liquor shop for every 18,000 people. This will tarnish the Left Front?s image,? said Biswas.

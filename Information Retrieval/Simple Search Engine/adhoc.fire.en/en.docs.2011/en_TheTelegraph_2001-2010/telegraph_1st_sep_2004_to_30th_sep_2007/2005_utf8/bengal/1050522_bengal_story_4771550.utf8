 Old age home for tigers

 SANJAY MANDAL

 AT Peace

 Calcutta, May 21: The Royal Bengal tigers of the Sunderbans need not worry about growing old anymore. 

 With the states first tiger rescue centre set to come up at Jharkhali in South 24-Parganas, those of the big cats unable to catch prey in old age can now find a peaceful haven amidst their natural surroundings.

 We have drawn plans for the tiger rescue centre and they are being finalised, R. K. Tripathi, principal secretary, state forest department, said today. It will be set up under the Project Tiger scheme.

 At the rescue centre, tourists thronging the Sunderbans will also be able to spot tigers more easily.

 Forest officials said today that a 45-hectare plot has been identified to set up the rescue centre. This land originally belonged to the forest department but was later handed over to the land and land revenue department, a forest official said.

 At a high-level meeting earlier this week at Writers Buildings, it was decided that part of the land would be returned to the forest department to set up the rescue centre.

 It will have a freshwater pond, mangroves and species like deer for the tigers to prey on. When a tiger grows old, it is unable to catch prey and often develops a tendency to enter villages to hunt cattle and even attacks human beings, said a forest official.

 According to Sunderban Tiger Reserve field director Pradeep Vyas, there are also other reasons for a tiger to stray into areas with human habitation.

 A mother tiger in search of food for her cubs may also stray into villages.

 In the last one year, there have been 14 cases of tigers straying into villages. All of them returned safely to the forest, Vyas said. In three cases, the tigers were captured and released in the forest. 

 Two tigers raided the villages again and one was caught by forest officials and brought to Alipore Zoo. It has been named Sunderkanta by the forest minister. It was the last tiger we had from the Sunderbans, said S. K. Chowdhury, the zoos director.

 Dues fiasco stuns hospital

 DEBASISH CHATTOPADHYAY

 Calcutta, March 8: Nearly 68 hours after the death of constable Amrita Lal Ghosh in a private hospital, his family finally got possession of the body. But not before his relatives obtained a loan of Rs 1.5 lakh at a whopping 36 per cent interest and paid a portion of the outstanding bills.

 Authorities at the Calcutta Medical Research Institute (CMRI) refused to allow them to take the body as they failed to pay bills over Rs 2.6 lakh.

 ?This was the second such case in a few days, where a patient?s relatives, who promised to pay the hospital bills during admission, went back on the terms and conditions at a later date. This cannot go on,? said Amit De, the chief executive officer of CMRI Hospitals.

 Last Thursday, armed goons arrived in three taxis at the same hospital, roughed up employees and took the body of a teenage girl without clearing bills worth over Rs 2.5 lakh. ?We tried to explain the situation to them. But they simply wouldn?t listen?? De added.

 The Ghoshs ordeal came weeks after the chief minister said the state would ensure that no member of the police force suffers from lack of treatment because of a crunch. 

 Ghosh, 45, who was posted at Behala, suffered a heart attack and then slipped into a coma. He was undergoing treatment at Vidyasagar Hospital, but some of his colleagues got him shifted to CMRI on February 23. In 10 days, the charges amounted to Rs 2.68 lakh.

 ?When we could not muster the funds, we went to the police station. The OC tried, but could generate only Rs 7,000,? said Ghosh?s daughter Sonali.

 After he died on March 5, the family said they could not pay. The hospital finally had to waive Rs 1.18 lakh of the dues.

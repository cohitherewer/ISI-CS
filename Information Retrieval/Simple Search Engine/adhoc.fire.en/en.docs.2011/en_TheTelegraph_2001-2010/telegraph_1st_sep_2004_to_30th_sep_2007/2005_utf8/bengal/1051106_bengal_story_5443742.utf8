 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Nov. 5: A 25-year-old youth, Guddu, sneaked into the enclosure where white tigers are kept at the Alipore Zoo and started pulling the tail of a tiger. 

 The guards posted near the cage managed to force the youth to leave the area. In 2000, a tiger had mauled a youth who entered its cage. He later died in hospital.

 Howrah: A 65-year-old man was hospitalised after he was beaten up for protesting against bursting of crackers. Police said Rabin Dutta had lodged a complaint alleging that some youths were bursting crackers near his house. His wife Sabita, a heart patient, could not bear the sounds, he said. After police arrested one Prakash Das, his associates raided Duttas house and beat him up.

 Durgapur: Train services in the Burdwan-Asansol line were disrupted following the appearance of three wild elephants in the Andal railway yard. The Coalfield Express, Shatabdi Express, Black Diamond Express and the Rajdhani Express were held up at the Panagarh, Galsi and Andal stations for about half an hour, officials said. The elephants crossed the Damodar River and entered the railway yard from the jungles of Mejia in Bankura district, 230 km from Calcutta.

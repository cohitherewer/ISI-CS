 Tiger alarm at Writers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 1: The ghost of dwindling tiger counts has visited Writers Buildings.

 Alarmed at reports of rampant poaching in Sariska and several other reserves, the chief minister, also the chairman of the state wildlife board, has called a meeting tomorrow with forest department officials on conservation of the big cats in Bengal.

 The situation in Bengal is not as bad as in the rest of India. However, we are concerned over conservation in future, forest minister Jogesh Burman said.

 According to official figures, tiger population in Bengal has remained stable over the past five years. The December 2001 census reported 300-odd tigers in the state, with 271 in the Sunderbans and 31 in Buxa tiger reserve in Jalpaiguri. The figures of the January 2004 census also hovered around 300. Of this, 274 tigers were reported present in the Sunderbans and 27 at Buxa. 

 However, there have been reports of poaching from Buxa and tiger sighting has become rare. Many tigers from Buxa have also reportedly moved over to Bhutan in the wake of militant activities. 

 The minister said he would raise the issue of shortage of forest staff and guards. There are 2,500 sanctioned posts for forest guards, but only 1,500 are manned now. Recruitment is frozen.

 Joint management of the Sunderbans with Bangladesh is also a problem, said an official. Coordination with the neighbouring country is far from satisfactory.

 Another cause for concern is the dolomite factories in Bhutan which, officials said, pollute the rivers downstream. The official said dolomite mining units in north Bengal have been closed down.

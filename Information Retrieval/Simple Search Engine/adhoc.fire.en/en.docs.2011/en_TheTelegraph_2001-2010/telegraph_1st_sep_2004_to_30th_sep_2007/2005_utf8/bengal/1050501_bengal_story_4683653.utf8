 Airport alert puts cops on toes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 30: Security at the airport was beefed up today after an alert was sounded by intelligence agencies.

 An indefinite ban on entry of visitors to the airport has been imposed since Thursday night as authorities apprehended terrorist attacks following the death sentences awarded to Aftab Ansari and six others in the American Center attack case.

 Police have set up three special checkpoints at the approaches to Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport. 

 ?This is being done to closely scrutinise the vehicles entering the airport,? said Vageesh Mishra, inspector-general, South Bengal range. 

 The police are working in close co-ordination with the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which is in charge inside the airport. 

 ?We will review the security situation after a couple of days and decide on whether to continue the ban,? said Sanjay Prakash, CISF commandant.

 Passengers, too, are being checked with greater care. ?We are using more manpower to guard various points at the airport,? Prakash said. 

 Officials said vehicles are not being allowed to be parked in front of the airport terminal building. ?We are not taking any chances,? a senior airport official said.

 Police stations across the city also continued to be on alert against possible attacks by Ansari?s accomplices. A message from Lalbazar on Thursday had asked the officers-in-charge of all 47 police stations to step up vigil. 

 State police officials said they are in touch with central intelligence agencies. 

 Security has been tightened around Writers? Buildings. All gates are being manned by personnel of the Radio Flying Squad, who are frisking employees and visitors. 

 The security blanket has been stretched to Metro Railway and Howrah and Sealdah stations, where plainclothes policemen have been deployed. 

 The police in neighbouring states have also been alerted. ?We have contacted senior officers in Bihar and Jharkhand,? said an official, adding that most of Ansari?s gang members had used hideouts in these two states before the American Center attack, in which five policemen were killed.

 The districts bordering Bangladesh have been asked to be on their toes. ?The Indo-Bangladesh border is considered the safest corridor by terrorists. We are also sharing information with the Border Security Force,? said an official of the state intelligence branch.

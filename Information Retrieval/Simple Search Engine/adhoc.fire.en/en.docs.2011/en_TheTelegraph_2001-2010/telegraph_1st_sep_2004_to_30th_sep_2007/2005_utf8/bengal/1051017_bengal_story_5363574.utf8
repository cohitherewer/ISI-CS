 BRIEFS

 Midnapore, Oct. 16: Purnendu Sengupta, the CPI legislator from Midnapore, died at his home in Tamluk this afternoon. He was 71.

 He developed a breathing problem in the afternoon and passed away soon after. Sengupta is survived by his wife, son and daughter. He had been an MLA from the constituency since 1996.

 Suri: Paresh Nath Paramanik, 37, a jeweller, was found hanging from the boundary wall of his house at Nalhati on Sunday. Iron rods protruding out of it had pierced into his throat and come out of an eye. Paramanik was alone at home, 280 km from Calcutta, on Saturday as his wife Rupali and daughters were out of station. Police were clueless about whether it was suicide or murder.

 Durgapur: A day after Mobile Baba chopped off the arm of a youth at Telipara, the local CPM unit asked villagers, 170 km from Calcutta, to avoid priests and tantriks.

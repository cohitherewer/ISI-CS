 Malda, May 8: Indrajit, all of 15 months old, changed hands for a fistful of rice, a piece of turmeric, a couple of coins ? one made of copper and the other a 25 paise ? and the hope of a better future.

 Born into a family that struggled to make ends meet in the Bidhannagar area of this town ? Mira works as a domestic help and Sukumar Mondal pulls a rickshaw for a living ? the child, the couple said, was the son ?they craved for but could not keep?.

 ?I have three daughters between seven and 13 years and my son has been unwell since he was born. It was impossible to buy medicines for him and provide for everyone else at the same time,? Mira said.

 ?My husband and I earn around Rs 100 between us each day. At least now I can watch my son grow up. He may not have lived had we not given him away,? she added.

 Residents of the shanty town, located under Godhrail bridge close to Rabindra Bhavan, said the barter had taken place last week in the presence of the whole neighbourhood.

 ?The couple who took the child, Bimal and Swapna Ghosh, are the Mondals neighbour,? one of the residents said.

 No one in the locality seemed opposed to the barter.

 Most said Mira had done the right thing because she could not provide for medicines on one hand and food on the other for the ailing baby.

 Ranu Mondal, one of the residents, said Indrajit had been doing well and now looks healthier than he did a week ago. ?If the baby was left with his parents, no one knows what would have happened to him,? she said.

 Bimal Ghosh was attending to his two daughters who had been admitted to the district hospital after a bus rammed into their home, located off NH 34, last Wednesday.

 Bimal, who sells milk and paneer for a living, said: ?We are not very well off, but because I have bought the boy, I will try and raise him to the best of my ability.?

 Swapna, who has been to school, said her first child was a boy, but he died soon after birth. She said: ?I am not worried about the extra expense we will have to incur. Had my first child been alive, he would have been 18.? 

 Indrajits natural parents sometimes took him to their house and she had no objection to that. ?His parents had to spend Rs 300 every fortnight for medicines, and then there was the extra cost of food for the baby. Then, one day, Mira told me she wanted to sell her son,? Swapna said.

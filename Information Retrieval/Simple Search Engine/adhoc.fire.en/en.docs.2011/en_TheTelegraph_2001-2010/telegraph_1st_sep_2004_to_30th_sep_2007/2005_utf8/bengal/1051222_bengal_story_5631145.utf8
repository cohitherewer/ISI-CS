 Caged deer dies after park shift

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Hijli, Dec. 21: A spotted deer died and five others fell sick after they were brought from an animal rescue centre in Jhargram for release in a new park in West Midnapore.

 The deer were transported in a van for about 70 km on bumpy roads for the inauguration of an animal park and rescue centre in Hijli, about 130 km from Calcutta.

 Though the animals were to be released at the park by forest minister Jogesh Burman, officials let out the five sick deer this morning after a pregnant deer died.

 Burman, who arrived here today, said: The deer are very weak-hearted. A few days ago, three out of 36 died while they were being shifted.

 Forest officials decided to bring in half-a-dozen spotted deer, including four pregnant ones, so that the park at Hijli had several of them. We caught six deer from about 110 in the rescue centre in Jhargram. We had kept the deer overnight in separate cages to ensure their safety, said an official.

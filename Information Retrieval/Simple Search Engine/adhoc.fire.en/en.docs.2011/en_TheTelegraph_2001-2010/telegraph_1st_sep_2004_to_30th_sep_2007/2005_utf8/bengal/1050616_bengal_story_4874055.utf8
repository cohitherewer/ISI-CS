 CPM chants unity mantra

 - Dum dum strategy for salt lake

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 15: The CPM is gearing up to do a Dum Dum in Salt Lake.

 According to sources, politburo member Jyoti Basu has told the North 24-Parganas leadership that like in the Lok Sabha polls in Dum Dum, the Subhas Chakraborty and Amitabha Nandy factions must fight together to ensure a clear majority. 

 Jyotibabu has told all the leaders to ensure that there is no factional battle this time, a party leader said.

 The CPM has asked district workers to ensure that the victory margin against the faction-ridden Trinamul Congress does not go below eight in the 23-seat Bidnannagar municipality. Our target is to win 19 seats. However, it should not be less than 15, a party leader said.

 In the last civic board, elections to which were held in 2000, the CPM had a slender majority of one seat over Mamata Banerjees party. 

 We are confident that the number of seats will increase considerably this time, said Amitabha Basu, the partys North 24-Parganas secretary. 

 The peg of the CPMs campaign is our achievements in the last 10 years, when Dilip Gupta was chairman of the civic body, according to Basu. 

 The success stories in water supply, lengthening and maintenance of roads, development of parks and playgrounds and garbage disposal are being trumpeted. 

 The CPM ? upbeat after the recent success in 79 municipal body polls ? has identified at least five seats held by the Trinamul in Salt Lake that can be won this time.

 In ward No. 6 (CC and CD blocks), the party is leaving no stone unturned to defeat former party MP and now the Trinamuls projected chairman, Radhika Ranjan Pramanik. Biswajit Saha, a student leader, will take on Pramanik. The Trinamuls Manju Bannerjee had bagged the seat in 2000.

 In ward No. 5 ? covering Labony, EC block and Bidhan Abashan ? sitting Trinamul councillor Ashesh Mukherjee faces a tough fight from Chandan Ghosh, who had won last time from ward 17.

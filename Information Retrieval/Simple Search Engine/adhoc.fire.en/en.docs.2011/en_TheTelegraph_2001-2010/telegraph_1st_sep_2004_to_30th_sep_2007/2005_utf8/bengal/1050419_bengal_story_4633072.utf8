 Barasat, April 18: Bengal consumes a couple of tonnes of chocolate a day and spends over Rs 25 crore a year on the dark brown temptations.

 A milk cooperative in North 24-Parganas found the figures difficult to ignore and a new entity is set to hit shop racks ? Ben?s. 

 Sceptics may call it a chocolate castle in thin air, but Ichhamati Milk Producers? Union at Berachampa, 30 km from Calcutta, hopes to take on the big guns with its own brand.

 Egged on by the government, the milk producers? union has already kicked off a pilot project to explore the market. 

 As part of the project, it will manufacture about 100 kg of chocolate everyday, tentatively priced between Rs 15 and 17 for a 100 gm bar. 

 Besides chocolate, it will also produce pouched lassi and paneer under the same brand name. About 2,000 litres are now being made daily and sold from select counters in and around Calcutta at Rs 7 for a 300-ml pouch. 

 The ailing government dairy at Haringhata also manufactures chocolates, but it is no match for the popular brands in terms of quality or availability. The Haringhata unit figures on the government?s list of five dairies that it wants restructured. The list has been submitted to the Centre.

 ?We want to see the milk cooperative taking on the challenge to compete with known chocolate brands. But it needs a well-defined supply chain and top-grade marketing. Ichhamati is trying to do a good job,? said Anisur Rahman, the animal resources development minister. 

 Rahman?s department has provided Rs 15 lakh for the pilot project, likely to cost about Rs 50 lakh. The cooperative mobilised about Rs 20 lakh and the state?s District Rural Development Agency provided the rest. 

 Prabir Bhattacharya, managing director of the West Bengal Cooperative Milk Producers? Federation (a body of milk cooperatives) said sophisticated machinery are being used to manufacture the chocolates, paneer and lassi for the pilot project. ?We have started manufacturing chocolate bars and wraps in small quantities for trial. We will build up a fund with contributions mainly from the cooperative members for the advertisement campaign, to be launched by a professional agency,? he said. 

 ?To go into large-scale production, we need about Rs 1.5 crore. We have already approached the Centre and the state government. We will also tap financial institutions for loan,? added Bhattacharya.

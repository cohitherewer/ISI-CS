 Baby-death slur on hospital

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Jan. 17: Residents of Ghatal today gheraoed the superintendent of the subdivisional hospital to protest against the death of a baby because of the alleged negligence of the doctor.

 The parents of the dead child brought charges of negligence against paediatrician Tushar Kanti Ghosh and the throng of relatives and friends of patients admitted to the hospital prevented the doctor from entering the hospital.

 Hospital superintendent Sisir Das later said he had set up a panel to probe the matter. 

 Yesterday afternoon, Samita gave birth to a son, according to husband Pradip Manna.

 ?From late afternoon, the baby started having breathing problems and his condition started deteriorating,? said Manna. ?The doctor arrived very late and the baby died around 9.30 at night.?

 This is the second time in five days that the hospital?s doctors have been accused of negligence. On January 13, a woman lodged a complaint ? with family welfare commissioner Susanta Sen ? against a doctor after her baby died.

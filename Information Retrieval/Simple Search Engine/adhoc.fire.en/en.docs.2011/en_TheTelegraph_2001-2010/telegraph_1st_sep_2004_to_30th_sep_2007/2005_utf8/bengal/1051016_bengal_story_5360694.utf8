 Mental illness stalks mothers in jail

 - Long wait for Bangla inmates

 RAVIK BHATTACHARYA

 Calcutta, Oct. 15: Her wail echoes through the night. In the dark corner of her cell, a 28-year-old woman keeps aside a portion of her meal every day for her eight-year-old son. She believes he will return some day to share the meal.

 For Nusrat Begum (name changed), who lives in the confines of the Presidency Central Correctional Home in deranged condition, the wait for her son continues.

 Last year, both mother and son were arrested after they crossed over from Bangladesh without valid papers and were separated. The child was lodged in Kisholoy, a home for the juvenile.

 Nusrat is not alone. Hundreds of Bangladeshi mothers lodged in the Presidency and Dum Dum jails are suffering from acute mental illness caused by prolonged separation from their children, who are lodged in various state-run homes.

 The number of Bangladeshi women, including those who are victims of trafficking, has risen considerably in recent years. So much so that the school inside the dormitory cells and the proposed room meant to house a social welfare officer in the Presidency Jail have been occupied by them.

 Most of these women have been declared jaan khalas ? formally released by courts ? and are to be sent back to Bangladesh. But delay in official procedures has forced them to stay behind. Over 200 of them, now lodged in the Presidency and Dum Dum jails, are struggling to come to terms with the trauma of being separated from their children and have become critical mental patients.

 Many of them (Bangladeshi women) suffer from depression after being separated from their children. We are doing everything we can for these women, said Biswanath Choudhury, state minister for jails and social welfare.

 It takes an inordinately long time by Bangladeshi officials to verify their citizenship and we have to keep them in our jails because we cannot just throw them out. We are trying hard to treat their depression by counselling by qualified people, said Joydeb Chakraborty, inspector-general of prisons.

 According to rules, children above six years are separated from their mothers and lodged in juvenile homes. They cannot be lodged in jails as they fall under the Juvenile Justice Board and cannot be brought in to meet their mothers or vice versa as there is no such provision.

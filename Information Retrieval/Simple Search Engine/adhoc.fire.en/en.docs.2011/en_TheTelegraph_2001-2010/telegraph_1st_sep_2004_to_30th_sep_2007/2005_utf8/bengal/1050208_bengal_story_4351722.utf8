 Villagers on highway vigil

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Feb. 7: Taking a leaf out of the youths of Shamsergunj, the Murshidabad administration has drawn up a plan to set up resistance groups comprising villagers to man a national highway.

 The assignment will be to prevent looting of long-distance buses and trucks at night in areas under three police stations ? Farakka, Suti and Raghunathgunj.

 The residents of Shamsergunj and local truck owners had set up a resistance group, Paribahan Suraksha Committee, in 1999 with the help of police to guard the highway. The drive proved very effective as no crime was reported from the stretch of the highway adjoining the village in all these years. ?I was surprised... Since 1999, there has not been a single incident on NH-34 in Shamsergunj. So, we decided to set up similar resistance groups in Farakka, Suti and Raghunathgunj,? said Sanjay Singh, the district police chief. 

 In the areas where villagers would be on patrol, there have been at least 10 major highway heists in six months.

 Police sources said at Shamsergunj ? about 200 km from Calcutta ? the resistance group was set up with 70 unemployed youths, including some reformed criminals. They guarded a notorious stretch between Dakbungalow More and the Jharkhand border near Pakur. A toll of Rs 10 is collected from truck drivers daily and a fund has been created from it. The youths are paid between Rs 1,000 and 1,500 for their services. 

 Dressed in khaki uniform and armed with bamboo lathis and five-battery torches, these guards wait at different spots on the road and stop and search buses and trucks. 

 ?Our decision to set up the new resistance groups is modelled on the group at Shamsergunj. We are looking for about 150 local volunteers for the three areas,? said a senior police officer. 

 Their pay has yet to be decided. Like at Shamsergunj, the guards will be provided uniform, torches and lathis. 

 Apart from the national highway, the officer said, four other roads in the area have also been identified for patrol.

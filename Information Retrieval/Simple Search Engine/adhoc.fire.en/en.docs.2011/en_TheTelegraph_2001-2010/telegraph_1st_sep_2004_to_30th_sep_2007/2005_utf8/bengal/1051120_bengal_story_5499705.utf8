 End of LPG crisis in sight 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 19: The cooking gas crisis in the city and suburbs over the past two months will blow over in about a week, IOC officials said today.

 The Reliance refinery at Jamnagar was closed for around three months. This triggered a shortage of about 15 per cent across the country. However, the plant will open tomorrow and supply will stabilise soon. The crisis should be over in seven days if we can compensate with more LPG cylinders till then, IOC spokesperson Goutam Dutta said at Writers Buildings today. 

 One of the major suppliers of cooking gas in Calcutta, IOC brings around 165 trucks into the city every day from its bottling plants at Kalyani, Budge Budge and Durgapur. Each truck carries 306 cylinders.

 However, the supply had been erratic since September owing to a variety of reasons. 

 For about four days in September we faced labour trouble at our Kalyani plant and supply from there was zero. Distribution was again affected for a week in mid-October because of incessant rain. During this time, we could distribute only 20 per cent of our usual supply. The backlog rose further, explained an IOC official. With a daily output of 100 truckloads of LPG cylind-ers, Kalyani is IOCs biggest bottling plant. 

 The shortfall, coupled with rising demand during the festival season, led to a crisis. 

 LPG cylinders were not available even three weeks after booking in advance. Early this month, I procured one from the black market paying Rs 400, said Mousumi Mukherjee, a south Calcutta resident. 

 Hurricanes that lashed the US coast also struck the Indian consumer hard. Four refineries off the US coast were damaged and nothing could be imported from there. Now we have fresh stock at our import facility in Haldia. There is no cause for further concern, Dutta said. IOC is bringing in around 200 trucks every day to bridge the demand-supply gap.

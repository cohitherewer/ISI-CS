 Behrampore, Jan. 30: Five undertrials ? aged between 14 and 15 ? escaped this evening from Ananda Ashram, a children?s home here.

 Three of them are Bangladeshis ? Mohidur Ali, Mohammed Tuhin Hossein and Omar Farooq. Rajesh Das is from Narkeldanga in Calcutta, 200 km away, and Rofikul Sheikh from Murshidabad.

 Durgapur: Citu chief M.K. Pandhe said no headway has been made in the proposed merger of the Burnpur unit of IISCO with SAIL, despite Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan?s promise. ?Four months have passed, the minister is not showing any interest... IISCO workers have been cheated.?

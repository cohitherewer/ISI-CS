 Burdwan wrapped in Writers? Net 

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 Calcutta, May 3: Burdwan is going to be the first fully wired district in the country. 

 Acting on the state government?s request, the Centre has recently released Rs 4.96 crore for a pilot project to be implemented in the district.

 ?We have been pitching for the funds for some time and it is good news that the government has released the money. It is satisfying that on completion of the project, Burdwan will become the first fully connected district in the country,? said G.D. Gautama, the principal secretary, IT.

 The project envisages 8 mega bit per second (Mbps) leased-line connectivity between Writers? Buildings and all 277 village panchayats besides six subdivisional headquarters.

 Delhi has also released Rs 66.93 crore to connect all 341 blocks in Bengal and give a big push to the state government?s e-governance initiative.

 The state?s IT backbone now links up Writers? with 18 district headquarters and eight subdivisional towns through the West Bengal Statewide Area Network, which has a 2 Mbps data transfer capacity.

 The grant will be used to extend the reach of the network and upgrade it to 8 Mbps for better government-to-citizen interface through community information centres or kiosks.

 ?A monitoring committee with representatives from the Centre and the state government will implement the project. The committee will meet in Delhi next month to draw up the implementation plan. It will be done by inviting open tenders,? added Gautama. 

 According to the arrangement between the Centre and the state, the fund will finance networks, system software, system integration and cost of peripherals. Delhi will also provide money for training of personnel to run the kiosks. 

 But the revenue expenditure, involving day-to-day running and maintenance costs, has to be borne by the state government.

 Gautama said: ?The increase in connectivity will lead to better delivery of government services and people in remote villages will be able to access information on land records, examination results and prices of agricultural products in major markets.?

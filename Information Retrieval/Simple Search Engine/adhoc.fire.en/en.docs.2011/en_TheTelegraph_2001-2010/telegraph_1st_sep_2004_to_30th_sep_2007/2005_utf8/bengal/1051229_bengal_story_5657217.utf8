 Schedule for MIT ties

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 28: Premier 

 higher education institutions in Bengal will launch research 

 programmes with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 

 (MIT) within the next six months.

 Jadavpur University, Bengal University of Engineering and Science, Calcutta University, Indian Statistical Institute and IIT Kharagpur will identify areas in which they need the MITs help.

 They will submit a report to the government within two months so that the programmes can be implemented in the next six months.

 Similarly, the MIT will also prepare a report on research projects it wants to carry out with the above institutions.

 Some of our institutions are engaged in programmes with the MIT but they are working in a scattered manner. We want to ensure that they conduct the programmes in an organised way, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said after a meeting of representatives of the MIT, vice-chancellors of the state universities and the directors of the Indian Statistical Institute and IIT Kharagpur.

 Todays discussion was held to explore areas in which the institutions of Bengal can launch programmes with the MIT.

 Abhijit Banerjee, an MIT economist, and Arundhati Banerjee, director of the MIT India-Programme, were present at the meeting. Higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty and senior officials of his department were also there.

 Dasgupta had recently announced the governments plans to encourage Bengals premier institutions to start programmes with the MIT.

 Our universities and institutions like the Indian Statistical Institute and IIT Kharagpur are autonomous bodies.

 They will be free to identify not only the areas in which they are interested in conducting joint research but also the teachers and the departments they want to involve in these programmes, said Dasgupta. The government will only act as a facilitator.

 Job exchange role in court hands

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 March 28: Calcutta High Court Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurker has constituted a five-judge special bench to decide if it should be mandatory for government job applicants to be enrolled at the employment exchange.

 The chief justice set up the bench after two judges of the court expressed contrary views on the issue.

 Disposing of a petition, Justice Indira Banerjee had observed that the authorities had no liberty to appoint a person in a government-run establishment if he or she was not enrolled in the employment exchange. However, Justice Jayanta Biswas, while disposing of a similar petition, said the enrolment was not a must for a job in a government office.

 The court first took up the matter when some candidates selected for non-teaching posts in a government-run school were denied jobs by the management for not having their names registered with any of the employment exchange branches.

 The special bench of Justices Ashok Kumar Ganguly, Aloke Kumar Chakraborty, Dilip Seth, Prabir Kumar Samanta and Sadhan Kumar Gupta today sat to decide which of the two views to uphold. 

 Legal experts said government offices used to send letters of interview only to candidates whose names were sent by the employment exchange. But citing several Supreme Court rulings, the lawyers on behalf of the candidates in the two cases told the special bench today that the apex court had said the authorities should allow all candidates to appear for interviews for jobs in government offices. 

 The next hearing would be on April 4.

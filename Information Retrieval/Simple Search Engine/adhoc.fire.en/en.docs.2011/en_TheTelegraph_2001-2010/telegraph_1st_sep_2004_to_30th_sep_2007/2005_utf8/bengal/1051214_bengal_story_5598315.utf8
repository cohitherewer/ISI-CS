 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Dec. 13: The high court today asked BSF inspector- general R.K. Singh to appear before it for transferring a constable from Calcutta to Siliguri despite a court order not to do so.

 Constable Ram Bahadur Singh had filed a contempt petition saying though the BSF brass had been restrained from transferring him because of his sons spinal cord ailment, he was sent to Raninagar in Siliguri. The treatment for this rare disease is available only in metros. The child is now being treated in Calcutta. The BSF should withdraw the transfer order, Singhs counsel told the court. When BSF deputy inspector-general P.K. Kuswaha told the court Singh could not come today because he had been transferred to Gujarat, the judge said: Wherever he may be, he cannot flout a court order.

 Burdwan: Ashok Das of Jamar village here has been arrested for killing his four-month-old boy. On Monday afternoon, dogs were seen nib- bling at the body 10 km from Dass home, about 150 km from Calcutta. Police said he appeared mentally deranged and told them he killed him because he was feeling neglected by his wife.

 Midnapore: A tremor was felt at Pingla in West Midnapore, 100 km from Calcutta, on Tuesday afternoon. It measured 4 on the Richter scale at the IIT Kharagpur observation centre.

 Howrah: Several shops were gutted in a blaze near Bagnan station around 8 pm on Tuesday. Trains on the Howrah-Kharagpur section were stalled for over an hour from eight.

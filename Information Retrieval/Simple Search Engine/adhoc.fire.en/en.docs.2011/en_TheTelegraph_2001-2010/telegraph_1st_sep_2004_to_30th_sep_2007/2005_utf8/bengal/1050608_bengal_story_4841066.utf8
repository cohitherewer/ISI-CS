 Sonia to decide Cong team

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 7: Decks were cleared today for defence minister Pranab Mukherjees second term as the state Congress president.

 The pradesh Congress committee electoral college passed a one-line resolution this morning authorising party chief Sonia Gandhi to nominate somebody to lead the organisation in next years Assembly elections. 

 Mukherjee first took over as ad-hoc president in 2000 replacing the ailing party MP from Malda, A.B.A. Ghani Khan Choudhury. He was then elected president in June 2001.

 We did not elect the new office-bearers and, instead, passed a resolution requesting Soniaji to nominate them, Mukherjee said after the meeting of PCC functionaries.

 After taking over as defence minister, he had expressed unwillingness to continue as the state party chief. However, insiders said the high command wants him to steer the faction-ridden party to take in next years Assembly polls. 

 Besides president, Sonia will have to pick three vice-presidents, a treasurer and 36 executive committee members.

 We want Pranabda to continue as there is no other contender for the post, said former party chief Somen Mitra. 

 Union water resource development minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi moved the resolution, which state party working president Pradip Bhattacharya seconded.

 A senior leader said: Das Munshi was aspiring for the post, but pulled out following high commands pressure.

 Lover suicide

 Krishnagar, Jan. 9: Sephali Biswas, a girl of 16, allegedly committed suicide last evening after being jilted by Sambhu De, a school dropout son of a teacher. 

 Shefali had fled her home at Hematpur village in Dhantola, about 75 km from Calcutta, with De, her friend of three years. The boy, who lived with her at several places in North 24-Parganas and Calcutta for a fortnight, left her alone at Howrah station. De and his parents are absconding.

 Last day in city court for rally monitor 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 What Justice Lala tried to stop: A crippling rally in Calcutta

 Calcutta, Jan. 6: In 2003, Justice Amitava Lala of Calcutta High Court almost became a celebrity by passing a judgment restricting workday rallies in the city. 

 The order angered the average Left politician so much that a slogan was coined asking him to leave Bengal ? ?Lala, Bangla chhere pala?. 

 Today, Justice Lala actually ended his current stint in the high court and made arrangements to leave the state, but only after obtaining a salute. He would now sit as a senior judge in Allahabad High Court.

 Lawyers thronged his court and chamber to compliment him for his ?bold judgment?, a reference to the rally case. 

 Left Front chairman Biman Bose is still facing contempt proceedings in Calcutta High Court for publicly criticising Justice Lala and his restrict-rally order. 

 The lawyers thanked the judge for his cooperation and said they were not happy with the authorities? decision to have him transferred. 

 Like any other day, Justice Lala took his chair at Room No. 3 at 10.30 am. Till 1.10, he heard cases.

 When he was about to head to his chamber during recess, Sardar Amjad Ali, the president of the High Court Bar Association, said: ?My Lord, I, on behalf of all my colleagues, thank you for showing a good gesture towards the legal profession. You will be remembered for your bold judgments. We wish you success in the new assignment and the common people of Uttar Pradesh will surely benefit??

 He added: ?The way the authorities picked you from our court is undesirable. It has created a bad precedence...?

 The barristers? representative, Pradosh Mallik, too, felt the shift was unwarranted. ?We will remember you??

 Justice Lala heard the lawyers with a smile. Once he remarked: ?If judges are picked and chosen for transfer, it is obviously a matter of concern for the judiciary.?

 He went for the recess at 1.45 pm. The judge resumed work after that and left the courtroom again at 3.40. From his chamber, he emerged around 4. The traffic constable deputed to ensure his smooth passage saluted Justice Lala for the last time.

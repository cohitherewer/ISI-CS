 ?Fancy? projects for poverty

 - Villagers want water, govt gives something else

 NARESH JANA

 Midnapore, April 17: There is no drinking water in village after village in one of Bengal?s poorest pockets but, if the government has its way, generators will whirr after sunset to light up the area.

 The list of don?t haves and needn?t haves is long for about 300,000 Lodhas, Santhals and Mahalis across Jhargram, Belpahari, Salboni, Goaltore and Lalgarh in West Midnapore, about 200 km from Calcutta.

 The government embarked on a mission to tackle poverty in the region from where alleged starvation deaths and an increasing influence of Naxalite activities were reported last year. Not much has changed since. And the measures being mulled by the government are ?absurd? for many. 

 In villages without roads, irrigation or drinking water and access to healthcare, the administration has allotted funds for toilets and diesel-generated power. In two Jhargram villages ? Bhaudi and Mantipa ? that house about 40 Lodha families, the residents have refused to accept the ?low-cost? toilet scheme. Each family was asked to pay Rs 300 for it.

 ?There are no roads, no water. A stream, about 2 km away, is the only source of our drinking water. It dries up in the height of summer. What will we do with fancy toilets?? asked Budhu Sabar of Bhaudi.

 The likes of Budhu mostly earn their livelihood selling babui grass and kendu and sal leaves. An entire family earns between Rs 30 and 60 a day. 

 District magistrate Chandan Sinha admitted that there have been instances where priorities got mixed up. ?We are taking up projects to ensure supply of drinking water in places where low-cost sanitation projects have been taken up,? he added.

 At Dhangikusum in Naxalite-infested Belpahari, villagers trudge about 5 km to Jharkhand for drinking water. The primary health centre is 8 km away. Senior students have to walk at least 7 km for a bus to the nearest higher secondary school, 17 km away. The dropout rate at the primary school here is high as there are few opportunities beyond it.

 At Dhangikusum, too, the villagers have rejected the toilet scheme. It has met with the same fate at Joalbhanga, Dainmari and Pelibhanga villages of Jhargram.

 ?If someone has to be taken to the health centre, he has to be carried in a cot or a basket. We have serious doubts whether the government spares some thought for us at all. We want roads and water? not fancy schemes,? said Pitambar Singha of Shangikusum.

 At Chhurimara, Chakadoba and Bhimarjun villages in Belpahari, the administration has spent over Rs 50,000 on generators to provide electricity between 6 pm and 9 pm. The villagers were told to pool in the money to buy diesel. The generator sets are gathering dust for over a year because the poor villagers find it difficult to buy kerosene to light lamps, leave alone diesel. 

 The district magistrate said 1,424 villages have been identified for development projects. ?Top priority has been given to drinking water. Every village will have a new well and the old and defunct ones will be re-excavated,? he said.

 A conference organised by the Indian National Confederation and Academy of Anthropologists recently discussed the problems. The experts confirmed what was common knowledge ? unplanned development was leading to greater discontent among the villagers and outfits like the CPI (Maoist) were exploiting their disgruntlement.

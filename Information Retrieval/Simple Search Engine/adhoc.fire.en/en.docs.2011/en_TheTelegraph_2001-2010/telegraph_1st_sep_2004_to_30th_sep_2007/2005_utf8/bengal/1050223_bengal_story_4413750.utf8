 Leaders made to taste own pill

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 22: Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah has set out to reform his own backyard.

 A group of officers representing four unions from his department got a taste of it last Wednesday when they went to see him with a slew of demands.

 The team was made to wait for three hours outside the minister?s office. Finally allowed an audience, the leaders rolled out their charter in double haste. 

 The minister heard, and said: ?Do you know why I made you wait so long? I wanted you to know how it feels to wait outside someone?s chamber for three hours ? exactly how you harass people.? 

 Today, Mollah said: ?I also told them they were a bunch of thieves, indulging in rampant corruption.?

 The officers, who were shocked into silence, had more to bear. ?When a large portion of our population is jobless, how can you expect more salary?? the minister asked.

 Mollah had created a flutter last year saying two departments, police ? which is under the chief minister ? and his own, were the most corrupt and known to harass people. 

 ?Poor farmers come to me saying they were cheated by my officers. They make illiterate farmers pay Rs 600 as tax giving them a receipt for Rs 300,? he said today. ?Lower officers do these things on a smaller scale, but the senior officers are much more corrupt... They charge lakhs as bribe. It?s a chain.?

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who came to know about Mollah?s encounter with the union leaders, asked him after a cabinet meeting this morning what transpired between them. 

 The minister told him what he told them and that his drive would continue. 

 But the ?insulted? officers have sought redressal from the chief minister. Pranab Dey, the general secretary of the CPM-backed West Bengal Land and Land Reforms Officers? Association, said: ?We are seeking his intervention. We?re also publishing leaflets describing the minister?s indecent behaviour.?

 Family taunt triggers jump to death on new-year night

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, April 16: The first day of the Bengali new year turned out to be the last in Sangeeta Bagri?s life.

 Stung by her sister-in-law?s accusations, 28-year-old Sangeeta jumped off the fifth-floor balcony of her Vivekananda Road house in north Calcutta last night. 

 Around 9.30, a bleeding Sangeeta with a cracked skull was rushed to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, where she died a few minutes later. 

 Acting on a complaint lodged by Sangeeta?s mother Sarla Sarda, police arrested her sister-in-law Anju on the charge of abetment to suicide. 

 Sangeeta came home around 9 last night, after a round of Poila Baisakh shopping with her mother who arrived from Silchar yesterday. 

 Sangeeta had bought a toy gun for her two-and-a-half-year-old son Srehan. 

 ?Ecstatic with the gift that he had wanted for days, Srehan rushed to his grandmother Pushpa Devi (Sangeeta?s mother-in-law) to show it off,? said Ajay Kumar, the deputy superintendent of police. 

 Noise filled the house as Srehan kept pulling the trigger of his new toy gun, but no one seemed to mind. 

 Sangeeta was in her room talking to her husband Sanjeev, the younger of the two Bagri brothers, while Sarla played with Srishti, her six-year-old granddaughter. At the other end of the house, Sunil, the elder brother and Anju?s husband, was busy with his two children. 

 Anju was the only one who had a problem with the sound. She walked into Pushpa Devi?s room, snatched the toy gun from Srehan and smashed it to pieces. She then scolded the little boy, leaving him in tears. Srehan ran to his mother and narrated the incident. 

 When Sangeeta went to Anju, a war of words followed. 

 Anju began abusing her sister-in-law, saying she had made life intolerable for the entire family. ?We would be relieved if you were not here among us. Why don?t you die?? she asked in a fit of rage. 

 Sangeeta kept mum for a few minutes, then she turned and walked to the balcony. Before anyone could realise what she was up to, Sangeeta jumped to her death. 

 Officers at Girish Park police station said Anju has been charged with a non-bailable offence and can be sent to prison for up to 10 years .

 The first night of the new year saw another woman ending her life. 

 Alpana Basu, 39, set herself on fire around 8.30 last night at her sister?s flat at Northern Avenue under Chitpur police station. 

 Police said Alpana was living with her married sister Anjali Bhowmik after her husband deserted her and disappeared last year.

 Since then, she had been suffering from depression. On the night of Poila Baisakh, with no one around in the flat, Alpana doused herself with kerosene and set herself ablaze. 

 She was taken to hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival.

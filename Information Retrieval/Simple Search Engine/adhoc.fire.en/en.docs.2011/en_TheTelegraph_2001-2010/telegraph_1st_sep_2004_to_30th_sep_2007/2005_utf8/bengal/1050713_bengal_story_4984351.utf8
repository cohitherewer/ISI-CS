 Eviction call to babus

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 12: The high court today asked the two top bureaucrats in the state to explain why police could not evict illegal settlers from two private plots in East Midnapore and Burdwan.

 In separate reports placed in the court, the public works department (PWD) said that the police had expressed their inability to evict 25 families from a plot at Kanksa, Burdwan, and remove 8,000 structures on both sides of the Durgachak-Panskura highway in East Midnapore.

 After going through the reports, the division bench of justices D.K. Seth and R.N. Sinha asked chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy to state why the police had failed to carry out the evictions.

 Madan Mohan Pattanayak, a resident of Harihargram in East Midnapore, had moved a petition alleging that after the highway was widened, roadside settlers encroached his land. The police did nothing to oust them despite repeated complaints. He made the PWD a party to the case as it was the custodian of the highway. 

 The PWD told the court the police had failed to remove squatters not only from private plots, but also from the governments land. It said there are over 8,000 illegal settlers on both sides of the Durgachak-Panskura highway. 

 In the other case, Malati Goswami, who owns a five-bigha plot at Kanksa, had alleged that 25 families were occupying her land. When the high court asked for a report, Burdwan police virtually said it was impossible for them to evict the settlers.

 Bridge death

 Shikha Rajatia, 20, a resident of Uttarpara in Hooghly, was run over by a mini-bus on the Howrah bridge this evening. She was riding pillion on a two-wheeler, which was hit by the bus. As she fell to the ground, it crushed her.

 Mamata roars at capture call

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 27: Mamata Banerjee today said her party would retain Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) despite Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s ?threats?.

 The Trinamul Congress chief took offence to the chief minister?s plea to CPM cadre at a rally on Brigade Parade Grounds to ?capture? the civic body due to go to polls in June.

 Addressing party workers from south Calcutta at Nazrul Manch, Mamata said: ?It is unbecoming of a chief minister to say publicly that the CPM would ?capture? the corporation from us? It smacks of bad taste. Did he not encourage violence by saying such things??

 Kicking off the Trinamul campaign for the civic polls, Mamata said: ?We have already done our homework to retain the civic board. We shall fight the polls on our own with Subratada (Mukherjee) for mayor. We have done a lot for the city in our five-year tenure and want the people to vote for us for the second time.? 

 The Trinamul leader accused the CPM of launching a ?vicious campaign against our party? and called it a ?desperate bid to undermine our success at the CMC?. 

 There is a lesson for the CPM in Laloo Prasad?s setback in Bihar, felt Mamata. ?If Laloo can be jolted after so many years, why can?t we oust the CPM from Bengal?? 

 The Trinamul chief has been under pressure from within her own party to snap ties with the BJP-led NDA. But convinced that Trinamul can wrest power in the state if only the polls are fair, she said: ?We?ve decided to counter the CPM?s rigging by posting our supporters outside polling booths. During the corporation elections, at least 20 of our men would stand guard outside the booths to prevent the CPM men from entering.?

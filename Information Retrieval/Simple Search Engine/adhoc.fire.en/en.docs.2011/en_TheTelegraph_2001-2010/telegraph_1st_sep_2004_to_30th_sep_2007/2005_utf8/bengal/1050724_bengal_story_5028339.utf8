 Presidency washes hands of minister fracas

 A STAFF REPORTER

 On high alert 

 Calcutta, July 23: The principal of Presidency College has said his students were not involved in blocking higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakrabartys entry into the premises yesterday. 

 The air on the college campus continued to be thick with tension as the Students Federation of India staged a demonstration in front of the gates, from where the minister had been turned away. 

 A group, under the All India Democratic Students Organisation, an SUCI affiliate, protesting against the molestation of a student on the campus on Wednesday had blocked Chakrabartys way.

 This act of obstruction was done by outsiders belonging to some political affiliation and some members of the press also behaved in an unruly manner, Amitava Chatterjee said in a statement today. 

 Punitive action would be taken against any student found involved in the incident, the principal added.

 Police countered Chatterjees claim and said they have identified some college students as offenders. However, they said they did not forcibly push aside the students to prevent a rerun of the Jadavpur University fiasco. A baton-charge on striking JU students on the night of June 10 had kicked up a controversy over alleged police excesses. 

 There was adequate force ? six constables and a sub-inspector ? at the spot and police could have used force. But then, things could have gone awry, said deputy commissioner (central) Ajay Kumar.

 As the minister waited in his white Ambassador outside the college gates yesterday, a series of wireless messages informed senior police officers, including city police chief Prasun Mukherjee, about the fracas, police sources said. They decided that there should not be a repeat of JU. Accordingly, the policemen on the spot were asked not to use force. 

 What made matters difficult was the presence of three college girls who leapt in front of the ministers car. There was no lady constable with us who could have dragged them away. If we had to do so, especially in the presence of the electronic media, it would have sparked tension and made matters worse, said an officer from Jorasanko police station. 

 The police, however, said they would beef up security on the college premises. As a first step, policemen will be posted at the three gates and also next to Derozio Hall from 9 am to 7 pm. 

 Students would have to carry I-cards and even family members of the staff, living in the staff quarters on the campus, would be scanned before being allowed in. The college canteen will now be closed by 6 pm, said Sasanka Dey, the officer-in-charge of Jorasanko police station. If outsiders want to meet anyone from the college, they will have to seek permission over intercom from the gates, he added. 

 The move, though belated, has made students happy. This makes perfect sense.... Unless there is a system in place, how do we feel secure? Police presence is required, said student Kasturi Dutta Gupta.

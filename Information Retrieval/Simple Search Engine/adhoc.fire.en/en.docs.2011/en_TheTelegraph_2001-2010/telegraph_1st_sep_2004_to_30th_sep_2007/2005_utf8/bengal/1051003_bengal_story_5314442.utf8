 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Oct. 2: Seven people were killed this afternoon as a bus fell headlong into a roadside ditch at Falta in South 24-Parganas, about 50 km from here.

 Thirty people were hospitalised. Six of them were said to be critical.

 Police said the mishap occurred when the Falta-bound bus from Calcutta, on route 83, skidded on the slippery road at Majlishpur. Most of the victims were returning from the city after puja shopping. It was raining heavily. One of the tyres burst to make matters worse, said district superintendent of police S.N. Gupta. The driver and the cleaner of the bus could not be traced. Among the dead were a boy and girl, both 13. Shrabani Mondal could be identified from her school I-card. She is believed to have gone to shop with her parents, who are yet to be identified. 

 Durgapur: A Railway Protection Force jawan was arrested here on Sunday. P.N. Sharma, who was posted at Madhupur station in Jharkhand, was wanted in a murder case there. A probe after he knocked down a woman revealed his crime.

 Calcutta: Police have revoked the permission of a Durga Puja organised by Netaji Sangha at Moyna near Barasat town. On Thursday night, members of the club had stopped a vehicle on National Highway 34 and demanded Rs 1,000 from its driver.

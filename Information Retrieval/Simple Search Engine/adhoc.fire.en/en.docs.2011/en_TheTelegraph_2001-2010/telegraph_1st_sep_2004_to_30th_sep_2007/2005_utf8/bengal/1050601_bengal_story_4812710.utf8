 Mission gets a board bouquet 

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, May 31: The Ramakrishna Mission-run schools again came out with flying colours.

 But, for the first time in recent memory, the government-controlled West Bengal Board of Secondary Education had a word of praise for the performance. All the Ramakrishna Mission schools have done very well. We are happy with the brilliant result... They have been able to sustain their high academic standards?. said Dibyendu Hota, the president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, while announcing the Madhyamik results.

 The pat is significant as the Mission schools did not strictly adhere to all government policies despite accepting its financial assistance. They had also refused to recruit teachers through the School Service Commission. 

 The Mission finally relented after the government threatened to stop the financial aid. 

 There are more than 20 Mission institutions in the state. In seven, all students have secured first division. 

 At Ramakrishna Mission Boys Home in Rahara, on the northern fringes of the city, every student has scored 60 per cent or more ? they include 26 boys from the orphanage that the institution runs. Out of 222 students, 186 have scored 75 per cent or more in aggregate, said Swami Jayananda, the school secretary. 

 The other schools in the top seven include Baranagar Ramakrishna Mission, Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandir and the Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission Blind Boys Academy.

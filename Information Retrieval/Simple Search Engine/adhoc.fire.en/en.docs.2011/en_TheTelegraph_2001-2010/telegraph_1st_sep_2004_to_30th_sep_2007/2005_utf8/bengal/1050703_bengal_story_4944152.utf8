 Cop cover for power crooks

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 2: Law-keepers are shielding law-violators. 

 This equation has cost the citys power supply agency dear ? the CESC has been suffering losses of several lakhs every year.

 The problem surfaced after the CESCs loss-control cell removed hookings from a small pocket in Narkeldanga, which were causing power cuts across north Calcutta.

 But instead of taking action against the offenders, officials from Narkeldanga police station asked CESC authorities to restore the lines as early as possible. They said disconnecting them might give rise to a serious law and order problem.

 We are shocked at the role that the police are playing. We never thought it was possible. There is no question of restoring the lines that we disconnected during the drive against illegal hookings, said a CESC official.

 Javed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of the eastern suburban division, said: We provided CESC assistance during a daylong drive. But when they wanted to continue the drive, it was not possible for us to assist them any longer as it could lead to a law and order problem in the area.

 According to sources at Narkeldanga police station, slum-dwellers in the area had told officers that they would turn violent if the CESC carries on disconnecting the illegal lines. If thousands of people attack CESC men, how will we stop them? That is why we told them not to continue, said an officer.

 On the allegation that the officers had demanded that the illegal lines be restored, Shamim said: I will have to enquire about this and find out if such a thing has happened at the local police level. 

 The CESC had started an investigation after being flooded with complaints of recurring power cuts in east Calcutta. Our engineers and experts found that cable faults were the origin of the frequent load-shedding. During our search, we spotted hundreds of illegal connections in a shanty area on Chongru Singh Lane (in Narkeldanga). We disconnected at least 250 lines on June 30, said an official.

 But the trouble with the police began when the CESC wanted to continue the drive and snap 1,000 more connections. 

 We have disconnected the lines which were connected illegally to the overhead wire. Apart from this, there are more than 1,000 illegal lines connected to the underground wire, the official said. This is why we wanted to carry on the drive. We told the police that we would dig up the lane to detect the hookings. But they not only refused us assistance but also told us to stop.

 Lifer set free after 9 years 

 Calcutta, May 5: Subhas Roy, who had killed the man his mother had been living with and was sentenced to life nine years ago, was released by the high court today. 

 The division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A. Talukdar took into consideration the ?mental agony? of Subhas, 17 at the time of the murder in 1989. The resident of Dhupguri in Jalpaiguri, who has spent almost a decade in a district jail, should walk free by next week.

 ?He has already spent nine years in jail. His staying behind bars is enough for the crime he had committed out of mental agony,? the court said. 

 Subhass lawyer Tapas Mirdha said: ?His mother deserted him when he was 13 and started living with one Ganesh Roy. In 1989, Subhass father died. He went to Ganesh and asked him about his mother, but he drove him out after beating him up mercilessly.? This behaviour, Mirdha said, had prompted the boy to take revenge.

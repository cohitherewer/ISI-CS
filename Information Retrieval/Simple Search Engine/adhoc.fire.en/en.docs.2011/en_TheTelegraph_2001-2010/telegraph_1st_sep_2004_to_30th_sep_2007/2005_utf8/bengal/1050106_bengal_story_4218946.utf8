 Convoy cop suspended

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Jan. 5: A day after two policemen beat up the railway gateman near Krishnagar, a senior sub-inspector of Kotwali police station was suspended after an inquiry into the case. 

 Nadia district magistrate Rajesh Pandey today said Sanjit Chakraborty was suspended after a preliminary investigation found him guilty of beating up the railway gateman. 

 ?The SI was the seniormost officer present there and the charges levelled against him are serious. The administration cannot sit idle,? he said.

 Pandey has also asked the district police to carry out a thorough probe into the incident. 

 Yesterday, two policemen allegedly beat up gateman Mohammad Musharaf Hossain, forced open a level crossing gate and stopped an approaching train to allow the convoy of the state director-general of police to pass. 

 District officials, while investigating the matter after Hossain lodged a complaint with the Government Railway Police, found the policemen?s action illegal. 

 The district magistrate said a report on the incident had been sent to the state secretariat at the Writers? Buildings.

 Officials said when the police vehicle, riding ahead of the DG?s convoy to ensure the way was clear, came to a halt at the level crossing gate, two policemen jumped out of the vehicle and ordered Hossain to open the gate.

 He refused, saying it was not possible for him to open the gate for ?DG sahib?. 

 ?He (Hossain) even told the policemen that he would not open the gate even if Laloo Prasad Yadav (the railway minister) arrived,? a senior district police official said. 

 ?Apparently unable to take this refusal from the gateman, the policemen started beating him up.? 

 Officials said Chakraborty was told that the director-general of police, Shyamal Dutta, had a meeting with the chief minister at Writers?. 

 ?He (Sanjit) was eager to ensure that the DG was not delayed,? an official said.

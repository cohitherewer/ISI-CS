 SDO dropped

 Midnapore, Aug. 2: The subdivisional officer of Egra in East Midnapore has been suspended, the district magistrate said today. 

 I have received a directive from Writers Buildings to suspend the SDO of Egra, said R. Ranjit. He, however, refused to divulge the reason behind Pradip Banerjees suspension.

 Sources in the district administration said it was linked to a raid conducted on a ration shop godown two weeks ago. Two block development officers (BDOs) had raided the godown and allegedly seized Rs 8 lakh in cash and jewellery. Ranjit had served showcause notices on the officers for not handing over the seized items to police on time.

 Rape on college campus

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, June 8: A mentally-disabled Dalit woman was gangraped on the campus of Malda College last night. 

 The rapists allegedly tried to kill her when she threatened to go public.

 The woman approached the officer on duty at Englishbazar police station, who reportedly refused to take down her complaints. He sent her to the subdivisional hospital instead. 

 The police started the rape case today after the media mounted pressure. No arrests were made till late tonight. 

 The 40-year-old woman went to have dinner near Bichitra Cinema around 9 pm when three youths accosted her and took her to the campus where she was raped. They also gave her some money. 

 They tried to kill me with a broken bottle. Somehow I ran to the police station. The staff on duty did not even listen to me. They asked me to report to the hospital, the woman said from her hospital bed.

 Attending doctor D.N. Majumder said: When I came to examine her, she was not in a position to talk. Her head, face and chest bore marks of severe injuries. It is yet to be ascertained whether she has been raped.

 Officiating principal of the college, Dilip Nandi, said he was not surprised. I had told the police on several occasions that anti-social activities are regular on the campus after dusk. But they were indifferent.

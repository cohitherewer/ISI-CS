 Breast cancer drive in villages

 - November 

 launch for burdwan 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Nov. 2: Alarmed at the increase in breast cancer cases across rural Bengal, the state health department has come up with an awareness programme.

 The programme will be launched in Burdwan district in mid-November.

 The Burdwan Medical College and Hospital (BMCH), with help from Sankalpa, a non-government organisation working in the health sector, has set up teams of women volunteers. Numbering about 25, these volunteers are being trained by radiotherapists and gynaecologists.

 These volunteers have been trained to detect signs of breast cancer. They will visit the 5,000-odd villages in Burdwan district and approach women aged 16 years and above. They will tell them about self-examination of breasts and how to look for lumps and other signs, said BMCH principal Bijoy Mukherjee.

 Health officials said breast cancer had so far been seen as an urban disease. But from figures reported to the cancer ward of BMCH, we realised the matter needed to be addressed on a war footing. In rural areas, there is practically no awareness about breast cancer, a senior health department official said.

 Director of medical education Jayshree Mitra said: We have plans to launch an awareness programme for adolescent girls under which they will be told about self-examination of breasts, feeling for lumps and other signs.

 Mitra said the health department also plans to open cancer wards in hospitals at district headquarters. We need to have more experts so that we can treat cancer patients in our district hospitals.

 Breast cancer kills more people in rural Bengal than any other type, barring cervical cancer.

 The problem in rural areas is ignorance. Most patients approach us in the advanced stages and generally die within a year, said Subir Ganguly, head of the radiotherapy department at BMCH.

 Avijit Dey, resident medical officer of the radiotherapy department at BMCH, said: We advise that women should examine their breasts every fifth day of their menstrual cycle. Even women who have reached menopause should learn the techniques of self-examination and do it once a month.

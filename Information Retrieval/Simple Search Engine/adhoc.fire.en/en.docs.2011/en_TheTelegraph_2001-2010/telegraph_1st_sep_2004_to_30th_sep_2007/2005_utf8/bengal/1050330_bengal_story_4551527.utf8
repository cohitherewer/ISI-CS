 BRIEFS

 Cooch Behar, March 29: Nepal Mondol, 27, was today sentenced to death by a fast-track court for raping and killing Namita Roy, 11, his neighbour?s daughter.

 Hours after the girl went missing in a Baxirhat village on May 13, 1999, her grandmother, who had seen her go out with Nepal, found him sitting on a verandah, fresh from a bath and reading from the Gita. 

 Santiniketan: An abduction attempt on the Visva-Bharati campus was foiled when passersby spotted a gang trying to lift Arghya Kamal Roy, a Class V student of Siksha Satra, around 9.30 am. There were slashes on his legs, leucoplast on lips and his shirt had been ripped off. The miscreants fled. His father Manas Roy, a homeopath, said he had been receiving threats over a property row.

 Bolpur: Amita Sen, 92, mother of Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, took ill on Tuesday. Doctors said she was suffering from respiratory problems. She is being treated at her home, Pratichi, where Amartya Sen arrived tonight. A medical team led by subdivisional hospital superintendent Manabendra Ghosh is looking after her.

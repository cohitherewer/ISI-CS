 Call for farmer safety net in CPM land tussle

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Molla: Farm-friendly

Calcutta, Aug. 6: Industry cant be built in air, Anil Biswas had said yesterday. Today, Abdur Rezzak Molla ? the minister against whom the CPM state secretarys comment was principally directed ? said he was not against industrialisation, but farmers would have to be protected.

 After Biswas blasted the campaign in the party to portray the government as grabbing agricultural land to hand over to investors, Molla clarified that he only wanted a safety net for the displaced farmers. 

 Let me make it clear that I am neither opposing industrialisation nor am I saying townships are not needed, the land reform minister said. All I want is that certain terms and conditions be imposed on the investors to whom their (farmers) land is handed over so that they do not have to suffer, and also to ensure that there is no misuse of this land.

 It has become a trend in Writers Buildings that anyone coming with a concept paper and meeting ministers and the chief minister with grand proposals for setting up industries are handed over land. I want this to stop and put checks and balances in place, Molla added.

 He suggested that the proposals for projects be examined in detail by experts to find out if the amount of land sought was at all required and to have follow-up checks to see if it was being used for the purpose it had been handed over for.

 Molla had on Thursday voiced his reservations in the Assembly about the proposal to lift the rural land ceiling, bringing the dissent within the CPM out in the open. This also scuttled the amendment to the land reform bill that would have made acquisition easier.

 Party sources said both Biswas and Left Front chairman Biman Bose had spoken to Molla and asked him not to fuel the controversy further.

 Biswas refused to comment when asked about plans to provide land for Indonesias Salim group in South 24-Parganas, which Molla represents in the Assembly. The minister is against fertile land in the district being given away.

 Molla and colleague Kanti Ganguly, who together form the dominant force in the South 24-Parganas unit, have been asked not to publicise their differences with the government and only raise them within the party.

 Today, Molla said he would not stand as an obstacle before industrialisation and added he would be satisfied if promised that farmers who lose their land would be provided adequate compensation. 

 Other than the cost of land, paid at the prevailing market rate, Molla suggested that it be made binding on investors to provide the farmers housing and employment in the projects that come up.

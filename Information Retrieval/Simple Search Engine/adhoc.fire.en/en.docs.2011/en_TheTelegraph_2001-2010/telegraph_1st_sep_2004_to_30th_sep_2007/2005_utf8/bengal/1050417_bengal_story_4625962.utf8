 Slur on Apollo

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 16: The family of Kanchan Choubey, whose body was handed over by Apollo Gleneagles Hospital to another family by mistake, has alleged that medical negligence led to her death.

 The Choubeys have charged Apollo with concealing evidence and negligent treatment. ?We want a thorough investigation... The body was not handed over by mistake, there is something deeper,? said Sanjay, Kanchan?s brother.

 On Wednesday, the hospital gave 60-year-old Manabendra Chakraborty?s body to Kanchan?s family and her body to Manabendra?s relatives.

 ?My sister died of over 60 per cent burns, but we have reasons to believe she was not attended to properly by the hospital staff. We have not got any documents regarding her treatment,? Sanjay alleged.

 CM cant say no to industry

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 7: With demand for land far outstripping supply, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government will earmark another 300 acres in Rajarhat for IT and IT-enabled services (ITES) companies. 

 The chief minister made the announcement today at the inaugural session of a two-day national convention on e-governance in the city. 

 The demand for land is increasing and we cannot say no to them. We have to give land to industries interested in setting up units here. Thats why we are earmarking another 300 acres of land in Rajarhat for IT companies, Bhattacharjee said while delivering his address on Bridging the Digital Divide ? Village Knowledge Centres. 

 Dayanidhi Maran, the Union minister for IT and communications, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, Nilotpal Basu, MP and chairman of Grameen Sanchar Society (Grasso), and Bengals infotech and environment minister Manab Mukherjee were present at the programme, which marked the launch of the Bengal chapter of Mission 2007. 

 The mission, adopted by a national alliance of over 150 members, envisages an information, communication and technology (ICT) revolution sweeping all villages in the country through a public-private partnership model. 

 After briefly discussing the states achievements in the software industry, Bhattacharjee focused on the theme of the convention. We have to reach the districts, blocks and villages. We need your help in that mission, the chief minister said, stealing a glance at Ahluwalia and Maran and subtly putting in the states demand for higher central grants. 

 In his speech, Maran said the Centre has already released around Rs 70 crore to ensure connectivity up to the level of 341 blocks in the state. A pat from the central minister accompanied the announcement as he added: When we announced the governments plan to assist states to develop state wide area networks (SWAN), West Bengal was the first to place its demand. It is clear that the government is serious. 

 The Centre is also assisting the state to take connectivity up to the level of panchayats in Burdwan with a grant of Rs 4.85 crore. 

 Promotion of e-governance is a priority for the government as it means empowering the society at grassroots, Ahluwalia said, stressing the importance of creating ICT infrastructure. He added that the government has already allocated Rs 3,334 crore for statewide area networks with 2 Mbps connectivity. 

 While all the speakers acknowledged the governments role in bridging the digital divide, the need to involve the civil society for the right impact resonated through the days. 

 Grasso, an NGO, is trying that in Bengal by spearheading a project of setting up community information and service centres across the state as part of the state e-governance project. Our aim is to provide 3,354 kiosks covering all blocks and panchayats in the first phase. We intend to create successful rural entrepreneurs based on ICT, summed up Basu.

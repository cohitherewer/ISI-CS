 GNLF speaks in two voices

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Aug. 13: A section of Gorkha National Liberation Front leaders today sang a different tune to organisation leader Subash Ghisingh, who had mellowed on demarcation of the jurisdiction of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, saying he would accept whatever the state offered.

 Shanta Chettri, the firebrand Kurseong MLA said the party still demands that the whole of Darjeeling district, including Siliguri, be under the purview of the council.

 Our demand of bringing the whole district under DGHC still stands and we will press for it at the next tripartite meeting to be held in Delhi in early September, Chettri told the hundreds who had gathered at the public rally at Sukna and refused to move even when it started raining.

 The rally comes at a time when Opposition parties in the hills had begun to criticise the tacit understanding between the state government and Ghisingh.

 (Peoples Democratic Front chairman) Madan Tamang is crazy. It is they who met top CPM leaders at Alimuddin Street several times for their own interests. We never did so. They (PDF and the Left, who have agreed on a seat-sharing arrangement) seem to fallen out with each other and the PDF is unnecessarily blaming us, said the GNLF leader. 

 Chettri also came down heavily on urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya and accused CPM leaders of trying to influence the Nepali-speaking people in the plains with the development promise.

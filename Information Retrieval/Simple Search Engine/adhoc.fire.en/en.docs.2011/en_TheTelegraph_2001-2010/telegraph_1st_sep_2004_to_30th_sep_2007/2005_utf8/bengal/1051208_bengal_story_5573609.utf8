 Cop cash to gag victim

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Asansol, Dec. 7: A police official in Burdwan gave an alleged rape victim Rs 1,000 for treatment and, instead of registering her complaint, asked her to settle the matter with the accused.

 Burdwan police chief Peeyush Pandey today ordered a probe into the behaviour of Sanjay Kundu, the sub-inspector in charge of the Rupnarayan outpost in Salanpur.

 The 35-year-old tribal was allegedly raped by a local farmer, Gaju, at Dangalpara village in Salanpur, 260 km from Calcutta, on the evening of November 16. Her daily wage-earner husband, Dhanu, was away on work and she was alone at home.

 Initially, I did not want to go to the police because I feared harassment. But two days later, when my husband returned, I told him everything, the woman said. We went to the outpost where the police officer gave me Rs 1,000 for treatment and asked my husband to settle the issue with the accused as we were poor.

 Kundu, the accused sub-inspector, refused to comment. Its not clear whether he paid the money out of his own pocket and what his motive was.

 The police are bound to accept complaints from anyone who comes to a police station or outpost. Strong action will be taken against those found guilty, district superintendent of police Pandey said. He has sought a report from the Asansol additional superintendent, Satyajit Banerjee, and ordered Salanpur police station to send a team to the womans home, register a case and arrest the accused.

 After the police refused to register her complaint, the woman had approached the CPMs womens wing, Ganatantrik Mahila Samiti, who took the matter up with the district police chief last week.

 Girl goes missing from college

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Shraddha

Calcutta, April 23: A day after she was seen last, the disappearance of 19-year-old Shraddha Didwania remained shrouded in mystery.

 Shraddha, a first-year BCom student of the morning girls? section at Seth Anandram Jaipuria College, went missing on Thursday. 

 She was last seen by one of her classmates going out of the college along with another common friend Parul. 

 ?She set out for the college as usual ? around 6.45 am ? on Thursday. She was to complete the registration for her first-year examinations. Generally, she comes back from the college around noon. On Thursday, she didn?t?? said a sobbing Gunmala, the missing girl?s? mother, at her 418/1 G.T. Road house in the Golabari police station area of Howrah.

 Parul, who lives nearby and used to go to college with Shraddha, said they went to a local Hanuman temple on their way to the college on Thursday. ?Shraddha offered puja at the temple. She was looking a bit thoughtful,? said Parul.

 ?That day, we walked to Howrah station and took a bus on route 215A from there. We got down near the college. That is our usual route. Around 10:15 am, I saw Shraddha stepping out of the college premises with one of our common friends. That was the last time I saw her.?

 Shraddha?s father Sukumar alleged that she had been kidnapped. He claimed she told him over phone around 1 pm on Thursday that she would be returning home late since the registration process had kept her at the college longer than expected. 

 ?When she didn?t come home even past 2.30 pm, we went to the Golabari police station to lodge a complaint. But the officer said the complaint should be lodged with the Shyampukur police station as the college falls under its jurisdiction. Accordingly, we lodged a complaint with the Shyampukur police. Later, on instructions from the police station, we lodged another report with the missing person?s squad at Lalbazar,? the father said.

 The officer in charge of Shyampukur, D.C. Dey, said ?we couldn?t find out what exactly happened in the college? as it was closed yesterday. ?From the crowd that generally gathers at the entrance around the time the girl appears to have left the college, kidnapping is almost out of question. We are looking into other possibilities.?

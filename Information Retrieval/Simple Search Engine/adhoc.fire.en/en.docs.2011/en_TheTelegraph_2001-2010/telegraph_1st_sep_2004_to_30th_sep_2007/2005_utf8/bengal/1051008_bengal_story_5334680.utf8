 CBI probe for missing jawan

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 7: The high court today ordered a CBI probe into the disappearance of a jawan from an army camp in Ambala in Haryana.

 The court passed the order on a habeas corpus petition moved in 2003 by the wife of Tapas Kumar Pal, a resident of Sonda in Bankura, around 200 km from Calcutta.

 Mita Pal said in her petition that her husband had been missing since early 2002 from the Ambala camp. The army authorities said my husband had deserted the camp, she added.

 Mita also informed the court that in March 2002, she had received an anonymous letter saying her husband had been killed by the army authorities.

 Soon after receiving the letter, my father and brother-in-law went to Ambala to enquire about my husband, but the army authorities did not allow them to enter the camp, Mita said in her petition.

 Paresh Chandra Maity, the petitioners lawyer, informed the court that his client was passing days in hardship after the incident.

 After hearing Maity and the armys counsel, the judge decided to order an inquiry into the incident.

 The CBIs lawyer, Ranjan Roy, said he would convey the order of the court to his client.

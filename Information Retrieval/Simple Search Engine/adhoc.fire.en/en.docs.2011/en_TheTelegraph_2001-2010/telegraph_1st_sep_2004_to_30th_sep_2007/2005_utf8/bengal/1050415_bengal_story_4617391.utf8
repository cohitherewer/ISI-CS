 Police look for ?torture? teacher

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Tiyasa

 Chinsurah, April 14: Harasit Biswas, whose daughter Tiyasa hanged herself in a classroom of St Joseph?s Convent, Chandernagore, has charged the school with ?suppressing facts and removing evidence? and held her class teacher ?totally responsible? for the death.

 The father, who lodged an FIR yesterday, sought the class teacher?s punishment under Section 305 (abetment of suicide of a child) of the IPC. 

 Police began looking for the teacher after the FIR was lodged, but her house was said to be under lock and key.

 Hooghly superintendent of police Supratim Sarkar said a probe into the Class IX student?s death on April 6 has begun and a search is on for the teacher. She was apparently peeved with her for not taking private tuition. 

 Biswas said: ?Tiyasa fell from her grace because she refused to take tuition like other students of her class and never cared to offer flowers and presents on her birthday. The teacher used to mentally torture her?. She would often ask Tiyasa to remain standing and try to undermine her position in front of her mates. She would misbehave with her and mark her ?C? in conduct. My daughter would often tell us the teacher had turned her life hell.?

 According to the FIR, Tiyasa, 14, expected a new class teacher after she got promoted to Class IX this year. 

 ?She was dismayed to discover that the teacher concerned would continue to be her class teacher?. Tiyasa did not allow us to lodge a complaint against the teacher with the principal, saying that would further invite the authorities? wrath and she would be ?marked? out,? said her father, a pathologist by profession.

 The district police chief said: ?Our officers visited the teacher?s house yesterday, but could not trace her. We will certainly interrogate her in connection with the death.?

 Biswas also demanded a CID investigation. ?The school authorities might have removed the suicide note after breaking open the door of the classroom before the police arrived. Hence I feel the CID should be given the charge to investigate my daughter?s death and allowed to interrogate the durwan,? he said in the FIR.

 He alleged that he was informed about Tiyasa?s death almost two hours after she was found hanging in her classroom. ?My brother-in-law reached the school at 11.20 am, but was allowed entry around 12.40. A team of journalists was also made to wait outside for one-and-a-half hours. All this indicate the school?s guilt and attempt to suppress facts.?

 Asked why he took a week to file the FIR, Biswas said: ?We expected the school to express sympathy over the tragedy. But not a soul turned up from the school to console us?.?

 Sister George, the principal, tried to give a clean chit to Tiyasa?s class teacher. ?She?s been teaching here for the past 23 years. There have never been complaints against her.?

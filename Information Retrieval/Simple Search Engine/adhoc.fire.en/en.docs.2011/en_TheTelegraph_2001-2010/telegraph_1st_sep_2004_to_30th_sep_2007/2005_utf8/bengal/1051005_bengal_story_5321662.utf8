 Industry plank gifts CPM a landslide

 OUR BUREAU

 Chowdhury: Basking in Buddhas glory? 

CPMs victory margin 

2004: 1,23,546 

2005: 2,29,941

 Calcutta, Oct. 4: Powered by the chief ministers campaign for industrialisation, the CPM today retained the Asansol Lok Sabha seat, virtually wiping out the Opposition parties in the byelection held on September 28.

 The CPM nominee, cottage and small-scale industries minister Bansagopal Chowdhury, won by 2,29,941 votes, a near 100 per cent improvement on the partys victory margin of 1,23,546 in 2004.

 Our landslide victory is a popular endorsement of Buddhas (Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees) campaign for industrialisation, said Jyoti Basu. It will encourage us to go into next years elections with confidence.

 Necessitated by the death of Bikash Chowdhury, the former CPM member of Parliament, the bypoll ? the result of which was declared today ? was keenly observed for being the last election before the fight for Writers, roughly seven months away. 

 If the outcome is anything to go by, the CPM and its allies appear set to improve their position in the Assembly riding on Bhattacharjees industrialisation drive. Chowdhury bagged 4,10,739 votes, Bikash had got 3,69,832.

 Trinamul Congresss Malay Ghatak got 1,80,798 votes. Last time, Mamata Banerjees party had secured over 60,000 more. The Congress candidate, Pravat Gowsami, had his deposit forfeited, having secured only 52,569 votes.

 If anything, the Asansol result must be regarded as a reflection of the happy mood of Bengal in the wake of the performance of Buddhadebs government, Basu said in the course of an interview with The Telegraph. 

 A quick analysis shows the CPM polled 10 per cent more in the byelection to raise its vote share to 61 per cent, while Trinamuls shrank from 34 per cent in 2004 to 27 per cent. The Congresss vote share went down relatively less ? from 10 per cent to 8.

 The CPM was also jubilant as the result showed that the Opposition campaign on the plank of transfer of farmland for Salim Group projects in North and South 24-Parganas had been rejected. 

 State CPM secretary Anil Biswas said the average voter had completely turned his back on the Opposition parties, which sought to make an issue of the land transfer. 

 This is just the beginning. They would now have to rethink their planks for the coming election. People will reject their false campaign against us in the coming days, Biswas said. 

 The party, he added, has been consolidating its vote bank since last years panchayat polls. We have increased our vote share in every byelection.

 Another factor that made the CPM leaders happy was the fact that, contrary to a widely held view, expelled former MP Haradhan Roy, also a veteran trade unionist in the coal belt area, could not cut into the CPM votes. Roy had pledged support to Trinamul.

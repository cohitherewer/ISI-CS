 Raped, and then sold

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, July 5: Agricultural labourer Afazaddin Sheikh, a resident of Natungram in Murshidabad, married off his 16-year-old daughter to a man from Uttar Pradesh four months ago, without any inkling of the trauma the girl would have to go through.

 Not only did the groom turn out to be a fraud, he sold off the girl, Firoza (name changed), to a landlord for Rs 4,000 in Muzaffarnagar in Uttar Pradesh. Before handing her over to the landlord, she was raped for a week by her husband. Firoza was forced to work as a labourer in a brick kiln during the day by the landlord, Sabir Ahmed, and was repeatedly raped by him and his son at night.

 Afazaddin was completely in the dark until two weeks ago when a local youth, Heren Shah, spilled the beans to villagers. 

 The groom from Uttar Pradesh was none other than his sister Ashia Bibis husband Arif Sheikh.

 Following a complaint from Afazaddin, Bengal police arrested Heren and took him to Muzaffarnagar where Ashia stayed. But both Ashia and Arif had fled by then, possibly alerted by a contact in Murshidabad who had relayed the news of Herens arrest. 

 However, the Bengal police team with the help of their Uttar Pradesh counterparts managed to arrest Sabir Ahmed, the landlord. Firoza was brought to her home in Natungram, 215 km from Calcutta, yesterday.

 According to the police, Ashia had arranged the marriage telling Afazaddin that the groom was her brother-in-law and would not take any dowry for the marriage. Afazaddin, who earns about Rs 30 a day as an agricultural labourer, thought it was a good proposal.

 I did not suspect anything as Ashia was a local girl who got married off to a man in Uttar Pradesh five years ago. Also, the grooms decision not to claim any dowry was quite lucrative as in our society we have to pay a minimum amount of Rs 20,000 in cash to the groom, said Afazaddin.

 Inspector-in-charge of Murshidabad police station Pradip Dam said it was Heren who led the police to Firoza in Uttar Pradesh. 

 Immediately after receiving Afazaddins complaint, we arrested Heren. Interrogating him, we learnt that Arif was not Ashias brother-in-law but her husband. We took Heren with us to Uttar Pradesh and rescued Firoza from the landlords house in Bhanri village of Muzaffarnagar. We also arrested the landlord, Sabir Ahmed, he said. It is by the grace of Allah that I am united with my daughter today. I had agreed to the marriage because I was told I would not have to pay any dowry. I thought I will not get such an understanding groom and agreed to hand my daughter to him, said Afazaddin.

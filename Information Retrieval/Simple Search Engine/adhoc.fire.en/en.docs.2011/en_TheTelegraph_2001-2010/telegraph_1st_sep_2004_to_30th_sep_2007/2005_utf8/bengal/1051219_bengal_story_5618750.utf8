 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Dec. 18: The bandh on Tuesday called to protest against Sourav Gangulys ouster from the Test squad has been withdrawn. 

 The association that had called it said the decision followed Souravs appeal to show restraint.

 Burdwan: Twenty-one children have died in five days in Burdwan Medical College Hospi- tal. No one has lodged a complaint but Gopal Dey, whose daughter died, said: When we looked for the doctor and nurses, they were not there. The hospital said the death rate was normal.

 Calcutta: Manas Giri, a daily wager, set fire to his house at Patharpra-tima with his wife and daughter inside after his wife learnt about his affair. One-year-old Priya is dead. Jamuna, 28, is in hospital.

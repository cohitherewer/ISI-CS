 Govt says do it slow

 Bhattacharjee: What?s up?

 Calcutta/Burdwan, Jan. 16: The Golden Quadrilateral project to connect the four metros has again hit roadblocks in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s do-it-now Bengal.

 Work on several stretches of National Highway 2 in Hooghly and Burdwan is stalled for the past several months as residents demand more and more underpasses. 

 In Hooghly?s Singur, about 50 km from Calcutta, residents backed by CPM leaders have forced the National Highway Authority of India to stop work on widening and strengthening of the 60-km Palsit-Dankuni stretch of NH-2 near Ratanpur.

 ?Residents want an underpass, but we?ve already constructed one about 200 m further up in Singur. We set up the underpass there as a railway overbridge already exists. Another underpass here would turn the road into a roller coaster. We?ve categorically stated that an underpass here is not technically possible,? S.P.S Bakshi, the authority?s chief general manager, (technical), told The Telegraph from Delhi. 

 District magistrate Roshni Sen said: ?We even offered to build a pedestrian overbridge at the spot, but the residents didn?t accept it.? She wrote to the public works department last November about the problem and is still awaiting a response.

 After taking over as the chief minister in 2000, Bhattacharjee had coined the ?do-it-now? slogan to pep up work culture in the state. But not much seems to have improved as some departments continue to be lethargic and CPM leaders rabble-rousers. 

 When the highway authority raised the problem at a recent meeting to review the project at Writers? Buildings, chief secretary Asok Gupta reportedly asked them to ?go slow? on the project.

 Today he said: ?The matter is likely to take time in getting sorted out as residents and political parties are adamant.?

 Local MP Rupchand Pal, who has written to the Union ministry for shipping, road transport and highways, demanding the underpass, was unwilling to explain his role in the demand. ?I only forwarded the residents? demand?? he said over phone from Hooghly. Asked to comment on reports that he was instrumental in holding up work, the CPM leader hung up.

 It is a similar story in Burdwan. Work on the 65-km Panagarh-Palsit stretch, suffered from residents? agitation and political interference. At Pursha near Galsi, 160 km from Calcutta, residents held up work for six months demanding re-hauling of the drainage system. Highway authority officials said work is stalled in about 20 places in the district because of demands for underpasses and footbridges.

 A highway authority official said: ?We have provisions for underpasses, but too many of them hamper speed on the highway and raise the cost. Each underpass costs at least of Rs 4 crore.?

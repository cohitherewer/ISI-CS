 Suicide after salwar denial

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Oct. 8: For the Ghosh family, there is no Puja this year.

 Denied her much-longed for salwar kameez for the festival, Chandana, 17, the youngest daughter of Balaram Ghosh, hanged herself last night in Murshidabad.

 Police said family members found the Class XI student of Madhurkul High School near Domkol, about 240 km from Calcutta, hanging from the ceiling of her bedroom around 10 pm yesterday.

 Chandana apparently took such a step after being scolded by her mother. 

 The family decided that a colour television would be purchased during the festival this time instead of any new clothes. But Chandana disagreed and wanted to have a new set of salwar kameez. She had an altercation with her mother last evening. She went back crying to her room and locked herself. Later, when her father enquired about her before dinner, he discovered what she had done, said a police officer.

 Balaram, who is yet to recover from the shock, admitted that his wife had scolded Chandana when she had insisted on having the new clothes. When I went to call my daughter for dinner, I got no response. I looked through the window only to find her body hanging from the ceiling fan. We never thought she would take such a step for a dress, he said.

 I cannot imagine that a girl could end her life for new clothes. We have registered a case of unnatural death, said district superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh.

 A pall of gloom descended on Madhurkul as news of the incident spread. 

 Members of the Madhurkul Sarbojanin Durgotsav Committee have decided on low-key festivities. We shall not go for any gorgeous decoration of the pandal and its lighting, said Bikash Ghosh, one of the organisers. The immersion procession will also be low-key.

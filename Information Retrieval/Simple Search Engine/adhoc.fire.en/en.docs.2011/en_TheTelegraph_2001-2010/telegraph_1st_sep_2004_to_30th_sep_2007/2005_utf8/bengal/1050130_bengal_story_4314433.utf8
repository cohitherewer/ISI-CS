 Govt mulls extending dole cover 

 SWATI SENGUPTA 

 Calcutta, Jan. 29: The government is planning to bring more destitute persons under the umbrella of its various pension schemes. 

 Prompted by the National Commission for Women, the government is mulling a 10 per cent increase in the number of beneficiaries under the three pension schemes it funds. It now spends about Rs 33 crore annually for the schemes meant for widows, the aged and the disabled. 

 The women?s commission, during a recent visit, urged the government to raise by 10 per cent the number of widows eligible for the dole, said S.. Haque, secretary of the women and child development department. 

 ?There are long waiting lists of widows in every district who want this government benefit of Rs 500 per month. Sometimes, condition of the pensioners improve and only if they disqualify can we include other widows. But even then, the waiting list is very long and so we are planning to increase the number of beneficiaries,? he said. 

 If widows remarry or their income increases, they are disqualified and the wait-listed women can receive the dole. 

 Following the prod, senior officials have been working on the possibility of increasing the number of beneficiaries in the other schemes as well.

 ?We took an overall view and felt that since similar problems exist in the other pension schemes. If the number of beneficiaries has to be increased, it should apply to the two other pension schemes funded by the state government as well,? an official said. 

 The social welfare department, also headed by Haque, has sought greater allocation from the finance department to fund the increased payment. 

 To qualify for the scheme, the monthly family income of widows and the disabled must not exceed Rs 100. For the aged, the qualifying age is 60 with a personal income less than Rs 100 every month.

 ?However, we are quite lenient about the income criterion because Rs 100 or more is too small an amount to run a family or sustain oneself. What we consider carefully is whether the applicants are poor, needy and uncared for and whether they really ought to get the benefit of the schemes,? the official said.

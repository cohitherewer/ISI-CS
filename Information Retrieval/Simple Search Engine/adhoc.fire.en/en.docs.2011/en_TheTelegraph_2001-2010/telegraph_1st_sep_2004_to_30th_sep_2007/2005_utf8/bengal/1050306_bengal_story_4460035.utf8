 Lawyers chip in for medical centre

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, March 5: Shaken by the death of a colleague on the Calcutta High Court premises due to lack of medical facilities, lawyers have decided to set up an emergency unit with their own money. 

 Work at Calcutta High Court virtually came to a standstill yesterday after advocate Gunendra Chandra Ghosh?s death. 

 Lawyers held a demonstration in front of the court?s medical unit as their colleague?s body lay on the floor. They refused to go back to work till the government promised improved medical facilities.

 Sardar Amjad Ali, president of the Calcutta High Court Bar Association, said today: ?We had a meeting on this recently, and some lawyers said Rs 3 lakh was at hand now. Some more money can be raised and we will arrange for the modern unit on our own. So we have asked for space from the high court authorities within a week.?

 Ali alleged that a portion of the existing medical unit was being used by police as an outpost. ?We have demanded that the police be removed from that area,? he said. 

 There is only one doctor in the medical unit. He also has to be at other places like the new secretariat building, the city civil court, the PWD building and sometimes even Writers? Buildings. 

 At least 10,000 people, including 6,500 lawyers, 1,500 employees and several thousand litigants, are in court everyday, and this makes a medical unit with an ambulance all the more crucial.

 ?How is it possible for a single medical practitioner to attend to all these places simultaneously? This is the reason we have approached several eminent doctors of the city who have told us that they are ready to offer voluntary services,? Ali said.

 Murder strips duo of doctor tag

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 6: The State Medical Council today cancelled the registrations of the two doctors sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of surgeon Chandan Sen.

 Subharanjan Khanra and Rahamat Alam are among four persons awarded the punishment yesterday after they were found guilty of killing Sen, a surgeon of Ranaghat Subdivisional Hospital.

 President of the council Ashok Chowdhury said the conviction of the doctor duo has brought shame on the medical fraternity. 

 It pains us to believe that two doctors have been convicted for murdering another doctor. This is utter shame for our fraternity and we need to immediately sit up and take a note of the situation. The registrations of these two doctors will stand cancelled with immediate effect, he said.

 The incident also prompted the Indian Medical Association (Bengal branch) to send letters to its members reminding them of their professional integrity and the consequences of digressing from their oath. 

 The associations secretary, Swapan Nag, said the matter would be discussed threadbare at the next meeting of its state council on July 17.

 Stripped of their registrations, Khanra and Alam will not be able to treat any patient officially until a higher court pronounces them innocent.

 The State Medical Councils penal and ethical committee will convene an emergency meeting to discuss instances of doctors digressing from the protocols of standard medical practice and indulging in affairs that are often criminal in nature. 

 We will discuss how a section of doctors is tarnishing the image of the fraternity. This is really a serious issue and we want everyone to realise that doctors have certain commitments to the society and that this is not just about taking money and rendering service, said Subir Dutta, the vice-president of the council.

 The health department, too, is taking up the task of reminding doctors about devotion towards their profession and is thinking of holding workshops and seminars, said Prabhakar Chatterjee, the director of health services.

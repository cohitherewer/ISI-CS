 Workers form watchdog

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, May 30: After firing allegations of corruption against the management, employees of the state-owned Durgapur Projects Limited (DPL) have decided to take matters in their own hands. 

 A committee ? comprising staff belonging to unions affiliated to both Citu and Intuc and members of officers and engineers associations ? came into being last week to monitor work orders issued to private contractors.

 The 12-member committee submitted a memorandum to state power minister Mrinal Banerjee on Saturday. Members said they would give him a periodic report on tenders floated by the management and awarding of work orders.

 Banerjee promised to investigate all complaints. As a matter of policy, we always try to maintain transparency about tenders. The trade unions and the officers at DPL have complained to me about irregularities at DPL. We will definitely carry out an inquiry.

 The DPL comprises a power plant, a coke oven plant and water works. 

 The committee alleged that the DPL had recently issued a work order of about Rs 18 crore to a Mumbai-based private company for feeding ammonia gas to help control ash at four power generating units without a prior tender notice. The DPL signed a one-year agreement with the company.

 The company has also been accused of issuing a Rs 72-lakh work order to a Calcutta company for maintenance and operation of six power generating units and electrostatic precipitators. 

 The DPL management has cancelled the contract with the previous company unlawfully and engaged the new one at a higher rate. The management has given the work order to the company, which is charging at least Rs 20 lakh higher than the previous one. The management is keeping the power minister in the dark about its decisions, said Umapada Das, a committee member and general secretary of the DPLs Intuc-affiliated union.

 Both Citu, the CPMs labour arm, and Intuc, the Congresss labour wing, have demanded fresh tender notices for each of the two orders.

 The Burdwan district Citu vice-president and general secretary of the DPL union, Sukhen Sarkar, said the joint panel was needed to save DPL. 

 According to company rules, the management has to call open tenders by advertising in newspapers if the estimated cost of the work is more than Rs 5 lakh. This time, the management has given the work order of more than Rs 18 crore to a particular company without any tender notice in flagrant violation of rules. We will not tolerate such malpractice, said Sarkar. 

 We will investigate the work orders issued by the company and will expose the managements unholy alliance with a section of contractors, said a member of the DPL officers association.

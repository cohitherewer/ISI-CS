 Flood scare

 Calcutta, Oct. 20: With rain still lashing south Bengal, the situation in East Midnapore has turned flood-like.

 Vast tracts of the district are under water, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said.

 While most districts received over 100 mm of rain in the past 24 hours, South 24-Parganas and East Midnapore received about 150 mm, particularly in the coastal areas. Rural North 24-Parganas and the Barrackpore industrial area were waterlogged.

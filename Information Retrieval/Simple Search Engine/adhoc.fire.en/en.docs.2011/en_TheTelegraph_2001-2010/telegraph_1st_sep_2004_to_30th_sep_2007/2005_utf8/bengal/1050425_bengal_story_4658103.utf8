 CPM wins, almost

 - Trinamul gives in somewhere, fights battle within elsewhere

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, April 24: The CPM has virtually won a municipality in Nadia without a single vote being cast.

 The Trinamul Congress has not filed a single nomination for the 19 seats at Gayeshpur municipality, about 55 km from Calcutta, in protest against the ?CPM?s terror?.

 With about 20 other municipalities across the state, Gayeshpur is going to polls on May 22. Yesterday was the last day for filing nominations.

 Even if the Congress wins all eight seats which it is contesting, it will not wrest the civic body from the CPM.

 Trinamul sources said there was an unofficial understanding with the Congress that it would field 11 candidates and the Congress eight. 

 Kalyani subdivisional officer Swapan Paul, who is overseeing the Gayeshpur elections, said the last day for withdrawing nominations is April 27. That day, he will give certificates to the candidates who have won uncontested. 

 Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy said from Calcutta the CPM unleashes its ?reign of terror? in Gayeshpur ahead of every election. ?From the 2001 Assembly polls to last year?s Lok Sabha election, it has resorted to violence and rigging. The local administration helps the ruling party. That is why we have not fielded candidates there,? he said.

 Nadia Trinamul president Naresh Chaki said names of candidates for 11 seats had been declared. ?But the CPM cadre threatened them. They could not step out of their houses, forget electioneering. The administration did not pay any heed to our complaints.?

 District Congress chief Shankar Singh said Trinamul also wanted its candidates to pull out. ?But that would send a wrong signal to the people.?

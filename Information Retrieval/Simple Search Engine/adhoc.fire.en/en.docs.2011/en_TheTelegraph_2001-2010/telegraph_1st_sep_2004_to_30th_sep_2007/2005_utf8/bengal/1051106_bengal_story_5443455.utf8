 Nineteen in net for Kali Puja clash

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 5: Nineteen members of a club in Howrah were arrested late last night after a clash broke out between police and a crowd on its way to immerse an idol of Kali.

 According to the police, members of Belilious Tennis Club attacked a group of cops posted at the crossing of the busy Deshpran Sasmal Road and Narashingha Dutta Road under Bantra police station around 10.30 pm. 

 Members of the Bantra Police Station Puja Samannoy Committee, a body assigned to man traffic and people during the festive season, were on the job as processions of clubs from Shibpur, Jagachha, Kadamtala, Liluah and Bantra passed through the two roads on their way to the Hooghly.

 As they reached the crossing, the clubs members began squabbling over who would go first. 

 The police had to stop the processions coming along Deshpran Sasmal Road to clear the way for those passing through Narashingha Dutta Road. 

 A long queue of processions was waiting on Narashingha Dutta Road and traffic on the entire stretch had come to a standstill. So we decided to clear processions on that road, said an officer.

 Suddenly, a crowd charged at the policemen as thousands of people watched in horror. 

 Taking advantage of the chaos, somebody hit 68-year-old Nataraj Basu, the vice-president of the police- approved committee, on the head with a weapon. He dropped unconscious on the road and was taken to SSKM Hospital.

 A huge police team rushed to the spot as the crowd battled the cops. The police had to finally wield their lathis to disperse the mob. 

 We have arrested 19 people for harassing our personnel and creating law and order problems last night, said Akhil Kumar Roy, superintendent of police, Howrah.

 However, Belilious Tennis Club denied the charge. All the arrested 19 were from good families. One of them is a footballer with a first division team in Calcutta. Another is a state government employee. Attacking the police is the last thing they would do, said Gopal Patra, local councillor and president of the club.

 He pinned the blame on the police. They totally failed to manage the crowd. Our boys were beaten up and arrested. 

 A crowd of 800 gheraoed Bantra police station last night to protest against the arrests. Howrah Trinamul Congress president Arup Roy, central Howrah MLA Ambika Banerjee and Patra led the demonstration. 

 The gherao, which lasted till this afternoon, saw a replay of last nights incident with scuffles breaking out among the protesters and the police.

 The situation is under control now, the Howrah SP said.

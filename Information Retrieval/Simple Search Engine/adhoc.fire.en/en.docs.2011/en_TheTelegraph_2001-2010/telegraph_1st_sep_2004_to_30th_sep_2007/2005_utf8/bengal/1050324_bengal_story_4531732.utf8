 Hill CPM cries foul

 OUR BUREAU 

 March 23: Stung by the decision to appoint Subash Ghisingh the sole DGHC administrator, the hill CPM today blamed the Congress for ?forcing? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to give into the GNLF. 

 ?The Centre has politicised everything as the state government has approached the Prime Minister to take the decision. After all, in case of lawlessness in the hills, the Centre has to send paramilitary forces. The Centre has also been involved in the formation of the DGHC and also in the recent tripartite meetings?, said CPM?s Darjeeling district secretary S.P. Lepcha.

 He said Ghisingh was riding piggyback on the Congress, which was looking up to the GNLF to win the three Assembly seats in the hills next year. 

 The ?capitulation? to Ghisingh, as a CPM leader described the decision, has come as an embarrassment for the party, which carried out a long campaign against making the council boss the sole authority. 

 ?We have to look into the powers that Ghisingh will be given,? said Lepcha.

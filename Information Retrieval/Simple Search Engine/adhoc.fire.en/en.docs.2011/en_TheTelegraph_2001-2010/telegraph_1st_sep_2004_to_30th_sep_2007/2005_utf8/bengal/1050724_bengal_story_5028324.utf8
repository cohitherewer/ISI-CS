 CM turns to Pranab

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 23: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today called on defence minister Pranab Mukherjee at a city hotel where they were present this morning to address the 27th annual general body meeting of the Darjeeling-based Himalayan Mountaineering Institute.

 Mukherjee, the institutes president, and Bhattacharjee, the vice-president, discussed the infiltration of Bangladeshis and the spurt in Maoist activities, among other matters concerning the state, in the meeting that lasted for nearly half an hour.

 Bhattacharjee is learnt to have urged Mukherjee to take up the infiltration issue with the Centre and put an end to it. He also sought the Centres co-operation to deal with Maoists who have unleashed terror in Midnapore, Bankura, Purulia and parts of Burdwan.

 The Union minister refused to divulge details of the meeting, but sources said the chief minister also requested Mukherjee to ensure that the state Congress backs the West Bengal Block-level Pre-litigation Conciliation Board Bill, also known as the Salishi Bill, when it comes up for discussion at an all-party meeting slated for Monday.

 The state Congress has been opposing the bill though the Union law minister backed it at a seminar here. Atish Sinha, the chief of the Congress legislature party, has publicly said the party would oppose the bill as it would help the CPM recruit its own people in the proposed salishi board.

 The chief minister also requested Mukherjee to ensure central funds for construction of embankments to prevent erosion in Malda and Murshidabad districts.

 Mukherjee and Bhattacharjee also had a one-to-one discussion on the mountaineering institute. Mukherjee told the general body meeting that the institute has formulated a programme to train youths from Saarc nations.

 Todays executive meeting decided to form a small group to amend the constitution of the institute, which was drafted 51 years ago.

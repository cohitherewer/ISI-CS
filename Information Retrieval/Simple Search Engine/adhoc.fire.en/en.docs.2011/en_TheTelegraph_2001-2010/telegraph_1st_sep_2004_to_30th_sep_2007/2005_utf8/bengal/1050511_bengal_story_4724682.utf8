 University marks bounty

 Burdwan, May 10: The Burdwan University authorities today admitted negligence on the part of paper setters and announced ?compensation? for students who alleged that about a quarter of their questions in the BA Part-I examinations were out of syllabus.

 Examiners have been instructed to award 50 per cent marks to every student for attempting those questions. 

 About 3,000 students who took the universitys Bengali honours tests in April were asked to answer questions on topics not taught in class. Questions based on such topics were spread across all four papers they wrote.

 ?We are ready to compensate the examinees in every possible way so that they dont lose a year for not being able to answer the questions which were out of their syllabus,? said Sukumar Mukherjee, the varsitys deputy controller of examinations. ?We have given the necessary instructions to our examiners,? he added.

 ?Out of 400 marks, questions for about 100 were out of syllabus,? said an affected student.

 Registrar S.M. Dawn said the teachers responsible for setting the out-of-syllabus questions would be showcaused.

 Congress mulls HC move 

 OUR BUREAU

 Nov. 28: The Congress has decided to move high court praying for Chowdhurys bail.

 We have decided to take the matter to the high court, said Subrata Mukherjee, who today led a team of 18 party MLAs to a protest in Behrampore. Our course of action will be announced at a rally in Calcutta on December 3, he added.

 Until the party moves court, the agitation in support of the arrested MP will continue. 

 If we fail to bring Adhir out of jail, our supporters will start disobeying the leadership. Our party will face a difficult situation during the Assembly elections, Murshidabad Congress secretary Khairul Khondekar said. 

 Last year, the Congress won all three Lok Sabha seats in Murshidabad under Chowdhurys leadership. In 2003, the party won the zilla parishad for the first time and retained Behrampore municipality with a 23-0 sweep second time in a row. 

 The MP has been the district party chief since 2001. 

 A section of the party now believes that the CPM wants to hold Chowdhury in jail till the Assembly polls are over around mid-2006.

 Widening cracks in the Congress have made things relatively easy for the CPM. Of the eight Congress MLAs from Murshidabad, three ? Atish Sinha, Mayarani Pal and Niamat Seikh ? did not attend any of the three major rallies organised in Chowdhurys support.

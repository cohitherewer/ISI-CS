 Swapna Sardar was lying unconscious in the emergency ward of SSKM hospital on Saturday afternoon. She had suffered a severe head injury in a road accident on Diamond Harbour Road. 

 Mala Sarkar was fighting for life at the gynaecology emergency ward of Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital, where she had been referred from a Uttarpara hospital after bleeding profusely through the night. 

 Conditions of both women became far more critical than it should have been, thanks to the CPM?s rally at Brigade Parade Ground, crippling the city for hours. Many more patients headed for hospitals in the city from all parts of the state were caught for hours in the snarls caused by thousands marching to the Maidan to answer the call of their leaders. 

 All the main thoroughfares of the city were taken over by the red army ? even the no-pedestrian Gariahat flyover ? which advanced covering the entire width of roads, bringing traffic to almost standstill. Vehicles were barred from several roads as no-entry signs were put up to allow the rallyists to pass.

 ?It took us two-and-a-half hours to cross the AJC Bose Road flyover,? said Pradip Mitra, who was driving the ambulance carrying Swapna Sardar. 

 ?My aunt is in an extremely critical state and we requested the police to help but they could do nothing to make way for us,? said Raju Haldar. 

 Mala Sarkar of Konnagar was admitted in Uttarpara state general hospital after she bled profusely through the night. Her condition worsened and she was put in an ambulance and referred to a city hospital. They started at 11.30 am and reached the city at 2 pm. 

 ?Usually it takes 45 minutes but today we were stuck in a jam at the Dunlop crossing where the road was blocked by a procession,? said Tanmoy Dhara, driver of the ambulance. They were forced to make a detour as the road was again blocked by a procession at Sinthi More. After traversing through lanes and bylanes, the ambulance was again stuck in the rally jam at C.R. Avenue. 

 Thirteen-year-old Ganesh Kaibarta cried in pain as the ambulance carrying him was stalled for more than an hour just after crossing Vidyasagar Setu. The teen from Arambagh had injured his head after falling from a tree. He was being rushed to SSKM Hospital from Burdwan Medical College. 

 All the major junctions like Chowringhee, Moulali, AJC Bose Road-SP Mukherjee Road crossing, Shyambazar, Kidderpore, Park Circus, Mullick Bazar, and Gariahat witnessed snaking queues of vehicles. 

 The stretch from Maidan to Hazra, covering JL Nehru Road, Red Road, Mayo Road, AJC Bose Road, SP Mukherjee Road, Harish Mukherjee Road and Sarat Bose Road, were the worst affected. Buses and vehicles, carrying the comrades to Brigade were parked on AJC Bose Road, making it impossible to navigate. The rush of vehicles choked the flow of traffic on the flyover. 

 Hundreds of city-bound vehicles from Howrah were diverted through Foreshore Road to Howrah Bridge as vehicles began bunching up at the toll plaza on the Vidyasagar Setu. 

 More than 2,000 traffic police personnel were deployed to combat the situation. ?We had to divert traffic as some of the processions were very big,? said Arun Sharma, deputy commissioner, traffic. ?With millions of people entering the city, there is bound to be chaos,? he observed.

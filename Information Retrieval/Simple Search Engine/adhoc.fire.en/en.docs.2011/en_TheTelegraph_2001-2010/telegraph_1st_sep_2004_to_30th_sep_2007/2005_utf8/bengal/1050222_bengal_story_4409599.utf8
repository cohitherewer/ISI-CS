 Heat soars in steel city 

Engineering students raid hostel

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Feb. 21: Seven students of the National Institute of Technology (NIT), formerly Regional Engineering College, were arrested today for attacking an adjacent hostel of the private B.C. Roy Engineering College late last night. 

 Around 12.30 am, about a hundred NIT students armed with iron rods and hockey sticks barged into the hostel after overpowering its guards. The rooms were ransacked and the students beaten up. Their fault: asking some NIT students to leave a college soiree where they were behaving lewdly. 

 Burdwan police chief N.K. Singh confirmed the arrests. Pickets have been posted on both premises. 

 NIT director A.C. Ganguly promised exemplary action against the guilty students. He also wondered how they managed to step out of the campus at night, though guards are posted at the gates. 

 Sourav Mukherjee, a third-year B.C. Roy student who received 11 stitches on his hands and legs, said: ?We were tired after the soiree and fast asleep when they attacked us. I heard the sound of glass-panes being smashed and rushed out of my room to see what was happening. A group of youths pounced on me, used abusive words and started beating me up.? 

 His roommate, Rahul Sharma, has been admitted to the Durgapur Steel City Hospital with severe head injury. 

 The police reached the hostel about half-an-hour after the trouble broke out following a call from the assistant warden. 

 One of the B.C. Roy students said many of his junior mates are too scared to continue staying there.

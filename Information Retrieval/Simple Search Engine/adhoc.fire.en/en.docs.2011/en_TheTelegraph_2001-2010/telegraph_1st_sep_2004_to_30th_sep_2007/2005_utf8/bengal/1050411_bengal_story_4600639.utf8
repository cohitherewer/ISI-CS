 Mahajot gains ground

 - From north to south, Congress on alliance overdrive

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, April 10: A day after Mamata Banerjee ruled out an alliance with the Congress, till it shared power with the CPM at the Centre, Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi met A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury here to seek his blessings for a pact with the Trinamul Congress for the municipal polls.

 Das Munshi, who arrived this morning at the Kotwali residence of the Lok Sabha MP from Malda, remained closeted with Ghani Khan and his aides for 30 minutes. 

 Among others who attended the meeting were zilla parishad sabhadhipati Gautam Chakrabarty, district Congress president Rubi Noor, Kaliachak MLA A.H. Khan Chowdhury, Congress leader Phoni Roy and Malda Bar Association secretary Asit Bose. 

 ?I have known Priya as a good organiser for a long time. I have told him to decide whatever he thought was best. I am a soldier in the Congress and I will do whatever I am told in order to strengthen the party,? was all that Barkatda, as Ghani Khan is known in Malda, said after the meeting.

 Das Munshi, however, was clear about his stand. ?To take on the CPM in Bengal, there is no other alternative but to have an alliance with Trinamul. I have had talks with their leaders recently and told them the reality,? Das Munshi said.

 Calcutta mayor Subrata Mukherjee had made similar comments yesterday. 

 According to Das Munshi, Mamata was making ?a big mistake? in holding on to the National Democratic Alliance. The NDA has no future and the position of the Congress is totally different from what it was about five years ago, he claimed. 

 ?In Bengal, too, the Congress is a resurgent force and many Trinamul leaders have begun to contact us. Just wait for a fortnight and there will startling revelations,? the minister said.

 Without elaborating on the ?revelations?, Das Munshi predicted that ?plenty would happen? during the elections to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and 82 municipalities across the state.

 On the question of a mahajot (an alliance between the Congress and the Trinamul-BJP combine), he said: ?No party follows the prevalent political grammar as far as civic, panchayat and zilla parishad elections are concerned. In Malda, there is a panchayat samiti in Chanchol where the CPM is in power with the support of the BJP.?

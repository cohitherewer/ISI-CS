 Girl flees rapists

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Aug. 14: Nine months ago, Hamida Khatun (name changed) was taken to Delhi for marriage. 

 Last week, the 25-year-old returned to her house at Barua village in Beldanga, having fled from a brick kiln manager and his son in Uttar Pradesh who bought her from pimps and raped her for months. 

 Hamida was abducted by the pimps from Delhi station in front of her father Kalu Sheikh and sold off to a flesh racket in Punjab. Then she was resold to the brick kiln manager in Muzaffarnagar.

 Kalu, a small farmer, died days after returning to his village, about 180 km from Calcutta, unable to bear the shock. 

 Hamida, four months pregnant and suffering from anaemia and malaria, reached Beldanga on Wednesday. Last November, rickshaw-puller Heren Shah and his sister Ashia approached Kalu with the proposal for marriage. The would-be groom, they said, was Ashias brother-in-law.

 Five months ago, Ashia staged with her husband Arif a fake marriage with 16-year-old Firoza (not her real name). She then said he was her brother-in-law who lived in Uttar Pradesh. Heren was arrested and police rescued Firoza.

 Ashia told Kalu that her rich brother-in-law was in Delhi. On November 18, Kalu and his daughter, accompanied by Ashia, left for the capital. There, four men beat him up and took Hamida away. His efforts to locate her proved futile. 

 When Hamida, who hid herself in a burqa and escaped on the way to a doctor, returned home, she did not know that her father was dead. Arif raped me everyday before handing me over to touts of a Punjab brothel for 70,000. After 10 days with no food and a lot of beating, they returned me to Arif and Ashia. I was forced to sleep with many people. Early this year, they sold me to the brick kiln manager, Sheikh Zamiruddin, for Rs 20,000, she said. 

 District police chief N.K. Singh said: We will soon send a team looking for the couple.

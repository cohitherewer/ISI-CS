 Court opens boy exam door

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 18: The high court today asked the higher secondary council to issue an admit card to Sourav Jana, a daily wager?s son who could not pay the examination fee on time and was denied permission to take the tests.

 The student of Gokul Nagar Gobinda Jew Siksha Niketan at Nandigram in East Midnapore, 150 km from Calcutta, stood second in class in the last school examination.

 Often lending a hand to his father Satyasharan Jana, a mason?s helper, Sourav scored 622 in Madhyamik and ranked third in the Class XI finals. Throughout his school life, teachers paid his fees. But on January 31, the school clerk said he had to shell out over Rs 200 to appear in the HS. Sourav returned home.

 He was lucky to have worthy teachers and a matching headmaster. Coming to know about his plight, the school head paid his exam fee as well as a levy for being late. 

 But the council stuck to its deadline. And the teachers again rallied behind Sourav.

 They moved the high court. Justice Jayanta Biswas had asked the council to allow him to appear in the examination, but instead of carrying out the order, it challenged the verdict. A division bench of acting Chief Justice A.K. Ganguly and Justice T.K. Dutt today said: ?The office of the council in East Midnapore will have to issue an admit card to Sourav Jana on March 21, a day before the start of this year?s higher secondary examination.? 

 It is the second such case in recent times. Earlier, the court issued a similar directive when Malabika Konch of Bansdroni approached it after being denied an HS admit card for the same reason as Sourav.

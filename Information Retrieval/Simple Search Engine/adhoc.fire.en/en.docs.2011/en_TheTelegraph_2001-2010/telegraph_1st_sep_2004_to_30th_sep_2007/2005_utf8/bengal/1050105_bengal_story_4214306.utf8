 Unit split on Subhas 

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Behrampore, Jan. 4: CPM leaders of North 24-Parganas district appear divided on recommending a berth for transport minister Subhas Chakraborty in the CPM secretariat, the highest decision-making body in the state. 

 The issue will come up for discussion on Friday. Some CPM members indicated that chances of Chakraborty?s selection are bright, but insiders said a section of district leaders is in favour of Ranjit Mitra. 

 But the party has given Subhas a clean chit on his alleged connections with Dilip Banerjee alias Hatkata Dilip, accused of murdering two persons in North 24-Parganas.

 Govt reveals share shedding 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 11: The government plans to retain only a 10 per cent stake in Great Eastern Hotel after its ?strategic transfer?. 

 ?The hotel will continue to be of use to us even later. We are planning to retain a 10 per cent stake so that we have the power to intervene on some issues,? said commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen.

 With the marginal holding, the government, however, will not have an absolute say in its management.

 Sen said the structure of the organisation will be changed and a corporate entity formed. He added that it would not be possible to retain any of the 440 Great Eastern employees. 

 ?Neither the government nor the private partner would want to take the responsibility of staff salaries for about 18 months while the hotel is closed for renovation. Our officials have explained this to the hotel employees? unions, which wanted to see in writing the early retirement schemes we are offering.?

 The government has also finalised plans for three of its 10 sick public enterprises, which are part of the pilot restructuring project sponsored by the British Department for International Development.

 The government is giving up a majority shares of Angel India and West Bengal Chemical Industries to private partners, while the sick Krishna Silicate Glass will be shut down.

 Megatherm Electronics has been selected as partner for Angel India, which used to manufacture plastic moulding machines. ?The partner company has agreed to retain 20 of the 210 employees. The rest will be offered early retirement schemes,? the minister said. 

 Jairaj Commodities, a consortium of three firms, has agreed to take over West Bengal Chemical Industries and will retain 52 of its 103 employees. The government will retain 24 per cent stake in these companies and the veto power. 

 There were no takers for Krishna Glass Silicate. ?There was only one bidder for the company and its proposal was rejected as it did not meet our requirements,? said Sen. A decision is pending on the fate of Neo Pipes and Tubes, which employs about 100 people. 

 The minister of state for cottage and small-scale industries said plans are afoot to restructure Tantuja, Tantushree and Manjusha.

 Point taken: Ghisingh 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 28: Subash Ghisingh came out smiling after over two hours of talks with officials from the Union home ministry and the state government in North Block this evening, seemingly pleased with the outcome.

 Earlier this month, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee conceded the GNLF chief?s demand for ?tripartite? talks on the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, whose elections are due. 

 Today, Ghisingh said: ?Our primary demand was to strengthen the powers of the Gorkha hill council. I know that all this will take some time and more tripartite meetings would have to be held before the issue is settled.? However, no date has yet been fixed for the next round of talks.

 Some of the powers that had to be transferred by the state government to the hill council at the time of the tripartite agreement in 1988 have allegedly remained on paper. 

 The Gorkha leader did not spell out how the council had to be strengthened, but said the points he raised were noted and taken down by both state and central officials. 

 But by saying that more meetings were needed for the council to bag its dues, Ghisingh probably meant the polls could be postponed further. The third term of the council originally expired on March 26, 2004, after which it was extended twice till March 26, 2005. An ordinance will have to be issued to extend it further.

 In a letter to Manmohan Singh after he took over as Prime Minister, Ghisingh had raised the same issue. ?Even after 15 years of signing the accord, political, economical and social aspirations of the Gorkhas and other communities could not be fulfilled due to its half-done implementation, lack of sincerity of the signatories...? 

 Statehood to Gorkhaland also formed part of Ghisingh?s demands from Singh.

 The Gorkha leader, who helped the Congress win a Lok Sabha seat from the hills, is hoping to use the talks to wangle concessions from the Centre. The Congress is unlikely to fuel his hopes, considering that Left support is vital to its government. However, Ghisingh?s demand for more development funds is likely to be given. 

 Today, he had no harsh words for the state. Bengal officials said the meeting was ?extremely cordial?.

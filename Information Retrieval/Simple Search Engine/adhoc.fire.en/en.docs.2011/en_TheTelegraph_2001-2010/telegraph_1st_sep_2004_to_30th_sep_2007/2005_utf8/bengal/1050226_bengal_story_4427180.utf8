 Suicide bid after snub 

 Calcutta, Feb. 25: Hours before she was to appear for the first paper of her first major examination, Sunita Saha (name changed) was found unconscious in her room.

 The 16-year-old resident of Behala apparently tried to commit suicide by consuming sleeping pills after being scolded by her mother for neglecting studies. Her father died days before and the shradh was scheduled for today.

 Mother Anita, who repented having snubbed her, said she lost temper after she returned home late last night.

 Police said the girl got the pills from a local chemist for her mother, who has to take them regularly.

 School raid 

 Over 150 students and their guardians ransacked DL Alfanso School in Howrah and blocked roads after the high court barred them from taking the ICSE exam because the school did not have an affiliation.

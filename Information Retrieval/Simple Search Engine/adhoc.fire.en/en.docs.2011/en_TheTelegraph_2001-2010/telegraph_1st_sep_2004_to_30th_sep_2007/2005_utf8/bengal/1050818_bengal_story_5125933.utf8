 Meet on parallel court order 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 17: Muslim organisations in the state today held meetings to assess the impact of the Supreme Court admitting a petition against the parallel judicial system.

 The organisations said these disputes arbitration fora, like the Darul-ul Uloom which ordered Imrana to separate from her husband after being raped by her father-in-law, served a useful purpose in lessening the load of the judiciary.

 The Jamait-ul-Ulema-e-Hind today said Muslim courts are meant to serve the weaker sections of the society and to bring them redressal without having to go through the maze of legal complications.

 There are several instances where the court has taken 10 years to sort out a dispute over sharing of property among brothers. During each hearing, both parties have to be present in court and appoint lawyers. Many poor people avoid going to court as they cannot afford either the money or the time, said the general secretary of the Jamaits state unit, Moulana Siddiqullah Chowdhury. In our courts, we sort out the disputes quickly and for a fee of only Rs 300, he added.

 We have 500 judges across the state, who hold court once a week. They give their verdict after hearing both parties and conducting an independent inquiry, Chowdhury said, adding that his organisation entertained only civil matters like divorce, alimony, disputes over marriage, dowry and distribution of property.

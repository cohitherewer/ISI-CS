 VC charged with cheating

 Bolpur, March 23: The CID today filed chargesheets against former Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Dilip Sinha, math lecturer Mukti Deb and registrar Dilip Mukherjee.

 Sinha was arrested last June for attesting fake papers produced by Deb to secure the lecturer post. Sinha, the then VC, was the head of the interview board before which she had to appear. Today, the duo was charged with cheating, forgery and criminal conspiracy, along with the former registrar. All three are out on bail. 

 A CID deputy superintendent submitted the chargesheets at the Bolpur subdivisional judicial magistrate?s court.

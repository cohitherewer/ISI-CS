 Feluda former driver in net

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, March 12: On the basis of leads provided by Noor Baksh ? the 19-year-old domestic help who was shown the door a fortnight ago ? and his associate Ismail, policemen probing the heist at Soumitra Chatterjee?s house picked up Rajinder Mahato, his former driver, this afternoon. 

 A resident of Madhubani, Bihar, Mahato was introduced to the Chatterjees by an acquaintance. He was sacked recently following an altercation. 

 ?The arrest comes following leads thrown up by the two held last night. We are looking into Mahato?s role,? said Herman Preet Singh, the deputy inspector-general (Presidency range). An officer described Noor as a kleptomaniac and added that he and Ismail may have tipped off a bigger gang on the actor?s cash.

 Mahato was the third to be arrested within about 24 hours of the theft at Feluda?s residence. The actor, who made Satyajit Ray?s fictional private detective famous, and his family were asleep when burglars cleaned up about Rs 6 lakh in cash and valuables early yesterday morning. The police suspect an insider role in the job. 

 A team of officers led by deputy superintendent (town) Sumanjit Roy raided Mahato?s rented house at Regent Park around 4.30 pm and arrested him. He was taken to Jadavpur police station where senior officers grilled him, first individually and later in the presence of Noor and Ismail. 

 Mahato, who arrived in the city a few years ago, learnt driving from a maternal uncle.

 The actor?s wife, Deepa, told the police yesterday that the family had no clue about Mahato?s antecedents. He was recruited following a recommendation from a driver working for one of Chatterjee?s friends. 

 Mahato was with the Chatterjees for a month. 

 Earlier, a team led by South 24-Parganas additional superintendent H.K. Kusumakar grilled Noor and Ismail and fanned out to pockets of the district for night-long raids. Based on Ismail?s tip, a burglar was held at Canning and his associate from Bhangor.

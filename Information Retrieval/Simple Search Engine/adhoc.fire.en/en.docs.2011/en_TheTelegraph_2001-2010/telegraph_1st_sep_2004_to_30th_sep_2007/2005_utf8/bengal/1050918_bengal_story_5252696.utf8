 Family finds missing mum

 Calcutta, Sept. 17: For the Kundus, their mother has arrived ? over a fortnight before the Puja ? literally. 

 Almost a year after she went missing ? on Sasthi last year ? 55-year-old Minu Kundu was reunited with her family today. 

 Around 4.30 pm, she walked out of Liluah Home with her elder son Ratan, her fingers clinging on to his hands and eyes glistening. 

 In January, police rescued the resident of Kamrup in Assam from a roadside in Maniktala, weak, starved and somewhat deranged.

 I never thought Ill see my family again and cannot express my feelings?. I am tired. I want to go home, she said today before breaking down.

 At Khetri in Kamrup district, the Kundus were a happy family comprising a businessman, his wife, two sons and four daughters.

 Last year, during Durga Puja, Minu went to visit her sister in Guwahati and lost her way on the way back. Her family frantically searched for her, but in vain. 

 On the night of January 1, a Calcutta police patrol van attached to the Burtolla police station found her unconscious near the Maniktala crossing. She had been hit by a car. 

 She was admitted to the nearby ESI Hospital, where she was treated for her injuries and diagnosed with mental illness. 

 She was weak because of prolonged starvation. She could not tell anything about herself or her residence, said Gautam Dey, the sub-inspector who found her. A court later told the police to send her to the Liluah home. 

 At the home, with the help of a mental health association, she regained sense and was able to reveal her identity. 

 When we first visited Minu Kundu, her condition was critical. She had started to suffer from insomnia and turned violent at times. After months of treatment and counselling, she improved. A couple of months ago, she was able to tell us where her real home was, said Pratibha Sengupta, the principal psychologist of Sane and Enthusiastic Volunteer Association. 

 The organisation then wrote to the Kundus. 

 Her son Ratan today said: Even when we first received the letter, we did not believe that we will ultimately find our mother. We had almost lost hope?. For us Mother Durga has already arrived.

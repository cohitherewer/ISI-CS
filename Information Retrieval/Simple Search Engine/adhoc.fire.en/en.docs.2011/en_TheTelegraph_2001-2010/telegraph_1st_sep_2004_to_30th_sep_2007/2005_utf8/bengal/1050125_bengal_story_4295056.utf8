 Buddha backs farm takeover for industry 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 24: Conversion of agricultural land for industrialisation would continue regardless of opposition from sections of the CPM and its partners, the chief minister said today. 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told party colleagues on the concluding day of the CPM?s South 24-Parganas district conference that there is no other option before the government but allowing such conversion in the interest of the overall development of Bengal.

 Responding to criticism from the party?s district unit, Bhattacharjee also made it clear that Bengal?s development was his top priority. ?We will have to accept the fact that some agricultural land will have to be converted to accommodate new industrial units. We need this conversion because we need more industries,? Bhattacharjee said.

 His government has had to bear the brunt of criticism since the party conference began on Saturday, especially for allowing real estate development on agricultural land in the district. 

 Bhattacharjee was also criticised by his party?s Calcutta district committee last week for allegedly focusing more on the city?s development, which ?benefits only the affluent.?

 The chief minister today reiterated that his government would have to accept funds from capitalists because its own resources are limited. ?If entrepreneurs come to us with bags full of money, should we refuse them?? he asked the district leaders, some of whom had questioned the government?s pro-industry line, which ?favours? industrialists.

 ?You have to allow them (industrialists) to make profit. Why should they come here if they do not see any prospect for profit?? he asked. ?Evictions will be made in the interest of development and industry,? he said, adding that none of it would be without alternative arrangements in place.

 At the end of the three-day meet, district secretary Santimoy Bhattacharjee, a hardliner, retained his position in the 82-member committee. Gokul Bairagi, who used to be Jyoti Basu?s election agent, was dropped from the panel.

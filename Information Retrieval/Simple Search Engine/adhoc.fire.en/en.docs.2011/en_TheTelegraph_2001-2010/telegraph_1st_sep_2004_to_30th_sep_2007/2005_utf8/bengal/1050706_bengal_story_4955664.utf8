 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, July 5: State labour minister Mohammad Amin today told the Assembly that the Centre has decided to close down three jute mills in the state.

 Replying to a question by Samsul Islam Mollah of CPM, Amin said the central government runs five jute mills in Bengal, three of which will be closed down in a phased manner. Of the 67 jute mills in the state, nine have been facing closure over the past one year, he added.

 Calcutta: The 2906 Up Howrah-Porbandar Express will remain cancelled on July 8 from Howrah, South Eastern Railway officials said. This was because the 2905 Down Porbandar-Howrah Express from Porbandar would be cancelled because of floods in Gujarat. The 8034 Up Howrah-Ahmedabad Express will remain cancelled from Howrah on Wednesday because of cancellation of corresponding down trains from Ahmedabad.

 Behrampore: Two persons were killed and another seriously injured when the bike they were riding hit a wall of a house near Khagra in Behrampore town, 200 km from Calcutta, on Monday night. The deceased have been identified as Shib Das, 20, and Raju Das, 21.

 Calcutta: Five trucks with goods and a building were gutted in a fire at the Bongaon-Petrapole border on Tuesday afternoon. The cause of the fire was not known, but a short circuit was probably one of the reasons, fire brigade officials said.

 Calcutta: The government has revised the wages of bidi workers from Rs 37.20 for preparing 1,000 bidis to Rs 41 per 1,000 bidis.

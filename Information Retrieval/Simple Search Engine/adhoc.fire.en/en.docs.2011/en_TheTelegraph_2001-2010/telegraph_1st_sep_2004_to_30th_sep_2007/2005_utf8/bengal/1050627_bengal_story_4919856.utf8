 Left meet for seal on Bikash

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 26: The Left Front has called a meeting tomorrow to formally ratify Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya as mayor and nominate members from its constituents for the mayors council.

 The meeting may witness the CPM asking for the deputy mayors post, for which the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) has already staked its claim, sources said. The RSP, which improved its tally getting six councillors, had also demanded the key post at a meeting with CPM leaders.

 The Forward Bloc feels that it has a strong case for the chairmans post besides two mayor-in-council members. We shall discuss everything threadbare tomorrow in the Front meeting, said Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh.

 In a related development, five councillors of Subrata Mukherjees Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress have decided to back Trinamul Congress if it fields a nominee as the mayoral candidate against Bhattacharya. At a meeting last night, we decided to back a Trinamul nominee as a candidate for mayor despite our differences with (Trinamul) party chief Mamata, said Mainul Haque Chowdhury, who was a member of former mayor Subrata Mukherjees council. Haque was elected from ward 141 this time.

 The Congress will decide its course of action early next week. PCC working president Pradip Bhattacharya said on certain issues party councillors would join hands with Trinamul.

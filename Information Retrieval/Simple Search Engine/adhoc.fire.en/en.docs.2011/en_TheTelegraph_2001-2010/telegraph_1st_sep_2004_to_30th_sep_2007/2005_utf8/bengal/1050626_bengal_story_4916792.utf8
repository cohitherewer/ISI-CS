 Calcutta, June 25: A month after realtor Sushil Saha was shot dead in front of his house at Baguiati, his wife and her promoter friend were arrested today for plotting the murder and supervising the killing.

 Police said Rina Saha, 45, had strained relations with her husband and a steady one with Moloy Majumder, 42. 

 They wanted to get rid of Saha as early as possible so that they could gain access to his bank accounts and settle down together in life, said Praveen Kumar, the North 24-Parganas superintendent of police. 

 On May 21, Saha, 50, had barely stepped out of his home at Vidyasagar Pally when two youths walked up and pumped three bullets into him. 

 A reconstruction of the crime revealed how the two men, later identified as Bhola and Bunty, had been waiting outside Sahas house for hours, aware that he would come out for his daily afternoon stroll.

 They had nearly missed the target as he did not spend much time outside. They first shot him in the back, seconds before he entered the house. Another youth pulled the trigger aiming at Sahas right temple while the third bullet damaged his kidneys, said an officer on the case. 

 On May 16, the police got a vital breakthrough in local tough Bhola, who confessed to being one of the killers. His partner Bunty was then held from Dum Dum Park. He told the police that they were paid Rs 1 lakh to carry out the murder by none other than Sahas wife and her friend. We were told everything about Sushil Sahas routine and fixed up a date to eliminate him accordingly, Bunty told the police.

 Rina and Moloy were picked up from the Baguiati area early today. The police said she confessed to her guilt and agreed to turn an approver in the case. Moloy paid the killers, she apparently told the police. 

 Later in the day, Rina made a confessional statement in front of a magistrate. The police said she knew Moloy for the past five years.

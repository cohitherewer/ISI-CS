 Dogs dig out dead girl

 Calcutta, Nov. 25: Stray dogs tugging to a dupatta that they got hold of after scooping out earth led to the find of a teenagers body at Usthi in South 24-Parganas today.

 Police, who suspect a rape-murder, have sent the girls body, buried in a field 60 km from Calcutta, for post-mortem.

 A resident of Ujirberia village said foul smell was emanating when the dogs were pulling at the cloth, but none dared to see what it was. The dogs finally exposed the body.

 Early this month, dogs had dug out the body of a seven-year-old girl with her hands chopped off at nearby Sonarpur. District police chief S.N. Gupta today said: We have come to know her identity and will soon pick up her killer.

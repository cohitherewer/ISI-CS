 Decision on HS split by July

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 11: The decision on splitting the higher secondary course and holding the plus II examination only on the Class XII syllabus will be finalised this month itself, school education minister Kanti Biswas said in the Assembly today. 

 The minister has convened a meeting with various teachers bodies, academics and officials on July 20 to discuss the modalities for implementing the decision. If the discussions move in the right direction, we will be able to implement the new system from the current academic session, Biswas told reporters later.

 The move comes in the wake of the recent Supreme Court directive to school boards that plus II examination results will have to be declared by June 10 every year. 

 It is not difficult for most boards in the country, including the Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations and the Central Board of Secondary Education, to conform to the June 10 deadline as they have already introduced the system of covering the Class XII syllabus in the final examination. 

 The splitting of the course will expedite the process of publication of HS results as the volume of answer scripts will automatically be reduced, the minister explained.

 However, Biswas said, though most other boards have also begun holding the tenth standard examination on the basis of the Class X syllabus, Madhyamik will continue to cover the syllabi for classes IX and X. 

 The government, he said, has chalked out a comprehensive plan for the extension of computer education in schools. The school education minister met infotech minister Manab Mukherjee today and discussed how to go about implementing the plan. We will soon float an open tender for supplying computers to schools so that they are equipped with the machines from this academic session, he said.

 Students from the economically weaker sections will be offered free computer education. The rest will have to pay extra for it.

 The school education minister also told the Assembly that the government had finalised its decision to introduce life style education for students in their adolescence. It is such an age when a student, whether a boy or a girl, goes through several changes. They have to be educated about these changes, he said, adding that it did not amount to the conventional sex education. 

 There will be no books, syllabi or examinations. Instead, the subject will be taught through interactive sessions with the students, Biswas said. Boys and girls will be taught in separate rooms. If necessary, lady teachers will train the girls and male teachers will deal with the boys, he added.

 Life style education was recommended 

 by a committee led by Ranjugopal Mukhopadhyay set up by 

 the government to review school syllabi.

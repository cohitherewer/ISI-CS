 Punishment cry for river traffic rogues

 A ship on the Hooghly: Mind the intruders

Calcutta, June 25: A day after MV Moni got stuck in the underbelly of the Howrah bridge trying to sneak under it, Calcutta Port Trust called on law-enforcing agencies to put an end to the menace of barges flouting river traffic rules.

 Though MV Moni had valid papers, it was crossing the bridge during high tide, which a vessel of its size was not supposed to do.

 At various meetings held recently, we have expressed concern about unlicensed vessels entering the navigational channel without valid documents. It is time to put an end to the menace or else the Calcutta port will suffer a heavy loss. Imagine one of the barges ramming into a ship during peak hours, port trust chairman A.K. Chanda said.

 The 232 km-long Kidderpore-Sandhead route has for the past few years been used by a large number of vessels without any permit, forcing the authorities to call for action against the barge owners. The manner in which the inland vessels intrude into the ocean channel, a disaster is inevitable. A small boat can cause considerable damage and stall the Calcutta ports operations completely, said Chanda.

 Senior port trust officials will hold meetings with all statutory bodies, including the state transport department, the Inland Waterways Authority of India and the barge operators associations, to address the problem. 

 They should all be accountable for the smooth sailing of vessels through the channel and also into the Hooghly beyond Howrah bridge, said a senior port trust officer.

 However, Inland Waterways Authority of India officials said the ball is in the port trusts court as it is the custodian of the channel. Along with the state government, they should ensure that no unlicensed barge sneaks into the channels waters. The Calcutta Port Trust can implement the laws and nobody is stopping it from doing that, a senior waterways authority official said.

 The port trust has asked for exemplary punishment for all violators. An example must be set so that others are careful before violating rules and entering the bridge area at the wrong time, Chanda said.

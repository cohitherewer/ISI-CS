 Haldia calling all investors

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Nov. 9: The 

 bid to hardsell Haldia as an investment destination is on 

 an overdrive with an investors meet lined up at the 

 port town tomorrow. 

 Around 220 representatives from 145 firms in India, besides three countries ? the US, France and Australia ? will participate in Haldia Calling, being organised by the Haldia administration and the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII). 

 Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra and IT minister Manab Mukherjee will also be present along with US consul general in Calcutta Henry V. Jardine, who is the guest of honour. 

 Our aim is to project Haldia as an investment destination. We want to convince investors that the place is suitable for a wide range of investments, chairman of the CIIs Bengal council Biswadip Gupta said.

 He added that the invitees are from 15 different sectors, including manufacturing, infrastructure, retail, healthcare, education, tourism, IT and IT-enabled services. Representatives of banks and financial institutions would also attend the meet.

 Although some big industries have come up in Haldia, we want to point out that there are plenty of other areas in this port town for investment like healthcare, education, transport, entertainment and tourism. We will inform the prospective investors about availability of land and facilities. We will reply to all kinds of questions regarding infrastructure like power and water supply, said Surendra Gupta, the chief executive officer of the Haldia Development Authority.

 He said special emphasis is being laid on infrastructure. With development of industry in Haldia, we need to have better infrastructure like more schools and hospitals. Senior officials of various companies are staying in Haldia and would like to have good hospitals and schools around. 

 Haldia administration officials said the industrial units in the town, 135 km from Calcutta, were mostly engaged in bulk production. So we have to develop a retail market, an official said.

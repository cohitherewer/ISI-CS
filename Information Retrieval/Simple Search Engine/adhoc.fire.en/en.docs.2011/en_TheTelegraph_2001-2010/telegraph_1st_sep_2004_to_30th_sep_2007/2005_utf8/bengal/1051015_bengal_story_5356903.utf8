 Tough talk amp; talks to lift Salim blocks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 14: The administration will take care of Trinamul Congress workers if they create trouble on October 20 when Salim Group boss Benny Santoso arrives here, the state CPM secretary said today.

 Anil Biswas was reacting to Mamata Banerjees threat to block all entry points to the city that day to protest against the governments decision to hand over farmland to the Indonesia-based conglomerate for setting up industry.

 This (blocking Santosos way) is in bad taste. The administration will step in if any untoward incident takes place, Biswas warned, adding that the CPM would not deploy its cadre on the road.

 Those who are talking about the agitation on October 20 do not want the states development. How can they talk about farmers welfare if they do not want them to prosper? he asked. 

 Party insiders said the Salim projects figured in todays CPM secretariat meeting, which preceded the day-long session of the state committee tomorrow. 

 Biswas said the party would again meet representatives of other Left Front partners to ward off possibility of any further problem regarding the Salim projects. We shall convene a front meeting by October 21 before beginning bilateral talks with each of them.

 The allies and a section of the CPM had opposed the transfer of agricultural land for industry and accused chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee of keeping them in the dark about the Salim Groups inve-stment plans.

 Officials at Writers Buildings indicated that Bhattacharjee might call an all-party meeting to ensure smooth implementation of the Salim projects.

 Trinamul leaders said they were not averse to talks with the chief minister. We must know what the projects are all about, said Shobhandeb Chattopadhyay, the partys chief whip in the Assembly and legislator from Rashbehari. 

 Chattopadhyay also said that Trinamul would place an alternative proposal before the government on acquisition of land for the projects. We are not opposed to industrialisation. But the government could acquire the 51,000 acres on which closed industries are located, he added.

 State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said former party chief Somen Mitra had requested Bhattacharjee last month to convene an all-party meeting to discuss the Salim projects. 

 Biswas, however, denied knowledge of any such proposal. Asked if there was such a possibility, he said: Let them first ask for a meeting. Then the government might consider it.

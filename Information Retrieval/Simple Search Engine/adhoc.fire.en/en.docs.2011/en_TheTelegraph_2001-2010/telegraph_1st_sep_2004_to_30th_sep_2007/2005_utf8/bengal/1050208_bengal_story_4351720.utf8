 A border guard: Not alone for long

 Feb. 7: The Border Security Force will set up a volunteer brigade with the help of villagers along the Bangladesh border to stem smuggling and infiltration. 

 BSF officials said the exercise, beginning with Murshidabad and Nadia, would be taken up in all border districts later. Bengal shares a 2,400-km border with Bangladesh, which includes 220 km of Nadia and 105 km of Murshidabad.

 In about a month, almost 450 people ? jobless youths with some education aged between 20 and 35 ?will be recruited to set up the Village Volunteer Force. They will be split up in groups of 15 and ?will assist our officers and jawans to identify infiltrators and give us information on rackets helping those trying to cross the border to Bengal illegally?, said a BSF officer. He added: ?Our jawans often do not pick up the accent of those coming in from Bangladesh and cannot distinguish them from those living in Bengal.?

 BSF personnel on border patrol are often given a crash course in Bengali, but ?it is still difficult to identify the various accents?.

 R.C. Saxena, the BSF deputy inspector-general in the Krishnagar sector, said five battalions guarding the border in Nadia would be assisted by the new force. ?This will be a value addition. In the border villages, there are a number of youths, who are educated but jobless. Our move will help them earn some money,? he added. 

 Candidates who have cleared Madhyamik will get preference, said an office. The volunteers are likely to be paid between Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 a month, according to performance. 

 The DIG of the Behrampore sector, M.A. Salek, said in the first phase in Murshidabad, volunteers selected from 10 villages will undergo training.

 Teesta accused dies in hospital

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jalpaiguri, July 8: An engineer in the irrigation department arrested in the Rs 4-crore Teesta barrage scam died this morning at a hospital, triggering a blame game between health officials and jail staff. 

 Officials at the Jalpaiguri Central Jail, where Arunodoy Banerjee was lodged, refused comment on what caused the delay in bringing the prisoner to the district hospital. K.K. Karmakar, the acting superintendent of the hospital, said: He died soon after he was admitted here. We hardly got any chance to treat him. 

 The 57-year-old executive engineer working out of Sech Bhavan in Salt Lake, Calcutta, was picked up along with 11 colleagues last week for alleged misappropriation of funds meant for the Teesta project. 

 Banerjee, who was in judicial custody, died this morning at the Jalpaiguri hospital, reportedly within a few minutes of admission. 

 He was a diabetic and was suffering from cardiac and respiratory problems. This morning, he was brought to the hospital but died a few minutes later. The doctors did not get any chance to treat him, said Bhusan Chakrobarty, the chief medical officer of health, Jalpaiguri.

 Another accused engineer, Byomkesh Guha Neogi, who was arrested from South 24-Parganas, was rushed in from Jalpaiguri Central Jail later in the day. He, too, was suffering from uneasiness in the chest.

 You must find out why all of us were arrested for no reason at all. The truth is different, was all that Guha Neogi could say before he was taken inside.

 Bhattacharjee: Caring face

 Calcutta, May 25: After pursuing a contractual recruitment policy over the past few years, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government has decided to add to it a human touch and also to offer preferential treatment to daughters of soil in nursing.

 The cabinet, which met for over an hour today, decided to follow a Bhoomikanya policy in nursing. 

 The governments contract system as well as increasing recruitment of nurses from other states by health centres across Bengal had faced flak at the state CPM conference earlier this year.

 The chief minister today expressed concern over private hospitals roping in nurses from outside and suggested to health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra that they be asked to recruit 50 per cent of their staff from among those who pass out of nursing institutes here.

 If we are issuing these nursing homes licenses and clearances, it is their obligation towards this state, he said.

 Not all government employees would be hired on contract, he added.

 While considering regularisation of casual workers in group-D posts and sweepers at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, RG Kar and North Bengal Medical College and Hospitals, the cabinet today deliberated at length on the contract policy. 

 At the meeting, power minister Mrinal Banerjee pointed out that contract workers had performed much better in security services than the governments permanent personnel. Some of the ministers also suggested that the government hire only contract workers in the group-D category. 

 If they deliver, they might be retained, if they dont, they may be fired, said one.

 The chief minister, however, took exception to this. The phrase, hire and fire, relates to the corporate sector. Lets not use their jargon, he said. 

 Bhattacharjee suggested the government would take a balanced view ? employees would be taken on contract only in certain sectors. In vital sectors, we may recruit less people but they will be permanent staff. We will provide them all benefits, he said. 

 What vital sectors implied was not clear, though. 

 The chief minister also promised fixed pay for part-time college teachers. Ill make provision for that, Bhattacharjee told cabinet colleagues.

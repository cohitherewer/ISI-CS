 Widow wins pension claim

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 14: Calcutta 

 High Court today directed the state education department 

 to give family pension to the widow of Satchidanada Chatterjee, 

 who retired from a Burdwan school in 1961 and died 30 years 

 later.

 Justice Girish Guptas ruling came after the authorities of Susunia Ranibala Vidyamandir in Burdwan, about 90 km from Calcutta, submitted an audit report on the period Chatterjee had taught in the school. 

 This audit report is enough to prove that the teacher concerned had served the school till 1961. So, the District Inspector (DI) of schools in Burdwan is directed to issue the family pension to the widow within eight weeks, the order said.

 In 1981, the state government had decided that family pension would not be awarded to teachers who retired before 1980. The government revised its decision in 1990.

 A year after her husbands death, Subhadra applied to the Burdwan DI for family pension. But he told her that the school authorities had failed to produce documents relating to her husbands employment. So he could not give her family pension.

 Subhadra then knocked on the doors of different offices of the education department. When nothing worked, she moved the high court in May this year.

 Justice Gupta had earlier directed the DI to file an affidavit clarifying why he did not pay family pension to the widow. 

 The DI informed the court that he had sent intimations to the school asking for the necessary documents. But the school authorities are saying that all the documents have been damaged, he said.

 When the judge asked the school managing committee to file a report stating its stand on the district inspectors allegation, it submitted the audit reports, which clinched the case in Subhadras favour.

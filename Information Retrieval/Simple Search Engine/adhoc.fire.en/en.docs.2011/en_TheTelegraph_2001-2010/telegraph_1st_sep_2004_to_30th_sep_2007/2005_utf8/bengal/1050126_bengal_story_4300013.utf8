 Spurned, girl hires killers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Jan. 25: Anamika Malakar, a teenager, was arrested today for allegedly hiring goons to kill a man who spurned her. 

 Debashis Sarkar, 30, was called out of a hall where his wedding reception was being held on Sunday night by unknown youths and hacked to death. Police said the murder in Katwa, Burdwan, 180 km from Calcutta, was ?an act of vengeance? after Sarkar rejected the schoolgirl?s marriage proposal. ?She engaged assassins to kill him,? said a Katwa police station officer.

 Anamika was picked up early this morning from her home at Madhabitala in Katwa.

 District superintendent of police N.K. Singh confirmed the arrest. ?We?ve got proof of Anamika?s involvement in the murder. We are looking for the people she engaged to commit the crime,? he said.

 Neighbours said Sarkar, who used to work out at a gymnasium, came to know his friend?s sister Anamika about a year ago. She apparently proposed to him several times, but was refused. 

 A grocery owner, Sarkar tied the knot with Mou Pal on January 21. Mou is now in shock and being treated at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital.

 Around 8 pm on Sunday, the trio called him to a garden outside Shishmahal Lodge for some ?confidential talk?. About two hours later, he was found in a pool of blood.

 10 questions that keep the case boiling

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Feb. 5: Chayan Mukherjee, the inspector-general in charge of law and order, said this morning that Roma Jhawar?s kidnapping was an ?open-and-shut? abduction case. But a veil of mystery refuses to lift on the 15-hour (official estimate) kidnap drama. 

 There are inconsistencies in the statements issued by the police and the family, with the two often contradicting each other. 

 The first question is regarding the time Roma 

came home. Police claim to have rescued the Srimati J.D. Birla Institute student 

at 11.30 last night from Phoolbagan and reached her home an hour later. But the 

family says they got the information around 3 am on Saturday. Why is the Jhawars? 

lawyer claiming she was picked up from Kankurgachhi only this morning? 

 According to the police, residents of Phoolbagan 

had helped the 70-member searching team. Police said they found Roma near a roadside 

motor repairing garage. How come none of the residents spotted the girl and they 

haven?t said a word about the operation to anyone? 

 Mukherjee, the officer in charge of law and 

order, said Roma was found ?standing? near the garage. She was drowsy and couldn?t 

speak much. It raises two questions. How was she able to stand in such a condition? 

Why didn?t the abductors ?drop her off? in a less crowded place, a move that would 

have given them more time to make a getaway? 

 Why did the abductors remain so close to Salt 

Lake ? where Roma lived ? till late in the night despite abducting her in the 

morning? Why didn?t they put some distance between them and the police? 

 Police claimed to have zeroed in on the spot 

from where she was rescued sometime ago. Why was Roma spotted alone? Despite keeping 

an eye on the place, why did the police fail to get hold of the car or any of 

the kidnappers? 

 Mukherjee said Roma could give police a single-line 

statement after being rescued. ?I was given some curd to eat in the afternoon.? 

Around 1 pm, Mukherjee said in his briefing that police could not query her as 

the abductors had put a high dose of sedatives in the curd and doctors asked them 

not to disturb her before evening. Only two hours later, Roma entered Bhawani 

Bhavan with sister-in-law Sunita. She appeared fine, walking on her own without 

any help. How was this possible? 

 Mukherjee claimed that the Jhawars did not 

pay ransom and the abductors fled leaving Roma behind, fearing police action. 

The miscreants carried out the abduction neatly and avoided the police successfully 

through the day. What could have scared the abductors in the middle of the night 

to abruptly end a seemingly successful operation and allow their quarry to go 

home? 

 If the police had rescued her at 11.30 last 

night and everything was fine, why did they need to interrogate four youths, friends 

of Roma, at Bhawani Bhavan till 3 am this morning? 

 If the kidnapping is an ?open-and-shut case?, 

as claimed by the police, why did the police top brass feel it necessary to start 

checking Roma?s computer with such urgency on Saturday evening? 

 Roma is said to have been traced by 11.30 

pm. But local MP Amitava Nandy turned up at the Jhawar residence much after that. 

If there was a sigh of relief among police and other senior officials, why did 

the MP feel the urgency to turn up at that hour of the night? Was Roma really 

tracked down by then?

 Alipurduar, Feb. 2: The late cold spell this winter has attracted more migratory birds to Rasikbeel, raising the spirits of nature lovers in the region.

 During its annual census carried out between January 14 to 16, members of the Himalayan Nature and Adventure Foundation (HNAF) counted over 4,500 waterfowl, raptors and other birds at the ox-bow lake, located in Cooch Behar district, around 28 km from here. 

 What surprised the census team was several first-time sightings this year.

 According to Animesh Bose, the programme coordinator of the HNAF, birds like the little tern, spot-billed duck, Brahminy kite, Pallas? fishing eagle and osprey, another raptor, were sighted.

 ?The bird count last year stood at around 3,500. This year, the higher number is encouraging,? Bose said. ?Other local species like the racquet-tailed drongo and lesser hornbill were also spotted.?

 ?Considering the size of the lake and the large volume of water, it should be one of the best birding sites in the state. However, there exist some problems which can threaten the future of Rasikbeel and its birds,? Bose said.

 He pointed out that around 150 people indulge in ?uncontrolled? fishing in the 178-hectare wetland. 

 Other threats to the avifauna of the area are trapping of birds for food. ?During the census, we rescued three sandpipers trapped in a net and we released them around 28 km from here after administering first aid,? Bose said.

 The other factor that might keep away the birds is the indiscriminate use of loudspeakers by picnickers. 

 Bose suggested to forest officials workshops to make the local youths aware of the bird life and discourage anything that night scare them away. 

 The forest department also promised to prevent illegal and indiscriminate fishing.

 Calcutta, May 29: Life-term convict Debasish Chakraborty, who had escaped from Midnapore Central Jail on Friday night, was arrested this afternoon from Nalgari village in the Nodakhali area of South 24-Parganas, 20 km from Calcutta.

 Debasish is alleged to have links with Aftab Ansari, the prime accused in the American Center attack case, and Sajal Barui, a murder accused.

 The 24-year-old convict, sentenced to life for murdering his girlfriend and attempting to kill his mother, had used scraps of iron to dig a tunnel through the floor of the jails toilet. He then climbed over the boundary wall with the help of logs and a rope.

 Debasish fled to his maternal uncles house yesterday. Acting on a tip-off, the police surrounded the house of Himangshu Chakraborty, his uncle, and the convict surrendered without putting up any resistance, said Joydeb Chakraborty, inspector-general (prisons).

 During interrogation, Debasish said he first went to Midnapore railway station. From there, he walked up to Kharagpur and boarded a train for Howrah. But he got off the train before Howrah and walked to the banks of Hooghly to take a ferry to Burulghat in Nodakhali. When we went to arrest him, we found him watching TV, said a police official.

 South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S.N. Gupta said Debasish was sent back to Midnapore Central Jail tonight, escorted by a team of policemen from West Midnapore. 

 He will be produced before a Midnapore court tomorrow, Gupta added. 

 When he escaped, Debasish was wearing a lungi and vest. Today, he was in a Bermuda and denim shirt.

 After Debasish, a resident of Uluberia in Howrah, was arrested in 1999 and sentenced, he was lodged in Presidency Jail. There, he reportedly helped smuggle in a cellphone for Aftab Ansari. Debasish was shifted to Midnapore on March 19 this year.

 The IG (prisons) said three warders of Midnapore Central Jail have been suspended for dereliction of duty.

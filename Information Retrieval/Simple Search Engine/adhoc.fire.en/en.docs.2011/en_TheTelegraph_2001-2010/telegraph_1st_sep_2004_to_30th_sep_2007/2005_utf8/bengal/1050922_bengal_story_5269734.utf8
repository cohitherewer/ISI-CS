 Calcutta, Sept. 21: Residents of Gas Street in central Calcutta bid a tearful goodbye today to one of its sons who once rejected a cushy job, joined the police force and rose to become additional superintendent of police.

 The body of Mushtaq Ahmed, the Kalimpong ASP who died following the mob attack in Cooch Behar yesterday, was brought to Calcutta this afternoon by an Indian Airlines flight. His son and wife were also on the plane.

 At the airport police station ground, top officers of Bengal police paid tributes to their slain colleague. The coffin was draped in the national flag.

 With a bugle sounding a farewell tune, 20 constables of the Barrackpore First Battalion of the Rapid Action Force offered a guard of honour.

 We are with you. Try to console your mother, said DGP S.C. Avasthy to Ishthaque Ahmed, 18, the only son of the slain police officer. Ishthaque, a student of Class XII at a Kalimpong school, was still in a daze.

 The arrival of the coffin of their beloved Mushtaq bhai brought several neighbours to the small house at 3B/H/1 Gas Street where the ASP once lived. This (the small building) is because he was an honest police officer, said S. Siddiqui, a friend of Mushtaq.

 He got a job with public health engineering but rejected it and took the West Bengal Police Service examination to serve his country, he added.

 Officers of Bengal police and Calcutta police paid tributes to their slain colleague at his residence.

 Biman pact barb at rivals

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 15: Left Front chairman Biman Bose today accused the Trinamul Congress-BJP combine and the Congress-led United Democratic Alliance of forging a secret understanding in the run-up to the June 19 civic elections. 

 The Opposition here is not as fractured as it appears to be. They have united to take on the Front nominees, forsaking all their political ideologies, he told a news conference this afternoon.

 Bose alleged that in large parts of south Calcutta, candidates from the two fronts are not campaigning against each other following an adjustment. Though they have apparently fielded candidates against each other, they have a secret electoral understanding to ensure our defeat.

 A week ago, the Front had issued a three-page leaflet apprehending that its rivals, desperate to capture the civic board, may join forces.

 Bose, however, said that despite all Opposition efforts, the Left is confident of winning in over 50 per cent of 141 wards across the city.

 Salve on Great Eastern staff

 BARUN GHOSH

 Calcutta, March 9: With the employees of Great Eastern Hotel refusing to budge, the state government has been forced to bend.

 The ruling Left Front is considering restructuring the Early Retirement Scheme (ERS) that had been offered to the 440-odd employees of the state-run hotel 12 days ago.

 ?We have not yet received a single application opting for the ERS. Instead, employees are regularly putting up demonstrations demanding that the notices be withdrawn in toto. I have informed senior officials at Writers? Buildings about the impasse,? Jagannath Bag, the hotel?s member secretary and chief executive, said today.

 Bag, who served the ERS notices on February 25, said the employees have stuck to their stand ?despite our best efforts to make them understand that it is part of the government?s efforts to revive over 20 sick units?.

 Writers? Buildings officials said industry minister Nirupam Sen and tourism minister Dinesh Dakua have lined up a series of meetings with representatives from both Citu, the CPM?s labour arm, and Intuc on March 15 to discuss the ?prevailing imbroglio at the hotel?. 

 ?We have to work out something so that employees can put in their application opting for the scheme,? said an official.

 With tourist flow reduced to a trickle and profits drying up, the government had a few months ago put out advertisements in a daily inviting offers from private entrepreneurs.

 The ERS thus becomes necessary as those interested in taking over the hotel would not be willing to pay salaries to the staff for the two years they are likely to take to carry out renovations.

 Eleven domestic and international groups have been picked out of the 12 who have shown interest. The bidders include ITC, Park Hotels, Inter Continental South West Asia and Bharat Hotels. Claridges Hotel, the Unitech Group, Kenilworth and Sinclairs Hotels are also in the race.

 The Citu leadership had, at a marathon meeting yesterday, indicated that ?certain changes? would be made in the scheme to meet the employees? demands. 

 ?We want the government to at least arrange employment for those who have been working at the hotel only for two or three years.,? said Pravat Samir Roy, secretary of the Great Eastern Hotel Workers? and Employees? Union.

 Tech aid for clean air

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 13: The pollution control board has developed a software-driven system to counter air-pollution from sponge iron units that have mushroomed across south Bengal in the past few years. 

 We have developed an inter-locking system to prevent violation of environment norms, Manab Mukherjee, the minister-in-charge of environment and IT, said. The Environmental Compliance Monitoring and Control System would ensure compliance, he added. 

 Residents in the vicinity of the sponge iron units have been crying foul over the hazardous emissions from the plants, especially after dark. 

 A committee headed by the pollution control boards P.N. Roy had found that a number of units were deactivating the environmental control system ? apparently to save costs ? and belching out untreated fumes. 

 The new system will ensure automatic locking of production if emission-control devices were put off.

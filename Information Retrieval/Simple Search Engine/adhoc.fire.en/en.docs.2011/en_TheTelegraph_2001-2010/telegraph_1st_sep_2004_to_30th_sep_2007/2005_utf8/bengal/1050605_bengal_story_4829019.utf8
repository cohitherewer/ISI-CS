 Focus on rebel camps

 Calcutta/Nadia, June 4: The high commissioner to Bangladesh, Veena Sikri, today met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings and discussed the existence of militant camps in the neighbouring country, says a staff reporter.

 A week ago, we found in newspapers in Bangladesh that a camp along the Assam-Tripura border was raided. This is significant as it shows that camps exist. But the information has come to us only through newspapers.

 In Nadia, jails minister Biswanath Chowdhury said a prison exclusively for Bangladeshis would be set up at Bongaon in North 24-Parganas.

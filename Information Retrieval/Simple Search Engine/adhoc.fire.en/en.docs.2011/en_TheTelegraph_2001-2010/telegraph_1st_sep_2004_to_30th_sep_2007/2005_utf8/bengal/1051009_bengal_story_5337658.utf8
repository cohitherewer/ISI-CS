 Engineer and mum held after wife death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 8: An engineer living in Salt Lake and his mother were arrested after his wife committed suicide this morning. 

 Suchandra Sinha, 38, a resident of BA block, hanged herself from the ceiling fan of the drawing room of her apartment. 

 Her brother, Debasish Basu, lodged a complaint with the police alleging that her husband Abhijit Sinha had been torturing her physically and mentally for quite some time. 

 Basu said that Suchandra committed suicide unable to bear the torture any more.

 The police picked up Abhijit and his mother Subhra Sinha on charges of torturing and inciting the housewife to commit suicide. Aloke Chowdhury, the additional chief judicial magistrate of Salt Lake, sent them to judicial custody till October 21.

 Abhijit is a mechanical engineer working with a private company in the city. He married Suchandra 18 years ago. The couple, who lived on the first floor of a three-storey building at BA 189, had two children, a 17-year-old daughter and a 14-year-old son.

 The daughter was the first to wake up this morning. When she left the bedroom and stepped into the drawing room on the way to the toilet, she found her mother hanging from the ceiling fan. 

 The girl began screaming and Abhijit rushed to the spot. Some of the neighbours came running, too. 

 The husband called a local doctor, who later informed the police about the death.

 The investigating officer said the police had been told that there might have been a tiff between the two of them. We are now trying to find out what were the issues involved and if those were the reasons behind the suicide, he said.

 Abhijit denied the allegation of torture. He said his wife was undergoing mental depression as she was suffering from high blood pressure and numerous gynaecological ailments. 

 Last night, we went to bed as usual. No argument took place. I cannot believe she is no more, Abhijit added.

 The Bidhannagar subdivisional police officer said the police are verifying that.

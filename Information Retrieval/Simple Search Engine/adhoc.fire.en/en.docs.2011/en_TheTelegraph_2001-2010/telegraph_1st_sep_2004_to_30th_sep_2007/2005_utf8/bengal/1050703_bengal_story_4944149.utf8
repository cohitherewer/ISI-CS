 Second teen killer in net

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, July 2: A fortnight after 17-year-old Ajay Agarwal was found murdered in his Surya Sen Street flat, police today arrested Liton Debnath, the second of the two assassins, from south Tripura. 

 Debnath, who was flown into the city late this evening, had tied Ajays hands and legs to help Madan Hatui slit his throat, the police said.

 Hatui had been picked up on June 23 from West Midnapore.

 Soon after the murder, Debnath left the city to take shelter in his sisters home in Kapilong West under Radhakrishnapore police station in Tripura.

 On a tip-off, a team of officers left for Tripura four days ago but Liton eluded the net as he moved from one end of the state to the other. Finally, our team surrounded his sisters place last night and he was arrested this morning, said Gyanwant Singh, the city detective chief.

 On June 18, Anil Agarwal, a businessman, returned home from his Netaji Subhas Road office around 7.45 pm to find his teenage son lying in a pool of blood. 

 A Class XII student of a reputed school on Scot Lane, Ajay had been gagged with a scarf, his hands and legs were tied with a rope and his throat was slit.

 Anil also found Rs 3 lakh in cash, that was kept in a locker next to his sons bedroom, missing. The assassins had broken open the locker and taken away the cash in a handbag that belonged to Ajay. They had also stolen a pair of jeans.

 The police learnt that three of Ajays friends had come over to his place around 11 that morning and left two hours later. 

 All the three were called to the police headquarters in Lalbazar and made to write down everything that happened at the flat. 

 The boys said they had watched television with Ajay, then played computer games and listened to music. Around 1.30 pm, they left. 

 But the clue that proved to be the key was that a tall, hefty man with curly hair was walking up the stairs when they were going home. 

 The sleuths probed deeper and found that two employees of a roadside eatery ? New Savoury ? near the building had gone missing, said an officer.

 Hatui, who matched the the tall, hefty and curly hair description, was picked up on June 23. 

 After days of questioning, the police learnt from Hatui that along with Debnath he had planned the murder to rob Anil. They had kept a close watch on the boys movements and noticed that he would often be alone at home. This made Ajay an easy target, a police official said.

 Teacher defies tradition sermon

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, May 3: Susmita Mondal today attended school wearing a burqa. 

 On her first day at Amtala Annadamani Girls? High School, the English teacher was told by seniors to follow tradition by sticking to the sari.

 Even as Susmita dared the authorities to show what they deemed offensive in her dress, the government sought an explanation from them as to why it had not been informed about the row earlier.

 The office of the Murshidabad inspector of schools asked the institution to explain why it had to know of the controversy through newspapers. Additional district inspector of schools (secondary) Ranjit Ghosh said he was ?surprised?. ?We have sent a letter asking the school authorities to submit a report on what happened actually.?

 Susmita, who converted to Islam at the time of marriage, found support at home. Her husband Kazi Mojibur Rahman, a teacher at Dohradaha High School in Nadia, said: ?She?s done no wrong. She?d take classes in a sari if the others could prove that the burqa was offending.?

 Her colleagues did not speak to her today, said Susmita. ?My in-laws are worried. They are anxious about whether I will be able to continue?. They fear I might face trouble for speaking out.?

 Teacher-in-charge Gouri Ghosh, among those to crack the sari whip, was not available for comment.

 Visva-Bharati steps out of Santiniketan

 - Expansion to take varsity to Calcutta, Delhi amp; London

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Santiniketan, Oct. 23: Visva-Bharati is coming to Calcutta in a new avatar and going farther to Delhi and London. 

 The central university is set to open a modern campus in the city for which it is already looking for land. 

 It also intends to open a liaison office in Delhi, in addition to a centre in London to popularise Tagore studies.

 Varsity officials said the UK government has evinced interest in having a Visva-Bharati centre in London. It had recently sent two representatives to Santiniketan to examine the prospects of a tie-up with the university.

 Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Sujit Basu said: Two professors from universities in the UK were here last month. We held a discussion with them and proposed to set up a study centre in Britain. 

 We are waiting for their final consent, Basu added.

 However, the university will need the Government of Indias permission for setting up the London centre. 

 The expansion drive is aimed at promoting Tagore studies in art and culture, an official said. We are planning short-term certificate and diploma courses in painting, music and other fine arts. 

 In Delhi, an administrative officer will be posted to regularly keep in touch with the Centre ? which governs the institution ? foreign embassies and other national and international offices.

 Basu said a string of proposals from Delhi requesting the authorities to open a unit and run courses from there have got the university going. We are looking into every aspect of the proposals. We will accept them only if they are feasible, he added.

 The Calcutta centre will be Visva-Baharatis second campus ? the first outside Santiniketan. The university is planning to run a management studies course from the city premises.

 So far, the university had been running short courses on music from its Granthan Vibhag (publications department) on AJC Bose Road in Calcutta. 

 Apart from academic activities, we will have an exhibition hall and a guest- house in the new Calcutta centre, the vice-chancellor said. 

 The exhibition hall will be used particularly to exhibit handicrafts and art work by students of the universitys Kalabhavan.

 Krishnagar, May 19: Residents of a village today locked up a headmaster of a primary school and other teachers in the staff room after the cook was caught last night taking home rice meant for students, reports our correspondent.

 Prabhat Mondal, the headmaster of Kakmari primary school in Nadias Hanskhali, about 80 km from Calcutta, and seven other teachers were confined by guardians and members of a local club for more than three hours.

 The agitators said the headmaster had been indifferent to the activities of the cook.

 New leader in TV news race

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 12: Forty-five per cent of the viewership among all news channels on Day I. Thirty-eight per cent over the next four days. Thats how STAR Ananda has performed in Calcutta since its launch on June 1, according to data provided by Television Audience Measurement India. 

 We had a really good launch, says Uday Shankar, CEO of Media Content and Communications Services (MCCS), the STAR group and ABP TV joint venture that manages STAR Ananda. And the numbers reflect that.

 On the day of launch, the channel led the rest by a distance. Compared to its 45 per cent viewership, second placed Tara Newz managed 10 per cent, followed by Aaj Taks 8 per cent, STAR Newss 7 per cent and NDTV Indias 6 per cent. 

 It was not just curiosity that had Calcutta glued to the channel as STAR Anandas performance in the next few days showed. Between June 1 and 4, STAR Anandas 38 per cent market share stood out against NDTV India and Tara Newzs 10 per cent and Aaj Taks 9.

 The timing of the launch ? just as the civic polls were hotting up ? helped garner eyeballs, but what really worked, feels Shankar, was the content. Also a correct assessment of the Calcutta viewers and what they find lacking in the existing channels, he adds.

 The figures are for cable and satellite viewers aged 15 and above ? considered the relevant age group for news channels. But it is not much different for the general category (four years and above) either, Shankar points out.

 It is early days yet and consolidation of the lead is prime on the agenda for the channel. The election coverage is likely to be crucial for that. STAR Ananda plans to seek active participation from Calcuttans by encouraging more interaction and debate.

 There is also the Calcutta Cup, which sees the channel hosting a competition to select the best-maintained ward. A group of neutral and eminent Calcuttans will visit the wards and assess them on various aspects. The winner will be announced right after the polls.

 This would not only encourage new councillors of the winning wards to maintain and improve the conditions, feels the channel, but also set standards for others.

 Eye on profits, terminal to turn private

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 19: The transport department today decided to hand over the Budge Budge truck terminal to a private party for operation and maintenance against an annual fee of about Rs 50 lakh.

 The decision comes a day after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee expressed determination to restructure the transport and power sectors through privatisation to make them viable.

 The chief minister had told the Assembly yesterday that his government is determined to make state transport corporations profit-making. The transport department has already floated tenders to select a consultant to restructure the corporations.

 The government plans to downsize staff and reduce expenditure on the five state transport corporations.

 Budge Budge is the third truck terminal to be handed over to a private agency ? SG Citylink Pvt Ltd ? for operation and maintenance. Earlier, the transport department had entered into a similar agreement with another private party for the upkeep and functioning of the Dhulagarh truck terminal in Howrah. A tender has also been floated for the maintenance of the Kona terminal.

 The Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation, which has built the Budge Budge truck terminal on five acres at a cost of Rs 5 crore, will sign the agreement with Citylink on Monday.

 ?As per the agreement between the TIDC and Citylink, the latter will bear the expenses of running the terminal and will be held responsible for providing all the amenities to the truck operators. The party will pay an annual fee to the TIDC,? Dhiman Mukherjee, the managing director of TIDC, said today.

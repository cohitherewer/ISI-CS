 Security ring for Nadia churches 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 24: Elaborate security arrangements have been made on Christmas eve at all the 150 churches in Nadia in the wake of vandalism at a church in Jalalkhali earlier this month.

 A group of people had burnt communion bread and pages of the Bible before escaping with some church property at Jalalkhali, 70 km from Calcutta, on December 5. The attack was in retaliation to priest Father Antony Kariyattils campaign against alcohol abuse by village youths.

 Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajshekharan said the security rings were thrown around the churches following a request from the church authorities. 

 All churches in the district sought our help to maintain peace on Christmas eve. So, I have ordered that pickets be set up at every church with armed policemen on guard, Rajshekharan said.

 We have also decided to deploy jawans of the Special Combat Force to guard churches close to the border. Patrolling teams have been asked to visit the churches at the time of midnight mass. We are not taking any chances, he added.

 Father Kariyattil said: We requested the police to beef up security in the churches as we want to ensure peace during the midnight mass. We think the villagers attacked the church because they lack education and awareness. Punishing them will not solve the problem. We want to reach out and educate them.

 The priest said prayers would be held for the attackers at the church. Those arrested will have to face trial but we have decided to forgive them. 

 Three persons have been arrested in connection with the attack.

 Freak-shot death

 Rambilas Singh, 51, a CRPF head constable, was killed at Belpahari in West Midnapore, 180 km from Calcutta, when a shot was fired after he accidentally dropped his sten gun.

 Three killed: Three youths in their early 20s were killed when their car collided head-on with a truck on NH41 at Narkelda in East Midnapore, 85 km from Calcutta.

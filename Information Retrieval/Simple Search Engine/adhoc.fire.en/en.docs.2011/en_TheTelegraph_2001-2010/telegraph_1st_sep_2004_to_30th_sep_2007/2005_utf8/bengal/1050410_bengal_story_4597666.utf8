 Govt alters principal policy 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 9: In its bid to improve the standard of teaching at government colleges like the prestigious Presidency, Bethune and Brabourne the government has decided to change its policy on recruitment of principals.

 Abolishing the system of filling up the posts from among teachers holding the rank of professor in such institutions, the government has decided to introduce a system of direct recruitment. 

 The decision follows a long-standing demand from students and teachers, sources in the higher education department said. The quality of teaching suffered in the colleges when a senior professor was taken off academic duties and asked to perform the largely administrative job.

 Presidency College principal Amitava Chatterjee was an economics professor in the institution before taking over as its head. Now, he hardly gets the time and scope to take classes, said a higher education official. Similarly, Bethune College principal Manimala Das, who used teach physics, seldom attends class.

 ?The students are the worst sufferers. Why should a person holding the post of a professor ? the senior-most rank in the teaching service ? be recruited for an administrative job?? asked a Presidency student.

 Besides, when a professor was appointed principal, the post remained vacant till they returned to the earlier position or retired. This created a vacuum, the students alleged. 

 The West Bengal Public Service Commission, which recruits teachers for government colleges, has already sought applications from candidates willing to join as principal in 16 government colleges.

 The advertisement implies that there will be a fresh set of appointments in the institutions where the present heads were selected under the old system. There are 17 government colleges in Bengal.

 The advertisement, however, has created resentment among the principals, who have been asked to apply afresh. Some of them felt it was ?humiliating? to apply for a post which they have been holding.

 The principals also alleged that there was no government intimation on the new policy. 

 ?I have not applied again. If someone else is appointed to my post and I am asked to go back to my department, I will have to abide by the order,? said Amitava Chatterjee. 

 Higher education secretary Jawhar Sircar said: ?Professors who have been appointed principal are very efficient teachers. It is better if they are allowed to focus on teaching.?

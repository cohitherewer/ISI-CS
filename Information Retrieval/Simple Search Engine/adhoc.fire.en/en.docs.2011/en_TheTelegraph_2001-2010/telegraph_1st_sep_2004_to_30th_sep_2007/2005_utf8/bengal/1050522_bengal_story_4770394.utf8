 Blow to cops on lock-up death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 21: A Howrah court today issued non-bailable arrest warrants against four police officers, two of them of inspectors-in-charge rank, in connection with the death of a thief in Bally police lock-up in 2002.

 A Calcutta High Court division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly had last week cancelled the interim bail granted by a Howrah court to the four officers and directed them to surrender before court.

 However, the inspectors-in-charge of Barasat and Jagatballavpur police station, Sunil Biswas and Srimanta Banerjee, Bantra sub-inspector Amal Kanti Das and the then assistant sub-inspector A. Tarafdar did not turn up before the Howrah court.

 The four officers were posted at Bally police station and Biswas was the officer-in-charge when Netai Das died in the lock-up, according to records with the court.

 Das was arrested in connection with a theft in 2001. He was produced in court on February 20, 2002. The very next day, he was found hanging from the ceiling, said the deceaseds family lawyer, Subhasish Roy.

 The incident took a serious turn when the post mortem report revealed that several injury marks were found on the body of the accused, said the lawyer.

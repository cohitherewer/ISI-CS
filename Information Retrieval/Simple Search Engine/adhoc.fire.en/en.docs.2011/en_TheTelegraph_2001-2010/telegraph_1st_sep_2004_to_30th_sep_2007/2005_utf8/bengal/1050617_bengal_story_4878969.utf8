Calcutta, June 16: A days attendance in the Assembly will not entitle a legislator fees for the entire session, according to a decision taken at an all-party meeting today.

 The new norm, under which legislators are expected to sign the attendance register daily, will be implemented when the budget session of the House resumes on June 27, Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim said at a press conference.

 The MLAs will not be entitled to get their allowance of Rs 350 a day if they are found absent on three consecutive days, the Speaker said. One days signature will help members get the allowance for three consecutive days. However, members will not get their allowance if they do not sign the register after that.

 Ministers would also have to sign the register daily, the Speaker said, but did not specify the consequences if they do not. 

 I have asked the ministers to attend the House regularly and they have given me their word, he said.

 The decision to implement the rule requiring attendance registers to be signed everyday was taken at the meeting of House whips held recently in New Delhi and is aimed at not only improving attendance but also encouraging participation in discussions.

 There are certain MLAs who do not attend the House on the pretext of important engagements in the constituency. Some ministers also give the same excuse and even remain absent when questions regarding their departments are to be asked, alleged Congress MLA Abdul Mannan.

 The speaker also said there will be no special force in the House from this session but, if necessary, they will be called to tackle an untoward situation. I hope MLAs behave decently and there is no necessity to call the special security force, he said.

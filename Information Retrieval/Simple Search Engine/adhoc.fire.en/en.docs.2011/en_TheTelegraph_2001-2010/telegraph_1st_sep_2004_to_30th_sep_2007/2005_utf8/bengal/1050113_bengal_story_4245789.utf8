 Calcutta, Jan. 12: Business, politics, pilgrimage and a bit of soccer ? all packed into Manmohan Singh?s second day in Calcutta. 

 The Prime Minister kick-started the hectic day by inaugurating the Partnership Summit 2005 ? a prestigious CII-organised gathering of the captains of industry ? at the National Library lawns. 

 Next stop was Swami Vivekananda?s ancestral house on Simla Road in North Calcutta. 

 Circled by heavy security, Singh, in his hallmark white kurta-pyjama and a greyish-blue jacket, arrived around 2.20 pm in a black Skoda accompanied by wife Gursharan Kaur and governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi. He was received by Swami Smaranananda, general secretary of the Ramkrishna Mission, and Swami Vishokananda. 

 Singh paused a moment before passing through the carved wooden door into the ancestral house of Swamiji which was inaugurated last October by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam. 

 On the first floor, Singh visited the spot where ?the divine child was born at the crack of dawn on Makar Sankranti? according to the engraving on a copper plate. He stood for a few minutes in front of a photograph of Vivekananda before offering flowers along with Kaur and paying tributes with folded hands. 

 Earlier in the day, Kaur had caught up with Singh?s sister at Behala. She spent some time with the family and was treated to sandesh. 

 Singh also visited the text book library on the campus before receiving a ?concept paper? on the Ramkrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational and Research Institute, currently a deemed university. ?We wanted to have a brief conversation over tea but he was hard-pressed for time,? Swami Smaranananda said as Singh left after waving at the crowd. 

 At Yuva Bharti Krirangan, Singh kicked a football to inaugurate the ninth edition of the National Football League. He also presented the Fifa Centenary Award to P.K. Banerjee, after receiving a cheque of Rs 15 lakh from Priya Ranjan Das Munshi towards the Prime Minister?s Relief Fund. 

 Earlier, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had presented a cheque of Rs 3.5 crore towards his relief fund.

 PM?s sister leads aid effort

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Jan. 1: She?s quiet and diffident 

and makes it a point of staying away from the limelight. However, tomorrow Pritam 

Kaur will walk round the Behala neighbourhood asking people to lend a helping 

hand to the tsunami victims. The proceeds will go to the Prime Minister?s relief 

fund.

 Kaur is not doing it because Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is her brother. She is doing it because her heart bleeds for the victims of the tsunami. ?Jo dekh rahey hain TV pe who dekha nahi jata? It is difficult to see the aftermath of the disaster on television. Just imagine what must be going on where the killer waves struck,? she wondered.

 Her husband, Vidyarattan Singh, will be there with her when the group starts off from Battala Bazaar in Behala to connect with people of the neighbourhood.

 The Central Behala Block Congress Committee had planned the programme and, when they approached Pritam Kaur and her husband, the couple ? residents of Behala?s Parnasree for the past 13 years ? agreed to join them in their effort.

 Pritam Kaur?s husband does most of the talking, as she quietly listens and nods in agreement, encircled by her grandchildren.

 ?We are very ordinary people. It is not important that we are related to the Prime Minister?. We will only approach our neighbours who have known us for years as who we are?,? explained Singh, who loves his bhaat and machher jhol much like a Bengali.

 Kaur has not even been able to share her feelings about her endeavour of tomorrow with her brother. ?He is busy?perhaps he will come to know. But it is not important whether he knows it or not,? she said.

 Their son, Jasdeep Singh, who deals in automobile spare parts, will also be part of an effort to raise donations from shops in and around Mangoe Lane, where his own shop is located.

 Work watch for land levy babus

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, March 13: Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah today unveiled plans to monitor his officers, some of whom have been up in arms since he set out to clean up his department.

 A plan is being drawn up to evaluate the officers? performance regularly so that they can be penalised if found neglecting duty. 

 Sukumar Das, the secretary of the department, will issue an order asking all 341 block land and land reform officers to submit performance reports of their blocks to the government by April-end. About 3,500 revenue collectors report to the block officers.

 Last month, when union leaders went to Mollah with demands for a salary hike, among others, he kept them waiting. The minister told them later it was a lesson to show how people feel when the officers make them sit out for hours. Adding insult to injury, he called them ?thieves?.

 The officers hit back issuing a veiled threat to their boss, saying work was bound to be affected because of the minister?s ?rude? behaviour. 

 The move to monitor performance is being seen as Mollah?s way of finding out how the officers are doing. 

 On Friday, Das informed the block officers about the performance scale and added that if found wanting, they would either be transferred or deprived of their pay. 

 About a thousand officers of the department will wear black badges from tomorrow, protesting against Mollah?s comments about their representatives. ?We have also written to the minister asking him to withdraw his remarks about us. Moreover, we also want the discussions on our demands to be resumed,? said Pronob Dey, the secretary of the West Bengal Land and Land Reforms Officers? Association. 

 Between March 21 and 24, there will be demonstrations in the districts, Dey added. 

 The minister declined comment. ?I?ll speak only after the first 10 days of the Bengali new year,? he said. 

 His department goes by the Bengali calendar in its financial year and the performance reports from the blocks are expected after this year closes on April 14.

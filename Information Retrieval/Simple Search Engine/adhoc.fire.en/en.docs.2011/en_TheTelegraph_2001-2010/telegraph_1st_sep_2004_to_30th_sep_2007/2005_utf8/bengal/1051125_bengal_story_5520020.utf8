 Court cordon for Adhirs show

 - Police deny permission for protests 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Nov. 24: Police would not allow Congress supporters within a kilometre of the chief judicial magistrates court here on Monday when Adhir Chowdhury is to be produced.

 The state Congress leadership has asked all party MLAs and district unit presidents to be present for a law violation in front of the Murshidabad collectorate, barely 100 metres away, that day.

 The district police sounded firm. There is no question of granting any kind of permission. We will not allow any Congress supporter to come within a kilometre of the court compound, superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh said.

 On November 20, when the local MP was first produced in court a day after his arrest from Delhi in connection with a double murder on July 23, Congress workers fought a pitched battle with the police, who resorted to baton charge and burst tear-gas shells in the face of heavy brickbatting. Three policemen and nine Congress supporters were injured.

 Singh said: That day, we saw that the Congress leaders have no control on their supporters. An MP (Mannan Hossain) and the zilla parishad sabhadhipati (Siddika Begum), who were present outside the court compound, could not control party work- ers who were carrying brickbats in their bags. We have informed the district magistrate why we will not give the permission for Monday.

 The Congress brass expect 100,000 people to turn up. Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and former mayor Subrata Mukherjee are expected to be there, too.

 In Calcutta, Mukherjee today led a procession of Youth Congress activists and courted arrest at the BB Ganguly Street and Phears Lane crossing. We will assemble in front of the collectorate in Behrampore and see what happens, he said.

 State party chief and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee will arrive here on Saturday and hold a meeting with all prominent district Congress leaders.

 The local leaders, who did not expect the police to put their foot down, sounded cautious but belligerent. We will discuss it with Pranabda. The administration cannot throttle our right to protest, Hossain said from Delhi.

 Adhirda has instructed us from jail to bring supporters from all across the district, said Heera Begum, a womens wing leader.

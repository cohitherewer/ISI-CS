 PM tryst with party

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 7: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will address Congress supporters at Rabindra Sarobar stadium a day after the CPM finalises a resolution primarily clarifying its relations with the former rival. 

 The state Congress today received a missive from its high command in Delhi about Singh?s programme. 

 Pradip Bhattacharya, the working president of the party?s Bengal unit, said: ?Manmohan Singhji?s first meeting with state Congress workers in his capacity as Prime Minister will boost their morale and enable them to put up a more effective fight against the CPM.? 

 Then Prime Minister Narasimha Rao had addressed state Congress workers in 1998. Bhattacharya said the supporters are very enthused about Tuesday?s meeting, which will also be attended by defence minister and state party chief Pranab Mukherjee and Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. 

 A proposed meeting between Mamata Banerjee and the Prime Minister has sent the political mill spinning. 

 ?It is a one-to-one,? said a Congress leader. ?Let?s see what emerges.? He added that a section of the Trinamul Congress is keen to return to the parent party.

 Land-use boost to Molla

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 20: Calcutta High Courts order yesterday to stop the construction of two housing projects at South 24-Parganas has emboldened land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla to fight his own government on the illegal use of agricultural land for real estate.

 Molla has for the past one year been raising his voice against the government for allowing private entrepreneurs to convert agricultural land into real estate.

 In April, his department declared war against realtors who obtain sanctions from the CPM-run Bhangore gram panchayat in South 24-Parganas for converting agricultural land into commercial use.

 The Green Valley and Sanjibani housing projects for higher-income group people were coming up under the Kochpur mouza of Bhangore. The panchayat had allowed the owners of the two companies to convert the wetland.

 Residents of the area raised objections and the matter was referred to the land and land revenue department.

 Molla then asked the district land reforms officer to lodge a police complaint against the promoters for violating norms about the transfer of agricultural land.

 The promoters then moved Calcutta High Court, challenging the police action.

 Samaraditya Pal and Shaktinath Mukherjee, appearing on behalf of the promoters, argued that their clients had done nothing wrong by starting construction after the panchayat had given its sanction.

 My clients cannot be found guilty as they have got sanction from the panchayat to go ahead with the construction, they said.

 Justice Pranab Kumar Chattopadhaya, who was hearing the matter first, turned down an appeal by the land department seeking a stay on the construction.

 Later, the case came up for hearing in May before Justice Maharaja Sinha, who also extended the interim order from time to time.

 The department then moved an appeal against the order before a division bench of the same court, which after hearing both the sides passed an interim order yesterday staying the order of the single judge.

 Legal experts said the courts order assumes significance as it will debar realtors from grabbing agricultural and wetlands.

 Minister Kironmoy Nanda also took exception to the government decision of allegedly converting wetlands and agricultural land for commercial purposes.

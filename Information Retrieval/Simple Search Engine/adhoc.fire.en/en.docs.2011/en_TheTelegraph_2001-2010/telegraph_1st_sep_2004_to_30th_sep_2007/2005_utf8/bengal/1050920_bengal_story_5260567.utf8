 Calcutta, Sept. 19: The gov- ernment has constituted a committee to look into allegations of harassment and atrocities on members of the backward classes at workplaces.

 The committee, with the chief minister as its chairman, will meet every six months to review cases of harassment and atrocities on members of backward communities and direct police to take prompt action, backward classes welfare minister Upen Kisku said.

 Kisku, a member of the 25-member committee also comprising finance minister Asim Dasgupta, the chief secretary, the home secretary and the director-general of police, said it has been set up in accordance with a central directive. We have less cases of atrocities on members of backward communities compared with Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh or Maharashtra, but we are serious about addressing the emerging problem, he said. 

 The minister referred to two recent cases in which two backward class women were humiliated and harassed. 

 Balika Majhi, a social science teacher of Purulia Kanda High School, had to stop taking classes three months ago after being harassed by a teacher belonging to an upper caste. 

 We have sought reports from the school management and asked Majhi to lodge a complaint with the police. We shall refer her complaint to the committee for further action, the minister said.

 At Khejuri in East Midnapore, a backward-class woman had to leave her job at the Integrated Child Development Scheme two months ago, unable to bear taunts at office.

 The way she was asked not to attend office for being a backward woman is shocking. We have directed her to lodge a police complaint against those who harassed her, Kisku said.

 The new committee would have offices in all districts, said the commissioner of backward class welfare.

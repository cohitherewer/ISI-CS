 Family killer spared 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Feb. 9: Calcutta High Court today commuted a death sentence to life imprisonment in the second such instance since the hanging of Dhananjoy Chatterjee.

 A division bench of Justices Alok Kumar Basu and Pranab Kumar Deb passed the order, sparing Arup Singha Roy the noose in the murder of his wife and nine-month-old son.

 The resident of Daspara in Murshidabad had been sentenced to death by the additional sessions judge in Behrampore in July 2003 for murdering Urmila and Kanak by slitting their throats with a knife in August 1998. 

 Singha Roy had moved the high court. After hearing additional public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami, the bench held that the crime could not be considered ?rarest of rare?. ?We, therefore, are commuting the death sentence of the petitioner to life,? the judges said.

 Ten days ago, the high court had commuted to life imprisonment the death sentence of Bishu Mondal, also from Murshidabad, who was convicted of raping and murdering a teenager. 

 Dhananjoy?s death sentence in the Hetal Parekh rape and murder case had been upheld by the high court. 

 Earlier, Goswami strongly opposed Singha Roy?s petition and told the court that the petitioner had committed an unpardonable crime.

 ?At the time of the incident, no one was present in the house. So the question of a witness does not arise. But think about the baby. Only someone evil can cut his own son?s throat,? Goswami told the court.

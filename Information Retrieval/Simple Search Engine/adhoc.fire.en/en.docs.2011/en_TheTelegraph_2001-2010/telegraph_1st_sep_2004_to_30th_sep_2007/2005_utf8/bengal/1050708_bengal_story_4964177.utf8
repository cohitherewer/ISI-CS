 Govt pledge on civic bodies

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 7: The government 

 today pledged to bring an end to the clout wielded by contractors 

 in civic bodies across the state.

 Municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya told the Assembly that the government would take steps to ensure that the 126 municipalities run transparently and focus on providing better civic amenities, particularly to the poorer sections.

 We have set up community development societies and ward committees to bring an end to the contractor raj in civic bodies. We also want transparency in the way civic bodies function, the minister said while replying to the debate on the municipal affairs and urban development budget.

 Bhattacharya virtually echoed late CPM leader Benoy Chowdhury, who had also protested against the contractor raj more than one-and-half decades ago as the then state land and land reforms minister.

 Bhattacharya, who also looks after urban development, said 80 ward committee offices and several development societies had been set up so that people could play an active part in community affairs.

 We will provide the necessary infrastructure for urbanisation and not allow a section of land speculators to make profit out of this.

 However, the minister said the government would encourage housing joint ventures with the private sector. We want comprehensive urbanisation and for that, we have to take help from private parties, he added.

 Bhattacharya said many civic bodies were flouting norms of recruitment and not maintaining audit reports properly, leading people to believe that the municipalities were involved in financial irregularities. The government will provide each municipality a finance officer, a planner and an assistant engineer, he said.

 CPM leader murderer 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 30: Police today arrested Abdus Sattar Molla, a district committee member of the CPMs South 24-Parganas unit known to be close to land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla, after a court convicted him for murdering a Congress activist a decade ago.

 Alipore additional district and sessions judge Manojit Mandal will deliver the verdict tomorrow.

 Yusuf Molla was killed on April 29, 1995, at Netagolampur in Bhangar. Five CPM activists, including Molla, were named in the FIR lodged by his relatives. Three of them are still at large. 

 Molla, who probably did not apprehend that he would be convicted, attended the hearing today like previous occasions. After Mandal pronounced him guilty of the murder and the police surrounded him, a stunned Molla did not utter a word.

 It is learnt that Molla had played a major role in assisting the minister to identify land for the Indonesia-based Salim Group in the district. He had also reportedly convinced Abdur Rezzak Molla that the CPM would suffer a setback in the Assembly elections if the government handed over farmland at Bhangar ? a part of the ministers constituency ? to the group.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told the media yesterday that no land at Bhangar would be acquired for the Salim Group as the area supplied vegetables and fish to Calcutta. 

 CPM district secretary Santimoy Bhattacharjee said: Im not saying anything on the courts decision.

 After the murder of CPM activist Suren Khan in April 1995, a mob led by Molla allegedly picked up Yusuf and beat him up. The next morning, he was found dead.

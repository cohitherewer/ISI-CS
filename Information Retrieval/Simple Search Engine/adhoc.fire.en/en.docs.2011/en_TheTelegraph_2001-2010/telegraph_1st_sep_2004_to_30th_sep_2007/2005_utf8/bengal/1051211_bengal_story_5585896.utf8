 Baby snatch at home

 - Woman caught picking child off Park St

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 10: A woman in her thirties was caught today minutes after she had sneaked out of a Park Street building with a two-year-old daughter of a businessman. 

 The childs aunt noticed the woman when she was about to walk away with the baby in her lap and raised an alarm.

 As the news spread, local people rushed to the spot and beat up the woman, later identified as Kanika Kisku. A section of residents called Park Street police station, whose officers rescued the woman and arrested her on kidnapping charges.

 We are questioning Kanika Kisku, a resident of Na- yagram in East Midnapore, about her role in other similar incidents in the city, said N.R. Babu, the deputy commissioner, south division.

 According to police, the incident took place around 11.15 am. Kanika entered the groundfloor of a three- storey building on Wellesly Second Lane off Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Street, walked straight down its corridor and took a left turn where Bushra Nawaz was playing alone, a police officer said.

 Trouble for Kanika started as she took the child in her lap. Bushra started crying because she did not like to go to an unknown person. On hearing her scream, my wife Sagufta and sister-in-law Zaheera Firdaus rushed out of the kitchen. On seeing her in Kanikas lap, they raised an alarm, said Anwar Hussain, the childs uncle, who has a leather business and a courier agency in the area.

 Sensing trouble, Kanika ran towards the exit leaving behind the child on the corridor. But she was caught. 

 Anwar said: All five brothers live in the building with our families. Our children play on the ground-floor corridor. The lane in front is always crowded. We are stunned that someone could make such an audacious attempt. 

 Pappu, a local youth, said Kanika had entered their apartment a few minutes before sneaking into Hussains. As I was going in, I saw her coming out of the main gate. I did not find anything wrong. Now it appears that she went there to lift a child, he said.

 At least nine missing diaries have been lodged with the city police in the past week. All of them except a two-and-a-half-year-old child who went missing on Wednesday have been traced. 

 Police suspect that a woman who came to the boys house in Narkeldanga to sell herbs abducted him. 

 About 1,000 missing diaries are lodged with the city police every year. This year, 30 of them are still to be found.

 Rezzak woe on land policy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 23: The minister for land and land reforms, Abdul Rezzak Mollah, has created a controversy by expressing displeasure over some policy decisions of the government, particularly those concerning the conversion of agricultural land.

 Mollah, who had triggered a furore in administrative circles by publicly complaining about corrupt officials in his department, has also shot off a letter to state CPM secretary Anil Biswas.

 The minister admitted having written to Biswas before leaving for Dehradun on July 19 to attend the central committee meeting of the All India Kisan Sabha, the CPMs peasants wing. But I have never offered to quit as minister, he clarified.

 Mollah refused to divulge the contents of the letter. Why should I tell you? he asked. However, this much I can tell you that I want to discuss some important issues with our party secretary. This is very simple but some newspapers are cooking up stories, he said.

 Biswas told media at the CPM headquarters that the minister had sent a letter before he left for Dehradun, according to party norms. But what you have written in newspapers is all rubbish.

 Jyoti Basu also denied having discussed anything concerning Mollah at yesterdays secretariat meeting. I am not aware of Mollahs grievances. Let him come back first, said the veteran CPM leader.

 Party insiders said Mollah has resented the manner in which nearly 500 acres of agricultural and residential land at Rajarhat on the citys northern fringes have been converted for the infotech sector.

 The minister, they said, tried to raise his voice against the conversion when it came up for discussion at the last cabinet meeting but could do little as the others at the meeting agreed to it.

 Mollah, who hails from a farmers family, also protested against the reckless conversion of farmers lands to benefit some industrialists. The minister made it clear that he is not against industrialisation but said industries must not come up at the cost of poor farmers.

 The minister also expressed concern publicly over the rampant filling up of wetlands in the city and its adjoining areas to help some realtors build high-rises.

 Mollah had even publicly complained about realtors move to fill up wetlands overnight to construct high-rises.

 and favoured stringent laws to curb the activities of unscrupulous promoters.

 Party sources said Mollah also wanted the leadership to give him a free hand to firmly deal with recalcitrant and corrupt officials in his department. He made it clear time and again that those who shirked responsibilities or were found guilty of corrupt practices had to be weeded out.

 Job jitters for bidi workers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Aurangabad, April 27: Citu?s demand for more wages for local bidi workers has prompted manufacturers to think of shifting their units out of the state, a move that could leave lakhs jobless.

 Shyam Bidi Works Limited?s unit at Aurangabad in Murshidabad district, 280 km from Calcutta, was closed after Citu leaders insisted on a wage hike, costing 3,000 workers their jobs.

 District magistrate N. Manjunatha Prasad has convened a meeting of bidi manufacturers and workers? representatives with the local leadership of Citu, the CPM?s labour arm, on April 30 to resolve the impasse. ?I have not received any official complaint from any side, but heard about the problem. Let us see what transpires at the April 30 meeting,? he said.

 There are 784 bidi-manufacturing companies in Murshidabad district employing about six lakh workers. The daily wage of a worker for manufacturing 1,000 bidis went up from Rs 28.20 in 1999 to Rs 37.20 this year. There is a proposal to increase the wage by Rs 7.20. However, Citu wants it to be raised to Rs 50.

 Ram Avatar Singh of Shyam Bidi Works Limited said: ?The daily wage in Bengal is Rs 37.20. But over and above it, Citu leaders here are extracting mastan kar (forced subscription) from us almost regularly?. We will close our units in Jangipur and Dhulian as soon as the wage is hiked. At the same time, we will be expanding our business at Pakur in Jharkhand. All this will throw many workers out of employment, but we are helpless. After all, we are running the business to make some profit.?

 Another bidi manufacturer condemned the Citu?s ?militancy?. He said its leaders ?last year destroyed 30 lakh bidis manufactured by my company in the name of carrying out a trade union movement?.

 District Citu secretary Tushar De said the bidi manufacturers? threat to shift to either Bihar or Jharkhand would ?not make us give up our demand for a wage hike?. We are also not collecting any forcible subscription from the bidi manufacturers. This is a canard spread by the owners?.

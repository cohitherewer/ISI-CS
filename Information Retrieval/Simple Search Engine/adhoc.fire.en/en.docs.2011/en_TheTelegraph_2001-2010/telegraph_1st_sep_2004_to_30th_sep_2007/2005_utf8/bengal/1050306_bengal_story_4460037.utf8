 Racket busted: Fake notes too close to real

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 5: The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) today arrested a former employee of a state-run blood bank from his Lake View Road apartment and recovered counterfeit notes worth Rs 22.5 lakh.

 Police raided Shankar Acharya?s house a little after midnight, after receiving a tip-off from the Subsidiary Intelligence Bureau (SIB), the central intelligence gathering agency.

 The bureau, during the course of investigations into counterfeit currency entering the country through ISI channels, found out about Acharya. 

 Fake notes in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000, ? suspected to be printed in Karachi ? have been making their way to India from Bangladesh.

 The bureau informed the CID when Acharya had crossed over from Petrapole-Benapole border to North 24-Parganas district with a huge amount of counterfeit notes stashed in a suitcase. ?The agency provided us his residential address. Accordingly, a joint team comprising officers from the CID and Tollygunge police station raided Acharya?s house around 1 am,? said a CID official.

 However, initially the sleuths found nothing. ?When we opened the suitcase, it was empty. We thought Acharya had already passed on the notes to someone else,? said Rajeev Kumar, CID?s deputy inspector-general of police (operations).

 ?Fortune favoured us when one of the officers examining the suitcase found it to be abnormally heavy even though it was empty. Then we removed its false cover and recovered the notes.?

 The 40-year-old Acharya pleaded innocence during interrogation. He told CID officials that he went to Khulna district with a valid passport and visa a few days ago and returned home last night. ?We are now looking for two persons ? the one who supplied him the fake notes and the person to whom he was supposed to pass on the consignment. The latter has been identified as a Bangladeshi national,? an official said.

 An examination of the fake notes by experts of the Reserve Bank of India revealed that the technology used to print them was very similar to the one used by the Indian government. ?Almost all the security features of a genuine note have been incorporated perfectly. However, there are still three or four fine differences that exist, but this cannot be identified by a layman,? said Kumar.

 ?Even when we placed a fake and a genuine note for an ultra violet ray test, there was no difference,? said another official.

 Police said this is the first time they have come across counterfeit notes that bear such close resemblance to the real ones. ?This is a real professional job and could not have been carried out by any odd counterfeiter. We are certain that the government of a neighbouring country must have been involved,? an official said.

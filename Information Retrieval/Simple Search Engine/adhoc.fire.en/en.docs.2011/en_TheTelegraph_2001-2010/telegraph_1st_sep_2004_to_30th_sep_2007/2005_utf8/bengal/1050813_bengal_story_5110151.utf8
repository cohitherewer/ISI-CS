 Museum amp; mall in station

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: A shopping centre, cineplex and food court will come up close to the Howrah station if the Railway Board green-signals an Eastern Railway proposal.

 The new facilities, about 200 metres south of the heritage station, on Foreshore Road, would be set up on railway land by a private developer.

 A number of private parties have shown interest in the project and we have sent the proposal to the Railway Board keeping in view its directive regarding more commercial usage of railway land, Pradip Kumar, the Eastern Railway deputy general manager and heritage officer, said today.

 The commercial complex is likely to come up next to the first regional railway museum, which will showcase railway heritage on the lines of National Railway Museum in Delhi. Eastern Railway general manager Shyam Kumar laid the foundation stone for the museum today.

 It will be difficult for the railways alone to set up the museum and run it. So we are looking for private parties to do the job, said Pradip Kumar. For commercial viability of the project, they will build the cineplex and shopping mall adjacent to the museum, he added.

 The 4-acre plot for the museum was earlier part of the Howrah goods shed. Lying unused for years, the land is now covered with shrubs. 

 The authorities are also planning a tie-up with the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority and the state government for a packaged tour to the museum and mall by those who visit Millennium Park on the other bank of the Hooghly. We are holding talks with both on whether a ferry or water taxi service can be started between Millennium Park and the museum, an official said. This way we can attract visitors and ensure viability of the mall.

 The area adjacent to the station would get a facelift because of the project, said an official, who added that the museum should be ready by mid-2007. The heritage house will showcase old coaches, steam engines, wagons, telephones, lamps, signals, clocks, manuscripts, maps and other articles used across eras by various railway systems and highlight the evolution of railways in Eastern India in 151 years.

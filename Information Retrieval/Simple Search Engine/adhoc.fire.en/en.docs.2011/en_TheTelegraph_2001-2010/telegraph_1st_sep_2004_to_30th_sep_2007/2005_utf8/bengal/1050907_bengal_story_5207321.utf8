 Familys AIDS blot stains girl

 NARESH JANA

 Midnapore, Sept. 6: Shunned by her school, friends and neighbours, six-year-old Putul Pradhan today only has her grandmother for company. And the stigma of HIV-positive parents.

 AIDS took away her father Bishweswar and one-and-a-half-year-old brother Biraj in Angua village in West Midnapores Dantan, 180 km from Calcutta. 

 Her mother Namita, also suffering from the disease, was virtually hounded out of the village and is now counting her days at her parents home in Padima village near Rajghat in Orissa.

 Putul tested HIV-negative at the target(now a medical college), but that could not wash the stain off her.

 I sold off my 10 cottahs of land for my sons treatment. Today, I beg and borrow to feed Putul. What will happen to her when I die? asked Putuls 55-year-old widowed grandmother, Bhabani.

 Tears streaming down her cheeks, Bhabani said villagers do not send their children to the local Shishu Shiksha Kendra if Putul attends class. Whenever Putul goes out to play with children her age, they run away. Nobody seems to understand that Putul does not suffer from AIDS and that she is a perfectly healthy child.

 District health authorities pleaded helplessness. We had sent medical teams to Angua village to create awareness on AIDS. The team members visited Angua and held seminars and spoke to the villagers. We told villagers that Putul is free from all kinds of diseases. She has not been afflicted with AIDS. We also told them that AIDS does not spread so easily. But the superstitious villagers just wouldnt listen. What can we do? asked the district chief medical officer of health, Mangobinda Mondal.

 The villagers rubbished the health authorities efforts. Doctors tell such things, but we are not convinced, said Purna Chandra Giri, an elderly villager.

 A middle-aged Vivekananda Sen, too, was adamant. Maybe AIDS does not spread as easily as we think. But we cant take any risk for the sake of our children, he said.

 Asked what the local panchayat had done to bring Putul justice, Parulbala Das, a member, said: We cant impose anything. It is true Putul is not welcome to the school. It is also true that if Putul is allowed to attend classes, villagers will withdraw their children from the school. We are trying to help Putul.

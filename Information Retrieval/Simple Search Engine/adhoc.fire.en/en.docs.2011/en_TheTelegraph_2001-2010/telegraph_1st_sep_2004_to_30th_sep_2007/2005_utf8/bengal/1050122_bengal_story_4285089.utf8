 Hospital thieves hit patients

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Jan. 21: The medical college and hospital here seems to have become a burglars? favourite.

 Over 30 thefts have been reported since last July. The targets, though, were not doctors? devices or hospital equipment, but patients? money, clothes, food and medicines. 

 Stethoscopes and blood pressure-measuring machines, which often lay on tables with few people around, remained untouched.

 Last Monday, thieves took away a patient?s clothes hanging from window grilles. Another patient, Sabina Biwi, said she was asleep one night when a noise woke her up. ?Three men were cutting a window grille with hacksaws. I raised an alarm... they fled,? she said. 

 A health official said: ?Repeated complaints to Burdwan police station have not yielded much result. The 400-bed hospital has about 35 guards from a private agency, besides a police camp of 15 personnel for round-the-clock vigil.?

 Deputy superintendent of the hospital Manju Murshed said: ?We lodged written complaints with the local police but no action was taken.?

 Superintendent Neeraj Singh denied having taken the thefts lightly. ?We investigated each and every complaint. I will visit the hospital and draw up additional measures to prevent thefts in future,? he said.

 Woman led rebel hit

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Calcutta, Oct. 7: A woman in her early thirties had led Tuesdays operation of blowing up a police camp under construction at Bandwan in Purulia.

 Police have identified her as Jagari Baskey, a key member of the CPI(Maoist)s action squad. She was also one of the squad members who raided (CPM zonal committee member) Mahendra Mahatos residence and killed him on July 9. (On Tuesday) she was accompanied by another youth, identified as Marsar, said an officer of Purulia police.

 On Tuesday evening, a group of Maoists entered Purulia, 280 km from Calcutta, through Bogdoba, a remote hamlet bordering Jharkhand and Purulia.

 They forced residents of the nearby Gurupana village to guide them to the camp. After blowing it up, they fled towards Ghatshila in Jharkhand through the same route.

 An Intelligence Branch (IB) official said: She (Jagari) is from Bogdoba village and knows the jungle routes like the back of her hand. She joined the organisation only a year ago and has already become one of the key members.

 Besides, she is one of the most daring members of the outfit. This is why the top leaders like to engage her in every operation they plan in Purulia, especially in and around Bandwan, he added.

 Police and intelligence officials working on Maoist activities have come to know that the plot to blow up the camp was the brainchild of Dwijen Hembram, better known as Anantada in Naxalite circles. 

 He is in charge of the organisations Midnapore-Bankura-Purulia unit. The plan to destroy the camp was chalked out a month ago, said an IB official.

 Maestro son arrested

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 4: Kirit Khan, a sitar player and son of the late sarod maestro Ustad Bahadur Khan, was arrested this afternoon on charges of duping a tabla player of Rs 45,000. 

 After Proloy Ghoshal lodged the complaint, Khan was called to the Lalbazar police headquarters from his Palm Avenue residence and taken into custody.

 We arrested him on the basis of a specific complaint. Ghoshal, from Khardah, alleged that Khan had promised to give him a chance to perform abroad and charged him Rs 45,000. We decided to arrest him after finding inconsistencies in his statement during questioning, said Gyanwant Singh, a detective department deputy commissioner.

 In the complaint, Ghoshal said Khan had promised last year that he would arrange shows for him in Frankfurt and London. An agreement was signed between them and Khan charged the money as the cost of work permit and passage, said Singh.

 A detective department official said Khan had not made any arrangement for the trip. Ghoshal began prodding him after the time promised by Khan went by, said an official, adding: Whenever Ghoshal asked Khan the reason for the delay, he gave lame excuses. Sensing something was wrong, Ghoshal asked for a refund. But Khan refused to pay him back. 

 Ghoshal alleged that when he told Khan he would go to police, he said he knew a number of influential people and that a police complaint would not be of any help. Ghoshal came to Lalbazar today, met Singh and gave a blow-by-blow account of his deal with Khan.

 A team of detectives was asked to look into the allegations. Some of the sleuths went to Khans house and met him. We did not arrest him there. Rather, we told him to come over to our headquarters, said one of them.

 At the detective department, Khan was questioned. We told him about the allegations and asked him to clarify his point. But he failed to give us any satisfactory answer, Singh said.

 An officer working on the case said the sitar player has been accused of duping other artistes as well. An inquiry has been ordered.

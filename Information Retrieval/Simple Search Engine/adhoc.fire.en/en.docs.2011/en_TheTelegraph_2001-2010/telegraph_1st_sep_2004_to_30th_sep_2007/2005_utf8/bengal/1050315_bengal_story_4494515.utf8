 Island pitch for tourists

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 The Andamans: Picture perfect

Calcutta, March 14: The Andamans, ravaged by the Boxing Day tsunami, are ready to welcome tourists again, the top executive of the idyllic islands said today.

 On a day?s visit to the city, Lt Governor Ram Kapse said: ?In spite of the disastrous earthquake and tsunami, most of the tourist spots are safe and the administration has taken steps to revive tourism on the islands.?

 Tourism was also the focus of talks he had with governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi at Raj Bhavan. Kapse said he would discuss with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee the tourism potential of the islands when he comes back in April to attend the meeting of a task force constituted by the Bengal government.

 Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury heads the panel formed to look into problems faced by tourists who travel by ship to the islands. ?I have been told that passengers often undergo an ordeal to reach the islands as ships are irregular. I am serious about resolving the problem,? Kapse said.

 Over 100,000 tourists visit the Andamans every year. Almost 60 per cent of them travel from Calcutta, Kapse added.

 Kapse said he has requested civil aviation minister Praful Patel to reduce the fares on Indian Airlines flights between Port Blair and Calcutta. ?I hope that an announcement on the revised fare structure will be made shortly.?

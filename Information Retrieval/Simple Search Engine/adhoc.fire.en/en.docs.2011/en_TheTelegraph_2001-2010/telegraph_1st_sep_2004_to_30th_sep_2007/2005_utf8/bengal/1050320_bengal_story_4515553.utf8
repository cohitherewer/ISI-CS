 BSNL cracks whip

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 19: BSNL has threatened to terminate the service of executives gearing up to intensify an agitation that has disrupted landline-to-mobile links and Internet connections.

 The BSNL management has asked the executives, who are on a work-to-rule protest over promotion policies, to submit a written undertaking that they will not be part of the agitation.

 If the executives fail to give the undertaking, their service would be terminated with a month?s salary.

 The newly-recruited junior technical officers and junior accounts officers have also been asked to give the undertaking or face termination.

 The executives belong to various departments like telecom, accounts, civil and architecture. It they do not take the initiative, several functions ? especially maintenance and restoration ? of the departments get affected.

 However, the employees stayed defiant. ?We refuse to give an undertaking and ask the management to consider us terminated,? said Amit Gupta, the state secretary of the All India BSNL Employees Association, West Bengal Branch. ?The management can try and run the company without us.?

 The various unions of BSNL have joined hands to form the United Forum for BSNL Executives, which is representing the executives. The executives are demanding implementation of a time-bound promotion clause mentioned in an agreement during absorption into BSNL from department of telecommunications.

 The agitation began with a three-day hunger strike on March 15 along with an agenda for indefinite non-cooperation and work-to-rule policy by 50,000 executives across the country. In Bengal, around 4,000 executives have joined the agitation.

 On the fifth day of the agitation, subscribers in the city continued to face problems in connecting to mobile phones and making long-distance calls. Services in the districts and small towns were severely affected with almost all major trunk routes remaining inaccessible.

 Other services that are affected include railway reservation, leased lines and account-free Internet. Cash collection at some BSNL centres was also affected. The executives have, however, assured that they would repair faults in emergency cases and try to keep the network running.

 3000 lie in wait to kill robbers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 2: About 3,000 residents threw a cordon around their village, close to the border in Nadia, last night and lay in wait for daybreak to catch robbers who had raided the house of a local hero. 

 Hours after the sun came out, four members of the gang lay dead.

 The villagers spotted them trying to sneak out in ones and twos with their booty, which included a TV set, a VCD player and two briefcases packed with valuables. 

 Chased by men armed with rods, lathis, bricks and other weapons from all directions, the gang had virtually nowhere to go. But four of it still managed to escape.

 The residents of Gajna near Hanskhali, 80 km from Calcutta, were all the more angry as the robbers had struck the house of Jagadish Mondal, a CRPF jawan killed in a mine blast in Tripura a year ago.

 Additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh, who rushed to Hanskhali with a large force, said the four lynched were Bangladeshis and notorious across the border. They had tried to finish off this midnight operation in silence. Jagadishs brother Shyamal and his 60-year-old mother Debola were asleep. But Debola somehow woke up and raised an alarm when the robbers were on their way out.

 The villagers found it im- possible to locate the gang in the dark. Instead, they formed a human chain around Gajna.

 Around 5 am, they saw three men trying to edge towards the village border lugging behind them the TV set and the briefcases. The villagers used bamboo sticks and whatever they could lay their hands on to beat them up. The fourth was caught around 7 am. He was lynched in minutes, the police officer said.

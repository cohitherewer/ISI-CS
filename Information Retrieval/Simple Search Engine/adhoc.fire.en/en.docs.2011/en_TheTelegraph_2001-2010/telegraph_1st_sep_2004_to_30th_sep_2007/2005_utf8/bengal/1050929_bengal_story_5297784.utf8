 Poll in sight, CPM glare on project pile-up

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bhattacharjee: Election push

 Calcutta, Sept 28: The CPM leadership will meet its 29 ministers in the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee cabinet on Friday to enquire about pending projects in their respective departments.

 CPM insiders said the move to clear the projects follows a decision on the part of the party leadership to launch a campaign for the 2006 Assembly polls after the pujas. The leadership will also ascertain from its ministers if the projects can be completed before next April.

 All the ministers and the chief minister will attend the meeting at the party headquarters on Alimuddin Street. Cottage and small-scale industries minister Bansagopal Chowdhury who is contesting the Asansol Lok Sabha elections, may not attend the meeting.

 It is expected that Bhattacharjee will brief his cabinet colleagues and the leadership about the outcome of his recent trip to Indonesia and Singapore, as he did not get an opportunity to do so. Later, he will also brief the other ministers of the 42-member cabinet.

 Sources said the chief minister could not brief the ministers in last months cabinet meeting as finance minister Asim Dasgupta and land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla were involved in a debate over construction of a guest house at Bedi Bhavan in south Calcutta.

 The CPM will bank on Bhattacharjees drive for industrialisation and is planning to make it a major issue in next years Assembly polls, the sources said. In doing so, the party wants all the ministers to rally behind Bhattacharjee.

 It is learnt that the proposed projects by the Salim group will feature in the meeting on Friday. Two ministers ? land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla and transport minister Subhas Chakraborty ? had initially voiced their protest against Bhattacharjees plan to allow conversion of farm lands for industries.

 However, Molla came around to speak in favour of setting up industries after party veteran Jyoti Basu prevailed on him. The state leadership also promised him that farmers whose lands will be taken over by the Salim Group will be adequately compensated.

 The CPM will also emphasise improving the functioning of the panchayats and involve them in the rural health care system more effectively.

 Rural electrification is another major issue which the party leadership wants to highlight in its poll campaign. The drive for rural electrification has suffered a setback despite the partys stress on it in the past few years.

 The CPM leadership had assigned Sujan Chakraborty to carry out the job but after he was elected MP from Jadavpur last year, he left the post of the chairman of the rural electrification board. The CPM wants to engage a heavyweight party functionary for the job.

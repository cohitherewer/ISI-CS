 Subrata generous, so is Cong

 Calcutta, May 3: Mayor Subrata Mukherjee today offered 50 per cent of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation seats to the Congress. 

 He called on former Bengal Congress president Somen Mitra at his residence for the first round of seat-sharing talks in the presence of state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya.

 The mayor broke away from the Trinamul Congress last week to launch the Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha ? a forum of ?secular anti-Left? parties.

 ?We had a very fruitful discussion on sharing of seats with Subrata?s anti-Left forum,? Mitra said after the meeting. ?We shall soon meet again to finalise the deal.?

 Bhattacharya said the meeting with the Trinamul mayor went down well with Congress workers across the state. ?We don?t mind offering over 50 per cent seats to Subrata?s forum. Our main concern is to ensure the CPM?s defeat in the civic polls,? he added.

 It was decided that Congress candidates who lost marginally in 2000 would be renominated, besides those elected. 

 Trinamul leader Satyanarayan Bajaj said: ?People know that the Congress cannot put up a fight against ally CPM.?

 Tourists teeming to see Nobel II 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Santiniketan, May 8: A day before Rabindranath Tagores birth anniversary, tourists thronged Visva-Bharati to see the gold duplicate of his Nobel medal that arrived here yesterday. 

 The gold duplicate and its bronze replica are now on display at Bichitra, the room next to the Rabindra Bhavan museum from where the original medal was stolen in March last year.

 For the first time since 1936, Tagores birth anniversary is being celebrated by Visva-Bharati on Ponchishey Baisakh (Baisakh 25 by the Bengali calender). The poet himself had ruled that his birthday would be observed on Baisakh 1 because intense heat in May led to water scarcity in Birbhum those days and the institution closed for summer vacation on May 1. Visva-Bharati has been following the tradition. 

 Scarcity of water is no longer a problem on the campus and so the university authorities decided to close the institution for summer on May 15 this year. 

 ?We decided to visit Santiniketan realising that we should not miss the happy occasion. Happy, not only because of the return of the medal, though a duplicate, but also because of the anniversary celebrations tomorrow,? said Shyama Prasad Bhattacharya, who came from Kanchrapara in North 24-Parganas. 

 Sudipta Mukherjee, who came from Dhanbad with friends, said: ?Its a great opportunity to revel in the birthday celebrations... Were also happy to see the medals again.?

 Varsity officials said the gold medal would be stashed in a strong-room vault after tomorrow. The bronze replica will be displayed in a thick glass show box especially made for the purpose. 

 A guard will be specially deployed for the bronze replica in the museum during tourists visiting hours, Visva-Bharati sources said. ?We are planning to display the gold medal only occasionally,? said vice-chancellor Sujit Basu.

 A move is also on to shift the museum from the first floor of the building to the ground floor by Baishe Shravan (the poets death anniversary on August 8). 

 Basu has written to the chief minister seeking more security for the medals. The government has already provided about a dozen personnel for the Uttarayan complex.

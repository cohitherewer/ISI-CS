 Trapped in lift on road

 Calcutta, Aug. 20: Three persons, including a 10-year-old, were trapped for nearly an hour inside a lift of the citys first overbridge with walkway, says a staff reporter. 

 The lift stopped midway around 4.40 pm when Sushmita Chatterjee, her daughter Srijani and Sanjay Sardar, the guard of the footbridge, were inside. 

 The crowd below the bridge at the crossing of Rashbehari Avenue and Council Road in the Gariahat area raised an alarm and informed police. Three fire tenders were called and the trio rescued after an hour. 

 Tuhin Bera, mayor in-council (roads), said the project is incomplete and it is surprising people were allowed in.

 Trio thrashed

 Barasat, Sept. 29: Residents of Bamungachhi here in North 24-Parganas caught hold of three men who were alle- gedly running a liquor den and a prostitution racket and beat them up this morning. 

 Barasat subdivisional police officer S.M.H. Mirza said the goons were rescued from the mob and hospitalised. Residents alleged that they were forced to take the law into their own hands as repeated complaints to the police had fallen on deaf ears.

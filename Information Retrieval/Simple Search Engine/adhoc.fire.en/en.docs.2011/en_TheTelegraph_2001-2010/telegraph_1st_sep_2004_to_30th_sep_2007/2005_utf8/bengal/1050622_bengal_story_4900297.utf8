 In red sea, Trinamul finds an island 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Uttarpara, June 21: After the drubbing in Calcutta and Salt Lake, the name Uttarpara-Kotrang will ring like sweet music in Mamata Banerjees ears.

 Trinamul retained the municipality, the oldest civic body in Bengal, with as big a margin as five years ago. 

 It bagged 17 wards and the Left Front six ? the CPM five and the CPI one. 

 The beleaguered Congress that had won in two wards last time, lost one to the CPM and held on to the other.

 In a year of Left sweep in the civic polls, the fronts defeat here is being viewed by observers as its failure to stem infighting between factions owing allegiance to CPM members of Parliament Rupchand Pal and Anil Basu and the consequent cracks in the organisation. 

 Insiders said that as a result of the feud, a section of the cadre stayed away from campaigning at the grassroots level. Star speakers like Jyoti Basu, state party secretary Anil Biswas and transport minister Subhas Chakraborty thus had little impact on the outcome.

 Hooghly CPM secretary Binod Das could not conceal his disappointment. We are astounded by the tally. Since 1977, the municipality had been under Left control. Last time, Trinamul wrested it from us. This time, too, we have cut a sorry figure. 

 We need to sit together and find ways to strengthen our organisation, he added. 

 In last years Lok Sabha polls, the CPM MP from Serampore, Shantasree Chatterjee, had lagged behind his nearest rival in the 24 wards of Uttarpara-Kotrang, he said. 

 Today, Chatterjee said an inquiry would be carried out into the partys dismal performance. Allegations of sabotage will be looked into.

 However, observers also said that residents in this corner of Hooghly, only about 20 km from Calcutta ? once considered a Left bastion ? had voted for Trinamul to protest against the earlier CPM-led boards alleged nexus with realtors and the inability to improve the quality of life. 

 The Trinamul civic body provided the basic amenities. It appears that we, as opposition, were not very constructive, confessed a CPM leader who did not want to be named. 

 During campaign, the Trinamul leaders highlighted their success in water supply, street lighting, improvement of roads, collection of garbage and free treatment for men over 65 and women over 60. 

 Former municipality chairman Pinaki Dhamali said there was no room for complacency. We will continue the good work, he said, adding that the municipality was financially solvent and could pay Rs 6 lakh annually to the Calcutta Metropolitan Water and Sanitation Authority for filtered water supply. We did not impose water tax on the people. This way, we earned their faith.

 Voter list scare for fugitives

 Calcutta, Nov. 2: In view of the Narayan Biswas case, Bengals chief electoral officer Debashish Sen has sought the Election Commissions instructions on deletion of names of peoples representatives from electoral rolls if they are not ordinarily resident at their addresses for over six months.

 The EC has told us that people against whom non-bailable warrants havent been executed in the last six months are deemed as not ordinarily resident during that period and hence their names should be deleted from the list. However, Section 20 (1A) of the Representation of Peoples Act grants an exemption to MLAs and MPs during their tenure.

 According to this Section, MPs and MLAs will be deemed ordinarily resident even if they cannot stay in their constituencies during their tenure because of official work elsewhere. Hence, we need instructions from the EC on how to proceed in these cases, Sen said.

 If the name of Biswas, who has been evading arrest for 16 years, is struck off the electoral rolls on this ground, he will be barred from contesting elections, officials said.

 Sen has also kicked off the process of sending notices to persons against whom warrants are pending for years. We have already sent notices to two to three per cent of the 72,000 persons (against whom warrants are pending) in the last three days. Our target is to cover a major portion of them by November 15, he said.

 Those against whom notices have been served will have to appear before the electoral registration officers within seven days of their receipt.

 While the former minister of state for cottage and small-scale industries surrendered at Balurghat today, there is a scramble among members of other parties, too, to seek anticipatory bail in connection with pending cases.

 Trinamul Congress legislator Sobhandeb Chattopadhayay said he would seek anticipatory bail in a 1991 case in which he was accused of ransacking the office of the Baruipur block development officer in South 24 Parganas.

 Former mayor Subrata Mukherjee said he was recently cleared in a case pending for 30 years. But I am scared about any other cases pending with other courts, he added. 

 Congress sources said the party will get Behrampore MP Adhir Chowdhury and his wife Arpita to surrender soon in a twin murder case.

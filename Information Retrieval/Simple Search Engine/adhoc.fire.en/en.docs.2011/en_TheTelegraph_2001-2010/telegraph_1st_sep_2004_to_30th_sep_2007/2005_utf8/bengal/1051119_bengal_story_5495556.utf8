 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Nov. 18: The Election Commission today communicated to the states chief electoral officer that MLAs and MPs having arrest warrants pending against them will have to appear before the local electoral registration officer if they want their names retained on voters lists. 

 The legislators would have to state that they had been absent from their house in course of their normal duties and not because they were evading arrest. If the electoral registration officer is able to confirm this declaration from the absconding politician, the name will not be struck off the rolls.

 Burdwan: The acting chief judicial magistrate of the district court here ordered police on Friday to probe the death of Dolly Munshi, 32, after a surgery in a nursing home last week. Her husband Afroz had moved court after the police refused to accept his complaint against the surgeon and the nursing home.

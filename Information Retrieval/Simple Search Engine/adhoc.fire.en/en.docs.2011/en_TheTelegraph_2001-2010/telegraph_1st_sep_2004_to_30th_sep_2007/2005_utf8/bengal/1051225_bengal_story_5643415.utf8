 Green guns boom at army brass

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Dec. 24: The custodian has failed in its duty; it is now time for the court to take up the cudgels.

 Even as the formal order permitting Co-ordination Committee, a CPM-backed body of government employees, to hold its golden jubilee rally at Brigade Parade Grounds arrived from Delhi this evening, environmentalists voiced outrage at the manner in which the Maidan was allowed to be ?devastated?. 

 The green lobby today expressed reservations on the Indian Army?s competence in preserving the Maidan and called for Calcutta High Court?s intervention in protecting the city?s lungs. 

 ?This is outrageous. The army authorities have neither guidelines nor rules. As custodians, they?ve gone too far and have overlooked public interest completely,? said Justice Bhagwati Prasad Banerjee, who as a high court judge had presided over the green bench.

 ?The Maidan is public property and it should be brought directly under the purview of the high court, which should prescribe a clear set of guidelines. As custodian, the army is only creating uncertainties,? Justice Banerjee said. 

 Environmentalist Subhash Dutta echoed him.

 ?We are seeking a code of conduct for use of the Maidan and open spaces in the city. An expert committee appointed by the high court should lay down the code,? said Dutta.

 According to the green activist, the army?s recent discriminatory attitude in allowing only some fairs on the Maidan has created confusion. 

 ?The army seems to be allowing fairs and other programmes when the state government seeks its approval or jointly organises the fairs. This is not done. There should be one policy for all,? Dutta said. 

 S.M. Ghosh, who had filed a public interest litigation in the high court over rising pollution in the city, also agreed. 

 ?The army?s handling of the Brigade issue has been abysmal. We need a disciplined policy on the use of the Maidan. Let the high court prescribe guidelines. 

 ?I believe that once the high court gives a direction, the army is bound to follow it. The army will at least do a better job than the government,? Ghosh said.

 Army officials at Fort William today said they conveyed the permission after receiving the go-ahead from the ministry of defence.

 ?The matter was not in our hands. Permission came from a higher authority in Delhi,? an army official said.

 In the recommendations made by the expert committee appointed by the green bench in 2000, the military was advised not to allow waste and leaves to be burnt on the Maidan. 

 However, the practice continues even today, Dutta said. 

 ?The Maidan is the only stretch of green still surviving in the heart of the city. Trees are dwindling and bio-diversity in this area has suffered tremendously. There is simply too much human interference here and it cannot take any more. The Maidan should be left alone,? said Kushal Mukherjee of the NGO, Prakriti Samsad.

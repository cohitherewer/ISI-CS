 Mamata stokes tacit ties with Congress 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Krishnagar, Jan. 19: Days after Manmohan Singh 

invited Mamata Banerjee to join his cabinet, the Trinamul Congress leader today 

indicated that her party might enter into an understanding with the Congress at 

the grassroots level to counter the communists.

 ?I am aware that some Congress leaders in Nadia had secretly formed a mahajot and backed our party nominee to try and defeat the CPM candidate in the Nabadwip parliamentary seat last May. A similar understanding is possible this time in the coming elections to the four municipalities ? Nabadwip, Santipur, Taherpur and Birnagar ? slated for June. I want Congress leaders here to repeat it during next year?s Assembly polls,? Mamata said at a moderate rally here. 

 In the last Lok Sabha elections, the Nadia Congress, led by chief Shankar Singh, entered into a tacit understanding with Trinamul to defeat the CPM candidate. Though Trinamul lost, its nominee emerged as a force. 

 Mamata was pleased some Congress leaders considered her party as the ?real anti-CPM force?. ?I would request the Congress workers to join our party instead of backing us from behind. However, they are welcome to help us by indirectly forming an alliance,? she added. 

 The Trinamul chief made it clear that she would not return to the Congress ?which has formed the government at the Centre with the CPM?s support?. She recounted how she was expelled from the party six years ago just for ?raising our voice against activities of some state Congress leaders for having an understanding with the CPM?.

 Encouraged by Mamata, Nadia Trinamul leaders said they would not mind initiating secret parleys with Congress leaders to work out a tacit electoral understanding for the elections to the municipalities.

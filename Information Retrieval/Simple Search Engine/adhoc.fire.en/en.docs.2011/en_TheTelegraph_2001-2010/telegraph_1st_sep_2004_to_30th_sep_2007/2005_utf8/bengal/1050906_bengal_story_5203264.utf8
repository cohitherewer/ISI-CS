 Court sets trial deadline

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 5: The high court today asked a lower court to complete within six months the trial of 70 allegedly involved in the murder of nine persons, four of them the sons of a 70-year-old who has been running pillar to post for justice about 24 years ago.

 It is due to the callousness on the part of police, an old woman, who lost four sons in 1981, has been crying for justice for so many years, Justice P.N. Sinha said.

 The snub to the state administration follows the disappearance and reappearance of the case diary.

 On August 18, 1981, a mob of nearly 500 people attacked a house at Kota in Birbhum, about 120 km from Calcutta, around 4 pm when a family discussion was taking place inside.

 The mob locked the rooms from outside and then set Anwara Bibis sons ? Anwar Seikh, Amanul Seikh, Noor Hossien and Gulam Seikh ? five other relatives and the house on fire.

 The case came up for hearing when in April Anwara submitted a written complaint to chief justice V.S. Sirpurkar that the trial against the killers has been pending since 1996. Despite all her efforts, neither the court nor the investigating authorities had heard her appeal, she informed Sirpurkar .

 Anwara said she had then lodged a complaint with Kota police and a trial against 70 people started in a Suri court. The court framed charges against all the accused, but the trial has been pending since.

 In June this year, Sirpurkar had assigned Justice Sinha to hear the case. The Suri court informed Sinha that the trial could not proceed as the authorities had not produced the case diary. 

 Birbhum superintendent of police Sanjoy Singh told the court that the earlier investigation officer had retired and the case diary was with him. The officers present address is not available, he said.

 Sinha then directed the authorities to find the diary. 

 Today, public prosecutor Kazi Safiullah told the judge that the police had discovered the diary. An enraged Sinha rapped the state authorities and asked the additional sessions judge to complete the trial in six months.

 Mind your heart for memory

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Calcutta, Jan. 29: Hypertension at 35 could well mean dementia by 65 unless blood pressure is kept in check and stress minimised.

 Results of one of the biggest surveys conducted by city doctors and a just-published research work (January 25) by the American Academy of Neurology co-relating hypertension with dementia and Alzheimer?s disease has sent neurologists into a tizzy.

 ?It is not just a coincidence that we have also found that hypertension along with dementia is increasing sharply in Calcutta. Stressful lives and ignorance among Calcuttans about the risks of hypertension has become a major issue,? said Shyamal Das, a neurologist and researcher at the Bangur Institute of Neurology.

 Having found evidence of increasing cases of the two diseases, Das and other researchers will embark on a bigger study to find out more about the link between the two. Hypertension is a common chronic disorder and studies have revealed a 70-80 per cent chance of a healthy human being developing it after 30.

 About a third of the city?s population is hypertensive. Neurologists say hypertension has remained largely undiagnosed in the past two decades.

 Similarly, dementia, which causes acute memory loss, has also increased manifold with almost 650 cases being reported for every 100,000 people. ?There is no doubt that cases of hypertension along with dementia and Alzheimer?s disease have been increasing significantly in the city and we are taking fresh stock of the situation,? said Tapas Banerjee, the head of neuromedicine at the National Neurosciences Centre, who is part of the study.

 Commissioned in 2002 by the Indian Council of Medical Research, the survey of neurological ailments involves 53,000 Calcuttans and agencies like the Indian Statistical Institute, the National Neurosciences Centre and the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health.

 Das said: ?Only three out of 100 Calcuttans monitor blood pressure regularly or have medicines to avoid chronic effects 10 years later.? He added that ?blood pressure can be easily monitored at home, but patients hardly comply and only come to us when it is too late?.

 Hypertension is a major cause of strokes, heart failures, chronic kidney diseases, atheriosclerosis and dementia. Almost 15-30 per cent of all chronic kidney failures are caused by hypertension.

 Inspired by Roma abductors, teenagers kill five-year-old boy

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Lalgola, Feb. 20: The abduction season claimed another victim last night in five-and-a-half-year-old Tofail Ahmed, who left home to play with friends never to return.

 Tofail ? Sagar to friends and family ? the son of a stationery shop owner at Lalgola, 250 km from Calcutta, was killed hours after his sister Ruksana received the ransom call last evening because the family went to police. 

 The force swung into action and one of the kidnappers, Entaz Sheikh, was arrested. But the damage had been done. Jaidul Sheikh and Bapi Sheikh, who were guarding Tofail, killed him the moment they realised the police were zeroing in. Entaz?s statements led the force to a bush near the Lalgola open-air jail around Saturday midnight, where Tofail lay dead.

 Jaidul and Bapi were picked up soon after. The trio, neighbourhood boys aged between 16 and 18, confessed to the police that they committed the crime for quick money.

 At 5 yesterday afternoon, Tofail left home to play with friends. Around 6.30, one of the kidnappers called up his home demanding Rs 30,000. His sister Ruksana took the call. ?Pulishe khabar na diye babake taka jogar korte bolo. Chalaki korle, bhaier body chhara kichhu pabe na (Ask your father to arrange the money instead of going to the police. Don?t play tricks or you?ll only get your brother?s body),? said the caller. 

 An officer of the Lalgola police station said: ?It was a gruesome killing. They gouged out the right eye and hit his head with a dagger before strangulating him.?

 This is the third incident in the state in about two months in which teenagers have been charged with murder. 

 Entaz, Jaidul and Bapi told the police that they drew inspiration from the Roma Jhawar kidnap last month. The family of the college girl from Salt Lake in Calcutta paid several lakhs to secure her release, but most of the culprits in that case, too, are in the net. 

 Entaz said: ?Roma?s kidnappers asked for Rs 20 lakh and got it. We asked for only Rs 30,000 because we knew Sagar?s father (Badirul Islam), who runs a stationery shop near Lalgola station, cannot afford more.? 

 An officer on the case said they had planned to bag the money and move to Mumbai to work as labourers.

 Murshidabad superintendent Sanjay Singh said those held do not have a criminal past. ?A probe is on to find out if a professional gang was also part of the plot.?

 Cop killed for doing his duty

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Purulia, June 10: A police officer was killed last evening for having refused to hand over an alleged motorcycle thief to the angry residents of a village about 70 km from here.

 The residents of Nituri attacked assistant sub-inspector Parameswar Soren and two accompanying constables about 280 km from Calcutta.

 Police said Haramohan Banerjee, a businessman, was returning home on his motorcycle around 5 pm when a duo forced him to part with the two-wheeler at gunpoint.

 As they tried to flee along the Purulia-Asansol highway, a police patrol comprising Soren and constables Kishan Chatterjee and Bhola Prasad intercepted them. The two claimed that they had left behind the vehicles papers by mistake.

 Soren told one of them to fetch them and detained the other along with the vehicle. Banerjee, who was going past, riding pillion on another motorcycle, recognised the youth and told the police he had been robbed of his vehicle earlier. The police trio then set out for Banerjees home looking for the other thief. By then, a 150-strong mob had assembled and some from it tried to snatch the miscreant.

 Soren, Chatterjee and Prasad, who refused to hand over the thief to the mob, stood their ground and the people turned violent. 

 A large contingent from the Nituri police station came to the rescue. But Soren, who was shifted to a nursing home in Asansol, died around midnight. The constables were released after first-aid.

 A resident of Bandwan, Soren had survived a landmine blast triggered by Naxalites in 2003. The officer-in-charge of the police station there, Nilmadhab Das, was killed.

 District police chief R. Shiv Kumar visited Nituri today. Six people have been arrested. 

 Additional director-general, law and order, Chayan Mukherjee said in Calcutta Soren, 58, suffered a heart attack.

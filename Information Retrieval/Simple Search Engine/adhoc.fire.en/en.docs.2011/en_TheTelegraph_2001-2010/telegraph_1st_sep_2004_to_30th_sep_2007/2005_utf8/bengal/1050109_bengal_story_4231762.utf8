 Beaten gateman?s wife writes to Laloo

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Beldanga, Jan. 8: The wife of the gateman who was beaten up by police personnel escorting director-general of police Shyamal Dutta has written to railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav demanding exemplary punishment to those responsible and proper medical treatment for her husband.

 On January 4, Mohammad Musharaf Hossain had refused to open the gate at a crossing near Krishnanagar station to let the convoy of Dutta, who was returning to Calcutta after inaugurating a police barracks, through as a train was expected to pass. The railway employee was then beaten up by the police official?s escorts.

 On Thursday, Nadia police authorities suspended a senior sub-inspector of Kotwali police station, Sanjit Chakraborty, for beating up Hossain.

 ?My husband is a railway employee and he was on duty. The way he was beaten up, he could have been killed. I immediately want my husband?s medical treatment and exemplary punishment of those responsible,? Hossainara Begum said.

 Hossainara ? a resident of Uttarpara village in the Beldanga area of Murshidabad district, 180 km from Calcutta ? said her husband, who took leave and left for his village yesterday, is very ill.

 ?His neck has become so stiff that he cannot turn it. I want him to be treated properly by a good doctor. I also want the policemen punished severely. That is why I wrote to the railway minister,? she said.

 ?I heard one policeman has been suspended. But a suspension will not do. Those responsible will have to be driven out of the police force. I have requested the railway minister to also take steps in this regard,? asserted Hossainara.

 Fifty-year-old Hossain said he had just closed the level-crossing gate around 12.50 pm on Tuesday when a police vehicle screeched to a halt.

 ?A policeman in uniform got out from the car and ordered me to open the gate. He told me his boss will pass. But it was not possible for me to open the gate as I, too, have a job to save. Then two policemen started beating me up and threw me to the ground. I was severely hurt in the neck,? he said.

 Hossain said he had tried to reason with the policemen and told them that when Mamata Banerjee was the railway minister, her convoy, too, while passing the same level crossing had come across a closed gate and waited patiently for the train to pass. ?Why can?t your boss wait?? Hossain had asked the policemen.

 The Murshidabad district magistrate, N. Manjunatha Prasad, said he did not know that Hossain is a resident of Beldanga. ?However, if Hossain or his wife lodge any complaint with me, I will send it across to the appropriate railway authorities,? Prasad said.

 Nadia district magistrate Rajesh Pandey had said on Thursday that Chakraborty was suspended after a preliminary investigation found him guilty of beating up the railway gateman.

 ?The sub-inspector was the seniormost officer present there and the charges levelled are serious. The administration cannot sit idle, quot; he said and asked the police to thoroughly probe the incident.

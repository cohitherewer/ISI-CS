 Biman balm on littered Maidan

 Calcutta, Feb. 12: Mounds of book fair litter had barely been carted away when the CPM faithful marched to the Maidan to answer the call of their leaders and left the greens bruised and buried under a deluge of newspapers, packets, plastic and earthen cups and leftover food. 

 Since the book fair ended six days ago, the Publishers and Booksellers? Guild had been struggling to clean up the mess ? one of the primary reasons behind the high court?s insistence that the fairs be moved off the Maidan to a permanent venue. They took their time, but finally, the organisers of India?s biggest book fair had managed to get the garbage gathered up, ready to be carried away. 

 This afternoon, they were in for a shock. They found that the book fair venue, adjacent to the portion of the Maidan where the CPM held fort today, was packed with rally participants. They were busy munching jhal muri, sipping tea and littering the place. 

 ?We had already cleaned up a large portion of the book fair venue and accumulated the garbage in one corner. But today we found that people flocked to this part and made the place look uglier than before. Now who will be responsible for the additional litter? Who will clear this mess?? a guild official asked. 

 By his own admission, Biman Bose will. At the end of the rally, the Left Front chairman said: ?Political parties and non-political organisations hold rallies and meetings over here and they litter the place before leaving. However, we promise to clean up the place in the next 24 hours.? 

 He appealed to volunteers to see to it that the litter is removed. 

 Environmental activist Subhas Dutta praised Bose?s gesture. ?I will go to the Maidan tomorrow to see for myself how much clean-up work has been done in the portion where the CPM?s meeting was held today as well as the book fair venue,? said Dutta, whose petition had turned Calcutta High Court?s attention to the plight of Calcutta?s lungs. After his trip, he would submit a report to the high court. 

 The clean-up deadline of February 14 just two days away, work at the book fair venue was on in full swing. But heaps of bamboo, ropes, pieces of plywood and other material used to set up the stalls were lying around. Several electricity poles and a transformer were still to be removed. 

 The guild official said most of the work was over and the area would be handed over to Calcutta police and the army on February 14. 

 The police had extended the guild?s deadline by four days when they realised that cleaning up and revival of the ground could not be completed by February 10. 

 With the passage of time, guild authorities are almost elated with a huge amount of the accumulated garbage being gradually removed by rag pickers. 

 ?Till last year, the CMC used to remove the garbage from the day following the fair?s conclusion. This year, they haven?t cleaned the garbage yet, but a large number of rag pickers are taking away parts of the litter over the last few days,? said Sudhangshu Dey, the guild?s ground convener. 

 According to guild authorities, CMC was given Rs 18,000 for lifting the garbage from the same venue after last year?s fair. ?If the CMC doesn?t clean up the remaining garbage by Monday, we?ll approach them again,? Dey said. 

 But he can expect non-cooperation. ?We want to sever ties with the guild if they don?t pay us amusement tax,? said mayor Subrata Mukherjee.

 BRIEFS

 Asansol, Feb. 11: Aditya Singhal, the 15-year-old son of a Barakar businessman who rode a motorcycle, toted a cellphone and was booted out of school, is missing.

 His father, Anantlal, lodged a diary at Kulti police station, 270 km from Calcutta, saying he is missing since Wednesday but did not claim that he was abducted. The police, too, are not saying so. There was no call for ransom, said an officer. But Maniklal Acharya, the Forward Bloc MLA from Kulti, claimed family members told him about a demand for Rs 1 crore. 

 The police are probing the possibility of Aditya ?staging a kidnap? for money. Niraj Singh, the Burdwan police chief, said: ?At this moment, we cannot call it kidnapping. We are surprised by the boy?s record ? he is an alcoholic who frequents red-light areas.? Aditya had left home saying he was going for tuition, though he did not have a class. His friends, many of them girls, are being questioned. 

 Behrampore: Goutam Chakraborty, a traffic police officer-in-charge, and constables Dipak Chatterjee and Pramod Saha were suspended on Friday for allegedly extorting money from truck drivers the night before. Murshidabad police chief Sanjay Singh said they were identified by residents when taking bribe at Girja More in Behrampore town, 200 km from Calcutta. Arun Ghosh, 30, was knocked down on National Highway 34 when a truck suddenly picked up speed trying to avoid the trio.

 Calcutta: Eighteen children aged between seven and 14 lodged in Kishalay, the state-run home for destitute children in Barasat, North 24-Parganas, fled early on Friday morning. Eight of them were tracked down by members of a local club. Between August and January, 13 children fled the home that houses 170. The latest was detected during the regular role-call, said an official .

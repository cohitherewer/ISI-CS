 Refusal glare on hospitals

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 20: Two days after alleged apathy caused five-year-old Riya Das to die at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital, the health department has swung into action.

 All teaching hospitals in the city were today asked to provide details about the infrastructure in key departments, including paediatrics, and specify the steps being taken to ensure such an incident is not repeated.

 Hospitals have also been asked to give details of doctors, especially those attached to the paediatric wards, their duty schedule and the number of patients referred to other hospitals in the last one month with an explanation as to why they were not admitted.

 RG Kar will have to prepare a separate report on Riyas death and submit it by Wednesday. 

 Riya was brought to RG Kar by her father Kebol on Thursday morning. The girl had high temperature and was bleeding from the nose and mouth. 

 Turned away twice before ? on Tuesday and Wednesday ? Riyas parents had hoped that they would be third time lucky. But before she could be admitted to the hospitals paediatrics department, the girl swooned and died in the emergency ward.

 The authorities at the medical college were told the report should not be an eye-wash and should contain all information, including the names of those on duty at the time of the girls admission, who had referred her to the emergency ward on previous occasions and the circumstances leading to her death.

 Instead of entrusting the job to one doctor, the authorities have been asked to set up a three-member committee to prepare the report. 

 We are not ready to take a slip-shod report. The death of Riya is very unfortunate and someone has to take the responsibility. However, since this is an internal matter, I would not like to discuss it with the media, said Jayshree Mitra, the director of medical education. 

 The health departments move comes on a day Mitra went to RG Kar and later to Medical College this morning for an on-the-spot evaluation of the state of affairs. 

 At RG Kar, Mitra went around the paediatrics department and held talks with doctors, including the head of the department. Insiders said she also asked about the doctor who had first turned away Riya saying she was not a fit case for admission.

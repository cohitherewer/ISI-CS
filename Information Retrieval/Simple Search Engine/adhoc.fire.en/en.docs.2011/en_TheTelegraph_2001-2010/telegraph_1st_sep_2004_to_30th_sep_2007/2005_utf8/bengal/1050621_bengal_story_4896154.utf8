 Cong votes Left to power

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhadreswar, June 20: What happened in Maldas Englishbazar municipality two days ago repeated itself in Hooghly today. 

 An Opposition councillor paved the way for a CPM candidate to head the civic body here this afternoon. 

 Although the Left Front has held the reins of the 20-member board since 1977, there was a tie after the elections last month with both the front and the Opposition ? Congress and Trinamul Congress ? bagging 10 wards each. 

 Even in todays election for chairman, the fronts Debgopal Chakraborty and Trinamuls Mahendra Pratap Singh got 10 votes each. But Chakraborty edged out his rival after the CPMs Mohammed Israil, who was conducting the poll, cast his vote for Chakraborty.

 The Congress and Trinamul have five councillors each on the 20-member board. The CPM has eight and the CPI one. The other councillor is a front-backed Independent. 

 On Saturday, a front-backed Independent, Nihar Ghosh, was elected chairman of the Englishbazar civic body with two votes from the Opposition ranks. A Congress and Trinamul councillor are believed to have voted for the Left there. 

 The front nominee got 13 votes, though it had only 11 councillors. The Trinamul candidate got 12. 

 In Bhadreswar, Israil locked horns with the Congresss Ratan Golder over who should conduct the election. In a secret ballot, the CPM leader polled 11 votes to earn the right to conduct the chairmans election. Round I gave enough indication of what would follow.

 One of the five Congress councillors must have voted for Israil to get him elected president for conducting the election so that he could vote for the front in the event of a tie. That is what happened, said district Trinamul leader Raghunath Bhowmik. 

 Singh, Trinamuls chairman candidate, alleged sabotage. The Congress councillor must have taken money.

 An embarrassed state Congress leadership has sought a report from the district unit. 

 We shall institute a probe after getting its report. If our man has helped the CPM candidate, disciplinary action will be taken against him, said Pradip Bhattacharya, the partys working president.

 Quota post shock to 9 teachers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Midnapore, Feb. 16: Authorities have directed a school in East Midnapore to sack nine teachers, including the headmaster, after more than eight years in service on the ground of discrepancies in their recruitment. 

 ?All nine teachers were appointed to posts reserved for scheduled castes and tribes. It was made clear during the appointment that their placement was conditional as some people moved court. 

 ?In 2002, the high court cancelled the appointments but the order was not implemented for some reason. After I joined in mid-January, I came across the court order and issued the instruction,? said Prasanta Roy, the district inspector of schools (secondary). 

 The order has thrown Digha Vidyabhavan in the resort town of Digha in a tizzy. 

 President of the school managing committee Ashok Kumar Maity said they saw no option but to implement the order. 

 ?We have received the DI?s order and we have to abide by it. Even if we want to keep the teachers, we can?t because the government will stop their salaries. However, we are trying to find out the legalities,? he said.

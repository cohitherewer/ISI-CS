 Delhi date ?satisfies? Buddha 

 OUR BUREAU

 Feb. 24: A week after the tripartite meeting convened by Union home minister Shivraj Patil on the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council ended in a deadlock, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh this evening to seek the Centre?s support for the state government on Subash Ghisingh?s demands. 

 The chief minister refused to comment on the outcome of the meeting, which lasted an hour and 10 minutes, but sources said that unlike last time, he was ?satisfied?. 

 Bhattacharjee, the source said, was extremely unhappy after the tripartite meeting on February 17, at which Patil remained ?neutral?. 

 Ghisingh, who returned from Delhi today, had fielded questions at Pintail village near Siliguri. ?How much does the Bengal government, or for that matter, the Centre care if there is a Gorkhaland or not?? he asked.

 The GNLF chief iterated that the government should shelve the DGHC polls for the time being and focus on reviewing the hill council accord. 

 CM donation

 Bhattacharjee contributed Rs 4.5 crore to the Prime Minister?s National Relief Fund. He had earlier handed over a cheque for Rs 3.5 crore to Manmohan Singh when the Prime Minister visited Calcutta.

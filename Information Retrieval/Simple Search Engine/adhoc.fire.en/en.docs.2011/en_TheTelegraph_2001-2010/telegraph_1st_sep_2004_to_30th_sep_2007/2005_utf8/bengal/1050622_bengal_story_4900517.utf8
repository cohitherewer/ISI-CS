 Bag baby gets parents

 Islampur (North Dinajpur), June 21: The district judge here has awarded the judicial custody of a five-month-old baby ? rescued a month-and-a-half ago ? to judge Partha Pratim Das and his wife Buli, a childless couple. 

 Residents of Gaisal (12 km from here) saw five people walking towards Aluabari station with a gunny bag, which they suspected had a baby inside. They informed police, who rescued the baby and arrested a trio. The baby was handed over to Islampur Subdivisional Hospital. Today, the district judge ordered that the baby be in the Dases care for a month. A permanent adoption will be considered thereafter.

 SFI scoffs at minister

 OUR BUREAU

 Burdwan/Siliguri, May 28: The Students Federation of India (SFI) today shrugged off urban development minister Asok Bhattacharyas directive to call off its agitation against fee hike and collection of donations by schools in Siliguri.

 Bhattacharya, who hails from Siliguri, had asked the CPMs student wing to immediately withdraw its agitation after the death of Sonu Kumar Patel, a Class X student of Siliguri Hindi High School.

 Sonu was reportedly beaten to death by SFI activists on Wednesday for defying the SFIs strike call.

 The students death had sparked protests by local units of the Trinamul Congress, Chhatra Parishad, the Congresss student wing, as well as the Democratic Students Organisation, the student wing of the SUCI.

 Bhattacharya had urged the police to immediately arrest the persons responsible for the students death.

 Yesterday, Chhatra Parishad supporters went on a rampage at Siliguri in protest against police inaction and damaged buses and other vehicles. Police later arrested one person in connection with Sonus death.

 At a news conference in Burdwan, state SFI general secretary Apurba Chatterjee said the students wing did not require Bhattacharyas unsolicited advice.

 The SFI is a separate organisation. We are not bound to launch or withdraw our agitation according to the advice or instruction of Bhattacharya or any other member of the cabinet, he said.

 Chatterjee said the minister has no right to impose his will on the SFI in Siliguri just because he hails from the town. We are not going to accept Bhattacharyas dictates and are ready to go for a confrontation with him, if necessary. We will also submit a written complaint to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee against him.

 In Siliguri, Bhattacharya, however, said there had been a misunderstanding following reports in the media. 

 All I had said was that the SFI should refrain from going to schools with their demand for not charging donations, especially for now. Anything can happen, especially when the Opposition parties are on the lookout for another slip.

 A delegation of the district SFI met him late in the evening to iron out the differences.

 Chatterjee also claimed that the SFI had nothing to do with Sonus death. 

 The SFI has no connection with the arrested person. It is true we have been agitating. But it has nothing to do with the students death. Our organisation is being implicated with some political motive, he said.

 SFIs Darjeeling district secretary Dibakar Ray said in Siliguri that his organisation would continue with its agitation against charging of donations and development fees by schools in the region.

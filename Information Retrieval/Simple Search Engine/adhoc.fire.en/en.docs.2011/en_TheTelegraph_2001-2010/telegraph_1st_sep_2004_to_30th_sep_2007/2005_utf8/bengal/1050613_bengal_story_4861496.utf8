 Cong post-poll plot open to changes

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, June 12: Pranab Mukherjee today kept all options open for alliance with ?like-minded parties? after the people?s verdict in the June 19 civic polls becomes known.

 ?It is too early to predict any post-poll alliance. However, I want to make it clear that the Congress will not enter into any sort of alliance with communal forces if the United Democratic Alliance falls short of an absolute majority,? the state Congress president told a programme at the press club here this afternoon.

 Besides signalling the Congress?s readiness to weigh all secular alternatives after the civic polls, Mukherjee?s observation is being viewed as a warning to party functionaries who are not averse to joining forces with Mamata Banerjee to form the city civic board despite her ties with the BJP. 

 Yesterday, Trinamul Congress leaders said they were expecting Congress councillors ?who were really opposed to the CPM? to help the party form the civic board as they did in 2000. 

 Asked what the Congress will do if the CPM-led Left Front fails to get a clear majority, Mukherjee avoided a direct answer. ?Let us wait for the people?s mandate. It is not fair to predict post-poll alliances,? he said.

 The Congress has forged a pact with mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha, comprising a string of smaller parties, and formed the United Democratic Alliance. ?We are all contesting the polls under the banner of the alliance and I am confident of its victory with a thumping majority,? Pranab Mukherjee said.

 Rejecting opinion polls that have predicted the Left Front?s victory, he said: ?If pollsters had the last word, there would be no need for elections.? 

 Such polls, he added, may have relevance when they are conducted, but, on the day of polling, the picture might change. ?I am not rejecting it, but it cannot be accepted as gospel truth.?

 He dismissed reports about his confidential note to Congress president Sonia Gandhi saying it was almost impossible to ensure the CPM?s defeat in Bengal. ?This is propaganda against us. We are putting up a united fight in all 141 wards under the UDA?s banner,? Pranab Mukherjee said. 

 The alliance, he said, is projecting Subrata Mukherjee as a mayor candidate because of his successful five-year stint at the helm of the civic body. ?We believe in democracy and that is why we are telling people much before the polls who should be our team manager,? he added. 

 The state Congress chief believes it is par for the course for politicians to change sides. ?It?s true that Subrata has formed the Mancha after severing ties with Mamata, but there is nothing unusual about it as political persons keep changing affiliations.? 

 Pranab Mukherjee, who was roughed up by supporters of his own party following dissent over the distribution of tickets last month, accused the CPM of making an issue of it. ?It shows bad taste when Jyoti Basu speaks on it at election meetings.?

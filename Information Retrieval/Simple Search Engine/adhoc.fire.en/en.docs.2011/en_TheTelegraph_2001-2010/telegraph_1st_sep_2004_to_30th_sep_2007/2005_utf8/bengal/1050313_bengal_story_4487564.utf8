 Jalpaiguri/Alipurduar, March 12: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said the state government is all set to develop tea tourism, which would add to the income of tea planters and also generate employment for local youths.

 ?We have found that there are several tourists, both domestic and international, who are interested in visiting the tea gardens. The idea of developing tea tourism has been a hit in Indonesia from where we adopted the policy as there are similar resources in this part of Bengal,? Bhattacharjee said while unveiling the tea tourism policy at the Central Dooars Club this evening.

 ?We have received Rs 7.9 crore from the Union tourism ministry for this purpose,? he said. ?We have thought of developing infrastructure, such as roads, drinking water and electricity, in certain tea estates of north Bengal that are situated in exotic locales,? Bhattacharjee said.

 The chief minister urged tea planters to come forward to develop the tourism sector in north Bengal. ?We want to develop parts of north Bengal apart from Darjeeling hills as tourist destinations. Adoption of the tea tourism policy is part of the plan,? he said at the programme organised by the Dooars branch of the Indian Tea Association in Binnaguri, 68 km from Jalpaiguri.

 In Alipurduar, Bhattacharjee today unveiled a string of projects for five north Bengal districts.

 ?There are few places in our state that are more backward than north Bengal. We are giving importance to setting up industries based on agriculture and horticulture in north Bengal. We have formed the North Bengal Development Council to undertake various projects,? he said.

 The government, the chief minister said, will set up an airport in Cooch Behar. ?We have already received Rs 20 crore from the Centre for the project. In Barobisha on the Assam-Bengal border, we are going to set up an industrial park at a cost Rs 1.5 crore.?

 Bhattacharjee declared for the first time that there could be a discussion on whether or not Rajbangshi is a separate language.

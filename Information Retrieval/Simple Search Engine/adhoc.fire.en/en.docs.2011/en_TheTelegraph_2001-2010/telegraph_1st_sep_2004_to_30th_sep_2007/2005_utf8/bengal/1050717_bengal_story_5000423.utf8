 New thieves empty fuel tanks 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 16: Driving in a jeep at night and pumping out fuel from vehicles parked in the open is the latest addi- tion to the citys crime catalogue. 

 Only yesterday, police came close to arresting the culprits giving them sleepless nights for the past few weeks. 

 This is a new invention by burglars. They come with a pipe and barrel and flee after pumping out fuel from parked vehicles. They always select the cover of darkness and have been travelling in cars, said Gyanwant Singh, a detective department deputy commissioner. We are collecting information, the thieves should be arrested soon, he added.

 Officials of the Lake police station found a jeep parked on Lake Road during a late- night vigil. 

 As we went close to the car, we spotted four youths. We chased them, but they managed to give us the slip, said an officer. During a routine search, the police found two barrels and a pipe from the spot where the jeep was parked. 

 Four buses were also parked nearby and the goons had also planned to empty their tanks, the officer said. 

 The miscreants come mostly in a jeep and select places where several private cars and commercial vehicles are parked in the open, said another officer, explaining the mode of operation. One of them crawls under the vehicle, he said. He cuts open a portion of the fuel tank. It hardly takes 15 minutes to empty a tank, the officer added.

 Many people have apparently lodged complaints with the police saying that they woke up in the morning and found no fuel in their vehicles. All the tanks in such cases had holes in them. 

 Besides cars, the prime targets for the gang are commercial vehicles ? bus, minibus, matador vans and lorries. As the owners of these vehicles always fill up their tanks before parking for the night, they are easy prey, the officer added.

 A preliminary probe has revealed that the gangs that now operate are from the city and its adjoining areas. 

 We have not been able to arrest any gang member yet because they seem to be cleverer then we had anticipated. The police stations have been alerted about the trend and asked to keep a close watch on vehicles plying late in the night with young men on board, said a senior officer at the Lalbazar police headquarters.

 Calcutta, Feb. 25: Day I of Madhyamik 2005 got mired in controversy as the secondary education board had to issue provisional admit cards at the nick of time to enable about 100 students to take the exam and make up for the alleged lapse of schools.

 The board promised ?stern action? against teachers and headmasters whose negligence had many students waiting in uncertainty to know if they were actually going to write today?s paper.

 Their wards not having received admit cards even a day before the examination, many anxious parents approached the headmasters, who got in touch with the board officials last evening. 

 Initially, the board refused to issue provisional admit cards as it had abolished the system some years ago. But it was forced to as the number of complaints kept increasing.

 Officials said some students got them minutes before today?s examination started.

 Admit cards are issued after the board receives the examination and registration forms filled up by the examinees. 

 Dibyendu Hota, the president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, said: ?Some schools did not send the examination forms simply because they had forgotten about them. Such mistakes can spoil an entire career.? 

 A central Calcutta school that collected the filled up forms months in advance ?left out nine students by mistake?. Schools in Jalpaiguri, South 24-Parganas and Hooghly also featured on this list. 

 However, despite hiccups and the anxiety, the exam day passed off peacefully for over 600,000 students.

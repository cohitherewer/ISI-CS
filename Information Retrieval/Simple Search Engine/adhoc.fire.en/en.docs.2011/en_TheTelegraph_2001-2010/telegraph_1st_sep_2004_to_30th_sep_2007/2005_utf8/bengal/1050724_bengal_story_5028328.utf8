 Farmers loans looted on highway

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, July 23: Five armed robbers waylaid a car and decamped with Rs 9.35 lakh ? meant to be disbursed to farmers as loans ? before an alarm could be raised.

 Four members of the Jhunguti Pallibandhu Samabay Samity, including manager Khudiram Hansda, were returning from the Burdwan Central Co-operative Bank in the Ambassador when the money was snatched, according to the superintendent of police, Peeyush Pandey. The money was being brought for distribution among 160 farmers as loans, Hansda said.

 The manager recounted that five youths on three motorcycles overtook the car and blocked the road near a culvert when it slowed down after turning left from the Burdwan-Guskara Road at Birpur More, about 135 km from Calcutta. The youths brandished guns and forced open the cars doors, he said.

 They snatched the bag and fled before we could react. They took only two minutes to carry out the operation, said the samity manager.

 Hansda and his samity colleagues lodged a complaint at the Burdwan police station.

 The modus operandi of the miscreants indicates that they had specific information about the transportation of the money. They must have followed the samity members after they left the co-operative bank, said Pandey.

 We have already alerted all the adjoining police stations and a massive hunt is on to track down the culprits, said the Burdwan police chief.

 Preliminary investigations indicate that those who had prior knowledge about the withdrawal of the cash from the bank must have snatched the money, said an official probing the case. The official said police patrolling would be intensified in the area.

 Residents of the area alleged that dacoities and robberies have increased over the last few months in Burdwan town and its adjoining areas.

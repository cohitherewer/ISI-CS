 Infiltrator cop ducks arrest 

 PRONAB MONDAL AND SOUMEN BHATTACHARYA

 Calcutta, July 30: When 

 lawkeepers cross the line, the long arm of law takes rest.

 As 31 people, who had crossed the Bangladesh border with an assistant sub-inspector without valid documents, cool their heels in jail, the police officer is safe at home.

 Aurobindo Kumar Sana of Park Street police station and his wife and son were spared the handcuffs when his superiors intervened and made a special request to let him go. They said he had stepped into Bangladeshi territory by mistake.

 The three, along with 31 others, were caught when they crossed over to the Indian side at Ghojadanga in Basirhat on Tuesday night. 

 He was intercepted by personnel of the Border Security Force and handed over to us for prosecution. We produced all other infiltrators in court but released Sana and his family, said a senior official of North 24-Parganas police. We had no option left after top officials from Calcutta police made a request.

 No senior official of the city police ? right from deputy commissioner (headquarters) Anuj Sharma to DC (south) N. Rameshbabu ? agreed to comment.

 The BSFs additional director-general (east), Damodar Sarengi, confirmed Sanas illegal entry. We caught him with other infiltrators and handed him over to the police with them. He could not show any proof of being an Indian national to the BSF. I dont know how he convinced policemen in Basirhat, he said. It is up to the police whom they grill or release.

 Senior officials contacted Sana immediately after he was taken to the Ghojadanga BSF camp. He told them that he had gone to the border to show his wife and child what the Bangladeshi territory looked like. I crossed the border while taking a stroll along the no-mans land and entered Bangladesh by mistake. When I was returning, BSF personnel caught me, the ASP was quoted as telling his bosses.

 North 24-Parganas police are not ready to buy Sanas story. How can we believe this explanation? Is this not a cock-and-bull story? asked a senior officer of Basirhat police station.

 Sana has been on leave since July 3. He went to his in-laws house in Khulna in Bangladesh, said a city police officer. For a passport-holding government employee, it is mandatory to inform his office about foreign trips. But Sana did not possess a passport and violated all departmental norms as well as the passport act. Now it seems he has travelled to Bangladesh without any documents several times in the recent past, he added.

 Asked whether a departmental inquiry would be initiated against Sana, senior officers stuck to the no-comments line. Sharma said the divisional DC would decide about it. 

 I havent received any report from North 24-Parganas police so far. Our next course of action will be decided only after the report reaches us, Rameshbabu said.

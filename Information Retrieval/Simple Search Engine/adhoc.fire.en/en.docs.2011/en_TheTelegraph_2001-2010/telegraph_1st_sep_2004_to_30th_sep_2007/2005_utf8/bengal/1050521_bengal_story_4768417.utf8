The Telegraph - Calcutta : Bengal

 An Opposition oasis, shhh... 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, May 20: When political circles across Bengal are agog with speculation over rifts in Trinamul ranks and discontent among Congress workers, the parties have joined hands some 100 km from Calcutta to take on the CPM.

 Not just that, the BJP is also party to the plot to take on the CPM in two West Midnapore municipalities ? Ramjibanpur and Chandrakona.

 The CPM-run civic bodies in Ghatal subdivision will be going to polls on Sunday. 

 But functionaries of the three parties are keen not to speak about the grand alliance. In public, they say they could not field candidates in all the seats. But in reality, the contest will be straight in all 23 wards of the two municipalities ? united Opposition versus the CPM and Independents backed by the party. 

 Local Trinamul, BJP and Congress leaders are unanimous that their state leaderships did not understand the importance of a grand alliance. But we, who are directly involved with politics at the grassroots level, know that we have to defeat the CPM at any cost. We are fighting against the communists and, if we dont unite now, we will not survive, said a Trinamul leader.

 The pact is apparently foolproof. Trinamul and Congress workers even campaigned for the BJPs Gobinda Mukherjee. 

 At the time of filing of nominations, workers of the three parties sat down together to scrutinise papers submitted to avoid any kind of overlapping. Overseeing the exercise were district Trinamul president Ajit Bhuniya, Ghatal block Congress leader Sujit Panja and the BJP district secretary, Moloy Bhattacharya.

 However, fearing disciplinary action from their leaders, the trio denied the existence of any grand alliance. We have fielded candidates only where we could. In the areas where we could not find a nominee, we have told our supporters to urge the people to vote for anti-Left parties. If any one describes this as a mahajot (grand alliance), we are helpless, said Jagannath Goswami, the block Congress president.

 Bhuniya said: We have not formed any alliance with any party. The fact is that we have fielded candidates according to our ability. And who do you think the people should vote for in wards where we have not put up our candidates? Anti-Left forces, of course.

 Gobinda Mukherjee, the BJPs Ghatal vice-president, said the leaders in Calcutta were unable to gauge the situation. We had no other option but to fight the CPM together.

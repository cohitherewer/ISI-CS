 CII turns to Yechury

 ANURADHA SHARMA LAKHOTIA

 Siliguri, Sept. 10: Members of the North Bengal zonal council of the Confederation of Indian Industry today met CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury and submitted to him a wish list for the Centre.

 The industrialists of north Bengal, who see the Left as the path to central support for the development of industry in the region, discussed various projects with Yechury, before the Rajya Sabha member left for Delhi in the afternoon.

 Yechury had yesterday delivered a lecture at a function organised by the Ratan Lal Brahmin Charitable Trust in Darjeeling. He met the industrialists for 45 minutes today at Circuit House before boarding a flight from Bagdogra.

 A representation has been given to me by the members of the CII asking for help in taking up issues with the central government, Yechury said. The issues relate to the development of Siliguri as a hub of north Bengal.

 The CPM leader refrained from making any commitment, but said the issues would be taken up with the United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre. I have taken note of the points raised by them and we will take up the matter at the Centre.

 The wish list includes renaming Bagdogra airport Siliguri Airport and operating international flights from it, extending to the region facilities enjoyed by states like Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal and those of the northeast and including Siliguri in the National Urban Development Programme.

 Given that north Bengal forms a part of the contiguous area with the northeast, an obvious demand has been raised to extend facilities enjoyed by northeastern states to this region also, said Yechury.

 Another demand, which is quite genuine, relates to the opening of the Nathu-la pass, he said. As the opening of the pass would benefit Bengal as well, they are right in demanding that Bengal should also be included in all discussions taking place regarding the opening of the pass.

 Kamal K. Mittal, chairman of the zonal council expressed hope in Yechurys assurances and the Lefts changing attitude towards industry. In the last few years, the Left has really changed. The state government has been very encouraging in inviting people from other states to invest here, he said.

 We met Yechury as he is an important Left leader at the Centre and a Rajya Sabha member from our state. His initiative would be instrumental in garnering support from the central government.

 Given the pace at which Siliguri is growing in importance, its time that both the governments realised the need for taking up developing infrastructure and starting work as early as possible, Mittal said.

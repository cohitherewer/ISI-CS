 Healthcare ills diagnosed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug 1: People were denied basic minimum health care in rural Bengal, says the latest report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG).

 According to the report, placed in the Assembly today, the objective of taking healthcare to villagers door-steps remained out of reach because of shortage of health centres as well as medical and paramedical staff. 

 The sub-centres, primary health centres and rural hospitals lack instruments, labour rooms, laboratories, electricity, drinking water and toilets, says CAG. Out of 2,570 sub centres in four districts ? West Midnapore, North 24-Parganas, Bankura and Cooch Behar ? 655 are functioning in very small spaces. 

 In none of the four test-checked public health centres, delivery cases were taken up for want of the basic facilities. 

 Despite the governments avowed mission to improve healthcare in Bengal, between 1999 and 2004, only 20 per cent of rural hospitals that should have been set up, 61 per cent of primary health centres and 78 per cent of the sub-centres actually came up. 

 In the four districts, the shortage of rural hospitals ranged between 76 and 95 per cent. The number of primary health centres was short by 32-50 per cent. From 1999-2004, only 10 primary health centres were set up in the state.

 Expressing concern over the shortage of staff, the report says only 31 per cent of doctors were deployed in rural areas to serve 72 per cent of the total population. 

 Against 20,712 health assistants needed for 10,356 sub-centres, 14,155 were available. 

 In the four districts covered by the study, 1,396 out of 5,140 health assistant posts remained vacant in 2,570 sub-centres, resulting in neglect of maternal and child health, family planning and medical termination of pregnancy. 

 According to the report, most rural hospitals and health centres reported low bed-occupancy because of inadequate facilities offered, lack of doctors and non-operational out-patient departments (OPDs). In the rural health centres, patients suffering from even routine ailments like fever, diarrhoea and vomiting were denied treatment in OPDs and were referred to district and subdivisional hospitals. 

 During 2001-2003, only 9per cent of the requirement of anti-rabies vaccine was supplied to the four rural hospitals and three primary health centres of West Midnapore. Over 1,500 dog-bite victims were deprived treatment. 

 The reports says equipment worth Rs 52.67 lakh were lying idle in health centres. 

 Medicines were procured without indents and assessment of requirement, leading to short supply. 

 In the four districts, 50 to 79 per cent of eligible couples did not adopt any family planning measures mainly because of lack of surgeons in health centres and short supply of the intra-uterine device and conventional contraceptives.

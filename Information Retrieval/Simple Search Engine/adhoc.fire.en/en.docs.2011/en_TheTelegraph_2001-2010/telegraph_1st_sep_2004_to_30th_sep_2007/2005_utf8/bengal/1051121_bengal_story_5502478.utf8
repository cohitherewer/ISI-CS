 Denied cricket, boy kills himself 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Nov. 20: A 12-year-old boy hanged himself at a Nadia village last night after being denied permission to see on TV Virender Sehwag leading an assault on South African bowlers in Bangalore. 

 Bishnu Sarkars father wanted him to help bind bidis, but he wont leave the neigh- bours house at Subarnakhali village, 90 km from Calcutta. 

 Bijan Sarkar dragged his son out of Nirmal Kanti Biswass house around 5 pm. After a sound thrashing at home, the Class IV student of Amdanga Primary School was forced to join his father in his job. 

 Bijan had an order to supply last night, a police officer said today. Usually, his wife Purnima assisted him in bidi binding but last evening, she was busy in some other work. 

 Bishnu sat with his father, but his mind was not on the task at hand. After a while, Bijan left for duty at a tea-stall, asking Bishnu to carry on. Screams of delight wafting from the adjoining house with every Sehwag hit did not make things any easier. But he didnt have the courage to ask his mother to allow him to return to the TV, the police officer said. 

 Bishnu got up, asked his five-year-old sister to step out of the room and shut the door. A scream made Purnima rush to the room moments later. When its door was broken open, he was hanging from the ceiling.

 Bijan said: I was very tensed as I had to deliver at least 100 bundles last night, he said. I would have made a bad impression had I failed. I earn Rs 1,000 a month from bidis. The part-time job at the tea-stall hardly fetches money.

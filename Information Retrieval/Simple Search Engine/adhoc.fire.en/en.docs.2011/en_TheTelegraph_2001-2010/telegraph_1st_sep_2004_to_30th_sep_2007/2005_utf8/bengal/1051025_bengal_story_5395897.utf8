 Fight for hearth far away 

 - Much is lost but Kashmiri shawlwallahs stick it out

 Burdwan, Oct. 24: Mohammad Iqbals single-storey wood-brick house has been razed to the ground. His father Abul Suban is fighting for life in hospital and uncle Farooq is nursing a bruised chest and a broken leg. His cousin Jamina and her father Ibrahim were buried alive. Seven remaining members of his family, his mother and sister among them, are now in tents, battling a fierce cold. 

 But Iqbal is still selling shawls in faraway Burdwan.

 The quake on October 8 has taken a heavy toll on the 26-year-old resident of Baramulla. He has a loan to repay and many mouths to feed. I cant go back, even if I want to. Seven members of my family depend on me. Besides, Ive borrowed Rs 3 lakh from a moneylender on high interest to buy the shawls and woollens. He wont spare me if I dont repay him, said Iqbal. 

 We cant go, said Manjur Ahmed, a resident of Srinagar. The quake did not spare his family either. My father Sheikh Masood, sister Sirina Sultana? are all living in a relief camp. If I go to them now, they might be happy, but what will I feed them? My fathers flower garden has been ravaged, he said.

 Like Iqbal and Ahmed, 18 other Kashmiris who have come here, about 115 km from Calcutta, with their winter wear are mourning the deaths of their relatives or friends, but refusing to return home.

 Every year, about 5,000 Kashmiris come to Bengal around October to sell shawls, sweaters and other woollens and return in April. The business means a profit of about Rs 20,000-25,000, the lifeline for their families. 

 This year, 35 shawlwallahs ? aged between 25 and 35 ? arrived in Burdwan in early October. After calamity struck, 15 of them went back. 

 Those who stayed behind have rented a room in Pakmara Lane. Everyday, after the days business is done, the youths queue up before telephone booths.

 Some of them weep while talking to their relatives. Its a pity I cant understand their language fully, said Sagar Dev Burman, the owner of a public call office in the town. 

 Some cant even talk to their family members. The telephone lines in my village are dead. Im getting no information from my home, said Manjur Ahmed.

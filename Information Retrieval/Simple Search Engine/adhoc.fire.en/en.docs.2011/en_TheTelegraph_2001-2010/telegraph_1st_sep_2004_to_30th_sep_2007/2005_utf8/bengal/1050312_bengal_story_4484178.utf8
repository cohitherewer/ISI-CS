 Students made to bear school rent 

 Behrampore, March 11: The Murshidabad authorities have taken strong exception to a school?s charging students for classrooms taken on rent at a nearby house. 

 Qutubpur Naba Adarsha High School in Murshidabad town, 220 km from Calcutta, was a junior high institution till 1999. The four- room school, teaching classes V to VIII, operated from its own building then. In 2000, it was made a high school to include IX and X. In the absence of space, two rooms were rented at Rs 7,200 a year. The school managing committee asked the 640 students to pay Rs 10 annually. 

 The issue came to district inspector of schools (secondary) Subhendu Ghosh?s notice after guardians, who called the fee illegal, protested against it on Tuesday. The school, they also alleged, never gave receipts in the past five years. 

 Ghosh said the school had no business charging the students. ?We?ll soon make arrangements to ensure the payment of the rent by the government,? he added.

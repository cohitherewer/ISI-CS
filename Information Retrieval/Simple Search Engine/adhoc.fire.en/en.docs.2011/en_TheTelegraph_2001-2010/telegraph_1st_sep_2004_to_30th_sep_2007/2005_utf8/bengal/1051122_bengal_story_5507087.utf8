 Mamata and MLAs on list of wanted

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 21: The Trinamul Congress leadership went into a huddle today after it came to know that chief Mamata Banerjee and several MLAs figured among the 72,000 wanted people in Bengal.

 The party today procured a compact disc containing the 72,000 names. 

 We have not been able to scan all the 72,000 names but have come to know that my name is also on the list in connection with a law violation programme in the North 24-Parganas district magistrates office on February 22, 1994. I want to make it clear that the list was prepared by police, which initiated suo motu cases against us at the behest of the ruling CPM, said Mamata.

 Sonali (Guha) also appears on the list?. No specific charge against her has been mentioned.

 Party sources said MLAs Pankaj Banerjee, Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay and Sougata Roy also appear on the list prepared following instructions from the Election Commission.

 The commission has asked all 72,000 people to appear before local electoral registration officers within seven days of getting its notice. Else, their names would be struck off the voters list.

 On February 22, 1994, Mamata and other senior Trinamul leaders had organised the law violation at Barasat. One Gobinda Banerjee was killed in police firing during the agitation. The police initiated a case against Mamata. 

 Whatever the reason, I am not surrendering. Whatever I have done, I have done for the people and I think I have not committed any crime. The CPM does not want the Opposition leaders to contest the Assembly polls, she said.

 State CPM secretary Anil Biswas said: There is nothing political in it. Everything was done on the basis of the commissions instructions. Many of our leaders, even minister Narayan Biswas (who has surrendered and is now in jail), appeared on the list.

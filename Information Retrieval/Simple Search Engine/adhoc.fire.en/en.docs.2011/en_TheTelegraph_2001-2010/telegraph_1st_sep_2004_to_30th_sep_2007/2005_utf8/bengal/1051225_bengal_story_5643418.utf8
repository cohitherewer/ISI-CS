 Hat-trick of new routes in new year

 - Christmas comes with cheer for the commuter in the city

 KINSUK BASU

 Santa is visiting Calcutta with a string of new roads. 

 He had to, after all, ensure smoother passage for his sledge in the city with the highest vehicle density in India. 

 First, there would be a flyover. And, almost simultaneously, work would begin on the citys first elevated road. To cap it all, there will be an extra-wide EM Bypass. 

 At a recent meeting, the state government decided to build the elevated road from the Calcutta end of Howrah bridge to Girish Park to avoid the traffic chaos that prevails at Posta and on Strand Road and adjoining areas. 

 Initially conceived as a transport department project, the CMDA was roped in to deliver the goods at the behest of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 According to the proposal, the 1.7-km stretch would be built on pillars without affecting the traffic below and would offer a nonstop ride for those planning to hit Central Avenue or College Street from Howrah.

 The Rs 220-crore project would get 35 per cent of the funds from the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, which was launched recently by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 

 This mission aims to provide Rs 50,000 crore to states for urban infrastructure development programmes. 

 The state would provide 15 per cent and the rest will come through public-private partnerships or loans from financial institutions.

 Work on the first phase is expected to begin in March. The second, which would connect Girish Park to VIP Road, would be taken up later. 

 The state government has agreed to build this elevated road and there will be no backtracking. We have sought a detailed project report from Consulting Engineering Services, said a senior officer of the CMDAs traffic and transportation wing. 

 The four-lane road would be around 14.4 metres wide and will stand on pre-fabricated steel-pillars, like those that now hold the AJC Bose Road flyover. 

 The basic work ? survey of the landscape, electric lines and other allied jobs ? has already started. This is a pre-requisite for understanding the economic feasibility of the project. All these would go into the detailed project report that we will submit to the state government, said Samiran Sen, the executive director of Consulting Engineering Services. 

 Besides obvious details, the report would discuss how the elevated road would effectively cut down road time for all vehicles that now get caught in traffic snarls either on Mahatma Gandhi Road leading to Howrah or on Strand Road, leading to Ganesh Talkies in the north. 

 The CMDA is keen to also start work on the proposed Ultadanga flyover connecting a stretch of the EM Bypass to VIP Road. The government has cleared this project.

 This flyover, which will start near Swabhumi on the EM Bypass and connect with VIP Road near Ultadanga, is first on the priority list and would also be supported by the National Urban Renewal Mission fund. 

 In the next few years, this flyover will play a very important role in tackling the pressure of airport-bound traffic, a CMDA officer said. 

 According to proposal, the Rs 52-crore project would only cover 1.5 km but cut down the time to reach Dum Dum airport substantially because the flyover would allow drivers to avoid the congested Ultadanga intersection. The crossing itself would be rid of much of its burden.

 Even as the decks are being cleared for the construction of this flyover, the CMDA has decided not to waste time. 

 The development authority has invited tenders from those interested in a project to widen the Bypass. From a six-lane road, the Bypass would turn an eight-lane one when the project is completed. 

 Initially, a 6-km stretch ? from Ultadanga to Parama Island ? would be widened. 

 Work is scheduled to begin around mid-January.

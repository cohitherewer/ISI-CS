 Growth pangs for twin ports

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 6: Port infrastructure in Bengal must be upgraded to keep pace with the surge in sea-borne traffic on account of increasing foreign and coastal trade.

 A recent survey by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) makes it clear that as the two main ports in the state ? in Calcutta and Haldia ? are already stretched, additional capacity has to be created and the existing problems solved to ensure free and timely flow of goods.

 We conducted the study to identify the constraints ports in Bengal are facing. The objective was to help the state government in formulating policies that can further improve the condition of ports in the state, said a CII spokesperson.

 From evaluating the performance of the ports to highlighting the problem areas and suggesting policy measures to tracking the work in progress in terms of privatisation measures, the study presents a comprehensive picture of the states port infrastructure.

 The report highlights some of the problems facing Calcutta Port Trust (including the Calcutta Dock System and the Haldia Dock Complex) ? accommodating deep-draft vessels, dated equipment for cargo handling, congestion, silting of the Hooghly and labour trouble.

 But the report presents a host of figures to prove that the twin ports have fared well despite the bottlenecks. According to the survey, Calcutta Port Trust registered the highest absolute growth in traffic and container traffic among major Indian ports. A lot of positive things are happening in the port-related infrastructure in Bengal, said a CII spokesperson.

 The report says: During April-June 2004, container traffic in terms of volume increased by 23.3 per cent (in terms of tonnes) at Calcutta Port Trust ? including Calcutta Dock System and Haldia Dock Complex ? in comparison to the corresponding period in the last year.

 While timer log registered a modest increase, traffic of major commodities like iron and steel, pulses, vegetable oil and petroleum and oil products declined in the Calcutta Dock System. 

 At Haldia dock, while traffic of petroleum and oil (crude), LPG and other liquid cargo increased during the period, the volume of major commodities like petroleum and oil (products), thermal coal, iron ore and iron and steel handled declined.

 Although the survey does not explain the specific reasons behind the dip in volume of some major commodities handled, the message to expedite improvement measures ? from releasing resources to carrying out dredging to improving efficiency and quality of services through private participation ? is loud and clear. 

 The final aim is to reduce turnaround time and improve export competitiveness of these ports, the CII spokesperson said.

 Another CPM catch in graft net 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Aug. 23: Three days after the arrest of a CPM panchayat leader for allegedly siphoning central development funds in West Midnapore, another leader who was recently suspended from the party got caught for a similar offence in the same district.

 Sudhangsu Pramanick, the former chief of Angua village panchayat and party local committee member, was yesterday picked up from his house at Jamuapati, 160 km from Calcutta. Dantan-I block development officer Sudipta Bhattacharya had filed a police complaint against him.

 While looking into the expenditure of the Angua panchayat between 1999 and 2002, Bhattacharya found that over Rs 1 lakh had been misappropriated. 

 The party has recently been rocked by allegations of corruption in the district. Last Friday, the chief of the Gopiballavpur rural body, Santilal Upadhyay, was arrested also following an FIR lodged by the local BDO. A little over a week ago, it suspended Ananta Maur, Nilmoni Chakraborty and Jhareswar Dolui in Ghatal after charges of embezzling about Rs 1.6 lakh meant for the Centres food-for-work scheme were levelled against them. 

 Maur is a zilla parishad member, Chakraborty a panchayat samiti member and Dolui a gram panchayat member.

 Bhattacharya said: We have detected cases where huge amounts were shown as spent on various schemes, but the persons or organisations on whose names vouchers were issued never received them.

 The administration has done the right thing by arresting our members at Ghatal and Gopiballavpur. It should find all those involved... we are earning a bad name because of some people, said Harekrishna Jana, a district secretariat member.

 Order sparks Left unity

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 31: The CPM today was shell-shocked at the order against Left Front chairman Biman Bose.

 Many party leaders like industry minister Nirupam Sen and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya were unaware of the development when they arrived at the party headquarters on Alimuddin Street this afternoon. 

 Sen, known to be close to Bose, learnt of the order from newspersons. ?Is it?really? I did not know about it,? said a visibly surprised Sen and ran up to the first floor to meet Bose who was already holding a meeting with state party chief Anil Biswas. Sen joined the meeting.

 Bhattacharya, who had come to brief party leaders on the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council, changed plans and waited for Bose, Biswas and Sen to emerge from their meeting.

 Left Front partners, who earlier had reservations about Bose?s stand on Justice Amitava Lala?s order restricting rallies in the city on working days, rallied behind Bose.

 ?We can always move the Supreme Court challenging the high court order,? said the state Forward Bloc secretary, Ashok Ghosh.

 State RSP secretary Debabrata Bandopadhyay also felt that the order could be challenged in a higher court. ?Anyone can move the Supreme Court against a high court order. We support Biman Bose?s move to challenge the order in the Supreme Court,? he said.

 However, the Trinamul Congress welcomed the judgment. ?Anyone can move the Supreme Court against a judgment. But the CPM has made it a regular practice to interfere in the affairs of the judiciary and the executive,? said Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee.

 State Congress general secretary Manas Bhuniya said that it would not be proper to comment on a high court order. ?But nobody is above law,? he said.

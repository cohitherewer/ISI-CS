 BRIEFS

 Midnapore, Dec. 11: Mamata Banerjee has urged the smaller partners in the Left Front to join the Paschim Banga Ganatantrik Front, the anti-CPM platform she has formed.

 For how long will you tolerate the big brotherly attitude of the CPM? Join our platform to fight the CPMs misrule, the Trinamul chief said at a public meeting in Jhargram in West Midnapore, 170 km from Calcutta.

 Behrampore: Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury, who went on a hunger strike on Saturday, withdrew the agitation after additional inspector-general of prisons Ramapada Bhattacharya assured that his grievances would be looked into. Chowdhury went on hunger strike against alleged ill-treatment by the Behrampore central jail authorities.

 Calcutta: Eight-year old Suvra Chakraborty went missing from her Umesh Dutta Lane residence in the Bartala police station area on Sunday afternoon. Suvras father Tapas Chakraborty owns a jewellery shop. Police suspect that a former employee of the shop, who also went missing, might be involved in the abduction.

 Kalyani: Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee has criticised vulgarity in films, television shows and the media. I am neither a cultural police nor am I rigid and orthodox. But what is being shown is intolerable, he said in Kalyani, 45 km from Calcutta.

 Calcutta: Ismail Nehal and D.K. Bhattacharya were re-elected president and secretary of the Association of Teachers in Anglo-Indian Schools at its election on Sunday.

 BRIEFS

 Durgapur, Jan. 3: Police last night sealed 42 abandoned coal pits at Baraboni in Burdwan, 260 km from Calcutta. 

 The action was part of a crackdown on coal smugglers in the Rasulpur forest area. Additional superintendent of police Satyajit Banerjee said gangsters from neighbouring Jharkhand, too, frequent the area. Over the past five months, 256 smugglers have been arrested and 1,900 tonnes of coal recovered. Days ago, Eastern Coalfields, CISF and the district authorities decided on a joint crackdown against the mafia. 

 Calcutta: Acting on a tip-off by the detective department, Delhi police recovered on Monday Rs 9 lakh in counterfeit currency notes from the capital. A Delhi police officer said the notes, in denominations of Rs 1,000, were brought through the Bangladesh-Calcutta route last week.

 Chandernagore: Miscreants called out Samar Mukherjee, 53, a businessman, from his house here on Monday and shot him dead. No one has been arrested.

 Purulia: Retired railway employee Rambilas Paswan was looted of Rs 2 lakh, which was part of his superannuation benefits, on his way from the bank. The miscreants in Adra town, 235 km from Calcutta, tied a string to the rear wheel of his cycle and got it jammed. When he tried to see what happened, they snatched his bag.

 Buddha SOS to Delhi

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ghisingh: Not budging

 Calcutta, Feb. 12: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today sought Union home minister Shivraj Patil?s intervention to persuade Subhas Ghisingh to hold the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council elections by the stipulated date. 

 The council?s term expires on March 25, by which it will have to be re-constituted.

 Bhattacharjee spoke to Patil on the phone this morning and stressed the need for finalising the election date. 

 The Centre has convened a tripartite meeting on Thursday, as demanded by the Gorkha National Liberation Front leader.

 ?I have told him that Ghisingh is blocking the way to elections by raising some unrealistic demands. I am going to Delhi to attend the tripartite meeting and will try to convince the GNLF leader,?? Bhattacharjee told a CPM rally at the Brigade Parade Ground. 

 The chief minister will meet leaders from the CPM?s Darjeeling unit in Siliguri on Monday to brief them about the latest developments before heading to Delhi. 

 Bhattacharjee is also expected to meet the district administration.

 Bhattacharjee said he had tried to tell Ghisingh that it would not be fair to link the election date with his demands. ?When he came to Calcutta to meet me, I told the GNLF leader to hold elections in time and promised to look into his demands. But he did not change his stand. He is refusing to participate in the elections as a mark of protest against ISI activities in the hill areas. I do not know what is the connection between ISI activities and the hill council polls. I told him the ISI will be happy if the elections are not held. The ISI is very active in Jammu and Kashmir, but has it been cited to stop elections there??

 The GNLF leader wants, among other things, more central funds, power to recruit teachers and control over police deployment in the hills.

 ?We will make a last-ditch attempt to persuade Ghisingh at the tripartite meeting in Delhi. Let us see what transpires at the meeting,? Bhattacharjee said.

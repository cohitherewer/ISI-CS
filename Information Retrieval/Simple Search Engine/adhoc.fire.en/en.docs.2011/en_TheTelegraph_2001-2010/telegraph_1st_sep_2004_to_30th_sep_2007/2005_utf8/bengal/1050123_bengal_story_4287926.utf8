 Boys break out of shelter

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Jan. 22: The state-run Kishalaya home for destitute children in Barasat is reeling under a crisis again.

 A little more than two months after six minor boys had fled from the home after allegedly being ?tortured?, four inmates gave security guards the slip yesterday.

 This is the third escape from the home in six months.

 Sheikh Alamgir (18) and Sheikh Alamin (17) reportedly went out after telling the guards that they would return soon. ?If this is true, then the security personnel must be pulled up. But before that, an investigation must be carried out,? a home official said.

 In the evening, Suman Sheikh (14) and Saiful Islam (11) tied a mosquito net to a tree that helped them climb out of the high boundary wall. This mode of escape had been used earlier as well. ?This is an easy escape route. And though it has happened so many times in the past, the government has done nothing about it and neither has the condition of the home improved on that account,? a source said.

 A complaint has been lodged at Barasat police station, but none of the boys has been traced.

 The source alleged that the boys are given poor quality food and feel claustrophobic in a regimented environment. 

 The home has been plagued by several problems, including severe water crisis and the impending closure of a training-cum-production centre for handicrafts due to shortage of staff.

 Over the last two years, 17 inmates have run away from the home and only seven of them came back. Officials said there have been two inquiries in the last year.

 ?We had verified that those who fled from this home have a past record of fleeing from their own homes. Thus, it is quite impossible for us to keep them confined as they have a natural tendency to escape. The torture stories are often fabricated by them to justify their act,? said H. Saha, child welfare officer of North 24-Parganas, who oversees the home.

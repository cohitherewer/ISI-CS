 Killer ?cool? clue to murder

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Feb. 26: The murder of Arvind Bhai was pre-planned and not an act in the heat of the moment, the CID claimed today while putting together pieces based on the confessions of a witness.

 Mukesh Singh, who was witness to the killing and drove the red Omni used to dump the body, has said during questioning there was no heated talk between Arvind, Pappu and Gunjan Ghosh over the ransom they got from Roma Jhawar?s family before he was shot early on February 5.

 The police today fished out Arvind?s shoes, belt and a diary from Subhas Sarovar, where they had been dumped after the killing.

 Though the police believe Gunjan pulled the trigger on Arvind, Mukesh has told them that Pappu, who is still absconding, fired the shot. Mukesh has also said that Gunjan and Pappu were ?cool? about it, suggesting that they had planned to kill him all along. 

 Rajeev Kumar, the deputy inspector-general of CID (operations), said: ?It now appears that the entire act of doing away with Arvind was planned to perfection and not something done in a hurry over sharing of booty. Evidently, the abductors knew exactly what they were doing and why. When throwing away a briefcase containing some of Arvind?s items, the gang tied stones to it ensure that it did not surface.? 

 Gunjan has been claiming that Arvind was the mastermind of Roma?s abduction and that Pappu shot him when the two picked up a quarrel over the ransom. 

 The sleuths are not taking Mukesh?s words at face value but his statements, they said, were a pointer to criminal traits in Gunjan. 

 Soon after the interrogation was over this afternoon, the sleuths went to the Sarovar in Beleghata and asked Mukesh to identify the spot where Arvind?s belongings were thrown. Around 12.15 pm, two divers from Calcutta police?s disaster management group were pressed into operation. Arvind?s dairy has several phone numbers, including Gunjan?s. 

 The police said after dumping the body at a canal off EM Bypass, Gunjan, Pappu and Mukesh drove back to Kadapara in Phoolbagan, burnt Arvind?s clothes and threw his other belongings into the water body. His shoes were packed into the briefcase used by the Jhawars to hand the ransom.

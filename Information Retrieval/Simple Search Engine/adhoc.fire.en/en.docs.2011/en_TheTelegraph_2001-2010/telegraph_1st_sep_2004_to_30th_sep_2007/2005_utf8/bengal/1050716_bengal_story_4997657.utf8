 Tea strike solution so near, yet... 

 OUR BUREAU

 July 15: The government today claimed that the tea impasse was nearing an end and both garden employers and Writers Buildings expressed hope of a breakthrough tomorrow.

 Todays discussions were fruitful and positive. A solution is in sight and is likely to emerge tomorrow, commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said after a tripartite meeting this evening.

 However, the workers unions appeared sceptical about the solution. The employers today offered a raise of Re 1 in the daily minimum wages and wanted a five-year agreement on this. But we didnt accept their proposal and have demanded a minimum daily wage of Rs 88, said Manohar Tirkey, a former RSP minister and general secretary of the Dooars Tea Garden Workers Union. 

 The workers now get a daily minimum wage of Rs 45.90.

 The five-day-old strike by 3.5 lakh labourers has crippled work in the 350-odd tea gardens in the state. We are hopeful that it will be sorted out tomorrow, said K. David, vice-chairman of the Indian Tea Planters Association.

 Garden owners have also been insisting that wage hikes should be linked with productivity ? a demand the unions have said is unacceptable. We dont think the employers will come up with a wage revision offer acceptable to us. We are not happy with todays meeting, said Samir Ray, convener, Defence Committee for Plantation Workers Rights. 

 In Delhi, CPIs Gurudas Dasgupta said: We have written to agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, commerce minister Kamal Nath.... But the Centre does not seem to be bothered.

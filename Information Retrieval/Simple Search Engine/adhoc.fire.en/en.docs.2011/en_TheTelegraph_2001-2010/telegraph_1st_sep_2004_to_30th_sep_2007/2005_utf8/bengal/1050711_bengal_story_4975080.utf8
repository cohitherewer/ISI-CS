 Boy death viscera test

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bolpur, July 10: A viscera test will be conducted on Biplab Ghosh, a Class X student who was found dead under mysterious circumstances on Saturday, to ascertain the cause of his death.

 Police officials have not been able to confirm if the 16-year-old student of Shiksha Satra, a co-educational high school under Visva-Bharati, committed suicide and are banking on the viscera test report to get a clear picture.

 In cases, where the reason of death is unclear, we need this test. After the viscera test, we will be able to know what exactly caused the death, said Birbhum superintendent of police Akhil Roy.

 The stomach, liver and kidney are being sent to the forensic lab in Calcutta for tests.

 The post-mortem report will be submitted to the police on Monday.

 Cong open to Mamata talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 7: Defence minister and state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee today said he was open to talks with Mamata Banerjee on electoral adjustments in the run-up to next years Assembly polls.

 I have no problem if Mamata is willing to discuss the matter. We, too, are serious about averting a split in the anti-CPM vote bank in Bengal, Mukherjee said on phone from Delhi.

 At a rally on Monday, the Trinamul chief had said electoral adjustments could be worked out between the two parties despite being a part of the NDA. She had called upon the Congress to join forces with her without any pre-conditions to oust the CPM from power.

 Asked if her association with the NDA will stand in the way, Mukherjee said: Mamata must be aware of our national compulsion. However, I can talk to her if she desires.

 Information and broadcasting minister and senior state Congress leader Priya Ranjan Das Munshi had yesterday said in Delhi that he would see to it that Mukherjee and Mamata discuss the Trinamul chiefs suggestion for a possible seat adjustment for the coming Assembly polls.

 (The) time has come to unite the anti-CPM forces as people of Bengal want a change in governance. So the state Congress, despite my alliance with the NDA, could join me to ensure the CPMs defeat. If I am not objecting to the Congresss alliance at the Centre, then the Congress should not bother about my association with the NDA, she told party leaders this afternoon.

 We have made our stand clear and the ball is now in the Congresss court, she told The Telegraph.

 Senior state Congress leaders, including former PCC chief Somen Mitra, once anathema to the Trinamul leader, were also in favour of an electoral tie-up with Mamata. What Mamata said is quite justified. We can ensure the CPMs defeat only if we are able to put up single candidates against Left Front nominees. This can help us avert a split in the anti-CPM vote bank, Mitra said.

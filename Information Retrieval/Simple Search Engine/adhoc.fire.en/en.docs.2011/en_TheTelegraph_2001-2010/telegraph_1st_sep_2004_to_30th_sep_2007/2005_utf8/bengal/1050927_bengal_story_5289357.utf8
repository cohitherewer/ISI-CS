 Killer slur on statehood spearheads

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Cooch Behar, Sept. 26: Bangshibadan Barman, the secretary of the Greater Cooch Behar Peoples Association and Jyo- tish Chandra Sarkar, its president, were today accused of murder. 

 The security guard of Kalimpong additional superintendent of police Mushtaq Ahmed, who was lynched on September 20 by the group demanding a new Greater Cooch Behar state, has filed an FIR with the Siliguri police station.

 Ahmed and constables Gour Chandra Dhar and Jogesh Chandra Sarkar were attacked by the mob at Chakchaka, 6 km from here. The two constables and two protesters were among five killed that day.

 Constable Gorey Tamang, who also beaten up and is now at a nursing home in Siliguri, named Barman and Sarkar in the FIR.

 Cooch Behar superintendent of police Jagmohan confirmed that the duo has been accused of murder. We have arrested 40 people in connection with the murders and for assaulting policemen and disturbing peace, he said. More arrests are likely.

 Confronted with the possibility of arrest, Barman tried to pluck up courage and said he would let the law run its course.

 The police had blocked all roads leading to the Cooch Behar town to prevent thousands of people from marching to the district magistrates office to sit on a hunger strike dem- anding the new state.

 I and Jyotish never went to the Chakchaka gathering. I was at Bhetaguri, Dewanhat and Ghughumari during our movement, which was peaceful, Barman said. 

 He added that members of his association were peace-loving. I still insist that a probe be initiated to get to the truth on who exactly killed the policemen so brutally.

 Barman claimed that at all the spots he visited, he met senior police officers and spoke to them. Let one officer state on oath that he had seen me at Chakchaka.

 Since the hunger strike and blockade was lifted from Bhetaguri on Friday, Barman and the associations cultural secretary, Asutosh Barman, have been staying together. 

 We are afraid that we will be attacked by Left Front supporters. They are collecting names of our members, Asutosh said. 

 He also alleged that Forward Bloc and CPM supporters were threatening supporters of the association. 

 Dark days wait in store for us, but we will face them with peace as we are not afraid to give our lives for our cause, Barman said.

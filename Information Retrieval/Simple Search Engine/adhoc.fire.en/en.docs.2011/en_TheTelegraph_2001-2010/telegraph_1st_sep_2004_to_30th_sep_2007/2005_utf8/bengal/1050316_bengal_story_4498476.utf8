 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, March 15: The state government today appointed Shyamalesh Dutta, the ex-chief valuer of the Howrah Improvement Trust, to assess the market price of Justice Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee?s home.

 The former judge of Calcutta High Court, however, refused to ?entertain? anyone other than a high court-panelled valuer.

 On November 19, 2004, the Supreme Court had dismissed the allotment of 3.5 cottahs in Salt Lake?s FD block, which Banerjee had obtained from the chief minister?s quota. 

 Calcutta: After spending 15 years behind bars, a man, charged with murdering his wife, has been acquitted by Calcutta High Court. Sashti Mahanto, a resident of Balurghat, had been awarded life term.

 Calcutta: Defying a Supreme Court ruling, nearly 26,000 lawyers will cease work on Friday in protest against the government?s move to place the Block-Level Pre-litigation Conciliation Board Bill before the Assembly during the ongoing budget session. 

 Howrah: CPM leader from Domjur Susanta Pal and a social worker died when their motorcycle collided with another bike on the Howrah-Amta Road.

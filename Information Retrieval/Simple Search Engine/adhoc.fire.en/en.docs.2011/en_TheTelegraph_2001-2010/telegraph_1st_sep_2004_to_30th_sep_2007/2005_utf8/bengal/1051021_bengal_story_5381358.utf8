 Arjun birth in Bengal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 20: Bengal is all set to draw investment, foreign and domestic, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said today with Benny Santoso by his side.

 There will be industrialisation in Bengal and investments will come, the chief minister announced as he ruled out projecting todays success as a poll gimmick. 

 Santoso went to Writers at 2.25 pm. The first of his two meetings there was with commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen. Bhattacharjee joined them after 4 pm and the meeting went on for another hour. 

 Tomorrow, the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) would formally hand over land at Uluberia to Santosos company. 

 Mahabharat Motorcycle Manufacturing Company Pvt Ltd will produce motorcycles under the brand name Arjun, the chief minister announced. 

 Ramayan and Mahabharat are epics for them, too.... I had seen a statue of Arjun and Krishna in a chariot in Indonesia, he added.

 We had requested the Salim Group to open a motorcycle-manufacturing unit here and things had been almost finalised before I went to Indonesia. However, the detailed project report had not been completed.... Today, things have taken a final shape. The land would be transferred to them officially tomorrow, Bhattacharjee said.

 Engineering officials from Santosos company have been in town for the past three days. There will be soil tests in November and work will commence in January. It will be completed in 18 months, the chief minister said. 

 Initially, 5,000 motorcycles would be produced a month. In the next stage, 200,000 two-wheelers would be manufactured in the Rs 250-crore project. Bhattacharjee said initially, 1,000 people would be employed. It would go up to 3,000. 

 Talks on the health city, industrial zone, road and logistics hub, Bhattacharjee said, are in the pipeline.

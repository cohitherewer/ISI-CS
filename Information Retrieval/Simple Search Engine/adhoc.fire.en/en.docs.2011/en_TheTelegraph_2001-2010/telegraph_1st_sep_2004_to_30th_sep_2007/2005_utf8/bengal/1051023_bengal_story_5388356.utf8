 Cong hint to Mamata on poll pact

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 22: The Congress today renewed its call to Mamata Banerjee to snap ties with the BJP and make poll adjustments with the party.

 We want Mamata to tie up with the Congress as she did in the 2001 polls. But we cannot to do it unless she severs relations with the communal BJP, defence minister and PCC president Pranab Mukherjee said in a meeting at the party headquarters this afternoon.

 The Congress cannot have ties with any party which is part of the NDA, he later told reporters.

 Todays meeting of the apex decision-making body of the state Congress discussed the strategy vis-?-vis the forthcoming Assembly elections.

 Those present pointed out that this was an ideal time to invite Mamata for seat adjustments as she has already floated an outfit of 11 parties under the banner of the Paschimbanga Ganatantrik Front. Moreover, Thursdays protest against the visit of Salim Groups Benny Santoso having flopped, she might have second thoughts on poll adjustments, said a PCC functionary.

 We have no problems on adjustments with the new front if the BJP is kept out. A formidable Opposition is necessary to take on the Marxists, said PCC working president Pradip Bhattacharya.

 In the last Assembly polls, Mamata had offered 57 seats to the Congress, he added. We are leaving it to her to decide the number she wants. But she should realise that an alliance is a must as a fractured Opposition will only help the CPM regain control of the state.

 Mamata, however, said: The front will hold its first meeting on Tuesday. Our doors are open for the Congress. But I cant keep the BJP out as it is necessary to stop a split in anti-CPM votes.

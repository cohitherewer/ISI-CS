 School assessment

 Calcutta, April 14: In its first ever attempt to identify the strengths and weaknesses of primary education in the state, the government will hold an assessment test next week for Class IV students in state-aided institutions.

 Sulapani Bhattacharya, president, West Bengal Board of Primary Education, said the tests, beginning April 19, will continue for three days. The students will be assessed in first-language, English, mathematics, environmental science, history and geography. 

 In keeping with the policy to promote every child till Class V, the assessment for Class IV students will, however, not have any link with an entry to the next class. Nearly 18 lakh students who will appear for the test will be promoted to Class V even if they perform poorly. Promotional examinations are not held in the 57,000 state-aided primary schools in Bengal. 

 In 1999, the government introduced a system of holding an examination for students at the end of Class II ? without, however, detaining anybody ? to get an idea of how the students were progressing. ?With the new test, too, we want to see whether our system is suitable for them,? Bhattacharya said.

 Promise of village power in two years

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 4: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said rural electrification in Bengal will be complete in two years.

 At the launch of Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutikaran Yojna ? a central scheme for rural electricity infrastructure and household electrification ? Bhattacharjee said: ?I express my gratitude towards the Centre for this scheme, which provides the states 90 per cent capital subsidy. We have set March 2007 as the deadline for electrifying all our villages.? 

 Chief ministers of 12 states, the governor of Bihar and the lieutenant governor of Lakshadweep participated in a teleconference today following the formal launch of the yojna by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in New Delhi. 

 According to the Centre?s statistics, Bengal is behind 19 states with 83.63 per cent of its villages having access to power. All villages in Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Nagaland, Punjab and Tamil Nadu have already been electrified. 

 Village electrification would mean reaching power to a certain point in the village, for example the community centre or the panchayat office. But when it comes to providing power to village households, Bengal is way behind others ? at 31st with electricity in only 20.27 per cent of them. 

 Admitting that rural electrification in Bengal was in a sorry state, power minister Mrinal Banerjee, who was with Bhattacharjee during the teleconference, said: ?We are lagging far behind other states. However, in the past few years, we have taken initiatives to bridge the gap.?

 Banerjee also said: ?Because we had to lay special emphasis on power generation, distribution took a beating.? 

 The Centre has said in a document that only 44 per cent of households across India have been electrified with 100,000 villages and 7.8 crore rural households still plunging into darkness after sundown.

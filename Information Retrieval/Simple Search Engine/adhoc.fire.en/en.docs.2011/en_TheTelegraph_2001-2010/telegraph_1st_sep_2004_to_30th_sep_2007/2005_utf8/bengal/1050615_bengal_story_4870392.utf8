 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, June 14: Truant MLAs might have to forego their daily allowance if Bengal implements a directive issued at the All India Whips Conference. 

 At the Hyderabad meet, attended by party chief whips from different states, it was decided that MLAs should get the allowance only for days when they attend the House, parliamentary affairs minister Pra-bodh Sinha said. But to adopt such a resolution, the Speaker would have to consider the views of all parties. 

 Behrampore: Laltu Raj, 42, who had gone to his in-laws place for jamaisashthi, and his wife Sandhya, 37, died of snakebite on Monday. At a village in Kandi, 235 km from Calcutta, they were sleeping in a courtyard to beat the heat when the snake bit them.

 Calcutta: Two youths on a motorcycle hurled a bomb near a Congress office at Narkeldanga on Tuesday night. Police said the vehicle sped away and no one was arrested.

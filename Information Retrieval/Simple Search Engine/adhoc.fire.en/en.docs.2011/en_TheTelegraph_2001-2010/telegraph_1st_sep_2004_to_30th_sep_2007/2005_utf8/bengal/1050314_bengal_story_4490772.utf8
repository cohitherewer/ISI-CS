 BRIEFS

 Behrampore, March 13: Sushil Pal, the vice-chairman of the municipality here, was beaten up this morning in the heart of the town. 

 Hearing Pal?s cry for help, residents rushed in and nabbed one of the miscreants. Sanu Sheikh, who was handed to police, said he had been hired by someone from Pal?s own party, the Congress. The attack on a known member of the Adhir Chowdhury camp is being seen as an instance of faction feud. Municipality chairman Nilratan Adhya said the services rendered by the civic body have been ?closed in protest against the incident?. 

 Krishnagar: Phulan Sardar, 13, married to a betel leaf farmer three months ago, allegedly committed suicide unable to bear poverty. They had no food for four days.

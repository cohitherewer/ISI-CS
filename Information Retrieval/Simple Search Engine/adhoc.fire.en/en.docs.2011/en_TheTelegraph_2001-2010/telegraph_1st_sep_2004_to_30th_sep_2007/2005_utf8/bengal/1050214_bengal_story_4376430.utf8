 Forlorn amp; craving for a V-Day card 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Feb. 13: For Minati Biswas, now lodged at Behrampore Mental Hospital, there was only one craving on the eve of Valentine?s Day: a greeting card from her estranged husband. 

 Minati, a schoolteacher?s daughter, was admitted to the asylum three years ago after a mental breakdown. Despite being declared ?mentally fit? by the authorities, her father has not responded to several letters requesting him to take her home.

 She had an affair with Abdur Rahman, a tea-stall owner, since 1998. After her father fixed her marriage with another youth, Minati, then 19, left her home at Bill Colony in the Nabagram area of Murshidabad, about 225 km from Calcutta, for Abdur?s house in the town. They registered marriage at Jangipur court.

 February 14 always meant special for the two. They used to exchange Valentine?s Day cards to express their love. 

 On the Valentine?s Day of 2001, they exchanged cards for the last time. 

 That October, Minati went to her father?s house and never returned. Instead, Abdur received a divorce notice. 

 ?Believe me, my father forced me to sign on some papers. I never wanted to divorce my husband. How can I? I left home for him...? said Minati.

 On receiving the court notice, Abdur was insulted. ?I?ve heard that she is in an asylum. But why should I go back to her or send her a card tomorrow?? he asked.

 Minati?s father, Manoranjan Biswas, a former panchayat pradhan, is ?hesitant? to take her back home as he cannot forget the social humiliation he faced after she eloped with Abdur.

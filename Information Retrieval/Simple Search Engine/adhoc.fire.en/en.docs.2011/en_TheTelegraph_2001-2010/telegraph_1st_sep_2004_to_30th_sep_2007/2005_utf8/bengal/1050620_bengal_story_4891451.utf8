 Boys held for robbing teacher

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, June 19: Three boys aged between seven and 13 broke into the house of a senior teacher at Bethuadahari while he was away and looted and vandalised it, but they might get away without criminal proceedings as it was, after all, a teachers house.

 The police detained Kanai Mondal, 7, Prabal Dawn, 11, and Bidyut Biswas, 13, all school dropouts, this morning. 

 The boys were not arrested as Pranab Ghosal, the assistant headmaster of Paglachandi High School in Kaligunj, felt they needed counselling more than the trial of criminals.

 The accused children will be produced before the child welfare board in Calcutta next week and counselled so that they can get back to normal lives, the police said.

 The break-in occurred when Ghosal, with his wife and four-year-old son, went for a few days to his in-laws at Krishnagar last week. Cash and jewellery worth about Rs 5,000 were stolen and toys belonging to Ghosals son were smashed. All the rooms were ransacked and the rubber pipe was ripped off the gas oven.

 The cupboard in which my wife kept her little pieces of jewellery was broken. They also broke open a trunk and scribbled obscenities on the wall addressing my wife, said Ghosal. He lodged a complaint with the police on Thursday.

 A labourer woman stumbled upon an earring in an abandoned house, a few hundred metres from Ghosals, yesterday. Knowing about the theft, she took it to his wife. The teacher and his friends then found some of the other stolen items there. The police picked up the boys today.

 An officer said they wanted to press criminal charges against the boys but Ghosal requested them not to do so. I dont want to send them to jail, he said.

 Nakashipara police station officer-in-charge Anupam Chakraborty said the boys had fallen into bad company. They had even learnt to consume alcohol and ganja. Their parents are not willing to take them back home.

 Prabals father Pankaj, an electrician, said: I have apologised to the teacher for my sons crime. I have also requested the police to help him lead a normal life in the future.

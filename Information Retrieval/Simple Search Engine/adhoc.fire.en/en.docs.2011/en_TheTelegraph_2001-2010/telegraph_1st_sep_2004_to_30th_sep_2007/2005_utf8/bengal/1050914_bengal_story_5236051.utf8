 Asansol, Sept. 13: Four English-speaking youths aged between 17 and 20 went to Sidhyartha Shankar Daripa, a chemistry teacher, seeking tuition.

 Once inside the flat in a multi-storeyed apartment, yards away from the busy Asansol court area, about 240 km from Calcutta, one of them whipped out a revolver. The teacher was tied up and cash, ornaments and watches worth Rs 1.5 lakh were looted from his house. Daripas wife was away at a relatives house in Calcutta. Police said the miscreants operation continued for nearly an hour. I did not go to school today as I was running temperature, Daripa said. He was sleeping around 2 pm when the doorbell rang. I saw through the eyehole some youths standing outside. When I asked them what they wanted, they sought private tuition. They were speaking fluent English.

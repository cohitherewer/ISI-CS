 Author officer under probe

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta, Oct. 17: The government today ordered a probe into a senior police officers running down of a minister while the CPM, using the incident as a justification, ticked off the bureaucracy for being anti-communist.

 The order came in the wake of an article on Bartaman Samaj Adhunik Police (Contemporary Society and Modern Police) written by Enforcement Branch inspector-general Nazrul Islam in the Puja issue of Mangalpath, the mouthpiece for a union of non-gazetted police personnel. 

 In the piece, Islam alleged that animal resources devel- opment minister Anisur Rahman uses cars from dairies for personal purposes.

 We have ordered a probe. The home (police) department is looking into it, home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy said. 

 The author of 27 books and winner of the Indian Police Medal also wrote that despite restrictions on indiscriminate use of cars by ministers to cut down expenses, it was usual practice for most to use government vehicles for personal trips to the districts. 

 The IPS officer, who had earlier served as the city detective chief and the deputy commissioner, headquarters, also observed that leaders of all ruling parties across the country use the police force for their own gains. 

 Expressing shock over the article, Rahman, the MLA from Domkol in Murshidabad, about 235 km from Calcutta, said he had no clue why Islam picked on him. 

 What would a minister use other than a car? I have used a dairy pool car only on occasions, when my personal driver has been on leave or the car has been sent for repairs.

 The minister added that he had helped Islam, who is also from Domkol, set up the Domkol Engineering Institute of Technology and went to various places to raise funds for it.

 Nazrul declined comment on either his article or why he named only Rahman.

 However, referring to his writing, the state CPM secre- tary said the party knew that bureaucrats did not like communists. But we dont depend on them for our existence. Poor people and not bureaucrats are our source of strength.

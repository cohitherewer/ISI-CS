 Calcutta, Sept. 20: There is no controversy over Sania Mirzas skirts. Period.

 Muslim leaders today came out in support of the teen sensation from Hyderabad.

 We are proud of what Sania Mirza has achieved in her career so far. She has brought recognition to the country, especially in womens tennis, which was neglected so far. Not a single reputed religious leader anywhere in the country has issued any fatwa against her. 

 Islamic laws state that women should be properly dressed, but not a single progressive leader (has) ever thought of issuing any fatwa against her for turning up in skirts or shorts in court, Maulana Syed Nizamuddin, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board general secretary, told The Telegraph from Delhi.

 This is the first time that national leaders from her community tried to scotch debate over the propriety of Sanias sports gear, which made news as she broke into the Top 100 of the womens circuit with her breathtaking ground strokes and outrageous winners. 

 People who are making such comments do not have any locus standi, neither should their threats be taken seriously. We are praying that Sania performs well and wins the tournament (in Calcutta), and we will all pray for her, said Ahmed Hasan Imran, the general secretary of the Muslim Council of Bengal, which represents several minority organisations across the state.

 Muslim leaders in Bengal discussed the issue at length at a meeting yesterday and decided that Sania should be left alone. We respect the fact that it is not possible to play international tennis dressed in long skirts. The thought of issuing a fatwa has never crossed our minds, Hasan Imran added.

 After a meeting this evening, Muslim religious leaders came out with unanimous support for Sania. Her parents, Imran and Naseema, are very religious and they have inculcated religious beliefs in her, said Maulana Nizamuddin.

 The point of discussion today did not centre on Sania alone, but Muslim women, who are often accused of not covering their body in public. Why single out Sania for not adhering to Islamic customs. After all, she has brought glory to our country and community. Why are we forgetting the clothes filmstars in Bollywood or those in the fashion industry wear at work or outside? asked the Maulana.

 Progressive leaders have already started campaigning among community members that Sania should not be pressured with unwarranted comments. She is now world No. 34 and we hope that she goes all the way to the top. We do not want additional any pressure on her. She has nothing to fear in Calcutta, in Bengal or anywhere else. We have had detailed discussions with national leaders and everyone shares our view, said Hasan Imran.

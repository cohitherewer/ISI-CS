 Mother in net, pat for girl

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhagwangola, Sept. 11: Bilkis Khatun, the nine- year-old girl who fled home to lodge a police complaint against her mother for marrying her off to a man almost thrice her age, has been recommended for the Presidents bravery award.

 The mother and of the Class IV student of Natun Habaspur Primary School, Moyna Bibi, and the qazi who registered her marriage were arrested following the complaint. The way the little girl went to the police station (about 5 km away) alone and insisted on the officer accepting it is in itself a unique act of bravery. I have recommended her name to the President for the award, Murshidabad district magistrate N. Manjunathaa Prasad said.

 A resident of Natun Habaspur in Bagwangola, about 230 km from Calcutta, Bilkis was forced to marry her cousin Tufan Singh, 25, on July 14. Her father, a mason, was then working in Uttar Pradesh. 

 After the marriage, Tufan, also a mason, returned to work in Lucknow, as Bilkis continued to live with her mother.

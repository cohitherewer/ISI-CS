 First full-time pledge

 Calcutta, June 29: A flourishing legal practice behind him, Bikash Bhattacharyas stint as mayor is going to earn him a pittance.

 For the first time in the history of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the mayoral candidate will have to furnish an undertaking in his own handwriting that he will be a whole-time functionary at the CMC, said municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya. 

 The injunction is part of an amendment to the West Bengal Municipal Corporation Act in 2004, he added.

 The municipalities of Howrah, Chandannagore, Asansol and Siliguri will soon follow suit, with their chairmen submitting similar declarations.

 An injunction exists on zilla parishad and panchayat members, who cannot hold any office of profit.

 According to CMC officials, former mayor Subrata Mukherjee was the first to raise the ful-time cry. Subrata, who in addition to being mayor was an active trade union leader and an MLA, had argued that such an important post needs whole-hearted attention. 

 I had foregone my mayors allowance and only collected my MLAs allowance, he said.

 However, there is a silver lining for the mayor-designate. The mayors current allowance amounting to around Rs 4,000 is slated to go up.

 The board of councillors will decide on their allowances in a meeting. We will introduce a raise for the mayor, but we cannot compensate him to the level of his past earnings, the municipal affairs minister said.

 Shoot-at-sight for killer on the loose 

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Calcutta, March 22: He is a young male, a loner who prefers to keep to himself. 

 In June last year, he rebelled for an unknown cause, attacking and killing innocent people without provocation. 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government has passed a death sentence (a copy of which is with The Telegraph) on a young tusker who, according to the forest department, has become a rogue and is a threat to human life. 

 Roaming the forests of Beliatore, Gangajalghati and Barjora ranges in Bankura, the elephant has wreaked havoc. 

 On confronting people, it is known to chase and trample them. Between last June and this February, the animal has killed three people and injured many others. Numerous huts in the nearby villages have been demolished. 

 On June 24, 2004, the elephant struck for the first time, attacking Amar Bauri and Pratima Bauri at Dejuri and Madhabpur. The two were critically injured. 

 On January 27, Madhabpur became the target yet again. Tulsi, 48, was killed. Exactly a month later, Fatik Bauri, 40, was crushed to death when the animal strayed into Lakshminarayanpur in Barjora. The next day, a couple was attacked at Radhurbaid village. Chuni Bala Nandi, 65 and Anil, 70, were mauled.

 Conservationist D.K. Lahiri Choudhury said the animal should have been hunted down earlier. ?It shouldn?t have been allowed to roam free. Because of the continuing ordeal, the villagers might try to poison the animal, which could result in a number of innocent elephants being killed,? said the member of the Asian Elephants Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

 There can be several reasons for an elephant to turn a rogue. ?It could be injured, could have been turned out of its herd or lost temper being prevented from eating, when it is desperately looking for food,? Lahiri Choudhury said.

 In this case, the young male seems to have been expelled from the herd. A social animal, it must have been difficult for it to come to terms with the ouster.

 ?We are keeping a watch on it. The modalities of the hunt are being worked out,? said a forest officer of the Bankura division.

 EC scanner on ghosts

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 13: The Election Commission is now into ghost-busting.

 The states chief electoral officer has been told to provide the poll panel names of dead voters that have been removed from the electoral rolls.

 Electoral officer Debasish Sen will have to personally monitor the deletion of dead voters names. He will consult designated officers at polling booths and electoral registration officers in this regard. 

 As families of the dead do not usually come forward to volunteer deletion of their names, we are seeking help from political parties and local authorities, Sen said.

 Opposition parties allege that ghost voters, who impersonate people who are dead, are common during elections in the state. 

 Sen said lists of dead voters supplied by the parties are being tallied with the electoral rolls to make sure there are no ghosts during the mid-2006 Assembly elections.

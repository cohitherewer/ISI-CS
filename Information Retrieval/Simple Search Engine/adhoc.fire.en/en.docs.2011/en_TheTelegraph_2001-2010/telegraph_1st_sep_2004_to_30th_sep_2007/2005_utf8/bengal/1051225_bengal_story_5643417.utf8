 Two bodies: off lake amp; in park

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 24: Two persons were found dead in the open in different parts of the city this morning. 

 There were no injury marks on either of them. 

 The body of a 65-year-old man was spotted on the edge of the Dhakuria lakes. He was lying on his back. A jute bag containing cooking masala was recovered from there. We examined the body thoroughly, but there was no sign of any injury, said an officer of the Lake police station.

 Police identified the man as Sukur Khan, a resident of Topsia Road. We went to his house and his family members told us that he had left home like other days to sell the cooking stuff in the local markets. They did not suspect any foul play, said another officer.

 Khan, according to the preliminary investigation, probably suffered a heart attack and collapsed. Nothing can be said for certain until the post-mortem report reaches us and our investigation is on. We are examining all those with whom Khan was associated, the officer added.

 The other body, found in Rawdon Square in the Shakespeare Sarani police station area, has yet to be identified. The police said he appeared to be a pavement dweller in his mid-30s .

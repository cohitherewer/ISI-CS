 Industry voice in green jury

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 11: The complaint, so long, from a section of industrialists was that pollution control norms are so strict that it is difficult to do business in Bengal.

 They should have something to cheer about as the government announced today that starting September, the processes of giving consent to establish, operate or even impart closures to industries violating green norms will be dealt by broad-based committees comprising industry representatives.

 Now, it is an exclusive right of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board.

 The mechanism presently in practice has demerits like obscure transparency, absence of stakeholders participation and a centralised system, said environment minister Manab Mukherjee. 

 Keeping in mind the gaps in mechanism, the board has decided to put in external technical inputs in the decision- making process and involve various stakeholders, Mukherjee informed.

 Experts feel that this move is yet another policy of the government to have industry at any cost in the state. It is clearly an erosion of regulators power, which should be strengthened and not diluted, observed Anumita Roychoudhury of the Centre for Science and Environment. What is unbelievable is that the polluters themselves are being asked to be a part of such an important evaluation process.

 Board chairman Sudip Banerjee said: You have to keep in mind that the committees can at best recommend while the final power will continue to be with the board? there will be no dilution of power.

 The new committees ? 16 in all ? will have a dominant industry force. For instance, the committee on closure will have three of the four members from the industry.

 It is the result of pressure from the industry lobby... they could not find any other way to bypass the norms, admitted an environment department official. 

 The current mechanism of consent administration ? in place almost across the country since 2001 ? was based on recommendations from a Central Pollution Control Board panel. The new system ? borrowed from Andhra Pradesh by department secretary Asim Burman ? would be more transparent and quicken decision making, insisted minister Mukherjee.

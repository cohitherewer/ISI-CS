 Coal crisis stalls toy train

 VIVEK CHHETRI

 Darjeeling, March 29: The toy train?s train of travails touched a new low as a ?communication gap? caused a coal crisis, compelling officials to cancel the ?joy ride? today.

 Closed counters and a notice announcing the cancellation greeted tourists intent on taking the 14-km ride from Darjeeling to Ghoom on the steam-powered train.

 Though no official explanation was forthcoming, a source in the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway said ?shortage of coal had forced them to call off the rides? ? for the second time in six months and for the same reason. Coal supply had been hit by floods last October. 

 Coal from Asansol is transported to Siliguri, from where supplies are sent to Darjeeling on the basis of requirement. ?Today?s crisis was caused by a miscommunication,? said the Northeast Frontier Railway?s public relations officer. ?Though there is a scarcity of coal even in Siliguri, we had enough to keep the joy ride going. We had not been informed about the shortage.? 

 The engines consume around 600 kg of coal on each ride. ?We only have 600 kg of coal in our godown and as there are more reservations tomorrow, we thought of using it tomorrow,? an official said. 

 For Ashish Jain, however, it means a ?lost chance?. The tourist from Indore, who will head for Gangtok tomorrow, had stopped over at Darjeeling only to take the ride. ?I don?t know if I will ever have the opportunity again,? he said.

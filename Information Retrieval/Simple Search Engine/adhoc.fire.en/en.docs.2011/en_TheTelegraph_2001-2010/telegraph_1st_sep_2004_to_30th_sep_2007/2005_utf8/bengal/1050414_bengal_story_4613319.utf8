 Self-goal derails train cheats

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, April 13: They could master the art of the masquerade but forgot to learn how to spot the authentic.

 Two men posing as ticket checkers on the Kalka Mail got a ticket to prison when they approached members of the railway?s anti-fraud squad by mistake. To make matters worse, the genuine Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) was giving them company.

 Sanat Sarkar and his ?assistant? Anjan Mukherjee were caught red-handed last night when they asked the anti-fraud squad, sitting with the TTE, for tickets. 

 The duo was arrested from a three-tier reserved compartment of the Kalka Mail, from Howrah, when it stopped at Asansol station.

 Dressed as TTEs ? black coats with fake metal number plates on their lapels and identity cards in place ? Sarkar and Mukherjee have been running the racket in long-distance trains for a year. 

 They would promise berths against money to passengers without reservations and collect fines from free trippers. They also issued fake money receipts. 

 Sarkar and Mukherjee ? the former is a resident of Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh and the other hails from Uttarpara in Hooghly ? were handed over to the government railway police. They have been remanded in police custody.

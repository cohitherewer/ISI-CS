 Blind girl raped

 Krishnagar, March 5: A 14-year-old blind girl was attacked and raped allegedly by a youth of her own village last night while she was asleep in her house, reports our correspondent. 

 Fifteen-year-old Madhu Biswas, from Matiari village, 110 km from Calcutta, entered the girl?s room while her mother was sleeping in the next room. Her father, Shyamal Biswas, a fisherman, was away.

 Shyamal returned early this morning to find his daughter bleeding profusely and lying senseless. The girl, with bruises all over her body, was rushed to hospital. Doctors said she had been assaulted before being raped. 

 A weeping Biswas said: ?Madhu entered the house around midnight and stuffed clothes into my daughter?s mouth so that she could not scream.?

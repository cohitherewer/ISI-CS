 Subrata scot-free

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 19: Mamata Banerjee today cracked the whip on two Trinamul Congress MLAs but spared mayor Subrata Mukherjee, whose flirting with the Congress she had vowed not to ?tolerate?. 

 Nirbed Roy and Paras Dutta, the legislators from Tamluk and Behala (East), were tonight suspended for ?going against the party line?. 

 The duo had been harping on a tie-up with the Congress for the civic polls, defying Mamata?s diktat. The charge against Mukherjee was much the same. The mayor had also been advocating a pact with the parent party to ?avert a split in anti-CPM votes?. He even met Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, apparently to discuss poll ploy.

 Asked if any action against Mukherjee was being mulled, party president Subrata Bakshi said: ?His name was not discussed.? He also denied reports of a showcause notice to Mukherjee. 

 Bakshi, also part of a disciplinary committee, said the party took strong exception to the manner in which the two MLAs ?deliberately skipped? a three-day session in Contai a few months back. ?Nobody is above the organisation. Those going against the party will be severely dealt with,? he added. 

 Sources said Mamata ratified the committee?s recommendation for the suspensions. 

 The sources also claimed that there was a thaw in the relations between Mamata and the mayor after he expressed willingness to hold talks to clear misunderstandings on policy matters. ?I am ready to talk to Mamata any moment. So far as me and Mamata are concerned, there is no scope for confusion. Everything will be sorted out once we meet across the table,? said Mukherjee. 

 Mamata did not appear before the media, but told her aides she was open to talks to clear the confusion in the party?s rank and file. 

 Though she has ruled out a pact with the Congress as long as it had a truck with the CPM at the Centre, Mukherjee feels the party should enter into unofficial seat adjustments to retain the city civic board.

 Cancer waits for technicians to turn up

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Jan. 5: Over two dozen cancer patients here have sought the district administration?s help, fed up with the absence of technicians at the radiotherapy unit of Burdwan Medical College and Hospital.

 The hands crunch has halted the treatment of several cancer patients. Health officials estimate that there are some 700 patients whose treatment depends on the radiotherapy unit in Burdwan. 

 The problem arose in November when the only technician went on leave. In December, a replacement was provided from the X-ray department. But this technician also stopped coming in from January 1 as his deputation was not renewed.

 Outside Calcutta, there are only three radiotherapy centres ? in Burdwan, Bankura and North Bengal medical colleges. 

 District magistrate Subrata Gupta today sent the memorandum submitted by the patients to the chief medical officer of health (CMOH), Santosh Sarengi, and asked him to file a report after an inquiry. 

 ?We are concerned about the plight of cancer patients. We have sought a report on this from the CMOH,? Vinod Kumar, the additional district magistrate said. The CMOH has already spoken to the medical college authorities about the memorandum. 

 ?Patients earlier came from Burdwan and Purulia districts to the BMCH. But after the radiotherapy unit in Bankura stayed closed for two and half months, the number of cancer patients coming to the BMCH unit has grown,? an official said.

 Among the patients who submitted the memorandum is 42-year-old Swati Das from Burdwan town. She suffers from intestinal cancer. ?I am close to death today. I was getting some relief from radiotherapy for the past six months at the BMCH,? she said. 

 ?Now, I am not getting any date for the next session because there is no technician. We have repeatedly informed the hospital but no action has been taken.?

 On December 19, The Telegraph had reported how the medical facility was suffering from the scarcity of hands to man their X-ray, CT scan, ECG and EEG machines. 

 ?We are helpless... We can?t give dates to patients for radiotherapy sessions. My patients are suffering immensely,? said Dr Subir Ganguly, the head of the radiotherapy department. Deputy superintendent of BMCH Manju Murshed said he had repeatedly told the health authorities of the shortage. ?But, our requests have fallen on deaf ears,? he said.

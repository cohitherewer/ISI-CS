 Leather units under one roof

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 26: With the relocation of tanneries to Bantala?s Calcutta Leather Complex almost done, there is a scurry to shift all leather units to one address.

 Commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said leather and related units are scattered all over the city.

 Leather chemicals and colour-producing industries, leather goods-manufacturing units and finished leather trading centres are among those that will have a new home in Bantala?s sprawling 1,100-acre complex.

 At present, leather chemical units are located in Tangra, Beliaghata, Topsia and Howrah, while leather goods manufacturing units and leather trading centres are in Beniapukur, Park Circus, Garden Reach and Kidderpore.

 The complex will house an emporium displaying leather products, wholesale trading centres, the Central Leather Research Institute and a leather studio-cum-design centre, which will be the first of its kind in the eastern region. 

 The slaughterhouse will also be shifted to the complex from Tangra.

 ?The leather complex has been planned to come up as a comprehensive and integrated centre under which all the units will become operational. There will be no leather-based units in and around the city, but finished goods will be exhibited in showrooms,? Sen said. 

 Discussions are on with the complex promoter, M.L. Dalmiya ad Co., he added.

 Sen said the promoter had informed the government before allotting the land. ?The government will not interfere with matters relating to plot allocation and cost of land. No industries other than those related to leather will be provided land in the complex.?

 Pranab finger at factions

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 29: State Congress president Pranab Mukherjee today held factionalism responsible for the partys poor showing in the civic polls.

 It is true that infighting coupled with organisational lapses cost us dear in the municipality elections. Now our primary job is to stem the rot on a war footing, Mukherjee told reporters at his south Calcutta residence.

 The CPM swept the polls, winning in 52 municipalities, while the Congress bagged only 10, four less than 2000. Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress lagged far behind by winning only three.

 The Congress suffered one of its worst setbacks in Murshidabad, where party candidates who were denied tickets entered the fray as Independents, much to the embarrassment of the leadership. 

 Our performance is worse than that of the last municipality elections held in 2000. What will people think about us if leaders speak publicly against one another? he asked, referring to the continuous mudslinging between Adhir Chowdhury, the Congress MP from Behrampore, and Atish Sinha, the chief of the Congress Legislature Party.

 Mukherjee, the Union defence minister, said the results would have been better had he given more time to campaigning. Due to my pre-occupation in Delhi, I could not devote much time to electioneering in Bengal.

 The state Congress chief today also formalised the launching of a joint manifesto after a meeting with mayor Subrata Mukherjee. He urged party members to desist from entering into any sort of alliance with Mamata. We shall release a joint manifesto on behalf of the United Democratic Alliance on June 2

 I have reports that some party leaders are keen to join hands with the Trinamul Congress despite it being an ally of the BJP. But if party councillors make adjustments at the local level to keep the ruling CPM at bay, then we have no control on them, he said in reply to a question.

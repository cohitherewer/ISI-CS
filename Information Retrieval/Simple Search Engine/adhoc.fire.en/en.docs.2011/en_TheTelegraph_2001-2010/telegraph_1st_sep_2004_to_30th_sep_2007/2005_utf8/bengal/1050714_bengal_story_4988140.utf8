 Delay averts cop massacre

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Bandwan, July 13: Fortune favoured the officer-in-charge of Bandwan police station, Sadhan Pathak, but not Prabal Sengupta, the officer-in-charge of Barikul thana.

 The rebels removed a high-power mine planted to kill Pathak half-an-hour before he travelled to Dulukdihi village, where CPM zonal committee member Mahendra Mahato was shot dead on Saturday. This was revealed four days after Mahato was killed in Dulukdihi.

 Though four persons, including Sengupta, were killed, the attackers had a plan to eliminate at least 20 to 30 police personnel in their twin strikes in Dulukdihi and Majhgeria. Fortunately, police, in both the cases, rushed to the spot more than two hours after the incident. Had they moved in immediately, their vehicles might have been blown up, said a Purulia police official.

 During investigation, the police came to know that a group of seven to 10 guerrillas, armed with carbines and AK-47s took refuge in the jungle along the half-km stretch of the gravelled road leading towards Mahatos house.

 The rest of the 30-member group proceeded towards the jungles close to the Bandwan-Kendbani road to plant a mine. The first group was waiting for the arrival of BSF jawans from the Rasikngar camp, one-and-half-km from Mahatos residence. Had the jawans rushed to Mahatos house immediately on receiving the information of the attack, a number of them could have been gunned down, said the official.

 Elaborating on the trap laid by the Maoists, another police official said: They took position close to Bandwan hill. They planted a directional mine ? a high-power explosive that hangs from the branch of a tree and explodes when the target reaches beneath it. 

 The rebels waited behind a roadside bush clutching an end of the wire connected to the mine. They were waiting for the police jeep from Bandwan thana. Had the jeep come on time, they would have blown it up.

 The Maoists waited till 3.15 am, nearly seven hours after carrying out the operation at Dulukdihi. When the Bandwan OC did not turn up, the rebels decided to remove the mine and leave, knowing it would become difficult to flee after daybreak, said another official.

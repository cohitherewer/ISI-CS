 Unfazed Biswas calms flock

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Balurghat, Nov. 2: Narayan Biswas looked unfazed as he emerged from court this evening and strode towards a waiting police Sumo.

 Hundreds of CPM workers wearing black badges had gathered around the court and were chanting ?Narayan Biswas zindabad? as the former minister was sent to jail in connection with a 16-year-old arson and looting case.

 ?Please return home, let the law run its own course, this is a political battle and my party will also tackle it politically,? he appealed as his supporters raised slogans of ?Chakrantakari Trinamul hushiar? (Conspirator Trinamul, beware).?

 Biswas arrived for the court hearing in a Maruti, accompanied by lawyers Sekhar Das Gupta and Biplab Mitra.

 Trinamul district secretary Biplab Mitra tried to slip in a word during the hearing but was strongly opposed by Biswas?s lawyers. But chief judicial magistrate Anjali Sinha, who rejected Biswas?s bail pleas, allowed him to speak.

 ?Now that he is under arrest he should resign as legislator as well,? Mitra said later. Mitra was Biswas?s rival from Gangarampur in the last Assembly elections.

 Biswas was remanded in judicial custody till November 16 in connection with a 1988 case of torching 22 houses in Gangarampur and till November 7 in a 1980 political violence case.

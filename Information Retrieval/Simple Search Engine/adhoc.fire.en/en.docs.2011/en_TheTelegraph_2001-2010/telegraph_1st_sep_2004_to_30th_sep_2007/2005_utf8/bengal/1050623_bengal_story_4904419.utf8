 Mamata plots strategy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 22: The poor showing in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation polls notwithstanding, Mamata Banerjee is raring to have a go at the Left Front from Day One. 

 We will have to fight the Left Front tooth and nail both inside the civic body and outside, the Trinamul Congress chief told her party leaders today. 

 She added that a strategy must be drawn up soon.

 Mamata held a separate meeting with Ajit Panja, who was elected from ward 63, defeating the Left Front-backed nominee, Nawal Joshi. 

 Panja described his discussion with Mamata as positive and fruitful.

 He, however, refused to comment on whether he would be picked as leader of Opposition in the civic body. 

 Trinamul sources said Mamata has a tough choice between Panja and Javed Ahmed Khan, a mayor-in-council member in the outgoing civic board. 

 Khan was made leader of the Trinamuls municipal party after Subrata Mukherjee broke away to float the Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha. 

 The party will discuss the matter threadbare at a working committee meeting to be held shortly. It is also expected to come up tomorrow, when Mamata meets senior party leaders at her south Calcutta residence. 

 Trinamul insiders said Mamata wants to offer the post to Khan following his victory by a record margin. 

 They added that Khan would also help the Trinamul consolidate her Muslim vote-bank with Assembly polls round the corner. 

 However, Khans elevation may not go down well with the rest of the 45 councillors ? including three from ally BJP ? two of whom were re-elected this time. This is a very knotty issue and we have to take a decision after taking all aspects into consideration, a Trinamul leader said. 

 Mamata is also preparing a list of dos and donts for councillors, who will be sworn in by the first week of July. 

 They will be asked to regularly raise issues concerning lack of civic amenities in their wards at the monthly civic body meetings. We will have to be alert, keeping an eye on next years Assembly elections, said Trinamuls all-India general secretary Mukul Roy.

 The councillors will also be in touch with a core group in the party overseeing corporation affairs, Roy added.

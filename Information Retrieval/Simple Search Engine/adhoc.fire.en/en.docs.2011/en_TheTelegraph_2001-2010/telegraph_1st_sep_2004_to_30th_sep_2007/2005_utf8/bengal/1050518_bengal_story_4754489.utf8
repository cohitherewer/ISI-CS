 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, May 17: Jayanta Biswas, 12, had a ear chopped off before being stabbed and thrown into a bush last night by Raju Sarkar, a cattle trader whom he called uncle and had accompanied on a business trip.

 Jayanta, a Class VI student of the Jamunasundari High School at Hanskhali, 75 km from Calcutta, went to Krishnaganj with Sarkar to see how he worked. Little did he know that he was a cattle smuggler. When Jayanta learnt that, he threatened to expose him. Residents found him writhing in pain in a mango orchard early this morning. Police have started a case against Sarkar on the basis of Jayantas statement. Sarkar is absconding.

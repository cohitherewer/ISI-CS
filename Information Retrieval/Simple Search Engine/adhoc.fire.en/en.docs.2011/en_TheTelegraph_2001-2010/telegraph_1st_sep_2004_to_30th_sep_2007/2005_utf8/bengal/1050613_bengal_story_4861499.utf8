 CPM shot at truce ends in police firing

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Purulia, June 12: A shalishi (conciliation) meeting in a CPM office turned violent today forcing police to step in and open fire. 

 Three people, part of a mob that attacked the police with brickbats and stones, were injured in the firing at Dubra, 270 km from Calcutta.

 Purulia police chief R. Shivkumar said seven policemen, including two officers, were injured when brickbats were hurled at them. The police fired four rounds in which three villagers were injured. We have arrested 15 people.

 The villagers claimed that over six rounds were fired and five of them were hurt.

 Puna Rajwar, 15, of neighbouring Putulia village, allegedly went missing from a landlords house where he worked on May 28. The landlord, Banku Mahato lodged a missing diary with the police on May 29 and asked his father Barun to look for him.

 Barun, along with other villagers, searched for Puna at all probable places, but in vain. Then he began suspecting that Banku had killed his son and hidden the body. The villagers coaxed him to demand damages, a police officer said. 

 Barun sought Rs 3 lakh from Banku. When tension over the issue mounted, local CPM leaders stepped in.

 The partys Dubra local committee called a meeting in its office yesterday but it remained inconclusive. Another meeting was called today where Barun again demanded Rs 3 lakh as compensation for his missing son. Both meetings were presided over by the secretary of the CPMs local committee, Kartick Chandra Mahato, and attended by Banku. 

 Hundreds of villagers waited outside the CPM office for the outcome.

 When Banku again refused to pay up, Barun alerted the waiting villagers, who began baying for his blood. 

 The villagers demanded that Banku be handed over to them. At this, the CPM leader became tensed and informed the police. We realised that a mob fury was building up and sent a police team, a senior officer said. Seeing the police arrive, the villagers started hurling brickbats. The police fired at them and Jyoti Rajwar and Bishu Rajwar were hit.

 Reinforcements were sought and Raghunathpur circle inspector Tushar Kanti Guha rushed with a large contingent. The mob also attacked the second police team. Guha was among the policemen injured. His force again opened fire. 

 The missing boys father said during the second police firing, three more were injured, including 12-year-old Santosh Rajwar.

 Shivkumar went to the spot and Rapid Action Force jawans were deployed.

 This is the second instance of mob violence against the police in Purulia in three days. Last Thursday, assistant sub-inspector Parameswar Mahato was killed in the Nituri area when he refused to hand over a motorcycle thief to a mob.

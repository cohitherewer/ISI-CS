 Rapped, high court cracks whip on govt

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 prompt action

 Calcutta, Nov. 17: A day after being admonished by the Supreme Court for delays in delivering judgments, Calcutta High Court turned its wrath on the state government.

 The high court today asked the government to reply by Tuesday why it had failed to carry out its order passed in 1990, directing it to appoint a headmaster in a Burdwan school. 

 Durgapada Das was appointed headmaster of Deno Sachchidanana School in Burdwan town in 1973. The school was not recognised by the government then. Being paid a paltry salary of Rs 110 a month, Das took up a temporary job in the Burdwan district judges? court with the school management?s permission.

 When the school got recognition in 1987, the management, asked to furnish a list of names for various posts, did not recommend any name for the headmaster.

 Das moved the high court, which directed the state education department to appoint a headmaster immediately. ?The judge had also asked the government to call Das before the interview board set up for appointing the headmaster,? advocate Tapas Bhanja, Das?s counsel, told the court today.

 ?But the order has not been carried out till today. As a result, Durgapada Das, who has been deprived of the headmaster?s post, and a large number of students of the school, which is without a head, have been suffering,? he added.

 The school has been running with a teacher-in-charge.

 ?A contempt petition was filed in 1991, which is still pending before the court,? the lawyer said.

 Bhanja also reminded the court about the apex court?s observations yesterday. ?But there are hundreds of cases pending with the court as the administration has not carried out its orders.?

 Fracas over free-tripper SFI duo

 Krishnagar, July 11: Kalyani station turned into a battlefield today as SFI supporters clashed with police after two students were held for trying to board a train without tickets, reports our correspondent. 

 Eight students and 12 policemen were injured in a pitched battle that started around noon. Train services in the Kalyani-Ranaghat section were disrupted for over three hours. 

 Government Railway Police have 

 lodged an FIR against the two ticket-less students, Rajesh 

 Majumdar and Shaunak Banerjee. 

 Majumdar, the zonal secretary 

 of the CPM students wing, and Banerjee, a first-year 

 student of Kalyani College were asked to show their tickets 

 while waiting for a train to Sealdah. We are SFI members. 

 How dare you ask for tickets from us? the duo told 

 ticket checker S.K. Pandey. They threatened me in 

 abusive language as I insisted on their paying the fine, 

 he said. 

 After the duo was detained, students from Kalyani College, the Industrial Training Institute there and other educational institutions poured into the station. Some tried to free their friends from custody and the clash started, station manager S.C. Mukherjee said. 

 MP maintenance

 Calcutta High Court today set aside an order directing Diapnkar Mukhopadhyay, a CPM Rajya Sabha member, to pay maintenance of Rs 2,500 every month to his former domestic help. The additional chief judicial magistrate, Sealdah, had asked him to pay the money to Bindu Sarkar, who claimed to be his deserted wife.

 Great Eastern pay-off 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 15: The 400-odd employees of Great Eastern Hotel have been offered between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 4 lakh under an early retirement scheme (ERS).

 Member secretary and chief executive officer of the Great Eastern Hotel Authority Jagannath Bag said the employees would be officially asked to apply for the scheme after it is okayed by the board at a meeting on Friday. ?We shall paste the details of the scheme on our notice board and ask our employees to apply for it within a fixed time,? he added.

 Unable to run the over-a-century-old hotel profitably, the state government advertised in dailies a few months ago inviting expressions of interest from private entrepreneurs. 

 Eleven groups were shortlisted from among those who wanted to acquire the hotel. The bidders included ITC, Park Hotels, Inter Continental South West Asia and Bharat Hotels. Claridges Hotel, the Unitech Group, Kenilworth and Sinclairs Hotels, too, were in the race.

 The ERS, according to a government official, is aimed at reducing the workforce as no entrepreneur will acquire the hotel with an overload. ?As things stand now, two packages ? one for 379 permanent staff and another for 60 contract employees ? have been planned.?

 Permanent employees, who have worked for 25 years but have three years to reach the age of retirement, will get 25?45 = 1,125 days? salary. A person who has served for 20 years but has five years to reach the retirement age will get 20?25 = 500 days? salary. The contract employees will be offered 45 days? salary for every year they have put in. A tourism department official said: ?The maximum limit of retirement benefit for an employee will be not more than Rs 4 lakh.?

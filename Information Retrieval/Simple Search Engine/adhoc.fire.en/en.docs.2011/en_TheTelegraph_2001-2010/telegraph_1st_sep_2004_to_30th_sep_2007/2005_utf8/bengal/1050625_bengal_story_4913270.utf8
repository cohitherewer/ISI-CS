 Cripple threat in Mamata war cry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 24: Mamata Banerjee today threatened to bring the city to a standstill if the CPM-led civic body imposes water tax on Calcuttans.

 We will not allow water tax to be imposed on the people of Calcutta. If the CPM mayor takes any such decision, we will bring the city to a standstill, she told a gathering at Esplanade this afternoon, firing her first salvo at the yet-to-be constituted Left Front board.

 The Trinamul chief made it clear that her partys councillors would not make the new mayors task easy from the Opposition ranks. They will protest against any step against the peoples interests. We shall make the CPM realise what a peoples movement is all about, Mamata said.

 Observers viewed the threat as another instance of her brand of disruptive politics. State CPM secretary Anil Biswas said: Stung by a humiliating defeat, Trinamul leaders are talking rubbish. 

 During a sit-in to protest against the Centres decision to hike fuel prices, Mamata slammed the Left for supporting the Congress-led government in Delhi and staging a mock fight against the party in the state. She also ruled out the possibility of a Trinamul alliance with the Congress because of its pact with the Left.

 She later led a party delegation to governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi and submitted a memorandum on large-scale rigging by CPM cadre in the CMC and Salt Lake polls. 

 The delegation included leader of Opposition in the Assembly Pankaj Banerjee and party chief whip Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, who lost the election to former Trinamul mayor Subrata Mukherjee. CPM workers had tampered with electronic voting machines to ensure their candidates victory, the delegation alleged.

 Police cover taken off plot scam judge

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 20: A week after the government offered him Rs 8.19 lakh to vacate his two-storey Salt Lake residence, police withdrew guards from retired high court judge Bhagabati Prosad Banerjee?s house.

 The Supreme Court had dismissed the allotment of Banerjee?s FD block plot ? obtained from the chief minister?s quota in 1987 under ?inappropriate circumstances? ? and asked the government to auction the house and take over the land. 

 Last week, the urban development department offered Rs 8.19 lakh as the price of the house. The retired judge, however, refused the offer saying it was far below the market price. In a letter to the urban development department yesterday, Banerjee demanded that a valuer from the high court?s panel be asked to do the job.

 Six armed policemen were deployed at his house in 2000 following a central directive after his order banning the use of microphones for ajaan and other religious chants between 10 pm and 6 am. 

 This afternoon, a police team went to Banerjee?s house and urged him to release the guards. They showed a letter from North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar, which said the policemen had to be withdrawn ?as we have to send policemen to Jharkhand and Bihar for election duty??.

 The officers urged Banerjee to sign on the letter but he refused. ?I have not urged anybody to deploy policemen in front of my house, so why should I put my signature to release them? The government provided me security as there was a threat to my life and, now, if the government feels that there is no longer any need for it, let it be withdrawn. But I can neither say yes nor no,?? Banerjee told the police team.

 The policemen on duty at Banerjee?s house have been asked to report at the district police headquarters tomorrow.

 Home secretary Amit Kiran Deb said he had no information on the withdrawal of guards. ?It is a fact that we have to send armed policemen to Jharkhand and Bihar on election duty. So, we have asked all district administrations to withdraw policemen from different camps. But I don?t know why all the guards have been withdrawn from Banerjee?s house. I shall speak to the director-general of police,?? he said.

 Kumar insisted that the step was prompted by the poll schedule. ?We have to mobilise two companies of armed policemen for the neighbouring states?Where shall we get so many of them?? He did not clarify if such camps at other VIP homes in Salt Lake would also be wound up.

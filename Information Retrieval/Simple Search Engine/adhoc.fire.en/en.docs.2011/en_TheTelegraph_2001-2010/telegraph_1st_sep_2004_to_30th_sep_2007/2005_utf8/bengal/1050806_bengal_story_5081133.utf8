 Schools shut

 Kalyani, Aug. 5: About 250 para-teachers in about 100 primary and secondary schools of Nadias Nakashipara today forced the authorities to close doors in protest against the administrations refusal to renew their yearly contracts. 

 The district administration said the contracts could not be renewed because of dearth of funds. There are about 5,000 para-teachers (posted on a temporary basis) in about 1,500 schools in Nadia.

 CPM stops grants test 

 - Jolt to teachers and students alike 

 OUR BUREAU 

 Feb. 16: Trouble erupted in primary schools in Birbhum and West Midnapore districts when CPM-controlled local village education committees forcibly prevented an organisation inimical to the ruling coalition from holding scholarship tests for students of Class IV. 

 The Primary Education Development Board, a non-government organisation of a group of anti-CPM educationists and academicians, has been conducting the tests for 14 years in protest against the government?s primary education policies, including abolition of English at the primary level. Alarmed at its popularity, the government banned the examinations last year. 

 The examinations began yesterday. Today, as students settled down for the mathematics test at Kendradangal Ansik Buniadi Vidyalaya in Birbhum, 210 km from Calcutta, members of the local education committee began protesting. The school authorities were forced to stop the test. 

 ?We cannot allow any private body to use the premises of state-aided primary schools as venues for holding examinations that are banned by the government. We will showcause the officials of schools like Kendradangal Ansik Buniadi Vidyalaya for allowing the organisation to hold the examinations,? said Goutam Ghosh, chairman of Birbhum District Primary Council. 

 At Nayagram in West Midnapore, 180 km from Calcutta, there was trouble in another state-aided primary school when the headmaster of Nayagram High School refused to give permission to the NGO to hold the examination on its premises. The organisers made the necessary arrangements in a nearby cycle-stand where the students took the test sitting on the floor. 

 In Calcutta, NGO secretary Kartick Saha came down heavily on the CPM-controlled panchayats and village education committees. ?We have received reports of trouble. The CPM is trying to create a fear psychosis among parents by disrupting the examinations. We are taking all possible steps to hold the examinations peacefully across the state. We will be successful as we have the full support of the guardians,? Saha said. 

 The scholarship test has become popular because it includes tests in English along with other subjects like Bengali, Hindi and mathematics. The scholarship of Rs 500 to Rs 1000 to 500 students has also contributed to its increasing popularity.

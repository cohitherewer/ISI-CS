 Teachers aid leper as family turns back 

 RABI BANERJEE

 Nirmala digs earth to patch up the walls of her shelter. 

 Plassey, Jan. 4: For Nirmala Mondal, the teachers of Teznagar Primary School are ?everything?. Had they not spotted the leprosy patient begging, Nirmala might not have lived.

 The 35-year-old from Kaligunj in Nadia district, 170 km from Calcutta, was shown the door by her farmer husband Dhiren five years ago. ?Seeing the marks on my leg, he asked me to leave his house immediately,? she said.

 Her father Balaram Mondal, also a farmer, then took her home. He also took Nirmala to Kaligunj Block Hospital. The doctor assured her that leprosy was curable and said the medicines should be taken regularly.

 But in her own family, the same ignorance that made Dhiren turn his wife away prevailed. Nirmala?s three younger brothers insisted that she leave the house. 

 ?My brothers and their wives boycotted me. They asked me to stop having food with them. My mother gave me separate utensils and asked me to cook my own food. She, too, joined them,? Nirmala lamented.

 She was forced to remain indoors. ?I had come to terms with my husband?s behaviour. But the attitude of my family members became unbearable,? a tearful Nirmala said.

 A year ago, her father suffered a stroke. The moment he died, Nirmala was driven out of the house.

 Left with nothing, she was reduced to begging. Her treatment also stopped. Her father had left her a cottah in nearby Teznagar, but she needed money to build a house. So, she wandered about till one day some Teznagar Primary School teachers noticed her. 

 They constructed a hut on her plot six months ago and asked her not to beg as she would get her food from the school?s mid-day meal. 

 ?How can we keep mum after seeing her misery? So, we helped her out with shelter and food. It is true that we are struggling to keep the mid-day meal going due to lack of funds. But we will continue to help her,? said headmaster Indrajit Biswas. 

 Nirmala had applied to the local panchayat for money to construct a shelter under the Indira Awas Yojna. But, there had been no response. 

 At the insistence of the teachers, she started going to the nearby health centre and started taking medicines. The spread of leprosy has now been arrested. 

 Taking note of the teachers? efforts to help her, Anisur Rahaman, the panchayat pradhan, promised to recommend her case to the panchayat and ensure that she received all assistance possible. 

 ?We will make sure she gets the assistance she deserves,? he said. 

 ?The school is every thing in my life. It saved me when I was about to die,? Nirmala said.

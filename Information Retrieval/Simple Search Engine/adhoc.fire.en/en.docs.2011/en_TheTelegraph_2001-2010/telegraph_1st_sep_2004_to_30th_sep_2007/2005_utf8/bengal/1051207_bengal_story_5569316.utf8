 Two deaths after theft slur

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Dec. 6: A mother killed her son and committed suicide after he was accused of stealing cabbages from a neighbouring village and beaten up. 

 Marshal Murmu, 11, had on Sunday morning strayed into a Jharkhand village bordering his house at Jamai- mari in Jhargram, West Midnapore, about 250 km from Calcutta. 

 The Class V student of Jamaimari Junior High School was allegedly caught picking cabbages there.

 As the news spread, his mother Anjali went to the spot with some of the neighbours. When she tried to reason with the residents there that her son was not a habitual thief, they insulted her.

 Anjali, 34, returned home with Marshal and kept herself locked in her room. 

 Seeing it locked since then, her next-door neighbour Surjya Kanta Murmu informed the Jhargram police last night. Policemen who broke open the door saw the mother and son lying dead. 

 Jhargram sub-divisional police officer Ajoy Thakur said: Going by circumstantial evidence, it appears that Anjali first forced her son to consume pesticide before she took it herself. We are awaiting the post-mortem report.

 Anjalis husband Sanatan had deserted her seven years ago. She lived with her son at Jamaimari village and worked as a farm labourer. 

 Thakur said it was yet to be confirmed whether Marshal had actually stolen cabbages. 

 A team of officials will visit the Jharkhand village to ascertain the facts.

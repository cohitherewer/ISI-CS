 Cancer care out of city confines

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan Jan. 9: The medical college and hospital here will be the first outside Calcutta to house a chemotherapy facility.

 A five-bed day-care unit for cancer patients will open tomorrow at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital. 

 Oncologist and head of the radiotherapy department Subir Ganguly said the chemotherapy medicines would be provided free to those who cannot afford them. ?We will build up a drug bank on chemotherapy and a Calcutta-based NGO has agreed to provide the medicines required and help us build the bank,? said Ganguly, who will head a team of five doctors in the new unit.

 Till the other day, the hospital did not have a technician to run its radiotherapy unit, which lay unused for months.

 Hundreds of cancer patients in Burdwan and the neighbouring districts suffered because of the dearth of hands to keep the radiotherapy unit ? launched amid fanfare less than two years ago ? running. 

 Ganguly said the lone technical hand in the radiotherapy unit was back early this month. The new unit, he added, would not suffer from any such problems. ?I assure you that this unit would run fine as it is totally doctor dependent.? 

 In Calcutta, only SSKM Hospital and Medical College and Hospital have chemotherapy facilities among state-run hospitals. Chittaranjan Cancer Research Centre, which is run by Delhi, also has them.

 At the new unit, patients will be admitted in the morning and released by night. 

 Ganguly said there are plans to open an ?indoor facility? in the Burdwan hospital, where patients can stay overnight.

 Almost 60 per cent of the 700-odd patients who come to the hospital?s radiotherapy department for treatment every year need chemotherapy. ?Not much could be done as there was no facility here. The patients, many of who also came from Bankura and Purulia, had to go to private hospitals and nursing homes. The day-care unit will be of immense help to them,? Ganguly said.

 Burdwan Medical College and Hospital officials said the new unit is also expected to attract patients from neighbouring Jharkhand as it is the first state-run chemotherapy facility in the region. 

 Principal Bijoy Mukherjee said the hospital is trying to reach out to more and more patients through the day-care unit.

 Ganguly said all antibiotics cannot be administered at the day-care unit. ?Some have severe side-effects and the patient has to be kept under observation. We will only use medicines with minimum side-effects so that the patients can be released by evening.?

 He also reminded that the drug bank would remain a concept if NGOs and other donors do not come forward with help and that ?more technicians are required to prevent a pile-up of patients?.

 Adhir bail verdict today

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 22: The high court is likely to decide tomorrow whether murder accused MP Adhir Chowdhury should be granted bail.

 Chowdhurys lawyers told a division bench of Justice A. Talukdar and Justice S.P. Mitra today that he had been falsely implicated in the murders of a father and son in Behrampore town on July 24.

 Lawyers Sekhar Basu and Jaymalya Bagchi alleged that the police had chargesheeted the Congress leader on the basis of a statement that had been withdrawn. 

 Moktar Ali, one of the five who allegedly went to kill Hanif and Laltoo Sheikh, had said before Behrampore chief judicial magistrate A.K. Pal that he was working under the MPs instructions. 

 The lawyers said: Soon after, Moktar had declared that the police had forced him to confess. But even after that, the police submitted the chargesheet against Chowdhury implicating him in the murder case.

 His wife, Arpita, a co-accused, has already been granted bail by the high court.

 Advocate-general Balai Ray will oppose the bail prayer tomorrow. 

 In the court of the Murshidabad district judge in Behrampore, the murders came up for hearing today. However, Chowdhury could not be produced as he reported sick.

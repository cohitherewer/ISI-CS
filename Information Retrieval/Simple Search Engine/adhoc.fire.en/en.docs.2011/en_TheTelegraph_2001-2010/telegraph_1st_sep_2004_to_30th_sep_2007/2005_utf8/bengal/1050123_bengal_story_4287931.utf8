 Police recce problem spots 

 - Army-cm date this week on preservation details

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Jan. 22: With the eyes of the courts on them, the army is jogging up a plan of action to preserve the Maidan while Calcutta Police made an early morning dash to discover what ails the lungs of the city. 

 Sharp at 7, three senior officers arrived at the Maidan. After a few hours, commissioner Prasun Mukherjee, deputy commissioner (headquarters) Ranvir Kumar and deputy commissioner (traffic) Arun Sharma said they did not like what they saw. 

 ?Yes, we toured the Maidan extensively and a lot can be done to preserve it. All agencies should work together to create a cleaner and greener Maidan, which the court has envisaged,? said Mukherjee.

 The team started at the spruced-up Eliot Park, opposite Tata Centre, and followed it up with visits to Prinsep Ghat, Shahid Minar and also the area opposite Babu Ghat and Eden Garden where Ganga Sagar pilgrims had put up camps. 

 Cleaning and planting saplings are the immediate steps on the police?s agenda. An area of major concern is near the Jawaharlal Nehru statue off the Park Street metro station. ?The area has to be developed by the government or a private entrepreneur to give it a better and greener look,? said a senior official.

 A dumping ground off the Maidan below the Vidyasagar Setu also offended the police officers and they are looking at a possibility of cleaning up the outer reaches of the greens as well. They are also mulling a transfer of the Vidyasagar traffic guard centre on Strand Road (beside Prinsep Ghat) to allow more breathing space to the monument. 

 As the police began their survey, Major General Z.U. Shah, the general officer commanding (Bengal area), was planning a meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and chief secretary Ashok Gupta to discuss preservation of the Maidan. 

 ?The priority must be to clean up the worst messed-up zones in the Maidan and then give attention to other areas. Over the years, staging of events, exhibitions and other programmes have left the Maidan in a bad state, but now we have identified the areas which must be beautified immediately to save the Maidan,? said an army spokesman. 

 The army also clarified that it does not want the private entrepreneurs who have taken up plots to beautify along the Jawaharlal Nehru Road to make any modification. ?No trees must be felled, nor can any permanent structure come up on the Maidan,? the spokesman added. 

 A meeting is scheduled early next week at Writers? Buildings. The army is open to efforts from every agency to beautify the Maidan.

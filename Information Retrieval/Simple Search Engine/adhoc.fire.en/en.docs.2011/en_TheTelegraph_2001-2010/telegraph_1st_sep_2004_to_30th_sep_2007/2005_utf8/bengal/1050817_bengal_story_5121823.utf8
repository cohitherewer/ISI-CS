 Progress pill for north trio

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 16: The CPM today summoned its party secretaries of Darjeeling, Cooch Behar and Jalpaiguri to Alimuddin Street to chalk out a strategy to counter the growing subversive activities of the KLO and other outfits. 

 The state government is planning a string of development projects in the three north Bengal districts, coupled with sustained movement against the outfits at the same time. 

 We have asked our key party members in the districts to identify areas where development work can be carried out?. The final discussion will take place at the CPMs state committee meeting, slated for August 21, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas said this afternoon. 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Nirupam Sen were present at the meeting, which observers find significant as the chief minister and the industry minister patiently heard those from north Bengal. 

 A blue print of the projects is being worked out taking into account core sectors like agriculture, education and industry.

 Probe into police probe

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Nov. 20: A woman was stripped and thrashed along with her visually chall-enged husband last year for protesting against local youths wanting to tap electricity from their house. 

 A police report filed following a probe into the charges of Bishakha Durlav and her husband Sanatan said they had settled the dispute and the case was shut until the couple drew the attention of the district police chief last week. 

 The culprits are still roaming free, the residents of Kri- shnagunj, about 110 km from Calcutta, wrote to district superintendent R. Rajsekharan.

 The Nadia police today ordered a restart of the case.

 The earlier investigation report had said that the couple had amicably settled the row with the intervention of a panchayat member, Dulal Biswas. There is no panchayat member by that name, though. 

 Prafulla Saha, a deputy superintendent of police, had carried out the probe. The relation between the complainant and accused is peaceful... the dispute between them was settled in the presence of local panchayat member Dulal Biswas, says his report, a copy of which is with The Telegraph.

 Rajsekharan said: I was surprised after I went through the complaint. Ill definitely inquire why the mistake occurred in the police report.

 We do not know how the matter was settled or who Dulal Biswas is. There is no panchayat member in our area by that name, said Bishakha.

 The panchayat brass corroborated her. There is no member by the name of Dulal Biswas. We will co-operate with Bishakha and Sanatan to help them get justice in the case, said Pradip Biswas, the chief of the local Banpur rural body.

 The trouble started in February last year when members of a local club wanted free electricity from Sanatans house. When he refused, the youths beat up the couple and allegedly stripped Bishakha and molested her. 

 Sanatan and Bishakha, who were taken to the Krishnagunj block hospital unconscious, took a week to recover. 

 The Krishnagunj police accepted a complaint but did nothing more. 

 Bishakha then approached the state womens commission and it took up the case with the police.

 Vice-chairperson of the panel Rama Das today said: We will seek a re-investigation by a higher officer. Such things shall not be tolerated.

 Bishakha said the youths who had attacked the couple are again threatening them.

 Prafulla Saha, the DSP, re- fused to comment.

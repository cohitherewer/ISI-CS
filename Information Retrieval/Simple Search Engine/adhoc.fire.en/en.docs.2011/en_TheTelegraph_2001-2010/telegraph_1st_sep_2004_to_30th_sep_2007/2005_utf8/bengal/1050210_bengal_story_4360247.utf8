 Ghisingh poll threat cloud on CPM meet

 BARUN GHOSH 

 Calcutta, Feb. 9: Insiders believe Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council chief Subash Ghisingh?s threat against polls to the body is looming on the CPM?s state conference that began today at Kamarhati in North 24-Parganas. 

 ?The uncertainty over the impending polls in Darjeeling is of utmost concern to us after Ghisingh refused to participate in the ensuing polls to the hill council,? said a key CPM functionary. 

 The three-day conference affords party functionaries a chance to discuss and chalk out organisational strategy for the next three years. 

 Though a meeting between Ghisingh and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee began yesterday on a warm note, Ghisingh left in a huff midway, saying his party would not participate in the polls ?till problems of the council? were sorted out. 

 Jyoti Basu was ?disturbed? over Ghisingh?s sudden ?turnaround?. ?I don?t know what will happen if Ghisingh refuses to participate in the poll process. We still hope good sense will prevail on him so that elections are held peacefully in the hills,? said the CPM veteran. 

 The DGHC was formed during Basu?s tenure as chief minister following a tripartite accord among representatives from the Centre, the state government and the GNLF in August 1988. 

 Over a dozen delegates from Darjeeling, led by CPM district secretary S.P. Lepcha, at the conference fear violence would revisit the hills if elections are not held as scheduled. Lepcha is believed to have requested the chief minister to brief the party?s hill leaders on his meeting with Ghisingh.

 Bhattacharjee, who also oversees party affairs in the hills, is expected to meet the delegates on Friday. 

 The government is also in a fix on its course of action if the polls are postponed. Hill affairs officials met to discuss their options, including extending the council?s term or appointing an administrator, both of which will need amendments to the Darjeeling Gorkha (Autonomous) Hill Council Act.

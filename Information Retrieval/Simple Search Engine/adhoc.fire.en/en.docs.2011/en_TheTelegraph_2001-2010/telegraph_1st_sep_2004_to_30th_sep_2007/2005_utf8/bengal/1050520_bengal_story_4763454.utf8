 Media role in bandh case

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 19: Calcutta High Court today asked petitioner Idris Ali to make newspapers parties in a contempt case filed against Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee for allegedly making comments supporting a bandh even after the court had declared it illegal.

 A bench of Justices Pratap Kumar Roy and Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya took this decision after Kalyan Banerjee, a Trinamul MLA and Mamatas advocate, said his client did not receive any contempt notice from the court.

 Sreemoyee Mitra, the lawyer appearing for the petitioner, said Trinamul had called a state-wide bandh on December 3 and the high court had on November 30 declared it illegal.

 On December 3, Mamata Banerjee told the press that she would observe more bandhs for the peoples cause. The leader also announced she would not mind going to jail for calling bandhs, said Mitra.

 The petitioners lawyer said the major newspapers of the city had carried the Trinamul chairpersons statement in their next editions. From newspaper reports it is clear that Mamata Banerjee had made the comments, argued Mitra.

 Banerjee opposed Mitras plea and tried to convince the court that judges should not take any decision on the basis of newspaper reports.

 Let the newspapers concerned come before the court and file affidavits, the judges then observed and fixed June 24 as the next day for hearing.

 During November and December, the CPI(ML), SUCI and Trinamul called separate bandhs against a hike in petrol and diesel prices. Ali moved three separate petitions in the high court to challenge the legality of bandhs.

 The court had observed that, as the Supreme Court had declared bandhs illegal, the statewide bandhs called in Bengal were illegal.

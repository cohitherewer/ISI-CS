 Dues protest to greet Suri at Great Eastern 

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Nov. 25: The government today said it will be able to clear the dues of the over 400 Great Eastern Hotel emp- loyees only by December 15, though it will be officially declared closed on November 30.

 But state Intuc chief Subrata Mukherjee threatened an agitation in front of the hotels entrance from Tuesday, Nov- ember 29. That day, Lalit Suri, whose Bharat Hotels will take over Great Eastern, is scheduled to visit the hotel. 

 Mukherjee, along with the general secretary of the Great Eastern Hotel Staff Association, Ramen Pande, and secretary Atiar Rahaman, called on industries and public enterprise minister Nirupam Sen at Writers Buildings today to lodge a protest against the delay.

 If the government decides to close down the hotel on November 30, all the early retirement scheme (ERS) dues will have to be paid by then. We want the government to make an additional payment in case of any delay. We dont have any grievances. We only want the employees dues, he said after the meeting.

 Tourism secretary Tapan Barman, however, said the governments official deadline for clearing the dues was December 15. On November 30, the Great Eastern Hotel Authority will formally accept the ERS applications. The government is bound to pay the dues within 15 days of that date. So, technically, our deadline is December 15, he said. 

 Mukherjee, however, warned that the employees would stage a dharna at the hotels entrance to prevent Suri from getting in if the dues were not paid by then. We will go for a more intensive movement if force is applied on the employees, he added.

 Suri clinched the deal in mid-November with an offer of Rs 52 crore for the 90 per cent stake and another Rs 120 crore for the hotels renovation. According to plan, Great Eastern would retain its 165-year-old fa?ade but would undergo a makeover inside. 

 It will be extremely embarrassing for us if Suri is greeted by angry demonstrations when he comes here on November 29, said hotel member secretary and chief executive Jagannath Bag. 

 Mukherjee said he would stick to his demand. The minister has sought 10-15 days to clear all the dues. But we have made it clear that we cannot wait.

 BRIEFS

 Behrampore, June 6: A youth hacked his 60-year-old aunt to death at a village in Sagardighi last evening after accusing her of witchcraft. 

 Gobinda Murmu and his father Ram have been arrested for killing Lakshmi Murmu at Kumodda village, about 240 km from Calcutta. Murshidabad police chief Sanjay Singh said the father and son suspected Lakshmi to be a witch and held her responsible for the death of Antani, Rams 12-year-old daughter, three weeks ago. Antani, the police said, died of heat stroke on May 17 after working in a field for hours. She had pain in the chest and breathing problems, an officer said. But two relatives apparently convinced Ram that Lakshmi was responsible for the death. Last evening, the father and the son called her out of her hut. As she stepped out, Gobinda attacked her with an axe. 

 Krishnagar: About 20 additional public prosecutors and public pleaders of five Nadia courts went on a strike from Monday demanding payment of dues of over five ears. They claimed that the government owed them about Rs 1 crore.

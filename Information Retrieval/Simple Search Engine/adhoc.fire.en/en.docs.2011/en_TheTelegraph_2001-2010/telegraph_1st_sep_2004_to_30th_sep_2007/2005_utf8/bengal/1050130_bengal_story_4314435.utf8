 Call for mahajot 

 Jan. 29: Congress leader Priya Ranjan Das Munshi today called for another attempt at stitching together a grand alliance of anti-CPM forces before the 2006 elections.

 ?I want Mamata (Banerjee) and similar other anti-CPM forces to form a mahajot to ensure the CPM?s defeat in the coming Assembly polls,? he told a rally in Durgapur. 

 ?Other parties carrying Left banners are not safe in the CPM?s regime and they are welcome to our anti-CPM front,? he added. 

 Adhir Chowdhury, the Murshidabad Congress chief, was present but former PCC chief Somen Mitra and Congress legislature party leader Atish Sinha stayed away. 

 Trinamul defection

 About a dozen Trinamul Congress councillors of the Bolpur municipality led by former MLA Sushovan Bandopadhyay will re-join the Congress on January 31.

 Parties set sights on hung councils

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, May 26: A day after the announcement of the municipal poll results, parties today began exercises to improve their tallies by breaking the deadlock in 15 hung municipalities.

 Be it the ruling Left Front or Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress or the Congress, all initiated measures to gain control of the hung municipalities though their leaders downplayed such efforts.

 A measure of the parties approach was first provided by state CPM secretary Anil Biswas, who said that apart from gaining a clear majority in 49 municipalities, the Left Front was in a position to form boards in three more with the help of Independents.

 The Trinamul has so far tried to survive with the BJPs help. Now the party is trying to ensure its political existence with the Congresss cooperation. The Congress, too, is trying to protect the Trinamul, Biswas said.

 He claimed the Congress, Trinamul and the BJP had forged an unofficial mahajot or grand alliance in several wards but their efforts went waste.

 Both the Congress and the Trinamul today kept their options open about forging a post-poll alliance to capture the 15 hung municipal boards. 

 The fate of the Beldanga and Basirhat municipalities will be decided through lottery as the ruling Left Front and the Opposition parties have won an equal number of seats.

 Trinamul chairperson Mamata Banerjee said: We are not in a hurry to take a decision about the hung municipalities. Let us wait for the official notification on board formation. We are keeping a close watch on the situation, she said.

 Leaders of the Congress and the Trinamul held a series of meetings in their respective camps to review the election results and finalise strategies to capture the hung municipal boards.

 The poll outcome in at least 13 municipalities, however, indicates that neither the Congress nor the Trinamul will be able to capture the boards without formally joining hands in a post-election mahajot.

 Otherwise, the Left Front will be in a position to rule the civic bodies by virtue of achieving single majority.

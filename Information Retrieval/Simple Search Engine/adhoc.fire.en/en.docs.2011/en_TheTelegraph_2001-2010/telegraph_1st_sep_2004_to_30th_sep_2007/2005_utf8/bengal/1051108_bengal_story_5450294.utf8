 Collars to track Sunderbans tigers

 Calcutta, Nov. 7: Royal Bengal tigers in the Sunderbans will soon have radio collars around their necks and their pug marks will be analysed on computer.

 The exercise is slated to be over before the next census, due in January. The last census had put the Sunderbans tiger tally at 280.

 The collars will help experts know about the exact surrounding of individual tigers as well as other information like what kind of food is available in their habitat. 

 They will also aid in keeping tabs on the number of big cats roaming the reserve. 

 A.K. Raha, the chief conservator of forest and director of the Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve, said four tigers would be initially selected from the core area, which is deep in the forests, and the sanctuary and buffer areas ? between the reserve and human habitat ? as these places have varied vegetation.

 After being captured, the tigers will be given tranquillisers. Then the radio collars will be put round their necks. The entire exercise is expected to take over two hours.

 The Dehradun Wild Life Institute will procure the collars from the US. They would cost around Rs 1.5 lakh each. 

 The tracking, Raha said, would help foresters learn more about the habits of the animal and protect their habitats.

 Instead of the conventional microscopic analysis of pug marks, computers will be used for the tiger census. The earlier system was not foolproof as it was difficult to ascertain whether it was the print of a tiger paw or of any other animal. The computer analysis will bring more accuracy as well as transparency to the process, Raha said.

 He said the pug marks will be sent to the Indian Statistical Institute in Baranagar for examination. On the basis of its findings, we can determine the actual number of tigers in the Sunderbans.

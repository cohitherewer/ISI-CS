 Somen salve on Adhir 

 OUR BUREAU 

 Chowdhury: Not blinking

 Jan. 19: Senior state Congress leader Somen Mitra today stepped in to placate Behrampore MP Adhir Chowdhury and requested him to withdraw his resignation as Murshidabad Congress chief. 

 On January 11, Chowdhury took a dig at Mitra and his associates, blaming them for growing rifts in the party, at a rally addressed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 

 ?We may have differences among ourselves but Adhir?s resignation will send out wrong signals to the ruling CPM to campaign against us. I have already asked Adhir to withdraw the resignation,? Mitra said tonight.

 Leader Pradip Bhattacharya said state Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee might call on the MP during his visit to Behrampore tomorrow. ?We are confident Pranabda will prevail on Adhir to revoke the resignation,? he added. 

 But Chowdhury, camping in Behrampore, ruled out withdrawing his resignation. ?I shall continue to work as a Congress worker. There are other Congress leaders who can take over as district Congress president,? he said. 

 Sources said Chowdhury quit to protest against a few PCC leaders? support to his rival and Kandi MLA Atish Sinha. 

 ?Adhir was hurt after Pranabda blamed him for the prevailing mess within the party due to his strained relations with Sinha. He asked both of them to stop mud-slinging at a meeting in Calcutta last week,? said a PCC leader. 

 Murshidabad zilla parishad sabhadhipati Siddiqua Begum and 10 other members today sent an SOS to Mukherjee that they would resign en masse if Chowdhury did not withdraw the resignation. Behrampore municipality members also said they would stage a dharna to put pressure on Chowdhury.

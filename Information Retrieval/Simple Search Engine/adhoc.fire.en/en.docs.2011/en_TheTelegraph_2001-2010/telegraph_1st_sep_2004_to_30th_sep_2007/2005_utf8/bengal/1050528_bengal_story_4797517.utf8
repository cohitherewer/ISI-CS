 Hello calls choke helpline

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, May 27: Polices efforts to turn friends might come a cropper in Nadia because of pranksters.

 Over 60 per cent of the calls on the dial-100 helpline are hoax, said the district police authorities. Many a times, its children calling up to say hello. 

 Last week, when the phone rang at the Kotwali police station here, about 80 km from Calcutta, an officer picked up. 

 A childs voice chirped: Hi, you are a policeman? What are you doing? The officer asked him not to make such a call again and put down the receiver, but the phone rang and the same boy asked the same questions again.

 Not that the policemen mind it always, but they fear that other serious callers might find the line busy and hang up. 

 Last week, a caller said four people had been killed in a jeep crash at Nakashipara. The police reached the spot to realise that it was a false alarm. 

 A month ago, a man called up the Tehatta police station and informed about a gruesome murder. 

 On reaching the remote village, we realised that we had been taken for a ride, said additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh. 

 A caller line identifier was installed last month and 20 people were picked up and set free after a sermon. Five children also received the lesson. 

 Ghosh said the people must understand that the hoax calls might spell their own harm.

 If any ill motive is detected, an FIR will be lodged. We are ready to help people in any kind of crisis and not just crime. But please do not mislead us, urged Ghosh.

 The silver lining is that what is common in Nadia is rare in neighbouring Murshidabad or Birbhum.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Nov. 26: The Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), a part of the paramilitary forces, today arrested two persons who had allegedly fleeced 32 youths of lakhs of rupees after promising to help them get jobs in the squad. 

 The two were picked up from Ranidanga, about 15 km from Siliguri.

 The SSB has started a recruitment drive for cooks, tailors and gardeners for its new battalions to be deployed on the Nepal border and the youths, led by R.S. Auti and Mahavir Koutikar from Maharashtra, had come to appear for the tests. 

 We found that the duo ran a centre to train youths for jobs in paramilitary forces. Apart from paying Rs 2,500 as monthly fees, the youths were told to shell out Rs 80,000 if selected, an official said.

 Protest chorus uncorked

 BARUN GHOSH

 Calcutta, Jan. 31: After the Forward Bloc, two other Left Front partners ? the RSP and the CPI ? today upped the heat on the government over its decision to issue permits for 1,000 new liquor shops. 

 Much to the chagrin of the CPM, which leads the ruling coalition, the three allies have also decided to discuss the possibility of a joint agitation.

 Sunil Sengupta, a senior RSP leader, said the party would pressure the CPM to revoke the decision. ?We have already requested them to discuss the issue at an emergency Left Front meeting. The CPM cannot unilaterally decide to allow more and more off shops.?

 Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh said: ?The time has come to voice our protest. We may be partners in the ruling coalition, but cannot accept the decision to open liquor shops to mop up revenue.? 

 Bloc leaders, Ghosh said, will soon meet CPI and RSP functionaries to launch a ?united protest?. 

 Sengupta hinted at a ?pressure group? within the front. ?The CPM?s move has to be scuttled at any cost,? he added. 

 A CPI leader said it is ?unbecoming of the Left Front? to earn revenue from liquor. ?As the principal front partner, the CPM should realise that..,? said state party secretary Manju Kumar Majumdar.

 Ironically, the tenor of protests is very similar to that by the Opposition parties.

 Jyoti Basu today said the government might review the decision. ?We have no inhibitions regarding liquor shops but, at the same time, I want the government to ensure that there is no mushrooming of such shops,? he said. 

 An excise official said: ?We advertised in dailies seeking applications for liquor licences in December, but we could not go ahead with the process because of court cases.?

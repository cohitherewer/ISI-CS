 15-year marathon for Cong

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta, Jan. 11: Out of power for 27 years, the Congress was advised by Manmohan Singh today to wait another 15 years, which could be used to convince voters of its merits.

 The Prime Minister asked party leaders to prepare a perspective plan that tells voters how the party wants to conduct itself till 2020. ?Be united. Go to the people with the plan and explain to them what you want to do in the years to come. This will help you return to power,? Singh told a modest gathering of Congress workers at Rabindra Sarobar stadium in south Calcutta.

 That the party is a split force became apparent when Behrampore MP Adhir Chowdhury held his colleagues responsible for leaving out defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi from posters and leaflets related to Singh?s visit. 

 Chowdhury added that Congress workers from Murshidabad would ?teach a lesson to the leaders from the city?. 

 The Prime Minister said his government was running strictly in accordance with the common minimum programme. The programme is backed by the CPM, among others.

 Sting operation fells ivory smuggler

 Siliguri, April 24: Bhushan Roy thought he had found the ideal buyer for his cache of ivory ? a customer who promised to buy his stock of six tusks at the price he quoted.

 Only this time, the buyer was a man in mufti.

 Roy, a dealer in animal parts, realised he had walked into a trap only after he had handed the tusks over to the officer. He had hoped to see Rs 60,000 emerge from his client?s pocket, but found himself staring into a pair of handcuffs instead. Before he could react, policemen standing by stormed into his Mallaguri residence.

 ?He knew it was the end of the road. He did not put up much of a resistance,? said Siliguri additional superintendent of police Tripurari.

 The police had been tipped-off that Roy, originally from Madhepura district of Bihar, was in possession of two pairs of tusks that had been cut to six pieces of three feet each. They also knew that he was looking for a buyer.

 Explaining their modus operandi, the officer said: ?We knew that Roy had the tusks and that he was looking for a client. He had quoted Rs 60,000 for the six pieces and we played on his greed.?

 ?Before we laid the trap, we wanted to examine the samples. We contacted Roy over phone and he sent it to us immediately. Then we sent our man to strike the deal. He was accompanied by a team of policemen who waited outside Roy?s residence,? Tripurari said.

 The police are yet to identify all the members of the gang that hunted down the two elephants from whom the tusks were taken.

 Forest officials said four pieces had come from the same elephant and two were significantly ?aged?.

 ?They were coated with a kind of paint for preservation. Animal parts dealers do that only when the tusks are pretty old,? a forest official said.

 The police have been on the traffickers? trail since the forest officials informed them that two elephants had disappeared from the Sukna range in the past few months.

 ?Roy has been living in Siliguri for the past 12 years. We are trying to ascertain how long he had been trading in animal parts,? Tripurari said.

 A senior forest department official said poaching is not rare in north Bengal and elephants, being large, are easy prey.

 Forest officials said the six-piece cache that weighed 7.9 kg would have fetched around Rs 3 lakh in the international market.

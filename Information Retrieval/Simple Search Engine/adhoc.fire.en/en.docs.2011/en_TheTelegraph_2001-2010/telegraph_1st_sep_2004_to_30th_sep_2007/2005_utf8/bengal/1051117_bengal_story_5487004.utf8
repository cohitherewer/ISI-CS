 Hundred hit by hepatitis

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Nov. 16: Nearly 100 people have been hit by hepatitis in Burdwan town over the past three weeks with reports of more cases pouring in.

 The civic authorities woke up to the crisis only yesterday and sent samples of drinking water, which they fear could be contaminated, to the Burdwan chapter of the State Water Investigation Directorate (SWID).

 Suren Mondal, the Burdwan municipality chairman who is also in charge of water supply, said he had received complaints from residents. We first have to make sure that the disease is spreading from contamination of drinking water. Let us get the report from SWID, then we will take prompt action, he said.

 The principal of Burdwan Medical College and Hospital, Bijoy Mukherjee, today urged residents to drink boiled water. Those who find it difficult can use halogen tablets to purify the water. The civic authorities should immediately super-chlorinate drinking water, he said.

 Water samples from four deep tubewells in four wards of the town have been sent for examination. 

 Civic officials said there are 34 deep tubewells across the town. We have sent water samples from the four tubewells as most of the reports of hepatitis have come from these areas. We will have the water samples tested from all the deep tubewells later, an official said.

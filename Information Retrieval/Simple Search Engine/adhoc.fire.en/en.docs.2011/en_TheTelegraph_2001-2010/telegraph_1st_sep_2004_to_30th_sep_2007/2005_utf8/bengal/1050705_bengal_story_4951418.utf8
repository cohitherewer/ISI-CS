 P amp;G officials beaten up 

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Bhubaneswar, July 4: Executives of multinational Procter amp; Gamble were beaten up by ticketless passengers when they were travelling in the Secunderabad-Howrah Falaknama Express today.

 Freeloading travellers forced their way into a reserved compartment near Balugaon station, about 90 km from Bhubaneswar, and as the companys executives protested, they were attacked while railway police allegedly stood by.

 The group of P amp;G officials reached Howrah tonight.

 Recalling the experience, Abhimanyu Ghosh, a P amp;G brand executive, said: Three of them boarded our compartment (S-9). We asked them to get down since they did not have valid tickets. But they started abusing us.

 As the train reached Khurdah Road, hundreds joined in and started beating the passengers. They singled us out and attacked us with rods and sharp weapons. We are extremely lucky to be alive, said Santosh Roy, another executive who received a head injury.

 The officials were returning from an all-India meet in Hyderabad which concluded yesterday. They boarded the train at Secunderabad this morning and were scheduled to reach Calcutta around 8.30 pm. 

 Everything was going smoothly till we reached Balugaon, a nondescript station. What horrified us was how the authorities decided to side with the attackers, said Pijush Sen Sharma. The railway policemen, who would not identify themselves, were mute witnesses and did not help us when we wanted to lodge a complaint. 

 Debasish Bhattacharya, who had a fractured left arm, narrated how he tried to flee the assault. I ran through the corridor but a few held me while others started hitting me. Two of them twisted my arm and I felt excruciating pain all over.

 The train reached Howrah at 10.45 pm, more than two hours behind schedule, railway officials said. The victims lodged a complaint with the Government Railway Police.

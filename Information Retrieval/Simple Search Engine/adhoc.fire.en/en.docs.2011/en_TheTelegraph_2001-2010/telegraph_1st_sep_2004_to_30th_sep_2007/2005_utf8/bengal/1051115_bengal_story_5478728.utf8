 Ally teachers put front in dock for laxity

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 14: Teachers of state-run Madhyamik and higher secondary schools belonging to a CPM-controlled association are on a collision course with the government.

 The teachers feel that the government has failed to adopt a comprehensive policy to help state-run schools across Bengal, though many of these institutions impart a high standard of education and are sought after by middle- and upper middle-class parents.

 Our government has done nothing for these schools which are directly run by the school education department, said Bishnu Roy, general secretary of the West Bengal Government School Teachers Association, one of the most powerful teachers bodies in the state.

 This association is as close to the ruling party as the All Bengal Teachers Association, the CPM-controlled organisation of teachers of state-aided secondary schools.

 Announcing a decision to launch an agitation against the government from today, Roy said: We are holding meetings, processions and demonstrations in front of district magistrates offices till December 7. We will have to intensify our movement and take steps like boycotting classes if we find the government not responding.

 About 900 teachers are expected to join the protest.

 We wonder why the government is not keen on maintaining academic standards in these schools, which it had identified as model institutions. What examples are we setting to private schools? Roy asked.

 Topping the list of the teachers grievances, which they say have crippled the functioning of these institutions, is an acute shortage of teachers in most of the 44 schools.

 Scarcity of teachers has reached such an alarming stage that most of the schools are on the verge of closure, said Roy.

 Around 400 out of 1,300 teaching posts are vacant.

 School education minister Kanti Biswas admitted the shortage and said the government was taking steps to tackle the problem.

 The teachers referred to a recent decision by headmasters of several government-run schools in Calcutta and the districts to declare an extra days holiday and follow a four-day-week schedule as they do not have adequate number of teachers. 

 The teachers claim that despite such problems, the performance of most of these schools is high and at least half a dozen students from these institutions figure on the Madhyamik and higher secondary merit lists.

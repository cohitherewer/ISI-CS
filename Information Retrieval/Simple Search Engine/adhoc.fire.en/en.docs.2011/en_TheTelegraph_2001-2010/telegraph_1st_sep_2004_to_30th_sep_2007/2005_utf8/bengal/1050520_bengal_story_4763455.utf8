 Pranab to punish attackers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jiagunj (Murshidabad), May 19: Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee today said those found guilty of assaulting him at a party office in Calcutta on Sunday would be severely punished.

 I myself and no one else will conduct the inquiry and punish those party workers found guilty, Mukherjee said while campaigning here, 230 km from Calcutta. The defence minister spent the day in Murshidabad district soliciting votes for party candidates contesting the May 22 municipal elections.

 Let me hold the inquiry first and then I will myself punish the errant party workers, Mukherjee said. Congress circles are abuzz with talk that followers of either Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi or former state party chief Somen Mitra are behind the assault.

 Mukherjee arrived this morning in Murshidabad, where the Congress is sharply divided. The district Congress president and party MP, Adhir Chowdhury, has fielded Independents in the 17-seat Kandi municipality against supporters of the local MLA and Congress legislature party leader, Atish Sinha, who are contesting on the partys symbol.

 The state party chief decided not campaign in Kandi to steer clear of controversy.

 The Union minister campaigned in Murshidabad, Jiagunj-Azimgunj and Jangipur municipal areas. These, as well as the Beldanga, Dhuliyan and Kandi municipalities, will go to polls on May 22.

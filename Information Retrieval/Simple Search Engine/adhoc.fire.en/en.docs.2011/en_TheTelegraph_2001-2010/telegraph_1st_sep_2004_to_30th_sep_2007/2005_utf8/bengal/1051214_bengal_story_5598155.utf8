 Boys have fun at mothers expense

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE

 Durgapur, Dec. 13: Fifteen years ago, Rajlakshmi Dutta had turned down the offer of a job at Alloy Steel Plant after her husbands death and requested the authorities to give it to her eldest son instead.

 Now, at 65, she is unwelcome in her own two-storey house at Benachity in the heart of Durgapur town, 220 km from Calcutta. 

 Rajlakshmis four sons, all well established, have allotted a dingy ground-floor room to her. She is only allowed to spend the night there. 

 The power line to the room has been disconnected.

 Rajlakshmi roams the neighbourhood during the day and begs for food. Her sons receive rent from tenants who occupy a portion of their house and a market complex nearby that their father had inherited. 

 The widow had approached the subdivisional judicial magistrates court last year with the help of a lawyer neighbour, demanding maintenance, a share of the rents and right to stay in her house with dignity. 

 She lodged a separate case in the court of the executive magistrate this year alleging that she was being tortured. 

 The executive magistrate asked police to conduct a probe. The inquiry report, submitted to the court this month, corroborated her story, said Manoj Kanti Roy, her neighbour and counsel. 

 Rajlakshmis husband Sukhomoy, a technician at the plant, died of cancer at the age of 54. 

 Pradip, who had got the job of a trainee technician then, earns about Rs 8,000 a month now. His brothers are Dipak, a supplier to industrial units, Mukti, who has a sweetmeat manufacturing business, and Shanti, who lives on his share of the rent.

 My mother is a mental patient, said Pradip. We are ready to accept her responsibility, but we cannot pay her more than Rs 500 a month, he added.

 Rajlakshmi said: I never thought they could do this. 

 The court had ordered the sons to give her Rs 1,500 a month as maintenance, which they paid only for a few months. My client has now sought a partition of the property, Roy said. 

 He is fighting Rajlakshmis case free of cost.

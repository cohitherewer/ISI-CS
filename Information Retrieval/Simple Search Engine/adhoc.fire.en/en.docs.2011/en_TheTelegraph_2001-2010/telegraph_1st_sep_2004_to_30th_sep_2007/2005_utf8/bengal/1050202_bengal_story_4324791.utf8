 Pull out, Mamata tells CPM 

 Calcutta, Feb. 1: Mamata Banerjee today blamed the CPM for the Centre?s decision to allow provident and pension funds to invest a fraction of their money in shares.

 ?I feel the CPM, which is backing the Congress government at the Centre, is equally responsible for the dangerous decision. The earlier NDA government had never thought of such an anti-people measure,? Mamata told reporters at her south Calcutta home.

 Asked about the CPM?s criticism of the decision, the Trinamul Congress chief reacted angrily. ?If they are serious about the social security of workers, they should withdraw support. Otherwise, the protest is just an eyewash,? she said. Her supporters, Mamata warned, would take to the streets to pressure the Centre. 

 She also slammed the state?s liquor policy. ?The CPM has failed to provide jobs, but is indiscriminately issuing liquor licences. This is a heinous attempt to cripple our youths and schoolchildren.?

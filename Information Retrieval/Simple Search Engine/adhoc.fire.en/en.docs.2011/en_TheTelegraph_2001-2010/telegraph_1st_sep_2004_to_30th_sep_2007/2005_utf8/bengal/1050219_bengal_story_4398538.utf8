 CPM sights on grassroots

 ANUPAM DASGUPTA

 Siliguri, Feb. 18: The CPM today decided to go to the grassroots as part of a long-term ploy to counter Subash Ghisingh?s ?separatist brand of politics?. 

 With the stalemate over the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) continuing even after two tripartite meetings in Delhi, the last held yesterday, party elders here racked their brains at a special meeting to decide on the course of action regarding the hill council election. The poll has to be held before the term of the current board expires on March 25. 

 Senior party leaders, who reviewed the recent political developments, said it was time to drive home the ?futility? of Ghisingh?s propaganda to the people of the hills. 

 Ghisingh has said that the DGHC election was not possible until the council was constitutionally recognised and given more administrative powers. 

 Two one-to-one sessions with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee also failed to convince the GNLF chief to hold the election that is long due.

 ?Time is ripe for the party to shun short-term tactical measures to counter Ghisingh and, instead, focus on a long-term objective. The political future of the hills is at stake. The GNLF chief is confusing people with his rhetoric and misleading them with false information,? urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya told The Telegraph.

 ?He cannot ignore democratic norms since he does not have a popular mandate to head the hill council in its present form. We ask the people to shun such false rhetoric,? he added. 

 Asked how the CPM planned to counter the green army in the hills, Darjeeling CPM secretary S.P. Lepcha said there was no alternative but ?to go all-out against the GNLF and its supreme leader?. 

 Party insiders said the CPM planned to take the issues to grassroots, especially since a recent survey by the party has revealed that a section of the hill people had become ?disenchanted? with the GNLF?s variety of politics. 

 The CPM leaders are expected to meet their opposition People?s Democratic Front counterparts in Darjeeling on Sunday to draw up a ?common minimum programme? on the hill council poll.

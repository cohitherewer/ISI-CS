 Liquor law

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 1: The state government has amended its excise rules and decided to issue licences for Indian-made foreign liquor in 72 tribal areas.

 The government had not allowed foreign liquor shops in tribal areas as it would have affected country liquor sales.

 The amendment was announced in Calcutta High Court yesterday by additional government pleader Debasish Kar Gupta during the hearing on a public interest litigation challenging the validity of a notification by the collector and superintendent of the excise department inviting applications for opening foreign liquor shops in tribal areas.

 Rabin Tudu, a resident of Sarangi village in Bankura district, had pointed out in the petition that the Excise Act, 1993, prevents the government from issuing licences for opening such shops in tribal areas.

 When the matter came up for hearing again, the pleader informed the court that the government had amended the Excise Act and licences could be issued in tribal areas that are gram panchayat headquarters or have police stations.

 Calcutta, May 31: Hours after the Madhyamik results were announced top institutions across the city offering higher secondary courses were in the middle of a hectic routine ? chalking out measures to cope with the rush of admission seekers from tomorrow.

 Most schools called special meetings of their academic councils immediately after the results were declared. 

 ?Our students have performed brilliantly and we are sorry that we had to set a high cut-off percentage for both external as well as our own students,? said Krishna Damani, a spokesperson for South Point High School.

 Others like Gokhale Memorial, Holy Child, Hindu, Hare and St Lawrence have also decided to set ?high cut-off marks? for admission to Class XI.

 Allies pressure govt to talk to rebels 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 18: If the government had no problem talking to Subash Ghisingh to stem violence in the hills, it should not have a problem doing the same with the Naxalites, some of the Left Front constituents said today.

 Forward Blocs Ashok Ghosh, the CPIs Manju Kumar Majumdar and Kshiti Goswami of the RSP pressed the government to take the dialogue route which, they said, helped contain the violence unleashed in the Darjeeling hills by the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) leader over a decade ago.

 What is wrong in talking to the Maoists if seen in view of our experience of talks with the GNLF in the 1980s? Were they any less violent? asked Ghosh, the Bloc state secretary. 

 We do not feel that mere police action can tackle the Maoists. They are a political outfit with an ideology. So, we should not hesitate if they agree to come to a negotiation table to discuss their problems with an open mind without any conditions.

 Before last years Lok Sabha elections, the CPM jointly campaigned with the Congress, which is in favour of the Telengana movement in Andhra Pradesh, Ghosh said.

 If the Andhra Pradesh government could initiate dialogue with representatives of the Peoples War, why should we not do so with the Maoists? asked Majumdar, the CPI state secretary. 

 He also urged the government to ensure that police do not commit excesses during their drive against the rebels.

 Goswami said there should be a consensus on the approach to the problem. Instead of police action, we should fight the Maoists politically.

 However, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas today iterated that talks with the Maoists could not be initiated till they gave up violence. 

 On Saturday, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had expressed the same view.

 Observers said the CPMs difference of opinion with its minor partners has confused leaders at the grassroots. 

 Many of them believe that there has been no concerted effort by the party and its partners to fight the rebels, which is one of the reasons for their spread across south Bengal.

 The partners also demanded a meeting to discuss issues cropping up in the wake of the Maoist attacks in Bankura and Purulia last Saturday in which three CPM leaders and a police officer were killed. 

 A senior police officer said a joint crackdown was being planned with the Jharkhand force on extremists hiding in the jungles there.

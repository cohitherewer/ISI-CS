 Mamata to go it alone

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Contai, Jan. 22: Mamata Banerjee today said the Trinamul Congress will fight the forthcoming elections to Calcutta Municipal Corporation and 22 other municipalities, slated for June, independently.

 However, Mamata did not specify whether she would part with the BJP for ever. ?The issue will be discussed at an upcoming National Democratic Alliance meeting in New Delhi,? she said.

 The Trinamul leader ruled out any electoral alliance with the Congress for the municipal polls and next year?s Assembly elections. ?There is no question of any electoral tie-up with the Congress as long as the party takes support from the CPM,?? Mamata said at the party?s two-day national convention that began at Aurobinda Stadium here today.

 Nearly 3,000 delegates, including MLAs and party councillors, attended the session. A few delegates also came from Jharkhand and Bihar.

 The Trinamul chief said later at a press conference that she had blundered by tying up with the Congress for the 2001 Assembly elections. ?The Congress, which has formed the government at the Centre with the support of the CPM, cannot fight the communists here. So, I want those opposed to the communists to join forces with us to ensure the collapse of the CPM?s regime in Bengal,? she said.

 ?A friend in Delhi cannot be an enemy in Bengal. This is nothing but hypocrisy. We don?t believe in such an ideology,? she said.

 Mamata said her party would prepare an alternative economic policy to counter that of the ruling CPM. ?We have formed a committee, headed by the party MLA Saugata Roy, to prepare an alternative economic policy within a month. We will go to the public with the new policy, which will save the Bengal from bankruptcy,?? she said.

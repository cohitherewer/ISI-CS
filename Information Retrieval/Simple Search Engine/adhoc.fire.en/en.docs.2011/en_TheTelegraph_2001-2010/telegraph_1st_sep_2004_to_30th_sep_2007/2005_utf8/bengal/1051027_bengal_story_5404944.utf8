 Pension hike for dead MLA

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bolpur, Oct. 26: Ashok 

 Sarkar was in for a shock when the postman dropped a letter 

 at his Bolpur School Bagan residence this morning.

 Addressed to his father Amarendra Nath Sarkar, a former Congress MLA, who died in 1989, the letter from the principal secretary of West Bengal Legislative Assembly offered a hike in his monthly pension from Rs 200 to Rs 1,500.

 It also mentioned the specific section of the government act under which the decision to increase the pension was made.

 Amarendra was well-known in the locality not only as an MLA but also as a devoted freedom fighter. He was the first chairman of Bolpur municipality.

 A retired employee of a private company, Ashok was puzzled on receiving the letter. How could the government write such a letter? he asked. It was the same government which had sent a condolence message to my mother Rina Devi after my father breathed his last on August 2, 1989.

 I am quite confused and cannot make out the meaning of this letter because I had personally informed the treasury office and the bank through which my fathers (pension) payment used to be disbursed. After this, his MLA pension was stopped.

 After Amarendra passed away, his widow Rina Devi received Rs 500 per month as widow pension for two years till her death on the grounds that her husband had spent 10 years behind bars during the freedom movement.

 But this (sending the letter) has brought back many memories of my father. I will soon write to the government to rectify the mistake, Ashok said.

 Module makeover on CU menu

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 27: After 

 carving up the undergraduate degree courses into three parts, 

 Calcutta University is in the mood for some more change.

 Authorities today said the university wants to rework all undergraduate syllabi into modules, following in the footsteps of premier varsities like JNU in Delhi, institutions in Pune, Mumbai and Chennai and Bengals own Jadavpur University.

 The syllabi will be divided into modules based on themes. The module pattern is the most scientific approach to imparting education at the undergraduate level in the modern education system, said Suranjan Das, the universitys pro-vice chancellor, academic affairs. 

 Even though the system is being practised by most premier institutions in India as well as abroad, it is completely new for Calcutta University. We will be in a position to implement the decision after discussing with people across the academic circle and students, he added.

 Under the proposed system, Das said, every module would be based on a particular theme or subject. For instance, art and architecture currently figure in different history papers. Now they will be combined into a module.

 Similarly, feudalism is found in subjects like history, political science and economics. So everything about feudalism ?- from the point of view of history, political science and economics ? can be rolled into one module. If a student studies that particular module, he will have a comprehensive knowledge about feudalism, a varsity official said.

 This will not only help the students but also make the teaching process more scientific and easier, he added. 

 P.N. Ghosh, the dean of the science faculty, who is involved in framing the new pattern, said another advantage is that the modules would be open to students of all disciplines. For instance, students who opt for mathematics as specialised subject can have a module related to humanities or commerce.

 The proposal was placed at the meeting of the universitys syndicate recently where the members accepted it in principle. The West Bengal Council of Higher Education has also given its nod.

 The CU syndicate has asked departments to examine the proposal and see if it would be feasible considering the large number of students involved. More than three lakh examinees from nearly 150 colleges take the universitys undergraduate examinations every year.

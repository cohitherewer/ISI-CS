 Mothers milk means more IQ

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 30: If a child has poor IQ, dont blame it on fate or lack of effort. Paediatricians say inadequate breastfeeding is taking a toll on childrens intellect.

 Only 30 per cent of mothers in the city follow the six-month breastfeeding routine and if the number does not increase, childrens IQ levels will continue to dip, paediatricians have cautioned. 

 Unless fed adequate mothers milk, a developmental co-ordination disorder arises in school-going children, causing difficulties in learning, behaviour and psychosocial adjustment that persist even in adulthood.

 The situation has become so grave that the Indian Academy of Paediatrics (IAP) has appealed to the government to increase the maternity leave of working women from three months to six.

 We have submitted a proposal to the government in this regard because a working woman can never breastfeed her child for six months in a row, said Apurba Ghosh, the director of the Institute of Child Health and a senior IAP functionary. 

 A child in order to have adequate brain development must be given breast milk which is rich in omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids, an essential nutrient for the development of a childs brain, he added. 

 Most women, especially those working outside their homes, are reluctant to breastfeed their children. Out of 100 new mothers who come to me with their children everyday, only 30 regularly breastfeed their children, said paediatrician B.K. Monocha.

 A recent survey conducted by Oxford University also underlines the importance of giving children a diet rich in omega 3 and omega 6 fatty acids.

 Experts say the maximum brain growth and development in children occurs by the age of five.

 Essential fatty acids that are found in milk are also known as DHA (decosahexaenoic acid) which helps mature the nervous system, develop better hand-eye coordination and improve IQ levels, said Ghosh.

 Apart from milk, fatty acids are found in oil-rich fish.

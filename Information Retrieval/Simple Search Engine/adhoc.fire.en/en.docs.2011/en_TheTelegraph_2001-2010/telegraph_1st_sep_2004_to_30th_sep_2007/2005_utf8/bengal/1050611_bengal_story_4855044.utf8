 June 13 deadline for state elections 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 10: The Assembly polls in Bengal will be completed by June 13 next year, chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon said today.

 The Election Commission, he added, has already started its exercise for the polls in Bengal, Kerala, Assam, Tamil Nadu and the Union territory of Pondicherry.

 Asked about the possibility of early polls in the state, Tandon said: The commission has the constitutional mandate to hold elections and constitute the new House before June 13. We are working on that. 

 For the first time in the state, electoral rolls will have voters photographs ? in 35 polling booths in Cooch Behar, Nadia and West Midnapore. We have chosen these three districts because (the) coverage of photo-identity cards there is maximum, the poll panel chief said. 

 Tandon also said that in about a month, mobile phone owners would be able to check their particulars on the voters list through SMS. I am told there are about 30 lakh mobile phone users in Bengal. All the mobile phone owner has to do is send an SMS by punching in his photo-identity card number and press the call button. He will get the answer to his query? We are working it (the scheme) out with different service providers and it is in the final stage, he added.

 The mainline political parties in the state met Tandon today. He also had a separate meeting with chief secretary Asok Gupta, home secretary A.K. Deb and director-general of police S.C. Avasthy.

 Asked if the special election observer had, in his report, described the Lok Sabha polls in Bengal as a farce, Tandon said: We take note of all reports... there were three other observers also.

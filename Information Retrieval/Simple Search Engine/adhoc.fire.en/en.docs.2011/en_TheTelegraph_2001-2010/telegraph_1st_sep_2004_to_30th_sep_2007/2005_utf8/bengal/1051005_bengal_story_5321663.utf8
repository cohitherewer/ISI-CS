 Minister seeks bail over riot

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 4: Narayan Biswas, the minister of state for cottage and small-scale industries, has filed an anticipatory bail prayer before the high court apprehending arrest for alleged rioting in 1988.

 The minister has been charged with being part of a gang that set 22 Congress supporters houses ablaze in Gangarampur of South Dinajpur.

 An FIR was lodged the next day against 89 people, including Biswas, then a CPM district committee member. 

 A district judge had rejected Biswass anticipatory bail plea then. An arrest warrant was also issued, but he did not bother to appear in court and the case remained pending.

 The high court division bench of Justices A.K. Talukdar and S.P. Talukdar will hear the ministers anticipatory bail plea in a couple of days.

 The minister, in his petition, has suppressed the fact that his anticipatory bail prayer was rejected by the district judge in 1988. The then Balurghat subdivisional judicial magistrate had issued the arrest warrant against him, said Arunava Ghosh, the counsel for the victims. 

 The district judge had said the case could not be completed because Biswas avoided the court, Ghosh alleged.

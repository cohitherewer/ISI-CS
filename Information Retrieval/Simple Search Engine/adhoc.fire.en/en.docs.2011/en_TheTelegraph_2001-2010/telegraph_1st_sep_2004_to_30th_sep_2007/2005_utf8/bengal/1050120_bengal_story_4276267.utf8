 Ghisingh demands

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Jan. 19: The government today held a meeting to review the situation in the hills before the Darjeeling Gorkha (Autonomous) Hill Council (DGHC) elections and took up the demands raised by its chief, Subash Ghisingh. 

 Chief secretary Ashok Gupta refused comment. But officials said finance secretary Samar Ghosh agreed to let the DGHC withdraw more than Rs 2 crore annually from the treasury. 

 The government agreed to consider his demand for more Assembly seats in the hills, but did not entertain his call naming the hills ?tribal land?. 

 It also expressed an inability to remove the word ?autonomous? from the council as it would need an amendment to the DGHC act.

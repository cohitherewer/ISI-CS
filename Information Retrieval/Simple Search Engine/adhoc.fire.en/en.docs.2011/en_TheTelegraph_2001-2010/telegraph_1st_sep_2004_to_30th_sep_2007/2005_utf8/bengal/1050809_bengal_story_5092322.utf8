 Power vacuum shuts plant

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Aug. 8: When the government is busy wooing industries to Bengal and boasting of its power sufficiency, an entrepreneur has had to close down his pig iron plant because he did not get an electricity connection in two years.

 The management of Durgapur Metallics Ltd has said that it was unable to run the factory here because Durgapur Projects Ltd (DPL) had failed to provide the power. About 300 workers have been rendered jobless by the decision.

 The pig iron plant ? about 180 km from Calcutta ? was built on 9.5 acres provided by the Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority.

 The management alleged that DPL had promised to provide power by 2004. After a long wait, the management started production with the help of heavy-duty generators on July 9 this year.

 I had applied for the power connection from DPL when we started construction in August 2003. We informed the utility we will require 2.5 mw daily, said Kuldeep Kedia, the director of Durgapur Metallics. I have already invested Rs 20 crore on the unit, he added.

 Kedia was all the more worried because he had borrowed much of the amount from financial institutions. The company apparently lost about Rs 30 lakh because of the artificial power generation.

 Power minister Mrinal Banerjee, however, asked why the company started production without ensuring power supply. He said: I dont understand what the hurry was. Why did they start production?

 DPL managing director S.P. Dutta said: New industries would be given connection on a priority basis. But he could not explain why a new unit did not get power in two years.

 Trade park plan in taant hub

 OUR BUREAU

 March 6: Fulia, home to the famed Bengali taant saris, about 65 km from Calcutta, may get an export park-cum- commercial complex. 

 The handloom sector there, key to the economic growth of the entire Nadia district, is now mired in problems ?manufacturing to marketing. 

 The park ? to be set up at an estimated cost of Rs 2 crore ? would have modern display facilities, a centre for market information, a facility to prepare design blocks and a conference room. It would promote efforts to improve design and export by forging tie-ups with fashion houses. The hub is expected to benefit at least 20,000 local weavers directly and many more otherwise.

 A senior government official today said ?handloom means a source of valuable foreign exchange?, adding in the same breath that new ideas had to be infused, technology upgraded and designs, production techniques and processes improved to revive the ailing market for Fulia saris.

 New technologies have to be adopted, especially when there is an increasing demand for cotton hand-woven fabrics in the global market, said another official. ?The handloom sector must capitalise on this trend by focusing on the demand for Indian hand-woven textiles. The potential lies in exploiting the huge resource base of traditional skills.?

 Now, export of traditional handloom is largely neglected. ?But the market for fashion fabrics in developed countries is likely to be very receptive to the exquisitely woven material of the kind traditionally used in saris. With good marketing and design inputs and some modification in production techniques, high-value materials can be produced,? the official added. 

 Senior officials who toured Fulia last October spoke to the weavers and others associated with the trade and realised the untapped potential. District magistrate Rajesh Pandey said the weavers now lose money in the hands of middlemen. 

 The proposal to set up the export park was placed before commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen when he visited the district last month. 

 The feasibility study will begin soon and the government is looking for funds.

 Transport corp subsidy to stay

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 18: The government will continue to subsidise transport corporations, Subhas Chakraborty said today.

 Although the government is restructuring the transport department, there is no question of withdrawing subsidy from the loss-making corporations, the transport minister said. Providing subsidy to state transport corporations is an established practice all over the world. 

 The minister also pointed out that voluntary retirement schemes would be offered only to those employees of transport corporations who wished to accept them.

 The minister said the government had engaged a foreign consultant group to suggest measures for restructuring the transport department. He, however, said: We cannot implement the suggestions of the consultants in toto since it is not possible for foreign consultants to be aware of the ground realities of this state.

 Though the consultants report had suggested introducing VRS, the minister said: We will not force a single employee to accept VRS. 

 If an employee who is above 50 years of age and is unable to carry out his duties because of deteriorating health conditions, the government may request him to accept the scheme, he added.

 In a bid to justify his reservations on foreign companies preparing reports on Bengals development, Chakraborty asked: Is it possible for a foreign company official to decide on what should be the price of land in Howrah?

 He also made it clear that his department had no problem taking foreign loans. All loans are conditional. There is no reason why our department cannot accept foreign loans when the government itself is taking them, he said.

 Replying to a question by Opposition member Pankaj Banerjee on misuse of red beacon lights on vehicles, Chakraborty said strict action would be taken against unauthorised use of such lights by government officials.

 He said the government is flooded with complaints that owners of vehicles who are not entitled to use red lights are rampantly using it on their vehicles. The government has prepared a list of VIPs permitted to use beacon lights.

 According to the list, those entitled to use the red lights include the chief minister, all cabinet ministers, all ministers of state, Speaker, deputy Speaker, the chief justice of Calcutta High Court, judges of the high court and the director of fire services. Besides, beacon lights can be used on ambulances and pilot vans used by police to escort VIPs. 

 Among those who have been asked not to use beacon lights are mayors, deputy mayors, superintendents of police and district magistrates.

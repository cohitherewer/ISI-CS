 Caution to NGOs on Naxalites

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Aug. 20: Urban development and municipal affairs minister Ashok Bhattacharya today warned non-government organisations against sheltering Maoists posing as social workers.

 We know that members of bodies like the APDR and Siliguri Welfare Organisations either have Naxalite backgrounds or sympathise with Naxalite ideals, Bhattacharya said.

 We have nothing against their line of political thought. But they must not let their organisations to be used by Maoists in the garb of social workers, who are conspiring to disturb the peaceful air of Siliguri, he said. 

 The minister was speaking at a convention organised by the CPM to protest against the conspiracy to destabilise Siliguri and in support of the arrest of APDR member Debashis Chakraborty .

 The 35-year-old Chakraborty, wanted in connection with a case, was arrested at his Hyderpara office on July 29 for his alleged links with the CPI (Maoist).

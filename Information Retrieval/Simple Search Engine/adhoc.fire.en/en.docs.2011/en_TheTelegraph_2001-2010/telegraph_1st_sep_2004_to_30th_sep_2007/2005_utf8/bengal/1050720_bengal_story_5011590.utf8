 Another axe on ex-mayor

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 19: After the mayors seat, Subrata Mukherjee is set to lose another chair.

 He would have to relinquish the office of the Assemblys public accounts committee chairman.

 Today was the last date for filing nominations for election to the panel, to be held on July 26. Mukherjee did not file his papers. 

 I thought the Congress would back me. But as it has put up two of its own nominees, the question of my contesting does not arise, he said, indicating his strained relations with the party with which he had allied for the civic elections in the city. 

 The public accounts committee is one of the three elected panels in the Assembly ? the estimate committee and the committee on public undertaking being the others. Its main job is to examine the governments earnings and expenditure after consulting the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG). 

 The CPM has fielded 11 candidates for the 15 seats in the panel, making the election imminent. According to convention, legislators from the ruling party and the Opposition nominate members for the panel on the basis of an understanding. 

 In the outgoing committee, the Left Front has 10 members and the Opposition five.

 The election is inevitable this time as 16 MLAs have filed nominations for the 15 vacancies. Apparently, the CPM has flouted convention by fielding 11 candidates.

 Trinamul Congress has fielded Saugata Roy, Subrata Bakshi and Jyotirmoy Kar this time. The Congress has put Abdul Mannan and Gyan Singh Sohanpal in the fray.

 Rabin Deb, the Left Front chief whip, said the party has fielded Kanika Ganguly for the panel besides the members of the outgoing body and would approach the SUCI and the GNLF to vote for her. 

 The front is unsure of some of its votes as irrigation minister Ganesh Mandal and agriculture minister Kamal Guha are ill and power minister Mrinal Banerjee is abroad.

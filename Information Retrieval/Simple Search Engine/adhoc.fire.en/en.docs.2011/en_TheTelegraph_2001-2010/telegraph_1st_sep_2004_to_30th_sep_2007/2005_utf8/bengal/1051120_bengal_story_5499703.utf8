 CU unzips plan for 100-acre biotech park

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 19: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments plan to establish a biotechnology park in the city is set to take shape.

 Calcutta University has joined hands with the city-based Chem Gen Pharma, a biotech company, for setting up the park to promote investment and research in this field. 

 Our university has a great pool of talent in the fields of pure and bio-sciences and involvement of such top-class scientists in such areas is extremely needed for research in biotechnology. We are confident of carrying out world-class research in the proposed park if our scientists contribute. It is going to be an ideal situation of an industry-university partnership, Calcutta University vice-chancellor Asis Kumar Banerjee said, announcing the collaboration with the company.

 The university has already had a preliminary round of talks with the government and it will soon send it the formal proposal. 

 The park, a private-public partnership venture that will come up on 100 acres in Rajarhat, will house units engaged in drug discovery, bio-informatics, bio-imaging and other related areas. 

 The initial investment is not going to be less than Rs 100 crore. But we have not yet chalked out a clear plan on how to organise the funds, the vice-chancellor said. Some of it will be provided by Chem Gen Pharma. 

 Companies will set up their research and development centres and laboratories in the park and our university will provide its intellectual resources to supplement their financial resources.

 Chem Gen Pharma will work jointly with the university to set up the preliminary infrastructure. We will have to start talks with many more companies who might be interested in joining hands with us, said Anil Ghosh, its managing director.

 The universitys decision to set up the park is in tune with a policy of the state council of biotechnology, which the government had formed to find ways to develop biotech study and research and to attract investment in the sector. The council has been negotiating with various institutions in the state to explore possibilities of promoting this kind of projects with private collaborations.

 In a similar initiative, IIT Kharagpur has decided to set up a Rs 100-crore biotechnology park. The government has also received a proposal from Kalyani University and the West Bengal University of Technology to set up a similar facility at Kalyani.

 If things move in the right direction, we will start our project in six months, CU dean of science D.J. Chattopadhyay said. The laboratories will be comparable with the best in the world and we hope to attract scholars from abroad, too.

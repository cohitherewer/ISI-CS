 Presidency autonomy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 30: Presidency 

 College is likely to be the first among a set of colleges 

 in the state to achieve autonomous status.

 Officials said three more undergraduate colleges are likely to join the premier institution.

 The Centre?s Committee on Autonomy of Higher Education has recommended in a report that ?colleges which have already got A+ or A++ accreditation by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) and those which have been identified as colleges with potential for excellence by the University Grants Commission (UGC) may be granted status of an autonomous college?. 

 Presidency has been recognised as having the potential for excellence by the UGC.

 Three more colleges will also be eligible, according to sources, as the NAAC has given them A+ ratings. However, their names are being kept under wraps.

 According to the report, these institutions may be granted the status without any further inspection of their infrastructure.

 The autonomy committee was set up by the Central Advisory Board of Education (Cabe) last year to examine different aspects of autonomy in higher education across the country.

 ?We have held several rounds of meetings with teachers and important persons in the academic circle to discuss the issues related to autonomy in higher education. The final report is ready and we will be submitting it to the Cabe next month,? said state school education minister Kanti Biswas, who is also chairman of the panel.

 The report, which deals with the procedure of selecting institutions that may be granted autonomy, also mentions the process that should be followed by states for granting deemed university status to institutions. ?Colleges with A++ accreditation... running post-graduate courses and also having good research facilities could be considered for granting deemed university status,? it says.

 There are 60 ?salient recommendations? in the report divided into three sections ? academic, administrative and financial. ?Universities should have full autonomy in deciding the fee structure for different courses,? the committee says in its recommendation No. 20. 

 At the same time, it points out, ?the government mechanism for providing assistance to state-aided institutions should be such that it encourages the institutions to fix their fees at realistic levels?. The committee also calls for measures to ensure that ?there is no malpractice in setting up students? fees?.

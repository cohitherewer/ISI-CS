 Centre bashing, left amp; right

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Feb. 4: Mamata Banerjee and the CPM will kick off their protests against the central decision to increase the limit of foreign holding in telecom companies to 74 per cent on the same day, yards away from each other.

 While the CPM-led Left Front will hold a rally on Rani Rashmoni Avenue on Monday to oppose the ?anti-people measure?, Mamata?s Trinamul Congress will hold a road show opposite Metro cinema.

 Taken aback by the ?unilateral decision? by their ally in Delhi, veteran CPM leader Jyoti Basu and front chief Biman Bose slammed the Manmohan Singh government. ?Our party cannot be held responsible for an adverse consequence of this decision. 

 ?The Centre has been repeatedly violating the United Progressive Alliance?s common minimum programme. The government will not complete its five-year term even with our support, if it behaves this way,? Basu said after a state CPM secretariat meeting.

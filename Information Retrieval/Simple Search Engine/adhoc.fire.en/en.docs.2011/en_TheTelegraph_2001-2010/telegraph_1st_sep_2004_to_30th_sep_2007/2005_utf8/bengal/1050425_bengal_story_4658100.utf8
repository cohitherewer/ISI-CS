 Ally claws Subrata

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 24: Mamata Banerjee today set her party upon her former mentor, Subrata Mukherjee.

 And she got one of the mayor?s favourites to attack him in public. ?Subratada is still the mayor, so he continues to be my boss,? said Sovan Chatterjee, the mayor-in-council member in charge of water supply. ?But that does not stop one from telling the truth that Subratada has betrayed the party? he has joined hands with the CPM and the Congress.? 

 ?If truth be told, Subrata?s betrayal can only be likened to that of Mir Jafar?s,? said Kalyan Banerjee, the Trinamul MLA from Asansol. ?We must now speak out against his style of working.?

 When the Trinamul functionaries were busy slamming Mukherjee at a public meeting on B.K. Pal Avenue in north Calcutta, Mamata was seated on the dais. 

 ?We would always tell Mamata not to trust this man (Mukherjee), but she would not listen,? said one of the speakers. 

 Chatterjee alleged that the mayor had conspired with the CPM and the Congress to bring about Trinamul?s downfall in the coming polls. 

 ?Despite having grievances against him, we had so long kept silent only to serve the people better. But the time has come to speak out,? he said. 

 Banerjee was more vocal against Mukherjee, who he described as a ?backstabber?. 

 ?He was not with Trinamul when it was floated on August 1, 1998. He switched over to the party from the Congress and was made the mayor. He was even made a candidate for the Calcutta North West parliamentary seat. Now he has forgotten everything after being in power for over four years. Is this not a betrayal?? he asked. ?People would not forget such a black sheep.?

 In a brief address to the gathering, Mamata, however, did not name Mukherjee. She said she had foiled an attempt to hatch a conspiracy against the party. ?It was the CPM and the Congress?s game plan to wipe out Trinamul, the principal Opposition party, but it did not succeed ultimately. We have made them fools by not aligning with the Congress. I don?t want to repeat the mistake I had made in the 2001 elections by aligning with the Congress,? she added. 

 Mukherjee said: ?It is unfortunate that I have become Trinamul?s main adversary instead of the CPM.?

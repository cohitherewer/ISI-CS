 Investors? meet boost to N Bengal 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, April 16: An investors? meet, conceived by the Confederation of Indian Industry and the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC), appears set to be a grand affair tomorrow.

 Apart from attracting national-level players, like the Bengal Ambuja Group and Calypso Foods, the meet will see foreign representation for the first time with the Indonesia-based conglomerate, Salim Group, taking part.

 Brushing aside remarks by sceptics, urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said: ?North Bengal Calling will go a long way to lure investors to this part of Bengal. Tomorrow?s meet will be a follow-up on Destination North Bengal, held in 2003?.

 Bhattacharya said the government is appointing a consultant to study the untapped potential of the region. 

 The study will also focus on removing infrastructural bottlenecks and what needs to be done to improve the investment climate in the region. 

 It is learnt that Union commerce minister Kamal Nath has agreed to fund the study.

 However, industry insiders and a section of regional economists feel not much will come out of the event unless basic infrastructure, like telecommunication facilities, roads and power, improves.

 But Biswajit Das, the secretary of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry, north Bengal, is hopeful. 

 ?Tomorrow?s event will catapult this region as a sought-after destination for entrepreneurs and industrialists from across the country and abroad. It is also welcome news that the government is thinking of according fiscal incentives, enjoyed by northeastern states for setting up new industries,? he said.

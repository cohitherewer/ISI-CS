 Motorcycle thieves lynched

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, Oct. 2: Five alleged motorcycle thieves were killed by a mob in a North 24-Parganas village this morning. 

 Around 4 am, Sajjad, a tea-stall owner at Boira, about 40 km from Calcutta, saw Mustaq, a local goon, on a motorcycle. He stopped him to enquire about the two-wheeler, which Mustaq said was his. 

 The conversation attracted other villagers and Mustaq, faced with a volley of questions, confessed to having stolen the vehicle, said Praveen Kumar, the district police chief. 

 Sajjad then went to the local mosque and raised an alarm over the public address system there. Nearly 1,000 people surrounded Mustaq in no time. 

 As the beating began, Mustaq blurted out that four of his mates were hiding in a house nearby. 

 A dozen motorcycles have been stolen from the area in the past two months, a police officer said. 

 The four of them were dragged out and, along with Mustaq, tied with ropes and locked up in a classroom at Boira Primary School. 

 A group of about 25 men, armed with iron rods, sticks and bricks took over after that. It was all over by 6 am. 

 Finally, the five had been hacked to death. Only one of them could be identified ? Mustaq. The police, however, said all of them were associated with local crimes, primarily motorcycle thefts.

 Ten people have been arrested and a search is on for the others in the mob. 

 In Howrah, three brothers were arrested for beating to death a man at Abhoy Nagar in Bally last night. 

 D.P. Singh, the Howrah additional superintendent of police, north, said Tarun Hati, 33, was attacked by one Bhanu and his two brothers, who apparently caught him in a compromising position with Bhanus wife.

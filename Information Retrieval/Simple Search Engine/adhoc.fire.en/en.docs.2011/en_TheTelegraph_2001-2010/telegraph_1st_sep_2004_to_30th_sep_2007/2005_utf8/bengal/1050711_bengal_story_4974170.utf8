 Medicos hurt in hostel clash

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, July 10: Several medical students were injured this afternoon when groups of students from two unions clashed at the main hostel of the Medical College and Hospital (MCH) on Eden Hospital Road in central Calcutta over getting freshers into their individual folds.

 A group of students, owing allegiance to the CPMs students wing, the Students Federation of India (SFI), brought a handicapped student, among others, to the main hostel and kept him in a room. The SFI activists brought the students from the venue where counselling was being held from today.

 Members of another students union ? Medical College Democratic Students Association (MCDSA) ? alleged that the SFI was trying to force the freshers to become their members.

 According to police, the MCDSA members barged into the room to rescue the students from the hostel room. SFI members alleged that the MCDSA supporters smashed the glass plane of the windows of the hostel before throwing away mark-sheet copies and ransacking the beds.

 Soon, SFI supporters from other medical colleges gathered and the two groups clashed with rods and chains. The Bowbazar police had to intervene to control the situation.

 Later, the principal of MCH, Jayshree Mitra, was called and officer-in-charge of Bowbazar police station Gadai Dey rushed to the spot with additional enforcement. Students from both the groups were injured but no one was arrested.

 The matter was settled in a three-hour-long meeting in the presence of the college principal, the superintendent and the deputy superintendent, the hostel superintendent, and other officials.

 We have taken steps to ensure there such incidents in the hostel are not repeated, said Ajay Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police (Central).

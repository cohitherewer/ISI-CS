 No one?s woman

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, March 16: A 19-year-old mother and her infant daughter are now destitutes apparently following a shocking sequence of events triggered by a rumour.

 Three years after having married without her family?s consent, Basanti Ghosh has been disowned by both her in-laws and parents.

 Police said she was reportedly slapped by her father-in-law Sukumar Ghosh last Friday, or so the word went to her father Sadhan Ghosh, a neighbour at Bethuadahari, about 130 km from Calcutta.

 Sadhan had snapped ties with his daughter since her marriage, but could not bear the insult. He rushed to her in-laws? with his sons and some others from the neighbourhood. Sukumar and Basanti?s husband Subhas were attacked. An altercation led to a scuffle between members of the two families that ended when Subhas?s brother Byomkesh, 20, was hit on the head. He died.

 Basanti was amazed at her father?s behaviour. As a witness to the murder, she had to file an FIR naming her own father as an accused. Her husband was held on the basis of an FIR lodged by her father. 

 Both families, well-to-do farmers, held her responsible for her brother-in-law?s death and her father and husband?s arrests and made it clear they did not want her. 

 The mother and her year-old daughter, Riya, are now in a women?s home here in Nadia. Sukumar said he never slapped his daughter-in-law. ?She was solely responsible for the murder of my younger son and Subhas?s arrest. I?ll not allow her in my house again. My doors are closed,? he added.

 Additional superintendent Biswaroop Ghosh said the police arranged the accommodation for Basanti on Sunday as she was the prime witness in the case. 

 He added: ?We also wanted to keep her in safe custody because the people of the locality are blaming her for the tragedy.?

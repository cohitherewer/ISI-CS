 BRIEFS

 Midnapore, Nov. 22: The two principal accused in the Chhoto Angaria case, CPM district committee members Sukur Ali and Tapan Ghosh, today appealed for anticipatory bail in the West Midnapore district judges court here.

 The duo had arrest warrants against them for the alleged massacre of 11 Trinamul Congress supporters in January 2001.

 Krishnagar: Iman Ali Saho, a mustard oil mill owner, committed suicide on Tuesday after electricity board officials visited his house at Karimpur, about 180 km from Calcutta, and served him a Rs 3 lakh bill. Police said the owner of a two-storey house on whose ground-floor was the mill had never paid for power.

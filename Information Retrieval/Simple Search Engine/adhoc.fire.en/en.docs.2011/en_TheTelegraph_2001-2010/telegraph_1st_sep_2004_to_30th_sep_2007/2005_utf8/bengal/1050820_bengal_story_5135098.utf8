 Buddha vow on reforms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 19: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today sent a message on reforms ? to a 30-member trade delegation from Singapore ? that is in stark contrast to his partys stand.

 I guarantee that so far as West Bengal is concerned we will never block any reform, said Bhattacharjee, who attended a India-Singapore business meet organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

 Either reform or perish, replied the chief minister, when asked by a journalist from Singapore whether his government would tread the same path as the Left leaders at the Centre by blocking important economic reforms.

 The chief ministers stand seemed to satisfy members of the Singapore trade delegation, who came from different industry sectors. He is extremely pragmatic in his approach and he is bold in his stand, said a member of the trade delegation.

 Bhattacharjees stand that speeches do not result in business seemed to touch the hearts of the delegates.

 Industrialists from India should talk to their counterparts in Singapore on a one-on-one basis to facilitate business, said the chief minister, who is leaving for Singapore on a business trip on Monday. He will be accompanied by a 22-member trade delegation.

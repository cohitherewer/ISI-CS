 Dud in tests, but job still for CPM leader

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Nov. 1: The Nadia authorities today stalled the recruitment of a CPM leader in a school clerks post following complaints from other applicants that she had used her influence to get the job.

 Gita Maitra, the deputy chief of the CPM-led panchayat at Majdia, about 110 km from Calcutta, had left behind six other applicants in the race without allegedly typing a syllable or writing a word in the tests for the job.

 The applicants lodged complaints against the unfair appointment with the district inspector of schools (secondary) and the chief of the CPM-led zilla parishad, Rama Biswas. 

 Maitra is also a prominent local leader of the CPM womens wing ? the Ganatantrik Mahila Samiti. 

 In September, Shibomohini Kanya Vidyapith in Majdia invited applications for the job. The minimum qualification required was a graduate degree and typing ability of 30 words a minute. The final selection was to be on the basis of the typing ability and performance in the written test.

 There were seven applicants, including Maitra. All of them were called for the test on October 5. 

 Rina Pal, 30, a housewife from Majdia who had applied for the job, said she was surprised when she found that Maitra had been selected. We were asked to write a leave application in English and solve an arithmetic problem. All of us completed the test in the stipulated half an hour but Maitra sat idle all through, she said. 

 In the other test, we had to type out our names and addresses in two minutes. She (Maitra) could not type out a single word. I dont know how she fared in the interview.

 The inspector of schools, Subhendu Ghosh, said he has ordered a probe. The allegations are grave. I have asked a school sub-inspector to carry out an inquiry. Gita Maitras answer script will be scrutinised. Strong action will be taken against the school authorities if the allegations are proved true, said Ghosh. 

 Another applicant, 27-year-old Anupam Biswas of Taldaha, said he was definite that the CPM leader had used her clout. We know what will happen. She will not attend her job as she will remain busy with the panchayat.

 Maitra refuted the charges. The other applicants lodged the complaint against me out of jealousy as I did well in both the test and the interview, she said.

 The headmistress of the school, Bijoya Das, refused to comment. She said: The school managing committee looks after selection and recruitment of non-teaching employees. Although I am a member of the committee, I will not make a comment as a probe has already been ordered.

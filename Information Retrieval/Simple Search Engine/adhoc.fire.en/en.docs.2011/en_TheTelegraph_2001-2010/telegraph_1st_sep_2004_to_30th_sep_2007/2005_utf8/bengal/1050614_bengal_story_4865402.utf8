 Haldia half an hour away

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 13: Haldia could soon be a copter ride from Calcutta. 

 Officials from Deccan Airways met transport minister Subhas Chakraborty at Writers Buildings this afternoon and discussed the helicopter service from the city to the port town. 

 Air service between Calcutta and Haldia will drastically cut down commuting time. Travelling by road from the city to Haldia, a distance of 135 km, now takes over 3 hours. By air, it will take only 25 minutes and same-day-returns will be easy, a transport official said.

 Secretary of the department Sumantra Chowdhury said the airline would soon make a formal proposal. Haldia Development Authority chairman and local MP Laxman Seth accompanied him today during the talks with Col Sunil Bhutani, the airlines base manager.

 An airstrip will be developed on a sports department plot at Salt Lake, from where the helicopters will take off. The authority will prepare another airstrip and hanger at Haldia.

 The minister apparently asked the airline to submit its proposal as early as possible. Seth said: The airline will engage its agents to look after operations. They will provide the machinery and pilots, the government will provide infrastructure.

 Once the proposal is tabled, the government will enter into an agreement with the airline and the authority.

 Writers Buildings is confident that there will be many takers for the service.

 Foreign delegates, prospective investors and guests will be able to visit Haldia and return on the same day without hassle. We expect a good response from companies like Mitsubishi, Indian Oil Corporation, Haldia Petrochemicals and Calcutta Port Trust, an official said. The government is also hopeful that some of the industries would book season tickets for top officials and guests. 

 Apparently, there can be no better time for the launch than when the town is just looking to live up to its billing as an industry hub. 

 The service would be a blessing in cases of medical emergency, an official said.

 Earlier, the transport department had thought of letting out its helicopter, Chetak, for the service, but abandoned the idea as it was not licensed for commercial flights. Six years ago, a ground inspection was conducted and space for an air field identified on the Haldia Petrochem premises, but the project failed to take off.

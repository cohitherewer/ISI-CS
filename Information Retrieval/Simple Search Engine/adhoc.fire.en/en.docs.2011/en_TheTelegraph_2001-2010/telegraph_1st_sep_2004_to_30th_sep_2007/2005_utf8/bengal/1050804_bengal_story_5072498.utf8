 Bill tabled to privatise hotel

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Aug. 3: The table is set for the privatisation of Great Eastern Hotel. 

 State minister for tourism Dinesh Dakua placed the bill to amend the Great Eastern Hotel (Acquisition of Undertaking) Act, 1980, in the Assembly today amid protests from Opposition MLAs. However, it was passed by voice vote.

 By amending the act, we will have the authority to rejuvenate the hotel, he said. 

 The move will help the government transfer the ailing 150-year-old hotel to a partner to ensure maximum utilisation of its assets and resources. As soon as the amendment comes into force, Great Eastern Hotel Limited will be substituted for the company in the West Bengal Act of 1980.

 As Great Eastern Hotel Limited is not registered under the Companies Act, 1956, its assets and liabilities have to be transferred to a company registered under the act. The amendment will help incorporate provisions in the act that can carry forward the transfer.

 The government will shortly issue a notification so that the matter is settled at the earliest. We are closing down the hotel on September 30, said Jagannath Bag, the member secretary and chief executive of the hotel.

 The amendment had the Opposition leaders fuming. After the government took over, it has not taken any effective steps to make the hotel viable. The government had used the hotel as its guesthouse, Saugata Roy of the Trinamul Congress alleged.

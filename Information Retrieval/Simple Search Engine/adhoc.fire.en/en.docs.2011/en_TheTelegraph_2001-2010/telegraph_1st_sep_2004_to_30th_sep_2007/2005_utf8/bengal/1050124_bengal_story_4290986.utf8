 It?s snow time in Darjeeling, once again

Jan. 23: After playing hide-and-seek at Sandakphu 

and Tiger Hill over the past few days, the snow finally kept its date with Darjeeling 

town. 

 Three inches of snow wrapped the town from 11.45 am and sent the mercury dipping to 1.7 degrees Celsius below freezing. The Mall, like a melting pot to tourists and residents, looked a postcard painted in shades of white. 

 The sight of snowflakes dispelled the chill as people burst crackers in a rapturous show of joy.

 At Ravangla in south Sikkim, the celebrations began early morning. It started snowing at Menam, near Ravangla, yesterday afternoon, raising hopes of tourists in the region who came for snow. Anindya Sarkar, who came to Darjeeling from Behrampore, said: ?Can?t believe our luck... we came here several times before, but never did we see snowfall.? 

 Snow was there in the past two years as well, but that was after about a decade.

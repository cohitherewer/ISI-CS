 Green rap on civic bodies

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 30: Municipalities polluting the Hooghly by discharging sewerage without treating it have been hauled up by Calcutta High Court.

 For the first time, the green bench of the court has asked chairpersons of 19 municipalities to appear in person on June 24 to explain why they have not taken measures to introduce sewerage treatment plants.

 The decision to summon the chairpersons followed an affidavit filed by the West Bengal Pollution Control Board, which has prepared a report on the existing system of sewerage treatment in 42 civic bodies.

 In its affidavit, the board has accused the municipalities of polluting the Hooghly by discharging their waste and violating the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. 

 The bench had earlier instructed all the 42 municipalities, including the Calcutta and Howrah corporations, to file affidavits explaining the steps they had taken on setting up treatment plants. Twenty-three bodies have submitted their replies.

 In North 24-Parganas, as many as 11 municipalities have been marked for polluting the Hooghly waters ? all are located close to the river bank. In Hooghly, 10 are facing the rap.

 Gobinda Ganguly, the chairman of Kamarhati municipality in North 24-Parganas, admitted to not having a treatment plant in place. We dont have adequate money to set up the plant. But we are trying to install it with support from the state government, he said.

 Usha Chowdhury of Garulia municipality in the same district, however, said authorities have set up a plant that is going to be commissioned soon. 

 Our plant is ready, but I dont know why it is not being put into operation, said Chowdhury.

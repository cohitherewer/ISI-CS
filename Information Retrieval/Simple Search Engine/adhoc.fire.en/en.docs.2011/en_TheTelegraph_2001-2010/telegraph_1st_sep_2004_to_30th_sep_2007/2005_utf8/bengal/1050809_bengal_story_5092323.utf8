 Boss bears trainee transfer brunt

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Aug. 8: When investment in north Bengal was looking up and the region was being touted as an ideal destination, a senior manager of a private company was beaten up today by trainee workers, signalling that all was not quite well on this front.

 Manoj Dhokania, the regional manager of Amrit Feeds Ltd, was in his Raninagar factory office, about 35 km from here, when a group of about 50 people, including six trainee workers, barged into his chamber. They were armed with lathis and before I could initiate any dialogue, they beat me up and also tried to strangulate me, said Dhokania, who is now at a nursing home here. 

 Dhokania and Pradip Bagla, the managing director of the company who flew in from Calcutta on hearing about the attack, however, said there was no apparent reason for the trainees to misbehave. Everything was going on well at our factory, which was set up here last year, Bagla said. Dhokania, who was transferred here from Bihar three months ago, identified six trainees before he fell unconscious, Bagla added. 

 They were apparently protesting against the transfer of some of their colleagues. Two trainees were recently notified about their transfer to our Bishnupur (Bankura) plant, Bagla said, adding that he did not know they were opposed to it.

 A Calcutta-based company with a turnover of over Rs 300 crore, Amrit operates in Bankura, Howrah, Birbhum and Burdwan and has plants in Bihar and Orissa as well. Having introduced contract farming about four months ago, the company has about 250 families engaged in poultry farming in Jalpaiguri.

 No matter what the reason or whatever we may have said or done against them, this manner of retaliation is not justified. That our trainees were joined by hordes of outsiders in the attack just shows the place in a negative light. If this situation continues, we will be forced to wind up our business here, he added. 

 With the company planning to expand, the workers were being trained in supervision of farming and vaccination activities. Nowhere else had we faced this kind of problem, Bagla said. 

 Incidentally, there are no trade unions at Amrits Raninagar factory. If our workers want to form unions, we will welcome them. We are not afraid of trade unionism. But this kind of hooliganism is different and cannot be entertained, Bagla said.

 Rahul Srivastava, the Jalpaiguri superintendent of police, said a police picket has been posted on the factory premises. The management has informed us that there was a problem following the transfer of a few trainee workers. We will start a case as soon as a written complaint is made, which is expected this evening, and conduct raids in the area to nab the culprits, he said.

 Biswajit Das, the secretary of Focin, has condemned the incident. All the efforts of the government to woo investment in the region will fall flat because of these stray incidents, Das said.

 Student on holiday raped

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Sept. 4: A 13-year-old who went to spend the weekend with her grandmother in Kalyani was allegedly raped by one of her neighbours.

 Basudeb Das, 32, a father of two girls aged seven and 13, took her away from Putul Bala on Friday apparently because the elderly woman was running temperature.

 The girl, a resident of Panihati in North 24-Parganas and a Class VII student of a school in Sodepur on the northern fringes of Calcutta, was allegedly dragged out of a room where she was sleeping with Dass daughters and raped.

 Yesterday morning, the girl returned to her grandmother sobbing. After much coaxing, she broke down to narrate the torture she went through, Putul Bala said.

 As the news spread, villagers assaulted Das and ransacked his house. Police rescued him from being lynched and took him in custody.

 We have arrested Basudeb on the basis of a complaint from the victims grandmother. She has been sent for medical examination, said Nadia additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh. Bruises on her body suggest rape, Ghosh added. We are almost certain it is a case of rape, but must wait for the medical report.

 How could Basudeb do this? Putul Bala asked. He has two daughters....

 Postman who did not deliver letters 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Behrampore, Jan. 12: From a hundred kilograms of old missives sold as junk tumbled out an appointment letter, an admit card, an admission notice and the shocking secret that postman Sisir Dutta has not been delivering letters for about five years. 

 As word spread, residents of Begunbari village in Murshidabad?s Beldanga area ransacked the house of the 48-year-old post office employee. 

 Sisir has been arrested. 

 For the past five years, Sisir has been handing out some letters to his teenaged son Palash for distribution and stowing away the rest at home. 

 A couple of days ago, he sold the old letters bundled in packets to a junk dealer. The lot found its way to a bigger trader, Mostaq Sheikh, in Beldanga market, who opened the packets to find sealed letters. 

 Suspicious, he informed the villagers. They came to his shop and found an appointment letter from the health department in the name of Najibur Rahman, the admit card to a railway examination for another youth, Minarul Haque, and a letter confirming Imazuddin Sheikh?s admission to a junior basic training school.

 The three are still unemployed. 

 Enraged, they raided Sisir?s house. He fled by the back door as the residents ransacked his house. A complaint with the police led to the postman?s arrest. 

 ?What the postman has done is unpardonable. He has played around with people?s fate. I appeared for the interview in 2002. Many of those who appeared for the interview with me are already working. I thought I had failed,? said Najibur.

 Suicide after tiff with mum

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 22: Unable to get her mothers approval of her love affair, 15-year-old Shrabani Roy from Munchipara committed suicide by hanging herself this morning.

 Police found a suicide note from the girls bedroom, which mentioned what drove her to death but did not hold anyone responsible for it.

 The police said the incident took place around 10.30 am when Shrabani, a student of Class IX in a north Calcutta girls school, was alone at her Premchand Boral Street home. 

 Her mother had gone to a nearby market to buy vegetables and fish. She returned home to find her daughter hanging from the ceiling. She immediately called her neighbours, who rushed Shrabani to Medical College and Hospital where doctors declared her dead, said Anuj Sharma, the deputy commissioner of police, headquarters.

 According to officers of Munchipara police station, Shrabani had a relationship with a boy and her mother came to know about it a few weeks ago. She was against the relationship from the beginning and told Shrabani that she was not mature enough to be involved in such affairs, said an officer.

 But Shrabani did not pay any heed to the advice and continued with the relationship. 

 Shrabanis mother came to know about this last night and gave her a piece of her mind. Shrabani was waiting for the time when she would be alone at home. The incident happened immediately after her mother left for shopping, the officer said.

 Twin mishaps: Two men in their mid-20s were killed in separate mishaps in the North Port police station area last night. The body of one of them was found lying in a pool of blood on Strand Road. The other youth was crushed to death under the wheels of a lorry on the approach to Howrah bridge. The driver of the lorry is absconding. None of the victims has been identified.

 Symbol salvo on Subrata

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 7: Trinamul Congress general secretary Mukul Roy today filed a writ petition in Calcutta High Court seeking a directive to Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim to conclude complaint proceedings against former mayor Subrata Mukherjee, who left the party and joined the Nationalist Congress Party.

 Roy pointed out that the NCP was allotted a clock symbol by the state election commission during the recent municipal elections. As Mukherjee contested the election on this symbol against the Trinamul Congress, he cannot be a member of the Trinamul anymore, Roy argued.

 The Trinamul leader said Mukherjee has been declared elected as a NCP candidate.

 Mukherjee countered that he had never become a member of the NCP and had only hired the partys symbol. Let them prove that I am a member of the NCP. I contested the civic polls as an Independent candidate, he said.

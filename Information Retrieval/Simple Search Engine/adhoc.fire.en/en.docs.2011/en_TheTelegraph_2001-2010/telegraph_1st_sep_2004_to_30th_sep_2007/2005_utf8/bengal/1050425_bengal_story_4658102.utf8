 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, April 24: Former Trinamul Congress MP Akbar Ali Khondakar died tonight in a Delhi hospital. He was 47 and is survived by wife Swati and 6-year-old daughter Akhisri. 

 The president of the party?s Hooghly unit, he was undergoing treatment for cirrhosis of liver at Gangaram Hospital. Khondakar became the Congress MLA from Chanditala in 1991 before joining Trinamul. He won the Serampore Lok Sabha seat in 1998 and 1999. In 2004, he lost to the CPM candidate. Mamata Banerjee is likely to go to Delhi tomorrow.

 Howrah: Police investigations have made little progress a day after Ritika Chakraborty, 42, died in a nursing home following an alleged botched-up gum surgery. Officers said they were hesitant to arrest the accused doctors in the wake of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s statement that they cannot be picked up merely on the basis of FIRs.

 Patients on water duty

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Barasat, Dec. 17: Mohammed Yasin, who was admitted to the Basirhat sub-divisional hospital with head injuries three days ago, was advised rest until his wounds healed.

 Little did his doctors know that Yasin would have to go out of the hospital every day to the tributary of the Bidyadhari nearby to fetch water. Besides, he has to get drinking water from a tube well outside the hospital as the one on the compound does not work.

 Nearly 300 patients, including 30 mothers carrying their newborns, have been undergoing the same ordeal for the last five days at the government hospital, about 60 km from Calcutta.

 Though we have been repeatedly complaining about lack of water supply in the hospital, nothing has been done so far, alleged Yasin. I am left with no option but to go out of the hospital to get water.

 Mitul Dutta, who delivered a baby a few days ago, said: We are fed up with the state of affairs in the hospital. My husband has to purchase drinking water from outside everyday. 

 The condition of the hospital lavatory is worse than hell since there is no water to get it cleaned.

 The hospital authorities said two pumps for water supply maintained by the public health engineering department have been out of order for over a month.

 Though we have informed the department and requested it to repair them on a priority basis, no action has been taken, said hospital superintendent Indrajit Acharya.

 He said if at least one pump was repaired, it could have eased the crisis. We dont know what to do. As a last resort, we have approached the Basirhat municipality to send us drinking water in tankers till normality is restored.

 However, officials of the public health engineering department said the problem lies with the 300-foot-deep tube well from which water is lifted with the help of the pumps.

 The tube well has become defective and it will take time to get the system restored, said Ratan De, an official of the department.

 The chief medical officer of health services, North 24-Parganas, K. Adhikari, said he has sanctioned necessary funds to make at least one pump operational so that water from the tube well outside the hospital can be used.

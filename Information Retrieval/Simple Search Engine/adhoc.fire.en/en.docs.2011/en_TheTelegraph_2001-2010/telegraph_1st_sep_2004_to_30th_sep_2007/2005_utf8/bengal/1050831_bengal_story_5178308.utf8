 Dengue goes to districts

 - Fever, aches amp; vomiting ring alarm

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Illambazar, Aug. 30: The first signs of dengue striking Birbhum became evident today as several cases of classical dengue fever were reported from here. 

 Bijoy Mukherjee, the principal of Burdwan Medical College and Hospital, led a four-member medical team that collected blood samples at Illambazar primary health centre, about 240 km from Calcutta, and confirmed that clinical examination of 130 patients showed that most could be suffering from it. 

 Though we are collecting blood samples to be certain, the symptoms we have seen among most patients seem to be all that of classical dengue cases, Mukherjee said. Around 140 patients were admitted to the health centre with high fever and body-ache and recurrent vomiting. 

 The team has collected the blood samples of the patients for tests in a better-equipped laboratory in Burdwan.

 With three people showing dengue-like symptoms dying in Birbhum, the district health administration sought help from the medical college to identify the disease. 

 Manoranjan Biswas, 50, died yesterday. Earlier, Surojit Sutradhar, 17, died at Bolpur Subdivisional Hospital and Saleha Khatun, 13, of Illambazar, in the medical college.

 Health department officials said two more patients of Illambazar possibly died of dengue a few days ago. Safiunnesa Khatun, 13, died in a private nursing home at Shaktigarh near Burdwan after bleeding from her ears and mouth. Ajijul Haque, 7, who showed similar symptoms, died in the same nursing home. 

 The department has also warned that villages like Payer, Nildanga and Debogram could be reeling under dengue fever if urgent remedial measures were not taken.

 Nilkamal Roy, a middle-aged man from Nildanga near Illambazar, was admitted to the primary health centre this morning. I am suffering from high fever and body-ache for the past four days. After I vomited yesterday, the doctor suggested that I get admitted, he said.

 Chief medical officer Shyamapada Basak said doctors and nurses have been called in from Bolpur and Dubrajpur.

 School job back after 31 years

 Calcutta, Nov. 29: A school clerk, who was forced to resign 31 years ago because he was suffering from TB, should get back his job in six months, the high court said today.

 Akhtar Hossein Sarkar was 23 when he joined Chandrakona Junior School in 1970. 

 In 1974, Sarkar, a clerk at the school in Chandrakona ? now in West Midnapore ? 180 km from Calcutta, was diagnosed with TB and forced to quit. 

 He lodged a complaint with the local police station but it did nothing. Rupumuddin Ahmed Sarkar, a relative of the headmaster, was recruited in Hossein Sarkars place. He approached the director of school education and the district inspector of schools. 

 The inspector kept mum. The director held that Sarkars claim was valid but he could not be taken back as another person had been recruited. 

 In 1993, Sarkar moved the high court. It asked the school education department to allow him to resume duties. The order was not carried out. In 1994, Sarkar again moved the court. It directed the department to create a new post. This order, too, was not obeyed. In 2003, Rupumuddin died. Sarkar again moved the court.

 Justice Girish Gupta today gave the government six months to reinstate him.

 Fingers in bag, man walks to hospital amp; nurses faint 

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Calcutta, Sept. 3: His severed palm and fingers in a plastic packet, Babloo Kolay reached a hospital for help. The nurses on duty almost fainted.

 With minimal first-aid in the hospital at Tahalampur in Hooghly, Kolay was made to travel to Calcutta. 

 The 45-year-old was working in a steel sheet-manufacturing unit on Thursday when a friend called him. Unmindful of the sharp edges of the machine running perilously close, Kolay looked up to his friend, only to realise seconds later that there is a blood spray around him. 

 Everybody was shouting but I did not realise what happened until I found one of my fingers lying near the machine, recalled Kolay. Then he saw the other fingers. 

 The palm, too, was not in place. I knew I had a family to feed and could not afford to lose my right hand, Kolay said. Most of his colleagues still in shock, he clutched his palm and put the fingers in a plastic bag. 

 There was blood all over. He has always been fearless but I do not know from where he mustered the courage to walk down to the hospital, said his brother Asit.

 The personnel at the Hooghly hospital possibly lost nerve as Kolay pleaded for help, the bag in hand. He was brought to the city, about 80 km away, a couple of hours later, still without treatment.

 When Asit wheeled him into Calcutta Medical Research Institute, plastic surgeon Anupam Golash was preparing for his evening rounds. I would have gone home after the rounds, but this case sounded bizarre, he said.

 Golash took the severed portions of Kolays hand and scanned them to see the extent of damage. It showed that the fingers and palm could be re-attached. We kept the severed parts in a refrigerator and informed Kolay that he would have to undergo a marathon surgery, the doctor said. Kolay was unperturbed. Wife Tanusree by his side, he asked the doctors to go ahead. For the next 12 hours, Golash and his team re-implanted the fingers. 

 Recuperating in the hospital, Kolay is now itching to get back to work. The doctors are amazed at his exemplary courage.

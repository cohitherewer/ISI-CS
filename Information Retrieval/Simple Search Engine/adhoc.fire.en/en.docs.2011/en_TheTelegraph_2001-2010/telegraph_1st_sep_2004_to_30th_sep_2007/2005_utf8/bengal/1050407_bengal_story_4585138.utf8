 Transport revamp on cards

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, April 6: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is ready with an action plan to revamp the five state transport corporations and offload the burden of paying a Rs 200 crore subsidy every year.

 ?The effort to restructure the state transport sector is part of the government?s initiative to reorganise the 29 sick PSUs. The restructuring, especially providing ERS (Early Retirement Scheme) to a section of employees, is expected to be done with financial assistance from the World Bank, ADB and the DFID. We have submitted the proposal to the Centre to get the foreign funds,?? said Sunil Mitra, the industrial reconstruction secretary.

 A study was conducted by consultants appointed by the government to assess the status of its loss-making and sick PSUs. The experts also examined ways to revive the PSUs and make them self-reliant, Mitra added.

 Consulting Engineering Services (CES) bagged the transport sector assignment. It prepared a report on the status of the five transport corporations and steps to make them viable without depending on government subsidy.

 According to the transport plan, at least 5,000 employees will have to accept ERS. The ERS amount will be fixed after discussions at various levels, including the trade unions concerned.

 Apart from downsizing the staff strength, the proposal includes scrapping of old fleet, introduction of new buses for the city, reduction of overhead expenditure, involvement of private parties, fixing operational jurisdiction of the corporations and resource mobilisation.

 The CES report points out that productivity and income are gradually decreasing as old vehicles consume more fuel but give poor service. Moreover, the pay packet of the massive workforce of 25,000 gobbles up the lion?s share of the funds received as subsidy.

 The number of employees in some corporations is much higher than what is required, the report adds. 

 Out of the five, the West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation is the only one that is self-reliant and does not take subsidy from the government. So there is no proposal to offer ERS to its employees.

 Strike at climber hub

 VIVEK CHHETRI

 Darjeeling, Aug. 6: Employees of the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute (HMI) today declared an indefinite cease-work to protest against increased recruitment of military personnel on deputation.

 The staff decided to launch an agitation after the institutes principal, J.S. Dhillon, locked the office of his personnel assistant, Mahindra Prahan, and refused him entry before leaving for Delhi today.

 Prahan is the president of the HMI unit of the Hill Employees Association (HEA), to which the staff are affiliated.

 The employees have refused to budge unless civilian staff are placed in 12 posts which have been filled by military personnel. The institute has around 75 employees.

 Trouble had started brewing when the employees demanded that the issue of withdrawal of military staff be included in the agenda of the institutes executive committee meeting, which was held in Calcutta on July 23. Till 1986, only the principal and the medical officer were military personnel.

 The HEA also wrote to defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, stating their demand. Mukherjee and Basu are, respectively, president and vice-president of the institute.

 Though the employees demand did not figure on the agenda, the principal, after his return from Calcutta, set up an inquiry committee, alleging that certain civilian employees had leaked information to an unauthorised person.

 The employees, who were asked to turn up for an inquiry, only wanted an explanation on the rationale behind booking them under the Official Secrets Act, when the agenda is circulated throughout the world, said N.B. Kalikotey, vice-president of HEAs central committee.

 The association alleged that Prahan was being made a scapegoat, as he is the president of its unit at the HMI. Prahan refused to speak on the issue.

 Dhillon, speaking over phone from Delhi, said: The reason why the army personnel were brought in was to stop such strikes. There are a few employees with vested interests who are trying to disrupt the normal functioning of the institute.

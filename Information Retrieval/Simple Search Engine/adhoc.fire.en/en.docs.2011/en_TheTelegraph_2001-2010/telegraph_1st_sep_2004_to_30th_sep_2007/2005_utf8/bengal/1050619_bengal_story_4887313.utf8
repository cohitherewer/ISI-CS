 Subrata or CPM? Curtain set to go up

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, June 18: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the vote-catcher, or Mamata Banerjee, the beleaguered fighter? Subrata Mukherjee, the apparently popular incumbent, or the CPM, the election winning machine? Who will win the civic polls? 

 All questions will be answered as parties ? from the Left to Right ? prepare to face the test tomorrow in one of the most keenly fought civic polls in recent times. 

 The 2005 municipal polls dwarf the earlier ones in terms of complexities and implications. 

 Their most distinguishing mark is the domination by national-level politics. The growing stature of the CPM, which is crossing over the ideological divide, has begun to mop up ballots from the huge non-Left camp, targeting votebanks it never considered its own. 

 The elections also present a first-time opportunity to the CPM and the Congress, along with its allies, to study the impact of their cosy relationship at the national level on their respective support bases in the state. This assumes added significance with the Assembly elections just a year away. 

 Since the installation of the Manmohan Singh government with support from the Left, the great alliance ? which Mamata Banerjee famously described as Dosti in Delhi, kusti in Calcutta ? will come under the microscope for the first time in the last one-and-a-half years. It will also indicate whether, at the ground level, it has helped or harmed the parties.

 Opinion polls have indicated what is widely expected: that the Left will wrest back the board in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation. But it is the margin ? whether it will be comfortable ? that has got the Marxists worried.

 Indicating that the party has managed to bridge the ideological gulf in the city to some extent, CPM state secretary and politburo member Anil Biswas said he was optimistic that the party would be the choice of most of the two lakh new voters.

 These are the people who belong to the younger generation and span all sections of society and they will vote for us, Biswas said. We had observed this trend during the Lok Sabha polls as well, and we expect them to propel us to victory.

 CPM sources said reports received from zonal and local committees indicate that the party is fairly comfortable in 60 of the 141 seats in the CMC. However, it is another set of 25 seats that the party is unsure about.

 The CPM feels the 25 marginal seats will decide whether the Left will form the board. These are also the seats the party had been concentrating on in the run-up to the polls. For the rest, the CPM feels, the lions share will go to the Trinamul Congress with the Congress making do with the leftovers.

 Displaying what many see as a sign of nervousness, Congress leader Somen Mitra said the CPM has started bringing in outsiders into important wards, both in Calcutta and Salt Lake. 

 The CPM is following a policy of might is right as usual, he said. They will try to terrorise our supporters into submission and then resort to rigging. If they do well, it will be only through the unfair route, Mitra said.

 Trinamuls all-India general secretary Mukul Roy echoed the Congress leader. We had complained to the Election Commission that the CPM was getting goons from outside the city to rig the polls but no action has been taken, he said. The polls may well turn out to be a farce.

 The political thunderstorms aside, the weather will play an important role in tomorrows elections. If it continues to be scorching and the voter turn-out is thin, the Left will be in luck.

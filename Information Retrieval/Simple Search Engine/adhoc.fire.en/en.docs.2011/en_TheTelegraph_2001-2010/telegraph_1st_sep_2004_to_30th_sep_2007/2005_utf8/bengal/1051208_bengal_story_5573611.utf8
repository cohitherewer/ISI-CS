 Hunt for doctor facing molest slur

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Dec. 7: Police have launched a search for a doctor of Bhatar rural health centre accused of molesting a housewife last evening while examining her in his official quarters.

 Gynaecologist Kaustav Chatterjee could not be found at the health centre, 140 km from Calcutta, when the police went looking for him after the 22-year-old woman and her father-in-law, Pitram Majhi, lodged a complaint today.

 Soon after the news of the molestation spread, about 100 villagers, including the womans family members and relatives, demonstrated at the health centre last night. Block medical officer Haradhan Banerjee tried to sort out the matter but failed.

 No doctor is allowed to examine any patient in his quarters. If the doctor is arrested, he will be immediately suspended. I have also sought a report from the chief medical officer of health of Burdwan, director of health service Prabhakar Chatterjee said in Calcutta.

 Majhi said his daughter-in-law had been suffering cramps in the abdomen and showing signs of pregnancy. She could not be accompanied by her husband Mrinmoy as he works in a medicine shop in Burdwan town, about 40 km from Bhatar, and returns home late.

 We were very cautious about her as she suffered a miscarriage a few months ago. We took her to the health centre around 7.30 pm yesterday. The doctor was not there. When health employees informed him at his quarters, he asked them to send us there, said Majhi.

 When they went to the doctors quarters within the health centre compound, he asked Majhi to wait outside. An hour later, my daughter-in-law came out crying and told me that she had been molested, said Pitram.

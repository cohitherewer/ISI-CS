 Calcutta, March 27: In a virtual rebuff to Congress president Pranab Mukherjee, Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee today said her party needed no advice on electoral alliances and would rather go it alone.

 Mamata?s remark dimmed the prospects of a Congress-Trinamul pact ahead of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation elections in June.

 Mamata said let those advising her to quit the NDA first leave the CPM, which is backing the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre. 

 Mukherjee had asked Mamata to sever ties with the NDA before mulling a pact with the Congress. 

 ?A Congress leader has been giving a lot of advice to Trinamul for a long time. I just want to say that whether a party will speak to another on poll alliance is entirely its own prerogative. I want to tell those leaders who are advising me to quit the NDA that they first leave the CPM. This is sheer hypocrisy. You want to fight the party with which you have allied in Delhi. Our party doesn?t believe in such things,? Mamata told a news conference at her Kalighat house.

 But Trinamul mayor Subrata Mukherjee was with Pranab Mukherjee at a programme in the city this evening and was heard singing his praise. ?In my political career, I have always remained indebted to two personalities ? Indira Gandhi and Pranab Mukherjee and I have no qualms about admitting that,? said the mayor. 

 He gave no indication about any possible alliance.

 The state Congress chief, also the defence minister, said it was ?unfortunate? that ?narrow political ends? come in the way of development. ?We tend to think in terms of (political) colours. But, when it comes to working together for development, political affiliations should not create barriers.?

 Mamata said Trinamul had its own policy-making body and was capable of taking its own decisions. ?How can someone impose conditions on us?? she asked, adding that Trinamul had been fighting the CPM all alone in the state. ?We don?t need anyone?s help to fight the CPM.?

 Mukherjee said the Congress?s alliance with Trinamul in the past (the 2001 Assembly polls) did not really pay off. He also denied having advised the party on its strategy. ?The question of advice doesn?t arise. Every party has its ideals... We did go into a pact with them and did not benefit,? he said.

 Trinamul insiders said chances of a pact before the civic polls were bleak. ?However, Congress councillors can back Trinamul after the polls to help form an anti-Left board,? a Trinamul leader said.

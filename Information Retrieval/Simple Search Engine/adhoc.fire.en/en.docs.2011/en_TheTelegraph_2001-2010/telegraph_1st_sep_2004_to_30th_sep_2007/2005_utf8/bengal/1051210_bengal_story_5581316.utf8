 Friend foe

 Calcutta, Dec. 9: A 38-year-old deaf-mute woman was allegedly raped by a youth almost half her age at Kultali, South 24-Parganas, on Wednesday.

 Police said Bhulo Mistry, 20, an unemployed youth known well to the woman and her family, entered the house that evening when her parents were still busy in the paddy field. 

 She gestured to her father later that she had been raped.

 Officials of Kultali police station, 60 km from Calcutta, initially refused to accept Madan Mondals complaint. 

 Mandal went to Kakdwip subdivisional police officer Subhas Sen yesterday. He initiated a probe.

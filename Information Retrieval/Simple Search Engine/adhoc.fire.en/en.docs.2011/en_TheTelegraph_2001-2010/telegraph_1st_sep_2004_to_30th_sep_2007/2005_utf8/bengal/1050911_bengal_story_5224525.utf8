 Govt prepares road for foreign funds 

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Calcutta, Sept. 10: The Bengal government is paving the road for smooth investment traffic.

 With a view to improve connectivity in and around Calcutta ? which is a prerequisite to draw investment to the state ? a board has been formed for drawing a comprehensive road development policy.

 Led by commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen, the Road Advisory Board will take up the planning and co-ordination of all future road and expressway projects and also road maintenance. 

 Forming the board became imperative after a slew of road and expressway projects in the city and the outskirts were cleared recently. 

 Ministers of the public works department, transport and urban development will be members of the board as also officials from the department of municipal affairs. 

 New projects will be taken up according to the governments overall priority and finances will also be worked out accordingly, PWD minister Amar Chowdhury said today.

 The chief engineer, planning and quality assurance of the public works (roads) directorate will be the member secretary. He will be responsible for setting quality standards. 

 The board will also prepare the roadmap for the state and a master plan for finances.

 Officials cited the proposed Eastern Expressway as an example of haphazard project planning in the government. 

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority first conceptualised the expressway, linking Bhatpara in North 24-Parganas to Kalikapur in South 24-Parganas. Later, the commerce and industry department took up the project and modified it, proposing that the expressway should run from the Barasat Bypass near NH 34 in the north to the Kulpi port in the south. 

 Recently, the housing department also proposed a seven-kilometre extension of an arterial road running through New Town to Barasat. This is to be built by the transport department in a joint venture with a private partner. 

 The proposed six-lane highway will run from New Town, skirt the airport and join Old Jessore Road at Ganganagar in Barasat, eventually meeting NH 34.

 It is easy to visualise what would happen if all these individual projects were to materialise in such close proximity to each other. Since road construction and maintenance is undertaken by so many departments, it was decided that all of them would participate in formulating one road policy under the guidance of Nirupam Sen, an official said.

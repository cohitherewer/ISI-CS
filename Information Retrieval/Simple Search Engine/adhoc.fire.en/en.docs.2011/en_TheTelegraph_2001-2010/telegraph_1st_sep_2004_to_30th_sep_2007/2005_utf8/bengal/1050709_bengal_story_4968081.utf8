 Rs 99 lakh whisked off Geetanjali 

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Midnapore, July 8: A briefcase containing Rs 99 lakh was snatched from a private security agency team on the Howrah-Mumbai Geetanjali Express after it left Kalaikunda this afternoon.

 Police said the snatch was carried out in a mysterious manner. The whole episode is mysterious. We have detained the three persons and are interrogating them, said S.S. Panda, superintendent of railway police, Kharagpur.

 Ajay Debnath, S. Singh and M. Singh had got into an AC two-tier compartment of the train from Howrah with the briefcase. In their complaint, they claimed the money belonged to a private bank and they were taking it from Calcutta to Jamshedpur.

 The three were allegedly asleep when the train left Kharagpur. Around 3.40 pm, as the train was pulling out of Kalaikunda, Debnath claimed he was woken up by a group of persons who threatened him with a knife and asked for the key of the briefcase. 

 They then snapped the chain binding the briefcase to the seat, pulled the alarm and jumped off.

 When the train reached Jhargram, the trio lodged a complaint with Government Railway Police. They were later detained. 

 The chain was indeed broken. But it is unusual that other passengers did not know anything about it. Debnath claimed the miscreants robbed the briefcase but his companions said they knew nothing about it, Panda said.

 We are looking at all possible angles. At this point, it seems the trio may be involved in more ways than one.

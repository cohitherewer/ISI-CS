 Pranab backs talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 10: State Congress president Pranab Mukherjee today indicated that the party would continue talking to Trinamul Congress leaders in its bid to forge an alliance to fight the CPM in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation elections in June.

 Mukherjee put his seal of approval on Priya Ranjan Das Munshi?s meeting with Subrata Mukherjee late on Friday night. ?Priya had consulted me before meeting the mayor. I also spoke to him in Farakka yesterday,? Mukherjee said.

 He also said: ?It was an informal meeting and we have not come to any decision regarding any alliance with Trinamul. I will speak to my colleagues in the party,? he added.

 Mukherjee, also the defence minister, reiterated that it was not possible for the Congress to forge an alliance with Trinamul till it severed ties with the BJP.

 Friday?s meeting between Das Munshi and the mayor has not gone down well with Mamata Banerjee. Trinamul insiders said Mamata was ?irritated? with Subrata and the Congress?s attempt to stress the need for an alliance ahead of the city civic polls.

 They said Mamata today instructed the party?s youth wing to campaign against the Congress and its ?alliance? with the CPM. Party general secretary and youth leader Madan Mitra led a procession in Esplanade where slogans were shouted saying the state Congress was a CPM stooge. 

 ?We don?t need any alliance with the Congress. In 2000, we did not have a track record like we have now, but still we wrested the board from the CPM,?said Mitra.

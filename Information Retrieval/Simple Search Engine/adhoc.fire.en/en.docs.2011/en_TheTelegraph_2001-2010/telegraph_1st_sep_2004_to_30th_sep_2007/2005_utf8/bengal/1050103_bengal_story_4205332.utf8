 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Jan. 2: Relatives and friends of a patient today beat up Burdwan Medical College and Hospital officials, including its deputy superintendent, and ransacked offices alleging neglect leading to the death of a patient last night.

 A large police force had to chase the rampaging mob out of the hospital.

 Bablu Sheikh, 25, was brought in critical condition from Nababhat, about 120 km from Calcutta, where he met with a road accident. After he passed way, his relatives alleged that the negligence of the attending doctors led to the death. 

 The patient?s side as well as the hospital authorities lodged FIRs with the police.

 Deputy superintendent of police Rabindranath Bhattacharya said five people, who were part of the mob, had been arrested.

 His elder brother, Sheikh Safikul, said a doctor saw him five hours after he was admitted. ?Till then, the only treatment he got was saline drip.?

 Hotel ice broken, says govt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 12: Buoyed by the Great Eastern Hotel employees? response to the early retirement scheme, Writers? Buildings is trying to ensure that all workers willing to opt for it can do so.

 It will decide tomorrow whether a counter can be opened to distribute ERS forms during the four-day holiday starting Thursday. 

 Forms at the hotel counter have found no takers, apparently because of the presence of union leaders. But seven forms were picked up yesterday from the counter at the tourism office on Brabourne Road, which would be closed over the weekend. 

 ?If we detect willingness among the employees to opt for the scheme, we might also consider revising the April 18 deadline,? a senior government official said.

 The government would even accept forms without all requisite documents for the time being, said tourism secretary T.K. Barman. ?Our basic intention is to gauge the willingness of the employees... The paper work can be done later.?

 Six of the officers who had picked up the forms deposited them today. Another form was picked up this afternoon. ?The ice has finally been broken,? said a senior official.

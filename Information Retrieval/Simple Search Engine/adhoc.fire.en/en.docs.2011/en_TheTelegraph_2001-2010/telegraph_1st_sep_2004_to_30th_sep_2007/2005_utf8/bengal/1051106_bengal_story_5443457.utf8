 Boys body comes home

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 5: The coffin of one of the boys who died in a crash in Bangalore yesterday was brought home this morning. 

 If you can, forgive me. You wanted to spend a few more days with us, but I like a fool pushed you to your death by insisting that you return to your college, forgive me, sobbed Ramen Gayen, clinging to the coffin that bore the body of his only son.

 The 19-year-olds body was brought today to his paternal uncles house at 56, Bangur Avenue. 

 Suryadip was one of the four students who died when the Maruti car they were in collided with a truck in Tumkur, 70 km from Bangalore. Another student was critically injured.

 They were all second-year students of Sri Siddhartha Institute of Technology and were returning to their hostel after attending a Diwali party . 

 Suryadip, Parijat Dasgupta, Sabyasachi Sarkar and Subhojit Som died on the spot while Debojit was taken to hospital. 

 Suryadip wanted to leave after bhai phonta but his father insisted that he go back immediately after Durga Puja, thinking that his studies would be hampered. Now it is his greatest lament, said Subhankar Chowdhury, Suryadips uncle. 

 The body was flown in to Dum Dum airport around 8 am and reached Bangur Avenue an hour and a half later. 

 Residents of Bangur Avenue flocked to the street to bid farewell to the 19-year-old. 

 Suryadip was quite popular in the area. Apart from being a good cricket player, he was also a member of the local Amra Shobai club. The family is devastated and so are his neighbours at Bangur Avenue, said childhood friend Debjit Roy.

 We did not look at the body, which had been wrapped as it was badly mutilated. Bangalore police told us the impact of the collision was so hard that the entire car was crushed. It took two hours to cut open the car and bring out the body, he added.

 Suryadip, who earlier used to stay in Bangur Avenue, had recently shifted to Karunamoyee in Salt Lake, with his parents.

 The state police has offered help to the families of all the four victims.

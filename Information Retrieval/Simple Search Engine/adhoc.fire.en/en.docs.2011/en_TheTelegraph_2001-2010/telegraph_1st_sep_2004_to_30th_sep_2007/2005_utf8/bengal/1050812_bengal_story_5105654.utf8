 Election curb

 Calcutta, Aug. 11: Those evading arrest under non-bailable warrants for the past six months cannot contest elections. The Election Commission today told all the states to delete such peoples names from the electoral rolls.

 The commission has asked us to finish the job by September 19, Bengal chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee said. If these people havent been arrested for six months, it means they have not been living in their homes for that period. So their names can be removed.

 This implies they cannot contest elections either. The commission hasnt explained why the cut-off time is six months.

 Officer held hostage by school heads 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, April 7: Over 150 primary school headmasters gheraoed the block development officer of Hanskhali in Nadia for over eight hours yesterday demanding an increased allotment for mid-day meals from March.

 The state government had issued a circular in February saying the Centre had raised the allotment for the meals from Re 1 to Rs 2 for every student. The headmasters thought the new allotment would be effective from March, though the circular mentioned April.

 Yesterday, BDO Tamal Das had summoned the school heads to collect their quota of funds for March. The headmasters got furious seeing they were being paid at the ?old rate?. 

 The siege continued till around 9 in the night. Das was not even allowed to make telephone calls. Ranaghat subdivisional officer Mezbaoul Haque said: ?They are respectable citizens, but they abused the officer and heckled him. I have asked Das to lodge an FIR against the headmasters.? The BDO was allowed to leave office after he apologised and assured that he would write to his superiors about their demand.

 Manoranjan Kirtonia, the headmaster of a Hanskhali school, about 70 km from Calcutta, said: ?We have already doubled our expenditure. Students are being served fish or egg every day. We also give meat to them at least twice a week. We buy provisions on credit. Who is going to pay for them??

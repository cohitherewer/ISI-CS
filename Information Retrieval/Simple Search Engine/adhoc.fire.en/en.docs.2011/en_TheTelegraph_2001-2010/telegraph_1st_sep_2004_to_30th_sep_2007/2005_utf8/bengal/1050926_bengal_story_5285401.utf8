 Hawks chant business mantra

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: A day before the chief ministers rally in South 24-Parganas, to explain to farmers the need to hand over land to the Salim Group, leaders of the CPMs peasants wing began a campaign asking them to give up farmland for industry.

 Times are fast changing. More people will benefit if industries are set up on farmland. Farmers will have to graduate from agriculture to industries, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla told a rally, organised by the Paschimbanga Pradeshik Krishak Sabha. 

 Molla, who had triggered a debate in the CPM a few months ago regarding the use of farmland for industry, today pleaded with farmers to enable the government to identify suitable land for the Indonesia-based group. There will not be any pressure. We will take over land after paying adequate compensation.

 The minister said proper roads have to be constructed for the special economic zone, which the Salim Group wants to create in the district. An 85-km road connecting Raichak in South 24-Parganas with Barasat in North is in the pipeline. Farmers should cooperate with the government by giving up their land, he said. 

 Molla added that it would be foolish not to allow entrepreneurs to invest in Bengal. If we do not provide land, they will go elsewhere.

 Observers said Molla came around to accept Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees initiative on the Salim projects after the CPM leadership prevailed upon him. He was asked to buttress the initiative by telling farmers that only fallow and mono-crop lands would be given to the Salim Group. 

 Moreover, Mamata Banerjees recent campaign against the conversion of land also made Molla and other CPM hardliners see merit in the governments pro-industry line. 

 Benoy Konar, who was once opposed to the takeover, today said industries could generate more employment than agriculture. He told the rally: A motorcycle factory is coming up in Hooghly. I think the proposed unit can employ more youths than the actual number of farmers now working in the agricultural land.

 Bill sparks row

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Feb. 26: A consumer was today manhandled by West Bengal State Electricity Board employees and some contractors for complaining against some staff members.

 Pritikona Pal Roy and her husband, a resident of Calcutta who owns a house here, had rushed to the town to pay an electricity bill. Employees at the utility?s office could not trace the bill but forced Pritikona to pay a fine of Rs 50, along with the bill, and allegedly refused to even give a receipt for the fine.

 Pritikona then went to office superintendent Prabir Sinha to lodge a complaint. At least 30 other consumers waiting to pay bills joined her.

 Suddenly, some employees and contractors entered Sinha?s chamber and started beating up Pritikona and her husband. However, consumers defended the couple.

 Police said an employee of the office has been arrested.

 The consumer alleged that the officials went to disconnect supply at her home without sending the bill. ?The bill had gone missing from the WBSEB office. The employees had tried to cover up by collecting a fine,? she said.

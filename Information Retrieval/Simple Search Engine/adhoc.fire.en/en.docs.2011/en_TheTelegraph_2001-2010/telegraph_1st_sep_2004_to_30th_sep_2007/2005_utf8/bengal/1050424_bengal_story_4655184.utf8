 A stitch in time saves a limb

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 23: Over a thousand people lose their limbs in accidents in the city every year, out of which at least 800 can avoid amputation if they are operated upon quickly.

 Minutes after he was injured in a motorcycle accident a fortnight ago, Rajiv Rajkhowa was told that he would lose his left leg.

 His relatives decided to try their luck. At Peerless Hospital and BK Roy Research Centre, Dr Sabyasachi Ghosh found a huge haematoma (clot of blood) at the back of the thigh above Rajkhowa?s left knee. 

 There was no blood flow at all to the left leg, the doctor said. ?The oxygen saturation of the affected limb was zero, compared to 98 per cent on the right side.?

 But the doctors decided to try to save the limb, an almost impossible task. Senior orthopaedic surgeons Ronen Roy and Sanjay Das were asked to examine Rajkhowa.

 But the biggest problem was that it was almost midnight ? the accident had happened around 10 pm ? and getting together a team of doctors was difficult. ?We managed to pull strings and decided to operate upon Rajkhowa,? Roy said.

 The patient was wheeled into the operation theatre even as intervention cardiologist Devanu Roy and vascular surgeon Debasish Banerjee joined the team of doctors for the emergency surgery.

 In a painstaking surgical procedure that stretched from 12.30 am to 9 am, the doctors recanalised the artery and the blood circulation in the leg was revived. 

 Today, Rajkhowa broke down and said he could not thank the doctors enough. ?It is God?s wish that I landed here.?

 ?He is yet another example of how patients can pull through without having to face the nightmare of losing a limb,? said Roy.

 Tolly drowning: A youth identified as Dinesh Sahu, 28, drowned in the Tolly Nullah today. His body was seen floating around 2.30 pm. Police said the resident of Bhu Kailash Road in Tollygunge drowned while bathing.

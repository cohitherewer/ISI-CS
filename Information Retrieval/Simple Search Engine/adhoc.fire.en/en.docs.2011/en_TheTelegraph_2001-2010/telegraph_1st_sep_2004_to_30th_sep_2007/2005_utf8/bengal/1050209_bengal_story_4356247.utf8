 Varsity red-card warning

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 A college laboratory: All in order?

 Burdwan, Feb. 8: The university here has issued a warning to 34 colleges under its fold after a truth team which paid surprise visits to 60 institutions over the past few months reported gross irregularities. 

 A Burdwan University official said the panel looked into whether teachers arrive on time and take over 50 per cent of their classes. Whether the students attend at least half their classes, if laboratories have proper facilities and whether practical classes are held regularly were also looked into.

 ?We had been getting complaints about the dipping academic graph in a number of colleges and poor attendance of teachers. So, we set up the special committee,? said registrar Shoroshi Mohan Dawn.

 An official said this was the first time that such a truth team was constituted and raids were conducted.

 The university has told the authorities of 34 colleges that if the faults are not rectified immediately, their affiliations may be cancelled. 

 The varsity has 80 undergraduate colleges directly under it, where BA, BSc and BCom courses are taught. Of the 80, 26 are in Burdwan, 14 in Bankura, 11 in Birbhum, 17 in Hooghly and 12 in Purulia.

 The executive council of the university decided to form the committee after a meeting last year in the wake of a spate of complaints. The varsity?s inspector of colleges was chosen to lead the team, which submitted its report indicting 34 colleges last month. 

 An official said the committee also inquired into the students? attitude towards their classes and whether they were skipping them. Whether coming to college only meant ?fun? for them was also surveyed. 

 ?We found that some teachers are habitually absent. Some of them were very busy with personal work even during college hours. These teachers have also been warned,? said an official.

 Students? unions, particularly the CPM?s Students? Federation of India, were vocal about the teachers skipping classes and had urged the authorities to conduct a probe.

 The university, an official said, would also step up vigil on the other institutions under its fold ? those that offer vocational courses and the private colleges. 

 Vice-chancellor Amit Kumar Mullick said: ?The same committee that carried out the surprise checks will also maintain vigil on these colleges to ensure their academic standards do not dip.?

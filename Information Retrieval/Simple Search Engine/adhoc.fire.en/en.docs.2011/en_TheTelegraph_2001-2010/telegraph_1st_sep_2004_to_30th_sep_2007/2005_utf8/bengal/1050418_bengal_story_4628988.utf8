 Village bosses face power amp; pothole heat

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, April 17: A group of villagers, who had put the panchayat office at Sasanga in Khandaghosh, 140 km from Calcutta, under lock and key last Friday in protest against lack of development, thrashed CPM leaders today when they tried to force it open. 

 The village is still without electricity and the condition of its roads appalling ? more so because of the heavy sand-laden lorries from the Damodar, from which the panchayat collects a levy. The residents? repeated requests to the CPM-run village body to press the authorities for power and repair the roads, however, failed to elicit a response.

 This morning, 10 CPM leaders, including panchayat pradhan Sanat Biswas and the party?s branch committee secretary, Basudeb Jamadar, were admitted to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital with serious injuries.

 When police went to their rescue, the villagers rained brickbats on them. Several policemen, including deputy superintendent Dilip Ranjan Bhaduri, were injured. 

 The police resorted to a lathicharge to disperse the mob, but failed. Ten rounds of teargas shells had to be fired. 

 Over 20 people have yet been arrested in connection with the assault, which came about two weeks after chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee announced that all villages in the state would be electrified by 2007.

 District magistrate Subrata Gupta and superintendent of police Niraj Singh went to Sasanga this evening to supervise raids to pick up those who took part in the assault. Most of the menfolk have fled the village, 30 km from Burdwan town, fearing arrest.

 Singh said the panchayat functionaries and other CPM leaders were attacked after they broke open the lock put by the villagers and stepped into the office. ?The villagers gheraoed the leaders and beat them up. When the police went to rescue them, they were attacked as well. The deputy superintendent suffered serious injuries in his face,? Singh added.

 One of the villagers, Amit Das said the discontent was simmering for the past several months. ?We have no proper roads and electricity has not reached here yet. The panchayat collects toll tax from each sand-laden lorry from the banks of the Damodar that passes through our roads. But no repair work is ever taken up.? 

 Many villages in the vicinity of Sasanga have electricity. Sujit Baidya said they frequently pleaded with the panchayat leaders for road repairs and power, but all appeals fell on deaf ears. He said: ?We were only given assurances?. We could not take it any more. So, last Friday, we put the panchayat office under lock and key.?

 From his hospital bed, the panchayat chief said: ?As we entered the office, a large number of villagers came running towards us.? They started beating us with rods. They accused us of not taking up any development work... None of us was spared,? said Biswas.

 When the police spotted Jamadar, he was unconscious. In hospital, he smelt a conspiracy. ?We apprehend the plot was hatched by the Trinamul Congress-BJP combine. They have misled the people against us.?

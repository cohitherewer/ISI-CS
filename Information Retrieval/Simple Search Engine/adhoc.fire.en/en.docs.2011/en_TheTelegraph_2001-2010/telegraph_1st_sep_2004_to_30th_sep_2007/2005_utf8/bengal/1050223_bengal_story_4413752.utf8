 HC okays 6-yr-old?s evidence 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 22: The high court today upheld the decision of a Bankura court that sentenced a mother and son to life terms on the basis of a six-year-old girl?s testimony.

 ?The trail court has acted properly by taking the evidence of a six-year child for awarding life sentence to the accused. We are, therefore, upholding the decision...? a division bench of Justices A.K. Chakraborty and P.K. Deb said today. 

 In 1989, Sarbani Dutta, a mother of two ? Nandita, 10, and Nivedita, 6 ? at a Bankura village, apparently set herself afire. On the basis of a complaint lodged by her parents, police registered a murder case against her husband Sadhan Dutta and mother-in-law Radharani.

 After about 30 people were examined, the judge at the Bankura sessions court was told that Nivedita was witness to the incident. She was called. 

 In the court, the little girl overcame jitters to say her mother had indeed set herself on fire, but after ?my father and grandmother beat her up?. 

 After being convicted in 1995 for abetting the suicide, Sadhan and Radharani moved the high court. 

 Their lawyer Arup Chatterjee told the judges that life terms could not be handed on the basis of what a six-year-old had to say. The division bench did not agree.

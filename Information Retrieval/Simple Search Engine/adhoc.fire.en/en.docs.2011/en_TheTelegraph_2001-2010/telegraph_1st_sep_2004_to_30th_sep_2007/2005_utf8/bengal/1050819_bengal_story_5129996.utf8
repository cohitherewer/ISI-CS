 Child suicide over ball

 Krishnagar, Aug. 18: An eight-year-old boy last evening committed suicide over a cricket ball that cost Rs 8, reports our correspondent.

 Biplab Roy was playing at Hanskhali, about 70 km from Calcutta, with a ball belonging to elder brother Pradeep.

 On returning from school, Pradeep, a Class VI student, got annoyed on learning that Biplab had lost the ball.

 Arati, their mother, beat up Biplab in front of neighbours. He then went into a pesticides storeroom and consumed a full bottle, said Biswarup Ghosh, the Nadia additional superintendent of police.

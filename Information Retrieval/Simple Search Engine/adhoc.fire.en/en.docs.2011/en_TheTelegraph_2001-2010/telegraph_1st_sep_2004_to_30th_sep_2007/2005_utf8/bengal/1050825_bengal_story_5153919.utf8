 Notice issued to one-day teacher

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 24: He has been a teacher in Nadias Gohorpota Primary School for some time. But Basudeb Haldars students get to see him only once a month, the day he turns up to collect his salary.

 Haldar, also the local CPM gram panchayat pradhan, has been served a showcause and so has the headmaster of the school in Kaligunj in Nadia district, 140 km from Calcutta.

 Chairman of the district primary school council, Bibhas Biswas, also asked Haldar along with headmaster Wahed Ali to appear before an investigating committee tomorrow.

 The district administration got cracking after a group of around 1,000, comprising students and guardians, gheraoed the headmaster and four teachers, including Haldar, yesterday. They forced Haldar into the staff room around 2 pm and locked him up. They also demanded his resignation.

 The guardians said they did not even know that Haldar was a teacher in the school. We have never seen him teaching our children. We only know him as a political leader and the chief of our gram panchayat, said Sunil Saha, the father of a Class III student.

 They alleged that only a handful of teachers attend school regularly. Often our children return home early. When we ask them about it, they tell us that only two teachers were present and so the headmaster sent them home, said Anisur Rahaman, a grocer whose son studies in Class IV. 

 He said that when the headmaster was quizzed about this, he pleaded helplessness. A teacher can take leave according to the schools rules, the headmaster told us, Rahaman said.

 Haldar said it was not possible for him to manage both jobs.

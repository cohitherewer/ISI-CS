 Teacher dues after 36 years

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 7: The high court today asked the education department to pay pension to the widow of a teacher who died in 1992 after 23 years of retirement. Radha Rani Basu, now 82, is yet to receive the pension due to him.

 In his order, Justice A.K. Mitra asked the department to pay the arrears (nearly Rs 7 lakh) of Ramani Mohan Basu, who served in 17 schools before retiring in 1969, to his widow within eight weeks.

 The widow had moved the court after having failed to convince the education department about the validity of her claim. 

 In her petition, the resident of East Sinthi Road in Dum Dum said her husband had joined Basirhat High School in 1935 and took retirement from Amritalal Ojha Vidyabhawan at Dum Dum in 1969. 

 After his retirement, the schoolteacher moved pillar to posts for his pension and other benefits, but with no effect. In 1992, he passed away leaving behind his wife Radharani, a son and a daughter, the widows lawyer said.

 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, July 3: The Nadia sessions judge will tomorrow deliver the verdict in connection with the murder of Ranaghat subdivisional hospital surgeon Chandan Sen. 

 The death, two-and-a-half years ago, shook the state. Sen was found lifeless on a February night in a pond adjoining the house of Sunil Ganguly, a clerk working in his hospital. The surgeon had gone to attend a dinner hosted by Ganguly to mark his retirement. The body fished out bore 11 marks of injury. The post-mortem report said the death was a result of smothering by a plastic bag or a similar item. A doctor couple is among the accused.

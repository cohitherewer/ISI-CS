 Mother ready to send Gudiya back to dogs 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 12: After days of silence about the fate of her child, eight-year-old Gudiya?s mother Shanti Jacob told a crowded courtroom she will not hand over her daughter to any voluntary organisation.

 Shanti described the place in Agarpara where Gudiya worked as a domestic help as her ?uncle?s house? and took no heed of the fact that her daughter had been locked in the house with two Alsatian dogs, one of which mauled her.

 ?She had gone to her uncle?s place in Agarpara, where a mere accident occurred. This can happen to anybody and she is not a domestic help at all,? Shanti said in the Barrackpore court even as the judge and a crowd looked on.

 ?So will you send her back to her uncle?s place again?? subdivisional judicial magistrate Apurba Ghosh asked her mother. ?Yes, if required, I will send her back to the house,? said Shanti. ?Even if the dogs maul her again?? Shanti said: ?Yes, even then...?

 Left without little alternative but to direct police to hand over Gudiya to the family, Ghosh told Shanti she could take custody of her daughter.

 Earlier, representatives of Loreto Day School Sealdah approached Shanti with a proposal to adopt Gudiya. ?She would have found a home and a better life in the school, but things did not work out as we had hoped,? said Shukla Rebeiro, the school secretary.

 ?She (Shanti) was quite aggressive and did not like the fact that we had come to adopt the girl. Interestingly, Swapna Chanda (her employer) was there by her side,? said Shukla. Dejected with the way things unfolded, the school officials returned.

 Gudiya was mauled by two pet Alsatians on March 4 at Chanda?s Agarpara residence. Her 18-year-old son Sudip was also away when the incident occurred. Hearing wails, neighbours rushed in and took Gudiya to AMRI Hospital.

 At the hospital, doctors treated her for extensive injuries on her face, back and body. They also administered anti-rabies injections. In days, Gudiya became the cynosure of attention and nurses would come and play with her.

 Yesterday, police officers from Khardah in North 24-Parganas took custody of the girl.

 A day after, Gudiya left to live with her parents on a pavement in Howrah. 

 The AMRI authorities today decided to ?take care of Gudiya?s school education? and offer her a job in the hospital once she finishes studies.

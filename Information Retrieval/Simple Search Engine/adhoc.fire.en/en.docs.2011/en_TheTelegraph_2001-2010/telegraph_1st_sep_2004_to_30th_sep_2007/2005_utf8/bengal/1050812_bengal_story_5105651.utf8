 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Aug. 11: Trouble broke out at Suraksha Hospital in Salt Lake today because it handed over to relati-ves of a patient a death certificate that was backdated three months. 

 Gangadhar Chakraborty, 77, who was admitted to Suraksha earlier this month with nephrological problems, died this morning. His family took the certificate and went to the crematorium where the authorities refused to accept the paper. The relatives returned to the hospital and exploded in anger.

 Calcutta: The government will form a task force to finalise its plans of introducing health insurance for pregnant women, farm labourers and those in the unorganised sector. Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said it has been asked to submit a feasibility report.

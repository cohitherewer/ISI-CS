 Heat takes toll on life amp; crop

 OUR BUREAU

 June 17: The heat wave that scalded south Bengal yesterday and most of today has claimed 14 lives.

 Relief secretary Atanu Purakayastha said in Calcutta three heat stroke deaths were reported from Bankura, four from Burdwan and one from West Midnapore. 

 The number of deaths caused by heat this summer has gone up to 21, said an official.

 The delayed monsoon and the hot spell have already brought down the water table and an acute drinking water crisis has hit Purulia, Bankura, Burdwan and West Midnapore. We have alerted the district magistrates and asked them to arrange water in tankers wherever necessary, Purakayastha said.

 The Government Railway Police in Purulia said two beggars were among three killed at Rukni, Adra and Purulia stations. Three deaths were also reported from Birbhum. Sukumar Badyakar, a 45-year-old rickshaw-puller, died in Dubrajpur, 260 km from Calcutta. A 42-year-old employee of the Food Corporation of India, Rajgir Mahato, died of heat stroke at Suri and Ramani Mondal, of Ghurisha village in Ilambazar, collapsed to death while washing clothes in a pond.

 Agriculture department officials said farmers have been asked not to sow rice until monsoon arrives. Farmers who are still keen on sowing, have been told to keep some seeds away in case they need to sow again, agriculture director Dhabaleswar Konar said.

 A team of agriculture officials from Delhi met their counterparts at Writers Buildings. A state official said: We reported the situation to them. 

 The jute crop has suffered the most. It is nearing the time of harvesting and a lot of water is needed. Jute this year has been cultivated on 600,000 hectares. 

 An official at the Alipore Met office said: The monsoon reached north Bengal today. Normally, it should take four to five more days to hit south.

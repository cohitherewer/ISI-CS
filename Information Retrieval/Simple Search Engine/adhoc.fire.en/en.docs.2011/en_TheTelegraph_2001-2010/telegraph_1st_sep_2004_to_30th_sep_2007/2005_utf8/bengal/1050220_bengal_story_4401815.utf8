 Crunch curtain hangs on concert hall 

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 Calcutta, Feb. 19: Last month, Rabindra Bharati University authorities laid the foundation stone of its Sangeet Bhavan with much fanfare. Today, they are finding it difficult to go ahead with the construction of the Rs 2.36-crore University Grants Commission-sponsored project.

 The varsity had submitted the proposal to the UGC four years ago. However, by the time the project materialised early this year, the estimated construction cost is believed to have gone up to Rs 3.5 crore.

 University officials believe it will be virtually impossible for them to build a 60,000 sq ft concert hall as part of the project which is mandatory for getting the UGC money.

 ?It is not possible for us to set up such a huge concert hall with the latest acoustic and sitting arrangements with the meagre amount (Rs 2.36 crore) allotted to us. We can go ahead with the construction only if the UGC allows us to construct the building sans the concert hall,? said a senior RBU official. ?With Rs 2.36 crore, we can only raise the three-storey building, not the hall.?

 Vice-chancellor Bharati Mukherjee said: ?It might be difficult for us to fulfil the condition regarding the concert hall. I am planning to take up the issue with the UGC and intend to seek more funds to complete the project on time.?

 What is also worrying Rabindra Bharati is that the proposed scheme is entirely a central project and the university cannot approach the state to meet the deficit.

 The proposed building is expected to accommodate the fine arts and visual arts faculties. The fine arts faculty is now located at the university?s Jorasanko campus and the visual arts faculty on its BT Road premises.

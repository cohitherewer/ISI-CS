 Beijing bag of funds hope

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sen: Partly successful

 Calcutta, Nov. 16: A team of officials from the Chinese chambers of commerce will tour Bengal next year to gauge investment prospects in various sectors.

 On his return from a 10-day trip to China, commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen today said a joint working group, comprising members of the two governments and the chambers of commerce, will be constituted soon to identify sectors where collaborations are possible. China will also forward a list of interested visitors to Bengal, he said.

 Terming his trip partly successful, the minister said he found the Chinese eager to do business with Bengal.

 Our main objective was to see if despite being a giant in the manufacturing sector, China is thinking of investing overseas. Theyve told us they are ready to do business in some sectors, said Sen.

 According to the minister, the Chinese are interested in creating brand equity in some areas. 

 The Chinese are ready to offshore some items they export if they can get it done cheap from other countries. Were doing well in software, while China is a good manufacturer of computer hardware. If they find collaborating with Bengal profitable, then there are possibilities of joint venture in this sector, said Sen.

 Heavy equipment for building infrastructure is another area of potential collaboration that China is interested in, the minister said.

 Sen, who went to Shanghai and Beijing, described the Chinese infrastructure as mind-blowing.

 The Chinese are currently constructing a 32-km-long bridge to a port in Shanghai, Sen said, adding that the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government would seek technical expertise from China to build similar bridges. Bengal has only two ports, both of which are river-oriented, and face navigation constraints because of inadequate depth of water.

 However, the minister added, since this is the subject of the Centre, they will have to be involved. The deputy general manager of Calcutta Port Trust, who was travelling with us, has taken down relevant details of this project.

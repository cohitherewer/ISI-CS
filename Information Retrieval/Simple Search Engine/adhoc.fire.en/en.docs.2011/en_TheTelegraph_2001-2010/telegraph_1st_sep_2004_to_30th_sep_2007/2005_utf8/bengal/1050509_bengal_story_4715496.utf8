 BRIEFS

 Chinsurah, May 8: Two brothers were seriously injured trying to resist armed dacoits who raided four houses in a row early this morning at Paschim Sheikhpara in Mogra, Hooghly, about 60 km from Calcutta. 

 At the third house, the gang encountered Pradip and Dipak Adhikary, who were shot at and hit with sharp weapons. The dacoits looted cash and jewellery worth about Rs 1 lakh. Pradip had to be shifted to Medical College and Hospital, Calcutta, later. The Hooghly police chief said some people have been held for questioning.

 Midnapore: Water resource investigation and development minister Nanda Gopal Bhattacharya, a CPI leader, on Sunday accused a section of the CPM in Contai of fielding candidates against his party for the May 22 municipal polls in East Midnapore. The Left allies have had no seat-sharing pact for the elections to Contai and Tamluk civic bodies. 

 Calcutta: Jyoti Basu on Sunday said the CPM would finalise its list of candidates for the elections to Bidhannagar municipality in a couple of days. After a programme in Rajarhat, Basu, now a politburo member, said there were disputes over some seats and they would be sorted out soon.

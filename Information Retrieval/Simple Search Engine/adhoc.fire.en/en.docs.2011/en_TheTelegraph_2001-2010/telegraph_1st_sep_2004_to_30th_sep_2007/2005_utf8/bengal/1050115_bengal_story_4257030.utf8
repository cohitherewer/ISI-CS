 Work day with half the doctors 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Jan. 14: The health department today ordered an inquiry into the absence of doctors in Ghatal Subdivisional Hospital, detected almost by chance.

 That eight doctors out of about 15 were missing this morning came to light when family welfare commissioner Susanta Sen went for a ?routine inspection? around 10.30 am. 

 Seeing Sen, Nandita Pakhira, a deaf-mute housewife, complained with the help of a relative that a nurse who was about to administer the BCG vaccine to her newborn had declared the child dead. The maternity department claimed that it had handed a healthy baby to Nandita, who gave birth last Wednesday. 

 Moved by the sight of the tearful mother, Sen sent for the doctor under whom she was admitted. He could not be traced. Sen then sought the attendance register. Checking it, he found that eight doctors had not reported for work. 

 Sen asked hospital superintendent Sisir Das to seek explanations from the absentees. 

 Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee tonight said he has also sought a report from Das. ?We often get complaints about doctors and nurses not turning up. Many were penalised last year for unexplained absence. Now on, we will step up surprise visits to catch them,? he said.

 Emboldened by the effect of Nandita?s complaint, about 50 others in the Ghatal hospital told Sen that the doctors were frequently missing.

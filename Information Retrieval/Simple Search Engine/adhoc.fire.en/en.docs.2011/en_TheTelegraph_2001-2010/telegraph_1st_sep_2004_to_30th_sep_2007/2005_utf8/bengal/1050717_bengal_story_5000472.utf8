 Buddha says no to talks with Maoists

 OUR BUREAU

 July 16: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today ruled out holding talks with Maoists. 

 There is no question of holding a dialogue with those who believe in the politics of killing. They dont believe in democracy, they only resort to violence and murder, Bhattacharjee told a news conference at the Behrampore circuit house in Murshidabad this afternoon.

 The chief minister was on a days visit to the district to oversee the condition of areas affected by Padma erosion.

 Bhattacharjee made it clear that the government would take stern action against Maoists until they shun violence.

 Last week, state CPM secretary and politburo member Anil Biswas had said the government would not initiate a dialogue with the extremists if they continue to attack party workers and policemen. 

 A fresh contingent of 900 policemen was sent to three Naxalite-infested districts ? West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia ? today.

 Each district now has a special force comprising 300 trained police personnel and BSF jawans. The jungles will be combed with sophisticated gadgets like minesweepers, night vision binoculars and semi-automatic firearms, said a senior official of Purulia district police.

 The police are expecting another strike by the Maoists within a few days. The extremists will observe martyrs day ? remembering those killed in state-sponsored terrorism? in the last week of this month.

 This time, they may strike somewhere in West Midnapore. Belpahari is one of their prime targets. An alert message has been sent to all the police stations and we are in constant touch with Bankura and Purulia police, said a senior official working on the extremists activities in Bengal.

 Basudeb Acharya, the CPM MP from Purulia, expressed concern over the rising number of extremist strikes and said it is not a state matter alone. If police chase the Maoists away, they will take refuge in Jharkhand and disturb the state. I will raise the issue in Parliament, seeking the Centres intervention, he added.

 Leaflets against a CPM zonal committee secretary were distributed today at Kaichar under Manglakot police station in Burdwan, 180 km from the city. The leaflets allege misappropriation of government funds by the CPM leader.

 Though no Naxalite outfit has claimed responsibility, police think Maoists are behind the leaflets. 

 The leader in question, Duryadhon Sar, said he would talk to his party seniors.

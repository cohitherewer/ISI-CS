 Leather school in Tata hands

 Calcutta, March 18: The Tatas would take over the Institute of Leather Technology here.

 The chief minister today said in the Assembly: ?I have had a discussion with Ratan Tata, who agreed to take over the institute.? 

 ?Construction of the leather complex at Bantala is complete and work will soon start there. A number of tanneries and leather-based industries are coming up on the premises. In all, we are going forward in a big way in the leather sector. In this backdrop, several technologists and skilled workers are needed to cater to the industries and the leather technology institute will have to be improved,?? he added.

 The institute, which offers diploma and certificate courses in leather-related subjects, would be modernised after the takeover. 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said reputed companies from Italy are coming to the state in a big way to invest in leather. ?I had discussions with entrepreneurs in Italy and they were keen on the leather goods sector ? tanning and design.?

 When Opposition MLA Saugata Roy accused the government of slow progress in the industry front, Bhattacharjee asked him to visit the leather complex. ?Go there and see.?

 Officials in the commerce and industries department said the 1,100-acre leather complex ? of which 300 acres is tannery ? on the eastern fringes of the city is ready for a flag-off.

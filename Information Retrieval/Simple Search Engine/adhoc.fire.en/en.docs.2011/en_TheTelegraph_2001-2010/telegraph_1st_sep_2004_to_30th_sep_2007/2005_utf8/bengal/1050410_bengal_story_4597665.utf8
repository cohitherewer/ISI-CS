 Salt Lake arrest after lawyer assault 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 9: A city-based businessman was arrested early from Salt Lake?s CE block early this morning on charges of assaulting a lawyer and outraging the modesty of his woman colleague.

 Officers from the New Market police station picked up S. Chakraborty from his Salt Lake home. The businessman and his friends allegedly assaulted Jiban Chatterjee, an advocate of Calcutta High Court, and tried to pull out his female colleague from a car yesterday afternoon.

 ?I had only asked him to move his car a little further down the road as it was very awkwardly parked on Chowringhee Road. But he refused to listen,? said Chatterjee.

 At this, Chakraborty apparently abused the lawyer before rushing out to assault him. 

 Senior police officers on the case said Chatterjee?s junior colleague was not spared either. Chakraborty allegedly tried to drag her out. 

 ?The moment she cried for help, he panicked, saw people rushing towards him and fled in his car,? Chatterjee added.

 Later, the advocate lodged an FIR in the New Market police station and also gave the police the licence number of Chakraborty?s car. 

 The police scanned their records and found his Salt Lake address. 

 ?We mounted a raid and picked him up from his house. Chakraborty did not resist. He will be produced in court tomorrow,? said a senior officer. 

 The police are looking for his friends.

 Projects get poll push

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 26: The CPM has lined up an exercise to review pending projects in the state with an eye on the Assembly polls next year.

 The CPM brass has summoned zilla parishad sabhadhipatis, chairpersons of 72 municipalities under its control and leaders from districts for a series of meetings beginning tomorrow. 

 CPM insiders said the party is reluctant to invite any criticism from the Opposition on the issue of development.

 State CPM leaders, including chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, will meet the sabhadhipatis and senior district party leaders tomorrow. The party will hold a meeting with the civic body chairpersons on Friday. We will ask them (sabhadhipatis and civic body chairpersons) to strive towards completing the pending projects within six months, said a senior CPM leader.

 CPM sources said Bhattacharjee is expected to ask the zilla parishad chiefs to give him specific development proposals in their respective areas so that the government could work towards improving the quality of life.

 The chief minister is also expected to ask them (sabhadhipatis) to submit proposals regarding setting up industrial units in their areas. He wants the districts to come up with ideas, a senior state CPM leader said.

 The party also has a plan to meet its MLAs and MPs soon when its leadership is likely to ask them to provide financial support to civic bodies and panchayats from their local area development funds for completion of pending projects.

 Party insiders said apart from making attempts to complete the pending projects, the CPM is planning to announce some new projects before the elections are announced. We will not be able to do anything ? even announce a new project ? once the elections are announced. Naturally, we are planning to finalise some projects for the districts and start working on them, a party leader said.

 CPM state secretary Anil Biswas had said a few days ago that the party wanted both the urban and rural Bengal to prosper equally.

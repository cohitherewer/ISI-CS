 Alert after shower forecast

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Midnapore, Oct. 26: With the possibility of rains again in the next couple of days, the government today alerted authorities in the coastal districts even as the flood situation improved marginally in the state.

 The Met office today alerted us about a depression in the Bay of Bengal and rains. We, too, have issued a warning for the coastal districts, said finance minister Asim Dasgupta. 

 The death toll in the flood affected areas rose to 27 today with one more death in Patashpur area of East Midnapore.

 Three days before chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees visit to the flood-hit areas of East Midnapore, Mamata Banerjee today surveyed Contai and Egra in the district travelling by car and, at some places, taking a boat.

 For the last 29 years, the CPM-led government has spent crores in the name of reclaiming rivers and canals but nothing has been done, the Trinamul chief said.

 She also alleged political bias in the distribution of relief materials.

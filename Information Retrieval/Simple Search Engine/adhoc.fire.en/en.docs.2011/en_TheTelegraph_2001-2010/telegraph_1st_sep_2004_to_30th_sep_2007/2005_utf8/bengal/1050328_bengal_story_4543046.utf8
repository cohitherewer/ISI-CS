 Chopper vigil

 Krishnagar, March 27: Bengal?s 

 border with Bangladesh, vast stretches of which is riverine, 

 will be surveyed by choppers, the Border Security Force 

 has decided.

 The surveillance, which will begin with Nadia, Murshidabad and North 24-Parganas, underwent a trial today. BSF inspector-general R.K. Panchnanda and senior officials flew over much of the three districts in a Russian MI-17 helicopter.

 ?We will call in the helicopter from Saharanpur in Uttar Pradesh whenever we require it. This will help us watch the vast riverine border,? said R.C. Saxena, BSF deputy inspector-general of the Krishnagar sector.

 Chopper surveillance is already on in Tripura and Mizoram along the 4,100-km border with Bangladesh. Officials said it had become necessary as the BSF wanted to keep a stricter watch on the rivers to check infiltration and criminal activities along the border. 

 The Russian-made helicopter, procured a year ago, was chosen for its space ? it can accommodate 25 people ? and easy manoeuvrability. 

 Nadia district magistrate Rajesh Pandey said his administration will help the BSF find a parking place for the chopper. ?The idea of aerial surveillance along the border is good. This will help check infiltration to a great extent. We will cooperate with the BSF in every way,? he said.

 ?Three to four such helicopters had been procured to maintain surveillance along the India-Pakistan border in Kashmir and Rajasthan,? Saxena said. 

 The chopper was a success in Kashmir, an official said. ?So we think it will also help us keep watch on the eastern sector.?

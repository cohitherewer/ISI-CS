 Pirated textbooks 

 Calcutta, April 9: Acting on a complaint by the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education, the Enforcement Branch seized 20,000 pirated copies of arithmetic books meant for Class IX students.

 Sources said police raided a house on Bankim Street and arrested one Arjun Singh. Interrogating him, they raided a press at Panchannatolla and seized the books. The owner of the press, Abdul Rashid, has been arrested.

Power cuts

 Pockets of the city, particularly in the south, experienced power cuts this evening because of a 50-mw shortfall in the CESC grid. CESC sources said it was a result of a restriction imposed by the state power board on supply to the CESC.

 I-Day nerves put rebel zone on toes

 Policemen comb forests for Maoists

 Calcutta/Burdwan, Aug. 3: Police today cautioned against Maoist attacks on Independence Day as the rebels spread their net and put corrupt CPM leaders in their gunsight.

 Officials in the state Intelligence Branch (IB) said the state government has been alerted.

 Apart from their strongholds in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia, the rebels might target adjoining areas on August 15, they added. 

 Forest areas like Jhargram, Binpur, Belpaharai and Banspahari in West Midnapore, Bandwan in Purulia and Kanksa in Burdwan are in the danger zone. They have also prepared a roster of CPM functionaries who they think are corrupt. Most of their targets are the partys local and zonal committee secretaries. This time, the name of a CPM MLA on their strike list, said an officer.

 Biresh Mandal, the partys Kanksa zonal committee secretary, said: I know my name is on their hit list. But they will not be able to do anything. Though Maoists are spreading their organisational set-up in Burdwan, the people are with us. Informing police about their movement is our duty.

 The police, still in the dark about the routes used by the Maoists, have for the first time decided to install hidden cameras in the forests of West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia districts. 

 We have marked some areas along the Bengal-Jharkhand border which we know are their entry and exit routes. We will set up the cameras in the trees heavily camouflaged with leaves, said an officer.

 At a meeting in Calcutta on July 31, officers from the rebel-infested districts had alerted the special branch of Calcutta police about several most-wanted Maoists staying in the city. 

 The militants prefer the city for holding important meetings. Apart from this, a number of people are working in government offices who have a close link with the Maoists, an officer had warned.

 IB officials said the situation has become grimmer with a large number of CPM rebels, who were earlier attached to the partys local committees, recently joining the Maoists. Besides, some leaders who were part of the Naxalite movement in the 60s and 70s are now playing an active role in strengthening the organisation, said an officer.

 According to sources, a group of 60 tribals are camping in Kanksa forest. Maoist leaders are holding meetings and trying to convince poor villagers to join the organisation. A group of youths are also being trained in physical fitness.

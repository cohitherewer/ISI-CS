 BRIEFS

 Durgapur, May 2: A drive to ensure that phuchkas, chaats and cut fruits are sold in hygienic conditions around the National Institute of Technology here began today. 

 The move comes in the wake of an outbreak of suspected jaundice in the institute, formerly known as Regional Engineering College, last week. The NIT authorities were forced to suspend classes till July 1 after over 85 students took ill. A team of medical, administrative and civic officials collected samples of food sold in the area. ?We will have them tested. The vendors were told to keep the foodstuff clean and covered,? said subdivisional officer Osman Ghani.

 Chinsurah: The St Joseph?s Convent, Chandernagore, teacher accused of ?psychologically torturing? Tiyasa Biswas, the Class IX student who committed suicide, moved court for anticipatory bail on Monday. The public prosecutor said she was not taken into custody earlier as the court had accepted her ?not-to-arrest? plea.

 Calcutta: Italy will offer scholarships to 200 Indian students from this year. A delegation from the country revealed this during the signing of an agreement by the vice-chancellors of Calcutta, Jadavpur and Rabindra Bharati universities with the rectors of varsities in Rome, Naples, Venice and Turin. The pact involves exchange of faculties, books and library facilities and joint research.

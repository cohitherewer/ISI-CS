 Mamata fury at Subrata poll call

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Farakka, April 9: Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee today took strong exception to Calcutta mayor Subrata Mukherjee calling on Union water resources development minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi last night to discuss a possible electoral alliance with the state Congress for the elections to 82 municipalities and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

 ?There will be no seat-sharing with the Congress as long as it shares power with the CPM at the Centre, come what may,? she said in an informal meeting with her associates this afternoon. ?I am ready to snap ties with the NDA only if the Congress does not hobnob with the communists in Delhi to cling on to power,? she said.

 Mamata felt that Mukherjee, a key Trinamul leader, should not have gone to Das Munshi?s residence in south Calcutta and discussed seat adjustments with him. ?Subratada has incurred Didi?s wrath by overstepping his limits. He should not have called on Das Munshi,? said a senior Trinamul member.

 However, an undeterred Mukherjee reiterated hours before flying out of the city tonight that an electoral tie-up with the Congress is ?the need of the hour to prevent a division? in anti-CPM votes. ?People of Bengal want us to put up an united fight against the ruling CPM to ensure the latter?s electoral reverses,? the Trinamul leader said.

 Sources close to Mukherjee said he had already readied a ?concrete proposal? on Trinamul?s possible seat-sharing with the Congress.

 Mukherjee, they said, is toying with the idea of switching over to the Congress if Mamata remains firm on not forging an electoral tie up with the party. ?Subratada still keeps putting pressure on Mamata so that an electoral adjustment with the Congress is worked out,? said a Trinamul leader close to Mukherjee.

 Das Munshi said at Farakka, about 290 km from Calcutta, this morning that Mukherjee had met him last night and promised to work hard to persuade Mamata to form an effective electoral alliance with the Congress.

 ?People of Calcutta now want him (Subrata) to continue as mayor for the second time. The Trinamul Congress should honour this expectation and fight the elections jointly with the Congress to ensure the CPM?s defeat,? he had reportedly told Mukherjee. 

 Das Munshi and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee today attended a function at Khodabandpur village near Farakka to inaugurate a project to check erosion of the Padma river. Das Munshi spoke at length on a possible alliance with Trinamul, but the defence minister remained silent on this.

 BRIEFS

 Totopara (Alipurduar), Jan. 16: The primitive Totos are now the subject of genetic research.

 Three Anthropological Survey of India research officers have come here from Calcutta to collect 100 blood samples of unrelated tribe members. Studying the genetic history of the Totos is part of a larger effort to find the origins and preserve the DNA of 35 among the most primitive tribes of the country. 

 Calcutta: In the ravaged Andamans and south India, an Ananda Marg team is providing relief. A monk said 1,000 children will also be adopted.

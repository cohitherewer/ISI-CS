 Shooter jawan in net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, May 4: The BSF jawan who shot a woman yesterday at Ghojadanga near Bashirhat, about 100 km from Calcutta, was arrested today and placed under suspension. 

 A profusely bleeding Kiranbala Das, 32, succumbed to injuries at R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital last night.

 Around 2.30 pm yesterday, Praveen Kumar and a constable saw Kiranbala running towards the border and arrested her. When she tried to escape, Kumar pointed his service rifle at her and ?accidentally? pressed the trigger.

 The deputy inspector-general of BSF said ?preliminary investigation reveals that there was no harassment of the woman by the jawans, leave alone molestation?.

 Trouble erupted this morning when Das?s body was brought here from the hospital. People from nearly 15 villages went on the rampage damaging two vehicles, including a Maruti Gypsy belonging to the BSF. Some of them also tried to attack the BSF outpost but were stopped by jawans.

 A bandh was observed in all the 15 villages and shops and educational institutions were shut. Armed policemen have been camping there to ward off further violence.

 The state government reacted sharply to yesterday?s incident and registered its protest with BSF officials in Delhi. ?Our home secretary, Amit Kiran Deb, has already spoken to the BSF authorities,? chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said. 

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty visited the spot today.

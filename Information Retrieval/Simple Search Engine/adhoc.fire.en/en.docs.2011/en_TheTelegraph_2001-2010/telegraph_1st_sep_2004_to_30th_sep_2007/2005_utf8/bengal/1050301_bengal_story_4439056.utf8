 Teacher fury bleeds girl

 Barrackpore, Feb. 28: Aradhya Chatterjee, a Class VII student of a school on the northern fringes of the city, had to be taken to hospital today after a thrashing from a teacher against whom her father had complained. 

 The student of the state-run Vivekananda Seva Samiti Vidyalaya at Sodepur was injured in the ears and head. Around 9 this morning, Aradhya was taken to Panihati State General Hospital, from where she was released after her wounds were attended to. Later in the day, doctors suggested a scan of the brain after she vomited several times.

 Manoj Verma, the additional superintendent of police, Barrackpore, said Madhumita Taran, a geography teacher, slapped her several times. ?She wanted to know why her father, a member of the school managing committee, complained against her and some other teachers.?

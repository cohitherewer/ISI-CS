 Mamata sows land row seeds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 18: Mamata Banerjee today initiated a bid to stitch together the parties opposing the governments decision to hand over farmland in the two 24-Parganas to the Salim Group for industry.

 The Trinamul Congress would invite all partners of the Left Front ? barring, of course, the CPM ? and all Opposition leaders, including state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee, P.R. Das Munshi and former president Somen Mitra, to a meeting she has called on October 2.

 The meeting has on its agenda the modalities of the movement against the transfer of farmland.

 Besides the Congress and Mulayam Singhs Samajwadi Party, I shall personally invite the RSP, CPI, the Forward Bloc and other minor front leaders to attend the mass convention, Mamata told party functionaries this afternoon. 

 We believe that all those who are opposed to the CPMs disastrous decision to forcibly take away agricultural land for the Indonesia-based Salim Group to set up industrial units will participate in the convention, Mamata said later. 

 She will visit North 24-Parganas tomorrow to meet farmers who might be affected by of the conversion of land. 

 Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy said this is the first time Mamata has decided to bring all non-CPM forces under one platform to expose the communists calculated effort to deprive poor and marginal farmers of their farmland. This is just the beginning. We shall carry on with it till next years Assembly elections to isolate the communists from the poor.

 A political observer said Mamatas mass convention was as much a step to cement her own faction-ridden party as Opposition unity. Although Mamata is definite that none of the Left parties will participate in the convention, she will be successful in her mission if the Congress, the SUCI and the Samajwadi Party leaders join it. This may pave the way for a mahajot (grand alliance), said an analyst. 

 A section of the Congress, particularly those in the districts, feel they should participate in the meet. Mamata has invited all parties. Then why should we stay away? asked Shankar Singh, the newly-appointed Congress secretary and Nadia party chief.

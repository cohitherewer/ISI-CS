 Trip from wedding fatal on highway

 OUR BUREAU

 Burdwan/Krishnagar, Jan. 30: Two vehicles carrying people from weddings rammed into each other at Samudragarh in Burdwan early this morning killing six people.

 All the dead ? including a six-year-old and two teenagers ? were in a matador van that crashed into a mini-bus on the Saptagram-Tribeni-Kalna-Katwa highway, about 200 km from Calcutta. 

 Among the injured, admitted to Pratapnagar State General Hospital, 11 are said to be in a critical state. Many of them have multiple head injuries. The rest have broken limbs. 

 Those killed were identified as Pradip Biswas, 6, Archana Biswas, 16, Sandhya Biswas, 14, Kumud Sarkar, 30, Pintu Adhikary, 30, and Sharmila Sarkar, 21. 

 Around three this morning, the deafening crash woke up residents of Samudragarh, who rushed to the spot and pulled out the injured from the overturned matador van.

 A senior police officer who had rushed to the site said dense fog had made driving difficult. The drivers of the vehicles coming from opposite ends spotted danger late, but managed to escape the crash themselves. 

 The mini-bus driver fled. The police said he is absconding. The driver of the van suffered minor injuries and was released from the hospital after first-aid.

 A police officer said: ?There is a turn on the road and the mini-bus crashed into the belly of the van. The bus was sturdy enough to escape with minimum damage.?

 The police have seized both vehicles. 

 ?Preliminary investigations revealed that the drivers of both vehicles were travelling at great speed without taking into account the dense fog,? said Neeraj Kumar Singh, the district superintendent of police. 

 The police said the passengers in the matador van were relatives of Kamana Biswas and had come from Shantipur in Nadia to attend her wedding reception. Kamana was married to Swapan Biswas of Ghoshpara at Samudragarh. 

 Among the injured were Kamana?s mother Kalyani Biswas. 

 ?We were very tired and feeling drowsy. Most of us had dozed off when we heard the loud crash and felt a massive jolt. Our vehicle turned on its side and we fell on each other. I do not remember anything after that,? said Kalyani from her bed in Pratapnagar hospital.

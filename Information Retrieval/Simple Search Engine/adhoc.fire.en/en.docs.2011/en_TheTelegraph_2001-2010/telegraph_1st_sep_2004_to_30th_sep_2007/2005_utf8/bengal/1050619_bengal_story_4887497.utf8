 Rein on plastic

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, June 18: The Siliguri Municipal Corporation has decided to put a check on the manufacture, import and sale of plastic carrybags that are less than 20 microns thick, in the wake of the recent bovine epidemic.

 We want to make Siliguri plastic-free in a phasewise manner, mayor Bikash Ghosh said today.

 We will sit together on June 22 (with the 22 plastic carrybag manufacturing companies in and around Siliguri) and decide how plastic carrybags of less than 20 microns thickness can be removed from Siliguri, he said.

 We want to stop the spread of plastic from the source itself and stop all manufacture, import and sale of plastic that is less than the specified thickness, asserted the mayor.

 The Siliguri municipality and the animal resource directorate have revealed that more than 100 heads of cattle have died in the last month because of plastic consumption.

 Lakshmi Narayan Banerjee, the deputy director at the animal resource directorate, said bovine death due to plastic consumption has assumed epidemic proportions in the region.

 A two-member team from Calcutta conducted a survey on Wednesday and Thursday and prepared a report on the enormity of the animal epidemic.

 Another schoolgirl commits suicide

 Chandernagore, April 28: Rinki Chakraborty, a Class VIII student, doused herself in kerosene and set herself afire this morning. 

 She is the fifth schoolgirl to have committed suicide in Chanderngaore, about 50 km from Calcutta, this month.

 The student of Lalbagan Balika Vidyalay had feared poor marks in her annual examination, whose results were published later in the day. Rinki?s fears were not misplaced. Her father, Mintu Chakraborty, an employee of the Bhaba Atomic Research Centre at Salt Lake, said she was of average merit and had failed in the annual examination last year. ?This time, too, she did not expect to get pass marks?. We always tried to meet her demands?? he said.

 Tiyasa Biswas of St. Joseph?s Convent hanged herself in a classroom on April 6. Barnali Hazra, 17 and Maumita Das, 17, of Krishnabhabini Nari Shiksha Mandir and Mamata Ghosh, 14, of Narua Shiksha Mandir claimed their own lives after that.

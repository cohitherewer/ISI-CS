 Left rules out arrests

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov 30: The Left Front government will not go out of its way to arrest those whose names figure on the list of 72,000 people wanted in connection with criminal cases.

 The Election Commission (EC) had recently released a compact disc containing the names, including those of Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and her party MLAs Sougata Roy, Sonali Guha and Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay. 

 Asked if the Fronts decision would mean flouting the poll panels directive, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said: The commission has not asked the government to arrest anyone.

 We also oppose the ECs decision to delete the names of those who have been marked absconders by police.... Our nominee will meet chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon tomorrow and register our protest.

 CPM insiders feel that with Assembly elections round the corner, arrests of Trinamul leaders would give the Opposition a handle to mould public opinion against the government.

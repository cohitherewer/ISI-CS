 Rally full, office empty

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 19: Nearly a lakh employees of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government will skip office and march to Brigade Parade Grounds on December 28 to attend a rally of the CPM-controlled Co-ordination Committee. 

 Jyoti Prasad Basu, the secretary of the largest government employees body in Bengal, said members in the city would leave offices at 2 pm while those coming from outside will take a days leave. 

 Employees coming in procession from various corners of the city and Howrah and Sealdah stations are expected to disrupt traffic on that Wednesday. 

 We will try our best not to disrupt traffic, but why are you so worried about it? There have been many such rallies earlier and people have coped with them, Basu said. 

 Reminded that the government had submitted an affidavit in the high court saying rallyists would march in a single file without disrupting traffic, the union leader said: Even after it (the affidavit) was submitted, there has been a number of rallies and no one has uttered a word.

 In September 2003, Justice Amitava Lala had issued an order restricting rallies on city roads on weekdays. However, in October 2003, the government moved the division bench challenging the order and obtained a stay. 

 The police, however, assured the court that it would grant permission to organisations and political parties to hold rallies without disrupting traffic. 

 Co-ordination Committee leaders parried questions on whether a full working day would be wasted again. We will not flee office, we will only take leave, Basu said. 

 But bureaucrats at Writers Buildings felt that virtually no work will be done in government offices that day. 

 We expect very little work that day, said an official.

 Jyoti Basu will be among those who will address the rally to mark the unions golden jubilee.

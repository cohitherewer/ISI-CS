 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Nov. 19: A gang of three armed youths looted Rs 6,000 in a raid on a flat in Kasba.

 The youths entered the complex posing as salesmen. Two of them held retired bank employee Rathin Chatterjee and his wife at gunpoint, while the third kept watch outside the flat.

 Purulia: An attempt by Maoists to raid the Rajgram police camp in Bandwan failed on Friday night. A group of 200 CPI (Maoist) activists gathered near the camp of 60 policemen about 350 km from Calcutta. On being contacted, superintendent of police R. Shivkumar ordered to open fire if the Maoists were within range. Sensing that their plan might fail, the Maoists fled.

 Calcutta: An Air-India flight from Calcutta to London was delayed by several hours after a snag held up the aircraft in Delhi. The flight was rescheduled to leave Calcutta around midnight.

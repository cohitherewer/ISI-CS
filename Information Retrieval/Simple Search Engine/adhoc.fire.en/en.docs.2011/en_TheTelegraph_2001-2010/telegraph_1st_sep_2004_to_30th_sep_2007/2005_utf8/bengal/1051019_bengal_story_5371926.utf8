 Now, warrant against a Cong MP

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Oct. 18: The chief judicial magistrate here today issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Congress MP from Behrampore Adhir Chowdhury and his wife Arpita in connection with a twin murder this July.

 In the chargesheet submitted yesterday, the MP and his wife have been accused of engineering the murders of a father and son. 

 The magistrate, A.K. Pal, has also ordered the arrest of two others, known to be the MPs associates.

 We had sought the warrants. So, we will abide by the courts instruction. We will arrest them soon, Murshidabad superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh said.

 On July 23, a gang of five entered Nilufa Hotel in Behrampore town when it was about to close doors around 10.45 pm, and shot dead Hanif Sheikh, 48, and his son Laltoo. Hanifs younger brother Suroj fled through the backdoor of the eatery as a duo from the five brandished revolvers and took aim across the cash counter after finishing a dinner of mutton curry and bread. 

 Police said Hanif and Laltoo belonged to the anti-Chowdhury faction of the Congress. A dozen people were held after the murders, including Chowdhurys driver Gopal Sinha and friend Tapan Bose. A six-chamber revolver and 28 cartridges were found on Bose.

 The police interrogated Chowdhury and his wife in connection with the case on September 14.

 He left for Calcutta this morning. Contacted on his mobile phone, the MP, also the district Congress president, said he had been framed. The CPM is out to destroy the Congress in rural Bengal. Me and my wife have been framed by the police following instructions from CPM leaders. 

 Chowdhury said he was not Narayan Biswas and will not escape the law. Let the police arrest me when I return.

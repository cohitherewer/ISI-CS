 Dolphin count in tiger territory

 Calcutta, July 3: A census will be undertaken in the wilds of Sunderbans, but not in its forests. The number of dolphins in its waters, declared endangered, would now be counted. 

 The project will commence from December. A.K. Raha, the chief conservator of forests (south) and director, Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve, West Bengal, said: We chose December because the rivers remain calm then. The entire study will be conducted during the day as it is easier to locate dolphins then. 

 Experts had been brought in from Orissa to train forest personnel in south Bengal, more familiar with tiger tracking.

 In the neighbouring state, similar surveys had been conducted in Chilka, Raha said.

 For the census in the Matla, Muriganga and Thakuran rivers and their tributaries in the Sunderbans, small groups will set out on mechanised boats. As dolphins are not seen frequently, we have to carry out intensive searches. Our main target is to conduct direct search so that details can be obtained about their habitation, behaviour, life span and other related issues, a senior forest official said. 

 After the study, he added, it will be easier to ascertain in which areas the dolphins are maximum in number and how they are affected by the changes in local environment.

 In the Sunderbans, two dolphin varieties are common ? Gangetic and Irrawadi. Besides the riverine south Bengal, Irrawadi dolphins are seen in Malaysia, Indonesia and some Southeast Asian rivers.

 However, like the claims made in the tiger census are disputed, the dolphin study, too, is unlikely to be without the cloud of scepticism. We cannot claim that this census will give us the exact number of dolphins found. It is not possible in any wild life census ? but still an approximation can be reached for reference that can be used for planning in the future, said Raha. 

 Dolphins, some of whose species are known to be warm to human beings, are not easy to locate in the wild. Especially, in the maze of Sunderbans rivers. They also do not stay in groups, which makes keeping counts difficult, said a forest official.

 The number of tigers is ascertained by pug marks. Raha said: But in this case, there is no such means.

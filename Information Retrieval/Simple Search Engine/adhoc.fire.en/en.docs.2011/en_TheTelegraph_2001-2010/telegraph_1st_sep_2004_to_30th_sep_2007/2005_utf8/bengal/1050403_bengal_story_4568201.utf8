 Posta shooting trio in net

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 2: Police claimed a breakthrough in the daylight shooting case at Posta with the arrest of a trio.

 Five people ? the three held and two others who are absconding ? in their mid-20s, apparently came to Jagmohan Mullick Lane in the Burrabazar area together and shot at Pramod Kumar Sharma.

 The detectives, however, failed to track down the kingpin, Gopal Tiwari. ?We raided his hideout two minutes too late,? said a detective department officer. ?We stormed the room where he took refuge only to find his belongings on the floor.?

 Early on Wednesday, the gang arrived in a Hyundai Accent and shot at Sharma. He had a narrow escape as the bullet grazed his left thigh. ?Investigations have revealed the target was Pramod?s uncle Satyanarayan, a tea-stall owner. The assailants failed to identify him,? said an officer.

 The police had earlier picked up Pawan Kumar Sharma, a Basmati rice trader, from the Posta area for providing the vehicle to Tiwari and his men. Investigators have found close links between Tiwari and Pawan. Detective department deputy commissioner Gyanwant Singh said: ?A massive hunt is on for the missing duo.?

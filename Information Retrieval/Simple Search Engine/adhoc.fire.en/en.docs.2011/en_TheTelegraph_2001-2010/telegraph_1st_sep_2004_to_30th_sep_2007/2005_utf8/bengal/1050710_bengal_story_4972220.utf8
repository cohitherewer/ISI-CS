 Rs 100 cr for rural health

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, July 9: The government today unveiled plans, including upgradation of hospitals and recruitment of doctors, to improve healthcare across rural Bengal.

 The health department has allocated Rs 100 crore in the current budget for upgrading hospitals in remote villages, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said today. All rural hospitals would be upgraded in phases, he said. Though the programme has been initially launched in Bankura, Purulia, Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and East and West Midnapore, other districts will also be covered, the minister said.

 Mishra said Rs 22 crore out of the Rs 100 crore have been earmarked for regular maintenance of rural hospitals. But, henceforth, panchayat samitis will carry out the maintenance of block and primary health centres, he said.

 The number of beds in block and primary health centres would be increased, Mishra said. The 20-bed block health centres will be upgraded into 30-bed hospitals and the primary health centres, which have four beds each, will get six more.

 Mishra said more than 1,000 doctors would be recruited to man the 341 block and primary health centres in the state. We have already sent the list of vacancies to the West Bengal Public Service Commission for the recruitment of doctors, said the minister, who was here to inaugurate a subdivisional hospital at Domkol, 235 km from Calcutta.

 Five doctors will man a 30-bed block hospital, while two doctors will oversee a primary health centre round the clock. Doctors would be provided with good quarters so that they stay at the health centres, said the minister. Our primary aim is to ensure that doctors are stationed at the health centres to attend to the patients, he said.

 I have been told that doctors are sometimes not available in block and primary health centres. As a result, patients have to return without treatment. This has to stop at any cost, Mishra said.

 Boom, boom in bulging south 

 SANJAY MANDAL 

 Calcutta, Aug. 14: After the boom of sky-splitting highrises, the rush to grab the rising retail market.

 The flourish of housing projects along the EM Bypass has brought designer labels running to grab space at malls and shopping complexes springing up in south Calcutta. 

 A mall at Gariahat is all set to open its doors and several others are coming up ? at Gol Park, Dover Lane, Hazra Road and on the bypass.

 An estimated 50,000 people now live in the apartments on EM Bypass, between the Rashbehari Avenue extension connector and the Baghajatin level crossing ? a 3-km stretch.

 In the next few years, over a lakh people will live in the area and we will need more malls and commercial complexes to cater to them, housing minister Goutam Deb said. 

 According to estimates, the state housing board, Bengal Peerless, Bengal Shrachi, and some other developers will together build about 2,000 apartments in several highrises. 

 Stores like Westside and C-3 and brands such as Levis will be present in the Gariahat mall. The outlet on Camac Street serves the hub of the city and we wanted our second store near EM Bypass, the next potential hub, H. Chakraborty, general manager (marketing), Westside, said from Mumbai. The store will occupy two floors of the market.

 C-3, which has a footfall of over 2,000 a day at City Centre, will have its unit on 10,000 sq ft at Gariahat Mall. It is ideally located, said Rohan Ghosh, its chief of operations.

 We expect a footfall of 4,500 on weekdays and 11,000 on weekends, said Kishor Sanghani of Toplight Commercials, the developer of the Rs 30-crore market.

 Apart from the shopping area, it will also have an entertainment area, a roof-top food court and restaurant and basement parking facilities. 

 Chakraborty of Westside said talks were on with Bengal Peerless for its third unit at Axis, the mall set up by the housing company at New Town.

 Toplight is finalising plans for setting up a housing project with a multiplex and mall on the Rashbehari connector, near the bypass. Land has been acquired and details of the Rs 125-crore project are being worked out, an official said. 

 Although near completion, another shopping complex near Gariahat is facing problems. A PAM Constructions official said: The hawkers are obstructing our driveway and it is a serious problem.

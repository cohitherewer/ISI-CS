 Tortured housewife in bridge-suicide rerun

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 13: Less 

 than a day after a youth jumped to death from Vidyasagar 

 Setu, a 19-year-old housewife ? tortured and tormented by 

 her in-laws ? did a rerun from the bridge connecting Krishnagar 

 and Nabadwip.

 Residents of Nabadwip saw Soma Das climbing the iron railing of the bridge at 9 am. Soma dived into the river and drowned, said an elderly lady who had gone there to bathe.

 People bathing in the ghat recovered the body half-an-hour later, according to an official of the Nabadwip police station. Soma was then taken to the Nabadwip state general hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival.

 Soma married Tarak Das, a prosperous trader of Nabadwip, a year ago. She was allegedly tortured by her husband and in-laws as her parents had failed to give a colour television and a refrigerator as dowry.

 Somas mother, Minu Raj, a resident of Bethudahari in Nakashipara, claimed that her daughter was unable to bear the torture anymore and left her in-laws house around 7 am for the bridge, about 100 km from Calcutta.

 As the news of the suicide spread, angry residents of the area barged into the Das residence and dragged out Tarak, his father Nityananda, mother Uma and divorcee sister Purnima.

 The mob tied them to lampposts and started beating them up, holding the family responsible for the death of the young housewife. Later, personnel from the Nabadwip police station rushed to the spot and rescued Somas in-laws. All the four had been injured and were sent to hospital.

 Police later arrested Tarak, Nityananda, Uma and Purnima on receiving a formal complaint from Minu Raj. They were charged with torturing Soma and driving her to commit suicide.

 Nadia additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh said the girl apparently committed suicide after being unable to bear the torture. The girls family reportedly gave enough dowry at the time of marriage. But they could not stick to their promise of giving a television and a refrigerator. They used to press her hard to get the two from her mother and maternal uncle, said Ghosh.

 The police official said the girl protested and refused to comply with her in-laws relentless demand for dowry, leading to the torture.

 The in-laws family is so inhuman that they did not spare a girl even for two consumer goods. They have two stationery shops in Nabadwip town. But even after that they had to beg from the girls family, which is apparently not as well off, said Arati Saha, a neighbour.

 Microsoft no to unions

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 27: The day after the path-breaking CPM politburo meeting, Microsoft India chairman Ravi Venkatesan spelt out his anti-union stance at Writers Buildings.

 It is not clear how the formation of unions will help it (IT), said Venkatesan. 

 Microsoft India, in collaboration with the state government and Intel, today launched two programs at Writers ? Gyandeep and Gyanbridhi ?to accelerate IT penetration in Bengal.

 Gyandeep will enable government employees to buy PCs through flexible and affordable finance schemes while Gyanbridhi will offer students PCs at an extremely competitive cost and include educational curriculum of the school board and IIT and medical entrance tutorials. 

 Gyandeep will be available for an EMI of Rs 399, while for Gyanbridhi the EMI will be Rs 499, both through genuine Intel dealers.

 After meeting chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, Venkatesan added: The perspective of the state government and the transformation here is inspiring.

 A key focus of Microsoft India has been development through strategic partnerships and local alliances, e-governance, education and community growth. Our job is simple, we need to get people see the importance of computers. Affordability is a major issue that needs to be sorted out, said Venkatesan.

 Microsoft, he added, would be setting up an IT academy in Calcutta soon, with three more to come up in the districts, but has no immediate plans for a development centre. Calcutta, however, is on our radar, as the infrastructure conditions are favourable here, concluded Venkatesan.

 Maoists held

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Sept. 24: Police arrested Chandi Sarkar, a CPI(Maoist) state committee member, and six of his associates in the wee hours of today from a hideout at Chapra. 

 Sarkar, who used to oversee the Maoist organisation in Birbhum, Burdwan, Nadia and Murshidabad districts, was wanted in connection with five killings in Nadia during the last year, said the districts superintendent of police, R. Rajasekaran.

 Police, acting on a tip-off, raided the hideout ? about 140 km from Calcutta ? around 1.30 am today when the Maoist leader was closeted in a meeting with his six associates. A Pakistan-made pistol and ten rounds of cartridges were recovered from them.

 Rajasekaran said officials in plainclothes had surrounded Katgora village on the bank of the Jalangi river. When we were definite that Sarkar was discussing a party programme with his associates in one Najeem Sheikhs house, we raided it and arrested all six, he said.

 Undeterred by the arrest, Sarkar raised slogans while being taken to Rajasekarans office.

 Long live revolution and long live Naxalbari movement, the Maoist shouted in front of the media gathered there. Police are trying to silence us by arresting leaders like me. But they will not be successful, Sarkar said.

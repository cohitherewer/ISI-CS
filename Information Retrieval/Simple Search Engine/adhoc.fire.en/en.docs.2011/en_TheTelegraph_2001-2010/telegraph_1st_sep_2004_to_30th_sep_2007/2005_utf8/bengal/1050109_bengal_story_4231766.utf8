 Woman?s body found in tank

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Jan. 8: A pall of gloom descended on Gangtok after the army recovered the body of 29-year-old Indira Sharma, wife of a Sikkim Armed Police employee who was missing from her home since January 4.

 A post-mortem was conducted today on the body, which was dumped in an unused septic tank in the premises of the army?s 17 Mountain Division at Burtuk on the outskirts of Gangtok. Police sources said there were blunt injury marks on the head and other parts of the body.

 Preliminary investigations by the military police and the state police revealed that Sharma was allegedly killed by R.C. Garai, who works with the Electrical and Mechanical Engineering wing of the army and was stationed at Burtuk.

 Sharma was last seen at Burtuk with Garai and the tank in which the body was dumped is next to Garai?s room, which also had bloodstains all over the floor when army personnel broke in.

Sharma?s family members said that the mother of two 

had left home on January 4 to get some provisions. ?She must have been lured into 

the army area by the man on the pretext of making provisions available at cheaper 

rates from the army canteen,? said the victim?s neighbour.

 Teach em young to live with tiger

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Wanted, saviour: The mangroves of Sunderbans 

 Calcutta, Aug. 17: Catch em young and watch them grow eco-friendly.

 The forest department, along with a handful of non-government organisations working to preserve wildlife, has decided to educate children living on the fringes of the Sunderban Tiger Reserve (STR) about the importance of conservation of nature.

 The department has launched a pilot project with students from 10 schools.

 These children live in constant conflict with nature. Since childhood, they watch their elders poach deer and collect tiger prawn seedlings to earn a living. What they dont realise is that, slowly over time, these activities disturb the balance of the eco-system irreversibly, said Pradeep Vyas, the STRs conservator of forests and field director.

 We realised that to make long-term conservation possible, we had to educate these children and inculcate the value of conservation in them right from the beginning, he added.

 As part of the project ? named Nature Education Programme for Conservation of Mangrove ? nature clubs have been formed in these schools. Forest officials are also taking the children on a tour of the tiger reserve and teaching them why the big cats and mangroves need to be conserved.

 Realising that there is no Bengali textbook on the Sunderbans in the syllabi followed in these schools, the forest department has published Sunderbaner Sundar Sundari, which talks about conservation in the form of a series of simple stories. 

 We are teaching them to conserve everything ? the jungle, the water, the rest of the animals, in short, our survival, said Vyas. 

 However, due to moderate manpower, the programme is limited only to a few fringe areas like Rajatjubilee, Dayapur, Pakhiralaya and is being taught to students of classes IV to VII only. Moreover, it is not a day-to-day programme.

 The forest department and the NGOs have trained teachers in these schools and conduct a time-to-time assessment of the implementation of the project. They also arrange regular visits for children to the STR ? this winter, 500 students will be taken on the tour.

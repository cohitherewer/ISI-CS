 Calcutta, March 19: The Centre has promised to accord priority to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s dream project, the East-West Metro, for funds allocation under the National Urban Renewal Mission once a concrete proposal is submitted.

 ?We will definitely look into the project details and try to expedite allocations under the mission once a comprehensive report is made available to us. When the finance minister referred to projects in other cities, he used those as examples,? Ghulam Nabi Azad clarified in Calcutta today.

 The Union minister for parliamentary affairs and urban development was speaking at the inauguration of Utsa The Condoville, a housing project in New Town, Rajarhat, by Bengal Ambuja Housing Development Limited and the West Bengal Housing Board.

 Bhattacharjee, who met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in the capital today, said his government was keen to construct an elevated mass rapid transit system for Calcutta with Japanese funds. Bhattacharjee said this could be taken up during the upcoming visit of the Japanese premier as it is ?top on our priority?, according to a PTI report from Delhi.

 Azad, who shared the podium at Rajarhat with Bengal housing minister Gautam Deb, also made it clear that Calcutta was ?certainly included? in the list of seven megacities that come under the Rs 5,500-crore cover of the mission set up to augment urban development.

 ?Bengal has always shown the way with its innovative housing programmes and the unique public-private partnership model could be followed elsewhere as well,? said the Union minister, adding that New Town, Rajarhat, may become ?a trendsetter?.

 Earlier, Deb underlined the need to develop satellite ?greenfield cities? to ease the pressure on existing metropolises. ?The size of the urban population will soon increase from the present 28 per cent to 40 per cent, resulting in a severe strain on the infrastructure of big cities. In this scenario, New Town, which can hold a population of 20 lakh, is a huge boon,? he said.

 Deb admitted there could be some ?teething problems? for inhabitants moving into the new township, but promised that all efforts were being made to ?synchronise essential services?. A temporary bus service was being put in place for New Town-based commuters.

 Azad also laid the foundation stone for another joint sector housing project by the Bengal housing board ? Ujjwala The Condoville ? in New Town. He urged the state government to carry forward its joint-sector initiative to counter the housing shortage. ?The partnership model can also be utilised for providing essential services,? he said.

 ?Ujjwala will follow the same cross-subsidy maxim and we have again tried to offer a basket of home-plus features that marked our maiden project, Udayan The Condoville,? said Bengal Ambuja managing director Harsh Neotia.

 The low-income group and middle-income group sections will have a fully-equipped resident activity centre with a gymnasium, reading room, cr?che, community hall and lap-pool. The luxury apartments will boast lifestyle features like garden duplexes, penthouses, terrace combos and a sky court ? ?a first in the city?.

 Santiniketan: Peace stolen

 Calcutta/Santiniketan, April 24: The Centre has issued a notice to the Visva-Bharati asking it to prepare a list of employees and details of their relatives living abroad. 

 The move was initiated after the CBI, which is probing the theft of Tagore?s Nobel medal and other memorabilia from the Rabindra Bhavan museum last year, submitted a report saying someone living abroad and having close links with Visva-Bharati insiders may have masterminded the heist.

 Delhi has directed the university authorities to submit the list at the earliest. 

 The circular from the human resource development ministry reached Visva-Bharati early this week. ?We have received the circular and it has been forwarded to all the departments,? said registrar Sunil Kumar Sarkar.

 Visva-Bharati has about 4,000 employees. The circular puts all of them under the CBI scanner.

 Early this month, sleuths working on the heist sought the Centre?s direct intervention for the list of relatives. ?In our report, we told the Union government to ask the varsity authorities to provide details of their staff?s relatives residing in foreign countries. Besides, we sought the names of the relatives staying outside Bengal,? a CBI official said. 

 After a year?s effort to trace Tagore?s memorabilia proved futile, the sleuths are now focusing on the movement of the Visva-Bharati employees and their relatives. 

 ?The leads point to an intelligent man who stays abroad,? said an officer, adding: ?It appears the mastermind plotted the crime using a chain comprising Visva-Bharati insiders and criminals active in Bolpur and its vicinity.?

 The CBI has also sought details of the staff who went on foreign trips before or after the heist. ?After getting the lists, we will seek Interpol?s help to find out how many of them returned to the country recently and what the purpose of their visit was,? said an official.

 A number of CBI teams are camping in Bihar, Goa, Kalimpong and Hyderabad in search of the Nobel medal. 

 Left red in the face after the burglary last year and the detection of a museum guard snoring on duty recently, the Visva-Bharati authorities are keen to fill up the showcases where the stolen articles used to be displayed. The deadline for the task has been set for May 9 ? Baisakh 25 in the Bengali calendar ?Tagore?s birthday. 

 A gold duplicate of the Nobel medal and its bronze replica, provided by the Swedish Academy, are now in Delhi. ?We have requested the Centre to send them before Rabindranath?s birth anniversary. We are awaiting a response,? said the registrar.

 On to US with 9/11 scrolls 

 - MAYHEM REPLACES MYTHOLOGY ON PATAS

 NARESH JANA

 Ranis pata chitra depicting the attack on World Trade Center

 Naya (West Midnapore), Oct. 2: Rani, Swarna and Monimala, three artists from this remote village in West Midnapore, who never attended a drawing class, flew off to the US today.

 Instead of the mythological stories handed down by their elders, the trio ? all Chitrakar (painter) by vocation and in their surnames ? depicted in pata chitras the horror of planes crashing into two towering buildings in faraway America. 

 Their expression of angst and pain, shared with millions across the globe or in worlds alien to the village 130 km from Calcutta, roused the interests of two universities in Boston ? Brown and Wesleyan.

 Rani, Swarna and Monimala would travel to the superpower nation shaken by 9/11 with their collection of artwork on scrolls and ballads narrating the terror. 

 Ironically, most scroll artists, like Rani, are Muslims, who excel in telling Hindu mythological stories. Our art is steeped in Hindu myths and characters ? Ramayana, Mahabharata?. 

 We took Hindu names so that we get an identity in tune with our creation, said Rani, who started painting patas at the age of eight. She is 45 now. 

 Rani is taking with her a 12-foot-long, 2-foot wide scroll to the US. The painting, divided in 10 segments, tell the story of the twin strikes by Islamic fundamentalists.

 Only a few years ago, we used to beg on the streets with our songs and scrolls. People would distrust and hate us. If a house where we had begged was robbed, residents would put the blame on us, said Ranis husband Shyam Sundar Chitrakar. 

 Things started changing with the turn of the last century, said Shyam Sundar, sitting in a courtyard in the sleepy village. With an increased art consciousness, scroll paintings started gaining popularity. 

 Rani, Monimala and Swarna, struggling hard to keep the dying art going, visited the UK and Scotland with their paintings in 2001 and 2003.

 We never use chemical colours in our scrolls, but stick to vegetable dyes made from lime, betel and neem leaves, dopati, jaba (china rose) and other flowers, said Rani. 

 There are some 60 pata painters at Naya, who draw inspiration from Ranis courage and tenacity.

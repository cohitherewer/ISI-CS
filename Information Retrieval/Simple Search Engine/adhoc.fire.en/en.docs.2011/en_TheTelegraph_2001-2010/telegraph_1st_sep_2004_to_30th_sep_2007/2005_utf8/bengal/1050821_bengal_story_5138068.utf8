 Molest charge on CEO

 Calcutta, Aug. 20: A woman, who came from Mumbai for a job interview, has charged the chief executive officer of a private company with molestation. 

 The woman had come to the computer training-cum-recruitment agency in Salt Lakes AE block this afternoon for the interview, police said. 

 When she entered the CEOs room, he allegedly tried to molest her but she escaped, the police said. 

 Accompanied by a friend, the woman went to Bidhannagar (North) police station and filed a written complaint. She told the police that after trying to molest her, the man left the office.

 We are looking for the CEO and have brought over some employees of the company for interrogation. However, the charges brought by the women are also being verified and we are cross-examining her, a police officer said. 

 According to the police, the employees of the company during interrogation rubbished the womans accusation as baseless. 

 They claimed that the CEO was not in the office when the lady came for the interview. But we are investigating further, an officer said. 

 The police added that this is not the first time the CEO has come under a cloud. A warrant had earlier been issued against him in a forgery case filed against the company.

 Power snaps, patients suffer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Purulia, June 29: Runu Bala Mahato has burn injuries all over her feet. But the Purulia Sadar Hospital gave the 55-year-old little relief as it plunged into darkness today, leaving her writhing in pain since morning.

 A power failure in the hospital, with over 500 patients, had the authorities in a fix as surgeries had to be deferred and important examinations cancelled.

 Hospital officials said the problem was compounded by the breakdown of its heavy-duty generator. Only a small generator kept the unit for the newborns going.

 Normal work was severely disrupted since 9 am, said deputy superintendent of the hospital Suparna Roy.

 Engineers of the Public Works Department (PWD) were of no help. We have no mechanical staff in Purulia. We have to bring them from Burdwan, said sub-assistant engineer Apurba Das. We expect to restore normal power supply by tomorrow.

 The power cut was caused by a cable fault in the hospital and none of the machines, including those for X-ray, ECG and ultra-sonography, could be operated.

 Kalyan Chakraborty, 63, in the hospital with a fractured leg, had to be carried to a private clinic for an X-ray. Because of the power failure, the lifts at the hospital were not working. I had to take my brother out in a stretcher in the heavy rain, said his son Kanai.

 Employees tried to start the hospitals 63-KV generator, but in vain. It finally whirred to life around 4 pm. It is a matter of shame that the generator could not be started immediately after the power failure. As a result, so many patients suffered. I have sought a report from the hospital superintendent, director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee said from Calcutta.

 We have purchased 12 packets of candles. If the generator breaks down again, we will distribute the candles to all the wards, said a hospital employee.

 Health officials said todays fiasco has brought to light the PWDs laidback attitude.

 EC nudge to police shuffle

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 24: A major shuffle in the police ranks is in the pipeline in the run-up to the Assembly polls.

 The shuffle follows a directive from the Election Commission (EC) to transfer police officers from the rank of inspector-general to sub-inspector who have served three years or more in a district. Officials posted in their home district will also have to be transferred.

 The matter was discussed today at a meeting chaired by director-general of police S.C. Avasthy. 

 All superintendents of police and other senior officers attended the meeting at Writers Buildings.

 Officials said the order would mainly affect the middle ranks of the police ? largely comprising sub-inspectors and inspectors ? as they mostly stay in one district for the longest period. 

 According to an estimate drawn up at the meeting, about 70 to 90 per cent of officers in every district fall in this category.

 The EC has set January 19 as the deadline to carry out these transfers. The logic is that those transferred should be able to settle down in the new area well before the polls, said a senior officer present at the meeting.

 However, officials are not sure if police officers in Calcutta will be exempted. Usually the state capital is exempt from such transfers. But, weve sought a clarification from the EC, said chief electoral officer Debashish Sen.

 Avasthy also told the SPs to furnish weekly reports on execution of arrest warrants as directed by the poll panel. 

 In addition to the 72,000 cases of non-bailable warrants, the EC also wants to keep track of fresh warrants issued and their execution, said an official.

 This is the first time the poll panel has sought regular reports. Officials see this as the commissions way to build pressure on the government to monitor the law-and-order situation better.

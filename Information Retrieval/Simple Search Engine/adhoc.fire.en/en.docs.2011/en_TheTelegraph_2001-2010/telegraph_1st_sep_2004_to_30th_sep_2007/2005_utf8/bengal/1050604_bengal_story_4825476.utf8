 Curtains for seven state units

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 3: The government today announced the closure of seven units, including Tantushree and Charmaja. 

 Around 1,600 employees of the loss-making units would be rendered jobless following the decision. The government would offer early retirement schemes, which would require about Rs 70 crore, to the employees with funds from UKs department for international development (DFID).

 At Writers Buildings, Bangshagopal Chowdhury, the minister for small-scale and cottage industries, which controlled the units, named the seven. Besides Tantushree and Charmaja, Pulver Ash, Ganges Printing Ink, Electronic Test and Development Centre and West Bengal Ceramic Development Corporation will be closed. 

 They have hit the point of no return. We will not run them any more. We are calculating the dues of the employees. It is expected to be over in six months, the minister said. 

 The government will try to run Mayurakshi Cotton Mill as a joint venture. If unsuccessful, it would also meet with the same fate. 

 Chowdhury also said: We are planning ways to utilise the assets and brand names of some of the companies.

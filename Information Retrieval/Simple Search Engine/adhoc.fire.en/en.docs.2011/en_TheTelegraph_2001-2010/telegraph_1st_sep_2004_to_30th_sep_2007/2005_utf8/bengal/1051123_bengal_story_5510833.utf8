Behrampore, Nov. 22: Clad in a sari that had seen better days, Manju Bewa hobbled along Musalmanpara towards her mothers house, about 100 metres away. 

 From a distance, Congress workers could be heard shouting slogans in front of the sadar hospital against their leaders arrest. Murderer, Manju mumbled. 

 Adhir Chowdhury is in jail in connection with her husband and sons murders. 

 Hanif Sheikh, 48, and Laltoo, 25, were shot dead in their little eatery in the town, their only source of sustenance. The killers had a bread-and-mutton-curry meal before taking aim at the father and son across the cash counter at Nilufa Hotel. 

 Hanifs brother Suraj fled as the shooting started. He later lodged an FIR naming 14 people. Suraj, who lives separately, works in a factory near Delhi.

 July 23, 10.45 pm has changed several lives. 

 The roof over one of two rooms in Hanifs single-storey house caved in during the rains, but Manju cannot afford to repair it. The family now sleeps at night huddled together in the other room.

 Four months after the double murder, Manju, her teenage daughters Shabana and Rumi, and youngest son Tipu, 13, are on the verge of starvation. 

 Neighbours feed them sometimes and so does Manjus mother Anjura Bibi.

 Shabana, 15, has almost lost her mental balance. She often goes into fits and shrieks abba esheychhey, bhat khabey (dad has come, he will have rice). We pour water on her head to calm her, said her elder sister Rumi, 17. The sisters had dropped out of school after Class IV.

 Manju gets angry whenever Chowdhury is named. Adhir Chowdhury and his wife have engineered the murders. Now he is getting VIP treatment in jail and I am facing a bleak future?. 

 Manju and her daughters are worried about Tipu, a Class VII student of Seva Milani High School. He has stopped going to school, for fear. 

 I do not know how I will continue his education, said Manju.

 Laltoo was married and had a daughter. But I could not keep them with me. What would I feed them? Now his wife stays with her father, Manju said.

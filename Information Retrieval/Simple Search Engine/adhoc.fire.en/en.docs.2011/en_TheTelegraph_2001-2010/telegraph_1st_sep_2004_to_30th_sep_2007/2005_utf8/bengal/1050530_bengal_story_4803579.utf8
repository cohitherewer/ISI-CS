 Teacher lash leaves 14 hurt 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Raiganj, May 29: Fourteen students of Chalan Primary School in Itahar got a taste of their stop-gap teachers temper yesterday when they were caught talking in class.

 While 11 of them were released after being administered first-aid at North Dinajpur district hospital, three ? Bhagirath Sarkar (Class III), Bikram Sarkar (Class II) and Premnath Sarkar (Class IV) ? are bedridden, nursing swollen hands and legs.

 Known for his violent ways of disciplining children, Radheshyam Sarkar had filled in for Parthasarathi Mitra, a CPM member of Itahar panchayat samiti who preferred to pursue his political aspirations during school hours.

 Sarkar, who does not even have a school final degree (the minimum qualification for a primary school teacher), is paid Rs 1,000 every month.

 Students of the school, some 25 km from the town, said Sarkar was in the habit of thrashing them on the slightest pretext.

 My friends and I were chatting in a classroom after we were told that the midday meal would be served in a few minutes. Suddenly, Sir entered the room, hauled us up and began beating us mercilessly, said Bikram.

 His swollen face and hands bore testimony to the assault.

 Premnath said Sarkar had threatened the boys with another dose of disciplining if they went back home and complained to their parents.

 Mitra said Radheshyam had been engaged in the school since it did not have adequate number of teachers. It is not true that he filled in for me, he said.

 Sarkar, on the other hand, said: Parthada had asked me to do his work as he remains busy with panchayat work. He comes to the school twice or thrice a month to sign the attendance register and draw his salary.

 He also admitted that he had beaten up some students, but said it was not because they were chatting in class.

 They had not prepared their lessons properly and that is what angered me, he said.

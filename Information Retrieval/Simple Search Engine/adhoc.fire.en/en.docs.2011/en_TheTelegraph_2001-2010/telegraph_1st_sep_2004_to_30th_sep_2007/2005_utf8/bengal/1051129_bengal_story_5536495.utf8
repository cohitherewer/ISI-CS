 Israeli tycoon jets in with investment hope

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 28: After the huge investment proposal from the Salim Group of Indonesia, an Israeli company has expressed interest in setting up a biotechnology park and a medical equipment factory in Bengal.

 The head of The Europe Israel Group of Companies met finance minister Asim Dasgupta to discuss plans worth Rs 10,000 crore while chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was busy propounding the virtues of globalisation in Delhi (report in Business Telegraph). 

 Moti Zisser, the chairman of the company, landed in Calcutta in his private jet yesterday, met Dasgupta and took a round of the city before leaving this afternoon.

 I have invested in many cities across the globe and I can feel the pulse if business will happen. I feel there is a lot of enthusiasm here, Zisser said. Two of his executives stayed back in the city to finalise proposals for the biotech park that will require 100 acres.

 The group also plans to set up a factory to manufacture medical equipment ?one of its kind in the world ? that uses MRI-guided technology for critical surgery by non-invasive method.

 In the first phase, the investment could be $200 million, or about Rs 1,000 crore.

 The group is considering some other locations like Hong Kong and China, too, for the factory. It now depends upon the government here to facilitate things and get the investment here, said Indrajit De, a US-based NRI, instrumental in bringing the Israeli company here.

 With a turnover of $2 billion, the company has operations in Asia, Europe, Africa and the US. It has interests in medical imaging, medical instrumentation, stem cell research, IT, telecommunications, hotels, malls, entertainment and commercial centres. It also specialises in developing seafronts, riverfronts and harbours. 

 When we invest in some place, we look to bring the entire range of business portfolio there, Zisser added.

 Calcuttas riverfront and heritage buildings have caught the imagination of the Israeli team. However, there are no firm proposals at this point except that Zisser believes the city provides great opportunity in retail and entertainment.

 Calcutta needs huge retail and entertainment complexes, he said.

 While these could take some time to bear fruit as foreign investment in retail is still a far cry, the biotech park and the medical equipment factory could take shape if the government provides land. 

 The Israeli company has had a bad start in the state, losing the bid for the international convention centre at Rajarhat it made jointly with Laxmi Realtor even after making the highest financial offer. The consortium has moved court challenging the award.

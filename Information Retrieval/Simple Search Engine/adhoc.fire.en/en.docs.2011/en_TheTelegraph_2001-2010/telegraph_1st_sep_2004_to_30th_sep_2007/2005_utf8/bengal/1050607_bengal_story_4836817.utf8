 Teacher told to surrender 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 6: The anticipatory bail plea of Tiyasa Biswass class teacher, who was accused by her parents of driving the Class IX student to suicide, was rejected by the high court today.

 Basabi Barat has to surrender immediately, said the division bench of Justices Amit Talukdar and S.P. Mitra. 

 Tiyasa, a student of St Josephs Convent, Chandernagore, hanged herself in a classroom on April 6 when her friends went out for morning prayers. Her parents had alleged that Barat was biased against Tiyasa for not taking tuition from her. The teacher moved the application for anticipatory bail after Tiyasas father Harasit, a doctor, lodged a complaint with the Chinsurah police station holding her responsible for his daughters death. 

 Harasit alleged that Barat ill-treated Tiyasa regularly. We were aware of it and had decided to move her to another school, but she was sure that her Class VIII teacher would not continue in Class IX. After promotion, she found Barat was again her class teacher.

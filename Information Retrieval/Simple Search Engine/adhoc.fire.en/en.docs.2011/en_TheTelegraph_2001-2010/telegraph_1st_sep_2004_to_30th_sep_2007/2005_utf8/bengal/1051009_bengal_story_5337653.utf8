 Metro trapped in tunnel for 30 minutes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 8: Passengers of a Tollygunge-bound Metro were stuck between Esplanade and Park Street for about half an hour today and left to panic in overcrowded compartments. 

 The train, carrying hundreds of people ? many of them puja shoppers or early pandal hoppers ? left Dum Dum at 3.50 pm. It ran smoothly till Esplanade. 

 However, moments after leaving Esplanade, the train came to a screeching halt and was stranded there from around 4 pm to 4.32. 

 There was some technical problem for which it could not move. Later, the driver and the guard managed to take the train to Park Street station, where the passengers were evacuated, a Metro spokesperson said. 

 He added that none of the passengers fell ill. 

 The empty train was taken to the Tollygunge yard for repairs. 

 We were wondering why the train stopped but there was no way we could have known what was going on, said Tapas Dutta, who had boarded the train at Shyambazar and was going to Kalighat. Our coach was overcrowded. It was suffocating inside, he said.

 There was no announcement in the train and we panicked. Theories began doing the rounds, said Tapan Roy, another passenger. 

 The authorities, however, claimed that there was no discomfort for the passengers as the fans were working. 

 Children were feeling stifled and several of them were complaining, said one of the passengers. 

 It seemed that we were stuck inside the tunnel for hours. I will never forget this nightmare, said Anindita Sanyal, who was travelling with her three-year-old son Prayas. We were confused and panic-stricken as we did not know whether the train would move at all, she said.

 Smita Kulkarni, a north Calcutta resident, said she felt a flood of relief when the train finally made it to Park Street station.

 To accommodate the rush, Metro trains were run at eight-minute intervals instead of 10, officials said. No trains were cancelled.

 Madan Mitra, the president of the Metro Railway Workers Congress, demanded a high-level probe into the incident. The authori- ties must ensure the safety of passengers. The rakes are not maintained properly and not checked before operation, Mitra said. 

 However, officials denied that there was any negligence. Inspections are conducted regularly and snags like this can happen, said an official. He ruled out a probe.

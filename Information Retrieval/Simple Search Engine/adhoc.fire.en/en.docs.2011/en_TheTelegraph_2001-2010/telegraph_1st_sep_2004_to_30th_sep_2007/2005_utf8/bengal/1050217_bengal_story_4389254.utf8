 Probe and arrest after snatch sloth blame

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Krishnagar, Feb. 16: Jolted by criticism that personnel of Haringhata police station were lackadaisical in tracing a kidnapped 13-year-old girl despite being provided with leads by her father, Nadia police arrested one man in connection with the abduction even as their chief ordered a probe. 

 Superintendent Benoy Chakraborty today set up an inquiry committee led by additional superintendent Biswarup Ghosh to find out why the Haringhata officials did not take steps after Shahabuddin Mondal reported his daughter missing on February 3. 

 ?The additional SP will carry out a detailed probe to find out whether the policemen at Haringhata behaved irresponsibly as alleged by Shahabuddin. He will submit a report to me soon. I will not spare anyone found shirking his duty,? said Chakraborty. 

 In a sudden display of alacrity, the force arrested Naju Mondal, a resident of Haringhata, about 55 km from Calcutta, from Amdanga in North 24-Parganas early this morning. 

 The principal accused in the kidnap case, Salem Mondal, is still at large. The police are also looking for two women, Sabana Khatun and Puti Bibi. ?A hunt is on to nab all of Salem?s gang members. We are confident of busting the racket,? Chakraborty said. 

 Shahabuddin?s daughter, a Class VI student, went missing while returning from school on February 2. Shahabuddin was tipped off by fellow villagers of Kastodanga in Haringhata that Salem?s gang had kidnapped her and taken her to Delhi. But the police did not take him seriously and asked him to go and get his daughter from the capital. 

 Shahabuddin went with some neighbours and traced her to a house in Chandni Chowk on February 12. They could not catch Salem, a wanted criminal, though he was there. 

 A police official said Naju told them Salem had taken Shahabuddin?s daughter to Delhi to sell her to a brothel. 

 ?Salem engaged two women to distract the girl when she came out of school. The others kidnapped her and forced her into a waiting car,? the official said.

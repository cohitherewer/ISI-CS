 Curfew hour for tech students

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Sept. 1: Students of the National Institute of Technology (NIT) have been forbidden from leaving the hostel after 7 pm.

 On Tuesday midnight, around 200 students, out without permission, went on the rampage at a motel-cum-bar when it refused to serve drinks.

 We have taken strong exception to the students unruly behaviour. That is why students going out of the hostel after 7 pm without permission will be suspended. No one will be allowed to consume alcohol either on the campus or outside, NIT director A.C. Ganguly said today.

 The students said the decision was an encroachment on free movement. What should I do if somebody wants to meet me after 7 pm? asked a second-year student who did not want to be named. This is a sort of curfew imposed on us.

 Though classes were held as usual, an uneasy calm prevailed on the campus. Policemen have been deployed outside the institute.

 Ganguly said those involved in the incident would be suspended for two semesters. I am awaiting a report from the three-member inquiry committee and action will be initiated on the basis of its findings, he said.

 The committee, headed by NITs disciplinary wing chief Partha Sengupta, has been asked to submit its report by tomorrow. A member of the senate, the institutes highest policy-making body, and the dean are also on the committee. 

 NIT officials said such indecent behaviour is mostly seen among final-year students after they secure jobs through campus recruitment.

 The students who get appointment letters show a dont-care attitude. In order to discourage it, we are planning not to hand over the appointment letters unless they complete studies at the institute and also maintain a good conduct all along, said a member of the NIT Senate.

 Burdwan police superintendent Peeyush Pandey held a meeting with NIT officials today. Six students were rounded up from the spot. Now we need the NITs cooperation to arrest the others.

 Durgapur mayor Rathin Roy has also sought a report from the NIT on the incident.

 Pandey said officers in-charge of all police stations in the district have been asked to keep a vigil on roadside motels, bars and restaurants.

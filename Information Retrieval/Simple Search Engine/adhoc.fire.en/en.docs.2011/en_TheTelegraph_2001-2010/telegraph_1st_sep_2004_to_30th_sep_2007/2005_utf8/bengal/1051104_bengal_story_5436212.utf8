 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Nov. 3: A tigress in her advanced stage of pregnancy today took shelter in a jungle near a village at Patharpratima in South 24 -Parganas. 

 Forest workers have thrown a ring around the jungle to prevent it from entering Sonapur village, 90 km from Calcutta. The districts divisional forest officer said the tigress was spotted a few days ago at a forest along the Jagaddal river in the Sunderbans, several kilometres from its original habitat. The tigress is in search of a warm and safe place for its litter. We cant use tranquillisers in its present state, he added. 

 Cooch Behar: The Greater Cooch Behar Peoples Association held a public meeting here on Thursday to chart its course of action in the demand for a separate state. Its leader Bangshibadan Barman urged supporters to be peaceful, but undeterred. A fast- ing agitation in Septem- ber had turned violent, leading to five deaths.

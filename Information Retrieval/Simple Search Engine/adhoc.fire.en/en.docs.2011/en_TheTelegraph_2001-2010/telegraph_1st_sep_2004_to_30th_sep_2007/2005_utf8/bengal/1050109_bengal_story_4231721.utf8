 Abducted youth untraced

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 8: A hunt to trace A.K. Nawab, a 30-year-old businessman from Metiabruz who was reportedly abducted on Friday, drew a blank 24 hours after the incident. 

 All the efforts initiated by South 24-Parganas police have proved futile.

 According to the police, the owner of two tailoring shops and a school was abducted from the Panchpara area under Metiabruz police station on Friday afternoon. 

 ?He was intercepted by the culprits on his way home. The miscreants, apparently, forced him to go with them at gunpoint,? said an official of the police station.

 After receiving a complaint from Nawab?s family, the police launched a search. 

 ?Anticipating calls for ransom, policemen were also posted at the Nawab?s house on A.K. Roy Lane. But no one has made any call till tonight,? said another official. 

 ?The motive behind the abduction is not clear. We are verifying whether any family or property related dispute has triggered it.?

 The police, however, have activated their source network in the locality. 

 ?We even informed the city police and other police stations in the district. Raid were carried out in several places. We are investigating the case from all possible aspects, but not a single lead has so far emerged,? said a senior official at Alipore police headquarters.

 S.N. Gupta, superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas, said: ?A full-fledged effort has been initiated. Investigators are going through all possible aspects and leads are expected within a day or two.?

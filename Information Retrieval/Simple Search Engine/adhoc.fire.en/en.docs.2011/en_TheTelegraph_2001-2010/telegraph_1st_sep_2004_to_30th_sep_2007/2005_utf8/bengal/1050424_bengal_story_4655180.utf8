 Snail cops in ?identity? crisis

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 23: The long arm of the law has not been able to reach the youths who beat up Supratip Dutta in a crowded private bus because he protested against their lewd behaviour. 

 Police said a probe began immediately after a complaint was lodged on Friday and a search was on to track down the accused. 

 ?We have already come up with a list of suspects, but as the complainant did not mention names, it will take some time to establish their identity,? an officer of the Chitpur police station said.

 Dutta, 32, a Baranagar resident, was thrashed by the gang of eve-teasers near Paikpara in the bus on route 234/1 around 9 pm on Thursday. He registered a complaint with the Chitpur police station the next morning.

 Dutta said three non-Bengali youths aged between 20 and 23 had got on to the bus near Calcutta Medical College and Hospital. 

 They stood in front of a seat reserved for women and were carrying on a conversation that revolved around lewd topics. 

 None of the women seated in front of the youths dared to protest when they made lewd gestures at them. Dutta interrupted their conversation and asked them to behave.

 ?They started hurling abuses and told me to mind my own business,? Dutta said. At this point, some co-passengers began scolding the youths. 

 Sensing that they were outnumbered, they calmed down. Dutta had noticed one of them making a call from his mobile.

 When the bus neared Paikpara, two of the youths went to the gate as if they were about to disembark. When the bus stopped, they did not get off. Dutta said the conductor asked if they wanted to stay on or leave, to which they responded with a fresh volley of abuses. 

 Around this time, more youths emerged from a nearby club and boarded the bus. They surrounded Dutta and started pushing him around.

 Unfazed by the confrontation and expecting his fellow-passengers to come to his aid, Dutta pushed back one of the youths. Blows rained on him immediately. 

 While one of the youths caught him by the collar, the rest of them punched him in the face, chest and abdomen. Dutta fell, his shirt ripped off, but they kept kicking him. 

 Struggling to get back on his feet, Dutta crawled to the rear end of the bus, begging his co-passengers to help. No one stirred.

 Once the youths disappeared, he got out of the bus but could not make it to the police station. Some other passengers took him to a doctor.

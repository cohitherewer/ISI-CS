 First run of a forgotten express

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Alipurduar, March 20: This is one flag-off that will be remembered for all the wrong reasons.

 Only tribals and schoolchildren, waiting on the platform with bated breath and offerings of coconuts and flowers, and local RSP MP Joachim Buxla saw the Alipurduar-Ranchi Express off as it trundled out on its maiden journey to Ranchi today.

 There were no railway officials present, no celebrations, in fact, no plans for any festive send-off.

 A.K. Biswas, the divisional commercial manager of Alipurduar, said the Northeast Frontier Railway (NFR) had no plans to hold a ceremony. ?We did not invite anyone as we had no scheduled plan,? he said.

 The NFR had carried an announcement in local newspapers stating that the train, the first to Jharkhand, will begin plying from today.

 The train will leave here every Thursday and Sunday and from Ranchi on Saturdays and Tuesdays.

 Standing on the platform, Buxla said: ?People of the Dooars have been crying for this train since 1996 as this region has a sizeable tribal population with its roots in the villages of the Chhotanagpur plateau. This is a momentous occasion for them.?

 The Lok Sabha member pointed out that he had stayed away from Parliament to be present here today. He said he was surprised to see that not a single railway representative from the NFR, Maligaon, was present at the station.

 ?I am a member of the Railway Consultative Committee. I will inform the railway minister about this mistake by the officials,? Buxla said.

 What saved the day was the MP?s presence of mind. Considering the enthusiasm of the thousands of people, mostly from the tea gardens in the vicinity, Buxla himself organised an impromptu flag-off. He also cracked coconuts on the platform and the crowd cheered and waved the engine driver and a large number of passengers on their way.

 Buxla said the people of the Dooars would also be benefited by the Mahananda Express, which connects New Jalpaiguri to Delhi, being extended to Alipurduar from April 1.

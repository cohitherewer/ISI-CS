 From kettle to scalpel

 RANJAN LAHIRY

 Burdwan, June 7: At the crack of dawn, Manjur Hossain walks about 200 yards from his mud-walled thatched-roof hut to open his fathers tea-stall and reach into a wooden box for coal. 

 He continues ? breaking chunks of coal into nuggets with a sooty hammer and placing them inside the chullah. Then he stuffs newspaper in the pit and strikes a match. Within minutes, smoke billows out. By this time, it is past 5 and his father Iqbal Hossain arrives to start the shop on the outskirts of Burdwan town, about 115 km from Calcutta. In the next 15 minutes, customers, mostly agricultural labourers and masons, begin to drop in.

 This is how the day begins for the 20-year-old who will become Dr Manjur Hossain in five years, if?

 Despite having ranked 200 in this years Joint Entrance Examination ? a ticket to one of the top medical colleges in the state ? Manjur is not sure if he will be able to pursue the MBBS course.

 His father, who earns about Rs 70 a day, sounds helpless. How can I send my son to study MBBS? I cannot afford it, says Iqbal. 

 Sending his second son to study medicine would mean an additional monthly expense of about Rs 2,000 in tuition and hostel fees and food bills. Iqbal has written to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, seeking help. He would have sent the letter by ordinary post if a neighbour had not helped him get it registered.

 Manjur passed Higher Secondary from Burdwan Town School with a score of 723 in 2003 but could not pursue studies beyond that because his father could not provide for it. So, like brother Sabed, who is two years older, Manjur took to the cup and kettle. Their younger brother, Suleman, studies in Class VII in the same school.

 However, after a two-year break, Manjur had a change of heart. I saw some of my friends, poor like me, who also could not study after HS. So, I decided to sit for the JEE, he said. Between hours of serving bhanrs (earthen cups) of tea, Manjur slipped out to return home ? his old HS books were his only help in preparations for the test.

 A day after the JEE results came out, he said: By getting a medical seat I have landed my father in trouble. I am very tense. But, I can tell you? If I become a doctor, I will come to help poor students like me in the future.

 When word got around that Manjur has made it to the merit list, Chhoto Nilpur exploded with joy. Residents raised funds for sweets. 

 We will try our best to ensure Manjurs education. The example he has set will encourage others, said Shyamal Biswas, a resident.

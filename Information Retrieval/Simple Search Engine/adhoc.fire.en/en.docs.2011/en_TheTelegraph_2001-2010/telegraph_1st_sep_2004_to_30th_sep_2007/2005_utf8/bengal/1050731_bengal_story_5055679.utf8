 Storm in garden

 STAFF REPORTER

 Troubled waters

 Calcutta, July 30: The clouds are hanging heavy over the Botanical Gardens in Howrah with the authorities transferring seven employees in a clampdown on an agitation.

 They have been shifted to different Botanical Survey of India (BSI) offices across the country for pressing ahead with an indefinite strike at the garden.

 On May 1, the authorities had drawn up a new work schedule for employees and asked them to report for work at 6 every morning instead of the earlier 9.30 am. 

 But the staff refused to accept the revised roster and launched a protest ? which has been continuing over the last couple of months ? and also called an indefinite strike.

 G.S. Giri, the joint director of the Botanical garden who issued the transfer orders, has reportedly been receiving threat calls. 

 A permanent police picket has been posted at his office and he has been given an armed bodyguard. 

 Giri has also chargesheeted 46 employees of the garden. BSI officials in Calcutta said all the 46 had taken part in organising the agitation.

 Giri refused to comment about the row. I am not in a position to tell you details about what is happening in the garden. But I am working hard to protect the garden at any cost. I am also grateful to the district and police authorities who are helping me a lot in carrying out my job, he said.

 Of the seven employees shunted out, six are believed to have moved the Central Administrative Tribunal against the transfer orders. The tribunal will hear them on August 9.

 The Union ministry of environment and forest has spoken out against the employees agitation. The secretary of the ministry, Pradipto Ghosh, held a marathon meeting in the city on July 13 and 14 to take stock of the situation. 

 Ghosh apparently told Giri and other BSI officials in Calcutta not to succumb to pressure from the protesters and stick to the new work schedule.

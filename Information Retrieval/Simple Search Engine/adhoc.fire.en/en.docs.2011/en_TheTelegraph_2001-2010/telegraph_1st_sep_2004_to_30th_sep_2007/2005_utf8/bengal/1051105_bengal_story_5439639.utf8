 Busy babus close doors on people, boss fumes

 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN

 Behrampore, Nov. 4: In Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees do-it-now Bengal, babus are still babus until a superior raps them on the knuckles.

 During a surprise visit to Jalangi, about 250 km from Writers Buildings, the Murshidabad district magistrate saw a brass plate on the door of the block development officers chamber. It said he would meet visitors only between 1 pm and 2 pm. 

 N. Manjunatha Prasad could not quite understand how a BDO could reserve only an hour ? that too according to his convenience ? to meet people.

 He rushed to the subdivisional officers room. There was a plate on the SDOs office door, too. He was available for an hour more ? between 11 am and 1 pm.

 Prasad was angry. I meet people through the day. I had thought all my officers do the same. But the visit changed my perception.

 On his return to Behrampore from the surprise visit, days before the Puja, he ordered that all such plates be taken off. 

 After the Puja, he issued a circular to 26 BDOs, five SDOs and four assistant district magistrates saying a government officer must meet people at all hours between 10 am and 5 pm, if not through the day. 

 Government officers are not zamindar babus that they will meet people according to their sweet will. Public servants should be available at all working hours and ideally all 24 hours. I have also issued a circular to all my officers asking them to attend to the needs of the common people at all hours during office time. There should be no attempt to evade the public, the district magistrate said. 

 If my instructions are not followed, I will take strong action against the officers, he added. 

 People from far-flung areas come to the officers seeking assistance. 

 Abdul Munim, a trader, who came to Behrampore from Shamshergunj, 80 km away, to meet additional district magistrate Golam Ali Ansari and get the licence for his fathers double-barrel gun transferred to his name, missed the deadline by minutes. Ansari met people only till 1 pm.

 I was caught in a traffic jam. I had to return home and come back on another occasion to get my work done, said Munim.

 Ansari has now removed the plate specifying visiting hours. I am available any time from 10 to 5, he said.

 Prasad said he would continue his surprise visits to keep a check on the administrations functioning. He said: I have also asked my officers to visit at least one village, particularly those in the backward areas, once a week to understand the problems of the people better.

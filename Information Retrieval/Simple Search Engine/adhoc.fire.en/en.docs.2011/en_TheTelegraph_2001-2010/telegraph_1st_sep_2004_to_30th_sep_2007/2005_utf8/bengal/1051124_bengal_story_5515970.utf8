 Warrant whack for head-less school

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 23: Calcutta High Court yesterday issued a warrant of arrest against the secretary and the teacher in charge of a school in Burdwan for flouting its directive to appoint a headmaster. 

 Deno Satchidananda Vidyayatan has been running without a head for the last 18 years.

 Police will have to produce Beni Gopal Koley, the secretary of the schools managing committee, and teacher-in-charge Biswanath Ghosh on December 6, when the matter will come up for hearing. 

 The court also ordered the state director of school education and district inspector of schools (secondary) of Burdwan to be present in court on that day. 

 The registrar of this court is directed to ensure that the order... is followed properly. The police, however, will have the liberty to release the secretary and teacher-in-charge against a bail bond of Rs 500 each, but they will have to ensure their presence during the next hearing, it said.

 The district inspector told the court yesterday that the file relating to the case was missing. That is why the court order could not be carried out. 

 The remark had Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar fuming. You will find the file inside jail, he retorted. 

 Durgapada Das, who was the headmaster since 1987, moved the high court because he was not recommended for the post once the school got government recognition in 1987. Since then, a teacher-in-charge has been doing the job.

 The high court had directed the state education department to appoint a headmaster immediately. But the order was not carried out. A contempt petition, filed in 1991, is still pending before the court.

 The case sputtered back to life last Thursday when the high court asked the government to explain why it had ignored the order.

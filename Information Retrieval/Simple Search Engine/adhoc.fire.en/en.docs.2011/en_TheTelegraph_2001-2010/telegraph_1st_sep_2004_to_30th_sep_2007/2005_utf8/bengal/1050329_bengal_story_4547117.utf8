 Life term for CPM leaders 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Purulia, March 28: A CPM district secretariat member and a zonal secretary were among 10 partymen sentenced to life today for murdering four Jharkhand Mukti Morcha workers over two decades ago.

 Ananda Mahato, Phuleswar Mahato, Rohini Mahato and Lakshman Mahato were killed when CPM cadre armed with tangis (local machetes) attacked JMM supporters on June 3, 1984. The assault near Bhangra More, in the mufassil police station area here, about 265 km from Calcutta, also left six others seriously injured. 

 Police had picked up 33 people but chargesheeted 21. 

 Bipin Bihari Mukherjee, the additional Purulia sessions judge, found 11 of them not guilty. Announcing the verdict, he cast doubts over the role of the police doctor. ?In this case, the role of the police doctor was not transparent. He tried to protect the accused. This is the reason people are losing faith in the police.? The convicts were fined Rs 15,000 each.

 CPM district secretary Nakul Mahato said the party would move the high court against the order nailing its secretariat member, Shaktipada Goswami, zonal secretary Anadi Mahato, local committee member Chinibas Mahato and seven ?active workers?.

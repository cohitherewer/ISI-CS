 State to shield its say in small banks 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Feb. 3: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government today said it would oppose tooth and nail any move by the Centre to bring cooperative banks in Bengal under the direct control of the Reserve Bank of India.

 Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen said the Union finance ministry has already set up a committee to finalise the procedure. The cooperative banks are now under the National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (Nabard) with the state governments having a say in their investment and loan disbursement policies.

 Describing Delhi?s move as ?anti-people?, Sen said both the state government and the ruling CPM have conveyed their feelings separately to the Union finance ministry.

 ?The United Progressive Alliance government at the Centre has decided to bring the cooperative banks in the country directly under the RBI umbrella. We have already informed the Union finance minister that we are opposed to the move. We will vehemently resist the attempt at any cost because if the RBI controls the cooperative banks, they would become like any other commercial bank? They will lose their character of serving as a source of money for the poor. Small farmers in our state then will not be able to secure loans for agriculture and other small-scale ventures,? Sen said after inaugurating a three-storey building for a cooperative bank in Krishnagar, 80 km from Calcutta.

 He added: ?The commercial banks in our country do not give loans to poor people since the early 1990s, when the market-oriented banking policy was adopted. The new move by the Centre will spell disaster for farmers.?

 Further justifying the state?s opposition, Sen said under the RBI?s umbrella, more and more restrictions will be imposed on the credit and investment norms of the cooperative banks in line with the commercial banks. ?The state governments, which control these banks largely, will lose their voice,? he said.

 But in tune with the government?s drive to improve work culture and environment, Sen said in the same breath that the cooperative bank employees should work harder and make the institutions real instruments to serve the poor.

 ?Often banks disburse loans to the wealthy people instead of poor farmers, who need the money more. We often see that the poor farmers repay loans regularly while a section of wealthy businessmen in our state do not,? said Sen.

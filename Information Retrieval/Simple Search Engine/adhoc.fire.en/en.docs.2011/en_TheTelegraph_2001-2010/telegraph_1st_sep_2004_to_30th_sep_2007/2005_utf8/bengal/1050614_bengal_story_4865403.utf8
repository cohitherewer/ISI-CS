 Plea on voter identification

 Calcutta, June 13: A Trinamul Congress delegation today urged state election commissioner Ajoy Sinha not to recognise a tenants bill or an employers certificate as identification for a valid voter. 

 The party also requested Sinha to ensure that police checked queues in front of polling booths regularly so that outsiders could not sneak in. 

 Saugata Roy, the Trinamul MLA from Dhakuria, said a ban on the tenants bill and employers certificate as voter identity cards will discourage the CPM from bringing in false voters. 

 Sinha said the panel will look into the demands.

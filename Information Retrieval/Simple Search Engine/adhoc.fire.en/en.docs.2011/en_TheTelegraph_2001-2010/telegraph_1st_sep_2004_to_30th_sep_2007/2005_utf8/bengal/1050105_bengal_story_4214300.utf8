 Retirement notice at 

Great Eastern

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Jan.4: The state government today made a decisive move towards privatising Great Eastern Hotel by asking three trade unions to inform all 425 employees to get ready to accept an early retirement scheme.

 Nine domestic and international hotel groups have shown interest in acquiring the hotel. Among the bidders are ITC Ltd, the Park Hotels, Intercontinental South West Asia and Bharat Hotels. The Claridges Hotel group, Ramluk AB (a Scandinavian company), Unitech Group, Kenilworth and Sinclairs Hotels are also in the race. 

 Three companies not in the hospitality sector have also bid for the property. These are Ruia Kotex, MP Glychem and Finolice Group.

 The government?s effort to sell the hotel to a private company without encumbrances forms the background to today?s development.

 ?We had a preliminary discussion with the unions today, and offered the package for each of the 425 staff members. We plan to wind up the labour issue by March this year,? a senior government official said after the meeting. 

 Senior officials, including the principal secretary of the industrial reconstruction department, Sunil Mitra, and his counterpart in the tourism department, A.K. Patnaik, met members of the Intuc, Citu and Jay Mazdoor Forum. 

 While the Citu supported the move even while advocating continuation of government control, the Intuc protested. Ramen Pandey and Atiar Rahman of the Intuc said the state could not force employees to opt for the scheme without offering them an alternative. 

 ?Initially, the government had announced that they were going in for a joint venture, but now they are planning to sell the hotel,? Rahman said. 

 Citu members said the union was not averse to restructuring as long as control lay with the state. But the union?s state secretary, Kali Ghosh, conceded that the state would have to hand over the hotel ?if it cannot afford to run it any more, but workers must get their legitimate dues?. 

 Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen was more categorical. The minister, also in charge of industrial reconstruction, said: ?The state government has decided not to run Great Eastern Hotel any more. We will hand over the management of the hotel to a private company. We can offer up to 74 per cent stake to the company.?

 He did not rule out the possibility of selling a higher stake, if the government?s consultant in the deal so advised.

 Sen said: ?The decision will also take into account what the bidder wants. One of the most important conditions on our part is that Great Eastern Hotel must be run as a heritage hotel, which means the structure cannot be altered??

 The tenders were called in November and the government is evaluating the bids.

 Calcutta, July 9: Gunmen raided a home in Topsia, dragged a man outside and shot him dead in the early hours today.

 Mohammed Ahmed (38), resident of 7D Abinash Chowdhury Lane at Darapara, took four bullets in his head and body in the 1.30 am attack, police said.

 No arrests have been made. We have launched an investigation, said Gyanwant Singh, deputy commissioner (I) of the detective department, headquarters.

 The police said Ahmed, a worker with a tobacco company, had recently started a small real-estate business with a few partners. He had run up a debt of Rs 10,000.

 Ahmed had returned home around 10 pm yesterday, his wife Zeenat Begum said. About half an hour later, he received a call on his mobile phone and spoke to the caller for some time. After that, he had dinner and went to bed. Around 11 pm, he received another call.

 He went out of the house without telling his wife where he was going. He told me that everything was all right and he would return soon, Zeenat said.

 Ahmed came back after some 20 minutes and went to bed again.

 Around 1.30, the family was woken up by knocks on the door and loud calls for Ahmed by name.

 As soon as Ahmed opened the door, two men grabbed him by the collar and dragged him out in front of a stunned Zeenat and their children.

 A quarrel broke out. Suddenly, one of the visitors pulled out a revolver and shot Ahmed in the head. He collapsed to the ground. 

 After that, they shot him three more times in the back, belly and chest to make sure he was dead, Zeenat said. She added she didnt know any of the killers.

 I heard three or four loud bangs and tried to come out of my room but found the door locked from outside, a next-door neighbour said.

 Later, Topsia police removed the corpse and sent it to NRS Medical College and Hospital.

 We are trying to find out the motive behind the murder. The case is a difficult one in the sense that Ahmed had no previous record of crime, a police officer said.

 Neither his neighbours nor his family know who his associates were. His wife hasnt given us anything concrete to go upon.

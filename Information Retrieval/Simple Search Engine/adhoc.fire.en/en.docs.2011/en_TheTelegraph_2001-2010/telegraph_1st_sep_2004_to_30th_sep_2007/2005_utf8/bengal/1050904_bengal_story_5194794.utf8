 Governor does a dengue recce

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 3: A day after the high court rapped the government for dragging its feet on dengue, it was governor Gopal Krishna Gandhis turn to take stock of the situation.

 On a day when the dengue toll went up to 13 ? Rajiv Dutta, 22, died at Karimpur in Nadia ? the governor went to the School of Tropical Medicine and Medical College to see how things work.

 Around 12.05 pm, Gopal Gandhi took Tropical by surprise when he headed straight to the virology department to check how blood samples were being tested for dengue. With director of medical education Jayshree Mitra in tow, he enquired about the problems of patients who had turned up for blood tests. 

 He saw the kits, asked the doctors for dengue figures and left for Medical College. 

 There, the governor saw mothers having to share bed with their new-borns. He asked some of them about their age and seemed disturbed to hear that at 20 or 21, many of them had delivered their second child, Mitra said.

 The governors visit coincided with the health departments decision to buy kits to test blood samples for all the medical colleges. Rattled by the court rap, the health headquarters has decided that the kits would be purchased from the market and despatched to the microbiology departments of the medical colleges by early next week. Each kit, costing around Rs 12,000, would have dengue antigen and show in case the anti-body is present in blood. 

 Health service director Prabhakar Chatterjee said: Blood samples are now being sent to Tropical for tests. Once the kits are ready, the medical colleges can work on their own.

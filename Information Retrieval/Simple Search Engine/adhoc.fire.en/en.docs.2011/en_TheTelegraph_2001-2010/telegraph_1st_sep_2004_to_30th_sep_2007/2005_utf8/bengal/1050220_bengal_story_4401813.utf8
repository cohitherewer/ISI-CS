 Metro in dock for harassment

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 19: A woman employee of Metro Rail has moved Calcutta High Court to uphold her claim of harassment at the hands of her male seniors, but has been unable to move the rail authorities for the justice she seeks.

 Sunanda Das, 32, a senior Metro clerk, the only lady posted in the Tollygunge car shed, lodged a complaint with Regent Park police station on July 2004, alleging that she was subjected to regular harassment by two of her bosses ? an assistant electrical engineer and a chief loco inspector. 

 ?I am the only lady employee in the office and two senior officers very often use abusive language towards me,? Sunanda said in her complaint.

 Her husband Abhijit Das, a bank employee, then wrote to the Metro general manager narrating the whole story and requesting him to transfer her to any other office. The authorities declined to accept the plea.

 Sunanda moved the Central Administrative Tribunal in August 2004. Her lawyer Bidisha Banerjee told the tribunal she was feeling ?uncomfortable? and ?suffocated? working with her seniors. ?Their behaviour is intolerable to my client. The court should ask the authority to transfer her to any other office of the Metro Railway,? Banerjee submitted.

 For the railway, advocate L.C. Chatterjee opposed the allegations. A senior Metro Rail official said: ?We cannot comment before discussing it with the departments concerned.? 

 On August 25, 2004, the tribunal passed an order asking the railway authorities to transfer Sunanda to any other Metro office. 

 Following the order, the authorities shifted her to the Noapara car shed at Dum Dum which, according to her lawyer, is a ?more uncomfortable? place for a woman. ?There is no female employee at the Noapara shed. Moreover, my client has to walk a kilometre to reach a toilet. Worse, the same assistant electrical engineer is in overall charge of the shed,? said Banerjee. 

 Sunanda then moved the high court. The division bench of Justices A.K. Chakraborty and S.P. Talukdar upheld the tribunal?s judgment. The Metro authorities, the judges said, ?sent her from the frying pan to fire?.

 Enter, friends in police uniform

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Police help now a phone 

 call away 

Calcutta, May 24: Dial 100 to call police ? not just law enforcers, but friends in need.

 That is the message the much-maligned force wants to send out in its public relations drive. Director-general Ajay Prasad said at Writers Buildings today: We have started an awareness campaign to make people aware of the new facility that they can use from every nook and cranny of the state. Any call will reach the subdivisional control-room that remains active 24 hours.

 He added that the police would take all kinds of calls and not refuse one on the pretext that it does not fall within our jurisdiction. 

 They will help out people even in case of a fire or a medical emergency and where counselling is required. If required, the police would be sent to the spot or other necessary arrangements would be made, Prasad said.

 We are popularising the concept of community policing, whereby the police would be friends to the people, and work with the help of the common man, he added.

 To popularise the toll-free 100-dial, television and radio commercials, hoardings, posters and print advertisements have been created. 

 The 100-dial facility was launched across the state last September and has already had an encouraging response. The idea is to reach the trouble spot very quickly and help out people as soon as possible, additional director-general of police (law and order), Chayan Mukherjee said.

 At least 10,000 calls now come through the 100-dial network every month. Some people just call to check whether the system works, said an officer.

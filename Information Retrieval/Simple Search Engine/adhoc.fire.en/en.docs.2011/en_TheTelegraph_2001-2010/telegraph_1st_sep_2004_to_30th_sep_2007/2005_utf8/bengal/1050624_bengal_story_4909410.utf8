 Fishing ports first step

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Petuaghat, June 23: The government today kicked off the construction of a Rs 32-crore state-of-the-art fishing harbour ? said to be one of the largest in the country ? with governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi laying the foundation stone.

 Jointly funded by the Centre and the state government, the harbour will take about three years to complete. It is located near Contai in East Midnapore district, 175 km from Calcutta, at the mouth of Rasulpur river as it flows into the Bay of Bengal.

 We will name the fishing harbour after freedom fighter Deshpran Birendra Sashmal and try to complete it within two years. The first jetty will be completed by this December and will be inaugurated by the chief minister, said fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda. 

 He added that the Centre would contribute Rs 16 crore.

 Assistant director of fisheries Utpal Sar said the Petuaghat harbour would have the capacity to house 500 big trawlers and 300 smaller mechanised fishing boats. The harbour will be able to handle and send out about 3,500 tonnes of fish daily, he added.

 The port will have four large jetties. An auction market, a fuel pump and an ice plant would also be constructed. A connecting road from the harbour will be built at a cost of Rs 1.64 crore. Fish marketing centres will be set up at Shankarpur in East Midnapore and Kakdwip and Sultanpur in South 24-Parganas. When the fishing harbour is complete, it will provide employment to about 25,000 people, the minister said.

 The Petuaghat harbour, with its beautiful scenery, will also attract tourists, Nanda said. We will set up a tourist village with cottages to match the backdrop.

 There are plans to develop the nearby Dadanpatrabar and Dariapur as tourist centres as well, fisheries department officials said. Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay had written Kapalkundala in Dariapur.

 While laying the foundation stone, Gandhi said that along with the construction of the harbour, the authorities should make arrangements to combat natural calamities like tsunami. He also said he was proud to step on the land where Bankim Chandras Kapalkundala took shape.

 Truant master locked up

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 28: Parents of students and members of the village education committee in Nadia today locked up a headmaster for not coming to school regularly.

 Villagers of Boreya in the Tehatta area of Nadia, 150 km from Calcutta, alleged that for the last one year, the headmaster of Boreya Primary School, Chandigopal Biswas, came to school only five days a month.

 Whatever little time the headmaster spent in school, he would sleep in the teachers room. Members of the village education committee have also accused the headmaster of not serving midday meals regularly, said the father of a Class III student.

 The parents said they had repeatedly complained to the local sub-inspector of schools but no action was taken.

 Today, about 300 villagers, whose children are among the 250 students of the school, marched to the school around 3 pm and found the headmaster sleeping.

 After asking the teachers and students to leave, the villagers and education committee members locked up the headmaster, whose siesta was disturbed by the commotion. The villagers then gave him a piece of their mind.

 Forces from the Tehatta police station reached the school around 4 pm.

 The villagers agreed to set the headmaster free after officers assured that steps would be taken against him.

 The headmaster is a burden for us. Our children dont get quality education because of his frequent absence. He stays at home most of the time. 

 He is more interested in growing vegetables on his farmland and selling the produce. He has become a businessman, said Sankar Mondal, the president of the village education committee and panchayat member.

 We are helpless. Our students dont get proper education and are often deprived of midday meals. When we complained to the teachers, they expressed helplessness as the headmaster is often absent, said Asraf Mondal, whose son Jahangir studies in Class III of the school.

 Bibhash Biswas, the chairman of the district primary school council, said he had ordered an inquiry against the headmaster.

 I wonder why the local school inspector did not inform me all this while even though he had received complaints. I will send an official to look into the matter. Strong action will be taken against the headmaster if he is found guilty, said Biswas.

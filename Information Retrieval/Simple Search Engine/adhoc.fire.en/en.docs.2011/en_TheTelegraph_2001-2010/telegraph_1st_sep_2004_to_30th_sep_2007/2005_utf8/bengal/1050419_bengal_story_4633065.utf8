 North pitches for agro business

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, April 18: After Team Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the task of hardselling north Bengal as an investment destination was left to four district magistrates. 

 At North Bengal Calling, the investors? meet organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, the Darjeeling, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri and North Dinajpur district magistrates made presentations showcasing the potential the region had for agro-based and auxiliary industries, besides, of course, tea and tourism. 

 Commerce and industries department principal secretary Sabyasachi Sen, who chaired the meet, said apart from appointing a nodal officer immediately, the government has decided to open a full-fledged office of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation(WBIDC) in Siliguri.

 ?Both the CII and the Siliguri Jalpaiguri Development Agency have offered space for the WBIDC office,? he added. 

 ?The government has also identified a 500-acre plot at Dabgram for a special economic zone for tea. If that is not sufficient, there is another piece of land at Dhupguri, Jalpaiguri,? he said while identifying infotech as another untapped sector in the region. 

 On the power subsidy promised by the government for industries that set up shop in the region, Sen said: ?It is not possible for the West Bengal State Electricity Board to offer such subsidies, but there is a scheme whereby the WBIDC could reimburse the bills.? 

 ?We will honour our commitment,? he promised.

 Earlier, while making his presentation, Darjeeling district magistrate Aariz Aftab made a case for trade-driven growth for the district, especially Siliguri, which provided easy access to markets in the Northeast and neighbouring Nepal, Bangladesh and Bhutan.

 ?The opening of the Nathu-la route would increase the potential.? Aftab said the district would be ideal for agro-based industries, especially floriculture and horticulture.

 Also describing Cooch Behar as ideal for agro industries, district magistrate Ravi Inder Singh, mentioned its abundance of potatoes, tomatoes, chillies and jute. 

 Jalpaiguri?s A. Subbiah offered 100 ready-for-sale industrial plots while the North Dinajpur district magistrate detailed crop pattern to encourage investors in food processing.

 Citu factions clash over contract labourers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kharagpur, Feb. 5: Rival Citu workers clashed over recruitment of contract labourers, days after cottage and small-scale industry minister Bansagopal Chowdhury threatened stern action against trade unions interfering with the setting up of industrial units.

 Six persons, including a local committee member of the CPM and the husband of the panchayat samiti president, were taken into custody today after an FIR was lodged at the Kharagpur police station against nine persons involved in Thursday?s clash.

 A group of Citu workers had on Thursday set a temporary CPM office on fire and beaten up activists of the rival faction. The other group retaliated by burning Citu flags and attacking the organisation?s workers.

 The CPM?s factional violence has put contractors engaged in the construction of industrial units in a spot. The contractors have been urged by Mihir Pahari, a Citu leader and secretary of the Bombay Road co-ordination committee, to recruit local unemployed youths and agricultural workers ?in consultation with? gram pradhans.

 However, Tarun Maiti, a contractor, said he had engaged some Citu workers after discussions with the trade union?s Kharagpur regional committee. ?We will have to retrench these workers if we are to make fresh recruitments as desired by Pahari. This will not only antagonise the regional committee but also harm our business as we will incur considerable loss with excess workers,? he said.

 Pahari denied pressuring the contractors to recruit local youth. ?I have only written to them to engage the needy people in consultation with the local gram pradhan,? he said.

 The contractors fear their work may come to a standstill if they do not comply. ?He may not say anything openly. But hundreds of Citu workers will come to the site and stop construction work if the Citu leader?s diktat is not followed,? said a contractor.

 Pahari said they were busy constructing a party office on Thursday when ?some miscreants led by Tapan Chakraborty and Subir Khilari attacked our workers. They beat them up and set the office under construction on fire. They also damaged the motorcycle of local CPM leader Prabir Roy?.

 The Citu leader lodged an FIR with the Kharagpur police station against nine persons, including two CPM members. Pahari also alleged that regional committee member Anit Baran Mandal had masterminded the attack on the party workers.

 The zonal panel member refuted the charges. ?Some persons came here to stop the construction of a local factory, but were resisted by the factory?s workers. Later, these outsiders ransacked some shops and fled,? he said.

 The secretary of the CPM?s Kharagpur zonal committee, Mihir Das, said the row was the ?result of some misunderstanding? and the party is ?conducting an inquiry? to find out who were actually involved.

 A Midnapore district police official conceded that they were finding it difficult to deal with rows between rival CPM activists. However, superintendent of police Ajoy Nanda said they would intervene if clashes take place. ?Our priority is to provide security to the people irrespective of their profession and political colour,? he said.

 Teesta set to change course 

 ANURADHA SHARMA LAKHOTIA

 Rambhi, May 23: After a turbulent and meandering journey through rocks and boulders from its source in Chumthang (north Sikkim), the feisty Teesta is in for a smooth ride in this stretch for the next two-and-a-half years.

 A 600-metre stretch of the river will be diverted about 50 feet left of its course and forced to flow through an artificial channel for the period, during which a barrage will be constructed across its dry riverbed.

 All eyes are now set on May 30 when, as part of the National Hydroelectric Power Corporations Teesta Low Dam Project Stage III, the course of the river will be altered.

 The authorities, however, are afraid that the monsoon might play spoilsport. We will have to divert the course by May 30, said chief engineer Sahadev Khatua, working on the project some 45 km from Siliguri. 

 If the monsoon sets in earlier than usual, construction of the barrage will be delayed by six to eight months.

 At present, the Teesta flows around 50 m right of its original course. It had been temporarily diverted in December. 

 Diverting the river through the concrete channel is a much bigger challenge. We will be able to begin work on the barrage from September only if we are successful in diverting the Teesta, Khatua said.

 A race against time is how over 1,500 workers and engineers of the corporation describe their last-moment preparations as they wait for the big day with an eye on the gathering clouds in the horizon.

 We have deployed 200 extra labourers in the past two months and have also brought sophisticated machines to meet the deadline, the chief engineer said.

 Stage III of the project, estimated at over Rs 800 crore, is the first major hydel-power project on the Teesta after it enters Bengal and is expected to generate 132 mw.

 Work on the fast-track project started last October after the forest department gave it the go-ahead in May. 

 The project is expected to be over by March 2008. About 180 hectares of forestland had to be cut down for it but no eviction had to be done.

 The barrage will also have a fish ladder, which the power major will introduce at an extra Rs 6 crore. Migratory fish often use this stretch to move upstream, Khatua said. The device would facilitate their movement.

 Two sites in Bengal and six in Sikkim had been identified on the Teesta, of which work on the Medium Dam Project at Singtam (also by the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation) is over. 

 Clearance is awaited for Stage IV of the project at Kalijhora, also undertaken by the corporation.

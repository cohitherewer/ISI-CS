 Missing patients set off alarm

 - Admission only with proof of identity

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, April 18: Alarmed by the number of patients fleeing the hospital everyday, the medical college and hospital here today decided to admit people only after verifying their identity and residential address.

 Hospital superintendent Sarit Chowdhury said many patients sneak out leaving behind their dues. ?They often give false addresses and cannot be traced. So, we decided to make it mandatory for all patients to submit proof of name and address during admission,? he added.

 Over the past few months, on an average, a couple of dozen patients have left the hospital without informing the authorities, said an official.

 ?In future, we will go through documents like voters? I-card, ration card, driving licence, telephone and electricity bills before admitting a patient,? he added.

 According to hospital records, 26 patients disappeared yesterday, 28 patients fled on April 16 and 26 could not be found in their beds on April 15. In all the cases, complaints were lodged with police.

 Citing an instance, the authorities said Kajal Ghosh, 37, was admitted to the surgical ward on March 20. Her stitches were taken off on April 5. The same night, she fled from her bed and could not be traced. Her husband had deposited Rs 170 before the operation and now she owes the hospital Rs 702. 

 Efforts to trace her proved futile as her Panagarh Bazar address was fake. 

 An official said a probe is also on to find out if a section of employees is part of a racket helping such patients.

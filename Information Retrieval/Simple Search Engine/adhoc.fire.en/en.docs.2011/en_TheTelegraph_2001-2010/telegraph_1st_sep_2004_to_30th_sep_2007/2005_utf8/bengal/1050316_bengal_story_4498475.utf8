 Coded textbooks for HS schools

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 15: The West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education today asked schools across the state to adhere to its guidelines on the use of textbooks from the next academic session when a new syllabus will be introduced at the plus-two level. 

 ?We have already published our book lists for the new syllabus and issued circulars to all schools on this score. We will initiate measures against schools that do not follow our guidelines,? said Gopa Dutta, the president of the council.

 Its secretary Debasish Sarkar said that for the first time, all textbooks recommended by the council are being given code numbers so that students and teachers identify the genuine from the fake. ?It will help us maintain a uniform policy regarding use of textbooks,? he added. 

 On the kind of action the council would take against schools flouting its guidelines, Dutta said: ?We will first prepare a list of such schools and decide what can be done. But we believe that all the schools will abide by our guidelines.?

 The council has released a list of textbooks on 27 subjects and sent it to all schools. 

 Sarkar said special measures were taken while printing the textbooks. Publishers had sent books written according to the new syllabus, which were scrutinised by reviewers appointed by the council.

 Some books were sent back to publishers for modifications. The books that met the council?s satisfaction were marked with a code.

 The council?s guidelines came in the wake of a string of complaints that several schools in the districts were not using textbooks recommended by it. ?This was possible so far as all our textbooks did not have code numbers,? said Sarkar.

 Dutta said 1,69,157 girls and 2,34,072 boys would be appearing for this year?s higher secondary exams, beginning on Tuesday. 

 She added that the council has forbidden use of mobile phones, pagers and digital diaries inside the examination hall. ?We have also urged the police to keep Xerox counters located near the centres closed during the examination.?

 A control room has been set up at the council headquarters in Salt Lake, which can be contacted on phone numbers 23374945 and 23374984 if candidates face problems on exam days.

 TV maker coming to town

 RAJEEV RAVIDAS

 Ready for one Made in Siliguri?

 Siliguri, Nov. 6: Videocon will manufacture television sets at a food-processing unit near here that once made jams, jellies and pickles. 

 The company has sub- mitted its proposal entailing an investment of Rs 100 crore to the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation. 

 Yes, we have received such a proposal from Videocon and are studying it, said Gopal Krishna, its managing director. 

 Getting government approval for the project should be a formality as chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee himself had earlier called for the take-over of Kanchan, the closed food-processing unit at Matigara on the outskirts of Siliguri. 

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, who has been hard-selling north Bengal as an investment destination, suggested as much and went on to say: Videocon chairman and managing director V.N. Dhoot will make an announcement on November 30.

 Videocon, Gopal Krishna added, has promised to absorb all workers of Kanchan, which was run by the Darjeeling Fruit and Vegetable Processing Cooperative Society and has 35 workers (17 of them permanent). 

 To make ends meet, the employees now make pickles on their own and market them under the brand name of Kanchan.

 A source said the new Videocon unit would cater to the Northeast and markets in neighbouring countries. Initially, the company plans to manufacture around 1 lakh television sets a year.

 The process of handing over Kanchan has apparently begun. The government would soon appoint a liquidator, who will assess the assets and liabilities of Kanchan before initiating negotiations with Videocon, he added. 

 The liabilities of Kanchan, spread over 2.6 acres of prime industrial land, are not too daunting, especially after the government decided to waive the Rs 42 lakh that it had given it as loan. It now owes around Rs 5 or 6 lakh to a bank. 

 On November 30, the Videocon boss will not, however, be the only star in town. Tennis sensation Sania Mirza and senior pro Mahesh Bhupathi would also be here to take part in an exhibition tournament being sponsored by the television maker.

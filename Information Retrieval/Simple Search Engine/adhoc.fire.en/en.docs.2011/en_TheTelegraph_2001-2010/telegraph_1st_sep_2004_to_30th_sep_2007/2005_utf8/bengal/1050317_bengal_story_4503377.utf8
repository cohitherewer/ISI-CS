 Master forger, a la DiCaprio

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, March 16: In Catch Me If You Can, the FBI chased Leonardo DiCaprio across the US after he forged millions of dollars worth of pay cheques for Pan Am pilots.

 Police here today arrested Ujjal Chatterjee, an unemployed BCom graduate, and Onkar Kishore Chakraborty, a postal savings agent, also for allegedly forging cheques ? with precision that could have matched DiCaprio?s. 

 A Chandigarh-based company, the police said, had issued debentures last year and given high-value, post-dated cheques to the holders. 

 Chatterjee, 40, a resident of Bidhannagar Housing Colony here, who sometimes worked as a small-time agent and handled some of the bonds, drew up a list of 28 holders in Burdwan, Bankura, South 24-Parganas and as far away as Uttar Pradesh and approached them individually.

 Anand Kumar, the Durgapur additional superintendent of police, said: ?Ujjal posed as an investment consultant and approached 28 debenture holders. He convinced them that the company was not in very good shape and urged them not to wait till the end of the lock-in period. He also claimed to know people in the company and that he could arrange payment immediately against commission. He bagged cheques worth about Rs 15 lakh.?

 The police said he used chemicals to erase the dates on the cheques. ?He also opened separate accounts in the names of the debenture holders at the main post office of Durgapur with the help of Kishore and deposited the cheques, amounting to Rs 14,74,500. They were encashed.?

 The forgery came to light late last year when the bank on which the cheques were drawn sent statements. An officer said: ?Ujjal immediately surrendered, apologised to the company and promised to pay back the entire amount. He wrote three account payee cheques for Rs 5 lakh each. Chatterjee also paid Rs 1.42 lakh in cash in three instalments and took receipts for them. But the cheques bounced.?

 When the company again confronted Ujjal, he produced the receipts, which he had again fudged to show he had paid back the sum. The company had no way but to knock the police doors then.

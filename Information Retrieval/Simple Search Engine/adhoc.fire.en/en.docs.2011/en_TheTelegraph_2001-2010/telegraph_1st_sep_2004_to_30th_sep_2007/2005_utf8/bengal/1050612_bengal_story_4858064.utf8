 Mother dies in bid to save son

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 11: Rina Paswan, who was four months pregnant, died trying in vain to save her eight-year-old son from drowning in a Howrah village this morning.

 Rina, 30, and her son Rajesh used to bathe in a pond in front of their house at Fatepur village under Amta police station, 90 km from Calcutta. Neither could swim.

 Today, they went for their bath around 9.30 am. Suddenly, Rajesh strayed into deeper waters and began to sink. Seeing her son gasping for life, Rina jumped in after him.

 As the mother and son were struggling, Rinas six-year-old daughter Soni sat on the ghat watching helplessly. Later, a villager, Sandhya Maiti, found the girl sitting there crying.

 I asked her what happened. She told me her mother and brother had drowned, Sandhya said.

 As Sandhya raised an alarm, some villagers started to look for Rina and Rajesh in the pond. Around 10.30 am, the bodies were found.

 Police said Rinas husband Laldeb Paswan, a driver, had come to Howrah from his home in Bihar a month ago. The family was staying in a rented house at Fatepur.

 Both mother and son were drowned. Police fished out the bodies and sent them for post-mortem. A case of unnatural death has been registered, said Howrah superintendent of police Mihir Bhattacharya.

 Missing student

 Debasish Swami, 20, who had been missing since Wednesday, was found this morning. Debasish, a student of history honours at Uluberia College, reached his sisters place in Asansol this morning. 

 Debasish told family members he had been unconscious and, when he came to, he found himself on a platform of Samastipur railway station. From there he reached his sisters place. 

 The Uluberia boy stays in a students mess at Shyampur. He appeared for an examination on June 8 and went missing the same day.

 His family lodged a complaint with the Shyampur police station. Police had launched an inquiry into the disappearance.

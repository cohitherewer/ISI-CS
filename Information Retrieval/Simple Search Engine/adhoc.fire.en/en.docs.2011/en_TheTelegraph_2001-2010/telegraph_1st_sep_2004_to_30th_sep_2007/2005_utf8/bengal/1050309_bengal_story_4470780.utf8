 Minister mission

 Calcutta, March 8: The government and the CPM are backing his crusade against corrupt officials, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said today. 

 Mollah said the memory of criticism from party colleagues for the ?unimaginable corruption? in his department spurred him to start the cleansing act. ?I was flooded with charges against my own officers? I was almost ripped apart by my own party,? he said. ?I had no option but to go for the clean-up.?

 There is no rift with the party on the issue, said the minister, who called some union leaders thieves. ?Why should there be a clash of approach?? The officers, though, are up in arms against Mollah since he began his mission.

 Teacher triumphs in burqa battle

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, May 4: Susmita Mondal has won the right to wear burqa to school.

 The managing committee of Annandamani Girls? High School in Naoda in Murshidabad, 210 km from Calcutta, today said the teacher need not wear a sari, which her seniors had claimed was a school tradition.

 ?Susmita Mondal can come to school in a burqa as the dress is not offensive. She has not broken any school rule by wearing the burqa. So why should we ask her to wear a sari?? asked the secretary of the managing committee, Alla Rakha Sheikh. 

 On her first day in school on April 25, Susmita, who converted to Islam at the time of her marriage, wore a burqa and was told by senior teachers and the school administration to follow tradition by sticking to the sari.

 Teacher-in-charge Gouri Ghosh, among those who cracked the sari whip, today said: ?On my part, there is no pressure on Susmita to wear a sari. But, if there is any objection from any student or guardian, I will inform the school managing committee and the district inspector of schools. Then I will follow whatever instruction they give.?

 District magistrate N. Manjunatha Prasad pointed out that a Muslim woman cannot be barred from wearing a burqa. 

 ?The matter should be settled across the table by the school authorities. If it is required, I can visit the school and hold a meeting with the school authorities to settle the matter amicably,? he said.

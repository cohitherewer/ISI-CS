 Cry for Delhi rebel shield

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 21: The state government has sought more forces from the Centre to rein in Naxalites.

 Home secretary Amit Kiran Deb today said he has asked for two CRPF battalions to step up vigil in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore. 

 Bengal has long been demanding more central forces to combat the growing violence unleashed by CPI (Maoists) in the three districts.

 On Saturday, Deb was in Delhi to attend a meeting of home secretaries from seven Naxalite-infested states, including Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and Orissa. 

 The government?s resolve comes at a time when it is under pressure to go the Andhra way and bring the rebels to the talks table.

 However, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has refused to conduct any dialogue with the Naxalites if they continue to ?carry arms and randomly kill people?. 

 ?Who should we talk to? They don?t have a fixed address,? Bhattacharjee had said.

 Bhattacharjee has raised the issue a number of times with Union home minister Shivraj Patil. 

 ?Last year, the Centre withdrew one battalion of the CRPF, which they had earlier sanctioned for Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore districts. We have sought its redeployment in addition to another battalion,? Deb said at Writers? Buildings.

 Gangeshwar Prasad Singh, DIG (Midnapore range), said the three districts are the worst sufferers of the Naxalite menace. ?The current strength of central forces is not enough. So we have asked for more men.?

 Four companies of central forces are currently deployed in West Midnapore, three are posted in Purulia and two companies are stationed in Bankura. 

 The BSF was deployed in the districts for the first time in December 2003 after a spate of violence triggered by the rebels.

 Naxalites have killed 15 CPM leaders and their supporters between 2001 and 2003 in addition to 22 police personnel. 

 In February 2004, the rebels set off a blast in Belpahari in West Midnapore soon after central forces were withdrawn, leaving eight policemen dead.

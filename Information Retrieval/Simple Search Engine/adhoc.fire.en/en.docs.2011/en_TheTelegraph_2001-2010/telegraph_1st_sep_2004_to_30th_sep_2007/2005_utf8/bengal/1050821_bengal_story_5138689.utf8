 BRIEFS

 Gangadharpur, Aug. 20: Nirupam Sen , Abdur Rezzak Molla , Jogesh Burman and Kanti Ganguly today escaped unhurt as the launch in which they were travelling dashed into the jetty while anchoring at Gangadharpur in South 24-Parganas.

 The ministers were on their way to Gangadharpur, 120 km from Calcutta, to lay the foundation stone of a bridge. Officials at the spot immediately brought the situation under control.

 Calcutta: Two motorcycle-borne thieves were arrested last night from Nature Park near Budge Budge station. The duo used to target commuters, mainly in Thakurpukur, Taratolla, New Alipore and Behala, and get away because of the manoeuvrability of their bike.

 Shalishi bill back in cupboard

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 17: The government today shelved the controversial block-level pre-litigation conciliatory board bill following Opposition objections.

 Better known as shalishi bill, the legislation would have offered an opportunity to resolve disputes before moving court. 

 Besides Opposition parties, lawyers, too, had opposed the bill and threatened to skip courts in protest. 

 CPM insiders said the bill, earlier scheduled to be placed before the House on March 22, might not see the light of day before next year?s Assembly polls.

 The government decided to go slow on it after the chief minister?s meeting with leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee. Law minister Nisith Adhikary and Trinamul Congress MLA Kalyan Banerjee were also present during the meeting at the chief minister?s Assembly chamber.

 Briefing reporters later, Banerjee said he tried to convince Bhattacharjee about its adverse impacts. ?I think I succeeded in convincing the chief minister that the bill is anti-people? If made a law, it would deny justice to rural people. We are thankful to the chief minister for deferring the introduction of the bill...? Banerjee said.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Probodh Chandra Sinha said the chief minister ?felt more discussions were required at various levels before the bill was tabled?. 

 The shalishi bill, which the Opposition had said would create a quasi-judicial system controlled by the CPM-dominated panchayats, was tabled in the Assembly on December 28, triggering an Opposition uproar. But it was not discussed in the House as the government cited the devastation wreaked by the December 26 tsunami to defer proceedings.

 The bill was also sent to the Assembly?s select committee after Trinamul and the Congress raised objections to some of its provisions. But the panel referred it back to the House for a general discussion. 

 Observers felt the CPM was hesitant to push the bill fearing a backlash from rural Bengal ahead of the Assembly polls. It is learnt that sections of the Left Front and the CPM itself were opposed to it.

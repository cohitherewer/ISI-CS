 Balding cops blow whistle on caps 

 - Uneasy lie the heads that wear the beret in burdwan

 Burdwan, July 3: Policemen here are tearing their hair off, if they have any left.

 Donning the beret for long hours, they are convinced, have robbed them of their youth err? its mascot, their hair. 

 With 24 out of 33 police station officers-in-charge having fallen victim to baldness, the fear of it is stalking the district force.

 About a fifth of the patients who visit the dermatology department of Burdwan Medical College and Hospital with complaints of hair loss are policemen ? from constables to the deputy superintendent. Almost 70 per cent of them have already turned bald, said a skin specialist.

 The law-enforcers of Burdwan, however, are not the only ones to have cried foul against the most distinctive emblem of their authority. In the US, women soldiers had also expressed concern over the impact berets had on their hair. 

 The head of the dermatology department at the medical college, Anita Choudhury, said the hair loss could be a result of wearing the berets for long. The hair remains soaked in sweat and develops dandruff at the roots, which eventually leads to hair loss and baldness. There is a need to change the main component (felt) used in the berets, she said.

 Some of them have found a ready remedy, wigs. 

 But whether or not the men here consider the US women their co-sufferers, soldier-cosmetologist J. Gordinez says in response to complaints of hair loss ? in Soldiers ? a cloth lining between the felt and the hair may help.

 The officers-in-charge of Raina and Coke Oven police stations, the Ketugram inspector-in-charge and a sub-inspector of the district intelligence branch, Durgapur, are among those who have taken to the false hair to conceal their shining pates. 

 I dont have any hair left on my head because of the beret and have been forced to use a wig, said Dilip Ganguly, the Ketugram inspector. 

 They may be told that berets are considered a fashionable way of concealing baldness in Europe. Again, especially by women.

 Bimal Bhanja, the district secretary of the non-gazetted police personnels union, said: Doctors have alerted us about the ill-effects of the felt berets; we will take the problem up with higher officials and urge them to alter the stuff used to make them. 

 Pintu Mukherjee, the Coke Oven OC, hoped that his bosses would do the needful to solve the problem. Nabyendu De of Raina said he did not want to take chances and opted for the wig before he lost all his hair.

 District superintendent of police Niraj Singh, however, said he had not given much thought to the problem. The state police commission has the final say on uniform. It consults us only before introducing changes, he said. 

 Late hours, irregular food habits, gastritis, asthma and heart diseases are affecting policemen, Singh said. But we should also be careful about hair loss.

 He had a point. Alakendu Ghosh, the head of the Burdwan medical colleges medicine department, said: Odd duty hours lead to digestion problems, which accelerate hair loss. The felt in the berets prevents air circulation and aggravates the problem.

 It appears from letters to a US soldiers magazine that like the policemen in Burdwan, the US hunks, too, detest their he-adgear. But the bosses there are lenient and they are mostly expected to wear them when a photographer is around.

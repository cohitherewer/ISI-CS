 Fugitive swears by law

 - I am not fleeing, says minister leaving Calcutta

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Narayan Biswas: Cocky?

 Calcutta, Oct. 30: Fugitive minister Narayan Biswas said tonight he will surrender if the high court rejects his bail prayer on November 7.

 I am a law-abiding citizen. I have already moved the court praying for anticipatory bail, which will be heard on November 7. If it is rejected, I will be left with no option but to surrender, Biswas told The Telegraph over phone.

 Under pressure from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the minister of state for cottage and small-scale industries said he would step down immediately after being put behind bars. I am not a fool. I cannot continue as a minister if I am taken into custody, he added.

 Biswas, who came to the city on Friday to meet senior CPM leaders and discuss the course of action before a likely surrender, left for hometown Balurghat today. 

 Before leaving, the man who has evaded court for 16 years despite having an arrest warrant against him, thundered: Dont think that I am fleeing the city. I have a lot of engagements in my constituency. I will be back here in a day or two.

 Biswas regretted that stories were being cooked up by the media about his surrender. I am not evading arrest, nor am I absconding. I am strictly adhering to the law of the land, he said.

 The high court will hear Biswass anticipatory bail plea on reopening after the Puja break on November 7. How can I surrender until my bail prayer is heard? he asked. 

 He denied reports of the CPM leaderships advice to surrender immediately. Biswas said: I am a conscientious person and I know what to do if I am wanted by police in connection with old cases. 

 Biswas is among 89 CPM supporters accused of burning down 22 houses at Ratanpur of South Dinajpur in 1988. He features on the Election Commissions list of voters who police say are absconding.

 Now arrest him, says Opposition

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 31: Minutes after Narayan Biswas sent in his papers, the Opposition parties joined forces to demand his immediate arrest.

 Biswas should have been sacked and arrested a long time back. He has been evading arrest since 1989. What was police doing all this while? asked Mamata Banerjee. 

 The resignation is a farce. We demand the minister be put behind bars immediately as he is charged with a non-bailable offence, she added. 

 Leader of the Opposition in the Assembly and Trinamul Congress MLA Pankaj Banerjee accused the chief minister of indulging criminals. 

 We wonder how a person like Biswas could be provided a police escort. Instead, he should have been in police custody, Banerjee said. 

 From Balurghat, the man in the centre of the storm called the heat the hazard of being a communist. Biswas added that he was getting ready to go to jail in a day or two. 

 Former state Congress chief and MLA Somen Mitra carried forward the Trinamul tirade. Why is he still at large? he asked. He should have been in a lock-up by now.

 Mitra added that the party would soon decide Behrampore MP Adhir Chowdhury and his wife Arpitas course of action. The couple is wanted in connection with a twin murder in July. 

 Chowdhury will be present in Behrampore town with Union water resource minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and party MP from Malda A.B.A. Ghani Khan Choudhury to take part in a law-violation programme, Mitra said. 

 Chowdhury told The Telegraph from Delhi that he would go by the partys decision. I will act in accordance with the leaderships guidelines. I have already discussed the issue with senior leaders, including Pranabda (defence minister and state party president Pranab Mukherjee).

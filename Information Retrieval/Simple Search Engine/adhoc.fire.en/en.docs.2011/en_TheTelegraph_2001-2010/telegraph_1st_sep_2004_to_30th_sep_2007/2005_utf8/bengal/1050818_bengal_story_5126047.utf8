 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, Aug. 17: Police have been clueless about a nine-year-old boy missing since Sunday, but a ransom call last night gave them a lead.

 Supen Biswas, a Class IV student, had gone to watch a football match in in Krishnagunj village, 120 km from Calcutta, and did not return home. His father, a farmer, lodged a complaint but did not mention any suspect, leaving the police grappling for clues. 

 However, in the last 24 hours, Sunil Biswas received a series of calls demanding a ransom of Rs 1 lakh for his sons release. He identified one of the callers as Momin Sheikh, his one-time business partner. 

 Calcutta: Nearly 300 residents of Harijan Palli in Ramgarh staged a demonstration in front of mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharyas house on Wednesday. The protesters, who used to work in the government houses in the locality that have been pulled down, demanded their rehabilitation and restoration of water and electricity supply in the shanties where they have put up. 

 Calcutta: Calcutta High Court has fined Milli-Al Amin College, which prevented a teacher from joining work saying she was a threat to the minority community. Justice P.K. Chattopaddhaya directed the college at Beniapukur in east Calcutta to appoint Baisakhi Banerjee within seven days of obtaining a copy of the order. The college authority will also have to pay a fine of Rs 5,100 to the petitioner as the cost of the case, he added.

 Chinsurah: Charged with murdering his parents, Sujit Kundu had to spend three months in Chinsurah jail only to be let off last week after the real killers confessed to the crime. On September 7 last year, Sujit had come home to find his parents lying in a pool of blood. Immediately, the police came and took me to the police station for interrogation, he said. 

 Calcutta: Probodh Purkait, the SUCI legislator from Kultali who was convicted in a case of twin murders, will surrender before Alipore court on Friday. Purkait, a nine-time MLA from Kultali, will also cease to be a member of the Assembly.

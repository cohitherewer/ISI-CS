 Church raiders

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 5: A day after the church at Jalalkhali in Nadia was looted and vandalised, police picked up a local youth, the second to be held.

 Basudeb Biswas was arrested from a hideout in Hanskhali, 15 km from the church, this morning. He was caught following the interrogation of Nandadulal Mondal. Both had been accused of theft earlier.

 Local youths out to avenge Fr Antony Kariyattils campaign against their alcohol abuse and eve-teasing allegedly raided the church, 75 km from Calcutta, on Saturday night. The burglars burnt the communion bread and pages of the Bible after ransacking a storeroom adjacent to the prayer hall. 

 District magistrate Rajesh Pandey said: Those arrested have said that they had no intention of burning the Bible. It was dark inside and they did not know what book it was.

 The Bangiya Christiya Pariseba asked Pandey and the district police chief to ensure safety and security of the community with less than three weeks to go for Christmas.

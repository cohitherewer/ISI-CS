 Mobile tiff drives teenager to death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Suri, Aug. 2: Nineteen-year-old Shatabdi Ghoshal committed suicide last night after a tiff with her mother over buying a mobile phone.

 A BA second year student at Vidyasagar College here, she was the only child of her parents. She was very sentimental and we rarely refused her anything she asked for, said Dilip Ghoshal, her father, a fire brigade employee stationed at Nabadwip, Nadia.

 At her home in the Barabagan area of Suri town, about 230 km from Calcutta, Shatabdi hanged herself from the ceiling of her room after a quarrel with her mother over possessing the phone.

 Ghoshal said she had been demanding it over the past few months. I assured her I would give her one but it would take some time. We talked about it only a couple of days ago, said the father, breaking down in tears.

 Cases of suicide by teenagers after being denied their objects of desire are not rare any more. 

 In June, a Class IV boy hanged himself in Kalyani, Nadia, after not being allowed to watch the steamy Mallika Sherawat film, Murder, by his parents. The same day, another boy, a Class II student of Hanskhali in Nadia, committed suicide after being refused a slice of hilsa by his mother. The piece he had selected for himself had gone to his brother.

 In this world of consumerism, boys and girls are heavily influenced and in most cases, they get what they want. This over indulgence by parents make them very sensitive? to such an extent that they cannot take no for an answer, said R. Ghosh Roy, a Calcutta-based psychiatrist.

 Birbhum additional superintendent of police Swapan Kumar Maity said: It appears that Shatabdi committed suicide because she did not get the phone. The body has been sent for post-mortem.

 Yesterday, Shatabdi again discussed her demand with her mother and an altercation began. After that she marched into her study and locked the door from inside. After several hours, her mother became tense. She knocked on the door repeatedly but there was no response. The neighbours were alerted, a police officer said.

 They broke open the door. Shatabdi was hanging from the ceiling with a dupatta tied around her neck. She was rushed to the sadar hospital, where she was declared dead.

 Hearing about it, her mother fell ill. Her father was informed in Nabadwip and he rushed in late at night.

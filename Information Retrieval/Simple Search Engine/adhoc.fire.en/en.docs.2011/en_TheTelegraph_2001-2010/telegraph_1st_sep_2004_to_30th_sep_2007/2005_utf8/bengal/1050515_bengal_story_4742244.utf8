 Role reversal for angry cops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 14: Policemen, often called to drive away relatives of patients protesting against doctors negligence, staged a demonstration at Calcutta Police Hospital today alleging that one of their colleagues died because of neglect. 

 The angry lawkeepers asked the authorities to explain why none of the doctors attended to constable Mrinal Pal Chowdhury even after he complained of a breathing problem minutes before his death.

 Hospital superintendent D.P. Acharya said he would look into the allegations. It will also be checked whether there was negligence on the part of hospital authorities.

 According to police, the hospital premises turned tense around 11 am after Pal Chowdhury, who was with the West Port police station, died. He was admitted a week ago with acute pain in the chest. After preliminary treatment, his condition was said to be stable, a hospital official said.

 Pal Chowdhurys condition worsened this morning. He complained of pain in the chest again and found it difficult to breathe. There was no nurse in his ward. Pal Chowdhury was gasping. Other patients sought help for him but neither doctors nor hospital staff were around, said an officer of the West Port police station.

 Seeing Pal Chowdhury groaning, fellow patients went to the doctors room. 

 They told a doctor about his condition, said a policeman who participated in the demonstration. But the doctor sent them back saying he will attend to Pal Chowdhury only after receiving an intimation from a nurse. Even after repeated requests, the doctor did not pay any heed.

 The patients returned to see Pal Chowdhury dead. He had stopped groaning by then. All the patients in the room realised he was dead, said another officer. 

 A doctor came after 10 minutes only to declare Pal Chowdhury dead, officially.

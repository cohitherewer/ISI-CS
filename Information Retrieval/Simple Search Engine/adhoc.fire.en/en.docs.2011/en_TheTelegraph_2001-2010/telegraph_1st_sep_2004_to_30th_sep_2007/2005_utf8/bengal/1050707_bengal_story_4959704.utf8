 Subrata spits fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 6: Subrata Mukherjee today said he left the Trinamul Congress when he realised that he would not be made mayor if the party was voted to power in the June 19 civic elections.

 Subrata, who broke away from Mamata Banerjee to form the Paschim Banga Unnanyan Mancha, said: Mamata wanted to win the elections cashing in on my good work as mayor for the last five years and then throw me into the dustbin. She had a plan to choose her own man as mayor. 

 He added that the Mamata magic failed to woo voters in last months polls. Though 42 Trinamul nominees were elected, the percentage of votes has gone down.

 Mamata refused to be dragged into the controversy. But Trinamul all-India general secretary Mukul Roy hit back at the former mayor. 

 Subratas statements have caught him on the wrong foot. He has exposed himself to the people by revealing that he was solely eyeing the mayors post, he said.

 In a move that will further sour his relations with Mamatas party, Subrata today lodged a complaint with the principal secretary of the Assembly against his long-time friend in the trade union movement, Sovandeb Chattopadhayay, also Trinamuls chief whip in the House.

 He alleged, in a two-page letter, that Chattopadhaya was drawing pension from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation as its former employee as well as taking salary and allowances from the Assembly as Trinamul MLA from Rashbehari. This is unethical, he wrote.

 Subrata has also sent a copy of the letter to governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi.

 Asked why he did not protest against this illegal act during his tenure as mayor, Mukherjee said it did not come to his notice. 

 Chattopadhaya returned Subratas fire by alleging that the former mayor had willingly remained silent to avoid incurring the wrath of party workers. 

 Political observers feel Subrata has risked political oblivion by straining relations with Mamata. 

 The Congress, eyeing a tie-up with the Trinamul, said: We will not be able to re-nominate Subrata from Chowringhee if Mamata opposes it.

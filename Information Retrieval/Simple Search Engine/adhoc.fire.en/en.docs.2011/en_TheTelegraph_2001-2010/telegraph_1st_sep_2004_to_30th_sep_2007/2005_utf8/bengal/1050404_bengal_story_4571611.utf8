 Home minister date with China gate 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Gangtok, April 2: Union home minister Shivraj Patil will tomorrow visit Nathu-la, the pass leading to China that has remained closed since the war with the neighbour in 1962.

 The trip to the gateway, at an altitude of over 14,000 ft, assumes special significance as Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao is coming to India later this week.

 During then Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayee?s visit to China in 2003, the two sides had decided to open the trade point at Nathu-la. South Block had interpreted China?s acceptance of Nathu-la as the Indian trade point as Beijing?s first step towards recognising Sikkim as an integral part of India.

 The Chinese leader?s visit, the home minister told a news conference at Raj Bhavan here, would ?give a chance for both the sides to discuss all important issues?.

 His inauguration of the Palzor stadium and the state dinner with Sikkim chief minister Pawan Chamling were struck off the schedule today because of the Pope?s death. 

 Patil, accompanied by his deputy Manik Rao Gavit, senior ministry officials and family members, will make the Nathu-la trip tomorrow. 

 The Centre is open to Sikkim?s demand for a ?peace bonus? of Rs 1,000 crore, the home minister said.

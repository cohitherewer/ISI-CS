 Calcutta, June 18: Air-India marked an historic moment when its maiden non-stop flight to London took off this afternoon.

 This is historic both for Calcutta and Air-India, said civil aviation minister Praful Patel.

 The flight will operate on the Delhi-Dhaka-Calcutta-London route thrice a week ? Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

 The minister also unveiled a plan to strengthen the citys air connectivity as part of the all-round development of the country and open a new terminal at the N.S.C. Bose International Airport. 

 This is an age of tough competition. No airline can compromise with passenger facilities. At the same time, fares will also have to be competitive, said Patel. 

 Air-India is offering a Calcutta-London round trip ticket for Rs 25,810 in the economy class, he added. The attractive introductory fare is valid till July 31, the minister said.

 Passengers will get state-of-the-art facilities on this new flight, which is a Boeing 777-200 aircraft. Apart from flat bed-type seats in the First Class category, in-arm-video systems with LCD display and multi-channel audio systems are available in all classes, said V. Thulasidas, Air-Indias chairman and managing director.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who delivered the keynote address before the flight was flagged off, lauded Air-India. Im happy that this flight was launched.

 He, however, lamented that Bengal is being neglected by the Centre in the aviation sector. The highest foreign direct investment in Bengal comes from Japan. But there is no flight directly connecting this state with the land of the sun. Ive requested the civil aviation minister to introduce at least four flights directly connecting this state to Frankfurt, Paris, China and Japan. 

 Patel, too, admitted that much has to be done in the aviation sector. Lots of major Indian cities with huge populations have still very poor air connectivity. Most of the air traffic is now concentrated in Mumbai and Delhi. We want to distribute the traffic evenly across the country, he said.

 Declaring that the next decade would be the decade of aviation, the minister said a record 26 per cent overall growth in the aviation sector was registered last year. We will have to see that this growth rate sustains.

 Patel said work on the new terminal at the N.S.C. Bose International Airport would start in 2006. 

 It would follow a model presented by authorities of Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris. We will show it to the state government once the final report of CDG for the new terminal is ready, the minister said.

 An airport in Coochbehar is also in the offing, he added. I was told work on the new airport in Coochbehar will start soon. 

 At a Ficci meeting today, Patel indicated that the possibility of a second airport in the city is remote. He added that the revamped Calcutta airport would be enough to cater to passengers for another 15-20 years.

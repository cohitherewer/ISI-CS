 Police bullets fell youth 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Krishnagar, Feb. 2: Shots rang out on National Highway 34 last night as police chased a fleeing truck and a car, resulting in the death of a youth. Differing versions of why the police shot at the car has led the Nadia superintendent of police, Benoy Chakraborty, to order an inquiry. 

 Though a section of the police claimed Kanauj Mondal was killed in an encounter, Bankim Ghosh, the CPM MLA of Haringhata, where Mondal lived, asserted the party activist was an honest transport operator and called him ?innocent?. 

 Several hundred angry residents and CPM supporters today put up roadblocks on an arterial road linking the highway with Kalyani Expressway near Jagulia, holding up traffic for over two hours. A large police contingent rushed to the spot and persuaded the protesters to lift the roadblock. 

 Police officials said around 9 pm yesterday, a mini truck collided with an Ambassador at Panchpota in Chakdah, 60 km from Calcutta. Before police arrived, the truck driver had fled ? it seems to inform Mondal. Police seized the two vehicles. It left the truck on the road and towed the car to the police station after admitting the driver to hospital. 

 When they returned, the truck had disappeared. They traced it racing towards Jagulia, escorted by an Ambassador. The policemen chased and shouted at them to pull up. 

 Here, the versions get hazy. ?The Chakdah police told me that instead of abiding by the order, the car, carrying three to four occupants, picked up speed and fired at the police vehicle, prompting the police to open fire. Kanauj Mondal, who was in the car, was killed,? said superintendent Chakraborty. 

 He said he has also heard another police version, where it is not clear why the firing started. ?A probe has been ordered into the death,? he said. 

 The car with Mondal?s body was found abandoned at a petrol pump. The others in the car have not been traced. 

 MLA Ghosh accepted that Mondal, who owned the truck, could have been speeding to escape police harassment, but was firm that he could not have opened fire.

 Global tender for mart makeover

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 1: The management of the city?s mega flower mart, Mullickghat, is set to float global tenders for the construction of a proposed complex that would include an auction centre, snazzy display windows and a cafeteria overlooking the Hooghly.

 Work on the project, estimated to cost about Rs 20 crore, should begin by the beginning of the Bengali new year in mid-April.

 Sudhansu Sil, the chairman of the market?s governing body, said: ?We have already turned Mullickghat Phoolbazar Parichalan Samity into a registered body and Calcutta Port Trust has officially transferred the land through the state government.? 

 The central Agricultural Product Export Development Agency has offered financial support for the makeover of the flower mart into a complex of international standards.

 Besides florists? stalls, it will house grading, sorting and storing units, units for extraction of essential oils, a guesthouse for foreign buyers and a revolving restaurant. 

 Flowers worth Rs 1 crore were exported from the state in 2004. Sil, who took the initiative to make flowers from Bengal available internationally, said the first consignment of tuberose, cockscomb and zarbera will be despatched to Japan next week. The Mullickghat management has already established trade links with the Netherlands, UK and the US.

 Japanese scholar Kazuo Azuma, who was conferred the Desikottama by Visva-Bharati, met Sailen Sarkar, the minister for food processing and agri-horticulure, on Thursday and expressed his interest in popularising roses from Bengal in his country. 

 Sil said Bengal comes after Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in flower production with 6,500 tonnes of annual produce.

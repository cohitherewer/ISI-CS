 BRIEFS

 Durgapur, May 20: Relatives of a patient at Ukhra town in Andal beat up a doctor and ransacked a nursing home this morning after she died because of negligence.

 Manorama Sarkar, 30, had given birth to a girl after a Caesarean section, but complained of pain and bled since the delivery. Her husband Bikash Sarkar, an Eastern Coalfields Ltd employee, lodged an FIR against the gynaecologist and the nursing home alleging negligence. The Burdwan police chief said: We have received the complaint, but cannot arrest the doctor unless we get a report from a medical board that will investigate the charge.

 A police team rescued the accused doctor and a nurse from the nursing home, about 230 km from Calcutta.

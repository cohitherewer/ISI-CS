 Coal protesters knock out OC

 - Battlefield Bengal: shots, stones fly in 12-hour fury 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Durgapur, Feb. 2: A police officer standing in for a colleague on leave lost a tooth and had his skull cracked this morning when protesters at a coal mine clashed with the law enforcers. 

 Debjyoti Saha, the officer-in-charge of Pandaveswar police station with additional responsibility of Andal, fell unconscious under the blows and is under observation in a serious condition in hospital. A constable was also injured in the brick-batting. 

 Yesterday, another constable and officer were injured when a mob targeted them in North 24-Parganas. 

 The project office of Eastern Coalfields Limited?s open-cast Jambad mine, about 250 km from Calcutta, turned into a battlefield this morning when a mob, led by local CPI leaders, went on the rampage in protest against the company?s decision to hire ex-army men from an agency as security guards. 

 The people, who had been demanding employment as guards, gheraoed the project manager and the mine agent for more than two hours after wrecking the office. 

 When Saha and his force reached the spot to rescue the ECL staff, the mob began hurling stones. Saha was hit on the forehead and face and collapsed, his face a bloody mess. Police reinforcements and Rapid Action Force personnel were sent in. 

 Burdwan police superintendent .K. Singh said the force resorted to lathicharge and fired two rounds when it came under attack. Thirty-three people have been arrested. ?We have received reports that two local CPI leaders, Manju Bose and R.C. Singh, instigated the villagers. We are looking into the reports and will not hesitate to arrest them,? Singh said. 

 The mine authorities said they had employed local people, but they failed to check coal theft. Last night, they apparently beat up the new guards and snatched a gun. 

 Bose, a member of the zilla parishad in charge of land and land revenue, complained of police high-handedness last night and threatened to continue the agitation till the villagers were released.

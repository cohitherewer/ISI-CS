 Panel to look into frequent VC shift

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Santiniketan, Nov. 5: A three-member committee probing the students unrest that rocked Visva-Bharati in September will also look into the circumstances under which most of the universitys vice-chancellors have had to leave before completing their tenure. 

 Besides the reasons behind students unrest, we shall also probe why some vice- chancellors had to quit without completing their five-year tenure, said Narayan Chandra Seal, a former high court judge, who is heading the committee.

 The other committee members are Haripada Roy, a retired IAS officer, and Col (retd) Kali Prasad Ghosh.

 University records show that after 1951, most of the vice-chancellors left office before their terms ended.

 Seal said the committee will issue a notice tomorrow inviting people to give their views in writing regarding the 12-day strike by students in September. 

 Asked when the committee would submit the report, Seal said: We shall try to complete the probe within three months and the report will be submitted in January. 

 The committee will not spare even the varsity authorities if there are lapses on their part, he added.

 He said the committee will examine the views sent by people and talk to students, teachers and even outsiders during the probe.

 Those ashramites who are aged and will not be able to come before the committee physically, our members will approach them for their views, said the former judge. Seal said the committee will suggest measures to avert students unrest on the university campus.

 Jumbo chase in vain

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 Calcutta, April 6: A team of two that went to Purulia to hunt a rogue elephant has returned empty-handed. 

 The elephant, which has been wreaking havoc for the past nine months, crossed over to neighbouring Jharkhand last night, the hunters claimed. The tusker had been roaming the jungles in Bankura, Purulia and Midnapore. 

 The state forest department declared it a ?rogue? on March 16 after it killed three persons ? all in Bankura district. The department appointed hunters Chanchal Sarkar and Ranjit Mukherjee to shoot the animal. The duo left Calcutta on Saturday night and camped in the forests for three days.

 ?This is the second case where we have failed. The last time we missed our target was in 1995 when we could not trace a rogue elephant in the Dooars,? Sarkar said. 

 ?Last night, we went to a forest near Lohadag near the Bengal-Jharkhand border to look for the animal. But we are certain the elephant has crossed over to Jharkhand where the forest is more dense than in Purulia,? said Mukherjee.

 The district forest officer of Purulia, Ashok Chakraborty, said patrolling is still on in the core forest area.

 Rejig with eye on polls

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 11: An 85-member state committee, which includes eight new faces, was formed at the Kamarhati conclave that would close with a session at Brigade Parade Grounds tomorrow. 

 The CPM did not bring about any major change while reconstituting the state committee, keeping an eye on next year?s Assembly elections. 

 But the conference witnessed the growing importance of commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen in the party. He would now don the mantle of party treasurer, a ?sensitive? post so long held by Anil Biswas. 

 It is said that the party brass relieved Biswas of the burden in view of the polls. 

 The reconstituted committee has functionaries from the party?s youth, trade union, peasants? and women?s wings. The committee will constitute the new secretariat, the highest decision-making body. 

 Notable among those dropped from the panel were Somnath Chatterjee, Chittabrata Majumdar, Biplab Dasgupta and Ramnarayan Goswami. 

 Chatterjee has become the Lok Sabha Speaker, Majumdar was assigned to look after Citu ? the CPM?s labour arm ? in Delhi and Goswami was inducted into the control commission, the party?s vigilance wing. Dasgupta was dropped on health grounds. 

 Chatterjee, Majumdar and Dasgupta are also the party?s central committee members.

 Only seven women figure in the 85-member panel. Six years ago, Brinda Karat had walked out of the party congress in Calcutta demanding more women in the organisation.

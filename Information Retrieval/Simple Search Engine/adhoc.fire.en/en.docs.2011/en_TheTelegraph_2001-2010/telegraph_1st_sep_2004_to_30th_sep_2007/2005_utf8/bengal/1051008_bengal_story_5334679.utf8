 Minister case to start afresh

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 7: The high court today decided to recall its earlier order granting anticipatory bail to minister of state Narayan Biswas in connection with a 17-year-old case of arson, observing that the prosecution had suppressed vital facts during yesterdays hearing.

 The division bench of Justices A.K. Basu and P.K. Deb sent the matter to Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar for reassignment before an appropriate bench of the court.

 With painful hearts, we are recalling the order passed by us yesterday granting anticipatory bail to Narayan Biswas and other persons, to maintain dignity of this court and to save judicial propriety. We are referring this matter to the Chief Justice for assignment to an appropriate bench, the bench said.

 The judges also expressed displeasure over additional public prosecutor, Ashimesh Goswami, who allegedly did not assist the court properly during the hearing of the case relating to the ministers bail.

 We keep trust on you (lawyers). As far as I can recall, you (Goswami) did not utter a single word during the hearing of the case yesterday that the petitioner (Biswas) was absconding for 17 years after the trial court issued a warrant of arrest against him, the judge said.

 Y. Dastoor, the lawyer who represented Biswas yesterday, wanted to say something. But an angry Justice Basu said: Dont try to spell out a single word.

 Lawyers for the state said a bench could not recall its order on the basis of the allegation by the lawyers of de facto complainants (victims of the incident). Yesterday, Biswas and others obtained bail while the plea of another Narayan Biswas, a resident of Murshidabad, was rejected.

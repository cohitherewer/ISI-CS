 BRIEFS

 Durgapur, Feb. 28: An elephant from Radurbedia forest travelled 1.5 km out of it into a Bankura village last night and mauled two. 

 Phatik Bauri, 40, was thrown in the air and then trampled upon. Chuni Bala Nandi, 60, met with much the same fate. A force from the Gangajalghati police station and forest officials chased the animal into the jungle, about 240 km from Calcutta. ?A herd from Dalma forest in Jharkhand has been roaming the jungles here for years,? said the divisional forest officer. 

 Krishnagar: Forty children taking mid-day meal at Ramchandrapur Primary School in Tehatta, 180 km from Calcutta, took ill on Monday apparently after inhaling insecticide being sprayed at a banana grove. The children, suffering from nausea, were taken to a health centre, where four had to be admitted.

 Behrampore: Rakhi Khatoon, 12, who went missing last Wednesday, was found dead near her home at Phoolpur in Murshidabad, 250 km from Calcutta. District police chief Sanjoy Singh said she was probably raped first. 

 Ranaghat: Mantu Barui, who was to take this year?s HS exams, was arrested on Sunday for allegedly kidnapping a classmate. Police said Sangita Banerjee, 18, of Ranaghat, 65 km from Calcutta, was picked on her way to tuitions. Intelligence officials spotted Mantu, who was named as a suspect by Sangita?s father, at a Bethuadahari bus stand. Police are probing if she is part of a girl-running ring. 

 Calcutta: Sanjib Sarkar, 27, a Raj Bhavan employee, set himself afire at his quarters on the premises on Monday evening. His family members rescued him and took him to Medical College and Hospital.

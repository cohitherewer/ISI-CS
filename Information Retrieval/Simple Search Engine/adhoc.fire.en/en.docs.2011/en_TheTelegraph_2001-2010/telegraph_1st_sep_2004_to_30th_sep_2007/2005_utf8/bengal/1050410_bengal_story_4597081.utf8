 Hawker returns bag with lakh

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 9: A railway hawker last night returned a briefcase carrying Rs 1.07 lakh in notes found in a compartment of a local train, proving his honesty in a time when passengers? belongings are frequently stolen at railway stations and in trains.

 Mahadeb Sau, a resident of Baruipara-Shyampur area was hawking in a Howrah-bound Seoraphuli local around 10.30 pm when ?he found the briefcase in a compartment between Seoraphuli and Serampore stations?, said an Eastern Railway official.

 The hawker deposited the briefcase, belonging to Kuldeep Singhal, a businessman from Uttarpara in Hooghly, at the Serampore Government Railway Police outpost.

 ?Sau sells bags in local trains in the Seoraphuli-Howrah section. His financial condition is extremely unstable,? said a GRP official. 

 Singhal was contacted and the bag returned to him. The businessman promised to reward the hawker. ?The businessman said he would ensure that Sau gets a job,? said a railway official.

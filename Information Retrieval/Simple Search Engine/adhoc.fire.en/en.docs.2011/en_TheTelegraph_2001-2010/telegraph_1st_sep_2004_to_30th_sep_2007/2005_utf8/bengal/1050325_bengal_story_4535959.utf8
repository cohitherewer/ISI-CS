 Love price 

 Shantipur (Nadia), March 24: A woman, believed to be a sex worker, was thrashed by a group of people who also poured acid on her private parts as punishment for having an affair with a local youth.

 Rani Khatun had begun to plan a life beyond flesh trade and stopped entertaining clients after she fell in love with Gautam Halder, a small trader whom she met in the brothel. 

 Gautam, who lives with his family in a colony nearby, went back on the marriage proposal recently. An NGO, which lodged a police complaint on behalf of Rani, said she wanted to marry him and leave the brothel where the owner tortured her. Last night, she was called to Gautam?s house, where his family members and some neighbours locked her in a room, beat her and poured the acid as she fell unconscious.

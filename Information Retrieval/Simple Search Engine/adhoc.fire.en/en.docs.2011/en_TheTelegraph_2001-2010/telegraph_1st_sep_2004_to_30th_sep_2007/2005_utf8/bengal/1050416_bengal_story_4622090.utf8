 Green rein on project

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Calcutta, April 15: In an affidavit before the Supreme Court, the state pollution control board today said the Chandernagore municipal corporation should not destroy water bodies or fell trees while developing a residential-cum-commercial complex.

 The project in Mankundu, 50 km from Calcutta, includes a women?s polytechnic.

 Earlier, Mankundu residents had filed a public interest litigation in Calcutta High Court against the project which, they said, would lead to environmental degradation. The area, they said, was full of trees like mahogany and mango and banana and litchi orchards. 

 When the high court ruled in favour of the project, the residents moved the apex court. 

 Biswajit Mukherjee, a law officer for the pollution board, said: ?The Supreme Court had asked us to form a committee and submit a detailed report on the project.? The board said the corporation has not submitted the project?s environment impact assessment.

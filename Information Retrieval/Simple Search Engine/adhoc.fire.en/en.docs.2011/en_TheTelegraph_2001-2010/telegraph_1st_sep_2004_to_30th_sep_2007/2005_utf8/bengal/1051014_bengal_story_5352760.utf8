 Ex-MP alleges Bloc plot to kill

 OUR BUREAU

 Behrampore/Calcutta, Oct. 13: A day after a Forward Bloc supporter was held in a Murshidabad village and a cache of arms was found in his possession, expelled party leader and former MP Jayanta Roy alleged that his former colleagues had hired Idris Ali to kill him.

 Ali was picked up from his house at Islampur, about 225 km from Calcutta. Two pipe-guns, a musket and six bombs were found there. 

 He was offered Rs 60,000 by three Bloc leaders for my murder. He has revealed the plot to police during interrogation, Roy said. 

 The police refused to confirm that. District superintendent Niraj Kumar Singh said he had received a complaint from former agriculture marketing minister and expelled Bloc leader Chhaya Ghosh. We are looking into it. 

 Roy said he had informed the CPM brass in Calcutta about the threat to his life. CPM leader and Left Front chairman Biman Bose today admitted that Roy had contacted him.

 Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh denied Roys allegations. Idris Ali was never a member of our party. He is a criminal, he said. However, Bibhas Chakraborty, the Blocs district secretary admitted that he knew Ali as a partyman.

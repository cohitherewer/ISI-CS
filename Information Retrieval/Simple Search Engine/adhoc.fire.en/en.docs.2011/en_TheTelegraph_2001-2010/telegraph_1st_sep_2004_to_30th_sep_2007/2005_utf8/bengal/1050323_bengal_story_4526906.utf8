 Teen mom stands by husband

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 22: An 18-year-old, arrested for marrying when she was a minor, today stood by her husband to tell the high court that she had not been kidnapped by him, as her father had alleged. 

 Pinki Gupta had married Raju Khan, a Muslim youth, when she was around 17. 

 Today, Justice Pranab Kumar Chatterjee asked Pinki to approach the Asansol subdivisional judicial magistrate and request him to allow her to stay with her husband.

 The order followed a petition by Raju, 22, who had moved high court alleging that police and the authorities of Liluah Home ? where Pinki was sent ? were not allowing him to meet Pinki and their four-month-old son. The judge told the police and the home to produce Pinki in court.

 He asked Pinki if Raju had forced her to marry him to which she said: ?Nobody forced me to take the decision.? 

 She told the court she would like to stay with Raju.

 According to a school certificate, Pinki was 17 years and nine months when she married. ?You have now crossed 18 years... So, I think now you have the right to ask the court to release you from the home,? Justice Chatterjee said. 

 Pinki?s father Vikram had lodged a complaint with Kulti police alleging that Raju had abducted his minor daughter.

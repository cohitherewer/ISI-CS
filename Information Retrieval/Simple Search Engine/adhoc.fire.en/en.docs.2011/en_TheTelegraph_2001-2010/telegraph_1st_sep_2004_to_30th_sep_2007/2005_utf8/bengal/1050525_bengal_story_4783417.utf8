 Speaker action looms on Subrata

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta, May 24: Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim has decided to showcause Subrata Mukherjee for contesting the civic polls on the clock symbol of the Nationalist Congress Party despite being a Trinamul Congress MLA.

 Defection is highly immoral. Subrata should have resigned from Trinamul before contesting the elections on the NCPs symbol, Halim said. 

 The decision follows an appeal by legislators from Mamata Banerjees party. Trinamul MLAs led by leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee called on the Speaker this afternoon and petitioned him to cancel the Chowringhee MLAs membership. Subrata won the 2001 Assembly elections on a Trinamul ticket. He should be barred from contesting the June 19 polls under the defection law. How can he fight an election on the NCPs symbol? Banerjee asked reporters. 

 Asked about Mukherjees defection to Trinamul from the Congress, he said: Let us talk about the present. 

 Halim said he will decide the course of action after getting the mayors reply.

 Mukherjee said: The law will take its own course. Let me first get the notice. 

 In Katwa, Burdwan, prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC have been imposed following clashes between CPM and Congress supporters during and after Sundays municipal elections. 

 Congress leaders Somen Mitra and Pradip Bhattacharya met the chief minister at Writers Buildings today to point out the post-poll violence perpetrated by CPM workers.

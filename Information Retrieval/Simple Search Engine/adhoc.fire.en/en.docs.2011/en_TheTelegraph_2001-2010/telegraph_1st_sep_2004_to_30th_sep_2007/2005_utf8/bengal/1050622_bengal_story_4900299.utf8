 SBI pen-down hits north

 OUR BUREAU

 June 21: Trade and commerce in Siliguri, Malda and Cooch Behar were hit hard as employees at clearing houses managed by the State Bank of India struck work for the second day protesting against the transfer of 17 colleagues.

 Work in three clearing houses ? Siliguri, Malda and Cooch Behar ? and 16 SBI branches across north Bengal has been disrupted since yesterday following a pen-down by the employees owing allegiance to the SBI Staff Association. 

 In Siliguri alone, banking instruments (drafts and cheques) worth Rs 20 crore could not be cleared today.

 The employees are agitating against the transfer of 17 clerical staff from SBI branches across north Bengal. The union says the transfer orders were in violation of an agreement between the management and the SBI Staff Federation, the apex body of the employees. The management says that all the transfers were in accordance with the pact.

 Though part of a statewide agitation, the stand-off has hit north Bengal hardest because SBI manages the clearing houses ? where representatives from various banks exchange banking instruments every morning ? on behalf of the Reserve Bank, which does not have an office in the region. 

 The SBI stalemate had a cascading effect on banks, nationalised and private. 

 Our customers are facing a lot of harassment because of the SBI problem, said Mukund Subba, the HDFC Bank branch manager in Siliguri. 

 The only option left for the banks to get their instruments cleared is to report directly to the particular branch of banks in whose favour they are drawn. On any given day, we have about 500 instruments, several of them in favour of outstation banks, deposited at our branch. It is impossible for us to reach out to all of them, Subba said.

 B.K. Singh, a hardware merchant, said: I deposited demand drafts worth Rs 4.2 lakh on Saturday hoping that they would be cleared by Monday and I would be able to make payments in Delhi. As the money was not credited, he was forced to cancel his trip to the capital.

 The union claimed the strike was aimed at improving the services in the long-term.

 Behrampore, Sept. 3: He was a terror for motorists and a headache for the administration, but hundreds gathered for a last glimpse on hearing the news of his death. Some even wept.

 Sambhu, the bull who had for 15 years spread panic in Behrampore town, about 200 km from Calcutta, died this morning as a result of an infection in his hoof and was given a funeral with fanfare.

 The 7-foot long bovine with horns almost a foot long inspired fear and awe among police officers and motorists, especially when VIPs came calling.

 Sambhu had an allergy to cars with flashing red lights and had, in February 2004, brought the chief ministers convoy to a halt by attempting a head-on charge. In June 2003, he had attacked a car carrying police personnel who were guarding him, while the chief minister held a meeting nearby. He even overturned a Maruti Omni belonging to a former municipality chairman.

 As news of the bulls death spread, hundreds of people flocked to see him. At 10.30 am, more than 150 members of the local Ranibagan Young Corner Club took out a procession, with Sambhus body draped in a red cloth in a matador bringing up the rear.

 A four-member team accompanied the matador, singing kirtans to the beats of drums and cymbals, as a microphone mounted on a rickshaw announced: Sambhu is not with us anymore. He breathed his last at 7 am. Sambhu amar rahe.

 The procession wound its way through Behrampore town for two hours.

 Sambhu was buried at Pharasdamga in the afternoon.

 The bull had mellowed and was nursing an infection in the hoof. He hardly moved around anymore, said Shankar Saha, a teastall owner.

 I was called his father. When I offered him a roti or biscuits, he followed me like an obedient child. Its better that he is dead. No one looked after him when he was suffering, said Shyamal Das, a resident of the area.

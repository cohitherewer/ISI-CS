 BSNL puja promise: no cell jam 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 10: Fed up being told that the network is busy or the number you called is not available?

 Well, CellOne subscribers troubled by such messages need not worry any more. Come pujas, the congestion in the Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limiteds mobile phone network will become a thing of the past as authorities have undertaken a plan to upgrade its network in Calcutta. 

 Unprecedented growth in the last 13 months and a continuous migration of customers from private operators has forced the authorities to decide on building 300 base transmitting stations.

 We will set up 300 base transmitting stations (BTS) in Calcutta, Salt Lake and adjoining areas in the coming three months, a senior CalTel official said yesterday. CellOne is the mobile phone service of Calcutta Telephones. 

 This is part of CalTels plan to provide 6 lakh cellphone connections by 2006. 

 Right now, there are just 200 BTS in the CalTel area, which is inadequate for the large number of subscribers. This has been causing network congestion. 

 Plans are afoot to have 900 such base transmission stations across the city and its suburbs by 2006. 

 These 300 stations will be set up on a war footing while another 600 will be set up later, the official informed.

 CalTel has also decided to clear administrative bottlenecks for gaining of permission to set up the stations. 

 In many municipal areas, getting permission has been a major problem. We are trying to speed up that process, the official said. 

 Excel, the pre-paid service of BSNLs mobile phone services, witnessed a huge growth after it was launched in May last year. Since then, the Excel customer base has gone up to 3.27 lakh.

 An informal survey conducted by BSNL showed that in the last 13 months, growth has been extremely rapid for Excel, leaving the private operators trailing. 

 The subscriber base for Excel went up by more than 1.9 lakh in this period.

 This rapid growth of subscribers forced the authorities to apply several speedbreakers on distribution of cards at intervals.

 Sources said inadequacy of base transmitting stations and a lower radio handling capacity were the main reasons for putting a brakes on the Excel card subscription.

 The BSNL head office has directed CalTel officials to keep a waiting list for Excel cards. A customer has to pay Rs 551 to be on the waiting list. 

 The demand for Excel further went up with the unification of CalTel and the West Bengal Telecom Circle on August 15, 2004. 

 The sizeable customer base of CalTel is actually from the citys neighbouring areas, under the West Bengal Telecom area, causing further network congestion.

 In the WBT area, CellOne was launched more than two years ago and has around 3 lakh subscribers. 

 More than 40,000 WBT subscribers have obtained their SIM cards from CalTel in the past few months, an official said. 

 These customers, coming to the CalTel area during office hours, are creating major network congestion, sources said.

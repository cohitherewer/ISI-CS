 Feud reaches Pranab court 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 12: The Congresss central leadership has asked state party president Pranab Mukherjee to immediately put an end to the row between mayor Subrata Mukherjee and former Bengal Congress chief Somen Mitra over fielding Amiya Mukhopadhyay for the June 19 civic polls, according to sources.

 A bitter battle is raging between the mayor and Mitra over Mukhopadhyay, a sitting councillor and a Subrata loyalist, in ward 48. The former state party president is against Mukhopadhyays candidature, but the mayor insists that he be fielded from his ward.

 Mitra is learnt to have told those close to him that the councillor had won on the hand symbol of the Congress. Then Mukhopadhyay defected to the Trinamul Congress. As Somen Mitra is a Congress MLA from the area under which ward 48 falls, he wants Congress candidates to contest, said a senior party leader.

 This argument does not hold water, as it was decided at meetings with Congress leaders over the past few days that sitting councillors will be allowed to contest from their own wards, said the mayor.

 The situation has come to such a pass that Mitra and Subrata have taken up the matter with Pranab Mukherjee, who has informed the partys central leadership. We hear that Pranabbabu has been asked to sort out the matter immediately with Mitra and Subrata Mukherjee, said a Congress leader.

 We want this controversy to end immediately as this bickering among constituents of the United Democratic Alliance (a newly-floated anti-CPM, anti-BJP platform) is sending the wrong signals to the people, said state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya.

 Pranab Mukherjee, who is also the defence minister, will arrive in Calcutta tomorrow night and meetings to finalise the list of candidates for the Calcutta polls will begin the next day, said Bhattacharya.

 The Congress has agreed to leave 20-25 wards open for the Paschim Banga Unnayan Congress Mancha.

 We will field candidates in 75-76 wards out of 141. We will leave 20-25 wards to the Mancha. The rest of the seats have been set aside for other constituents of the alliance, said a Congress leader.

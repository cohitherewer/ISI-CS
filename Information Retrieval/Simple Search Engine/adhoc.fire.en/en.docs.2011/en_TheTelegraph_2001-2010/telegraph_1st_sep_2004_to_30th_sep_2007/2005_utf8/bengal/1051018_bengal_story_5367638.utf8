 Medics still shy from villages

 - Decades after Left assumed power, rural-urban divide same 

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 Calcutta, Oct. 17: In nearly three decades of its rule, the Left Front government has not been able to make doctors temper their love for the cities and serve rural Bengal instead. 

 Official figures show a shocking sameness in the population-doctors ratio in 1983 and 2003. 

 In 1983, one doctor in rural Bengal was serving a population of 5,386; in urban areas, there was a doctor for every 808 people. Two decades on, 4,734 people in the villages had one doctor to go to, while the cities had a doctor for every 813 people (see chart).

 A senior health department official said the average population of a Bengal village is 1,000. This means on an average, only one doctor is available for about five villages. On the other hand, there might be two to three doctors in a single city neighbourhood as the population density there is high.

 Though the figures include doctors in private set-ups, it is for the government to address the issue seriously, the official said. 

 This is a serious problem that we have attempted to resolve a number of times. From 2001, we are regularly appointing doctors for rural areas. Advertisements have been issued for nearly 2,000 doctors since then. However, many positions are never filled up because doctors dont want to go to villages, director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee told The Telegraph.

 He attributed the doctors tendency to shun villages to a mental block. Young people born and brought up in cities dont want to go to villages. 

 Chatterjee also conceded that the government is still to offer good facilities for doctors in villages and there is still a yawning gap in rural and urban health infrastructure. 

 Now we are focusing on building residential quarters for doctors in rural areas. This is a basic necessity and we hope the jobs will turn out to be more attractive for them, Chatterjee said.

 The Indian Medical Association said it had suggested ways to the government to step up appointment of doctors. 

 R.D. Dubey, the editor of the Journal of Indian Medical Association, said the IMA had made several suggestions to the government to bridge the rural-urban divide. A Medical Service Commission be set on the lines of the school or college service commissions to recruit doctors; and the one-year internship for junior doctors be extended to two years with a year of compulsory service in rural hospitals. 

 Besides, Dubey added, doctors in the health service should be posted in their home district and not transferred unnecessarily. We often find that a doctor from Burdwan has been posted in Jalpaiguri. If that particular doctor is allowed to serve in his home district, we think he would perform better and with enthusiasm.

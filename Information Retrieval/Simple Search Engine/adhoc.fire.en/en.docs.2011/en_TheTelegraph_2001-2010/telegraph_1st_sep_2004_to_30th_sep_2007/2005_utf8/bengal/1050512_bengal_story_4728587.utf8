 Suicide after scolding

 Suri, May 11: A 17-year-old schoolgirl committed suicide this morning after her mother scolded her for not studying, reports our correspondent. 

 Monali Das, a Class IX student of Nalhati Girls High School in Birbhum district, was found hanging from the ceiling fan, with a dupatta tied round her neck, in her house around 8 am. 

 Police said Monali went to bed last night with her sister Sonali. As soon as Sonali woke up and went out of the room, Monali closed the door and hanged herself. 

 Sonali returned to find the door locked from inside. When repeated knocks did not evoke any response, she raised an alarm.

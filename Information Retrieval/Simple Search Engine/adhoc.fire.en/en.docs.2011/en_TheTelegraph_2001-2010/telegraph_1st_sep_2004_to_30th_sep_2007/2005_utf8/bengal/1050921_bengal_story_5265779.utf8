 Somen with Mamata in rally against Salim

 OUR BUREAU

 Somen Mitra and Mamata 

 Banerjee: Hatchet buried?

 Sept. 20: With the Assembly elections only months away, foes are turning friends. 

 Former state Congress chief Somen Mitra, an anathema to Mamata Banerjee not so long ago, today threw his hat in her campaign against the governments decision to hand over farmland in the two 24-Parganas for the Salim Group to set up industry.

 I dont see any wrong in attending Mamatas programme. We should all join forces with her to launch a vigorous protest against the CPMs design to take away farmland from farmers. We should all back Mamata at this juncture rising above petty politics, Mitra said today.

 In a bid to string together a movement against the transfer of land, the Trinamul Congress chief had invited all Opposition leaders and the CPMs partners in the Left Front, who have also been protesting against the decision, to a mass convention on October 2.

 Mitra, however, added that Mamata should write to him and other Congress leaders, inviting them to the meet. 

 The Congress leader fell out with Mamata after she was expelled by the party high command in 1997. 

 Not just Mitra, Congress MLAs Abdul Mannan and Shankar Singh said it would be a blunder if we do not stand by Mamata in her struggle on the Salim issue.

 Mannan added: All Opposition parties should come together to pressure the CPM to shelve the project.

 Observers said the beleaguered Congress is keen to attend Mamatas programme to rejuvenate its own organisation. After a series of reverses in the civic polls, the Congress is looking for avenues to re-energise workers. A joint movement with Mamata will help, said an analyst. 

 Addressing a rally in Nadia today, Mamata displayed a copy of the chief ministers note on the Salim projects that was circulated among the front partners. See their unity. They are so upset at the CPM that they have passed on the copy of the confidential note to me, she said, amid cheers.

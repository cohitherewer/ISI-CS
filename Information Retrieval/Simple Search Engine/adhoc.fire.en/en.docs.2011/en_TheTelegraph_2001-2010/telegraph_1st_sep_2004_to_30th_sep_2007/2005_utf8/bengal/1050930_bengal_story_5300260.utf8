 Stick for mishaps in custody 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Sept. 29: The officers-in-charge of two police stations in Murshidabad have been suspended in the past two days following an inmates attempted suicide in a lock-up and death of another. 

 Superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh issued the suspension notice to the officer-in-charge of Raninagar, Prabir Dutta, on Tuesday. 

 Dutta was charged with dereliction of duty following the attempted suicide of an under-trial who set himself afire inside the lock-up on July 6. 

 Nazrul Sheikh, a resident of Lalgola, about 240 km from Calcutta, had been accused of murdering his wife Chhabi the day before. Dutta at the time was the investigating officer. 

 Nazrul is still battling for life at Lalbag Subdivisional Hospital.

 Sunayan Basu, the officer-in-charge of Jiagunj police station, 225 km from Calcutta, was suspended yesterday. 

 A subdivisional court had asked Basu to inquire into the arrest of one Mozammel Sheikh for a murder that he had apparently not committed.

 Mozammels lawyer had claimed that it was a case of mistaken identity and his client was not the killer. 

 The OC did not conduct the probe and Mozammel died of a heart attack in Behrampore Central Jail. The court had asked Basu to inquire into the matter and submit a report by September 19. But he failed to comply. So, he was suspended, Singh said.

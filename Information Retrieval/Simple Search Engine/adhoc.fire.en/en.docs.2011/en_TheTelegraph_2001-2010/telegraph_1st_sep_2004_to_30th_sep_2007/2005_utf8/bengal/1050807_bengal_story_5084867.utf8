 Schoolboy drowns in Jadavpur jheel

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 6: A Class X student of Patha Bhavan in Ballygunge drowned this afternoon while taking a bath with a group of friends in a pond on the Jadavpur University premises. 

 Abhisek Boses body was fished out almost three hours after he went missing in the water around 4.30 pm. 

 Police sent it to MR Bangur Hospital for a post-mortem late in the evening. 

 A case of unnatural death has been registered with the Jadavpur police station.

 According to the police, Abhisek, who lived in Jamir Lane in Ballygunge, went out with friends this afternoon to play football on the varsity ground. 

 The strapping 17-year-old regularly went to the university for weekend games.

 After the match this afternoon, the police said, Abhisek and his friends went to the waterbody next to the mechanical engineering department building ? commonly known as jheel ? for a wash.

 He apparently went too far into the water. When his friends asked if he was fine, Abhisek waved his hands and said he would manage. But he couldnt cope and finally went down, said Suprabhat Dutta, the additional inspector in charge of the Jadavpur police station. 

 Abhiseks friends tried to rescue him but failed.

 The police sought the services of divers from a voluntary organisation. They pulled the body out. 

 The police informed university officials about the incident but they apparently pleaded helplessness about the problem of outsiders entering the campus for a walk or a game of football.

 Case not heard in 25 years quashed

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 12: Subhas Chandra Das, a suspended employee of a milk plant in Nadia, got justice today, but possibly two decades too late.

 Now 58, Das has already suffered two heart attacks and lost his vision, but the high court returned him the job that he lost 25 years ago.

 He is scheduled to retire in February.

 Krishnagar court, where Dass case was to have been heard for the first time 14 years ago, had not managed to hear it once in all these years. 

 Justice P.N. Sinha of the high court, who quashed the case today, said: The court has sympathetically considered the mental agony, social stigma and physical constraints he had to suffer during the past 25 years for delay on the part of the government and the judiciary. 

 The order followed a peti-tion in the high court by advocate Tapas Ghosh. 

 Das was not in the court today. He is ill.

 A resident of Champaberia in Bongaon, North 24-Parganas, he was a milk tester-cum-milk collector at the government-run Milk Chilling Plant at Bethuadahari, about 140 km from Calcutta.

 On November 14, 1980, the district enforcement branch charged him with purchasing milk without testing it properly. Enforcement officials initiated a case against Das and two others ? Khokan Ghosh and Sudeb Ghosh, both milkmen. 

 After his arrest, Das was suspended from the job. A few months later, the high court granted him bail, but that brought little relief. 

 The trial in the Krishnagar court was to begin in April 1991. Since then, my client has attended the court on 65 occasions. But the trial has not begun, Tapas Ghosh told the high court. Khokan and Sudeb have died. 

 Das will now be entitled to the salary he was deprived of and the retirement benefits.

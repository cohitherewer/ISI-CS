 Doctor fires assault charge at daughter

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, June 15: A 78-year-old doctor from Kalyani today filed an FIR, accusing his daughter and son-in-law of assaulting and humiliating him for property.

 Dr D.K. Saha?s eldest daughter Bandana, a veterinary surgeon, and her husband Prabir Saha, a doctor in Kalyani TB Hospital, allegedly locked him up in the house and thrashed him. They have also been threatening to throw him out of the two-storey house, which the doctor shares with the couple and their 20-year-old son Anirban, Saha said in his complaint.

 On Monday night, the doctor added, a group of people barged into his room and beat him up after ransacking it.

 Saha, a resident of Kalyani in Nadia, 50 km from Calcutta, today approached municipality chairman Santanu Jha for justice. Jha took him to the police station and helped him lodge the complaint.

 ?We have started an investigation. We will provide the senior doctor with all kinds of protection,? said additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh.

 Saha, who has served in various police hospitals across the state, said that every time he went to lodge a complaint, the police would brush him aside. ?The police described my problem as a civil dispute which should be sorted out in court. But how could I convince them about my physical torment? My daughter is out to grab the house and my wife?s jewellery. I have moved court, too, and a case is going on in the Kalyani sub-divisional court.?

 The doctor said the house was built 20 years ago in the name of his wife Bimala, who died of cancer a decade ago. ?I spent my entire life?s savings to educate my four daughters, of whom Bandana is the eldest. My other daughters are married. Now Bandana wants to drive me out of my house.?

 Bandana claimed that her father was not the sole authority of her mother?s property. ?We have equal right to everything in my dead mother?s name. My father just wants to humiliate us with a bunch of false allegations. Just tell me why should we beat him up?? she asked. Prabir was not available for comment.

 Saha said Bandana, Prabir and their son had vacated their quarters on the Kalyani TB Hospital premises about three years ago. 

 ?They told me they were looking for a flat and would shift as soon as possible. But did they not find a house, and it seemed like they did not have any intention of doing so as they wanted to grab this house. For the last one year, I have been subjected to severe harassment and torture by them,? he said.

 The Kalyani municipality chairman called a news conference today and lambasted the police for sitting idle and not coming to the doctor?s rescue. 

 ?I wonder how a senior and respectable citizen like him did not get any help from the police. I demand a thorough inquiry into the matter and want to know why the police did not act earlier,? said Jha, also a district committee member of the CPM.

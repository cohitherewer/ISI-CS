 HC questions doctor death acquittals

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 25: The high court today asked the Nadia court that had acquitted a lady doctor charged with the murder of surgeon Chandan Sen to show cause why its order should not be set aside.

 Arundhati Khanras doctor husband Subharanjan was among those convicted.

 The high court also sought an explanation for the acquittal of Goutam Ganguly, whose father Sunil got a life term, like Subharanjan.

 On July 5, Nadia sessions judge Raghu Bhattacharya also pronounced life terms for Rahamat Alam ? like Subharanjan, Sens colleague at Ranaghat Subdivisional Hospital ? and his driver Abbas Ali Karigar.

 Hearing an appeal by Subharanjan against the trial court order, the division bench of Justices Amit Talukdar and S.P. Mitra expressed surprise regarding the two acquittals. The court granted Subharanjans prayer but issued a rule against the trial judge asking him to show cause on what grounds he acquitted Arundhati and Goutam even after witnesses deposed against them.

 The body of Sen, 52, was found in a pond adjacent to Sunils house on the night of February 26, 2003. He had gone to a dinner hosted by Sunil, a retired head clerk of the hospital. Subharanjan, Arundhati and Alam were among the invitees at the party.

 The doctors had claimed that Sen had drowned, but a post-mortem revealed 11 injuries and that the death was caused by asphyxia as a result of smothering.

 After todays hearing, additional public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami said: It is an unprecedented order. The division bench was going through the trial court verdict while hearing Subharanjan Khanras prayer. According to the witnesses deposition, the judges pointed out, Arundhati and Goutam were also involved in the murder.

 Sekhar Bose, the counsel appearing on behalf of Subharanjan, told the court that there were many loopholes in the trial court judgment. So, the high court should accept the prayer of my client and hear the appeal against the trial courts order.

 A section of lawyers, however, said the court cannot issue such an order until the government files an appeal against the acquittals.

 After a prolonged inquiry, CID officers had revealed that various rackets were operating in the hospital and Sen had protested against them. They also said that Sens anti-nursing home campaign had angered a section of doctors of the hospital, including the Khanras.

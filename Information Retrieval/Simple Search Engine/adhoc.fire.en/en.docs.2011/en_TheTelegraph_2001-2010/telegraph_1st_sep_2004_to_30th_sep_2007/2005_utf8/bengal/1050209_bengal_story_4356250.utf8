 Trident attack on govt

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 8: Three key departments of the Left Front government ? health, education and panchayat ? are likely to face flak from the CPM brass during the party?s 21st state conference, beginning at Kamarhati on the northern fringes of the city tomorrow.

 Party general secretary H.K.S. Surjeet will inaugurate the four-day programme. Veteran leader Jyoti Basu, politburo member Prakash Karat, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas and front chief Biman Bose are among those to be present. 

 A document, titled Left Front Government and Our Job, prepared by commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen will be tabled at the meet on Day II. Over 600 delegates will attend the conference in which the chief minister is expected to present his views on the departments concerned facing criticism. 

 Among other things, the party document mentions the people?s dissatisfaction with healthcare and the functioning of hospitals.

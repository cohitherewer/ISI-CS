 Cops quiz wife, Adhir cries foul 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Sept. 14: Police today questioned Adhir Chowdhurys wife Arpita in connection with two murders in July, raising the Congress MPs hackles.

 Chowdhury, also the Murshidabad district Congress president, took exception to the interrogation at his house and said he has informed state chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb about it.

 The interrogation was in connection with the murder of Hanif Sheikh, 48, and his son Laltoo on the night of July 24. Five persons entered the Nilufa hotel in Behrampore town when it was about to shut shop and shot the owner and his son dead. 

 Eight persons were arrested later. Two of them, Tapas Bose and Gopal Sinha, identified themselves as the MPs friend and driver.

 Four police officers today visited the MPs house to interrogate his wife. Yesterday, we sent a notice to her requesting her to cooperate with the investigating officers. This is part of our probe into the twin murders, superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh said this afternoon. 

 Chowdhury said the interrogation was an attempt to malign him. I have already informed the matter to the state chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb. This is a deliberate attempt to harass my wife and disturb my family life. My wife is a mental patient and the police will be held responsible if anything happens to her.

 He said the police have been unnecessarily harassing Congress workers at the instance of some CPM leaders. If this continues, then I shall begin a vigorous movement, the MP said.

 Arpita said: I am a housewife and have nothing to do with politics. Moreover, when the murders took place, my husband was away in Delhi. Then whats the reason behind interrogating me. Is this not a well-planned conspiracy against us ?

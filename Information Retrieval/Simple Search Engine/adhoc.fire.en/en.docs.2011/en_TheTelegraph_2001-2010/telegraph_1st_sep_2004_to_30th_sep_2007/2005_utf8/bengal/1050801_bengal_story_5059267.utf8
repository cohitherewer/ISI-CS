 Ghisingh soft on Siliguri

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Darjeeling, July 31: Subash Ghisingh has shed his intransigence regarding the inclusion of the entire Siliguri subdivision in the Sixth Schedule provision. 

 Instead, the GNLF leader said he would agree to the territorial demarcation envisaged by the state and Centre. 

 The softening of stand has virtually ended the year-long imbroglio over an alternative to the present council, though space has been left for future bargaining ? something made clear when the Gorkha leader said he was accepting the demarcation under protest. 

 It is understood that Ghisingh will be given some Gorkha-dominated areas of the Siliguri division and both the state and the GNLF chief have prepared their own documents regarding the territory to come under the Sixth Schedule.

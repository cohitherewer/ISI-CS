 Siblings crushed to death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 24: Killer wheels claimed a brother and sister near Moulali crossing this evening. 

 Saddam Hussain, 3, and his sister Saima, 10, were begging on the road when a speeding vehicle mowed them down in front of Entally market.

 Police said they came there following people heading to the nearby church for Midnight Mass with the hope of getting gifts. The vehicle heading towards Mullickbazar hit them from behind, said an officer of the Taltala police station. Their heads were smashed.

 The children, who lived on the pavement in front of St Teresa Church, close to where they were killed, were taken to NRS Medical College Hospital, only to be declared dead. 

 Policemen at Moulali sent a message to units in the following intersections but the vehicle could not be traced, said a traffic department officer.

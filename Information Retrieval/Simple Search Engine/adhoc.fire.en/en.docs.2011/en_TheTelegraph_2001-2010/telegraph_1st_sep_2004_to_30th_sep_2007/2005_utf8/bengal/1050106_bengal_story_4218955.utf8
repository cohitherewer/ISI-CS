 Saha case notice to doctors

 R.VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 5: The Supreme Court today issued notices to three Calcutta doctors and the state of Bengal in the Anuradha Saha case.

 The doctors ? Sukumar Mukherjee, Baidyanath Haldar and Abani Roy Choudhury? had been convicted by the Alipore trial court of medical negligence which led to the death of Anuradha, the wife of US-based doctor Kunal Saha. 

 Calcutta High Court, however, acquitted them in March 2004. 

 Challenging the high court decision, Anuradha?s relative Malay Ganguly filed a special leave petition in the Supreme Court in October 2004, which the court accepted. 

 Today, the apex court bench of Justices B.. Agarwal and P.K. Balasubramaniyan asked the doctors to file replies within eight weeks and posted further hearings after that. 

 The judges also questioned the doctors? counsel on how the judgment of the high court acquitting them ?could be sustained?, when they had sought time to file their affidavits.

 BRIEFS

 Suri, Oct. 28: Mihir Bauri, 35, was crushed to death by a stone slab apparently for protesting against the teasing of a woman in a bazaar near Dubrajpur last night.

 Police said Swarna Bauri, 30, a housewife, was going to a grocery, 270 km from Calcutta, when Gopinath Mondal, who was with friends, made lewd comments. Mihir, her neighbour who was passing by, protested. A heated exchange followed and the issue apparently ended there. But a gang led by Mondal dragged out Mihir from a friends house where he went to watch TV. He is absconding.

 Calcutta: Manmohan Singh will arrive in the city at 7.45 pm on Saturday. On Sunday, he will meet Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, inaugurate an annexe of Ramakrishna Mission Institute of Culture and lay the foundation stone of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research.

 Calcutta: A Salt Lake-bound CSTC bus skidded off EM Bypass near Parama Island and landed in a swamp on Friday night. Six people were injured. Traffic was disrupted.

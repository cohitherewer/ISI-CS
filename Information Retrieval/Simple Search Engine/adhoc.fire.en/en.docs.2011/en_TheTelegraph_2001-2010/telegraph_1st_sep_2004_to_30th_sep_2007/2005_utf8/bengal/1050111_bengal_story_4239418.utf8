 HC seeks report on late-night police raid

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 10: Ashok Gupta was picked up around midnight a year ago, following complaints of torture made by his estranged wife.

 There was no warrant against the Serampore businessman, who was kept in custody for 36 hours without being produced before a magistrate. 

 A division bench of the high court today asked Supratim Sarkar, the Hooghly superintendent of police, ?why?. 

 ?The Hooghly SP will have to clarify why the guidelines of the Supreme Court were not followed during the arrest? and why the police delayed producing him (Gupta) before a judicial magistrate unnecessarily,? said Justices Altamas Kabir and Asit Kumar Bishi.

 The division bench also reminded the advocate-general and the government pleader about the apex court guidelines on late night arrests. The Supreme Court had barred the police from making any late-night arrest minus a proper warrant and said that even if there was one, a family member or relative had to be allowed during interrogation at night.

 The Serampore police, which heard of the complaints against Gupta from their counterparts in Aligarh where his divorced wife was staying, picked up Gupta in a late night raid on January 14.

 The judges today asked the district police chief to attend court personally and submit his report by January 19. They also asked the police to immediately produce Gupta, now in judicial custody, before the Hooghly judicial magistrate.

 A rights organisation had moved court against the police in Gupta?s case.

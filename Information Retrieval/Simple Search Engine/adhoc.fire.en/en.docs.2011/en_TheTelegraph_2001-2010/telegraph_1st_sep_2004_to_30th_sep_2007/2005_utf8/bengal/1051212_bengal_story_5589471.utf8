 AIDS group faces eviction

 OUR BUREAU

 Serampore, Dec. 11: A non-government organisation counselling AIDS patients has lodged a police complaint against a retired army doctor as he refused to let out premises for which he had taken an advance of Rs 9,000.

 Kolkata Network for the Positives had rented a ground-floor room of Bibhuti Bhusan Majumdars three-storied building on Raja Rammohan Roy Road in Serampore, about 20 km from Calcutta.

 The project coordinator of the NGO, Biswajit Das, said they started a clinic in February from the rented room.

 In July, the need for another room arose as the number of patients increased. We requested Majumdars family to let out the adjoining room against which we paid an advance. But in November, they asked us to vacate the ground floor, Das said.

 Majumdars wife Jamuna said: People keep asking why AIDS patients are regularly coming to our house. We want to get rid of the nuisance.

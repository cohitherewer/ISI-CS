 CPM stares at ?crises?

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, March 16: Half-hearted won?t do, the CPM needs committed comrades and fast.

 The party?s recently published organisational and political report, placed before last month?s state conference, says it is growing short of ?wholetimers?.

 A wholetimer is a comrade, man or woman, who works dedicatedly for the party?s growth and is remunerated every month within the range of Rs 1,500 and Rs 4,000. There are perks in the form of medical, travel and tiffin allowance.

 Party leaders say the wholetimers play a critical role in the organisation and produce durable and ?professional revolutionaries?.

 ?At the last state conference held three years ago, the number of wholetimers was 3,350. But now it is 3,219, after the February conference,? the document says.

 In order to stall the slump, the leadership plans to promote as wholetimers those ?young and educated workers? who have served the party for at least 10 years.

 ?The state committee will decide the proposed cadre policy, under which ordinary comrades will be made wholetimers on the basis of their performance. Moreover, the policy envisages how best they could be used for organisational work,? the document says.

 Poor payment is one of the prime reasons for the slump, admits the CPM leadership. It feels that young and educated comrades ? preferably in their twenties and thirties with a flair for organisation ? will want to become wholetimers only if the monthly remuneration is increased.

 ?The paltry amount wholetimers get as monthly remuneration often leads them to immoral activities,? says another document prepared by state CPM secretary Anil Biswas.

 ?Unable to meet financial requirement of their families, wholetimers often get distracted from organisational activities,? it adds.

 The slump, party leaders said, is most pronounced in Jalpaiguri, North Dinajpur, Malda, Murshidabad, Nadia, Hooghly, Bankura and Purulia districts. ?If the trend continues, it will be difficult to carry out party activities,? says the party document.

 It also emphasises the heavy toll that a steady rise in factionalism had taken on the monolithic organisation, especially in Calcutta and North 24-Parganas. The paper also dwells on the state of affairs in Hooghly and West Midnapore, where the party has suffered a vertical split down to the grassroots level.

 Schoolgirl hoodwinks kidnap gang 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Krishnagar, Feb. 10: The spate of abductions continues but a girl from Titagarh has come up trumps against her tormentors. 

 Fourteen-year-old Swapna Bera was returning from school in the industrial township in North 24-Parganas around 4 pm yesterday when a Maruti van pulled up beside her. Police said a middle-aged woman got off and tried to strike up a conversation with the Class VII student of Talpukur Girls? High School. There were three others inside. 

 When Swapna felt uneasy and tried to raise an alarm, the woman held a drug-soaked handkerchief on her nose and she fell unconscious. She was bundled into the car and the gang set off. 

 Swapna doesn?t remember much after that till early this morning when the car halted on a deserted road after travelling 60 km towards Nabadwip. She was returning to her senses and realised that she had been kidnapped. 

 Though groggy from the effects of the drug, she smartly lay still on the back seat and watched the women disappear behind some bushes, possibly to answer nature call. The driver also stepped out and began smoking. 

 ?I was groggy and had a splitting headache. But this was my chance to escape. I quietly slid open the door opening on the side of the road and tiptoed out of the car. I just ran in the opposite direction,? said Swapna. 

 She ran aimlessly for about an hour-and-a-half and reached the banks of the Ganga near Nabadwip town around 8.30 this morning. 

 Scared and gasping for breath, Swapna stood there and broke into tears. Soon curious villagers gathered around her, but she was not able to give any coherent reply. At this time, Pankaj Singh, a trader of Nabadwip, was passing by and spotted Swapna. 

 Noticing her plight, he took her home and his family comforted her. After sometime, Swapna was able to narrate the events from last afternoon. 

 ?She was still in a state of shock and was shivering. Moreover, the effect of drug was still on her,? said Singh, who informed Nabadwip police. Around 11 am, a police team arrived and recorded Swapna?s statement. 

 By the time they returned, an alert had reached from Titagarh that Swapna was missing. 

 ?We have got the description of the women from Swapna and have alerted the neighbouring police stations,? said additional police superintendent Biswarup Ghosh. 

 This afternoon, Swapna?s father Biswanath, an employee of Titagarh Steel, arrived at Nabadwip police station and locked her daughter in a tight embrace, tears of joy rolling down his cheeks.

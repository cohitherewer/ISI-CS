 CM for Delhi talks on hills

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Darjeeling, Feb. 11: The Centre has convened a tripartite meeting on February 17 in an attempt to break the deadlock over the elections to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC). Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will attend the meeting.

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said Union home minister Shivraj Patil called up Bhattacharjee around noon to inform him about the date for the talks to be held in Delhi. ?The chief minister has agreed to attend the meeting and the information has been conveyed to DGHC chairman Subash Ghisingh. We expect that the impasse over holding the elections will end after the meeting,? he said.

 Deepak Gurung, the Darjeeling branch committee president of the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF), said Ghisingh would ?carry forward? the issues he had raised regarding an ?alternative to the council? at the meeting. ?We are expecting a positive result this time as the meeting will be political..,? Gurung said. Ghisingh, he added, would ?certainly? be present at the meeting.

 The People?s Democratic Front (PDF), an umbrella organisation of Opposition parties in the hills, said it would write to both Patil and Bhattacharjee asking them not to attend. ?Ghisingh does not have the mandate of the people to take part in the talks as the council is running on borrowed time and its term expires on March 26,? PDF chairman Madan Tamang said.

 Though the DGHC?s term ends on March 25 and a new board will have to be constituted, Ghisingh has refused to participate in the elections until his demands are met through a tripartite meeting.

 The earlier tripartite meeting, held on January 28, was attended by Ghisingh, the Union and state home secretaries and the Bengal chief secretary. The GNLF chief was assured that his demands would be looked into, but he did not change his stand on the polls.

 Last Tuesday, Bhattacharjee held a one-to-one with Ghisingh at Writers? Buildings and tried to convince him about the importance of the elections. But the GNLF leader made it clear he would not agree on the polls till all his demands were met and sought further tripartite meetings.

 Some of his demands include more central funds, power to recruit teachers and control over police deployment in the Darjeeling hills.

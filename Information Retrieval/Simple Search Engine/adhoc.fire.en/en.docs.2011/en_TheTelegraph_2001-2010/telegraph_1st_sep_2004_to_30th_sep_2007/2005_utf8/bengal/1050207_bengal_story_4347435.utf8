 Huddle in hotel leads to civic dismissal 

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Feb. 6: A ?secret? meeting with dissident Trinamul Congress councillors at a city hotel on Wednesday ? allegedly to engineer a party split ? led to the expulsion of mayor-in-council Pradip Ghosh from the city civic board.

 Party sources said a group of Trinamul councillors, led by Ghosh and Iqbal Ahmed, decided to pressure Mamata Banerjee to sever relations with the BJP and forge an electoral alliance with the Congress at the closed-door meeting. They even decided that 20 party councillors would serve a 48-hour ultimatum to Mamata, saying they would switch to the Congress if she refused.

 When the news about the meeting reached mayor Subrata Mukherjee on Friday, he prevailed on Mamata to expel Ghosh from the party. 

 ?The party does not approve of the meeting. We are left with no option?,? Mamata is learnt to have told associates before sacking Ghosh.

 Amiya Mukherjee, the Trinamul councillor from ward 48, was today sworn in mayor-in-council in charge of health at the Calcutta Municipal Corporation headquarters.

 Ghosh today made an attempt to rope in some ?disgruntled? Trinamul and Congress councillors to topple the civic board, but to no avail. ?I called former state Congress chief Somen Mitra to discuss the fallout of my expulsion. I am a Congress product and will rejoin the party,? he said.

 Congress leaders, however, said they would not do anything that may help the CPM wrest the board. ?Ghosh is welcome back, but we are against toppling the civic board,? said a key Congress functionary.

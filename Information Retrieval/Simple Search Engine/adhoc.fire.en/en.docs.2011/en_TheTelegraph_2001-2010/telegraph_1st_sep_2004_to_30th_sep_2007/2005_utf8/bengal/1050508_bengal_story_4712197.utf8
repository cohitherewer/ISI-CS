 Infant killed over affair

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Barrackpore, May 7: A 30-year-old man, suspecting his wife of having an extra-marital affair, attacked her and then drowned his eight-month-old son in a bucket.

 Ratan Baspar ? a railway employee ? is absconding.

 Last midnight, Ratan returned drunk to his house near Kanchrapara railway shed, about 35 km from Calcutta. ?He started beating up his wife, who asked him to stay away,? said Praveen Kumar, the police superintendent of North 24-Parganas.

 Ratan accused Anita of having an extra-marital affair and alleged that the infant was not his son. ?Ratan then attacked his wife with a kitchen knife,? said an official of Bijpur police station. He then took the child outside and drowned him in a bucket.

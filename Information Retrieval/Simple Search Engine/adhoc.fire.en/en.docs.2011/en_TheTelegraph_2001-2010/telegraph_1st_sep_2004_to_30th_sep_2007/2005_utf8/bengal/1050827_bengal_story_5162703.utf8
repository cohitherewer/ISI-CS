 Basu with successor

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Aug. 26: Jyoti Basu today threw his weight behind Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on the Salim Groups acquisition of land in South 24-Parganas for a special economic zone, saying that the interest of poor farmers would be protected anyhow.

 I have come to know from newspapers that Buddha has signed a MoU with the Salim Group during his trip to Southeast Asia. Although I am not aware of its details, I am sure that the project would come up on land belonging to big farmers. Our government will protect the interest of poor and marginal farmers, Basu said this afternoon. 

 The veteran CPM leader said that he discussed the proposed conversion of farmland with land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla last night. I assured him that poor farmers would not be affected. However, as he has some genuine concerns regarding the conversion of land, a further discussion is necessary. Let Buddha come back tonight... he added.

 The former chief minister said the issue would also figure in talks in the partys central committee and politburo next month. The decision on conversion of agricultural land for setting up industrial units will be taken on the basis of consensus.

 Molla today appeared mellowed and hinted that though he did not agree with the chief ministers land acquisition policy, he would not oppose him in public. Reminded about Bhattacharjees claim in Jakarta that the conversion issue had been settled, Molla said: I dont believe what the media is saying.

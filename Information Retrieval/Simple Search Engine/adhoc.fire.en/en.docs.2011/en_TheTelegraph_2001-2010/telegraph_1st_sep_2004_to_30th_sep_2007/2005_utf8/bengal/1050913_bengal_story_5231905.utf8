 Bangla in rebel flushout

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Manikgunj (Jalpaiguri), Sept. 12: After repeated requests from the Indian side, the Bangladesh defence authorities have finally agreed to wipe out camps of Indian insurgent groups in certain areas of their country. 

 R.S. Mooshahary, the Border Security Force (BSF) director-general who visited the border areas here today, confirmed the operation. 

 The Bangladesh defence forces have started their drive against Indian militant outfits based on their side. They have stepped up action in pockets off Meghalaya and Tripura in the past two months, Mooshahary told reporters at the Manikgunj border outpost, about 35 km from Jalpaiguri.

 The BSF director-general arrived here in the afternoon with other senior officers and met local police officers, public representatives and members of the Berubari Pratiraksha Committee, a forum spearheading the movement to save Indian enclaves in Bangladesh. 

 According to Mooshahary, the list of 190 militant camps that was handed over to the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) at a recent meeting in Siliguri will help the authorities hunt the groups out. The list had concrete information about militant groups having their bases in Bangladesh, he said.

 Residents of Berubari have refused to allow the Central Public Works Department to erect a border fence in the area. They have argued that five enclaves would be completely cut off from the mainland if the fence is allowed to come up.

 Talking about the wrong international border, the DG said: The problem can only be solved at the highest level.

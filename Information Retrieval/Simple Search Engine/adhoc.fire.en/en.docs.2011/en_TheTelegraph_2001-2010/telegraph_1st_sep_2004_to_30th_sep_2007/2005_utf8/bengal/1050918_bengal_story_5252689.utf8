 Hospitals dirty: Buddha

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 17: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today admitted that the condition in government-run hospitals is appalling and invited private entrepreneurs to extend healthcare facilities.

 Those who have money can go to privately-run specialised hospitals for treatment. I am aware that our state-run hospitals are dirty, where staff members are reluctant to perform duty, Bhattacharjee said today while inaugurating a joint venture health centre constructed by the Ashokenagar-Kalyangar municipality and West Bank hospital.

 CPI(ML) activists demonstrated in front of the hospital in the morning. There is a government hospital within a kilometre of this new one that needs a facelift. This could have been done with one-tenth of the money that has been spent for the new hospital, said the district unit secretary of the party, Partha Ghosh.

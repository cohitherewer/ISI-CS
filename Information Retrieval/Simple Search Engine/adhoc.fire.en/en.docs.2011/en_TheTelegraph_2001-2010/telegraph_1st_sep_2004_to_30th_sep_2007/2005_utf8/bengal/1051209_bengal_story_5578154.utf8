 Adhir in pain, trial put off

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Behrampore, Dec. 8: Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury, accused in a double murder case, was not produced at the chief judicial magistrates court today after he complained of pain in the spinal cord.

 Police had made elaborate security arrangements fearing trouble from Congress supporters. The superintendent of Behrampore Central Jail informed the magistrate that Chowdhury had to be taken to the prison hospital and doctors have advised him bed rest.

 The magistrate has ordered the next hearing on Wednesday.

 The MPs wife Arpita and another co-accused, Tapan Bose, were produced before the magistrate today.

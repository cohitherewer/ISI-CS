 Civic body in tax row

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, June 25: Asok Bhattacharya, the state urban development minister and chairman of the Siliguri Jalpaiguri Development Authority, today came down heavily on the central income tax department for attaching the accounts of the body over non-payment of dues.

 Bhattacharya claimed development authorities are not liable to pay tax and said he would write to Union finance minister P. Chidambaram and chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee demanding an inquiry into the extreme step taken by the income tax department.

 On June 22, we received a letter from the bank with which we have an account that it was attached by the IT department on June 15, said the urban development minister. 

 Four bank accounts of the Siliguri Regulated Market were also seized by the IT department for defaulting income tax of about Rs 1 crore.

 Nowhere in India has a statutory body like a development authority been taxed this way before. Development authorities work for the uplift of the people and are not an office of profit. If a development authority has to pay tax, all other government bodies, like municipalities and panchayats, will also have to, Bhattacharya said.

 The minister termed the move politically motivated. It is an insult to the state government, he said.

 Our is a non-profit development-oriented government agency. They had sent notificat ions to us in March and we had appealed against it. Despite that, they went ahead and attached our account, said the minister.

 They should have had informed us before attaching the account. It was not the IT department, but the bank that informed us about the development ? after a good seven days, he said.

 The urban development minister said the matter would also be taken up by the Association of Management of Development Authorities.

 IT officials, however, said the move was in accordance with the Income Tax Act.

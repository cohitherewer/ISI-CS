 Left bid to avoid seat soup

 Calcutta, March 16: Wiser after its poor showing in the civic polls of 2000, the Left Front has lined up an effort to iron out differences among partners over candidate selection.

 ?We would be able to finalise our candidates for the 82 civic bodies by March 31,? Left Front chairman Biman Bose told reporters at the CPM headquarters this afternoon. 

 There would be two rounds of meetings before the list is finalised ? on March 24 and 31.

 Asked if the CPM was fearing a repeat of July 2000, when several front candidates contested against each other, Bose evaded a straight answer. ?We will be able to sort out problems regarding seat-sharing for the ensuing elections at the two meetings,? he said. 

 In case of disputes at the lower levels, the district front committees would try to sort them out. If they fail, the front brass would intervene, he added. Key leaders of several front constituents have been asked to prepare a preliminary list of candidates by March 25. 

 In 2000, the front captured only 64 civic bodies out of 121, primarily because of infighting in Calcutta, North 24-Parganas, Howrah and pockets of north Bengal. The Congress had bagged 34 municipalities, the Trinamul Congress-BJP 19 and the GNLF four. Together, the Opposition parties bagged 57 civic bodies, just seven less than the front.

 Observers said the CPM leadership is worried as another round of setbacks is bound to cast its shadow on the Assembly elections, slated for 2006. A senior party leader admitted as much: ?Our performance this May might be treated as an acid test for next year.?

 Cong arrest

 The CID today arrested Sasanka Biswas, the Hanskhali panchayat samiti chief and a former Congress MLA, in connection with the murder of a CPM supporter. Swapan Biswas was killed at Nadia?s Hanskhali, 70 km from Calcutta, in January.

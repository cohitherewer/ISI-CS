 Another village vanishes in water

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Panchanandapur (Malda), Aug. 10: This time, it was Vastparas turn. 

 With it, the number of villages devoured by the Ganga in this erosion-prone area in the past two years has reached 35. 

 It took three hours for the hamlet in Panchanandapur, 25 km from Malda town, to disappear into the swirling waters, leaving around a hundred families homeless. Huge chunks of earth broke away from the banks as residents watched in horrified silence.

 The river, which last month had eaten into the marketplace here, is now only 150 m from the bus stand. Irrigation engineers are worried as the Ganga is now flowing very close to the embankment of the Pagla, which if breached might lead to widespread inundation.

 Since this noon, residents of Vastpara had started moving out of their huts, carrying their belongings. They spent the day on the top of the embankment.

 Maya Mondol, one of the displaced villagers, said: Suddenly, there was a whoosh, and we came out to see large chunks of the bank disappearing into the river. At first we did not know what to do. As the river started swallowing up more, we quickly assembled together whatever we could lay our hands on ? clothes, utensils and so on ? and made our way to the top of the embankment under the open sky. We did not have any food the whole day.

 When news of the erosion reached the district headquarters, sabhadhipati of the zilla parishad Gautam Chakrabarty and engineers of the irrigation department rushed to the spot. Chakrabarty had to face a crowd of angry villagers who demanded an alternative arrangement for shelter.

 Even after spending Rs 24 crore, we could not stop the erosion. What can I do? It seems to be an impossible task, the sabhadhipati said, adding that he would return to Malda and arrange for relief.

 Villagers alleged that every time a settlement goes under water, promises are made, but seldom are they kept. We have seen that of the over 25,000 people rendered homeless because of the floods, only a thousand have settled down on land provided by the district administration, a villager told Chakrabarty.

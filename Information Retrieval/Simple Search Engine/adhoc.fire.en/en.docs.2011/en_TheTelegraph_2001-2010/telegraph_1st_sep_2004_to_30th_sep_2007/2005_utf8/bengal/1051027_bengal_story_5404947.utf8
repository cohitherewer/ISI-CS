 VIP and fugitive? Try this oasis

 - Allies wake up, Not big brother

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Biswas

 Calcutta, Oct. 26: Even 

 in the so-called lawless state of Bihar a Union 

 minister sought anticipatory bail today after a non-bailable 

 arrest warrant was issued against him, but in oasis 

 of peace Bengal, a state minister continues to be 

 a fugitive from justice, though his whereabouts are known.

 Narayan Biswas, of the CPM, also continues to be a member of the cabinet of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who does not tire of calling Bengal ? and Calcutta ? an oasis of peace.

 For 16 years, Biswas has been allowed to run free and even rewarded with a ministry, though his anticipatory bail plea was rejected. He has been accused of torching the houses of Congress supporters.

 In Bihar today, Union minister of state for water resources Jaiprakash Narayan Yadav, against whom a non-bailable warrant was issued, moved court seeking anticipatory bail in a poll-related case.

 A part of what the law has been able to achieve for years ? the warrant against Biswas was issued in June 1989 ? the CPMs partners are now attempting to do: get him to at least resign.

 There is no denying that Narayan Biswas is a fugitive from justice, said Manju Kumar Majumdar, secretary of the state CPI. One has to admit that a non-bailable arrest order has been pending against him for a long time and the administration has not done anything to implement the order.

 Several senior leaders of the Forward Bloc said the CPM leaderships silence on the Biswas issue was surprising. They cited the example of the Bloc, which removed one of its leaders and former agricultural marketing minister, Chhaya Ghosh, following corruption charges.

 We did not wait for any court intervention and removed her, a Bloc leader said. The CPM could have done it 16 years ago.

 Most Left Front partners felt that Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress would exploit the Biswas scandal in the 2006 Assembly election. The government will find it hard to explain why police failed to arrest a fugitive minister, said a CPI leader.

 Mamata today asked Trinamul to mount a campaign targeting the chief minister because of the protection Biswas receives from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and the CPM.

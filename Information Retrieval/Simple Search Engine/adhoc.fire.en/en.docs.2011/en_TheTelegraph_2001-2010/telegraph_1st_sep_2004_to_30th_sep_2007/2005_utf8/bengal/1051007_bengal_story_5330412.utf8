 Made to toil alone, doctor walks out

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, Oct. 6: Over the past seven days, S. Dhar, a doctor at a health centre in North 24-Parganas, had been attending to the stream of patients alone. The centre has two other doctors, but one is on leave while the other has reported sick.

 Yesterday afternoon, Dhar locked up the health centre, nailed a letter of apology on its door and submitted the keys to the officer-in-charge of Deganga police station.

 Dr Dhar stormed into the OCs chamber and threw the keys on his table. I cant take the pressure any more. Here are the keys. Please make arrangements to run the health centre, the doctor told the OC before leaving, said district magistrate, Manoj Pant.

 The authorities have appointed two doctors at the health centre in Biswanathpur block on a temporary basis, he added.

 I have heard about the incident. I have sought a report from the district chief medical officer of health. Action will be taken against the doctor, said director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee.

 The district magistrate said the doctors behaviour was surprising. At that time, there were patients in the hospital and nurses were in a quandary as the doctor walked out. We came to know about this last evening and made arrangements for replacements. We have initiated an inquiry, Pant said.

 District health authorities said three doctors were posted at the 10-bed health centre, which also has a labour ward, besides outdoor clinics. 

 For the past one week, Dr Dhar had been single-handedly running the health centre as two others were absent. One had gone on leave while the other had reported sick. Dr Dhar was being forced to see over 150 patients a day, said a health official.

 Officials said that apart from the pressure at the health centre, the doctor also had to attend to emergency calls in other adjacent health centres.

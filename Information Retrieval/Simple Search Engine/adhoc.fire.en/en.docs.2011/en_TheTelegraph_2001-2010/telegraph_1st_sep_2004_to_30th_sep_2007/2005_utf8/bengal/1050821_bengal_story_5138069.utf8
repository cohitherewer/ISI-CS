 Dengue alert after child deaths

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 20: Six dead and a hundred hit.

 With dengue striking terror across the city ? four of its six victims in the last 48 hours are children ? the health department has launched a drive to identify the pockets that have been hit the hardest and draw up a plan for its cure.

 Two separate teams under senior officers along with virologists from the School of Tropical Medicine are on the city streets and will submit a report to us. They will focus on the areas where dengue has struck and the breeding ground of the Aedes mosquitoes (which cause the fever) and destroy them, said Prabhakar Chatterjee, the director of health services.

 The Aedes mosquitoes are larger and darker than the usual ones and the fever is accompanied by acute pain in the joints and muscles, nausea and bleeding from gums, nose and other parts of the body.

 The unexplained part is that these mosquitoes attack only in the mornings or early hours, when a person is sleeping. The bleeding is unstoppable and the damage to the body is at times life-threatening, said Jayati Sengupta, paediatrician and co-ordinator at AMRI Hospitals.

 Last evening, nine-year-old Saheli Kar from Lake Gardens succumbed to Dengue Shock Syndrome after a two-day battle for life. When she came to us, she was bleeding all over the body and was in great discomfort. We tried to save her, but could not, said Sengupta. 

 Two other girls ? Deepika Pandey, 11, and Sujata Ghosh, 10 ? are also suffering from dengue symptoms. Deepika is in a state of shock. We are asking parents to be extremely careful about any fever, which is alarmingly high. The best thing to do is rush to hospitals without delay, said Sengupta.

 Apart from Lake Gardens, dengue has been reported from several areas, including Dhakuria, where Arif Gazi, 8, and Firoza Bibi, 25, died yesterday morning. Residents around Prince Anwar Shah Road and Deshapran Sashmal Road have also been alerted following the death of two children in the last 30 hours.

 A large number of people are suffering from the fever. We are trying to take all precautions, said Ratan Dey, the local Trinamul councillor.

 Health department officials said the teams doing the rounds of the city have been asked to remove stagnant water in the areas where dengue has struck this year. 

 On reaching the focal point (the most affected area), they will spray insecticides and take every possible precaution, Jayshree Mitra, the director of medical education, said.

 We are taking all-out efforts to stop this viral haemorrhagic fever from spreading in the city, she added.

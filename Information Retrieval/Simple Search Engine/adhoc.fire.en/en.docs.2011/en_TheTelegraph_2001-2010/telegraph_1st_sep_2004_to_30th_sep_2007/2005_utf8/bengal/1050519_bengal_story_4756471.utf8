 Pranab lines up probe

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 18: As Pranab Mukherjee gears up to begin a probe into Sundays assault, state Congress circles are abuzz with talk that followers of either Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi or Somen Mitra are responsible for the incident.

 The defence minister, also the state Congress president, will arrive tomorrow to kick off his partys campaign for the May 22 municipality elections in Murshidabad.

 Mukherjee took the onus of the investigation on himself, apparently because he did not want the Das Munshi faction to gain the whip hand and turn the situation against Mitra. 

 Mitra is Mukherjees alleged ally in a pact with mayor Subrata Mukherjee, who recently broke away from the Trinamul Congress to float the Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha.

 On Sunday, Mukherjee was roughed up by a group of Congress workers from the Entally-Taltala area, who were protesting against the partys decision to allot ward No. 55 to a candidate from the Mancha. The supporters of former councillor Arun Das were demanding that the seat be allotted to his wife Sabita. Das was subsequently suspended for having triggered the attack. 

 Das said he wants to meet Mukherjee to tell him about the involvement of Das Munshi loyalists. Pranabda should know that those who had actually attacked him were all Youth Congress supporters, who are close to Das Munshi.

 He claimed that workers owing allegiance to Das Munshi had come to the state Congress office around the same time that some of his men were protesting against the allotment of ward 55. 

 Das Munshis men reached there to protest against the denial of ticket to Mohammed Zafar, who is close to the Union minister, for ward 59. They mingled with our men and assaulted Pranabda, Das alleged, adding that a probe will expose the real culprits.

 Youth Congress president Amitava Chakraborty rubbished Dass charge.

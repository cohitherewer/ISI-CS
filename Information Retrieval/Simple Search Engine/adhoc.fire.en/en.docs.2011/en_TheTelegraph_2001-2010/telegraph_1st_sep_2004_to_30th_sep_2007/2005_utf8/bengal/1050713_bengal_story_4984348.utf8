 Police offer cover, party acts coy

 July 12: Certain that CPM supporters are prime targets, police in Bankura have decided to provide security to 17 party leaders identified as the rebels potential prey.

 But the party is not sure if it wants protection. A police shield may, after all, be interpreted as a sign of weakness.

 The leaders perceived to be under threat belong to the Khatra subdivision, under which falls Barikul where two CPM supporters were gunned down on Saturday.

 Bankura district magistrate Pravat Mishra and superintendent of police K. Jayaraman discussed the threat perception with senior CPM leaders, including district secretary Amiya Patra, at Khatra last night. Sources said the 17 leaders shortlisted figure in the Maoists hit list.

 We are worried about the security of some of the leaders and we want to provide guards to them, Jayaraman said. CPM leaders have also been asked not to venture outdoors after sundown.

 But the party believes that a security cover would alienate its grassroots leaders from people. The people are our source of strength. They will provide us the necessary security. We never sought police protection, Patra said. But if the police feel that some of us need guards, let them do what is necessary, he added. 

 The hesitation in the party over accepting bodyguards for leaders became all the more apparent when the district leader insisted that no decision had yet been taken.

 As a former MLA, Patra, however, has a revolver-toting constable shadowing him.

 How can we move around freely with the guards in tow? asked another CPM leader. A bodyguard could also mean an extra mouth to feed for those being shielded, he added.

 Police sources said the list of 17 comprises leaders from Barikul, Ranibandh, Sarenga and Raipur. Mohan Hembram, the Barikul local committee secretary, district committee member Nakul Mahato, Subhash Murmu, a Ranibandh zonal committee member, and Patra feature on it. 

 After senior leader Rampada Majhi was killed in Ranibandh in 2002, the police provided security to 11 party leaders. The cover was withdrawn following reassessment of threat in some cases and the leaders reluctance in others.

 Raghunath Murmu, a Ranibandh zonal member had refused police protection all along. Last Saturday, he was gunned down with another party leader, Badal Mudi, at Majhgeria in Barikul.

 Krishnagar, Nov. 8: Concerned over the sorry state of primary education in Nadia, the chief minister has instructed the administration to get cracking before it snowballs further. 

 At a meeting with the district administration, primary education authorities and the zilla parishad chief on Sunday, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee asked those present to take stern action against teachers who neglected their duties.

 At a news conference in Calcutta yesterday, the chief minister had said that quality of teaching in primary schools urgently needed to be improved.

 District magistrate Rajesh Pandey said the chief minister also discussed the teacher-student ratio of 1:70 in the 3,000-odd primary schools in Nadia. The state average is one teacher for every 55 students. The chief minister asked us to recruit teachers wherever required to ensure a better teacher-student ratio. We will soon make a survey to assess the requirements. Initially, we will recruit para-teachers (on contract), Pandey added. About 4,000 of them will be appointed in a year, making the number of such teachers in the district 8,000.

 A study by former headmasters and teachers had found 20 per cent of the primary teachers in Nadia unfit for their job and about 30 per cent of students near-illiterate. How can the teaching be so poor? Why are they teaching wrong things despite getting decent salaries? the chief minister asked at the meeting.

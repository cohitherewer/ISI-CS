 Low-key protest in House

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 10: Opposition Trinamul Congress, in sharp contrast to last year, today restrained itself during the opening day of the budget session by merely shouting slogans and displaying placards when governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi was addressing the House.

 During last year?s budget session, Trinamul Congress MLAs had snatched then governor Viren J. Shah?s written speech from him and even tried to prevent him from reading it out.

 This year mayor Subrata Mukherjee led Trinamul?s unusual admiration of the governor. ?In terms of individual presentation and role, Gandhi fulfils Bengal?s requirements,? Mukherjee said.

 Trinamul Congress MLAs today displayed placards and shouted slogans against the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government, but did not try to prevent Gandhi from delivering his speech. However, two SUCI legislators walked out.

 Some MLAs such as Sonali Guha, Subrata Bakshi, Paresh Pal and Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay were heard shouting ?Go back governor? and seen displaying placards that read ?We want food and not starvation deaths?.

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, it is learnt, will place the budget on March 21. However, Opposition leader Pankaj Banerjee pointed out that the budget will be placed just ten days before the session ends on March 31. ?We are given only ten days to discuss the budget. This is absolutely unfair,? he said.

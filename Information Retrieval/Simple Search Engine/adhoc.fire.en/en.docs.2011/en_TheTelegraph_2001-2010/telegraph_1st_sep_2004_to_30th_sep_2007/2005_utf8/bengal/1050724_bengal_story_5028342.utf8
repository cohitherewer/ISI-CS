 Eviction unrest

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, July 23: Around 150 to 200 slum-dwellers of Bondel Gate today took to the streets to protest against the governments decision to launch an eviction drive to make way for a flyover. 

 The demonstrators set up a roadblock at the intersection of Bondel Gate Road and Rifle Range Road for over four hours from 9 am, forcing senior officers from the two police stations to rush to the spot.

 They said a police team went around the area last night, asking the settlers and owners of kiosks to move out within 24 hours.

 The agitation ended only after local MLA Rabin Deb promised to look into their demands. However, the crowd has threatened a rerun on Sunday if the police go ahead with the eviction plan.

 The protesters wanted an assurance from none other than the local MLA himself and stuck to their decision till then. This made matters difficult for us. Finally, it was withdrawn around 1.15 pm, said a police officer.

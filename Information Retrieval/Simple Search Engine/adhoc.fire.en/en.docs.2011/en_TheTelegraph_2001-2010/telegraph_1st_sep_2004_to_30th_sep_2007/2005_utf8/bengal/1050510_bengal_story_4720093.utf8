 Sermon to teachers at Tiyasa school

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Chandernagore, May 9: Schoolteachers have to be ?extra cautious? with students, increase attention towards individuals and try to monitor their behaviour constantly.

 These were some of the suggestions made at the first meeting of a committee set up by the Association of Teachers of Anglo-Indian Schools in the wake of Tiyasa Biswass suicide in St Josephs Convent, Chandernagore.

 The meeting today was held at Tiyasas school. The Class IX student had hanged herself in a classroom on April 6 when her friends assembled for morning prayers.

 ?Teachers need to be more loving and caring and should bring to notice any behaviour in students they deem not normal,? said Ismail Nehal, a teacher at St James School in Calcutta who is also the association president and part of the three-member committee. 

 ?Students are now under various kinds of pressure at home. It could be from syllabus or expectations from parents to score high marks in examinations and even family problems. Teachers can help them in many ways to reduce this stress,? Nehal said.

 Tiyasas parents had accused the class teacher of putting her under pressure for not taking tuition from her. 

 After discussions with students, teachers, guardians and the management of St Josephs Convent on problems faced by students, he added: ?Apart from monitoring students performance, we need to be alert to their behaviour as well.?

 The committee said Tiyasa was reportedly suffering from depression for some time before she committed suicide. ?There must have been some changes in her behaviour. She may not have taken the drastic decision had someone noticed her behavioural changes,? said a panel member.

 The teachers were advised to immediately report to parents and the school authorities any abnormal behaviour in a student. 

 ?We understand it is difficult for teachers to monitor an individual students psychological patterns. But as students spend a considerable time in school, we cannot ignore this responsibility,? said one of the committee members.

 Speeding VIP car spills blood

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 23: An employee of Rajabazar Science College was hit and injured this afternoon by a car belonging to the higher education minister.

 Ajit Das, aged about 45, an employee of the students? cell of the computer science department, had stepped out of a building on the campus when he was hit by the car that was on its way to pick up Satyasadhan Chakraborty.

 Das fell to the ground and hurt his head and face, the blood staining his clothes.

 ?I was attending a seminar on the Rajabazar campus. My driver, Tapan, was on his way to pick me up. On the way, an employee of the college suddenly emerged from one of the buildings and was grazed by one of the wings of the car. I think he had not seen the vehicle coming,? the minister said.

 Chakraborty had arrived around 11.30 am in the white Ambassador. The car returned around noon to pick the minister up. Witnesses said it was speeding. They also said a crowd confronted driver Tapan, who claimed that the accident was Das?s fault.

 The situation was spiralling out of control when Manab Kumar Sengupta, the college science secretary, stepped in. Moments later, Chakraborty arrived, apologised for the driver?s mistake and left. ?I was not in the car but was informed about the incident. The matter was amicably settled. So I don?t understand why it should be made an issue,? the minister said. 

 Das was taken to hospital and later returned to work on the campus.

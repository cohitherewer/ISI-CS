 Oil firms reject plea on auto LPG outlets

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

Calcutta, May 21: Oil companies have virtually 

turned down the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments request to set up more 

LPG outlets in the city, saying the number of vehicles running on that fuel at 

present does not merit it.

 Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty had at a meeting in Writers Buildings on Thursday with senior officers of oil companies urged the firms to set up more LPG outlets to ensure a steady supply of the auto fuel.

 We have already set up seven LPG outlets in the city. Another two will be put into operation in a couple of days. We feel these are more than enough to feed the current fleet of LPG-run vehicles, asserted A.C. De, the deputy general manager (LPG) of Indian Oil Corporation.

 The seven outlets have the capacity of supplying 630 metric tonnes of gas per month, but the monthly sales have never gone beyond 60 metric tonnes. There is, therefore, no need to open any new outlet, said De.

 The IOC official said setting up an LPG outlet costs Rs 50-75 lakh and the oil companies have to invest the entire amount. We have done it to popularise the green fuel and reduce auto emission. But we are not getting much business here, he said.

 We had earlier planned to set up 16 LPG outlets in the city and started work accordingly. But after the installation of a few pumps we found there are only a handful of takers and decided to go slow. There is no point in opening more outlets unless there is a simultaneous rise in the number of LPG-run vehicles, De said.

 Hindustan Petroleums Manager (Operations), Kalyan Roy, said the companys investment in the existing LPG outlets has virtually yielded no return.

 Why should we invest more if we do not get business? Let there first be a positive move to increase the number of LPG-run vehicles. Once this is assured, neither the government nor the consumers need to worry about the availability of the green fuel. It is our duty to ensure adequate supply of the gas, Roy said.

 IOC has also laid down terms and conditions in response to the transport ministers request to set up LPG outlets in Calcutta State Transport Corporation depots, include the government sharing 50 per cent of the total investment and taking full responsibility for the operation and maintenance of the outlets.

 The transport department has decided to set up LPG pumps at Maniktala, Salt Lake, Taratala, Kasba, Thakurpukur and Barasat.

 Apart from providing 50 per cent of funds and bearing the cost of maintenance, we have urged CSTC officials to get the required no-objection from the statutory authorities, a clearance from the explosives department, permission from the local administration and also ensure basic amenities in the complex, said an IOC official.

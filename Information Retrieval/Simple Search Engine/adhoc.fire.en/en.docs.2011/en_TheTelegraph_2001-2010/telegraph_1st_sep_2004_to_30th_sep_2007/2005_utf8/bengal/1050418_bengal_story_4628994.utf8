 Headmaster beaten up in poll fracas

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, April 17: A secondary school headmaster, who was presiding over its managing committee?s election, was beaten up this morning by guardians who accused him of helping CPM-backed candidates. 

 When police reached Borochandghar Primary School at Kalgunj and tried to rescue headmaster Asit Mondal, the guardians attacked them. 

 Only the guardians had the right to elect the 14-member managing committee. 

 Polling agent Jamal Sheikh, a Congress functionary, was arrested for instigating fellow guardians. The trouble began when he apparently spread word that Mondal was helping CPM activists rig the poll. About 100 people, who were waiting outside, stormed the booth and dragged Mondal out, punching him. The headmaster fainted on the school ground. 

 A team from the local police outpost rushed in. At least 10 policemen, including three sub-inspectors, were injured and eight of them admitted to the block hospital with broken jaws and teeth. Three guardians were also injured. 

 Additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh said: ?A big reinforcement led by Nakashipara circle inspector A. Rashidujjaman had to fight a 200-strong mob, which pelted stones. We are looking for the other guardians, who are absconding.? 

 The election has been suspended.

 Quit blow to Mamata 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 17: In yet another setback to Mamata Banerjee, Arunava Ghosh, the Trinamul Congress legislator from Dum Dum, resigned from the party today protesting against the nomination of the wives of two corrupt councillors in Salt Lake.

 Ghosh, a lawyer who looked after legal affairs in the party, has also resigned from the Assembly.

 Mamata declined comment on the resignation. Partha Chatterjee, the MLA from Behala West and a member of the Trinamul disciplinary committee, said it would harm the party. It will help the ruling CPM campaign against us. Arunava is a good friend of mine and I call upon him to reconsider his decision, he added. 

 The Behala MLA indicated that the party would not accept Ghoshs resignation.

 Last month, mayor Subrata Mukherjee had broken away from the party with two mayor-in-council members, five MLAs and several councillors to float the Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha.

 Nayana Bandopadhyay, the MLA from Bowbazar and wife of former party MP Sudip Bandopadhyay, and Shibdas Mukherjee, the MLA from Krishnagar East, have been suspended for anti-party activities.

 Ghosh stuck to his decision to quit and alleged that Mamata had nominated Indrani Dutta ? wife of Sabyasachi ? in ward 10 and Nirmala Das ? wife of Ujjal ? in ward 3 of Bidhannagar municipality despite there being numerous charges of corruption against their husbands. Sabyasachi and Ujjals wards were reserved for women this year. 

 I wrote to Mamata time and again complaining against the two councillors involved in various anti-party activities. But to my utter surprise, their wives were nominated. This is an insult to me, Ghosh said, adding that he has sent a copy of his resignation to Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim.

 If Mamatas house is in trouble, so is the Congresss. Former state party chief Somen Mitra today made another bid to distance himself from the attack on Pranab Mukherjee, the defence minister and state Congress president . 

 Mitra told an election rally at Nabadwip in Nadia that he will call on Sonia Gandhi to apprise her of the identity of those involved in Sundays assault. Those who heckled Pranabda are anti-socials and I want stringent action against all of them, Mitra said.

 His aide Arun Das, a former Calcutta Municipal Corporation councillor, was suspended from the party yesterday for having led the attack.

 Congress supporters from Dass Taltala-Entally area today rallied behind their leader, who has fielded wife Sabita as an Independent from Calcutta corporations ward 55.

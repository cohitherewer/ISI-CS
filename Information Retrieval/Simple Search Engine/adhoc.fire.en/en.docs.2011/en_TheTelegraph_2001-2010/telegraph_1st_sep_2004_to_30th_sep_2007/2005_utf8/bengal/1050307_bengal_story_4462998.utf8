 A Darjeeling waterfall: Danger lurking?

 Siliguri, March 6: Police today asked the hotels in the hills and pockets of the plains to furnish details of guests.

 ?The aim is to make the hoteliers aware of the possibility that their establishments could be used by KLO and Ulfa extremists or the Maoists,? said Darjeeling superintendent of police Rajeev Mishra.

 Meetings were held at the police stations in Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong in the hills and Siliguri and Matigara to clarify to the hoteliers what the law-enforcers want.

 ?We especially want information on suspicious-looking visitors who put up at hotels frequently and are able to pay hefty bills. Such people could be having links with extremist or anti-social outfits,? Mishra said. 

 J. Haldar, the manager of a leading hotel in Siliguri, said hoteliers earlier had to submit to the district intelligence bureau daily reports on all foreigners checking in. 

 Two weeks ago, Siliguri police also made it mandatory for all landlords in the trading town to furnish details about their tenants ? names, family members, occupation and permanent addresses. 

 Though both norms existed before, they were not enforced. After two Nepal Maoists were recently arrested from an apartment here, the police decided to strengthen security.

 Mishra said about 370 hoteliers attended the meeting at Siliguri police station. Over a hundred were present at Darjeeling and Kalimpong. ?We have tried to include every establishment that offers boarding facilities, like lodges and paying-guest units,? said an officer.

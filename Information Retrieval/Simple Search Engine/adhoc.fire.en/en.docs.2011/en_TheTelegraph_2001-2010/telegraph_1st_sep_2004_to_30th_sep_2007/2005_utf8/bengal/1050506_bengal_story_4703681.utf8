 Hotel unions happy at last

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 5: The government today said the stalemate over Great Eastern Hotel was finally over.

 After separate meetings with the hotels Intuc and Citu leaders, commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen said: ?The discussions were very positive and fruitful and I feel the stalemate is over. I am happy.? 

 Leaders of both unions were happy as well. Ramen Pandey, the general secretary of the hotels Intuc union, said: ?We are happy with the talks. The response from the government was very positive.? Citu leader Rajdeo Goala said: ?We have full faith in the government.?

 Todays talks are expected to pave the way for more employees to apply for the Early Retirement Scheme. Most of them were scared to accept the ERS fearing the unions wrath. About a dozen out of over 400 picked up the forms.

 The government, on its part, has agreed to implement the career advancement scheme for the hotel employees that would raise their salary and also increase the amount they receive as ERS, a senior official said. 

 Pandey said: ?We were never against the privatisation. Our problem was that the government was not discussing the prickly issues with us. The impasse should now end amicably.?

 Liquor shops face Bloc

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 7: The Forward Bloc, it appears, has a drink problem. 

 After pulling up its Left Front Big Brother, the CPM, in public over issuing liquor licenses to generate more revenue, Bloc chairman Kamal Guha today said the party would launch an offensive against liquor shops in the state.

 ?Not only will our party workers demonstrate against new liquor shops, they will launch an agitation against those already existing,? Guha, the agriculture minister, said at his Writers? Buildings office.

 The Bloc leader has been in the habit of taking on his own government, much to the embarrassment of Writers?. Anil Biswas, the state CPM secretary, had called Guha ?irresponsible? and said he would have quit, if he was in his place. 

 Since the government decided to issue 1,000 licenses for liquor off-shops a year ago, the Bloc leader has been critical of the decision. Other front partners like the RSP and the CPI had also voiced opposition to the liquor policy, much in the same voice as the Opposition parties. 

 Alcoholism is a ?social problem?, the minister said today, adding that the Bloc supporters would launch a door-to-door campaign telling people about its ill effects.

 ?If the workers do not take part in this movement, their membership will be cancelled,? he warned. ?It is wrong to raise revenue from the sale of alcohol.? 

 Guha?s is not a lone voice in the party. The Bloc?s Calcutta district leader, Nihar Roychowdhury, thinks alcohol is ?just as bad as drugs? and, together, they are the two main evils in society.

 Referring to alcohol as a ?byproduct of globalisation?, Roychowdhury said: ?We want to save the youths from the clutches of the twin evils.?

 At a rally last week, Bloc leaders had said the government?s decision to issue more liquor licenses smacked of ?decadent culture?.

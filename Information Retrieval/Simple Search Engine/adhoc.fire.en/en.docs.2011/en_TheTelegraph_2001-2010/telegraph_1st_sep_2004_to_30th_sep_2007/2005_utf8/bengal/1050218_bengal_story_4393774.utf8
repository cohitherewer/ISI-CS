 Divorce raises HC eyebrows

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Feb. 17: Calcutta High Court today passed an interim stay on an exparte divorce decree, expressing surprise how a Jalpaiguri court passed the order in favour of the husband without hearing the wife. 

 Justice Subhra Kamal Mukherjee posted the case for hearing next week after he was told that Niren Mitra, manager of Binaguri Tea Estate near Jalpaiguri, sent the divorce order to his wife Shibani when she came for a holiday to Calcutta. The order had been issued on November 29, 2004, when Shibani was living with Mitra at Binaguri. 

 ?She (Shibani) along with her son Dipanjan, 20, and daughter Tania, 13, came from Binaguri on December 25 last year to spend the winter vacation with her uncle at Bosepukur in Kasba,? said Shibani?s lawyer Shiraj Gooptu. 

 On January 17, she received a chest by VPP and an envelope. Soon after, an anonymous call came asking her to open the envelope. In it she found the divorce order issued against her by a fast-track court in Jalpaiguri. 

 The same day, she received the key to the chest by courier and found her clothes inside. Another call followed, telling her not to return to Jalpaiguri. 

 Gooptu said they first moved the Jalpaiguri court for revision of the order as it was passed exparte. ?But the court declined to hear our plea,? he told the high court. 

 The case has brought into focus a petition moved late last year by lawyer Biswajit Basu, demanding that photos of the bride and groom be fixed on marriage certificates as well as divorce papers. 

 Basu had cited at least three incidents in which wives suddenly received divorce orders. ?In all the cases, the husbands had adopted a new method to cheat their wives. They approach a magistrate with a woman and claim they want mutual divorce. The court awards the divorce decree on the basis of their submissions while the real wives are in the dark,? he said.

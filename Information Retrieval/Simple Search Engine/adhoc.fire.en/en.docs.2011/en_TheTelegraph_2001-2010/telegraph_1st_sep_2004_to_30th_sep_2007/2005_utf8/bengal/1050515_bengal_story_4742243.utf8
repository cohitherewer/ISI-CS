 Fun school hits town

 - A physics lesson in the pool

 RICHA BANSAL

 Children ready for a splash: Study time?

 Calcutta, May 14: Instead of chalk and talk, take a walk!

 Six-year-old Vibhash Agarwal had a whale of a time at school splashing around in a pool. Before hitting the water, he spent a good 15 minutes in class making a beautiful little paper boat and blowing up a plastic ball as part of the preparatory exercise. On his way to the pool, he did not forget to pick up a stone from the ground as well. As he squealed around in the pool, his teacher made him observe how the ball and the boat, despite being larger in size remained afloat, while the stone sank to the bottom.

 Before he knew, Vibhash had learnt that objects lighter than water float and those that are heavier sink. He did not realise that he had learnt something even later on. It was an obvious fact for him, says his mother Richa. 

 Aditya Dhar, 5, came home from school and told his mother Rekha: This is my elbow and this is my shoulder joint. I can move my hands and do exercises because of these two. Then, pointing to his leg, he went on, This is my knee joint and because of it I can kick a football.? 

 Aditya had learnt his body parts in school. But instead of being taught from a textbook, each child of his class was made to point out his body parts and figure out what he could do with it and why.

 Vibhash is a student of Class II at St James School, Aditya is in Class I at Future Campus School. And if what they did sounds out of the ordinary, there is more in store with many schools in the city now taking to this system of teaching.

 Known as the thematic approach or experiential learning or the project method, it is designed to make learning fun. And it is in contrast to the usual chalk-and-talk method. 

 Although an age-old concept popular in the West and implemented in all international schools, it had not really taken off in the city. But now there is a genuine effort to implement this method as schools have become conscious of its need. Especially with children getting increasingly weighed down by the textbook approach, which can lead to an apathy towards studies later, says Devi Kar, principal, Modern High School for Girls. 

 The method is being implemented in novel ways. Silajit Ghosh, chairman, Future Campus School, shares an example. We took our children for a walk through our campus. During the walk, we encouraged them to discover the shortest route to reach a given spot. They learnt the basic principle of mensuration.

 While Future Campus plans to implement this system till Class 8, most schools like Nopany Vidyalaya, Mahadevi Birla Girls School, St James and Heritage School practice it only till the primary level. A few like Modern High, Birla High School and MP Birla Foundation Higher Secondary School apply it to some extent in the senior classes as well.

 Implementing the method successfully in higher classes requires a lot of planning, says Menakshi Atal, the Heritage School headmistress. Teachers have to devise innovative methods for making concepts clear to children, especially at the senior level, she adds.

 Educationists pointed out several pluses of the fun method. Mukta Nain, the Birla High School for Boys principal, said: Both retention and assimilation are much stronger because children first experience what they learn instead of having to imagine it. 

 Angela Ghose, the the head of the primary section at St James, said: It also helps develop independent thinking.

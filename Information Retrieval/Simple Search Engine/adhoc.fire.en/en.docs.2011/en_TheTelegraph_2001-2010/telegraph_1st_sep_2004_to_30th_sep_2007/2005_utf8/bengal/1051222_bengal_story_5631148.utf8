 Cop held for setting woman on fire

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Cooch Behar, Dec. 21: Constable 

 Dilip Sonam was arrested today in connection with the death 

 of a housewife, Namita Kar, on the premises of the Mathabhanga 

 police station.

 Namita, who sustained 80 per cent burns, reportedly told her mother, Chhaya Deb, that last evening, Sonam set her on fire after dousing her with kerosene in a kitchen in the police station compound around 40 km from Cooch Behar.

 Namita was admitted to the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital and died at night.

 Sonam was arrested and placed under suspension after Chhaya Deb lodged a complaint.

 Police sources said Namitas husband Dilip Kar is a carpenter and lives in Fakirerkuthi village in Mathabhanga.

 Namita used to work as a domestic help in the police quarters and the constables kitchen located within the police station campus. She has a four-year-old son.

 Cooch Behar police superintendent, Jagmohan, said Sonam had been remanded in five days police custody for interrogation. 

 We suspended the constable last night and we are investigating whether Sonam had an affair with the woman, the district police chief said. 

 The police have started a murder case against the constable.

 Sonam had said that Namita did not work for him but used to make tea for him sometimes, said a senior police officer.

 Officers have been asked to be vigilant about the women who came to work in the barracks.

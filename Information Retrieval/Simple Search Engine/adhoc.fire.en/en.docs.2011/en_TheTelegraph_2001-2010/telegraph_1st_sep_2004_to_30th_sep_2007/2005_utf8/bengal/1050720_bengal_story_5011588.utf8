 HC okays job for late fathers married girl

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 19: The high court today set aside a government decision that restricted recruitment of married daughters of employees dying in harness.

 This policy is contrary to the Indian Constitution, arbitrary and bad in law. The government should not follow the policy, Justice Girish Chandra Gupta said.

 The judge also asked the North 24-Parganas inspector of schools to consider the application of Meherunnisa, the married daughter of the late headmaster of Rajpur High School, Sheikh Kalam. 

 Meherunnisa had sought a job in her fathers school after his death. 

 Todays ruling is unlikely to be limited to school appointments. According to legal circles, it would be referred to in other cases relating to jobs sought by married daughters of government employees who die in harness. 

 There should not be any discrimination between a son and a daughter while providing jobs after a parents death. This was my simple argument that has been accepted by the court, said Ekramul Bari, the lawyer for Meherunnisa. He added that after the court order, the inspector of schools had no option but to appoint his client in the school where her father was headmaster.

 Kalam died at the age of 54 on December 15, 2003, leaving behind his wife and four daughters. 

 As her mother was 50 and unlettered, Meherunnisa applied to the district inspector of schools for a job in her fathers institution so that she could maintain the family.

 Kalams widow also gave an undertaking that she had no objection if her graduate daughter got the job. She said she was sure that though her daughter was married, she would look after her mother. The undertaking highlighted their financial crisis ? her other daughters are still studying ? the need for the job on compassionate grounds.

 Meherunnisa did not get the job. In a letter dated March 24, 2004, the inspector of schools informed her about the government policy that restrained him from offering a job on compassionate grounds as she was married.

 She challenged the policy. Bari pleaded with the high court to ask the government not to discriminate between a son and a daughter when women were increasingly vocal about equal rights.

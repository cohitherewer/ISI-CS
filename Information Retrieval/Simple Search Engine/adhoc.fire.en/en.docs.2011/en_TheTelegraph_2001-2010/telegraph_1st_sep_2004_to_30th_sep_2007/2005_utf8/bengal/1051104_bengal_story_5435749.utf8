 Balurghat, Nov. 3: With the partys South Dinajpur Big Two ? former district secretary Manabesh Chowdhury and former minister Narayan Biswas ? locked up, other CPM leaders who had been evading arrest for years know their number is up.

 Zilla parishad sabhadhipati (chief) Mohiuddin Ahmed and former president of the Gangarampur panchayat samiti, Sitaram Kisku, are among them.

 Both are members of the partys district committee and prominent leaders of Gangarampur, to which Biswas belonged. They have non-bailable warrants in their name in the same case of arson at Ratanpur that has landed the Big Two in custody.

 In Calcutta, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas said: There are 60-70 CPM activists who are facing criminal charges and have not yet appeared in court (despite having warrants issued against them). The party has instructed them to surrender in court and try to obtain bail within a month.

 District secretariat member Asit Sarkar said: There is no ambiguity concerning their surrender. The partys state committee has already announced the official line. We are only working out about the date and time of their surrender. 

 Ahmed had earlier claimed that he had already obtained bail, but district Trinamul Congress chief Biplab Mitra rubbished it.

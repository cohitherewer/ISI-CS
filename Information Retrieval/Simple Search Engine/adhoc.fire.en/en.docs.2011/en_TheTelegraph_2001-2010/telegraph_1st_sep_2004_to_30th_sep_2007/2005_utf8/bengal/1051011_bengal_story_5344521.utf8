 Front sets up Salim second round

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 10: The CPM will have a second round of talks with its Left Front partners to shoot down possibility of further problem regarding the Salim Group projects in South 24-Parganas and Howrah before its boss, Benny Santoso, arrives here on October 20. 

 The front partners still have some reservations about the proposed projects and we want to sort them out at the earliest, a key CPM functionary said today. 

 Santosos schedule includes a meeting with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen and a recce of the areas where the projects would come up.

 Bhattacharjee is expected to accompany the Salim brass to some of the sites in South 24-Parganas and Howrah.

 The final schedule from the Salim Group is expected to reach by October 14 and then we shall finalise the tour programme, said S.A. Ahmed, the special secretary to the chief minister. 

 The CPM had earlier held talks separately with all three major partners ? the CPI, Forward Bloc and the RSP ? and they had pointed out that farmland should not be handed over to industry. 

 We are expecting a call from the CPM before October 20, said Ashok Ghosh, the Bloc state secretary. 

 RSP Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Bhattacharjee said it would be good if the CPM discusses the proposed projects with the partners before the Salim officials arrive. 

 All three partners had earlier accused the chief minister of keeping them in the dark about the Salim projects. Buddhadeb did not even bother to brief us about the outcome of his visit to Singapore and Jakarta, an RSP leader had complained.

 Bhattacharjee then submitted a note to the partners at a front meeting and sought their opinion. 

 CPM insiders said that with months to go for the Assembly elections, the party is keen to put behind differences within the front. 

 Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, who earlier tried to woo the CPMs unhappy allies, has decided to block all entry points to the city on October 20. We shall not allow the Salim chairman to enter the city, come what may, she said.

 Party general secretary Mukul Roy said: The administration will be responsible if any untoward incident occurs that day.

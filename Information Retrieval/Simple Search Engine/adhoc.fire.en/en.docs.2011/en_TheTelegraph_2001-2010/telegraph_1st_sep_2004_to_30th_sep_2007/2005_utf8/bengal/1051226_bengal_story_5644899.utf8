 Cong hints at deal with Trinamul

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 25: The state Congress leadership today hinted at an alliance with the Trinamul Congress without disturbing the latters equation with the BJP.

 Union information and broadcasting minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee would soon take up the matter with Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee.

 However, observers believe that even if an alliance is forged, it would have to be an unofficial one, as the Congress would not approve of an electoral pact with a party having links with the BJP.

 Mamata had written to Pranab babu for talks on a possible electoral pact. He has informed Mamata that he would be ready for talks after the Lok Sabha session is over by December 23. Pranab babu is expected to speak to Mamata shortly, Das Munshi said.

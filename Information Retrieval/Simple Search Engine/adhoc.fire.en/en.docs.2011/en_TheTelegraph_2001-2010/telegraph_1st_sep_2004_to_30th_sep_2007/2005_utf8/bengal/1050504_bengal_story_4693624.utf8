 Job carrot for hotel staff

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 3: The government is telling the prospective buyers of Great Eastern Hotel that it would ?prefer? employees who have accepted the early retirement scheme to be given priority in reappointment while filling up vacancies in the new set-up.

 The preference has been incorporated in the ?draft shareholders? agreement? that will be discussed with the possible buyers soon, a senior government official said at Writers? Buildings today. 

 It has been suggested in the draft that preference for reappointment be given ?after assessing their individual experience and skills while filling up vacancies that may arise post the closing date?. 

 Public enterprises and industrial reconstruction secretary Sunil Mitra said: ?The government will arrange training for the interested employees to help them upgrade their skills.? 

 Sources said the government is sceptical about the re-employment prospects of the employees unless they are trained afresh.

 It is for the first time that the government has incorporated the provision for reappointment officially ? something it had been promising the unions for long. 

 However, many suspect that this is just a ploy to persuade more employees to accept the ERS, the deadline for which is May 18. Only a dozen employees have taken the ERS forms yet and eight have submitted them. 

 Others feel it is an eyewash to keep unions in good humour because, in any case, the government will have little stake in the new set-up ? 10 per cent or even less.

 Officials at Writers? said the draft agreement would be discussed with the potential buyers at the bidders? meet, indicating that it might be subjected to alterations.

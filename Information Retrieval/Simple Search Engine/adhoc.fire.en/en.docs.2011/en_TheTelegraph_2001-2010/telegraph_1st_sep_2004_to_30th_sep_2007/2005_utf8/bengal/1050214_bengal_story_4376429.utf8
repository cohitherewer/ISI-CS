 11 killed in train crash replay

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Banarhat (Jalpaiguri), Feb. 13: A passenger train rammed into a van, killing 11 passengers at the same spot where four had died in a similar accident last year.

 The Alipurduar-Siliguri Junction Passenger, which hit a school bus on April 27, 2004, ripped through a pick-up van packed with people going to a wedding this afternoon, leaving 11 people dead and eight injured.

 Five of the dead belonged to Bharat Band Party of Malbazar, hired to play brass instruments and drums at the wedding. Two of them have been identified as Sona Sheikh, 33, and Anu Naik, 14. 

 Seven people died on the spot. Four succumbed to injuries at Sulkapara primary health centre and Malbazar Subdivisional Hospital.

 Police said Sudama Prasad, 32, the owner-driver of the van, Charua Oraon, 50, Tapas Sharma, 18, Ashok Toppo, 17, Rajen Oraon, 17 and Narayan Bhagat, 30, have also been identified as dead.

 Two of the injured have been taken to North Bengal Medical College and Hospital, Siliguri, and one person to Malbazar hospital.

 There is no clue about a quartet. The police suspect they have been taken to some other hospital by rescuers, who rushed from the neighbouring tea gardens.

 Witnesses said the train hit the pick-up van with an ear-splitting crash, the impact crushing the vehicle into a mangled mass. ?The van was carried a good 200 yards by the train. Two bodies were found smashed against the cow-catcher.?

 The casualties were friends and relatives of Sanjib Khalko ? the groom ? a resident of Sukhanibusty near Nagrakata, about 60 km from Jalpaiguri town. 

 Sanjib, who was travelling ahead of the pick-up in a Maruti van, proceeded to the wedding. The police confirmed that he did not return to the site of the accident and that his wedding to Ruma Bhagat at Ambari Tea Estate was completed this evening.

 ?The crossing is unmanned because we have categories based on train and road traffic data,? said Pampa Babbar, a manager of Northeast Frontier Railway?s Alipurduar division. ?The van driver did not possess a valid license. We are probing the incident,? she added.

 Differences delay CPM list

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 12: Differences over the selection of the candidate for one ward has delayed the finalisation of the CPMs list of nominees for the Bidhannagar municipal polls slated for June 19.

 The North 24-Parganas district secretariat today referred the matter to the state leadership after it failed to reach a consensus in ward 22. CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said: There is no problem in selecting our candidates in Salt Lake and we will announce the list tomorrow.

 Party members in North 24-Parganas were divided over the selection of Ramesh Bar, a close associate of MP Amitava Nandi. Bar was elected in ward 22 last time and is favoured by some party members for candidature in the same ward this time too. But a section of party leaders have objected to his selection.

 The CPM has also failed to project any leader as the chairperson, though it has projected Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharjee as the Calcutta Municipal Corporation mayor.

 The finalisation of the list for the Bidhannagar civic body was delayed by infighting. We will not project anyone as the chairman of Bidhannagar municipality and the chairman will be selected after the elections to the civic body is over, said the state CPM secretary.

 Some CPM leaders in the district wanted to project Amitava Nandis wife, Ila, as the chairperson of the civic body. However, others wanted to offer her a seat in the Assembly next year.

 Some prominent candidates in the list of 22 nominees finalised so far are Nandadulal Bhattacharya, transport minister Subhas Chakrabortys brother-in-law from ward 9, and Biswajiban Majumdar who is contesting in ward 10 from where Dilip Gupta, the chairman of the civic body had contested. Gupta and his deputy, Sudhangshu Sekhar Ganguly, have been dropped this time. Shaswati Mondal has replaced Ganguly in ward 13.

 Big event: CM

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today described the municipal polls in the state as a major political event and said people from the rest of the country are anxious to know the result.

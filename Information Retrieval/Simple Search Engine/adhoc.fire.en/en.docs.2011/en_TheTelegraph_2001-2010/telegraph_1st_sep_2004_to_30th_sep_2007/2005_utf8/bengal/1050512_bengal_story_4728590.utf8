 Debt drives farmer to death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, May 11: Crushed under the burden of a debt after thunderstorms destroyed his crops last week, a farmer has committed suicide.

 Deshbandhu Majhi, 27, of Boaichandi village in Khandaghosh in Burdwan, 180 km from Calcutta, consumed pesticide on Sunday night and died three days later at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital.

 The thunderstorms accompanied by hail? destroyed his standing boro crop across eight bighas and Deshbandhu realised he would not be able to pay up the loan of Rs 26,000 that he had taken from a local moneylender for cultivation, said Durgashankar Majhi, Desbandhus uncle. 

 The 27-year-old has left behind his widow, three daughters and ageing parents. 

 Police sent his body for post-mortem. SP N.K. Singh said a case of unnatural death has been started following complaints lodged by the victims family. We are inquiring whether there is any other reason behind his suicide.

 Last weeks thunderstorms razed standing boro crops, oilseeds and vegetables across 6,700 hectares of 15 gram panchayats in Burdwan. 

 Sabhadhipati Uday Sarkar said the damage has been estimated at Rs 6 crore. There has been a Rs 2-crore loss in Khandaghosh and Raina areas alone. A large number of farmers have been affected. We have asked the respective panchayats to visit affected farmers and counsel them? not to take drastic steps like suicides, he said.

 Flood toll 26, farm loss Rs 400 crore

 OUR BUREAU

 Oct. 25: The flood toll in south Bengal rose to 26 today with five more deaths being reported from East Midnapore. 

 Enteric diseases that came close on the heels of the deluge claimed two-year-old Sudip Maity of Khejuri Block-I, Panchanan Kayal, 55, of Bhagwanpur and Manmatha Mandal, 75, of Nandigram. 

 Gangaram Roy, 55, of Khejuri Block-II died after a wall collapsed on him while Jyoti Gharui, 60, was washed away when going to collect relief materials in Bhagwanpur. 

 The districts chief medical officer, Subrata Dutta, said water-borne diseases were being fought on a war footing. A control room has been set up at the district headquarters and health officers of 15 blocks have been asked to keep in touch with it. 

 The government claimed that only 13 people ? six in East Midnapore, five in South 24-Parganas and one each in West Midnapore and Howrah ? have died. 

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta said about 30 lakh people had been affected. Agricultural losses were estimated at around Rs 400 crore. The loss of infrastructure is yet to be calculated in terms of money. Flowers and betel leaves on around 4,000 hectares and 2.7 lakh hectares of paddy were damaged, besides many vegetables. 

 The government, officials said, is contemplating offering free seeds and subsidy on fertilisers to farmers.

 Rain is no longer the problem, but water is now moving into the low-lying areas, Dasgupta said at Writers Buildings after an assessment of the situation along with irrigation minister Biswanath Chowdhury. Our irrigation department has its own system of checking the weather and no new depression has been indicated, he added. 

 Dasgupta said East Midnapore received about 700 mm of rain over six days, something unusual in the second half of October. More foodgrain, cooked food, tarpaulins and drinking water are being sent to the distress zones.

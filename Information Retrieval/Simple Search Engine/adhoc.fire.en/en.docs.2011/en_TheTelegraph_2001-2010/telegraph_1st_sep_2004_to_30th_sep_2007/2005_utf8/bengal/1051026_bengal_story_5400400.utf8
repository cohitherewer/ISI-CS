 State awaits CPM nod on retail

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 25: Days after representatives of retail giant Wal-Mart stepped into Writers Buildings to discuss setting shop in the state, commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen said the CPM needed time to decide whether to allow foreign direct investment in the sector.

 We have an apprehension that the small trader would be seriously affected if FDI is allowed in retail, Sen said, adding: A clearer picture would emerge only after the current debate in the party concludes.

 After the meeting with Wal-Mart executives, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said: We will consider the proposal but it is going to take time. The hint was that the outcome of the debate in the party would influence his governments response.

 Sen will lead a three-member team that would tour China for 10 days from November 6 showcasing Bengals strengths as an investment destination. Beijing, Guang Dong and Shanghai would be some of their stops. The trio will meet government officials and representatives of local chambers of commerce. 

 Accompanying Sen will be commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen and West Bengal Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation managing director Atri Bhattacharya. 

 The team will highlight the potential of leather, toy-manufacturing, petrochemical, food processing, automobile and IT industries in the state. 

 Sen said the visit is a starting point to find out where Bengal stands in the perception of the Chinese.

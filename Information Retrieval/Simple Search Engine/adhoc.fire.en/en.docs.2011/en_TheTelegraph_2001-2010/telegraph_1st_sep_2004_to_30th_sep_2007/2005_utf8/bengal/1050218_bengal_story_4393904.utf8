 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Feb. 17: Four girls, missing from Baruipur and Joynagar in South 24-Parganas, were rescued from red light areas of Mumbai and Pune and handed over to their parents today. 

 Police said the teenagers had been lured with job promises. 

 Calcutta: A fire broke out at the under-construction Manikanchan gems and jewellery park at sector V in Salt Lake around 9.15 pm. Four fire tenders were pressed into service to control the fire, which is suspected to have begun after an LPG cylinder burst. 

 Santiniketan: Visva-Bharati University will restrict the entry of visitors to watch Basanta Utsab at Gour Prangan. It will issue gate passes for the cultural programme during Holi, but is yet to decide on the number. The university will also observe Rabindranath Tagore?s birthday on Pachishey Baisakh (May 9) instead of Poila Baisakh from this year. The decision was prompted by a change in the dates of the summer vacation. 

 Chinsurah: Sheikh Imran, 19, was killed and his friend was critically injured when they smashed into a trackside post near Bandel station while hanging out of a suburban train.

 US is OK, if its money comes here

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 21: The Marxists might berate the Manmohan Singh government for toeing the US line, but they would not mind flow of American funds into Bengal, if possible before the Assembly polls.

 Our campaign for US investment and our ideological battle against US imperialism are two different things that need to be viewed in separate contexts, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas said today. We are trying to industrialise Bengal without getting ensnared in an ideological debate on the colour of capital. 

 Ahead of finance minister Asim Dasguptas visit to the US, in the course of which he would deliver lectures at his alma mater, MIT, and meet chief executives of various companies, the CPM said it will explore the possibility of attracting investments from both the US and China. 

 Our government is taking the initiative to bring in more foreign capital before the 2006 elections, Jyoti Basu said after a CPM state secretariat meeting. We have no objection regarding US capital for Bengals development.

 The state secretariat, the partys apex decision-making body in Bengal, today green-lighted Dasgupta and commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sens visits to the US and China to seek investments for Bengal. 

 On their return, the two ministers will submit reports to both the party and the government on the outcome of their initiatives.

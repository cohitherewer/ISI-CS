 EC glare on clubs 

 Calcutta, Dec. 12: The Election Commission has sought a report from the states chief electoral officer on polling stations located in local clubs. 

 Debashis Sen, the electoral officer, said the commission had received complaints that many polling stations are housed in clubs that are not politically neutral. Reports of seven such polling stations in Jalpaiguri have reached the commission. The EC sent us an instruction today to compile a list of such polling stations, Sen said. 

 Although there is no directive yet to shift these polling stations, there are indications that an order might follow.

 Asked if proof of voters identity would be checked in the queue ? as in the Asansol bypoll, which the CPM won ? instead of in polling booths as usual, Sen said the matter is under consideration.

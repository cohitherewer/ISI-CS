 Power balm

 Calcutta, April 27: The power situation in Calcutta and some other parts of the state improved marginally today with the combined shortfall in areas served by the CESC and the state electricity board falling to 375 MW, about 100 MW less than yesterday. 

 Power department sources said the SEB stepped up its supply to the CESC grid and contributed about 250 MW to the private power utility during peak hours in the evening. 

 ?The situation is likely to improve further tomorrow,? an SEB official said.

 The districts, however, continued to suffer long power cuts as the deficit shot up to nearly 300 MW.

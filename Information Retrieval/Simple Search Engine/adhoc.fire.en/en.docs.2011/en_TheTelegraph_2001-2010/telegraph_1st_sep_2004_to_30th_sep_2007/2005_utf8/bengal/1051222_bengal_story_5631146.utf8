 Govt eyes FDI in education

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 21: The state government is ready to encourage foreign investment in setting up institutions for higher studies, particularly in emerging areas.

 Investment from only Indian industries is not enough to open new avenues in higher education. We need foreign investment, said higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty, addressing the closing ceremony of Jadavpur Universitys golden jubilee celebrations today.

 He said several foreign agencies, including one from the US, have approached the state government for setting up new institutes in Calcutta and in the districts. We are examining their proposals, he said. We are also examining our policies concerning foreign investment in higher education.

 The minister, however, refused to disclose the names of the foreign organisations which have submitted applications for investment in higher education.

 Some Indian business groups, too, have shown interest in investing in education projects in Bengal. While the Ambanis have submitted proposals to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee for setting up a private university, an information and communication technology institute and a Chinese studies centre, the RPG Group has submitted a plan for a business school of international standards in Calcutta.

 Justifying the governments stand on foreign investment, Chakraborty said nearly Rs 700 crore is spent by the government on higher education every year. Around 90 per cent of this is used for salaries of teachers and non-teaching employees of the 340-odd state-aided colleges and 11 universities. In such a situation, we have to think of foreign investment if we want to open new institutes, he said.

 There are certain emerging areas ? biotechnology, biosciences, nanotechnology, nanosciences and IT ? which are most sought after by our best students, an official in the higher education department said. We have to satisfy the demand if we want to see the state progressing.

 These institutes need to be equipped with advanced laboratories and must have adequate infrastructure for which huge investment is required. Along with big players from the industry, foreign investment is also needed.

 What we need to do now is to adopt an effective policy to ensure that only the most efficient and professional groups are allowed to open institutes here, the official said.

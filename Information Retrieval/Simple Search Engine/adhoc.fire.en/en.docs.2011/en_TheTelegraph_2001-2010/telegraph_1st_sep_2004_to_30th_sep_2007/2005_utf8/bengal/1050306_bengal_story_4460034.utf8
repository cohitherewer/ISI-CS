Roma script rerun, plus rape amp; return 

Salt Lake schoolgirl turned in by kidnapper kin

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 5: A 16-year-old who went missing on her way to school was brought back a week later by the relatives of her kidnapper, who had allegedly raped her.

 The girl, who lives in Salt Lake ? where Roma Jhawar had been abducted a month ago ? did not reach school on the morning of February 24. 

 Her brother Pijush Sarkar lodged a complaint with East Bidhannagar police station three days later.

 The girl, whose family runs a grocery store in Nayapatti, returned home yesterday afternoon, escorted by three women. 

 Police last night arrested the three ? Panchali, Rekha and Chaitali ? who are relatives of the main accused, Subhas Mondal, from their residence in Patharghata of Rajarhat. 

 Subhas is absconding.

 ?My sister studies in Class VII in a school in Kestopur. Like everyday, she was going to school that day when a young man in his twenties, later identified as Subhas Mondal by the police, reportedly kidnapped her. He later hid my sister in different places and raped her,? alleged Pijush.

 The police started investigations after Pijush lodged a missing diary. It was revealed that Subhas had earlier proposed to the girl and would often disturb her on her way to school.

 ?A neighbour informed us that he had noticed my sister being taken in a car on her way to school that day,? Pijush recalled. 

 ?After kidnapping her, Subhas took her to several hideouts ? in Ghutiarisharif, Canning and his house in Rajarhat. It was in Rajarhat that Subhas?s mother Panchali and aunts Rekha and Chaitali came to know about the girl and that she had been kidnapped. To hush up the matter, they sent Subhas?s brother Palash to the girl?s family. Palash cautioned them against lodging a complaint with the police,? said T. Bose, the additional superintendent of police of Bidhannagar. 

 Yesterday, the three women took the girl home. 

 Back from more than a week in captivity, the teenager told her family that she had been raped by Subhas. 

 The police said the three women were arrested ?as they helped Subhas in illegal and forceful confinement of the girl?.

 The case today came up before the court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate Aloke Chowdhury, who asked the police to conduct a medical examination of the girl and submit a report by March 19. 

 The three women were remanded in police custody till then.

 Rejecting their bail plea, Chowdhury said more investigations are required as the diary does not have sufficient information. 

 ?A confidential statement of the girl was recorded in the presence of the magistrate,? said Anjan Chowdhury, the public prosecutor. 

 Soumyajit Raha and Abinabha Majumder, who appeared for the arrested trio, accused the police of falsely framing them. ?Isn?t it strange that the police arrested those who had brought the girl back to the safety of her home? The police are trying to hush up their failure to rescue the girl by framing these women who had actually helped her,? Raha said.

 Bail for ?hair-pull? teacher

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 16: Ruma Pal, the teacher of Our Lady Queen of the Missions school, was granted bail today, exactly a month after she was charged with yanking off a tuft of hair from a nursery student?s scalp.

 On March 16, Varnika Gupta?s father Hitesh Gupta had lodged a complaint at Bidhannagar (South) police station against Pal. He alleged that the teacher had pulled out a bunch of his daughter?s hair because she had not brought a plastic bag to carry back her artwork.

 The school had supported Pal, saying investigations revealed that she had not hurt Varnika. 

 The teacher reportedly told the school authorities that she had pulled the girl?s ear for misbehaving in class. 

 Pal today appealed for bail in the court of Aloke Chowdhury, the sub-divisional judicial magistrate, Bidhannagar.

 Police officials in Salt Lake said they were preparing reports in the case. 

 ?We will submit the medical and other reports to the court soon,? said an official. 

 Varnika had undergone two medical tests ? one at the Bidhannagar subdivisional hospital and another at the Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital.

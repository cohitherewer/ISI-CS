 Clash of CU exam and entry

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, May 14: The higher secondary councils decision to announce the HS results of 2005 by June 10 has placed Calcutta University in a fix.

 With the Supreme Court setting the deadline for the publication of plus-II marks, the HS results will be declared at least a month earlier than usual. That means admission to BA, BSc and BCom first-year classes in the 153 colleges affiliated to the university will also have to be conducted earlier. 

 But the universitys Part I examinations ? involving over 70,000 students ? will be on till mid-July. It is difficult to conduct admissions on exam days. The colleges will be taken over by our examination department, said Suranjan Das, the pro-VC (academic).

 The court had further directed all plus-II boards to ensure that every examinee gets the mark sheet by June 15. 

 The universitys undergraduate council met yesterday to work out a strategy to tackle the situation. It is impossible to reschedule the exam dates. There is also a UGC order saying the admissions have to be completed within a month of the declaration of HS results, a council member said.

 The council is mulling keeping the colleges open on holidays during the exam period. Das said: All principals will be requested to ensure that teachers and employees remain present on Saturdays till the crisis is over.

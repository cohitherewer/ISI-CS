 11-year-old scalded, whipped and beaten

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chinsurah, Nov. 18: An 11-year-old domestic help was scalded, whipped and thrashed by her employers but police in Hooghlys Balagarh did not find her complaint fit to be registered as an FIR.

 Binita Das is now fighting for life at Kalna Subdivisional Hospital in Burdwan with bruises all over her body. I was burned with a rod, whipped with a belt and beaten up, she recounted from her hospital bed, 160 km from Calcutta. 

 Binita was employed at the house of Amitava Paul in Barrackpore, North 24-Parganas, to assist his ailing wife in chores. After a round of torture on November 12, Paul allegedly tried to dump her at Behula station, the nearest to her home at Balagarh in Hooghly, about 90 km from Calcutta.

 Local people caught him there and took him to the police. Paul a medical representative by profession, was allegedly offered dinner and cigarettes by the officer-in-charge of the Balagarh police station.

 Binitas mother Renu and sister Mridula met Hooghly police chief Supratim Sarkar yesterday with a five-page complaint signed by hundreds of villagers that said that they were made to wait for over six hours as the OC laid out the red carpet to the alleged culprit. The officer-in-charge, Partha Paul refused to lodge the FIR and asked us to settle the matter for Rs 1,500.

 Sarkar said deputy superintendent Deepak Mitra would probe the case and submit a report to him at the earliest. I have asked the Balagarh police to register the case against Paul and transfer it to Titagarh police station in North 24-Parganas as it covers the employers home, where the girl was tortured. 

 Partha Paul declined comment. Amitava Paul was not available at home.

 I would have been killed had I stayed there for a day more, Binita said.

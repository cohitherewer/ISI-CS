 Extortionist heat on farm, cops cool heels

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARYA

 Barasat, March 9: When the government is desperately promoting entrepreneurship among the unemployed, the dreams of 30 youths trying to set up something of their own have all but been smashed by an extortionist backed by political dadas and an incapacitated police.

 At Chaturia near here, about 40 km from Calcutta, the youths teamed up to start a pisciculture and poultry cooperative last August. They identified a plot, where a brick kiln used to be, to set up the farm.

 ?We struck a deal with the kiln owner, Madhusudan Das, who wanted to sell the land as he was making losses. We raised funds by mortgaging our property and taking loans from a bank,? said Robin Patra, a member of the cooperative. 

 But they had not taken into account Fikir Ali. Said to be close to an influential CPM leader of North 24-Parganas, he has his own business ? supplying soil to brick kilns. But the business, one of the youths alleged, is made profitable by extortion and coercion.

 Fikir prevented the youths from taking possession of the plot, saying they would first have to cough up Rs 2 lakh and set aside a portion of the plot for a playground. The consequences of not following the order would be grave, they were told.

 The cooperative?s repeated pleas to Barasat police to rein in Fikir fell on deaf ears. Three complaints ? lodged on November 25, December 5 and 12 ? failed to evoke a single response. Officers at the Barasat police station declined comment. One of them asserted that Fikir was not a criminal. 

 Patra said: ?We were hardly prepared for this sort of extortion. Our ministers have been urging unemployed youths to go for self-employment, but they have done little to contain anti-socials out to frustrate our efforts to chart our own course.?

 Each time Patra and his friends went to the site, Ali and his henchmen threatened them and drove them away. Minus police help, they could not put up any resistance.

 Ujir Ali, another member of the cooperative, said: ?We are passing through a peculiar phase. We are yet to start business, but have to repay the loans with interest.? 

 ?We are local youths? but still the resistance?. Maybe, we?ll have to move out,? said Tapan Gupta. ?We are all victims of Fikir Ali?s extortion racket,? he added. 

 Like Patra, Ali and Gupta, Rajen Das, Aloke Dutta and the rest are going through the same peculiar phase.

 Fikir has no qualms about his demand. ?I asked for the money and the land in the interest of the local school and club. There?s nothing wrong in it. As the youths are going to invest a lot of money in their business, they are in a position to meet my demands. They are 30 in number and each of them has to donate a small amount,? he said. 

 Praveen Kumar, the district superintendent of police, said he is not aware of the problem. ?I will look into it,? he said.

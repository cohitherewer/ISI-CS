 BRIEFS

 Purulia, June 26: The minister for jails and social welfare was today greeted with howls of protest by inmates of the district and womens jails here who complained that they were not being provided the fish and meat due to them.

 Many of them also alleged before Biswanath Chowdhury that the warders were smuggling out their food. An inmate is supposed to get 100 g of meat and two pieces of fish on alternate days. Forget 100 grams, we do not even get 50, a convict reportedly told the minister who went on a routine check.

 Bhadreswar: Tamoghna Bhattacharya, 15, who got over 80 per cent in five subjects in Madhyamik, committed suicide on Friday apparently because she could not do well in mathematics. The student of Krishnabhamini Vidyamandir hanged herself from the ceiling of a toilet at her grandfathers home in Hooghly. Swapan Bhattacharya, a railway employee, said his daughter got 55 in math and was depressed since the results were declared. Six girls have committed suicide since the Madhyamik results were published. 

 Bolpur: An idol made of an amalgam of eight metals, said to be over a century old, and two others of antique value were found missing from a temple at Sriniketan on Sunday. Debidas Acharya, the priest of the temple, around 200 km from Calcutta, detected the theft when he went to perform puja in the morning. A sniffer dog from Barrackpore in North 24-Parganas was later taken to the temple.

 Calcutta: The government has allotted Rs 5.22 crore for the retirement benefits of Calcutta State Transport Corporation employees. CSTC managing director Asoke Bhattacharya said Rs 3.7 crore has already been disbursed among 4,413 employees.

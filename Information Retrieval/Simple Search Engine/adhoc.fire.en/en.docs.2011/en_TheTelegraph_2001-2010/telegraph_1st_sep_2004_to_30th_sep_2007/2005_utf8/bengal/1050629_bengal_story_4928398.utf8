 Trinamul fury on Halim mike 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 28: Trinamul Congress legislators today wrenched away the Speakers microphone and swept away papers from his desk after being denied permission to move an adjournment motion on massive rigging by CPM workers during the civic polls.

 Halim rejected Trinamul chief whip Sobhandeb Chattopadhyays request but allowed the Congress chief whip, Asit Mitra, to read a motion on the same subject, triggering howls of protest and then the scenes of violence.

 As the Speaker called Mitra to read his motion, Chattopadhyay stood up and demanded that he be allowed to speak first as he had moved the motion earlier. The appeal was turned down. 

 Amid slogan shouting and cries of unfair play, Mitra somehow managed to read his adjournment motion and eventually staged a walkout along with other Congress members as the Speaker rejected it.

 Halim then asked Chattopadhyay to proceed, but as the Trinamul MLAs continued to test their lung power SUCIs Debaprasad Sarkar got his chance. 

 But before Sarkar could read his motion, Chattopadhyay rushed to him and snatched his papers.

 Almost all Trinamul legislators then came down to the well, threw away papers from the Speakers desk and uprooted his microphone to protest against his partisan role. 

 They started thumping on Halims desk and continued to shout.

 The marshal and the Assemblys watch and ward staff threw a cordon around the Speaker, whose repeated pleas to restore order fell on deaf ears. 

 As some members from the treasury benches, including government chief whip Rabin Deb, moved towards the Speakers podium to rein in the Trinamul members, a scuffle ensued. In the absence of senior ministers, the yelling match went on. 

 Social welfare minister Biswanath Chowdhury and forest minister Jogesh Burman tried to pacify the members, but in vain. 

 The Trinamul legislators staged a walkout after bringing normal business to a standstill for about half an hour.

 Chattopadhyay later alleged that the Speaker had edited his adjournment motion and favoured the Congress. 

 Halim denied the charge. I have been in the chair for the past 23 years and did not edit a single line of any motion. My officers sometimes delete unparliamentary words as they cannot be used inside the House, he said. 

 The members must learn to behave, the Speaker said. They must remember that the Assembly is a platform for debate and discussion, a symbol of democracy. 

 The RSPs Tapan Hore brought a motion condemning the incident.

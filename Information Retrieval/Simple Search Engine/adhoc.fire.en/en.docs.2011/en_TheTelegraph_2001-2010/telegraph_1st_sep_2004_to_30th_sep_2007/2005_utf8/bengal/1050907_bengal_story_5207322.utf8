 Duo on mission to mend front cracks

 Basu, Biswas: Eye on polls

 Calcutta, Sept 6: The CPM 

 leadership today decided to engage Jyoti Basu and Anil Biswas 

 to placate party functionaries believed to be disgruntled 

 over the governments move to hand over farmland to 

 the Indonesia-based Salim Group for setting up an industrial 

 city.

 The two leaders will address the secretaries of over 200 branch committees in South 24-Parganas district on Friday at Jadavpur Stadium.

 Biswas, however, today denied there was any resentment among party leaders over the proposed conversion of lands. There might be some confusion among our party members on specific issues. That is why Basu and I will be meeting our partys grassroots workers in South 24-Parganas on September 9, he said.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who took the initiative for the Indonesian investment during his recent trip to Jakarta, will address a public meeting at Bhangar on September 25. State land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla, who had initially raised his voice against the move, will be present at the rally.

 Resentment has also been brewing among Left Front partners over inviting investments from abroad. 

 Biswas will reportedly begin a state-wide campaign soon to counter criticisms hurled at the Bhattacharjee government by front constituents and the Opposition Trinamul Congress.

 With elections less than a year away, the CPM is taking no chances. The party is eyeing an absolute majority, which it had lost for the first time in 2001. However, it cannot afford to ignore its partners like the RSP, the CPI and the Forward Bloc on whom it has to depend for running the government. 

 In the 294-seat House, the CPM independently won 143 seats ? five short of the target 148. Sources said the party is leaving no stone unturned to ensure the 2006 Assembly election does not see a repeat. 

 According to CPM insiders, the partners are aware of their importance in the front. They had successfully forced Bhattacharjee to withdraw the controversial Salishi bill, further boosting their confidence.

 The Jyoti Basu government did not face resistance from the partners as the Bhattacharjee government is doing because we had absolute majority in the Assembly during Basus tenure, said a senior CPM leader.

 Biswas, the CPM state secretary, said the party would work hard to regain its lost glory. But in doing so, we will never undermine our partners.

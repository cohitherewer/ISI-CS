 Shalishi shield after rape

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Lalgola, May 8: A 15-year-old girl, who conceived after being allegedly forced into a relationship by the son of a CPM supporter in whose house she worked, has been running pillar to post for his punishment, but without result.

 Rahela Khatun (name changed) has written to the Lalgola police station as well as Lalbagh subdivisional officer Abanindranath Singh, accusing Safiqul Khan of raping her when she worked as a help in his house at Pathanpara in Lalgola, Murshidabad, 250 km from Calcutta. 

 The administration has shown no interest in arresting the son of Faizuddin Khan, a wealthy CPM backer, and party leaders offered money to the girls father to settle the issue. ?Me and my father were called to a conciliation meeting at the party office. Asked to name the person who got me pregnant, I identified Safiqul. They offered me Rs 15,000 as my arrears and Rs 3,000 as abortion expenses. We refused the deal.?

 Rahela started working in the Khan household five years ago, but she said she did not receive any money as her employers promised to pay the dues at ?the time of my marriage?. 

 She was then forced into the relationship by Safiqul, who promised marriage. 

 When she became pregnant, Nazir Hossain, a local CPM leader, and Krishna Roy Chatterjee, a member of the Lalgola zonal committee, called the shalishi (conciliation) meeting.

 The money her father had refused, but he could not turn down the proposal of his daughters marriage to another man which the leaders promised to arrange. Rahela married Tutul Sheikh of Ramnagar, who was given Rs 8,000 and a bicycle, but not told that she was carrying. 

 Tutul got upset when her pregnancy became apparent and gave her an instant talaaq. Rahela is now five months pregnant.

 Sinha said he had asked the subdivisional police officer to probe the incident, but has ?not heard from him yet?. Jagabandhu Mondal, the Lalgola OC, said he ?tried for a settlement?, but failed. ?I will send a report to Sinha soon.?

 Vacate notice on track slums 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 12: The Eastern Railways today served notices on nearly 4,000 squatters asking them to leave the shanties along the 3-km railway track between Ballygunge and Tollygunge by February 28.

 Undeterred by the notices, the settlers today decided to file a fresh petition on Monday before the Supreme Court to get a stay order on the eviction.

 The notices, incorporating a copy of the order of Calcutta High Court on the proposed eviction, were pasted on different places of the slum area during the day.

 According to the high court ruling, settlers who leave the place on their own within the stipulated period (February 28) will be awarded certificates by the railway authorities. The certificates, officials said, will enable 3,874 settlers to get priority when the state or the Centre decides to provide them alternative shelters or accommodation under the Valmiki Ambedkar Abasan Yojana, a centrally sponsored scheme.

 The settlers, who do not quit the place by February 28, will have to face eviction, which will be jointly carried out by the railways, state government, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation. CESC will snap the power supply lines to the shanties.

 The Eastern Railways decided to issue notices after the Supreme Court declined to order a stay on the eviction. Ekta, an organisation of the squatters, while moving a petition before the apex court on February 7 demanding alternative shelters, had requested for a stay order. But the judges declined and fixed the hearing on the alternative shelter issue after six months.

 The Trinamul Congress has decided to organise a sit-in on February 15 in front of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s residence to protest the proposed eviction.

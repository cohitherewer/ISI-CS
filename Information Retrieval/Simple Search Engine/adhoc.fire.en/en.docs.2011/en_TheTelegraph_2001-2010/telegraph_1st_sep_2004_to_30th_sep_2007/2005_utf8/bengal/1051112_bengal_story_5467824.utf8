 Citu vents anger on boss, again 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Nov. 11: Workers owing allegiance to Citu gheraoed the general manager of a sponge iron factory at Mejia in Bankura for hours yesterday, ransacked his office and ass- aulted two security guards.

 The workers, who were on contract, have stopped unloading raw materials and loading products at the plant, about 250 km from Calcutta.

 On Sunday, Citu workers had beaten up the general manager of Rishabh Sponge Iron at Barjora, about 30 km from Mejia, and his deputy. Both had to be hospitalised. 

 At Mejia, Citu supporters waving red flags yesterday laid siege to Divya Jyoti Sponge Iron from dawn to dusk demanding a wage hike. Personnel from Mejia police station rescued Rajiv Das, the general manager, in the evening. 

 Sunil Jain, the plants director, has lodged a complaint with police and sought intervention of the state administration and senior Citu leaders. 

 District Citu secretary Kinkar Prasad, who had yester-day said that supporters would be taught to be well mannered while dealing with management, today said the vandals at Mejia would not be spared.

 Jain said: We have 70 con-tract workers who are all paid Rs 72 a day. The amount was agreed upon in September, but now they want Rs 85 a day.

 Buddha sermon and salute to police

 Buddhadeb: Pep talk

 Calcutta, March 5: A friend of the common man but a terror for criminals, that is the task Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has cut out for his cops. 

 Addressing a combined parade of West Bengal and Calcutta police at the Brigade Parade Grounds today, the chief minister, who also holds the home portfolio, urged the police to go after law-breakers, regardless of their political affiliation. 

 ?I know that there are different kinds of criminals trying to raise their ugly heads, but you must not allow them to go scot-free. Arrest them irrespective of their party affiliations. Don?t spare them even if they belong to the ruling party,? he said. 

 Bhattacharjee repeated his appeal to extremist outfits to give up arms and join the mainstream. But in the same breath, he urged the police not to be complacent while dealing with insurgency. 

 ?Extremist forces are still active in Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia in south Bengal and some districts in north Bengal. We are calling upon them to surrender?. The state government will pro- vide all the necessary help once they give up arms. We shall take steps for their rehabilitation if they shun violence.? 

 But ?you have to contain violence unleashed by extremists at any cost?, the chief minister told the assembled policemen. 

 ?You have to be friends of common people but terror to the criminals.?

 A week ago, Bhattacharjee himself conceded that the city, earlier an ?oasis? of peace, had had become a shelter for criminals running extortion rackets. 

 It was not only tough talk, however. The chief minister also praised the state police for ?doing a good job despite serious limitations.? 

 ?There are more than 8 crore people in the state. But we have only 60,000 police personnel to look after law and order. Even then, they are doing a tremendous job of giving the criminals a tough time.? 

 Bhattacharjee also repeated the state?s commitment to provide accommodation to the policemen. 

 ?Many of them do not have houses. This is not fair. We are trying to construct housing complexes for them,? he said.

 The parade was also attended by governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi who gave away the President?s police medal for distinguished service to 11 policemen. 

 Sixteen others received police medals for meritorious service.

 Gimme more, goes Ghisingh

 Siliguri, July 3: Having successfully negotiated the special status demand for the Darjeeling hills, Subash Ghisingh is bracing for a fresh battle with the state.

 He wants more than just the hills under his wings and the call for a fresh demarcation of areas to be included under the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) is likely to be a bone of contention between never-happy Ghisingh and the ever-weary government.

 The Sixth Schedule issue has been settled after both the governments (the Centre and the state) agreed to our demand. Now, the matter of area will have to be discussed with the state government, the Gorkha leader said on his arrival at Bagdogra airport today.

 The Centre has no objection to the fresh demarcation, he claimed. Even if Dooars or Jalpaiguri is included in the DGHC, the Centre has no problem? We will now discuss the matter with Calcutta at the political level. 

 When pointed out that the state government had ruled out any fresh demarcation of territory, Ghisingh said: I cant comment when the matter is yet to be discussed. 

 About a month ago, he had first talked about including the entire Darjeeling district under the DGHC. In a letter to Ram Surat Singh, the National Commission for Backward Classes chief, on June 1, Ghisingh had demanded that Darjeeling district be given Sixth Schedule status. 

 Today, he avoided a direct answer to the question of tribal status for the hill inhabitants. You read the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, he said. The Sixth Schedule is applicable for tribal-majority areas.

 Ghisingh admitted that it would take some time before a mechanism is evolved for the imposition of the status.

 He refused to answer to queries on the DGHC elections, his condition for which was the special status for the hills. I did not go to Delhi to discuss that (the elections), an otherwise jovial Ghisingh said with a touch of irritation.

 The GNLF leader was greeted with bouquets and khada (scarf) by a motley group of supporters at the airport. Visibly happy, he obliged reporters by speaking to them twice over after some complained that they could not hear him clearly.

 Taking a cue from the leader, the GNLFs Terai unit was the first to also demand the inclusion of Naxalbari in the council. Its president said: It has always been our demand.

 Govt nod for HS exam on Class XII syllabi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 burden to ease

 Calcutta, July 20: The state government has cleared a proposal that seeks to limit higher secondary examination to the syllabi of only Class XII.

 Once the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education ratifies the plan, the government will notify the change.

 Under the present system, the higher secondary examination covers the syllabi of both classes XI and XII. The proposed recast will not only reduce the stress on students but also speed up the publication of results. 

 The Supreme Court had recently ruled that the results of the Class XII examinations should be announced latest by June 10 every year and marksheets distributed by June 15.

 Till last year, the Bengal council published the higher secondary results later than most other boards.

 If the examination is held only on the basis of Class XII syllabi ? now tests for both classes are held together by the end of the second year ? it will sharply reduce the number of answer scripts. This will enable the council to speed up the process of publishing the results.

 School education minister Kanti Biswas held a meeting today with teachers bodies and officials of school boards and the education department to hear their final opinion on splitting the higher secondary syllabi. 

 Representatives of all the teachers bodies who met us today have agreed to hold the higher secondary examinations only on the basis of Class XII syllabi, Biswas said after the meeting.

 We have now referred the matter to the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education. The council will place the proposal before its executive committee as early as possible for ratification after which the government will be able to make the official notification, Biswas added.

 The minister had told the Assembly last week that the final decision would be taken this month.

 Students who will appear for the higher secondary examinations in 2007 will become the first batch under the new system. There are over 6,000 higher secondary schools across the state.

 Council officials said a revamp would be required to implement the new system.

 For instance, we need to increase the number of teaching days in Class XII, said Amiya Basu, the leader of a teachers body associated with the CPI. 

 Under the existing system, not more than 120 to 135 teaching days can be offered in classes XI and XII. But a degree of flexibility was there as unfinished work could be carried over to the next year. 

 We must have a minimum of 180 teaching days in both Class XI and Class XII if we have to hold the higher secondary examinations only on the basis of Class XII, a spokesperson for another Left union said.

 The government is considering a proposal to begin the higher secondary academic session from May 1, replacing the existing system under which the session starts from June 1.

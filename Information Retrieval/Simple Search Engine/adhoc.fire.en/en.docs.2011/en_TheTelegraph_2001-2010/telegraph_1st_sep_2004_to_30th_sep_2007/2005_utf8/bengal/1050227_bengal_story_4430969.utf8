 Hi-tech hostels top IIT to-do list

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 Kharagpur, Feb. 26: Rising budgets, hi-tech hostels and global goals dominated the golden jubilee convocation of the oldest Indian Institute of Technology in the country this afternoon.

 As the latest batch of graduates at IIT Kharagpur received citations and medals, Sanjiv Goenka, the chairman of the board of governors, and Shishir Kumar Dube, the director of IIT Kharagpur, unveiled a flurry of new plans and projects.

 Topping the to-do list are state-of-the-art hostels for both men and women. ?Hostels have traditionally been designed in our country based on a spartan philosophy of sacrifice. We wish to break away from the pattern,? said Goenka. The proposed 800-room men?s hostel and 250-room women?s hostel are supposed to have all modern facilities, including computer-friendly measures like a Wi-Fi system. ?The hostels will be comfortable, but not plush,? said Goenka.

 A 2,000-seater auditorium is also to be constructed by Durga Puja 2005.

 Big plans call for bid budgets and the spending for the next financial year spending is being pitched at Rs 80 crore, as opposed to Rs 35 crore last year. The institute has earmarked Rs 130-140 crore for research and development over the next two years.

 ?We also intend to pursue mentoring good ideas for research coming from faculty members. The institute will fund the research till it is ready for commercial implementation,? said Dube.

 Other major projects include a greenhouse for cultivating medicinal plants in five villages around Kharagpur. A 15-acre tea garden has been created with funds from the department of science. The green tea produce has been registered with the Tea Board. In all, the institute has filed 37 patents and copyright applications, domestic and international, during the year.

 ?Technologies developed here are increasingly becoming commercially relevant as indicated by the growing number of requests from a large number of companies in a variety of areas,? said Dube.

 Plans were also unveiled for a government of Orissa and IIT Kharagpur collaboration for research and implementation in the field of biotechnology, solid waste management, disaster management litigation and civic city planning on a turnkey basis.

 Collaborations beyond boundaries are also forthcoming. The department of agricultural and food engineering has established collaborative research with the University of Hannover, Germany. Other players from Germany, Manila and the US have also entered into research partnerships.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Feb. 6: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and finance minister Asim Dasgupta will meet Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia in Delhi tomorrow to discuss the state?s annual plan for the coming financial year. 

 Planning and development minister Nirupam Sen will also be there. This is the first time Bhattacharjee will be part of a team seeking more central assistance.

 Behrampore: Four-and-a-half-year-old Nargis Parveen was hurled into the Bhagirathi by her uncle in Murshidabad?s Raghunathgunj on Saturday for a pair of gold earrings. Police said Ebadul Sheikh, a mason who works in Calcutta, about 250 km away, has been arrested. He targeted the earrings, weighing a paltry gram-and-a-half, to raise the money he had lost in gambling.

Achinta Biswas, a teacher of Ujirpukur High School, Bimal Biswas, the chief of Bogula-II gram panchayat and the duo will be produced in the Ranaghat subdivisional court on Monday.

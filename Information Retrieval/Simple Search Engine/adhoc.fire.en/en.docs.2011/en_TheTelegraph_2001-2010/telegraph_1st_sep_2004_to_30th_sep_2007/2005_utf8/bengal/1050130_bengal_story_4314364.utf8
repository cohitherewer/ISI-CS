 Howrah wakes up to heritage

 The Town Hall: Time to put things in place

 Howrah, Jan. 29: Wiser after the collapse of the century-old Town Hall last January, the Howrah Municipal Corporation has lined up a string of measures to preserve heritage structures in the seemingly unplanned township on the bank of the Hooghly.

 ?After the cave-in, it is our prime concern to look after buildings with ancient and historical values,? said mayor Gopal Mukherjee.

 A committee constituted by the civic body in 1998-?99 had identified nine buildings as heritage structures, including the district magistrate?s bungalow, the Town Hall and the railway station complex. 

 As a first step, the corporation has drawn up a list of experts who would identify other buildings that need to be brought under the preservation umbrella. 

 Basudev Banerjee, the corporation?s chief architect, said: ?The objective is to facilitate the civic body to identify the buildings in Howrah that demand preservation considering their architectural and heritage values.? 

 ?Besides, the experts would speak to the owners about the background of the buildings and suggest ways to maintain them.?

 Civic officials said the team would comprise an architect registered with the Council of Architecture and post-graduate degree holders experienced in conservation and preservation of old buildings along with an experienced structural engineer. A historian of repute will head the team.

 The heritage committee is virtually headless since historian Nemai Sadhan Bose, the chairman of the panel for over five years, died last August. Mukherjee said a search is on for Bose?s successor. He added: ?We?ve issued notifications so that the expert panel can be formed as early as possible.?

 The corporation has decided to begin renovation of the Town Hall at an estimated cost of Rs 80 lakh. ?We are confident about restoring it to its past glory,? said Mukherjee.

 Mother?s prayers answered

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 5: Soon after Roma Jhawar returned home, Pushpa Devi dragged her to the marble-laid corner of the drawing room where idols of the family deities are neatly arranged. Mother and daughter bowed in reverence and touched the idols.

 For Pushpa Devi, her night-long prayers had been answered. Through the night, family insiders claimed, she would not move from her gods. She sat in front of the idols and prayed in silence, her eyes fixed on them. Only after some persuasion would she drink some water, at times.

 Family members moved in and out while others spent time with the officers who had been asked to stay put inside. 

 But Pushpa Devi was never distracted. ?We couldn?t even ask her to move. No one would dare bother her as she went on with her prayers,? said a family member.

 When the good news came, Pushpa Devi folded her hands in gratitude in front of the gods. ?Our Guruji had said she (Roma) would return and we are happy that our prayers have been answered,? said Roma?s uncle.

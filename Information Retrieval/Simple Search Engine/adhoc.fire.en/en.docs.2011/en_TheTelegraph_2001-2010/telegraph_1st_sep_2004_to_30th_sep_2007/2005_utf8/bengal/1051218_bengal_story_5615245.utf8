 Student duo in suicide bid

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 17: Two 

 Class XI students attempted suicide together on the compound 

 of the Majdia Co-Educational High School in Nadia today 

 after the headmaster and teachers scolded them for failing 

 in their final examination.

 Abhijit Sarkar and Sashwati Basu were also told that their parents would be summoned tomorrow to discuss the results of the examination announced today.

 After they heard about the decision of the school authorities, both of them went to a field behind the school building around 1.30 this afternoon and took sleeping pills.

 Our security guard spotted the two writhing in pain. We immediately took them to the Krishnagunj hospital where the girl is still admitted, said Manoj Biswas, the headmaster of the school, about 110 km from Calcutta.

 The two will be interrogated after they are declared fit, Biswas said. The incident has tarnished the image of our institution as such an incident has never happened in its 50-year history.

 Asked if the school authorities would take any action against the duo, he said: We have decided to rusticate the students for their misconduct.

 A managing committee meeting has been convened on Monday.

 Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajshekharan said they were investigating if the students had an affair. The police would interrogate the duo, he added.

 While the boys parents are still unable to come to terms with the incident, the girls father, lodged a complaint against Abhijit with the Krishnagunj police station alleging that he had incited her to attempt suicide.

 CPM in Salt Lake reachout

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 10: The CPM leadership has issued a whip on party workers in Salt Lake asking them to meet every non-Bengali voter in the township without fail.

 Some of our party workers say there is no point visiting the non-Bengali voters as they dont vote for us. This is a wrong assumption. You have to eschew any such prejudice and meet each voter in Salt Lake. You have to complete the job as early as possible, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas warned recalcitrant party workers at a gathering on Wednesday.

 In the township of 1.3 lakh people, around 99,000 have the right to vote. Of them, about 35,000 are non-Bengalis. 

 Biswas made it clear to party workers at a general body meeting in Salt Lake last month that the CPM could not ignore the large non-Bengali population. 

 The state CPM leaders came to know about the reluctance among cadre to campaign among non-Bengali speaking people when some members of the partys North 24-Parganas district committee and a CPM MP met Jyoti Basu at his Salt Lake residence to discuss preparations for the June 19 elections.

 The BJP was perceived to cut more teeth into a substantial number of non-Bengali people, but the party has fielded only three candidates as part of an understanding with Mamata Banerjee. 

 Observers said polices role in rescuing the kidnapped Roma Jhawar, a Salt Lake resident, has given the CPM an added boost. The cadre have been asked to refer to it during door-to-door campaigns. 

 Industrialists like Arun Poddar, Kamal Gandhi, Bharat Jain and others, who attended a face-to-face with Basu at Nalban before the Lok Sabha elections, are among those who have offered a helping hand to the CPM in moulding the non-Bengali population in its favour. 

 During campaign, the CPM workers are projecting Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as an industry-friendly chief minister. 

 Basu will himself kick-off a round of serious campaigning with a public meeting at Salt Lake stadium on Sunday. 

 Basu is your next-door neighbour and he will address you on Sunday, party workers were heard telling the residents. 

 In its manifesto for the Salt Lake polls, the CPM has promised electricity to the added areas of Mahishbathan and Ajoynagar. It has also pledged drinking water supply from Palta and Tullah by setting up a pumping station in Salt Lake. 

 The CPM now has 12 out of 23 wards of Bidhannagar municipality. The party wants 20. One of its prime targets is a former comrade, Radhika Ranjan Pramanik, Trinamuls candidate for chairperson. 

 A former CPM MLA and MP, Pramanik joined Trinamul before the Lok Sabha polls. He contested from home turf Mathurapur, in South 24-Parganas, on a Trinamul ticket, but lost to the CPM.

 Dual stand salvo at Left

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 8: The Congress today accused Left parties of adopting differing stands in Delhi and Bengal, but defended the relationship at the Centre.

 Congress leader Salman Khursheed said there is a vast difference between what Left parties do in Delhi and Bengal at a panel discussion on Does Coalition Politics Hinder Economic Development. But he pointed out that ?getting into a coalition is like a form of necessity, like a marriage, and you must make corrections in it if you want to make it work?. 

 ?Coalitions play their own role in getting larger points of view and less means for people to feel alienated,? the Congress leader said at the discussion organised in the city by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce.

 Nilotpal Basu of the CPM and Jagdish Shettigar of the BJP also took part in the discussion, which covered various aspects of coalition politics and its impact on economic development.

 Democracy is taken too much for granted and if coalitions turn out to be just stepping stones to power, it would destroy economic development and democracy, said Khursheed.

 ?Each country has its specific history and path of economic development and so on. All these have to be taken together to chart out the course of economic development that is the best for us. It is also important to note the fundamental difference between economic growth and economic development,? said Basu, a Rajya Sabha MP.

 If coalition politics is here to stay, it must be time to note how to make it work for people?s good. 

 This formed a large part of today?s panel discussion on ?Does coalition politics hinder economic development?? organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce in the city. Congress? Salman Khurshid, CPM?s Nilotpal Basu and BJP?s Jagdish Shettigar discussed various aspects of coalition politics and its impact on economic development across the country.

 Democracy is taken too much for granted, and if coalitions turn out to be just stepping stones to power, it would destroy economic development and democracy, said Salman Khurshid, president of the Uttar Pradesh Committee of Congress. He added: ?Getting into coalition is like a form of necessity, like a marriage, and you must make the necessary corrections in it if you want to make it work?.? 

 He said there is a vast difference between what the Left Front does in Delhi, and what it does in Bengal. ?Coalitions play their own role in getting larger points of view and less means for people to feel alienated?.

 Khurshid said: ?We haven?t yet reached a stable thinking on coalition?? 

 Quoting ?friend? Jairam Ramesh, he said: ?Your point of view is not where you stand, but where you sit in Parliament?. 

 Nilotpal Basu, CPM MP of Rajya Sabha said that the issue to address must be how good a coalition can be in India. ?Each country has its specific history, path of economic development and so on? all these taken together, will have to chart out its own course of economic development and what should be the best for us. Also, it is important to note the fundamental difference between economic growth and economic development.? 

 Any system, he felt, should ultimately be democratic and sustainable by the people, and this holds good for any idea and economic reform. ?Reforms, changes, and modifications are essential feature of life? we cannot shut ourselves from the entire civilisation. But unless the change benefits the majority, it cannot sustain?? he added.

 ?The fundamental question is how coalition can best address the problems of the country ? with the kind of diversities we have in India?,? Basu said.

 Meanwhile, answering a question, he mentioned that despite the notion of developing trade relations with the East, there is lack of infrastructure such as direct air links of the state with trade centres in these areas, and which must be improved.

 Jagdish Shettigar, convenor, economic affairs committee, BJP said that coalition itself doesn?t hinder development, but appropriate policy decision is crucial and so is determination to understand and help promote development.

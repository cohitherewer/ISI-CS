 Sibal?s green concern

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 20: Union science and technology minister Kapil Sibal today criticised governments for failing to adopt environment-friendly means to harness natural resources.

 Addressing the All India People?s Technology Congress at Science City, Sibal said: ?It is unfortunate that since 1947, we have failed to make a national databank on water resources, or management policies for the purpose. There must be a map using global information system so that we can identify which areas are rich and which areas deficit in water resources.? 

 He reminded the audience of the looming drinking water crisis saying: ?Within a span of a few decades, there might be a world war over water.?

 Sibal also said despite the Green Revolution, 40 per cent of seeds sold to farmers are spurious. ?Farmers have no access to market or technology. So we need a biotech policy.?

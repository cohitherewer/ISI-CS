 Dhaba assault 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 15: Multiple fractures have been found in the head of one of the youths beaten up at a dhaba on Ballygunge Circular Road on Wednesday night.

 Three of the six youths, who were out pandal-hopping, were seriously injured when they got into an altercation over their food bill. The dhaba employees hit Ajay Mehra on the head with an iron rod. 

 Doctors have now detected multiple fractures in Ajays head and have advised rest for the next three months. They did not rule out a life-threatening surgery. Ajay may have to undergo a surgery on his brain which is always life-threatening. But, at this stage, he is responding to our treatment gradually and should be fine if there is no infection, Utpal Dutta Gupta, the doctor treating Ajay, said. 

 We are worried after going through the CT scan report, S.K. Mehra, Ajays father, said.

 Souvik, another injured, could not leave his bed even after three days.

 Lalan Singh, the dhaba owner, and the employees were arrested on the charge of attempted murder. The trio was remanded in police custody till October 18.

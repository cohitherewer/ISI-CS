 Long-term plan for growth

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 Calcutta, July 9: The Bengal government needs a long-term plan to meet the twin objectives of sustaining present growth rates and graduating to a higher trajectory in the next phase.

 The city-based industry association, the Indian Chamber of Commerce, has tabled a list of suggestions for meeting these objectives at a closed-door meeting with industries and commerce minister Nirupam Sen.

 The crux of the chambers recommendation is a policy document that looks beyond infrastructure and labour relations and dovetails future initiatives with it.

 The growth rate in Bengal has been phenomenal in the past few years and we think the time is right to take a long-term view and plan ahead. We have proposed the preparation of a document, Vision 2020, for the state, the chamber president, Umang Kanoria, said.

 The minister liked the idea and accepted the benefits of planning ahead, said Kanoria.

 Vision 2020 should be woven around regional co-operation, diversification of the investment basket, thrust on exports by developing brand Bengal, foreign direct investment, identification of niche areas and Calcuttas advantage as a gateway city, said the recommendations.

 Other critical elements of the plan include formulating a Look East strategy and taking advantage of free trade agreements with neighbouring countries.

 One-off visits to foreign countries will not yield results. We have to identify countries and companies and develop partnerships to derive the desired benefits, stressed Nazeeb Arif, the secretary general of the chamber.

 Arif said the state government should also project Bengal as a base for component manufacturing ? following the Taiwan model ? by leveraging the iron and steel base, Haldia Petrochemicals, IT capabilities and human resources.

 The chambers executive committee, including ITCs Anup Singh, Graphite Indias K.K. Bangur, Harsh Jha of Tata Metalics and Gaurav Swarup of Paharpur Cooling Towers, lauded the measures that had resulted in more than Rs 2,000 crore annual investments coming into the state. However, they all agreed that Bengal needs to step up a gear to scale up the next round of growth.

 To kick-start the process, the chamber has volunteered to prepare a draft document. The government can then involve other stakeholders in discussions and debates and finalise a long-term plan, said Kanoria.

 Buddha plans hill council shape with PM

 ALOKE TIKKU

 New Delhi, March 19: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today finalised the structure of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) that will come into force next week when the term of the present council expires.

 The decision on the interim arrangement is learnt to have been taken at a 25-minute meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister Shivraj Patil. 

 Early this week, the Bengal Assembly had cleared an amendment to the DGHC Act to provide for a caretaker administrator or board of administrators to exercise the powers of the general council for six months but left details of this arrangement open-ended. The government had said the arrangement would be finalised in consultation with the Centre.

 Bhattacharjee, however, was unwilling to divulge the details of the structure and said the announcement would be made later, presumably after he consults the CPM politburo that is meeting in Delhi.

 National security adviser M.K. Narayanan said the chief minister had explained his position to Singh and has been asked to ensure that peace in the region is not disturbed.

 Council chairman Subhas Ghisingh had demanded that he be appointed its caretaker after expiry of its term on March 25. 

 The state government has not ruled out this possibility so far. Rather, it is believed to have signalled to Ghisingh that he would have a role to play in the interim set-up. 

 This is said to have prompted the GNLF leader to declare recently that the government had cleared his appointment as administrator of the council.

 Sources said appointing the GNLF chief administrator was one of the three options discussed within the party and the government, and with Singh. According to this option, Ghisingh could be made the administrator but with a board that would need to be consulted. The second option under consideration was that an apolitical person ? a bureaucrat ? be appointed administrator. The third option was the appointment of a board that will be made up of representatives of political parties.

 It has been suggested that the government draft an amendment to the DGHC bill passed on March 14 to leave the door open for these options.

 Bhattacharjee said he thanked the Prime Minister for the UPA government?s decision to set up a National Institute of Science in Calcutta, along with one in Hyderabad. The chief minister also presented a cheque of Rs 1.5 crore to the Prime Minister?s Relief Fund for Tsunami Relief.

 Security order

 State urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said in Siliguri today that he had asked police to beef up security in the hills, anticipating a law and order problem in the run-up to the DGHC polls.

 Accusing the GNLF of threatening Opposition parties, Bhattacharya said the police administration has been asked to be more cautious. ?Given the fact that the GNLF has already started to threaten Opposition parties, we expect the law and order situation to deteriorate,? he said.

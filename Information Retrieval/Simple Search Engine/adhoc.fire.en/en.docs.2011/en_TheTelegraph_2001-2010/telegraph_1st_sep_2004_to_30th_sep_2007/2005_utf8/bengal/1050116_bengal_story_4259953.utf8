 Sleuths firm on suspect 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Jan. 15: Amid protests from a section of the Indian Museum staff over the arrest of a senior technical assistant, police detectives today claimed Satyakam Sen?s fingerprints were found at a spot that had to pressed to open the glass case in which the stolen Buddha head was kept. 

 Sen was arrested yesterday, 16 days after the Buddha head, a classic from the mid-Gupta age and dating back to the 5th century, was stolen. Sen maintains he was not involved, but the police claimed clues told another story. 

 ?His fingerprint was found among four others from a very crucial place on the glass case and it?s not a dated print. The forensic experts have said so. Besides, we have had his fingerprints verified from several agencies. It?s disturbing... Sen is denying that he had ever touched the glass case. Why should he deny the fact?? wondered detective department chief Peeyush Pandey. 

 Sleuths probing the case claim that on the day of the incident, Sen had left his office for over an hour and didn?t go to the eatery where he usually had his lunch. Sen has claimed that he left for only 15 minutes. 

 ?The circumstantial evidence is strong enough to justify our claim against the officer. We hope he would throw up some clue for us to trace the statue. But as of now, he is still to open up,? Pandey said. 

 The arrest has not gone down well with the museum staff, who refuse to believe the man associated with the museum since 1992 could be involved. Soon after Sen was detained, a section of the staff went on a protest, forcing the authorities to close the museum till 3 pm yesterday. Director Shakti Kali Basu went to Lalbazar to follow up on the arrest. 

 ?I went to inquire why he was being detained for so long. It is very hard to believe. We just hope that things are finally settled,? Basu said. 

 Terming Sen as a ?tough nut?, officers said he would not speak about the theft. ?If required, we might even consult a psychiatrist to make out if he is trying to take us for a ride,? Pandey said.

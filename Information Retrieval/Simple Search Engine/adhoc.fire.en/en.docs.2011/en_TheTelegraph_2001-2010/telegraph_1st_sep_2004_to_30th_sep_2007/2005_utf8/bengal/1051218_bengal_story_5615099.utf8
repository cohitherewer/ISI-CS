 Swiss Park assault

 Calcutta, Dec. 17: A man who beat up a Swiss Park resident and his 80-year-old father on Wednesday evening was granted bail today, says a staff reporter. 

 Avijeet Chatterjee, 34, and his father had protested against the parking of cars from Janak Roys motor training school on the common road in front of their house. 

 Roy, along with his three sons and 15 others, thrashed the 34-year-old Avijeet before barging into his house and battering his father. They left an hour later with Rs 6,000 in cash, a Hamilton watch and a Mont Blanc pen.

 BSF fire stops intruders

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 21: The Border Security Force last night fired eight rounds at four Bangladeshis trying to cross the Mathabhanga river into India at the Sikarpur border.

 Three of them dived into the river and fled, while one drowned on being hit by bullets at the outpost in the Murutia police station area, around 200 km from Calcutta.

 Border guards patrolling the bank of Mathabhanga saw the four around 10 last night and asked them to stop. But they paid no heed, said an officer of the 94 battalion.

 Our soldiers had no choice but to open fire. One man was hit by the bullets and drowned in the river, he said.

 When the news was conveyed to Bangladesh Rifles officials, they called for a flag meeting. We held the flag meeting this morning. The BDR admitted that the intruders were Bangladeshis. We then decided to launch a joint search for the missing men, said Naimuddin Khan, sector commandant, BSF, Krishnagar.

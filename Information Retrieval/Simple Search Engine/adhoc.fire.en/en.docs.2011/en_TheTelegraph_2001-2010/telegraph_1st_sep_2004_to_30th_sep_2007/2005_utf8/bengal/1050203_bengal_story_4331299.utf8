 Ghisingh returns, mellow

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bagdogra Airport, Feb. 2: DGHC chairman Subash Ghisingh today stepped into his lair after two rounds of talks in New Delhi, but missing was the adamant stance that the hill issues would have to be resolved before the council polls. 

 Though Ghisingh did not clearly mention that the overdue elections could be held before the present term expires on March 25, his words and body language indicated a softening of the attitude he had before leaving for Delhi. 

 ?March 26 is quite far off. I will be discussing the election issue with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in the next couple of days,? he said.

 The CPM and the state government, citing legal wrangles, have categorically maintained the hill council polls would be held before the council?s extended term expires. 

 Ghisingh sounded bitter about Bhattacharjee?s absence from the Delhi meet.

 ?He should have attended the crucial meet. I expected him there,? he said. ?It is unfortunate that a meeting among political heads degenerated into a secretary-level exchange.? 

 He warned ?the next level of talks will have to be between the political heads?. 

 The state government has, however, shot down five proposals of the council. 

 The demands were control over the police in Darjeeling, forming a scheduled caste and scheduled tribe corporation and DGHC control over the block development officers.

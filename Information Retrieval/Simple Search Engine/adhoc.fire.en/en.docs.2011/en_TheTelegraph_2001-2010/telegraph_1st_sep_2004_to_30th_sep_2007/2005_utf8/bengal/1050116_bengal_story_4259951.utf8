 Tales of bravery tinged with tears

 Calcutta, Jan. 15: Atanu Maity blazed a trail of glory ? literally. The soldier from Bengal and his comrades battled militants in the north of Kashmir on a cold December night

 When the dust had settled, Maity had killed one militant. But he was dead, too. Maity had refused to leave the battlefield despite being severely injured.

 Maity and six others ? two from the state ? were posthumously awarded the Sena Medal for gallantry by Lt General Arvind Sharma, the general officer commanding-in-chief of Eastern Command, during an investiture ceremony at Fort William today. 

 ?I felt proud and at the same time sad,? said Soma, Maity?s widow. They had been married for four years. ?I felt proud my husband was in the army,? she said, unable to hold back her tears. 

 Life had seemed meaningless when Maity?s body was brought back to their Batanagar residence in December 2003. Soma now lives with his memory and their two-year-old son, Soumyadeep, who begins school next year. 

 ?I would like him to go to the army like his father but I cannot stay alone without him,? she said. 

 However, Aparna, the widow of Swapan Bera who was killed in the northeast, wants toddler son Ayan to join the army.

 Bera was leading a search patrol when they were fired upon by militants. In a story similar to that of Maity, Bera ignored the bullet injuries he received to do battle, shoulder to shoulder with his mates. He gunned down a militant, but was killed that same night. 

 The family is proud of Bera?s sacrifice, but bitter at the apathy of the state. ?When his body was brought back, no one from the district administration had the courtesy to pay their respects,? said father Sukumar. 

 ?There has been no help from the state government though we wrote to the chief minister,? said Aparna. The hopes of the family from Rajhati village in Tamluk of East Midnapore now rest on Ayan. 

 For Pintu Ghosh?s parents, the day was a blend of pride and sorrow. After seven years in the army, on August 10, 2003, their son pursued a militant in Doda. The rebel hid behind some rocks and shot at his tormentor. Ghosh was hit but did not flinch till he had his quarry. He died even as a match was being arranged for him. 

 ?I am a poor farmer and never thought my son will bring so much honour to our family,? said Radheshyam, who had accompanied wife Mamata from the Burdwan village to receive the medal. ?His marriage was fixed and then everything went haywire. His mother now hardly speaks and seldom goes out.? 

 The other posthumous awardees were Ram Dhan Boro, Jai Singh Boro and Rajesh Gurung. 

 Captain Arindam Ghosh of Liluah was also honoured. On December 9, 2003, Ghosh and his team attacked a militant base near the Indo-Bhutan border in Assam?s Kamrup district. ?We had information that militants were escaping by using this route during Operation Flushout (in Bhutan),? Ghosh said. Two rebels died in the confrontation. 

 In all, one Yudh Seva Medal, 34 Sena Medals for gallantry, five Sena Medals for distinguished service, eight Vishisht Seva Medals and another Vishisht Seva Medal (Bar ? for a soldier who had won it earlier, too) were given out. 

 Speaking at the occasion, Lt Gen. Sharma said the Kamptapur Liberation Organisation and other militant outfits operating in the Northeast have been brought under control. 

 Referring to the issue of Bangladesh providing shelter to militants, Sharma said: ?It will be taken up at the diplomatic level of the two countries.?

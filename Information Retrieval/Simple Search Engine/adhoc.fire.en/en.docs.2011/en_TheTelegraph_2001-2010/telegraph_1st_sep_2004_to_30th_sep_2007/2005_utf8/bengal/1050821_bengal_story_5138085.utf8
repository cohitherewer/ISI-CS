 Pranab hints at Adhir ouster

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Aug. 20: Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee today indicated that Murshidabad Congress president Adhir Chowdhury and several other district party chiefs across Bengal would be replaced by September 16.

 All our district party units will get new team leaders by the middle of next month, Mukherjee, who was re-appointed state Congress president, said here today. He was on a two-day visit to the district to attend a string of programmes, including two party workers conventions.

 Mukherjees announcement comes as a boost to Congress workers opposed to Chowdhury, who is also the MP from Behrampore. Chowdhurys detractors hold him responsible for the infighting in the party and have been demanding his removal from the key post.

 The Congress leader did not name Chowdhury, but told a party workers convention at Khargram that if somebody thinks that he can run the party according to his whims, then he is making a great blunder. A party cannot be run on the whims of an individual. A leader at the helm should realise that its a team, he said.

 Mukherjee flared up when party workers insisted that he should have named the person responsible for the infighting. 

 The state Congress president admitted that the party had lost the Dhulian and Jiagunge municipalities to the CPM in the May polls because of internal squabbles.

 Moreover, Chowdhury had put up some of his close associates as candidates for the Kandi municipality against official party nominees, much to Mukherjees displeasure. An angry Mukherjee did not campaign in Kandi.

 That a parallel organisation is running in the district was evident with those loyal to Chowdhury staying away from the programme in which the state party chief was felicitated. Siddika Begam, the sabhadhipati of Murshidabad Zilla Parishad, was conspicuous by her absence from the function.

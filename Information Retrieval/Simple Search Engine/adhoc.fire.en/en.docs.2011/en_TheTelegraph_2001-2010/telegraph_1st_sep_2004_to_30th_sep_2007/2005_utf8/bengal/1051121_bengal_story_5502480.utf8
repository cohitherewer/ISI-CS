 Split-fixers get legal call

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Nov. 20: A residents association of a Durgapur neighbourhood, which counselled warring couples, has been asked by the Burdwan administration to help those seeking court intervention for a split following the astounding success of their endeavour.

 Set up in the early 1950s, when two steel plants ? Durgapur and Alloy ? came up and the town began to develop, the association initially handled civic problems like roads, drainage, and drinking water. 

 As the population began to increase, we found that many families were plagued by marital discord. We intervened in many cases and found a little counselling could settle a lot of disputes. We solved nearly 60 cases over the past three years, said Kabi Ghosh, the secretary of the association.

 District magistrate Subrata Gupta said Bidhannagar Residents Association has been asked to speak to husbands and wives who have lodged complaints with police or the administration. Over 7,000 divorce and maintenance cases are pending in the district court. 

 Counselling can iron out many of the problems. We were looking for good counsellors. The residents association had been doing a good job. So we decided to give them the responsibility, said Gupta.

 This July, Manab Tiwari of Bidhannagar, 200 km from Calcutta, was supposed to marry a girl from Uttar Pradesh and had even taken a dowry of Rs 5 lakh. A week before the wedding, a girl, Swapna (all names changed), arrived from Bangalore where Manab worked as a human resource development officer and claimed that they had been living together for two years. 

 Swapna came to us. We called a meeting and spoke to them. Manab agreed to marry her and return the dowry to the other family, said Ghosh.

 He cited another instance where the association brokered a settlement between Dipak Das, a Durgapur Steel Plant employee, and his wife, who led a happy life for a year until the husband felt that his wifes grey eyes were a bad omen. 

 Seven lawyers and 11 women from Bidhannagar and outside are now lending a hand to the association.

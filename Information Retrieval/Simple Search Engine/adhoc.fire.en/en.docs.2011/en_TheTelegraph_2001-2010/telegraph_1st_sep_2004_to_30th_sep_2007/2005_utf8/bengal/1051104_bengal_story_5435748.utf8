 Festival in jail for CPM duo

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Balurghat, Nov. 3: A day after being sent to jail by the court here, former CPM minister Narayan Biswas took phonta from local civic chief Sucheta Biswas and then headed to the prison hospital. 

 Biswas, who was remanded in judicial custody for a fortnight, waited in the office of jail superintendent M. Guin till a doctor cleared his stay at the hospital. 

 The man, who was minister of state for small-scale industries until he was forced to quit two days ago, has been given a bed next to party colleague Manabesh Chowdhury, who has been charged in the same case of arson as Biswas. 

 Biswas, who had complai-ned of piles, was taken to the district hospital in the prison ambulance this morning for ECG, ultra-sonography and blood tests.

 Talking to the media in the hospital, he said he faced no problems last night. 

 In fact, he added, he got up rather early in the morning, had breakfast, read newspapers and then got ready for the bhai phonta inside the jail. 

 Biswas, who embarrassed the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government by avoiding court for 16 years and refusing to surrender, accused local Trinamul Congress leader Biplab Mitra of indulging in dirty politics. He said Mitra had forced him to go to jail by implicating him in a false case. 

 But truth shall prevail and I will ultimately win, he added.

 Spending time in confinement would not be a problem, Biswas said. He will play cards and watch television.

 An NGO had organised the bhai phonta. Jails and social welfare minister Biswanath Chowdhury and several government officers were present on the occasion.

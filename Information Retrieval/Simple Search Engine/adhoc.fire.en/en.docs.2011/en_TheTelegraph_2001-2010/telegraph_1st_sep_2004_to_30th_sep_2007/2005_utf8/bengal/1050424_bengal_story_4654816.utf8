 Efficiency focus in industrial growth

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 Calcutta, April 23: Restructuring seems to be the flavour of the season in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s Bengal.

 The West Bengal Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBIIDC) is working on an action plan based on reports of consultants.

 ?We had appointed four consultants in February to evaluate our way of functioning. The draft reports have been submitted and we are planning our future course of action,? said Atri Bhattacharya, the chief executive officer of the 30-year-old state government agency.

 The plan revolves around increasing efficiency ? from streamlining revenue realisation to unlocking unutilised land and expanding the scope of business to utilising human resources effectively. At present, WBIIDC manages 13 industrial estates and is developing three new estates.

 Industrial units use facilities provided by the agency against charges, which are a major component of earnings. The other revenue components include interest income and earnings from engineering services.

 But expenditure has always outweighed income in the agency and the ends had to be met with loans from the state government.

 ?We are trying to change the situation with some measures. All the consultants ? Consulting Engineering Services, I-Win, Bengal Pragati and Bengal Shristi ? pointed out that our charges are very low. Then, some of the industrial units had stopped paying us,? said Bhattacharya, explaining the rationale for restructuring. 

 Better land utilisation ? WBIIDC has over 2,000 acres under its disposal ? is the other suggestion.

 ?Some plots in the estates are lying vacant while units on some plots have closed down. We have already started utilising unused land. Besides, we are also looking at better commercial utilisation of land,? said Bhattacharya, adding that the agency has decided to improve its services to draw more industrial units.

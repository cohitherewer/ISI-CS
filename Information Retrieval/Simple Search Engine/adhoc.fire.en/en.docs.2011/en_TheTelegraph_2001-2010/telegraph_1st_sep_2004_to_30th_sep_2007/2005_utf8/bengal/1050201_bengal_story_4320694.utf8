 Girl rape convict flees court

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 31: A 30-year-old man accused of raping a girl escaped from a packed courtroom today when the judge pronounced him guilty and was about to declare the sentence.

 Abbas Hyder alias Munna Raja, who fled from the city sessions court, could not be traced till late tonight. All police stations across the city have been alerted. 

 ?He came to the ninth fast-track court much before the case was put up before the judge for its final verdict. Well knowing that a final outcome of the five-year-old case was likely today, he stood in a corner of the room among many others,? a court official said.

 He positioned himself close to the door as the judgment was being read out and fled as soon as judge Vivek Chowdhury declared: ?Abbas Hyder has been found guilty of his crime.? 

 Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner of police, central, said Abbas was arrested for raping the girl in Jorasanko on April 21, 1999.

 A resident of the same area, he was arrested in no time. Singh said: ?He spent a few days in custody, both police and jail, but was granted bail after that.?

 An officer said: ?Today, we had no right to keep him in the court lock-up. So, he was allowed to stand in the room with others. We could have arrested him only after the verdict was pronounced.?

 Seconds after leaving the room, Abbas melted into the crowd outside the court premises. 

 ?There were policemen posted in front of the room, but Abbas fled before they realised what was happening. He did not give any chance,? said the officer.

 Since his release on bail, Abbas had been roaming the Jorasanko area free. ?The investigating officer filed the chargesheet with all the evidence required to prove his guilt,? said an officer.

 A fresh case has been registered against him at the Hare Street police station.

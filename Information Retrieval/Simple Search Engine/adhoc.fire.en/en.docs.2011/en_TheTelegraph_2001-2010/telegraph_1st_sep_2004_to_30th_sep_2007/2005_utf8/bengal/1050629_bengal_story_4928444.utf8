 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, June 28: The government today set up an academy to train judicial service and court officers.

 Officials said the State Judicial Academy will initially function from an office at Bijan Bhavan in Salt Lake. The academy has sought a 12-bigha plot at Rajarhat for its premises, judicial department sources said. There are 827 courts across the state. Better trained judicial officers, an official said, would help in the speedy disposal of cases. 

 Behrampore: A day after Laila Khatun met Murshidabad police chief Sanjay Singh to protest against an OCs refusal to accept her complaint against a youth who tried to sell her off, his mother was detained for questioning. The police raided Ujjal Miyas house at Mahisgram village on Tuesday morning.

 CU sights on July change of course

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 28: A season of change awaits honours undergraduate students set to join the 153-odd colleges affiliated to Calcutta University.

 After finalising its decision to abolish the traditional Part-I (first and second years) and Part-II (third year) structure of undergraduate courses, the university is taking steps to introduce the 1+1+1 scheme from the 2005 academic session scheduled to start in July.

 Apart from breaking the course into three parts, it will be made more student-friendly as distribution of subjects will be altered, Suranjan Das, the pro vice-chancellor, academic affairs, said today.

 For instance, for those who want to study the BA, BSc and BCom honours courses, there is a proposal to start teaching the honours papers only after the first year, that is in Part-II and Part-III, he said.

 Colleges will have to complete teaching all compulsory subjects, like language and environmental science, in the first year. 

 The proposal is aimed at improving success rates in undergraduate examinations ? many students fail to cope with the pressure of studying the honours papers along with the compulsory subjects. 

 Those without honours will also be taught the compulsory papers in the first year.

 Along with language and environmental science, students will be required to study one of the two elective subjects honours students need to study in Part-I.

 There will, however, be no change in the course content, Das added.

 With the ISC and CBSE Class XII results out and the higher secondary results due next month, varsity authorities are working overtime to ensure the scheme can be introduced this year. 

 The university has convened an emergency meeting of its undergraduate council next week to discuss how to complete the formalities of abolishing the old system as early as possible.

 CU had set up a committee last month to examine the basic requirements for introducing the system, like distribution of subjects, marking pattern and criteria for qualifying for the Part-I, II and III examinations. 

 After the undergraduate council gives its clearance, the matter will be discussed with students, teachers and principals and then placed before the universitys syndicate for ratification.

 It should not be a problem to introduce the system this year because no change is being made in the syllabi. This means the books will remain the same as before, a CU official said.

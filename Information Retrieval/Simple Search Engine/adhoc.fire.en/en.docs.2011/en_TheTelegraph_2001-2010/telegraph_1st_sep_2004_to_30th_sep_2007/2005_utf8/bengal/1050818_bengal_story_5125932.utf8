 Red alert after Bangla blasts

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Aug. 17: Within hours of the serial blasts in Bangladesh, the Bengal government sounded a red alert along all the bordering districts and asked police to step up vigil to eliminate the possibility of similar incidents taking place in the state.

 On Saturday, the police had recovered a dozen bombs from Bongaon in North 24-Parganas, which borders Bangladesh. 

 We believe the bombs were brought by Bangladeshi criminals and were meant to create terror in the state, said Ajay Aga, additional deputy inspector-general (operations) of the BSF, south Bengal frontier. 

 We had information about where they were stored and we carried out a raid and recovered them.

 At Writers Buildings, inspector-general (law and order) of state police Raj Kanojia said: Vigil was being maintained at the highest level.

 The police have been instructed to activate their intelligence network so that similar incidents do not take place on this side of the border, Kanojia said.

 He explained that there was no information of the possibility of such incidents taking place in the state. 

 Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy said three explosion-proof cars were being brought for use by the chief minister and other VIPs.

 We are not taking anything lightly and are keeping a close watch on the activities of some militant organisations in the state, Roy added. 

 The high state of security in force for August 15 has been extended.

 On the Bangladesh border, the effort will be to prevent the perpetrators of the blasts from sneaking into India for refuge, as is the wont of criminals from that side.

 We have information that those who triggered the blasts in Bangladesh may try to enter India to escape the heat in Bangladesh, said Aswini Kumar Agarwal, the additional director-general of the BSF. 

 All the outposts of the BSF are at the ready and additional forces have been put on the job to virtually seal the border.

 BSF officials said the bombs found in Bongaon on Sunday are very similar in nature to the ones that went off in Bangladesh.

 They are not very sophisticated and are high on noise but low on damage potential, an official said. 

 They were recovered from the house of a local criminal. They were hidden in an aluminium container and buried in the courtyard.

 Late this evening, the state secretariat of the CPM held an emergency meeting to assess the situation arising out of the blasts in Bangladesh. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee informed the party leadership of the steps his government had taken.

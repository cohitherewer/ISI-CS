 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, July 26: Irrigation minister Ganesh Mondal died this afternoon. He was 68.

 Mondal, who is survived by wife, two daughters and a son, was admitted to SSKM Hospital with pneumonia on July 13. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said Mondal was a simple man with a spartan lifestyle. A former headmaster of a school in South 24-Parganas, the RSP leader was first elected to the Assembly in 1967. He joined Jyoti Basus cabinet in 1991 as minister of state for irrigation and became a cabinet minister in Bhattacharjees regime. Mondal was secretary of the RSP peasants wing. The government has declared a half-day holiday tomorrow. 

 Darjeeling: Trouble erupted at Mount Hermon School ? one of the most prestigious institutions in Darjeeling ? when senior students went on the rampage after the authorities turned down their request to change a hostel warden. Students of the senior section (classes IX to XII), the majority of whom were boarders, broke windowpanes and skipped breakfast. They alleged that the warden had falsely implicated two students in a case of substance abuse. Four persons were accused. Of them two have been expelled. We have nothing against the expulsions, but the other two were innocent, an agitating student said.

 Behrampore: Two more persons were held on Monday night in connection with Sundays murder of a hotel owner and his son here. Four persons, including Congress MP Adhir Chowdhurys friend Tapan Bose and driver Gopal Sinha, were earlier picked up for their alleged involvement in the murders. Finger print experts visited Nilufa Hotel where Hanif Sheikh and Laltoo were shot dead.

 BRIEFS

 Midnapore, Aug. 12: Four-year-old Malabika Das was kidnapped from her school at an East Midnapore village this morning. 

 The KG-I student of a private nursery school is the daughter of a teacher, Bhudeb Das. When Bhudeb went to fetch his daughter from her school near Rampur, about 150 km from Calcutta, around 11 am, he did not find her there. A school attendant told me that a man identified himself as a relative and took her home. When I returned, she was not there, said the primary school teacher. Someone called up his neighbour about an hour later and demanded Rs 3 lakh. I was asked to hand over the ransom at Mecheda, he said. District police chief Ashok Dutta said all police stations have been put on alert.

 Behrampore: Shankarananda Sinha, an employee of a state-run womens home here, was arrested on Friday for allegedly raping a 16-year-old inmate. When the girl became pregnant, she told the authorities of Shilayan, about 200 km from Calcutta, that Sinha had raped her. 

 Calcutta: A high court division bench on Friday disposed of Trinamul Congress general secretary Mukul Roys petition seeking an order asking Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim to take action against Subrata Mukherjee. The court did not pass an order but asked advocate-general Balai Ray to request the Speaker to expedite Trinamul proceedings against the rebel MLA.

 Calcutta: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said rice parks would be set up in almost all districts across the state. On his return from Chennai, where he was shown paddy developed with genes of mangrove and cultivated in brackish water, Bhattacharjee held a meeting with Swami Sadananda, the secretary of Ramakrishna Ashram at Nimpith, South 24-Parganas, to explore the possibilities of a similar experiment.

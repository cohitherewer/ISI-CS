 School lunch lost in goof-up

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, May 22: A mistake in a circular issued by the Burdwan administration has cost mid-day meals to students of over 250 primary schools.

 Tapas Roy, the additional district magistrate who looks after activities of the zilla parishad, apparently misread a government directive and issued a circular on May 11 asking the institutions to provide the meals 200 days in a year. 

 But the Supreme Court had said that students in the 57,000 state-aided primary schools in Bengal must be given mid-day meals on 222 days. 

 District primary education council president Sahidul Haque said as a result of the confusion over the circular, sent to over 800 schools, many have stopped offering the mid-day meals. The revised circular has not reached many panchayats and this has led to a problem. The meals are not being served in over 250 primary schools in the district.

 Realising its mistake, the district administration directed the schools verbally to restore the mid-day meals. But sources said most schools were unwilling to do so until they received a fresh circular.

 We cannot restore the mid-day meals on the basis of a verbal instruction because of certain technical problems. When we stopped the meals, we told the villagers that we took the decision on the basis of the district administrations directive. Now, if we reintroduce the meal only on the basis of the verbal order, the guardians will hold us responsible, said Sangram Sinha, a primary school teacher.

 Subdivisional officer Kasturi Sengupta said the problem was a result of the faulty circular. She added: The circular that the administration had sent to the schools has been withdrawn. We are looking into complaints that many of the institutions have not resumed serving the meals despite the withdrawal of the order.

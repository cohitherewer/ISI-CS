 Pitch for chem hub

 Calcutta, Dec. 16: After lobbying with the Centre for a chemical hub in Haldia, Bengal is trying its luck with NRIs.

 At a recent interface with states and the Centre held in Delhi by US-based NRIs, Bengal campaigned for the Haldia chemical hub. 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was the only chief minister present from five states short-listed for the meet on the chemicals sector. Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat were represented by commerce and industries ministers.

 We told them that we had an edge over others as we already have a large refinery and a petrochemical hub in Haldia, commerce and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen said.

 Headmaster in the dock

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, June 16: The headmaster of a high school in Murshidabad has been accused of getting his son a clerks job in the institution with a false appointment letter. 

 However, no one suspected any wrong doing for three years till Bamdeb Ghosh approached the high court with a petition to be made a permanent employee of Ramnagar High School at Rejinagar, about 220 km from Calcutta.

 Students and guardians today locked up classrooms and the schools main gate demanding headmaster Anandamohan Ghoshs ouster.

 After a notice on Bamdebs case came to the school managing committee on May 31, its secretary called a meeting yesterday. A dozen members, including four who were part of the previous committee, attended the meeting and they all said they were ignorant of any such appointment. The appointment letter furnished by Bamdeb was false, said Krishna Chandra Hazra, its secretary. The headmaster and his son were present at the meeting.

 Hazra said the meeting decided to suspend Ghosh. We also told him (the headmaster) that all important documents should henceforth be kept with the secretary.

 Sparks flew regarding what transpired at the meeting. Hazra said the Ghoshs tore off certain documents. The headmaster alleged that he and his son were beaten up. 

 Hazra went to police after the meeting. Deputy superintendent, headquarters, Zahidur Rehman, said he has ordered immediate arrest of the headmaster and his son. A police team went to his house this morning but neither of them was found.

 District inspector of schools Shubhendu Ghosh has ordered a probe.

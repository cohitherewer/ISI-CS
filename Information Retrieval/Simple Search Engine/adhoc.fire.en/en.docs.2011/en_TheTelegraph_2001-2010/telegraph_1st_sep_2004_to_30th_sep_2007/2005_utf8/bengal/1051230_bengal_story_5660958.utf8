 Voter cards

 Calcutta, Dec. 29: The Election Commission today said that names of those who have not collected their election photo identity card (EPIC) or have not approached the election authorities for it may be deleted from electoral rolls.

 It is the responsibility of the voters to get their photo identity cards, chief electoral officer Debashish Sen said.

 The Election Commission will soon send notices to those who have not collected their EPICs. If they do not collect the EPICs, their names might be deleted, said Sen.

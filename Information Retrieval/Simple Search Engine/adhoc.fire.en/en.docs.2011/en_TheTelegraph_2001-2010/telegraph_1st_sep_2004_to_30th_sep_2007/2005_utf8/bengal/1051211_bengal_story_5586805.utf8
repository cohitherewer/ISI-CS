 Boast lands killer in net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bolpur, Dec. 10: A chance admission made in a moment of carelessness has led police to begin a murder case against a man five years after the killing of a two-year-old child in Birbhum.

 Police arrested Dasarath Das from his house last night after he confessed in the presence of over 50 villagers that he had murdered Biswadeb, the child of his cousin Jagannath Das on the night of March 10, 2000. 

 Dasarath said he murdered the child to avenge an alleged affair Jagannath had with his wife.

 A day after his son went missing, Jagannath went to the police. Dasarath found Biswadebs body on the bank of the Bakreswar on March 12. But no one was arrested because of lack of evidence, a senior police officer said. 

 A probe was conducted but the case remained unsolved.

 On March 21 this year, Dasarath was arrested on the charge of wounding his wife Krishna with a chopper. Following a complaint by his wife, he was sent to Suri jail for three months.

 During his stay in jail, Dasarath became friendly with an inmate, Sheikh Mustaq. In an apparent show of bravado, Dasarath narrated to him how he murdered Biswadeb to avenge Krishnas affair with Jagannath.

 After his release from jail on June 2, Dasarath returned to Gargaria village, about 210 km from Calcutta, and continued to live with his wife.

 When Mustaq returned to the neighbouring Bheramari village, about 5 km from Gargaria, after his release in October, he told the village elders about Dasaraths hand in the murder.

 Soon, word travelled from one village to the other and three days ago, Jagannath came to know about it. 

 Jagannath, along with about 50 other villagers, confronted Dasarath, said Birbhum superintendent of police Sanjay Singh. Though Dasarath initially denied having committed the murder, he later confessed to having killed the child.

 Singh said Dasarath was arrested last night on the basis of Jagannaths complaint. We have started a murder case today against Dasarath and a probe is on to find out if some others were also involved in the childs murder, he added.

 Jagannath said he could not imagine that his cousin could commit such a heinous crime. It was Dasarath who spotted my childs body on the bank of Bakreswar river. We never thought that he could be the killer.

 Jagannaths wife Rani was unable to speak. She is still in a state of shock.

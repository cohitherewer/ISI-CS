 Holiday cure in Bengal

 - Diwali debut for tourist cottage offering ayurvedic therapy amp; pampering massages

 Ready for the healing touch?

 Calcutta, Oct. 9: Bengal could well go the Kerala way if an experiment in ayurvedic tourism manages to evoke the desired response.

 Exotic massages and traditional skincare in the lap of nature can now be had in Bengal ? at Gar Panchakot near Bokaro, about 250 km from Calcutta.

 The state forest development corporation is set to open doors to a new lodge there this Diwali. 

 If the scheme works out, we could develop it further and replicate it at other places as well. Buxa is another good possibility as it is also rich in medicinal plants and herbs, corporation director Arin Ghosh said. 

 The corporation has 12 eco-lodges across Bengal, but the concept of ayurvedic tourism centres is fresh. 

 When we chanced upon the heritage of medicinal plants at Gar Panchakot, we decided to find out if there were any local ayurveda practitioners in the area and to involve them in the tourism project as well, Ghosh said.

 Gar Panchakot had 35 Ayurveda practitioners and masseurs. Around 10 of them have been shortlisted and they will have to go through an orientation programme organised by the Ayurveda Board. 

 We have handed over their certificates to the board to verify their credentials, said Ghosh. 

 For now, both the ayurveda treatments and the massages will be provided at the same place at Gar Panchakot but, if the response is good, we will build a full fledged ayurveda centre there, he added. 

 Although star resorts like Sinclairs Dooars in north Bengal, Ffort Radisson at Raichak and the Oberoi Spa offer ayurvedic treatments in Bengal, Gar Panchakot will promote ayurveda at its roots ? in an area where medicinal plants grow naturally and at a village that has a tradition of ayurveda. 

 In Kerala, one of the reasons why ayurveda caught on was because it was always part of the local tradition, being used by the Kalari martial artists and the Kathakali dancers for deep-tissue treatments. 

 The easily available trained manpower was what the resorts and hotels that offered ayurveda there cashed in on. The government moved in later to make it the states USP (unique selling proposition).

 River power set to debut after commercial stamp

 Calcutta, April 10: Tidal waves will be tamed to generate electricity in Bengal with the power department giving its green signal for the installation of a 3.6-mw tidal power plant in South 24-Parganas. 

 ?The feasibility study for the project has been completed and it was found commercially viable,? said S.P. Gon Chaudhuri, managing director of the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency. 

 The project will mark a big leap in the generation of green power. ?Pollution will be almost zero for the generation of power on this scale. This is the first project of its kind to be implemented in our country,? said Gon Chaudhuri, also the special secretary to the power department.

 Officials said the project site has been selected ? on the Durgadewani river ? where the strength of tidal waves is enough to generate power. ?To make the project a success, we have to choose those parts of the river where a sharp difference is discernible in water levels during high tide and low tide,? Gon Chaudhuri said. 

 Explaining the process, an agency officer said a bottleneck is artificially created in the selected part of the river where water will gush out in a rapid torrent during high tide and will subside with nearly the same force during low tide. ?The force of the water will be used to create a variation in air pressure, which will rotate a turbine for generation of electricity. The air pressure is adjusted in such a way that the turbines will rotate continuously during both high and low tides,? the official said. 

 The specialised turbine, to be used for the project, will be supplied by a Canadian agency. The electricity generated by the turbine will be used locally and the excess power may be fed into the state power grid.

 The energy research department of IIT Chennai examined the project?s feasibility. The study said it would be ?technically viable for several decades to come?. Gon Chaudhuri said: ?The estimated budget for the project has been fixed at Rs 30 crore and it will take at least 30 months to go into generation. Work on the project will begin soon.?

 South 24-Parganas district magistrate Vivek Kumar said: ?The administrative hurdles have been cleared so that the agency can go ahead with the work.?

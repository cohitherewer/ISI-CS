 Lonely girl loses burns battle

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Jan. 13: The 22-year-old daughter of a railway official who set herself on fire on January 6 died tonight at a private hospital here.

 She was found engulfed in flames in the family?s sixth-floor flat at Rail Minar, the residential complex for railway officials on Judges Court Road.

 ?She was first admitted at South-Eastern Railway?s BNR Hospital and later shifted to Apollo Gleneagles, where she succumbed to injuries tonight,? deputy commissioner of police Peeyush Pandey said.

 The woman had given a one-line statement to the police saying she was suffering from depression and no one was to be blamed. But the police said they were looking for the friend who was with her that night ? and burnt his hands trying to save her ? to question him.

 The girl had returned to the city on January 3 from Mumbai while on the way with her mother to rejoin her father in Gujarat. She changed her mind as she was preparing for the civil services exams, family sources said.

 She also told her parents that she was feeling depressed and wanted to stay alone for a while.

 She was going to Gujarat after sitting for the BA (English) final examinations under the Indira Gandhi National Open University in Calcutta in December.

 Her father had left for Gujarat on November 23 to take up his new assignment as a divisional railway manager.

 Family sources said the young woman, ?a very sensitive person who used to write poems?, had started feeling lonely and depressed in 2001 when her brother went away to Maharashtra for studies. 

 They added that she had tried to commit suicide once earlier.

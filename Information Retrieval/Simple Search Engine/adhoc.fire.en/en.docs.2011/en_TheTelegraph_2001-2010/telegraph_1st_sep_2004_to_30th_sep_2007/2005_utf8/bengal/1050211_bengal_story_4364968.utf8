 Class V tests peeve parents 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Feb. 10: Guardians of students in three schools in Burdwan town are confused after the authorities put up a notice announcing entrance tests to Class V. 

 Seven months ago, Calcutta High Court had debarred secondary schools from holding entrance tests for admitting their own Class IV students to Class V. 

 The order, passed after a similar confusion in a Howrah school, said Class IV students will have to be taken in to Class V of the same school on priority basis. If seats were left, then outside pupils could be taken in, the court had added.

 Guardians of Class IV students of CMS High School here today approached the district authorities. 

 ?My son had to appear for an admission test to Class I. Now, the school says there will be another test for Class V. But we know the high court order. We are now in a quandary,? said Chumki Das, mother of Soumyadeep of CMS.

 Burdwan Town School and Vidyarthi Bhavan Girls? School, too, have put up notices for the test scheduled for the first week of April. 

 Biswajit Chowdhury, headmaster of CMS, said ?we have received no government order in this regard?. 

 The confusion can be traced to the school education department?s and the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education?s failure to convey the court directive to all 12,000 secondary and junior high schools in the state.

 ?We could not give any directive to our affiliated schools because we have not received official instruction from the government,? said Dibyendu Hota, board president.

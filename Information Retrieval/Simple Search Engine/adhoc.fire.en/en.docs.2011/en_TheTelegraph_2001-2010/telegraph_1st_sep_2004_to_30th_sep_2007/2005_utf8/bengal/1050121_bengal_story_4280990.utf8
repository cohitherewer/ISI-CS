 BRIEFS

 Midnapore, Jan. 20: Six people were killed when fireworks for display at a local festival exploded last night in a village in West Midnapore, about 220 km from Calcutta. 

 The bodies were mutilated almost beyond recognition. Police said among the dead were Krishnapada Bera, 70, a villager, and fireworks experts hired from outside the village. They were identified as Pulin Jana, 48, Padmalochan Dalapati, 35, Gurupada Jana, 22, Shyamapada Bera, 47, and Joydeb Bera, 35. At Talghora Picha village, near the Orissa border, the fireworks would have been part of festivities in connection with Makar Sankranti. They were being made in an abandoned hut where the local school used to hold classes earlier. District police chief Ajay Nanda said the explosion could have been triggered by petromax being used to light up the place or firewood to cook dinner.

 Krishnagar: Ranjana Patra, 21, allegedly committed suicide on Wednesday night because her father could not arrange a government servant as a groom. In this town, 85 km from Calcutta, Ranjana was supposed to get married on Sunday. Police said her elder sister had been married off to a government job holder. ?But for Ranjana, a graduate, her father found a wealthy trader who lives in Dum Dum Cantonment.?

 Siliguri: GNLF chief Subash Ghisingh came down to Siliguri from Darjeeling on Thursday evening. He is scheduled to meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in Sukna on Friday.

 BRIEFS

 Durgapur, May 13: Bhabesh Nag Biswas, an assistant general manager of Alloy Steel Plant here, was arrested tonight for allegedly harassing a lady colleague.

 Biswas was accused of making indecent proposals to her, said the Durgapur police station officer-in-charge. 

 Krishnagar: Shivananda Sarkar, 38, was shot dead by dacoits early on Friday morning when he tried to resist looting at his house in Shantipur, 75 km from Calcutta. Police said he was sleeping when the masked dacoits broke into the house and overpowered his brother Sanjoy. Seeing him held at gun-point, Sarkar pounced on one of the dacoits and was shot dead. The dacoits left in a hurry, but then struck in a neighbouring house. 

 Calcutta: Government employees in the districts would deliver reminder letters to voters yet to get voter I-cards. About 55 lakh voters do not have the cards. Earlier, the letters were delivered through couriers, but that proved expensive.

 Calcutta: Utpala Sen died at SSKM Hospital around noon on Friday. She was 82. A popular singer of adhunik (modern) Bengali songs, Sen worked with composers like Salil Chowdhury and Satinath Mukhopadhyay, her late husband.

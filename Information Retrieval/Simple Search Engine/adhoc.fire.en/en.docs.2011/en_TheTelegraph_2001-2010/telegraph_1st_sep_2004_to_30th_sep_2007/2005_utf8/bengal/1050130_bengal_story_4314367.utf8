 To SC door for judge shield

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 29: The All India Legal Aid Forum, an association of retired high court and Supreme Court judges and lawyers, will file a public interest litigation in the apex court seeking clarification from the state government on its criteria for providing security to distinguished persons.

 The decision to move court comes in the wake of withdrawal of guards from former judge Bhagabati Prosad Banerjee?s house in Salt Lake.

 The Supreme Court had dismissed the allotment of Banerjee?s FD block plot ? obtained from the chief minister?s quota in 1987 under ?inappropriate circumstances? ? and asked the government to auction the house.

 In 2000, the government deployed six armed policemen at the former judge?s residence on the basis of a central intelligence report that he featured on the hit list of fundamentalists, but the security was withdrawn on January 20 this year. 

 North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said he needed personnel to send them to Bihar and Jharkhand on election duty.

 Forum secretary Joydeep Mukherjee today said: ?We want to know on what ground the security was withdrawn... Is there a report from the central intelligence bureau that Banerjee does not have any threat??? 

 He added that the government was bound to provide armed security to retired high court and Supreme Court judges. ?The government has also denied guards to some other retired judges, but deployed them for those not entitled to.?

 CM sermon: give funds, get support

 Calcutta, Feb. 12: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today announced a ?give-and-take? policy towards the Congress-led Centre ?in the mutual interest? of the Left Front government in Bengal and the UPA government.

 ?We are supporting the government in Delhi and expect it to support us in Bengal,? he told a mammoth rally at the Brigade Parade grounds this afternoon after the conclusion of the CPM?s four-day state conference.

 ?Don?t try to oppose our agenda. Let us work without any hindrance. Don?t block the flow of funds needed for Bengal?s development,? Bhattacharjee told Delhi, in a veiled reference to Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia?s threat to slash central funds after the state failed to submit utilisation certificates for several projects.

 The chief minister also adopted a hard line vis-?-vis the state Congress, saying the CPM would not allow the party to stage a political comeback in Bengal. ?The state Congress is trying to strengthen its base in Bengal by exploiting its power at the Centre. But the party will not be able to succeed,? he said. 

 The chief minister chose the occasion to kick off his party?s campaign for elections to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) scheduled for June 19 by urging the people of Calcutta to ?remove the indisciplined Trinamul Congress? from the civic body.

 ?We want the city?s development, but not at the cost of its poor people and slum dwellers. To us, development does not mean construction of flyovers only. We care for 60 lakh people of Calcutta and particularly for about 17 lakh living in the city slums,? Bhattacharjee said. 

 ?Our policy is not to evict the slum dwellers as is being done in big metropolitan cities like Delhi and Mumbai. On the contrary, we care for these people. Ours is the only government in the country which has offered title deeds (ownership of land) to the slum dwellers. We have given them ration cards, helped them to form self-help groups to run their own business,? Bhattacharjee said, adding that ?Calcutta is not confined to posh areas like Park Street and Theatre Road only?. 

 Coming down heavily on the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamul Congress, Bhattacharjee said the party has no policy. ?It is indisciplined and its most heinous crime is to have allowed the communal BJP to get a foothold in our state,? he said. 

 The harsh remarks about the Trinamul-controlled CMC follows criticism he had earlier faced from his party colleagues in the Calcutta district committee (CDC) for praising mayor Subrata Mukherjee, particularly over reconstruction and takeover of Star Theatre. 

 The CDC members had not taken Bhattacharjee?s observation kindly, saying it would adversely affect the party?s prospects in the civic elections. Bhattacharjee seemed to be making amends with the frontal attack on the Trinamul leadership and the CMC.

 Trinamul had fared miserably in the May 10 Lok Sabha polls by winning only the Calcutta South seat. The state CPM hopes to wrest the CMC from the Trinamul-BJP combine as its nominees for the two other city Lok Sabha constituencies had trounced their Trinamul rivals in the last polls by huge margins.

 Kid killings jolt officers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Behrampore, Jan. 27: A spate of juvenile crime, including two murders within 10 days, at Hariharpara has the Murshidabad administration worried. 

 District magistrate N. Manjunatha Prasad and superintendent of police Sanjoy Singh will visit the area, 230 km from Calcutta, on Saturday. 

 The police arrested 12 boys aged between 10 and 14 on Tuesday in connection with the two murders where the victims were also minors. The sub-divisional judicial magistrate here has asked the police to produce them before the juvenile court in Salt Lake tomorrow. 

 On January 15, the body of Rupa Haldar, an eight-year-old schoolgirl, was found in a mustard field at Swaruppur village. Six boys were arrested. Police said they had confessed to killing her as she was stealing vegetables from a field. 

 Another six boys have been held for the death of 12-year-old Asraf Sheikh at Lalitpur village. Police said Asraf had demanded Rs 2,000 from one Tarjem, an 11-year-old, and his friend after they lost the money in gambling. Tarjem refused to pay and engaged several of his friends to kill Asraf. He offered to pay each Rs 100.

 Anil faces fusillade over Salim

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 3: State CPM secretary Anil Biswas today heard his comrades in South 24-Parganas seeking explanation yet again for the governments plan to hand over their land to the Salim Group.

 Although red-faced under pressure from his own party workers to allow them to talk at length on the move to transfer land to the Indonesia-based conglomerate, Biswas stood firm. 

 The issue has been discussed at length at different party forums, including at politburo and central committee. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has also addressed a gathering at Bhangar and explained his governments stand. I dont think we should discuss anything further on it at this meeting, he reportedly said.

 The CPM politburo member visited Baruipur during the day to address key members of the partys district secretariat and district committee on issues such as reconstituting local committees and minimising infighting. But the party functionaries only wanted to talk about the Salim projects. 

 Insiders later said Biswas took strong exception to the manner in which some members from the partys Mograhat unit raised their voices at the meeting demanding the discussion. 

 District secretary Santimoy Bhattacharjee was also embarrassed by his comrades behaviour in the presence of their state leader.

 The CPM district committee members who wanted to raise the issue were mostly members of the partys peasants wing, the Pradeshik Krishak Sabha. 

 Last Monday, the chief minister addressed a rally at Bhangar, also in the district, with land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla. He assured that no land would be acquired at Bhangar for the Salim projects. 

 He promised the farmers incentives if the government took over their land. Bhattacharjee told the gathering that the government would pay for the plots taken over at the market rate, provide alternative accommodation to each family displaced and a job to one member of each of them.

 But todays party meeting made it apparent that many did not buy the chief ministers assurances.

 Pressure stays on little shoulders, holidays or no

 RICHA BANSAL

 All study, little play: A school in Calcutta

 Calcutta, Oct. 15: Is your child already neck-deep in holiday homework this Puja vacation? 

 If not, it is unusual. Psychiatrists say that schools, though they make claims of innovative teaching methods, are not doing much despite the National Council for Educational Research and Trainings suggested guidelines to ease academic burden on children.

 City psychiatrists say a number of schools turn on the heat on children in more ways than one, in their race to produce better results. 

 And while children find it unable to cope with this mounting pressure, parents only add on to it by increasing the number of tuitions. 

 In extreme cases, some children are driven to commit suicide. 

 Dr. Aniruddha Deb, a psychiatrist working with schools, says: Schools take pride in teaching syllabus that is above the standard of the required class. Most conduct at least two weekly tests on an average at the primary level, when they are meant to run a continuous assessment system.

 Bad teaching, including new syllabus at the last moment, and poor quality of correction are also common, said Dr Rima Mukherji, another psychiatrist. 

 Dr Deb cited the example of a girls school that has piled on its Class III students eight projects in History and Geography as holiday homework. The History projects cover the Stone, Copper and Bronze Ages and the life of early man. In Geography, the students were given to do projects on the universe, the Milky Way, solar system and planets and deserts.

 In another school, though, students the same age and class were told to find out all you can about an animal of your choice during the holiday to talk about it in the class.

 It is important for parents to analyse their child and subject him to the amount of pressure he can take instead of becoming negative towards him, says Dr Mukherji.

 The solution is that parents find out what other schools do, read up on teaching methods and take action if their child is being subjected to unnecessary pressure. After all, they are ultimately responsible for their child, Dr Deb says.

 Anjali Basu (name changed), mother of a Class VI student, does exactly that. Though there are daily tests at my daughters school and the syllabus in certain subjects is well above the desired level, I have never pressurised her to run after marks, says Basu, a teacher herself. On the contrary I chose to ignore the school pressure. 

 But then, not all parents are as informed or as strong, says veteran teacher trainer Ayesha Das. This makes the responsibility dual. It is the heads of schools who really need to take action, even if transforming the system may be cumbersome. Moreover, one has to remember that schools can easily resort to using pressure if parents start objecting too much, she says.

 Sister Cyril, the principal of Loreto, Sealdah, agrees. Schools need to teach children to compete with themselves instead of competing with each other. If they continue to turn on the temperature like this, all they will get is boiled egg.

 But some principals claim it is difficult to convince parents in such matters. It took me four years to reform the system at my school and convince parents that it is for the benefit of their children, said Malini Bhagat, the Mahadevi Birla Girls School headmistress.

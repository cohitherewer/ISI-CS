 School turns into smuggler haven

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 18: When Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee decided to meet school children from North 24-Parganas in his chamber this afternoon, he had hardly bargained for what he would get to hear from some of them.

 Black marketeers and smugglers run wild in the neighbourhood around our school. We feel very disturbed attending classes during BSF raids. When BSF jawans chase them, the smugglers sometimes barge into our classrooms, while classes are on. Or, they sneak inside classrooms and lie flat on the gr-ound behind our benches, hiding from BSF personnel. We feel very scared during these times, recounted 16- year-old Amar Mondal.

 The Class XI student of Chhoygeria Rakhaldas Uchcha Vidyalaya, near the Petrapole border, 70 km from Calcutta, said fugitives and smugglers play hide-and-seek with the jawans frequently and seek refuge in the school.

 Sometimes, there are people running in the corridors, being chased by BSF jawans during school hours. At times, if things get very disturbing, classes are suspended and the school is closed. Please do something, Mondal requested.

 He later said the chief minister told him that he would take up the issue with the authorities concerned.

 Mondal was part of a batch of 20 students represen- ting 20 schools, which met Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings.

 Dipanwita Hazra from Shyamnagar Balika Vidyalaya said her school building was surrounded with the poisonous weed, parthenium, which causes allergies and respiratory problems.

 Other students recounted their problems, ranging from lack of toilets in school, to low teacher-student ratio and lack of facilities like library and playgrounds.

 After hearing all of us, the chief minister asked us to list our problems in writing and said he would look into them, said Shibashree Bhattacharjee, a member of the Students Council team. The council was set up by Prayasam, an NGO, in collaboration with Unicef with participation from 60 schools, including madarsas. Our objective is to make the children aware of their environment and empower them to speak their mind. We also want to sensitise the government to their problems, said Srinath Cheruvari, a Unicef officer.

 Buddha firm on April date for VAT

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 15: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today made it clear that his government is going to introduce value-added tax from April 1 despite sharp differences among the CPM leadership and the Front partners over its implementation.

 The chief minister, however, told CPM and Left Front leaders that his government would review the economic impact of VAT after a year.

 ?We want to see how much extra revenue we can earn after introduction of VAT and, at the same time, want to assess Centre-state relations on economic issues,? Bhattacharjee said during a Front meeting at CPM headquarters on Alimuddin Street.

 Left Front chairman Biman Bose said after the meeting that economists were divided over the introduction of VAT, adding that the Centre is insisting on introducing VAT in all states and several were seriously considering implementation.

 The proposal to introduce VAT came from Delhi when Jyoti Basu was chief minister. Numerous seminars and discussions were held on the pros and cons the new tax format.

 A review committee was also set up to examine the new tax format, Bose said. He felt there is scope for discussion and said ?we have informed the chief minister of this?.

 CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said several economists have given their opinions to the party leadership.

 ?We cannot ignore their views and discussions on the issue is still on in our party. The economists have pointed out both the positive and negative aspects of VAT and we are still considering their views seriously,? he said.

 CPM sources said Basu, during his tenure as chief minister, had avoided the introduction of VAT after senior party leaders and economists close to the party expressed displeasure over certain clauses.

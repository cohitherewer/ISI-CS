 Push to Asansol board clone

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 13: The CPM leadership in Nadia has urged the state government to constitute a development authority for Kalyani and Chakda, around 50 km from Calcutta, on the lines of the Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority. 

 The district CPM is also in favour of keeping Kalyani town out of the purview of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority. Kalyani municipality chairman Shantanu Jha today expressed displeasure over the functioning of the metropolitan authority, which now looks after the development of Kalyani town.

 There are about 1,000 acres of vacant land in the township but this was not utilised for development projects.

 Jha said the estate manager had turned down the plea by the civic body to construct a shopping complex.

 We believe only a specialised agency like ADDA can carry out development activities in a planned way, he said.

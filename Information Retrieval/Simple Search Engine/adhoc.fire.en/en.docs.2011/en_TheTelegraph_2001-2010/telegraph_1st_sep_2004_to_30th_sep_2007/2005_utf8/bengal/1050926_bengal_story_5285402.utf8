 Funds rain for water

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: The Centre has allocated Rs 2,200 crore for the augmentation of drinking water supply in rural and semi-urban areas ? one of the fattest moneybags from Delhi for Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees dispensation. 

 Public health engineering minister Gautam Deb today said that the amount would be spent to supply filtered water to the arsenic-affected areas in Nadia, Murshidabad, Malda and North 24-Parganas.

 The department had submitted seven schemes to the Centre a couple of months ago seeking financial assistance. All of them have been approved by the Planning Commission, an official said. 

 Delhi will bear 75 per cent of the project cost. To begin with, it has already despatched Rs 600 crore. On its part, the state government now has to pump in Rs 550 crore.

 Officials said Deb, who had been lobbying with the Centre for the financial assistance, was successful in convincing Union rural development ministry officials about the importance of the projects.

 Water will be collected from the Ganga and stored in overhead and underground reservoirs after filtration. Later, it will be supplied to individual houses through pipelines. Apart from connection to households and commercial establishments, there will be a sufficient number of streetside taps to help the poor collect drinking water, said Prabir Dutta, the engineer-in-chief of Debs department.

 Of the seven schemes, three will be implemented at Raghunathganj, Bhagabangola and Beldanga in Murshidabad, two at Chakdah and Nakashipara in Nadia and one each in Malda and at Gaighata in North 24-Parganas.

 Our target is to complete the projects in four years. The preliminary work has already started. Families in the rural arsenic-affected areas will get 40 litres of water every day. In the urban areas, they will get 70 litres a day, Dutta said.

 According to the joint secretary in the public health engineering department, J.N. Banerjee, 79 blocks spread across eight districts are arsenic affected and about 1.6 crore people at the risk of being afflicted with related diseases. We have already implemented five major piped-water schemes in Malda, Nadia, North and South 24-Parganas, he added. 

 Deb said: We have been able to supply arsenic-free water to 60 per cent of the affected people. It will be increased to 70 per cent next year. We expect to cover the entire arsenic-affected population after the proposed schemes are implemented.

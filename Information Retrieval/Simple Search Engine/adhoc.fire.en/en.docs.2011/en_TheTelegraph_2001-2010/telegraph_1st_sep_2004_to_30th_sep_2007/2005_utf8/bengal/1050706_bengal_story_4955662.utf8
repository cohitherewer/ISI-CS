 Widows bond in justice hour

 PRONAB MONDAL 

 Calcutta, July 5: Two widows who are bound by the same tragic fate reached out to each other on Tuesday.

 Ekdom mon kharap korben na, ami apnar pashey achhi. Apneeo shubichar paben (Dont lose heart, I am beside you. You will also get justice). This was the message that Bidisha Sen conveyed over telephone to Kanika Pal, hours after the accused involved in the killing of Chandan Sen were sentenced to imprisonment.

 Both the women, whose doctor husbands were murdered, shared their pain, sorrow, hope and expectations.

 After justice for Sens wife Bidisha, a resident of Baguiati, finally came today, she decided to stand by the side of Kanika, a resident of Bright Street, as a friend.

 Kanikas husband Sushil Pal, a gynaecologist of Serampore Walsh Hospital was murdered and his body was recovered from a canal in Sankrail last year. 

 I can understand how she is feeling now. Both of us have been going through same circumstances. I hope, the punishment of my husbands killers will help her to keep patience and boost up her mental strength, Bidisha said.

 Echoing similar thoughts, Kanika said: Yes, I am happy that finally justice has been delivered to Bidisha. It will help me to wait for the day when the killers of my husband will be thrown behind the bars forever. I will talk to her. Because, right now I need a friend like her.

 Both Bidisha and Kanika know what loneliness is. When I think about Sushil and his promise that we will walk rest of the stretch of our life together and find he is not there, everything around me becomes meaningless, said Kanika, mother of two daughters, Sreya and Srija. 

 Welcoming the punishment given by the Ranaghat court, Bidisha said: I am happy. I never prayed for their death. Had I done so, there would have been no difference between me and the killers. From now on another battle begins. Because, I will try my level best to ensure that the killers get the same punishment if they move the high court.

 On the other hand, Kanika thinks the killer should have been hanged till death. They have no right to live in this society. How can people be so cruel? she asked.

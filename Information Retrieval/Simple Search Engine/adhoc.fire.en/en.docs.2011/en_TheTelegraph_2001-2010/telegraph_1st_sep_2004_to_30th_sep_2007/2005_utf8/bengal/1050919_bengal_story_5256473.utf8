Calcutta, Sept. 18: Delhi will press for a new set of guidelines to control flood and river bank erosion in several Bengal districts and in Bangladesh, Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said today.

 The issue will figure in the Joint River Commission meeting scheduled tomorrow in Dhaka between the minister and his Bangladeshi counterpart.

 Das Munshi today met the Bengal and Tripura chief ministers ? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Manik Sarkar ? at Writers Buildings and discussed issues that the Centre wants to raise tomorrow.

 Rivers flowing from this country into Bangladesh mostly flow through Bengal, Assam and Tripura. I have spoken to the Assam government and some key issues involving the rivers Ichhamati and Teesta in Bengal and the Feni and the Muhuri of Assam were discussed, the minister said.

 At least 59 rivers flow into Bangladesh from India. 

 Negotiation over distribution of the Teesta water is the key issue, the problem being that water from the river is not sufficient during the lean season. India contends that any negotiation on it must be based on the fact that 80 per cent of the Teestas catchment area is on its side. We want logical distribution, Das Munshi said.

 The other issue is flooding by the Ichhamati. A joint task force was formed to suggest remedies five years ago. 

 An official said the problem with tackling erosion in India is that if measures are taken on this side, they adversely affect the other. Some protocol has to be established so that the problem can be resolved at the local level.

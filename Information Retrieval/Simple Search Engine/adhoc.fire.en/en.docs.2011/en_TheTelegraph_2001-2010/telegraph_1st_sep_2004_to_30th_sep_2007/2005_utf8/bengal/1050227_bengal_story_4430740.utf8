 TV cloud on Oscars

 Calcutta, Feb. 26: Beam battle came to a boil this evening as the STAR and Sony bouquet of channels disappeared from the screens of around 2.5 lakh households.

 The two broadcasters switched off cable operators under Calcutta Communications, a unit of multi-system operator (MSO) SitiCable on charges of signal piracy.

 Cable homes serviced by Calcutta Communications ? in areas such as Ballygunge, Jodhpur Park and Camac Street ? are set to miss out on the Academy Awards on Monday morning, the final episodes of Indian Idol as well as other programmes on channels like STAR Plus and Sony.

 The beam would, however, be available on Purvalaya Communications, the other unit of SitiCable that services a part of south Calcutta.

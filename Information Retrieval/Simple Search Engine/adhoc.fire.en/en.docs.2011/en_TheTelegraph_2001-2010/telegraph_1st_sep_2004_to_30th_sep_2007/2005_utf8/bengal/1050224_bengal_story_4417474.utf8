 Jumbo PSU reform plan 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Feb. 23: Public sector units: 33. 

 Employees: 80,000. 

 Annual loss: Rs 1,700 crore. 

 These are the figures on the drawing board as chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee embarks on the government?s biggest restructuring exercise under the second phase of a scheme supported by Britain?s Department for International Development (DFID) to reform the units. 

 The proposals have to reach the Centre by the end of this financial year. 

 Of the 33 units, 21 are in the manufacturing sector and 12 in the services and utilities sector. 

 With a workforce of over 40,000, the power sector, comprising the state electricity board and the Durgapur Projects Limited, forms a major slice in the restructuring pie. 

 Other major players include the five state transport undertakings, including the Calcutta Tramways Company, employing over 22,000 people. 

 The public enterprises (PE) and industrial reconstruction department is strengthening its cell to oversee the financial, legal and accounting aspects of the restructuring exercise. The PE cell will be housed in Writers? Buildings. 

 A consultant has been engaged to identify the functions of the cell and the skill-sets its employees would need to help the government engage the right people. 

 ?All units organisationally unviable would be shut down, while joint venture partners would be sought for those needing capital investment. Others which don?t need investment would be restructured, including the workforce,? an official of the department said. 

 The transport department has employed a consultant to study how best its undertakings can be turned around while the cottage and small-scale industries department has submitted a proposal seeking Rs 130 crore to restructure 11 loss-making units, including Tantuja and Tantushree. 

 The commerce and industries department is planning to restructure five sick undertakings. Some of the units under departments like minor irrigation and animal resources are also under the scanner.

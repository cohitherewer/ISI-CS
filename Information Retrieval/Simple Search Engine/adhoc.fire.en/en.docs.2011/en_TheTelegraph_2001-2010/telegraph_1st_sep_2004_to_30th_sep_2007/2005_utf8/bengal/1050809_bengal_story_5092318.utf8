 Bystander killed in pile-up

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug 8: Twenty-year-old Juber Alam, who was stanfing on the edge of a footpath, was killed by a taxi near Esplanade this evening after a bus rammed into a Maruti car triggering a series of collisions. 

 Police said the taxi was waiting for signal on the western flank of Jawahar Lal Nehru Road off Bidhan Market around 6.45 pm and the Maruti was next to it.

 The bus on route 41B, travelling south to north, lost control and hit the car. Unable to bear the impact of collision, the Maruti surged ahead and hit the taxi, which in turn hit Juber. 

 The bleeding youth was immediately picked up and rushed to Medical College and Hospital where he fought death for over two-and-a-half hours. 

 One Swapan Sarkar was injured, said witnesses, adding that many more could have been killed, particularly at a time when the office crowd was heading home. 

 The over-crowded bus, traffic officials said, was rushing to clear the signal at the JL Nehru Road-SN Banerjee Road intersection ? commonly known as Dorina Crossing ? when the traffic signals changed and all vehicles ahead came to a halt. 

 The bus driver, despite cutting down on the speed, somehow failed to bring the vehicle to a stop and hit the car in front. It simply surged ahead and rammed into the taxi, which went on to hit the pavement on the left. Before the two youths could move out, the taxi hit them, said one of the stall owners at Bidhan Market. 

 Rattled bystanders raised an alarm and picked upon the bus driver along with the drivers of the other two vehicles. All the three vehicles were taken to the New Market police station.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, July 27: A clash broke out at Shyamaprasad College today allegedly over a group teasing a girl. A boy, injured in the clash, was taken to SSKM hospital.

 Principal Jnanankur Goswami, however, said the brawl was over the coming college elections and no girl had complained to him about teasing. He said she as well as the injured boy could be outsiders and it would be verified tomorrow. A police picket has been posted at the college. 

 Chinsurah: The management of Hyderabad Industries, a unit belonging to the C.K. Birla group, in Hooghly on Wednesday issued a suspension of work notice, rendering around 650 people jobless. The unit manufactures heavy machinery like cranes. 

 Basapara (Birbhum): Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday demanded a CBI probe into the 2000 Suchpur massacre, which killed 11 landless farmers. The Trinamul Congress chief was addressing a rally at this village in Suchpur.

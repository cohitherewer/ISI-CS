 Cop held for Bangla sneak-in

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, July 26: An assistant sub-ins-pector posted at Park Street police station was detained along with his wife and son on the Bangladesh border today for travelling across by paying touts.

 When the border guards wanted to see his travel documents, Arabinda Sana tried to get away by announcing that he was Calcutta police officer. 

 At the Ghojadanga international checkpost in North 24-Parganas, BSF jawans caught Sana while he was trying to cross over to India around 11 am.

 Having intercepted the intruders, BSF officers asked them to stand in a row and show their papers. 

 Sana suddenly stepped out of the line, called for the senior-most officer of the battalion and told him that he was a city police officer. 

 When the officer refused to believe, he produced his identity card.

 Sana was then taken to a room with his wife and child and made to wait for sometime. Meanwhile, our men called up the Park Street police station to confirm and were stunned to know that he was telling the truth, a senior officer said. 

 The assistant sub-inspector of police later confessed that he was on leave and had crossed over to Bangladesh to meet his in-laws in Khulna. He paid Rs 800 to a tout on his way to Bangladesh and Rs 1,100 on the way back.

 A BSF officer said he would be handed over to the Basirhat police station after interrogation. The Park Street police station apparently told the BSF officers that Sana had already overshot his leave. 

 Till late in the evening, senior police officers in Calcutta were in the dark about the incident. I will look into the matter, said Anuj Sharma, the deputy commissioner of police, headquarters. 

 For the BSF, however, the catch was one off many round the year. 

 Today the Sanas were part of a group of 13. The rest, sources said, were genuine intruders.

 A senior BSF officer said: Around 7,000 to 8,000 people are intercepted in south Bengal in a year.

 Besides Karimpur in Nadia, the sources said, Ghojadanga was one border outpost that registered heavy flow of people from both ends through the year.

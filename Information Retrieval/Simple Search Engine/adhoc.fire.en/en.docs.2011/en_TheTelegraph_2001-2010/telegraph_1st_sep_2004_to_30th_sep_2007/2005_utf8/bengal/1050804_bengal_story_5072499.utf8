 Showdown on land bill looms

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug 3: A storm is brewing in the Assembly with the Opposition parties ? the Trinamul Congress and Congress ? determined to thwart the governments move to pass the land reforms bill.

 Although the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government will table the West Bengal Land Reforms (Amendment) Bill, 2005, with some rectifications following suggestions from the Forward Bloc, it is bound to invite howls of protest from the Opposition. 

 All key ministers, including the chief minister, will be present in the House when the bill will be placed by land and land reforms minister Abdul Rezzak Mollah.

 The ruling CPM is also facing flak within the organisation with even Mollah openly speaking out against certain clauses of the bill, though he later gave his consent.

 According to insiders, if the CPM members persist with their criticism of the bill, it would cast a cloud on Bhattacharjees two dream projects. 

 A special economic zone on about 5,100 acres in Bhangar, Bishnupur and Magrahat in South 24-Parganas, proposed by the Indonesia-based Salim group, and a steel unit on around 4,000 acres at Guptamani in Jhargram, proposed by the Jindal Group, might not sail through if the government fails to secure a safe passage for the bill. 

 Insiders said the matter was raised during the CPMs Calcutta and South 24-Parganas district conferences last year. Bhattacharjee had then clearly told his party leaders that his government would use some agricultural land for commercial purposes to promote industry. 

 We will oppose the bill tooth and nail, come what may. We cannot allow the government to deprive poor and marginal farmers of their agricultural land for industrialisation. We are not against industrialisation but farmers have to be properly rehabilitated, Trinamul MLA Saugata Roy said.

 Till date, we have no information that the government will amend certain clauses of the bill. We also dont think that the government will give up its plan to use agricultural land for commercial purposes, he added. 

 Members of the Opposition said they would put pressure on Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim to prevent the bill from being sent to the standing committee. 

 The governments Left Front partners ? the Forward Bloc, CPI and the RSP ? had demanded the scrapping of the clause that would help the government convert agricultural plots for commercial use.

 The other point on which the government faced criticism was allowing owners of closed industrial units to use their land for commercial use. 

 Some influential CPM leaders wanted the Bhattacharjee government to impose restrictions on the sale on plots on which closed industrial units stand. Land belonging to the closed units should be used exclusively for setting up new industrial units and to accommodate workers of the closed unit, said a senior CPM leader.

 But there is no such provision in the bill. Owners will be allowed to sell their land once they agree to pay arrears to the employees of the closed unit.

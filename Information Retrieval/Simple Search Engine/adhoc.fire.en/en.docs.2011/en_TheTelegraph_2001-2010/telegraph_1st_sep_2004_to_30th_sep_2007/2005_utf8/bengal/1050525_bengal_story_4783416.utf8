 Charity to bring cops closer home

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, May 24: Cattle were stolen almost everyday and dacoit raids were increasingly common, but the residents of Teghoria, Badbillo and Durgapur in Nadia struggled to lodge a police complaint leave alone expect justice.

 The nearest police station was 22 km away and the district administration had shown little interest in bridging the gap. But five residents out of about 5,000 in the remote villages found a way ? to pressure the babus into action. 

 About 170 km from Calcutta, they donated almost three bighas (43,200 sq ft) for a police outpost to district superintendent R. Rajshekharan.

 The administration has agreed to open an outpost there. Rajshekharan admitted that the main reason behind the lack of surveillance in the area was distance from the Nakashipara police station. Incidents of crime reported from the area was low because the people found it difficult to come to the police station because of lack of communication, he added. 

 Villagers said the lack of police vigil had led to a sharp rise in the crime graph. When our repeated requests to the administration for a police outpost in the area failed to evoke any response, five villagers came forward, said Barun Ghosh, a farmer, whose shallow pump was stolen thrice over the past year. 

 Cattle are stolen every day and incidents of dacoity are regular, said Ghosh.

 Bhadu Mondal, 50, one of the two widows who donated half-a-bigha, said dacoits had raided her house and molested her daughter. We can recover from the shock of looting. But how can we bear to see our daughters being raped or molested? she asked. 

 Saraswati Biswas, 35, whose husband was killed by dacoits two years ago, also donated half-a-bigha. I am left to fend for myself with my two daughters. I decided to donate the land for the safety of my children, she said.

 Schoolteacher Sadhan Pramanik said reporting crime to the police is next to impossible as there is no proper road out of the village. We live 22 km from the nearest metalled road, which is National Highway 34. Lack of connectivity has put us in a miserable position. We are looking forward to the newly sanctioned police outpost, he said.

 The villagers have to trek through paddy fields to reach the nearest road. During monsoon, the rain washes out the paddy field dividers (aal) and we are virtually cut off from the rest of Bengal, said a farmer.

 A mode of contact with the world is the Jalangi river, 3 km away. That is the route the dacoits use to their advantage. 

 Pramanik said: Our essential commodities are also brought in by boat ? from Chapra on the other side of the Jalangi.

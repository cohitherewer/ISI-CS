 Court eye on teacher schools

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 4: The high court today came down heavily on the school education department for not adopting a common yardstick while allowing NGOs to set up training institutes for primary school teachers.

 Hearing a petition filed by an NGO, Justice Pratap Roy asked the authorities of at least 40 primary teachers? training institutes across Bengal to file affidavits showing enough grounds why their registrations should not be cancelled for not complying with norms.

 The court order came at a time when primary school teachers are under the scanner across Bengal. 

 Following complaints by parents and village education committees about the competence of some of them, the Nadia education authorities have already decided to set up teams of experts comprising retired teachers and headmasters to assess their performance.

 The primary education department had placed before the court documents relating to the registration of NGOs who wanted to set up primary teacher training institutes. After going through them, the judge said there were gross irregularities on the part of the department in allowing the NGOs to set up the institutes.

 The matter will come up for hearing on April 28 when the authorities of the 40 institutes will have to be present with their affidavits.

 Deben Mahato Smriti Raksha Committee, an NGO of Bolpur in Birbhum, had moved a writ petition before challenging the ?illegal and arbitrary? action on the part of the West Bengal Board of Primary Education while refusing to grant recognition for its primary teachers? training school.

 The petitioner?s lawyer alleged that his client was denied recognition even though it had fulfilled all the norms framed by the department for getting the registration. 

 Last year, the government decided to allow the NGOs to set up primary teachers? training institutes. According to rule, the NGO had to submit Rs 5 lakh and have adequate infrastructure. 

 The lawyer for the petitioner named NGOs to show how some of them had got the permit flouting the criteria.

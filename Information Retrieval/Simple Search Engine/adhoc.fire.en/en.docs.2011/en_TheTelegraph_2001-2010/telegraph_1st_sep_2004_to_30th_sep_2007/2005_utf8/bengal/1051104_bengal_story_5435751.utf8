 UK help for Bengal poor

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 Calcutta, Nov. 3: After the governments, it is the non-government sectors turn to count benefits of British bounty. 

 Department for international development (DFID), the UKs development aid agency, is set to launch a programme for NGOs, self-help groups and community-support organisations working among the poor and socially neglected.

 The agency will offer a grant of ?5.3 million (about Rs 40 crore) under the Civil Society Support Programme. The objective: to promote a partnership between civil organisations and the government.

 Most DFID programmes are implemented through the government but it cannot alone do everything that needs to be done for the poor and the civil society must pitch in. That is why the present programme was conceptualised, said Shantanu Das, the DFID representative in the state. The new programme, Das added, will complement other DFID projects in Bengal, especially those on rural decentralisation.

 At the national level, DFID funds the Poorest Areas Civil Society Programme. The seven-year-old scheme strives to strengthen organisations working in some of the countrys most backward districts. It covers over 10,500 villages in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh through about 350 organisations. 

 The programme here will be on the lines of the national scheme. Funds would be offered to organisations to implement projects that benefit the poor and those socially excluded and marginalised.

 In the initial stages, Purulia, Murshidabad, Birbhum, North Dinajpur, South Dinajpur, Malda and Cooch Behar will be part of the programme.

 After about three years of talks with the state, DFID decided to launch the programme for five years. The government will not be part of the programme directly but its officials would be on the panel reviewing the work. The Centre has given it the green signal. A management firm to be chosen in a couple of months would act as the implementing agency.

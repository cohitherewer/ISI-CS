 Doctor held for molestation

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Jan. 8: A senior medical officer of Eastern Railway was arrested last night on charges of molestation at the Ranaghat railway clinic.

 A 17-year-old polio-inflicted college girl had last evening complained to police that the medical officer, Sanjit Chakraborty, had molested her mother at the clinic, about 65 km from Calcutta. She said the doctor even assaulted her when she tried to save her mother.

 Chakraborty, who denied all the charges, was produced before the subdivisional court of Ranaghat and granted interim bail till Monday.

 Anjana Sarkar, a class XI student of Santipur College in Nadia district, had complained to police yesterday that on the night of December 31 Chakraborty had molested and tried to rape her mother Sandhyarani when the two had gone to get a medical certificate. Sarkar alleged that the doctor had asked for Rs 500 bribe from her mother.

 ?When my mother refused the doctor to give bribe, the doctor asked my mother to leave his chamber. But my mother was desperate and kept pressing for the certificate and the doctor hurled abuses at her and molested her in front of me. When I tried to stop him, he assaulted me without caring that I am physically-handicapped and polio afflicted,? said the girl.

 However, the Sarkars did not oppose the bail plea moved by the defence lawyer when the doctor was produced in court. ?It is true that the doctor acted inhumanly. He defamed my mother that evening. But my father is also a railway employee. So I decided not to oppose his bail prayer as we are also part of a railway community,? the girl said.

 Police said the family preferred to keep quiet for some days as they felt a protest would lead to trouble for Ashok Sarkar who works as a railway cabin man. Sandhyarani said that though her husband was not in favour of going to the police, she felt that if she didn?t protest the doctor would get away with the crime and lodged a complaint with the Ranaghat subdivisional judicial magistrate on January 3.

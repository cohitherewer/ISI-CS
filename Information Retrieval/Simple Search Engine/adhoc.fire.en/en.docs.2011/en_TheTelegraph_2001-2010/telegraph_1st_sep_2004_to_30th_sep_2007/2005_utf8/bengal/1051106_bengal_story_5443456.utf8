 Test mantra before tying knot

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARYA

 All clear? 

 Calcutta, Nov. 5: The government may still be napping, but marriage registrars and priests have woken up to the importance of getting blood tests done before walking down the aisle.

 A few days ago, the state judicial department had informed the health department that making blood tests mandatory before marriage to rule out HIV or thalassaemia was impossible for the time being.

 However, the apex body of marriage registrars and several organisations of priests in North 24-Parganas have decided to register marriages and conduct rituals only if the groom and the bride clear thalassaemia and HIV tests. 

 The marriage season is coming close and nearly a lakh couples will tie the knot. With HIV and thalassaemia casting a shadow over many married lives, we decided that it was our social responsibility to help eradicate the diseases, said Avijeet Mukherjee, president of the Democratic Joint Officers Forum, the organisation of marriage and special marriage registrars. 

 Although the government is making efforts, the diseases are spreading rapidly. So we decided to do something immediately as delays may only result in the birth of more patients, Mukherjee added.

 According to statistics available with the marriage registrars forum, four out of every 100 married couples are turning out to be thalassaemia-positive. There is no official statistics given to us from the government, but we on our own have started to look into the issue very closely, said a member of the body. 

 Priests from Halisahar in North 24-Parganas have decided to join hands with the marriage registrars. This may mean loss of business to us... but we are thinking about the greater cause, said Nitai Haldar.

 According to statistics collected from the state health department, nearly 62,000 children are suffering from thalassaemia and nearly 42,000 patients have to undergo blood transfusion at regular intervals in government hospitals.

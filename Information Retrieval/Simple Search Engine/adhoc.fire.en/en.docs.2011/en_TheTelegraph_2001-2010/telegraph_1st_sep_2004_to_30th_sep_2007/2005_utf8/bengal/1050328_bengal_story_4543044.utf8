 Data on women at one knock

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 26: Information on self-employment schemes for women in the state, names of NGOs working for distressed women or figures on sex ratio and maternal mortality would soon be available under one roof.

 The government is set to launch the West Bengal Women Resource Centre mid-April. 

 ?A National Women Resource Centre under the Union government was launched on March 8, the International Women?s Day. Delhi sent us instructions to open a similar body here,? social welfare secretary S.. Haque said today. 

 The state centre would collect, collate and disseminate information and data relating to welfare, development and empowerment of women.

 It would be a new wing under the social welfare directorate housed at the juvenile court building in Salt Lake. 

 ?The main job would be to collate information and store it. Anyone ? women in need of contact numbers or addresses of NGOs or homes, or researchers looking for figures ?will benefit,? said a social welfare official. 

 There would be provisions for research on women?s issues. ?The centre might also organise studies through universities and other academic institutions or NGOs,? the official added.

 Three women officers would be offered charge of the resource centre ? a social worker, a research officer and an assistant director.

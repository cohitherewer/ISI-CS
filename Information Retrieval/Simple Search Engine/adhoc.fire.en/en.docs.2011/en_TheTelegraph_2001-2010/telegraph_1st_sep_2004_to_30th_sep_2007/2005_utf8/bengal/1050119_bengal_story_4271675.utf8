 Development first, says CM

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 18: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today virtually countered the attack unleashed on him by a section of his own party for an alleged bias towards the city and for being soft on mayor Subrata Mukherjee.

 On the last day of the CPM?s Calcutta district committee conference, the chief minister asked members to submit in writing their criticism of his government so that he could send them across to the departments concerned.

 Several district committee leaders criticised Bhattacharjee over the past two days on two counts ? one, that he was only interested in the city?s development, which ?benefits the affluent?, and, two, he has been heaping praise on the mayor. At the reopening of Star theatre last year, the chief minister had said the Trinamul Congress civic body under Mukherjee had done what his government could not.

 Today, Bhattacharjee said: ?Wipro chief Azim Premji has given certain proposals that will immensely benefit students of Jadavpur and Calcutta University and help us develop the infotech sector. Just tell me whether I should accept this proposal or refuse? If you tell me not to, I will refuse...? 

 Insiders said the district committee members fell silent. 

 The chief minister also told party colleagues that the government?s primary concern was development, not politics. ?We should rise above petty politics so far as development is concerned? For Calcutta?s development, my government is ready to cooperate with anybody, irrespective of his or her party.? 

 He is also learnt to have told the conference that Calcutta is the gateway to south-east Asia and the government is keen to exploit the state?s favourable geographical location. ?Our government is committed to development, but we are also committed to the uplift of the poor in the city,? he is learnt to have said. 

 Bhattacharjee also sought specific suggestions from the party on ways to improve the living condition of the poor.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Sept. 3: A Mahindra Scorpio belonging to a relative of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was stolen last night from a housing complex on Diamond Harbour Road. 

 G.S. Sethi, the father-in-law of Singhs nephew Gurdip Singh, owned the vehicle. A formal complaint was lodged with South 24-Parganas police as well as the Calcutta police detective department. A preliminary probe has revealed that a guard saw someone drive out of the buildings parking lot but did not raise his voice thinking it must be a family member.

 Calcutta: Two poachers have been arrested from Canning in South 24-Parganas and a leopard and deer skin seized. A special vigilance cell set up by the forest department nabbed the duo.

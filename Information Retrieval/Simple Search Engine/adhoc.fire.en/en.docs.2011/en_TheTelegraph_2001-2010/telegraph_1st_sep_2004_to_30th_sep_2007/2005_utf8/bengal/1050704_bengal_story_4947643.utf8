 Call for bigger probe into dam scam

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jalpaiguri, July 3: The Congress today demanded a probe into the utilisation of all funds allotted to the Teesta barrage project since 1975 in the wake of the arrest of engineers and irrigation department contractors for allegedly siphoning away Rs 4.5 crore. 

 Eight engineers were picked up on Friday and two others ? Bireshwar Ghosh and Arun Giri ? were arrested from Calcutta and Ghatal in East Midnapore yesterday. 

 Biswaranjan Sarkar, the district Congress president, said: This is just the tip of the iceberg. Corruption is the primary reason why the project is in such pathetic condition. We want the government to set up an inquiry commission at the earliest. 

 The CPM refused comment on the enforcement branch raids that led to the arrests. 

 Complaints lodged by executive engineers Sarbajit Basu Roy Choudhury and S.K. Chatterjee almost seven years ago had mentioned the names of 16 engineers of executive, assistant and sub-assistant ranks, and three construction firms of Siliguri with which the contrators were associated. 

 Both Basu Roy Choudhury and Chatterjee had alleged that the contractors were overpaid for the excavation and lining of the Teesta Jaldhaka Main Canal. They also said that the engineers, especially those involved with the project when the work order was issued and the bills paid ? from 1996 to 97 ? were responsible for inadmissible payment to the agencies.

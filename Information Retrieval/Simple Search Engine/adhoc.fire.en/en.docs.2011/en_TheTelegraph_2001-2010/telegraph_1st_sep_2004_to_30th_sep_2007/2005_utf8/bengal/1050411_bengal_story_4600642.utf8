 Vaccine boycott in exam protest

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, April 10: Parents of about 700 schoolchildren today boycotted the pulse polio programme in Nadia to protest against a decision preventing them from admitting their wards in secondary schools of their choice. 

 Apparently to keep track of dropouts, the district authorities issued a circular last month making it mandatory for students completing the primary level (Class IV) to enrol in secondary schools closest to home and selected by them. 

 A district official said the decision was taken to stem the number of dropouts at the primary level. The circular reached the schools this month.

 The polio programme and could be the children themselves bore the brunt of protest.

 ?The two issues are completely different,? said subdivisional officer, headquarters, Ajay Sannamat. ?Nadia has a large number of dropouts after the primary level. We don?t have any data on where they go after Class IV,? he added. 

 The boycott affected the health drive in Kaligunj, Nakashipara and Karimpur blocks. 

 Health workers rushed to the villages for a door-to-door request. In Khodpalashi, Bonpalashi, Bhagachandpur, Bahirampur and Kamalabati villages in Kaligunj, 140 km from Calcutta, angry residents kept them under siege for hours.

 Kaligunj block medical officer Manas Bhattacharya went to the villages to convince the villagers that polio drops and school admissions were unrelated. But Bhattacharya met with the same fate as the health workers. Along with district immunisation officer Sukanta Sil, he was gheraoed in Khodpalashi. 

 ?I repeatedly tried to tell them that the health department has nothing to do with the decision regarding admission in secondary schools, but they wouldn?t listen. They told me they would not allow their children to be vaccinated against polio till the circular was withdrawn,? said Bhattacharya. 

 The villagers said they were aware that the issues were different, but thought there would be no better day to pressure the administration into a rethink. ?How can we accept the decision? How can they take away our right to enrol our children to schools of our choice?? asked Sunil Ghosh, a trader in Khodpalashi. 

 Ghosh wants to get his son enrolled in the high school at Nagadi which, according to him, is the best in the block. ?Now I would have to enrol my son in a school in my adjacent village, Bhagachandpur.? 

 In Murutia, Karimpur, 190 km from Calcutta, about 350 residents of two villages stayed away from the the drive. 

 Ranapratap Chowdhury, a wealthy farmer of Majlispara whose son is now in Class II, said the administration has snatched away his ?fundamental right? to get his son admitted to a good school.

 CPI pummels front policies

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 16: Following in the footsteps of the rebellious Forward Bloc, the CPI, a major Left Front constituent, today attacked the government?s industrial policy, describing it as ?defective? and unable to generate large-scale employment opportunities. 

 The Bloc, the second largest constituent of the ruling coalition, had earlier criticised the CPM for its decision to issue fresh liquor licences. The party also condemned the CPM for its ?big-brotherly attitude? and taking important decisions unilaterally. 

 ?The Left Front government is not interested in developing traditional industries like jute and small-scale units that are sure to provide jobs to thousands of our unemployed youths. Instead, the government is interested in developing sectors like information technology where the scope of employment is very limited,? said CPI state secretary Manju Kumar Majumdar. 

 He criticised the government, saying it had failed to spread education, provide medical facilities to villagers and carry out development activities in districts. 

 ?Our chief minister himself has admitted that there are more than 4,000 villages which are very poor and we feel that the failure of our government in uplifting the poorer sections in rural Bengal will encourage separatist forces like the CPI (Maoist). These forces are trying to exploit the poor people in villages and strengthen their organisational network,? he added. 

 Majumdar also suggested that the front government invite the separatist forces for talks. ?We want the Maoists to join the mainstream,? he said. 

 The CPM state leadership had categorically stated in the recently concluded state conference that the front government would not invite extremists to the dialogue table until they give up the path of ?so-called armed struggle?. 

 The CPI also differed on the labour movement. ?We don?t discourage the so-called militant trade unionism like the CPM. We want our working class not to give up the right to strike. At the same time, we are not opposing the proposals for development of the state. 

 ?The Left Front is described as a tool of struggle in the hands of the working class and poorer sections of the society. But sometimes, we feel that we are deviating from our ideological viewpoint,? Majumdar said.

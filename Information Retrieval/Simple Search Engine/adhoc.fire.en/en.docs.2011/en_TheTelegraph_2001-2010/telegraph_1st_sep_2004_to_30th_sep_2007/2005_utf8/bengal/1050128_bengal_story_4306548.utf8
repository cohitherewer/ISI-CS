 Mixed marriage anger explodes

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Purulia, Jan. 27: Resentment over the marriage of a Santhal girl to a Bengali three years ago erupted after an alcoholic binge at a tribal festival and drove a group to beat the man to death. 

 Manas Das, a 34-year-old entrepreneur, was battered on January 15 and then his body was apparently burnt to remove evidence. 

 Purulia superintendent of police R. Shiv Kumar said one person has been arrested. ?The man has confessed that he along with the others burnt the body of Manas because they wanted to wipe off evidence. We are looking for several others,? he added. 

 Das had set up a piggery at Kenduberia, about 240 km from Calcutta, six years ago. Sumita Murmu, a 25-year-old Santhal who lived in the adjacent village of Jibanpur, used to work in the farm. They fell in love and married against the wishes of their families. The couple has a two-year-old child. 

 Sumita was disowned by the Santhal community and lived with Das on the farm. Das? family at Muradi, about seven km away, also refused to accept the marriage.

 On January 15, a group of tribals drank through the day during Dhadna, a festival at the adjacent Dubrajpur village. Around 9 pm, Santhal youths came to the farm and took Das to the mela. 

 As it was getting late, Sumita went to look for him. She reached and found to Das was being assaulted, and protested. She was threatened and forced to return to the farm. 

 Das did not come home but fear kept her quiet for four days. Finally, she went to her estranged father-in-law and narrated the incident. A complaint was lodged with Santuri police station. 

 ?I saw the killers with my own eyes. If need be, I will identify them,? said Sumita. 

 Passions fanned by the incident are still burning. Mongol Hembrom, a Santhal from Sumita?s village, said: ?Sumita had not done the right thing by marrying a Bengali youth.? 

 On January 23, Das? uncle Tapan Sarkar and three others turned up at Jibanpur to find out the truth. Angry tribals tied them up to a tree and started dancing round them beating their drums. 

 As tribals from nearby villages started gathering with bows and arrows, a villager, Dinabandhu Mondal, informed the police fearing for their lives. The police rescued the four.

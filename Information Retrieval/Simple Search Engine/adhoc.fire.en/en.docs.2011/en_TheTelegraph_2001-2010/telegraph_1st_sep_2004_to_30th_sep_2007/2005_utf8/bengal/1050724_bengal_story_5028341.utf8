 Forum push to IT players

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 23: Offices in the US, UK and Singapore in the next three months, a trip to the US with a business delegation in early 2006, representation at major exhibitions and fairs ? Bengal Infotech Entrepreneurs Syndicate (BITS) is set to usher in the next round of growth in the states knowledge economy.

 The objective of the forum is to bring all IT and ITES entrepreneurs in the state under one roof, identify their core competencies and create a global platform for them to grow. We should be a global delivery place and achievement of that objective will take us to the next level, said Bikram Dasgupta of Globsyn, one of the core committee members of the outfit that promises to be different from other industry associations.

 BITS was formally launched today at a function attended by local IT entrepreneurs and government representatives.

 According to Dasgupta, creation of wealth would be critical in the next stage of growth and BITS ? billed as an association of and by IT entrepreneurs ? aims at empowering local entrepreneurs to compete at global levels and increase their share in the IT pie.

 To keep action as its agenda, BITS has started with a flat structure of a five-member core committee. Besides Dasgupta, the members are S. Radhakrishnan of Descon, S.P. Mukherjee of Databazar.com, Dilip Chatterjee of JDS Technologies and Sourabh Sarkar of Aesthetic Technologies.

 Given the response we have had from local entrepreneurs, we think the number will surely increase. We will also offer associate membership to CEOs and executives of companies that have operations here, said Dasgupta, adding that the focus will be on the forum and not on individual companies.

 From mentoring young entrepreneurs to helping companies get quality certification and taking up issues facing the industry with the government to facilitating flow of funds from venture capitalists, a host of promises were made by the BITS core committee during the launch.

 The association is looking for 120-plus members, who will work hand-in-hand and benefit from each others competencies.

 To ensure its presence on the national scene and lobby the central government on various policy issues, the city-based association is tying up with Nasscom, the apex body of IT companies. 

 The state government has been supportive of the initiative. This is a unique endeavour and we want to utilise this opportunity to work closely with the local IT companies. We plan to hold at least one meeting every month with BITS members, where we will try to resolve problems faced by them, said G.D. Gautama, principal secretary, IT.

 CU revamp on track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 11: A restructuring of Calcutta Universitys three-year undergraduate courses is on its way.

 The proposal of the West Bengal Higher Education Council (WBHEC) to introduce the 1+1+1 scheme ? Part-I covers two years and Part-II the third year under the current system ? has been accepted in principle by the university. 

 Preparations are on for implementing the new pattern, officials said.

 The university has no objection to introducing the new scheme. But we will be in a position to make the final announcement only after we discuss the issue with principals, teachers and, above all, the students of our affiliated colleges, Suranjan Das, pro vice-chancellor, academic affairs, said after the final round of meetings of a committee set up to examine the proposal.

 The WBHEC, the apex body that frames all major policies of the government regarding higher education, had recommended CU and all other state-aided universities last year to introduce the proposed pattern, which has been adopted in many other states.

 The CU committee today decided to prepare a report on deliberations of the several meetings held since last month. The report will be discussed with heads of undergraduate colleges, teachers and students. D.J. Chattopadhyay, dean of science, has been asked to prepare it.

 Before implementing the scheme, the university will decide on distributing the syllabi and fixing pass marks. We are going to take the opinions of all concerned, Das said.

 The university will organise workshops, likely to be held in mid-June. Along with principals and teachers, students will be asked to attend the workshops. The courses, after all, are meant for our students. We do not want them to be inconvenienced, Das said. 

 Once the workshops are over, the proceedings will be placed before the undergraduate council of the university.

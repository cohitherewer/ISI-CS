 Patient in chains

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, Aug. 3: An AIDS patient was chained to his bed at Barasat district hospital this morning, sparking an uproar.

 Residents accompanied by members of an NGO demonstrated in front of the hospital and demanded that Amiya Debnath (name changed on request) be freed. 

 A complaint was also lodged at Barasat police station against the superintendent of the hospital, S.K. Saha, charging him with misbehaviour with the patient.

 Saha, however, said Debnath, who would turn violent, was brought to the hospital in chains by his relatives. We have treated him, given him medicines to cool him down and we unlocked the chains today, he added.

 We found it very difficult to control him and so we had to administer strong doses of sedatives and psychiatric medicines, said the chief medical officer of health, North 24-Parganas, K. Adhikary.

 District magistrate Manoj Pant said he has ordered the hospital authorities to ensure proper treatment of Debnath. A medical team has been sent to his village (Bagda) to spread awareness among the people so that he is accepted there after being released from hospital, he said.

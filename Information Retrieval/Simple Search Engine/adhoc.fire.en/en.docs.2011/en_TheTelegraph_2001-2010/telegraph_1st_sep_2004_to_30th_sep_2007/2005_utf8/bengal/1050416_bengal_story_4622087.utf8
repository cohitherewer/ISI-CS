 Govt hints at hotel ERS extension

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 15: The government today indicated that it might extend by a month the early retirement scheme deadline issued to Great Eastern Hotel employees.

 Citu state president Shyamal Chakraborty had written to the government asking for a month?s time on behalf of employees. ?(The) employees need time to understand the implications of the offer. We?ve received reports that several employees from all unions are interested in the ERS offer, but are being prevented by union leaders. We want to give them enough time to accept the offer. The government should take all measures to ensure that they can avail of the scheme.? 

 He added that both commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen and tourism minister Dinesh Dakua had agreed to his extension proposal. Dakua said before extending the scheme, his department would take into account the mood of the employees. ?We cannot go on giving indefinite extensions.?

 The government had extended the March 26 deadline after not receiving a single application. Ten employees out of over 400 have picked up the forms yet. 

 Dakua said: ?Ten shortlisted firms will make site visits to the hotel soon?

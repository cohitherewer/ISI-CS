 Forward Bloc feud simmers

 OUR BUREAU

 Jan. 16: Three days after being told to put in her papers, former agricultural marketing minister Chhaya Ghosh took on the Forward Bloc leadership for its ?unilateral decision?. 

 In Behrampore, she broke her silence since her resignation, saying: ?The (Bloc) state secretariat?s decision to remove me goes against the basics of our organisation. The state committee should have been taken into confidence before such a drastic action against me. The move is aimed at placating leaders like Kamal Guha (the agriculture minister), who have been eyeing my department as it earns substantial revenues these days.? 

 Ghosh, also the Bloc?s Murshidabad secretary, told party workers: ?I am a victim of a deep-rooted conspiracy.? 

 Jayanta Roy, the lone Bloc secretariat member who was opposed to Ghosh?s removal, accompanied her. 

 State Bloc secretary Ashok Ghosh said in Calcutta the party did not violate norms by asking Ghosh to resign. ?Chhaya has been charged with violating party discipline and the secretariat, our highest decision-making body, had every right to act against her. ?

 Minister for relief Hafiz Ali Sairani, a Bloc secretariat member, said: ?She was warned time and again against anti-party activities. She had to pay the price for her own fault.?

 Ghosh, however, urged supporters to get ready for a ?bigger movement? against her party?s ?pre-planned attack?.

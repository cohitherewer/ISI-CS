 Axe hangs on Congress trio

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 4: The Congress will showcause three party MLAs from Murshidabad, including Atish Sinha, its legislature party leader, for boycotting yesterdays Sahid Minar rally against Adhir Chowdhurys arrest.

 Mayarani Paul and Niamat Sheikh, MLAs from Behrampore and Hariharpara, are the others on the list. 

 The three of them will be asked why disciplinary action should not be taken against them for skipping the rally, defence minister and state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee told key party functionaries before leaving for Delhi yesterday. The trio will get a week to reply to the notice.

 Party working president Pradip Bhattacharya said they deserve stern punishment. Pranabda has been authorised to take the decision. 

 General secretary Shankar Singh demanded that they be expelled from the party. They are the black sheep and are helping the CPM weaken our organisation, he said. 

 However, Sinha, whose strained relationship with Chowdhury, the Behrampore MP, is public knowledge, said he is ready with a reply to the notice. I shall tell the leadership that it is wrong to rally behind a criminal who is not only involved in a double murder but has worked against the organisation since being made the district president, he added. 

 Chowdhury had replaced Sinha as the partys top functionary in Murshidabad in 2001.

 Sinha threatened a split in the Congress if attempts were made to target me and my loyalists. An eight-time MLA from Kandi in Murshidabad, he said: I would have attended the rally if it were organised to expose the CPMs misrule.

 Pauls son Utpal, a Youth Congress vice-president, said she skipped the rally as a mark of protest. Sheikh was not available for comment.

 Keen to outdo the faction-ridden Congress, Mamata Banerjee announced a grand procession from Esplanade to Park Circus tomorrow demanding free and fair polls in 2006.

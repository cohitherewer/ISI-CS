 Math head resigns over recruitment

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 Calcutta, Jan. 15: K.C. Das, the head of the mathematics department of Jadavpur University, resigned yesterday following a difference of opinion with some members of a selection committee set up to recruit lecturers in November.

 This is the first time a head of a department of the university has quit under such circumstances. 

 In his letter to vice-chancellor A.N. Basu yesterday, Das said: ?As a mathematician, I have no doubt that the selections have been totally unfair, miserably sub-standard and hopelessly unsuitable for a university with five-star status. I cannot reconcile my conscience to hold on to the very insignificant post of a titular head of the department and remain a mute spectator to such damages being done to the department in the name of selection...?

 Basu refused comment. 

 Trouble started when the selection committee was split down the middle over preparing the panel to fill up five posts of mathematics lecturer. 

 Das and three others had opposed the selection of the other four on the ground that the person chosen at the top of the panel was less qualified than others. 

 The separate panel submitted by Das? group was rejected by the executive council.

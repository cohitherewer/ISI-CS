 Killer rapist arrested

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Feb. 26: Police today arrested Nantu Roy in connection with the rape and murder of a schoolgirl near here a fortnight ago.

 Nantu, who had gone missing since the killing on February 11, was arrested from a hideout near Hanskhali, about 75 km from Calcutta.

 Nantu had taken the girl, Prabhati, to a house to see a video film. The girl did not return and her body was found by some children the next morning floating in a pond near her house at Bhanderkhola in Nadia.

 The accused said he killed Prabhati, after raping her, as she had threatened to tell her parents and other residents of the area.

 ?From his statement and our investigation, it is now very clear that Nantu raped the girl and later murdered her to protect himself,? said the additional police superintendent, Biswarup Ghosh.

 The accused was reportedly close to the girl?s family.

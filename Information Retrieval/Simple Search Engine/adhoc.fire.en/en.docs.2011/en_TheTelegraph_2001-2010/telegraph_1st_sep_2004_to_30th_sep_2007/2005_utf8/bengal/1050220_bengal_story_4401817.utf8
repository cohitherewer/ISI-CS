 Police bid to skirt killer role 

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, Feb. 19: Witnesses may insist that 

a police vehicle ran over 26-year-old Rajesh Mahato last night, but the men in 

uniform would not agree.

 They said a speeding Maruti car could be the killer in front of New Market police station.

 Changing the statement issued last night, immediately after Mahato?s death, a senior officer said an effort has been initiated to identify the Maruti that probably knocked down Mahato on S.N. Banerjee Road. 

 Senior officers, who rushed to control the mob fury triggered by the accident, however, admitted that a police pick-up van was coming down the wrong way of the road at the time of the incident. 

 ?At the same time, the Maruti car was also passing through the road. The accident could be an act of the car also,? said Naparajit Mukherjee, an additional commissioner of police.

 Under pressure from local people who alleged that Mahato was run over by a police vehicle, an inquiry has been ordered. Zulfiquar Hassan, the joint commissioner of armed police who was among the officers trying to rein in the mob last night, said: ?It is a fact that the police vehicle was heading towards the east, which is a violation of traffic rules. Vehicles on S.N. Banerjee Road ply from east to west. If the police van is identified and it is found that it hit Mahato, lawful action will be initiated.? 

 According to the police, the mishap occurred around 11.15 pm. ?After closing the small paan shop adjacent to the police station building, Mahato ? from Samastipur in Bihar ? stepped on the road and was hit by a police van from behind almost immediately,? said Suresh Nath, a resident. ?He knew it was one-way and so did not look towards the west. We rushed him to Calcutta Medical College and Hospital, where doctors declared him dead.?

 As the news of Mahato?s death spread, local people assembled in front of the police station. ?They turned violent when they came to know that the killer vehicle was a police van. They damaged two police vehicles and pelted stones at the policemen. We had little to do because we were outnumbered. Twelve policemen were injured and two of them had to be hospitalised,? said an official.

 Though the spot is only a five-minute drive from the Lalbazar police headquarters, reinforcement arrived around 12 midnight, more than half-an-hour after the incident. ?As the people were brickbatting, we first charged tear-gas shells to disperse them. When it did not work, we fired three rounds in the air. Six people were arrested,? said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner (central).

 ?If the police van is identified as the killer vehicle, there is a provision for compensation (to the victim?s family). We will talk to DC (traffic) Arun Kumar Sharma about it,? said Hassan.

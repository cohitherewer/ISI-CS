 Stress at work, strife at home

 RAVIK BHATTACHARJEE

 Calcutta, Nov. 5: For a senior officer of Calcutta police, Section 144 awaits him at home. Tired of her husband staying away for work for 18 hours at a stretch, the officers wife and the rest of his family have stopped speaking to him. 

 He is one of the many in the force who are facing war on the home front because of their long work schedules during the festive season. 

 The baro babus (officers-in-charge), too, are at the edge of their physical and mental strength. Most are suffering from backache, hypertension and respiratory problems apart from ailments arising from sleep disorder. 

 As the people made merry, the officers were made to work round the clock, manning roads or staying put at their police station. 

 We understand that it has been very hectic for officers and personnel of our force during the past month. However, the toil comes with the job and we all have to do it. Leaves were cancelled till November 7 because of the festivities. There was also an alert issued and our personnel kept strict vigil, said Anuj Sharma, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 For an officer-in-charge (OC) of a police station near Esplanade, it was a season of loneliness. He stayed at the quarters next to the police station while his wife and two children were in Jadavpur. I have met my family members only once this season. My area is crime-prone and it is necessary for me to stay near my station. Sometimes I go and meet them. But I have been so busy that I cant make it too often. My heart cries for them, but duty is duty, he said.

 Apart from hurting family life, the season has taken its toll on the officers health. After the days duty, we have to spend many a sleepless night keeping vigil on the streets and overlooking security arrangements during the immersion of idols. I am down with backache and fever but have to attend duty, said an officer in north Calcutta. 

 For his colleague at Bowbazar police station, the mobile phone has been his lifeline. The hectic activities come with the job. However, my wife and children know this and they understand why I am not with them during the pujas. When I feel sad and lonely, I send SMS to my family members and relatives, apart from talking to them from time to time, said Gadai Dey.

 However, not all can afford to be so accommodating. My only son is mentally disabled and he needs special care, along with my presence. I feel sad that in the past few months, I have not been able to give him time. I am a patient of asthma and not doing too well. But I dont want to take sick leave as that will spoil my career record, said another OC.

 GNLF calls off three-day bandh

 OUR BUREAU

 Darjeeling/Siliguri, March 12: The Gorkha National Liberation Front today withdrew its proposed three-day strike beginning on March 16, saying the state government had sent ?positive signals? that it would make party chief Subash Ghisingh the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council caretaker after the panel?s term ends on March 25.

 The decision to call off the 72-hour bandh ? the first phase of an agitation that the GNLF had threatened to extend to 91 days in the next four months ? was taken during the party?s central committee meeting in Darjeeling today.

 ?We have decided to withdraw the 72-hour bandh from March 16 to honour chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s request to me over phone. However, the rest of the scheduled strikes are still on,? Ghisingh said.

 ?Our demand is for an alternative to the present council and this could be anything the state and the Centre can offer us,? Ghisingh said, welcoming the scheduled meeting between the chief minister and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on March 19. However, the GNLF chief said he would not meet Bhattacharjee, currently touring north Bengal.

 The GNLF leader said other ?strikes could even be more prolonged? if the party?s demand is not met.

 Ghisingh today said the government had made a provision to safeguard ?the caretaker power of the general council?, though the DGHC amendment bill to be tabled in the Assembly on Monday speaks of appointing an administrator or a board of administrators.

 The GNLF even pasted posters in Darjeeling saying the government has decided to make Ghisingh a ?caretaker? of the council.

 But parties opposed to the GNLF said Ghisingh?s ambiguous stand on the amendment is a ploy to enable it to withdraw the three-day strike in the face of stiff resistance from the people of the hills.

 ?The amendment is clear and there is no mention of Ghisingh being made caretaker. Ghisingh?s claim is only a face-saver,? said Sawan Rai, convenor of the five-party People?s Democratic Front that has a seat-sharing arrangement with the CPM.

 At Siliguri, urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya also said at a news conference that the real reason behind Ghisingh?s withdrawal of the 72-hour bandh was pressure from people of the region.

 The minister referred to yesterday?s meeting in Darjeeling where people voiced their protest against the proposed bandh. ?It was this common man?s pressure that made Ghisingh realise that people are unhappy with him.?

 ?Ghisingh?s idea of politics is only blackmailing the state government. He has been in power so far using blackmailing tactics and wants to continue doing the same,? alleged Bhattacharya.

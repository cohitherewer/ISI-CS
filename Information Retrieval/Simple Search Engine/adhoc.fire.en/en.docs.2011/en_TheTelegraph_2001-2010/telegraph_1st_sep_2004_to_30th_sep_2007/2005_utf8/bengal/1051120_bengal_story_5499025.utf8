 Bandh to protest arrest

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Behrampore, Nov. 19: The Congress has called a 12-hour bandh in the Murshidabad and Nadia districts tomorrow to begin its statewide agitation against the arrest of party MP Adhir Chowdhury.

 We shall observe a black day tomorrow and further intensify our agitation in the coming days to protest against the ruling CPMs conspiracy to malign the Congress in the run-up to next years Assembly polls, said PCC working president Pradip Bhattacharya.

 He alleged that Chowdhury and his wife Arpita were falsely implicated in a case of twin murders that took place in Behrampore on July 23. This is a deep-rooted conspiracy as neither Chowdhury nor his wife was named in the FIR, he said.

 Bhattacharya, who discussed the future course of action with PCC chief Pranab Mukherjee, said the party would organise a protest meeting at Sahid Minar on December 3. Mukherjee and other key party functionaries will address the gathering.

 Party workers demonstrated in the city and across the state after the Behrampore MP was picked up from his New Delhi residence.

 Chowdhurys supporters held demonstrations in front of the block development offices in 26 blocks of Murshidabad. They blocked National Highway 34 and state highways at several points to protest against the arrest.

 A bandh-like situation prevailed in Behrampore as slogan-shouting Congress workers laid siege to the town. 

 Senior officials, including deputy inspector general of police Debashish Roy, are supervising security arrangements.

 Murshidabad superintendent of police Neeraj Kumar Singh said Chowdhury would be produced in the subdivisional magistrates court either tomorrow or the day after.

 Chowdhury was taken to Behrampore tonight by car under tight security after he landed at Calcutta airport.

 In Calcutta, Congress supporters blocked road intersections to protest against the arrest. Police arrested 33 Congress supporters demonstrating in front of Writers Buildings.

 Youth Congress president Tapan Agarwal said they would organise a sit-in at Esplanade tomorrow.

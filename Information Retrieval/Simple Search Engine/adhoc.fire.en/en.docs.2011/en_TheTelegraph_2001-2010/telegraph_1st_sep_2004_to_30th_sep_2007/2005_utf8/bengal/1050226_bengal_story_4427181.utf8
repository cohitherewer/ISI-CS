 Thrashing for a handful of biscuits

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Feb. 25: Little Munni had to pay with a bruised body for cream-crackers she should not have had.

 The 10-year-old domestic help, who could not resist the crispy squares so out of bounds, was thrashed last night by many much older than her for digging into a tin reserved for her master?s son.

 Raja Mukherjee, a suspended police officer, his wife and relatives took turns to punish Munni at Panskura, about 160 km from Calcutta. 

 To cover up the wounds, Mukherjee forced her into an oversized panjabi. He took her on his motorcycle and dropped her at Sarberia, about 70 km away, where her mother Kakoli Singh lived. 

 It did not take Kakoli long to realise what happened as Munni started weeping. The scars were apparent. She rushed with her daughter to a health centre, where she had to be admitted.

 Kakoli has lodged an FIR at the Chandrakona Road police outpost alleging that Mukherjee and his wife beat her up often. A. Dey, a doctor attached to the health centre, said she has several injuries and ?may have to be referred to Midnapore Medical College and Hospital?. The girl, he added, is fainting frequently.

 Dibyendu Das, the inspector-in-charge of the police outpost, confirmed the ?torture? charge but declined comment. 

 Mukherjee was posted at the same outpost before being dropped in connection with a dacoity. After suspension, he shifted to his in-laws? and took Munni along. He denied having beaten her. ?My wife slapped her after she stole my son?s biscuits... she fell and got injured.?

 Court fines director of education

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 13: The high court today came down heavily on the director of school education (DSE) for not complying with its order asking him to approve the appointment of the son of a teacher in a North Dinajpur school who died in harness.

 Justice Pronab Kumar Chattopadhyay directed the DSE to pay Rs 9,000 to the petitioner, Budhan Burman, for the expenses incurred in litigation and asked the chairman of the North Dinajpur primary school council to appoint him as a teacher of Kunar Primary School within 10 days. 

 The DSE is, hereby, directed to approve the said appointment, the judge said.

 There is a clear provision in law that the next of kin of a person who dies in harness will have to be given appointment if the person concerned dies at an early age. Here Meena Rani was only 38 years when she died and his son has the right to get the job, he added.

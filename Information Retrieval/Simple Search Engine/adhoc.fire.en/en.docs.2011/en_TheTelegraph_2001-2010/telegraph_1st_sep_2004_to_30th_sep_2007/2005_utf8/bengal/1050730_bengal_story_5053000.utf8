 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, July 29: The high court today directed the state electricity board to pay Rs 5,000 each to two farmers of Murshidabad for its failure to provide connections even after receiving the deposits about a year ago. The court said the power utility had no authority to take the money if it was not capable of providing the connections on time. 

 Calcutta: Subhasish Sinha and his parents, sentenced to life earlier for pushing his wife to suicide, have been acquitted by the high court. In 1990, Smriti, a housewife in Hooghly, set herself afire with her daughter.

 Calcutta, April 2: As the Pope continued to battle death in Rome, prayers poured in from various corners of the city through the day for his recovery. 

 Around 6 am, a special mass was held at the headquarters of the Missionaries of Charity on Ripon Street where Sister Nirmala led the prayers for Pope John Paul II. 

 From 8.30, prayers were held every hour at the prayer hall on the first floor of Mother House. Outside, on the corridor leading to the hall, the sole wish was spelt out. ?All our prayers and work today we offer for our dearest Holy Father,? said the message scribbled on a blackboard. 

 At the other end, a small board urged visitors to join the prayers. ?Please pray for our dearest Holy Father.? 

 Sister Christie of the Missionaries of Charity said: ?Our regular prayers are meant for the wellbeing of all but, when someone is in crisis, we dedicate the prayers for him. Today, it is for Holy Father.?

 Inside the prayer hall, as the sisters prayed, a notice on the blackboard kept updating the condition of the Pope. 

 Around 4 pm, the board read: ?Holy Father in Coma.? 

 Around the same time as the special mass at the Missionaries of Charity, school students and many others had their hands clasped in prayer at St Teresa of Avila Church. 

 Archbishop Lucas Sikdar was not in the city. In Bandel, he joined others in prayer. 

 Earlier, all Roman catholic churches and chapels ? some 40-odd in the city ? were asked to organise special prayers. ?The faithful have been asked to come together and offer prayers for the Holy Father. We are still hopeful but, in case of his death, there will be a nine-day official mourning, during which these institutions would be holding special sessions on the life and work of Holy Father,? said Fr Michael Bhaju, the vicar-general of the Calcutta archdiocese. 

 In the evening, the Calcutta Catholic Charismatic Renewal Services held a special service at a church in Dharmotolla. ?It?s all for him,? said Fr C.J. Sebastian.

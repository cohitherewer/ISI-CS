 Principal?s turn to get the stick 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Behrampore, Feb. 9: Rathin Biswas, principal of a college in Beldanga and brother-in-law of civil defence minister Srikumar Mukherjee, has been suspended for absenteeism. 

 Biswas? long absence affected disbursement of salary and held up examinations and election to the college council. 

 The state-aided college?s governing body took the decision at a meeting chaired by Murshidabad district magistrate N. Manjunatha Prasad, also president of the body. Mohammad Muslehuddin, a senior lecturer, has been appointed acting principal. 

 Beldanga Siunarayan Rameswar Fatehpuria College was established 40 years ago and has 1,500 students on its roll. Biswas, who joined as a lecturer about 20 years ago, rose to the top post in 2000. 

 Prasad said Biswas stopped attending college from October 14 last year without notice. Teachers and non-teaching employees have not got salaries for the past two months as he was the drawing and disbursement officer. Scheduled elections to the college union and Part I and Part II test examinations could not be held. 

 Biswas, who was served a showcause notice 10 days ago, replied that he was not being ?allowed to work? but did not name anybody. Nor did he lodge an FIR against them. 

 Biswas could not be contacted, but his wife said: ?He is due to retire after a month-and-a-half. He stopped going to the college after submitting a leave application, but the governing body cancelled his leave without any reason.? 

 Minister Mukherjee expressed surprise at the development when contacted.

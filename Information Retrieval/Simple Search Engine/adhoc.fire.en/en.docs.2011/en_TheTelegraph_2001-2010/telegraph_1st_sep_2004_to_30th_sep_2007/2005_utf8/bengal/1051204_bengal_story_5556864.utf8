 Calcutta, Dec. 3: Bela 

 Bose, the prime accused in the murder of Rick Nath, suffered 

 from a serious psychological disorder, for which 

 she was being treated, police said today.

 Bela, around 50 years old, was torched to death by a mob late on Thursday night after the boys body was found in a septic tank of her house on Sadhan Hari Mukherjee Road, off Behalas James Long Sarani.

 Describing her mental state as akin to that of a psychopath, S.N. Gupta, the South 24-Parganas superintendent of police, said Bela had a sinister and cruel streak. 

 This condition can lead a person to commit a heinous crime like murdering the five-year-old boy. But in this particular case, given the nature of the crime, there was a second person involved and we are on the lookout for that person, he said.

 The police added that only one person was responsible for setting Bela and her husband ablaze. He sprinkled kerosene on the two and set them on fire. We are trying to get him, Gupta said. 

 Rick had gone to Belas house before he went missing on Thursday. Almost 14 hours later, local residents traced his body to a septic tank of the Boses residence.

 Soon after, an enraged mob ransacked the two-room house and dragged out Bela, Rabindra Nath and their son Kaushik. They thrashed the three before setting Bela and Rabindra Nath on fire.

 The police said they are still not clear about the motive of the murder, but it appears to have been planned, and Bela ? whom Rick used to fondly call Biral Dida (Cat Granny) ? played a pivotal role in it.

 The police are digging out details of a dispute between the two families over a boundary wall separating the Boses house from a temple built by Ricks family.

 They are also probing why Bela did not go to office on Thursday although she was not ill. Bela would be the last one in the family to leave for her Buroshibtala office around 10.30 am. It is not clear why she stayed back on Thursday, said a senior officer of Behala police station.

 We have gathered enough evidence to establish that Bela was involved in the crime, Gupta said.

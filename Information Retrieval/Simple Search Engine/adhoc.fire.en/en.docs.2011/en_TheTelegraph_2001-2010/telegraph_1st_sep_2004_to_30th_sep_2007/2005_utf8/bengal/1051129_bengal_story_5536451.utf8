 Balurghat, Nov, 28: The district court today finally granted bail to former minister Narayan Biswas and the CPMs South Dinajpur secretary, Manabesh Chowdhury. 

 Chowdhury had surren- dered in the court on October 24 and was followed by Biswas on November 2. Both were remanded in judicial custody and had been staying at the district jail since.

 Chowdhury broke down after his bail prayer was granted. I had been implicated in a false case and I was jailed for no fault of mine. The experience has opened my eyes... he said later.

 Biswas, who had to quit as the minister of state for cottage and small-scale industries under pressure from the chief minister, was composed. It is good that eight of us have got bail, but it would have been better if our other comrades were also released, he said. 

 Six other party members, accused in various cases of political violence, were also released today.

 South Dinajpur Trinamul Congress president Biplab Mitra said: Everyone expected them to get bail some day, but we have been able to prove that nobody is above the law.

 The two leaders along with other undertrials were brought to the court premises in a van and were seated in the court inspectors office. 

 Biswas had been hauled up in connection with an incident in 1988 in which 22 houses were torched at Ratanpur in Gangarampur subdivision. 

 The former minister was also accused of setting fire to a paddy field at Kestopur in the same area in 1979. He was granted bail in both cases.

 Chowdhury was accused of involvement in an attack on the residence of Biplab Mitra in 1983. Mitra was then a Congress leader. 

 The two will have to appear in court for the next hearing on December 22 and 23.

 When the court proceedings began this morning, there were not many people in the courtroom. But once the news of the bail being granted spread, hundreds of supporters converged on the premises.

 Minati Ghosh, the CPM leader in charge of its South Dinajpur unit, however, ruled out a victory rally with the two leaders. 

 The district CPM leadership had been virtually rendered headless with two of its top leaders behind bars.

 Biswas was earlier denied bail by the same court on November 14 and remanded in a fortnights jail custody.

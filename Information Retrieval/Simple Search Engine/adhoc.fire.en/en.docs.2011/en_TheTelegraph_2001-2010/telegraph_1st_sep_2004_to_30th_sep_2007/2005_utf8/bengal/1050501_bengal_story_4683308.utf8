 Miffed Adhir jolts Cong

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, April 30: The faction-ridden state Congress today received a jolt with Behrampore MP Adhir Chowdhury declaring that he would not campaign for party candidates of Kandi municipality.

 Chowdhury said he would campaign for Independent candidates during the forthcoming civic elections.

 Chowdhury alleged that though state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee had asked him to give tickets to 11 candidates, including eight former councillors in Kandi municipality, local MLA Atish Sinha refused to accept this.

 ?I will not back Congress nominees as seven aspiring candidates, including the chairman and vice-chairman of the former municipality, were denied party tickets. I felt humiliated at being sidelined. Now I have decided to attend a citizens? convention at Kandi in support of Independent candidates,? Chowdhury said.

 The MP vented his ire over the manner in which Sinha is finalising the list of candidates. ?The state Congress committee has asked Sinha to choose nominees for the Kandi municipality. But he has misused his power by denying tickets to former Congress members of the municipality,? he said. 

 However, Chowdhury will support Congress candidates for the neighbouring Beldanga municipality that falls under his Behrampore parliamentary constituency.

 Sinha, when contacted in Calcutta, rubbished Chowdhury?s allegations. ?I was deputed to select the candidates and have done the job properly. Some Congress candidates were denied tickets as they had refused to contest from wards other than their old ones,? he said.

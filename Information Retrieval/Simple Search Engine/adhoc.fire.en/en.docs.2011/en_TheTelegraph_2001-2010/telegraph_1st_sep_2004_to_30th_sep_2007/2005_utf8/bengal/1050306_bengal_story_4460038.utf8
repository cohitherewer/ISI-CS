 Sick of space jam, museum takes spat to Centre

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 The Indian Museum

 Calcutta, March 5: Locked in a row over space for more than a decade, the Indian Museum has asked the Centre to intervene. 

 Three Survey of India offices have been occupying 8,844 square metres on the museum?s premises for the last 12 years, making it difficult for all collections to be displayed, museum authorities said. At present, the museum has 17,457 square metres where only about 4,000 exhibits ? 4 per cent of the total collection ? have found space.

 The authorities recently knocked on the doors of the department of culture in the Union government and urged it to take some measures to evict the offices.

 The Zoological Survey of India occupies 3481.21 square metres, the Anthropological Survey of India 2485.68 square metres, while the Botanical Survey of India has taken up 2878 square metres of the museum?s space.

 Twelve years ago, a review committee had been set up by the museum authorities to find a remedy for the space crunch. It was agreed that an additional 15,000 square metres would be required to display the museum?s entire collection.

 But the authorities have yet to sort out the problem. 

 The Botanical Survey of India has denied using the museum?s space. ?The office we are running at 1, Sudder Street was handed over to us in 1911 and a government notification was also made in the Bengal Gazette in this regard,? claimed its deputy director H.S. Debnath. ?So this is not museum space but space that belongs to us.? 

 An official of the Anthropological Survey of India said it would soon vacate the premises and shift to a building coming up at Salt Lake. 

 The director of the Zoological Survey of India, J.R.B. Alfred, refused to comment. However, an official said the space was given to them by the museum?s board of trustees and admitted that it would be difficult to maintain zoological galleries at the museum once they are asked to vacate the space. 

 A senior museum official said these central government offices have been running their units on the premises since 1912 and several attempts were made by previous directors of the museum to remove them.

 The museum?s present director, Shaktikali Basu, said they have plans to open a sales counter and a cafeteria in the complex. 

 ?We have plans to sell models of some of our famous collections after we manage to set up the sales counter. We will also relocate our restoration unit to a bigger place after we get some more space,? he added.

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 21: A division bench of Calcutta High Court today upheld the convictions of 16 CPM activists from Kharagpur, West Midnapore, for murdering a CPI worker. The bench also confirmed the 10-year rigorous imprisonment ordered by the trial court.

 The accused, who killed Subrata Ghosh on March 31 1986, were all granted bail after the trial court convicted them in 1989. Upholding the lower court?s sentence, the division bench today asked them to surrender within 15 days.

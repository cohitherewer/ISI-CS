 Early malaria attacks ring alarm

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, April 9: West Midnapore health authorities have decided to put all the 35,000 residents of Belpahari block on a dose of preventive anti-malaria drugs and examine their blood samples, in the wake of a spurt in the disease in Jhargram subdivision.

 Health officials said Belpahari, 50 km from Jhargram town and more than 200 km from Calcutta, is an endemic zone for malaria and there is reason to believe that the disease is spreading from the block. In March, 28 malaria deaths ? 12 of them in malignant cases ? have been reported from various hospitals in the subdivision.

 ?Between March 9 and 28, 12 deaths were reported in Jhargram subdivisional hospital alone,? said Sandip Sanyal, the superintendent of the hospital.

 ?Altogether 350 persons have been afflicted with malaria in the subdivision in March alone. Of this, 250 have been detected with malignant malaria,? said the district?s chief medical officer of health, Mangobinda Mondal.

 Malaria cases are also being reported from Jambonki and Gopiballavpur and Dalkati. The 10-bed Belpahari primary health centre is bursting at its seams and 139 patients, most of them suffering from malaria, are crammed on the floor and veranda.

 Mondal said the disease has struck early this year. ?We think the trend is alarming. So, we have decided to take blood samples of all 35,000 villagers in Belpahari and give them the preventive doses of anti-malarial drugs. After getting reports on the blood samples, we will revise our doses if needed,? he said.

 Ten medical teams left for the 10 gram-panchayat areas of Belpahari on Thursday.

 Officials said 98 per cent of malaria cases reported every year from Belpahari are malignant. ?We find that attacks of malaria in the forest areas of Belpahari is worst during the monsoon and declines when winter sets in. But, there are over two months to go before the monsoon and malaria has already assumed alarming proportions,? an official said.

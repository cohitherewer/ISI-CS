 Burdwan, Nov. 21: A woman who had fled her husbands torture with one of her two sons and a baby in the womb gave away her daughter, born a month-and-a-half ago, to a couple yesterday because she did not have the money to bring her up.

 Rasina Bibi, 32, handed over her daughter to Sarafat Mullick ? an optician at Katwa in Burdwan ? and his wife Samia, who are childless after 11 years of marriage, following an agreement signed on a non-judicial stamp paper. 

 The agreement says that henceforth it is the couples responsibility to bring up the child. 

 The Katwa subdivisional officer called the dealing illegal and asked police to inquire into it. A child cannot be given away on the basis of such an agreement. It has to be settled in court. Although I have not received any complaint against anyone, I have asked the police to investigate the matter and submit a report, said Amit Jyoti Sengupta.

 Rasina, whose parents were agricultural labourers, was married to a small farmer of Uttar Pradesh 15 years ago. 

 From the time my first son was born, my husband gradually lost interest in me and beat me up on the slightest pretext. After the second child, the torture increased. When I became pregnant a third time, I could not bear it any longer. I fled home with my youngest son, she said.

 On arriving at Katwa, about 200 km from Calcutta, she was greeted by an empty ramshackle hut that had been her home 15 years ago. Her parents had died about eight years ago. I cleaned up what was left of our house and started living there with seven-year-old Nazim. Neighbours like Mozammel Sheikh and Hasan Sheikh recognised me and their family members helped me during my pregnancy, Rasina said.

 After the girl was born, she began to beg on the streets of Katwa. 

 I have no income. How can I feed three mouths? I feel tired begging with a baby in my arms. The winter is coming and the child would have died. So, I was very happy when Sarafatbhai asked me for my daughter. At least in a good house, she will be properly looked after, said Rasina between sobs.

 Samia said she felt bad watching her beg with the baby. I heard from neigh-bours that she was finding it difficult raising her child.When we asked Rasina, she readily agreed to give us the baby.

 Additional district magistrate Ashish Chakraborty said such an incident was unheard of in the district ? where a mother gave her baby away because of poverty. He added that an agreement on a non-judicial stamp paper between two persons outside a court is invalid. 

 The childs mother is still the babys legal guardian. If Sarafat Mullick wants to adopt her, he will have to go to the social welfare directorate. The matter will have to be legalised, he added.

 Sarafat said he had no idea that his agreement had no legal validity. Now that I have come to know of it, I will seek legal advice, he added. The baby he will not let go of.

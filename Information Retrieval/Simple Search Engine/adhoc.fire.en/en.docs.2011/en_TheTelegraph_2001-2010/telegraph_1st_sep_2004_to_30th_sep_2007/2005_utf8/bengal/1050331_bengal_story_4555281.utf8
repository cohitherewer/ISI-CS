 Couple plots to butcher lover 

 - Ties 

 severed, blood flows 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, March 30: A 

 young housewife in Nadia nearly severed the genitals of 

 her former lover last night at the behest of her husband.

 Sania Bibi, 22, told police that Ombar Sheikh sneaked into her house at Battala village in Nakashipara, 130 km from Calcutta, when she was busy with domestic chores. Her two young children were asleep in a nearby room.

 ?Sania told us that Ombar wanted to get intimate with her but she refused. Then a verbal exchange led to an altercation,? a police officer said.

 Her husband Muslim Sheikh, a daily labourer, returned home around 9 pm and is said to have overheard Ombar, a farmer, passing lewd comments at Sania.

 ?Muslim became angry and started beating Ombar with an iron rod. A bleeding Ombar lost consciousness and fell to the ground,? said district superintendent of police Benoy Chakraborty.

 Sania told Muslim that Ombar had sneaked into the house and tried to rape her. ?Muslim became furious and asked Sania to cut off Ombar?s penis to teach him a lesson. She brought out a razor and set about cutting off his genitals,? the officer said.

 Ombar, whose cries of pain brought residents to his rescue, is fighting for life at Shaktinagar Hospital here, where he was shifted from the block hospital. Doctors have put a dozen stitches on him, including eight on his genitals.

 Sania and Muslim were arrested on a complaint by Ombar?s wife Arifan, Chakraborty said. 

 ?We questioned the residents and Sania, who revealed that she had an affair with Ombar earlier (before her marriage three years ago). We have to interrogate Ombar to ascertain whether he tried to rape Sania,? he added.

 Arifan said she knew her husband would visit Muslim?s house last night. ?My husband had loaned some money to Muslim several months ago. The loan was not repaid. My husband had gone to Muslim?s house to ask for the money.?

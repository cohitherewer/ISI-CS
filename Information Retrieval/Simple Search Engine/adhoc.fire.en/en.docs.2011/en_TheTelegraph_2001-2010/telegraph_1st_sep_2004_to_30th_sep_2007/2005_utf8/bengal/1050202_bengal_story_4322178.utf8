 Salary dock for 

defaulter teachers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Feb. 1: The district primary school council has asked school managing committees to deduct salaries of about 200 teachers who took bank loans and refused to repay.

 Council officials said the teachers had taken the money citing various needs ? house building and buying flats to cars and other requirements.

 All of them had been defaulting for the past three to four years. Shibaji Porel, the district inspector of schools, said: ?The banks had been writing to us repeatedly and so we instructed the managing committees of the schools concerned to deduct the instalments from their salary.? 

 An official said if the managing committees do not respond to the instruction, the council would step in. ?We came to know from the complaints lodged by the banks that the teachers took between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 3 lakh each. But they had not been repaying their loan for the past four years or so. The banks sent the teachers repeated reminders. When they fell on deaf ears, the banks lodged the complaints with us,? he added.

 In most cases, an official said, the teachers ?wanted the money to build a house or buy a flat?. Some wanted cars and others took personal loans, for which no reason needs to be cited.

 Council chairman Saidul Haque said: ?We have taken similar measures before.?

 About five years ago, the salaries of 100 schoolteachers trying to evade repayment of bank loans were blocked.

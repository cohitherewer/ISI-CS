 CPI leader held for mob fury

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Feb. 3: After yesterday?s clash over the recruitment of ?outsiders? as guards for an open-cast mine, Jambad today wore a deserted look with its men having fled fearing police action.

 Last night, the police raided Jambad and adjoining villages in Andal, about 250 km from Calcutta. Manju Bose, a CPI leader and member of the Burdwan zilla parishad, was among 43 people arrested. Another zilla parishad member, R.C. Singh ? also of the CPI ?is said to be absconding. 

 The leaders are accused of inciting a mob that attacked a team led by Debjyoti Saha, the officer-in-charge of Pandaveswar police station, who was rushed to Durgapur Steel Plant Hospital with serious injuries and has received 13 stitches. 

 The 500-strong mob, which opposed the recruitment of ex-army men as guards, also gheraoed mine officials at the project office for over two hours and later ransacked it.

Calcutta, April 4: After Sangeet, Surya and Sangram, Tollywood is calling Pratim Chatterjee again.

 Haranath Chakraborty, director of blockbusters like Gyanarakol, Sathee and Naater Guru, came to Writers? Buildings today to secure the fire services minister?s nod for Ekar Sansar. The filmmaker, who directed Chatterjee in his earlier films, has this time cast him with Prosenjit, the reigning Tolly king, and Jishu Sengupta, the heartthrob. 

 The fire minister will play the heroine?s father, who helps in grooming the hero, a budding cricketer. Like a true film star, Chatterjee said: ?All my three films have been hits,? and bragged about his offers. ?Recently, I was offered a film by Tarun Majumdar, a director I respect.?

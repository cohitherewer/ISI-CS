 Police rejig with eye on sleuth hub 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 29: Police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee has overhauled the detective department in a bid to revive its glory days. 

 In one of the biggest shuffles in recent times, senior officers ? some of them serving the city police for over two decades ? known for their efficiency have been brought back to the department Mukherjee headed as deputy commissioner.

 The seven police station officers-in-charge who have been picked to head various wings of the detective department are A.B. Majumdar (Taltala), Asish Sengupta (Maidan), Naseem Ali (Muchipara), D.P. Bhattacharya (Hare Street), Fayaz Khan (Park Street), Samir Gupta (Bowbazar) and Apurba Som Chowdhury (Burtolla). Some of these officers worked under Mukherjee earlier. 

 Two detective department officers in charge of the anti-robbery and anti-burglary sections have been sent to the traffic police and special branch.

 Altogether 86 officers were handed transfer orders last night. In the city, 42 police stations out of 48 will now have new officers-in-charge. An officer said some of the officers never worked in the detective department, ?but have a very good track record and network?.

 Culprit free, namesake in jail 

 RANJAN LAHIRY

 Burdwan, Aug. 1: Shantiranjan Das, a man in his 40s, had to spend three days behind bars and face social stigma for months on end. All because he was also called Dilip by friends and relatives.

 Burdwan police picked up Shantiranjan because his nickname matched with that of a youth who had allegedly molested a woman. He had repeatedly pleaded with the officers that he was not the one they were looking for, but to no avail. 

 After making Shantiranjan, a lottery ticket-seller, attend court for over a year and face a humiliating trial for molestation about which he was clueless, the police admitted last month that it was a case of mistaken identity.

 Radharani Das, a housewife at Baranilpur-Kumarpara, about 130 km from Calcutta, had lodged a complaint of molestation against Dilip Das, her neighbour, on July 13, 1995. 

 The same day, the son of the districts retired head police constable, Chittaranjan Das, was picked up. The police submitted a chargesheet in four days and the trial began. After a month in jail, Dilip Das obtained bail.

 But from 1995 to 2003, he never appeared in court for the trial, said an officer of Burdwan police station, adding: The court issued an arrest warrant against him on December 4, 2003.

 The police swung into action. However, looking for Dilip Das, a police team led by assistant sub-inspector Alimuddin Dafadar raided Shantiranjans house on May 30, 2004, at Natunpara, an adjoining neighbourhood. 

 After three days in a lock-up, he was granted bail but there was no respite from the court. I told them repeatedly that I was not the person they were looking for. But they did not listen?. recounted Shantiranjan. I wrote at least 10 letters to the then district superintendent of police, N. K. Singh, and Burdwan police station inspector-in-charge Tapas Ghosh?. But that did not help.

 Even after Radharani Das submitted a written statement to the police saying Shantiranjan was not the man who had outraged her modesty and that she knew the culprit by face, the police took a year to admit their fault. The court acquitted him on July 22. 

 Dilip Das, who virtually lives on his pensioner father, is still roaming free. When contacted, he made a lewd remark and said: I know how to manage the police. 

 Asked about the delay, no officer had a satisfactory answer. The police said they made the mistake because Shantiranjans and Dilip Dass fathers shared their names as well. Superintendent Peeyush Pandey said: I will look into why it took so long. An inquiry will be conducted against the policemen involved in the case. Stern action will be initiated against them if the delay was a result of their fault. The actual culprit will be arrested soon. 

 The lone bread-earner for his wife and daughter, Shantiranjan, is now fighting to relaunch his lottery business. The police arrested me to protect the real culprit?.

 Poisonous ojhas 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 17: A group of eight witchdoctors has been trying to breathe life into a six-year-old boy, who was declared dead by doctors on Tuesday after he was bitten by a cobra.

 The boys body lay on the ground in front of a Kali temple at Rudrapur in the Mandirbazar area of South-24-Parganas, 70 km from Calcutta, as the ojhas chanted mantras.

 A cobra had bitten Gopal, the eldest son of Kachari Haldar, on Tuesday morning while he was playing with a hen. An unconscious Gopal was taken to a health centre, 2 km away, where the doctors declared him dead. His parents brought the body home and were preparing for the last rites, when the witchdoctors arrived and told them that they could bring their son back to life by Sunday. The ojhas then took the boys body to the Kali temple, said Salil Das, a villager.

 When news reached the health centre today, its employees informed the district chief medical officer, who alerted police. An officer said the force would ensure cremation at the earliest. A rationalist body in Canning said the incident was part of a novel ploy devised by some people to make money.

 Taslima keeps hope alive

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 13: Taslima Nasreen has her bags packed, but she carries the hope of coming back soon.

 The Bangladeshi poet and novelist, however, has no clue about the fate of her plea to the Indian government for a residence permit, which means citizenship.

 ?I approached the home ministry for Indian citizenship last month, but I am not aware of the status of my application. I have learnt from the media that my visa has been extended for another six months,? she told The Telegraph after addressing members of the Ladies Business Forum, a city-based organisation.

 With the Indian authorities maintaining a mum, the writer ? in self-exile since 1994 after religious fundamentalists in Bangladesh charged her with blasphemy and issued death threats against her ? is heading west for the summer. 

 Next month, she will leave for Europe and spend three to four months in Sweden and France. But, she said, ?I want to come back here as I know that the writer in me will be dead outside this part of the globe?. The writer added that she is ?not sure? whether she will be granted a visa as ?at times immigration authorities even deny applications for tourist visa?. 

 From sharing her views on the plight of women to how she coped with death threats from fundamentalists, the writer discussed a host of issues during her hour-long interaction with the ladies today.

 ?The condition of women in India is not much different, but things are slightly better here,? she said, replying to a question.

 Taslima, keen to make Calcutta her second home, stressed that she wanted to live here because of the language and the culture of Bengal.

 According to her, countries like Sweden and France, which welcomed her with open arms after she ran into trouble with the Bangladeshi government, will make her inactive. ?Things are too proper there and I will not be able to write. I do not write for entertainment, I write for a cause,? she said to thunderous applause. 

 Taslima also read out some of her poems and shared personal trivia like her favourite food, clothes and writers.

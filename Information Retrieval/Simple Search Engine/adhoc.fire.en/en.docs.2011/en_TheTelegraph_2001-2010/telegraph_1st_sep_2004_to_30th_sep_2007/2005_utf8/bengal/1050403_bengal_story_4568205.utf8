 City bleeding from intestine, but unaware

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Calcutta, April 2: When 45-year-old Aranya Chatterjee began complaining about frequent palpitation and angina (pain in the chest), he thought it was a heart problem. 

 Scurrying from one cardiologist to the other, Chatterjee finally found out that there was something seriously wrong with, not his heart, but the gastro-intestinal system.

 With one new patient being admitted everyday with gastro-intestinal (GI) bleeding and some even dying, city-based doctors have pressed the alarm bells. ?In three to four years, cases of GI bleeding from the mouth and the rectum has risen significantly in the city. In some cases, GI bleeding has been detected in anaemia patients during blood tests. The worrying part is the lack of awareness about this dangerous condition,? said Mahesh Goenka, head of the gastroenterology department at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital, Calcutta. 

 Doctors say excessive use of painkillers and irregular diet are the main reasons behind the condition. ?Indiscriminate use of painkillers, for instance, ruptures the mucosa (stomach lining) and results in GI bleeding in all forms,? said surgical gastroenterologist Sanjay De Bakshi.

 Other reasons like sclerosis of liver, ulcers in duodenum, acute stress, conjugal malformation and tuberculosis, too, have been contributing to the steep rise in GI bleeding 

 Not just GI bleeding, the city is also apparently suffering from a high incidence of rectal ulcers. The figure is much higher than, say, Chennai, Mumbai and Chandigarh. 

 ?In hospitals here, about a couple of cases are reported every week, which is quite high,? Goenka said.

 The issues were recently discussed at Endocon 2005, organised in the city by the Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy of India. Experts from across the world brainstormed over several sessions to find ways to curb the incidence of GI bleeding cases.

 What has left doctors in Calcutta most worried is that anaemia and blood vomiting are often mistaken as tuberculosis. ?An astounding 80 per cent of the patients feel that either they are suffering from cancer or TB, which later turns out to be GI bleeding, which has a 10 per cent mortality rate in the city,? said Goenka. GI bleeding can lead to acute anaemia. Blood can go into the lungs and cause pneumonia and it can even affect the heart.

 A doctor said most patients believe that bleeding from rectum means piles or get panicky and run to a cancer specialist, only to learn later that it is GI bleeding. The remedy lies in early detection, long-term medication or surgery.

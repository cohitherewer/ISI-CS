 Highrise killing 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 13: A domestic help was murdered allegedly by a security guard in a multi-storeyed building in Dum Dum this morning.

 Her throat slit, 40-year-old Meena Sau was found lying in a pool of blood next to the lift on the ground floor of the five-storeyed apartment building on Nagendranath Road at Sathgachi, police said. The guards room is next to the lift.

 Preliminary investigations suggest the security guard of the building has committed the murder, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas. 

 The guard, 50-year-old Kailash Ray, whose blood-soaked lungi was hanging from a rain pipe next to the terrace, is absconding and a team of policemen will head to his home state Bihar to track him down. A search warrant has been issued.

 Meena, a resident of Gora Bazar in Dum Dum, used to work in several houses in the neighbourhood, including that of a senior engineer in a public sector company who is a resident of the building. Her husband Jagannath works at a sweet shop and the couple has three daughters.

 She had come for work as usual at 9 this morning and left an hour later. There was nothing unusual in her behaviour when she left the engineers flat, said a police officer. 

 Around 10.30 am, residents of an adjacent building saw Ray climbing down the pipe of the building. Their suspicions arisen, they rushed to alert their neighbours. When they stepped into the building, they found Meenas body. It seems the throat was slit with a sharp knife, the officer said, adding that the motive behind the murder is not known.

 No to officer Ghisingh 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 28: The government today made it clear that Subash Ghisingh would neither be appointed administrator nor adviser to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC).

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said: ?The government is yet to decide on an administrator or adviser to the administrator for the council. In fact, I don?t know whether there will be such a post at all.? 

 He added: ?Moreover, the political parties in the hills don?t want Ghisingh as an administrator or adviser. As far as we are concerned, his term in the council is almost over.? 

 Pushed against a wall on the issue of holding elections to the DGHC by March 25 ? when its term ends ? with Ghisingh refusing to participate, the government had decided to appoint a caretaker to the council after its present term ends. But the GNLF, which now runs the body, rejected the plan amid reports that it might budge from its hard stand if Ghisingh is made the caretaker till the elections.

 ?No political leader can be appointed the administrator,? Bhattacharya said, adding that he met home secretary A.K. Deb today to discuss the issue.

 Officials said a bill for an amendment to the DGHC act is being drafted as the council does not have the provision for an administrator. The bill will be placed in the Assembly when it opens for the budget session on March 10.

 Bhattacharya, also a secretariat member of the CPM?s Darjeeling district committee, said the amendment would be on the lines of the law governing municipal bodies. ?The municipalities have the provision of being governed by an administrator or a board of administrators.?

 After talks with Ghisingh ? the DGHC chairman ? in Delhi and Calcutta failed to end the impasse, the chief minister sought the Prime Minister?s intervention last week.

 Notice to Great Eastern employees

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 25: The clock began ticking on the employees of Great Eastern Hotel with the government today issuing a notice asking them to opt for early retirement in a month.

 Amid shows of protest by the 400-odd employees, the authorities pasted the four-page notice telling them to apply for an early retirement scheme (ERS). It says the applications must reach by March 26. 

 Last week, the government finally decided to close shop as part of a move to privatise the ailing establishment. Unable to run the over-a-century-old hotel profitably, it had advertised in dailies a few months ago inviting expressions of interest from private firms. 

 Jagannath Bag, the member secretary of the hotel, said: ?As the chief executive, I issued the notice this afternoon?? 

 All 378 regular and 60 contractual employees are entitled to apply for the scheme, but Bag said they will not be eligible for re-employment in any state government enterprise. 

 The CPM?s labour arm, Citu, made it clear that no worker can go against the government?s decision, but its leaders at the hotel lined up a string of protests from Monday saying none of its members would opt for the scheme.

 State Citu chief Shyamal Chakraborty said: ?Those who defy (the government) will risk disciplinary action.?

 But Pravas Samir Roy, general secretary of the Citu-affiliated Great Eastern Hotel Employees? and Workers? Union, dared the leadership to act against the employees. ?Let?s see what they can do,? he said.

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee, president of the Intuc-affiliated hotel union, said its members, too, will reject the offer, but ruled out a ?vigorous? movement against it.

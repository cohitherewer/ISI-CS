 Students take JU row to Raj Bhavan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 18: Representatives from the Jadavpur University Faculty of Engineering amp; Technology Students Union (Fetsu) today called on governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, who was among the first to criticise the police crackdown on fasting students on June 10. 

 This is the first time since the incident that the students have met the governor ? also chancellor of the varsity.

 An official at Raj Bhavan described the meeting as fruitful. The governor has heard out their entire story and said that he will do the needful, he added. 

 Sources said Gandhi will soon meet the vice-chancellor for the second time to assess the situation. 

 During the three-hour meeting today ? it went on till late evening ? the governor was apprised of the crisis, which started with students going on a fast-unto-death to protest against the suspension of five seniors for allegedly assaulting some senior officials in 2003.

 Fetsu general secretary Amit Chakraborty said: The governor was not aware of the whole picture. We told him everything in detail.... He listened to us with complete seriousness and has said that he will think over the matter and then discuss it further.

 The second round of meetings between Fetsu and the five-member inquiry committee is due on Monday. 

 The committee, headed by Manoj Mitra, dean of the faculty of engineering and technology, had been set up, on the advice of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, to find out measures to restore normality on the campus.

 After the first round of meetings on Friday, both Fetsu and members of the panel had expressed satisfaction, although they failed to come to an agreement. They said several differences had been resolved and a fine solution is expected soon.

 At a convention of Jadavpur Universitys former students held on the campus this afternoon, it was unanimously agreed that the suspension order on the five should be withdrawn unconditionally and normal campus life restored immediately. 

 The meeting also condemned the police action against the fasting students and held the university authorities responsible and demanded an apology from them. 

 Besides, the former students sought punishment for the police officers responsible for alleged atrocities on a woman and assault on injured students in Bangur hospital. They asked the university authorities to ensure that such incidents are not repeated.

 The convention demanded the scrapping of the report given by the Amit Sen committee. Besides falsely implicating innocent students, it is a mockery of natural justice, it said.

 Loot at shoot for film team

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, May 20: A telefilm crew from Bengal was robbed and assaulted last night at McLuskieganj, 65 km from here.

 Around 40 armed and masked youths, aged between 14 and 18, barged into the guesthouse where the technicians were staying and made off with cash and valuables worth Rs 3 lakh after a two-hour raid. 

 Some of the technicians were thrashed when they refused to disclose the whereabouts of the women cast. 

 The team, which was to have stayed in McLuskieganj till May 26, will return tomorrow.

 Rupa Ganguly was part of the crew but, at the time of the attack, she was in another guesthouse, 2 km away, with the rest of the cast. 

 The team came to McLuskieganj on May 17 to shoot for Obela, a film based on a story by Buddhadeb Guha, many of whose works are set in the forests of Palamau.

 Police said Naxalites were behind the attack and pinned the blame on the film team for not informing them in advance about their arrival. 

 Santosh Sinha, the officer-in-charge of the Khelari police station, said: Such incidents are common in the area. If the crew had informed us about the shoot, we would have provided them security.

 An FIR has been lodged. There have been no arrests, though the police claimed to have identified the gang. 

 Ganguly said they had not informed the police because they were told by residents not to do so. Our team has around 45 people. The local people misguided us by saying the area was calm and had no criminal activities.

 The crew, she said, had booked three guesthouses. There were 10 to 15 members in each of them. The robbers broke into one of the guesthouses. First they asked everyone to assemble at one place. Then they wanted to know where the women were. When the technicians refused to give any information, the boys assaulted them with butts of revolvers and knives, Ganguly said. 

 The men are too traumatised to continue shooting. The police said two or three boys have been detained.

 Sweetener for bitter brew

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Sept. 11: Finance minister Asim Dasgupta today announced a slew of schemes that would enable unemployed youths in the ailing tea gardens to earn a living.

 The schemes for the dependants of garden workers encourage them to take up a trade of their choice with bank loans. A committee will be formed to see that the schemes are implemented through a time-bound programme, Dasgupta said, speaking at a workshop organised by the north Bengal zone of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Siliguri mahkuma parishad.

 Bank executives, govern-ment officials and representatives of 47 tea gardens and panchayats in the parishad area were present on the occasion.

 CIIs north Bengal chairman Kamal K. Mittal said the tea industry has suffered setbacks with competition going up and profits falling. The situation requires a new generation of professionals in the garden workers families who can become self-employed. The CII would show them the avenues available and facilitate their training, Mittal said.

 Dasgupta said: Before Puja, the committee would have to identify viable schemes and their beneficiaries. The loan disbursal can start after the festival. In the first year, the target for all stakeholders is 4,000 cases loans (see chart).

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya admitted that the earlier self-help schemes have sadly not reached the tea gardens.

 Doctor faces neglect axe 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, March 3: A year-and-a-half after the death of a mother and her newborn at the district hospital here, a doctor and two nurses have been charged with negligence.

 A chargesheet, signed by the health secretary, has been served to Dr Rudrendu Chattopadhyay and nurses Tulsi Das and Renuka Sarbadhikary by district chief medical officer of health Gopal Sarkar. The trio, under suspension since last May, has been asked to respond to the charges in 10 days. 

 Chattopadhyay, the district secretary of the Association of Health Service Doctors, said: ?I will proceed according to norms. Being the secretary of our association here, I do not want to comment.?

 The trio has been accused of not attending to Bharati Haldar and her daughter, both of who died on August 5, 2003. The next day, her relatives alleged that there was none to attend to her because they could not pay Rs 300, which some Group-D staff had demanded. ?They (the nurses) disappeared after that,? her mother said.

 Doctors and nurses today began an agitation at the hospital to protest against the suspension order. 

 A district official said: ?The health department had ordered an inquiry into the deaths. The charges were framed on the basis of the report.? 

 District magistrate Ashok Bala, too, had ordered a probe. Subdivisional officer Subrata Sarkar?s report was also sent to the health secretary.

 However, former chief medical officer Ashok Banerjee had absolved the trio of any responsibility. Bharati, he had said, had been suffering from high blood pressure, swollen limbs and cramps.

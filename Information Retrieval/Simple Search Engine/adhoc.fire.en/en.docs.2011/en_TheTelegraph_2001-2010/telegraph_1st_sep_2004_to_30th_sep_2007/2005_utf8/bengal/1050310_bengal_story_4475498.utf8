 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, March 9: Kamaluddin Ansari alias Munna, who went missing a few days before his wedding, has come back with a wound in his right leg.

 The resident of Metiabruz was brought back from Nagpur by his elder brother Qiamuddin and another family member.

 Both Kamaluddin and his brother Salauddin were set to wed on February 9. But Kamaluddin went missing while shopping in Fancy Market in Kidderpore. 

 Qiamuddin said Kamaluddin, who was missing for a month, is in serious condition and cannot remember how he landed up in Nagpur. However, he recalled taking up a job in a coal washery there. When a big piece of coal fell on his right leg a few days ago, the washery owner did not bother to arrange for his treatment. 

 Kamaluddin then contacted one of his friends in Calcutta who informed his family. 

 Krishnagar: A retired headmistress and a former secretary of the managing committee of a higher secondary school have been accused of misappropriating funds. Swati Sarma, who holds both the posts now at the Rajlaksmi Kanya Vidyapith in Borojagulia in Haringhata, about 55 km from Calcutta, lodged an FIR against the duo. She also charged them with fudging school accounts.

 Burdwan: Three persons have been arrested on charges of running an inter-state car smuggling racket at Ichhlabad under Burdwan police station, about 100 km from Calcutta. Three stolen cars ? all registered outside Bengal ? were recovered, police said. 

 Barasat: A bomb hoax stalled proceedings in the chief judicial magistrate?s court in Barasat in North 24-Parganas district on Wednesday. Superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said a bomb squad combed the courtroom but did not find anything.

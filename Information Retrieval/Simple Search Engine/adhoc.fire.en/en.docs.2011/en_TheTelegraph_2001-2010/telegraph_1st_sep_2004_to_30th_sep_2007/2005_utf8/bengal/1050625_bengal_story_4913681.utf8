 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, June 24: A police vehicle tonight crushed under its wheels a man in his early 30s and fled the spot.

 The man was crossing BT Road near Chiria More in north Calcutta around 9.30 when knocked down. Residents of the area, some 100 feet from Cossipore police station, took him to RG Kar Hospital, where he was declared dead.

 Around 8.30 pm, P.R. Das, a sergeant of the south traffic guard, was dragged about 500 m by a private bus near Rabindra Sadan. Das, who had just stepped out of office when hit, was taken to SSKM with serious injuries to his right arm. 

 Calcutta: With the third deadline for submitting ERS applications set to expire on June 30, the Great Eastern Hotel employees unions renewed bargaining with the government on Friday. The Citu-backed union demanded that services of the contractual staff be regularised. Its representatives met tourism secretary Tapan Barman, who rejected the demand. Such a step would have serious rep-ercussions on employees of other sick units facing closure, he said. Intuc leaders will meet public enterprises minister Nirupam Sen on Saturday.

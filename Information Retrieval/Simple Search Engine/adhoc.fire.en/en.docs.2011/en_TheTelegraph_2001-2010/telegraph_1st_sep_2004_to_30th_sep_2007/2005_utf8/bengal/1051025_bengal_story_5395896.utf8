 MLA gets the boot

 OUR BUREAU

 Krishnagar/Calcutta, Oct. 24: The CPM today expelled its MLA from Krishnagunj in Nadia, Sushil Biswas, for his alleged criminal connections and possessing unaccounted for wealth. 

 He was also found guilty of working against party MP from Krishnagar Jyotirmoyee Sikdar during last years Lok Sabha elections. 

 Biswas said he was being victimised for not toeing the party line. Let the leadership come out with a document elaborating my criminal activities and wealth. It will not be able to prove any of the allegations, he said. 

 CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said in Calcutta this afternoon Biswas was expelled for anti-party activities. 

 Earlier, Ashu Ghosh, the partys Nadia secretary told a news conference here Sushil Biswas was thrown out of the CPM on the basis of the findings of an inquiry committee. It found Biswas guilty of having a nexus with anti-socials, amassing wealth disproportionate to his income and working against Sikdar before the general elections.

 Ghosh, however, refused to elaborate on Sushil Biswass criminal connections. We have indicted Biswas on specific charges and it is your duty to find out whether they are true, he said. 

 A three-time CPM legislator from Krishnagunj, Sushil Biswas was suspended in July last year. Today he said he could not be expelled as he had not renewed the party membership. 

 The owner of 5 bighas ? which he has inherited ? a tractor and a two-storey house said he could show documents concerning a Rs 2-lakh bank loan. I had to sell off six cottahs for my daughters wedding last year, he added. 

 Biswas admitted that he had 13 cases pending against him, but insisted that he had no nexus with criminals. Its true that there are 13 cases, including rioting and arson, against me. But these are old cases. I want to ask the leaders why they nominated me thrice since 1991? 

 He admitted to having his reservations about Sikdars nomination for Krishnagar. I had resisted Sikdars candidature because she was an outsider. 

 Biswas also said that he would soon join Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress to ensure the CPMs defeat in Nadia.

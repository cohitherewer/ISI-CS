 Faiz mission called off

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, June 7: The Coast Guard today abandoned its week-long search for Rajiv Lahiri, the missing chief officer of MV Faiz, which got reduced to a shell in a mystery fire last week and is believed to have sunk yesterday. 

 ?We have suspended the search operation completely, said G. Singh, the Coast Guard commanding officer at Haldia.

 The vessel might have sunk, but we have no confirmation of that. The last location of the vessel was around 29 nautical miles from the point where we had initially located it, (about 150 nautical miles from Haldia) but the ship is now missing, Singh said.

 Late in the evening, the Dornier aircraft pressed into rescue mission was called back to Haldia, marking the end of the operation in which hundreds of miles were scanned both on land and water. 

 There is a possibility that someone might have rescued him and he is still in a state of shock, Singh said.

 Officials said the line used to tow the ship had snapped in rough weather and the rescue vessel lost MV Faiz in a storm. 

 No authority will state that the ship has sunk and we wont get the insurers clearance, said Pervez Rehman, the owner of the ship and chief of ITP Shipping Company. 

 A probe into the entire episode has begun.

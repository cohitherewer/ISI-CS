 Camac St murder suspect caught

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 14: About 

 a month after the gruesome murder of Tara Chand Banka and 

 his wife Sarda in their Camac Street apartment, a detective 

 department team has arrested the prime accused, Kebol Roy, 

 from Bihar. 

 Kebol, the couples domestic help, had introduced himself as Pancham to the Bankas and only after the double murders did the police find out his real identity.

 In his mid twenties, Kebol was last seen walking out of the Mansoravar Apartments with a bag about an-hour-and-a-half before the murders came to light. 

 He has been arrested by our team of officers from Banka district of Bihar and they are on their way back by road, said city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee. 

 Tara Chand Banka, 68, and his wife were found murdered in the morning of April 18 when their son broke into the flat. While Tara Chand lay on his drawing room divan with his face down, Sarda lay on her bed with her head smashed. The jewellery and cash were gone, but the rings on Tara Chands fingers and those worn by his wife were untouched. 

 The arrest, officers on the case said, was a major breakthrough as investigations had revealed that it was he who bludgeoned the couple to death in the early hours of April 18. 

 Soon afterwards, he left the flat with ornaments and cash worth over Rs 4 lakh. Among other things that the youth took away were two mobile phones that helped the police track him first in Asansol and then at Deogarh in Jharkhand. Two days later, when he switched off the mobile phones, two separate teams from the Shakespeare Sarani police station and the detective department took off on his trail.

 After combing at least eight villages under the Katoria police station in Banka district for days, we learnt that the domestic help was neither Pancham nor Mahesh but Kebol Roy, an officer said. In the course of the raids, the police learnt that Kebol hailed from Khejuria village and that he returned there a day after the murders.

 A day before the murder, the police said, Kebol learnt that the Bankas had withdrawn a large amount from the bank to attend a wedding. He first killed Tara Chand and then his wife before opening the almirah to take the money. Kebol also took away two bracelets of Sarda, each worth around Rs 25 lakh, said an officer.

 Pensionless disabled dead

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Feb. 5: The disabled son of a former railway employee died this morning after years of running from pillar to post to collect his father?s pension.

 Dilip Chatterjee (52) was declared 95 per cent handicapped by the social welfare department and was to receive pension from Eastern Railway under the pension rules after his mother?s death on November 11, 2001.

 Railway authorities had provided family pension to the widow of Jyotirmoy Chatterjee ? a former head clerk of the electrical department of the Kanchrapara workshop ? but failed to give the son his due.

 Orphaned, Dilip stayed at a relative?s residence, but could not bear the neglect. He was then helped by a family friend and former professor of Katwa College, Someswar Chatterjee.

 The professor had said a week ago that all papers regarding Dilip?s claim for pension had been sent to the railways three years ago. ?Whenever we contacted the railways, we were assured that something would be done very soon. But Dilip died without getting the pension.?

 Kanchrapara workshop personnel officer Prabir Kumar De refused to comment.

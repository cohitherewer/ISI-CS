 Tutor held for theft

 Chinsurah, Feb. 8: A private tutor was today arrested for an alleged crime that used to be associated with domestic helps ? cleaning up a chest. 

 Somnath Nandy was arrested this morning from his house in Chandernagore, 50 km from Calcutta, on the charge of stealing Rs 1.35 lakh from his student?s house. 

 Police said Nandy stole the money from the house of Kajal Pal, a grocer, who appointed him two months ago to tutor his son Aritra, a Class I student of Hooghly Collegiate School. He apparently asked Aritra to go out of the room and play. ?When the child went out, he rummaged several drawers and found a bunch of keys. He came across the money in an almirah and wrapped it in a pair of trousers,? said an officer. The money and the make-do bag were recovered from Nandy?s house today.

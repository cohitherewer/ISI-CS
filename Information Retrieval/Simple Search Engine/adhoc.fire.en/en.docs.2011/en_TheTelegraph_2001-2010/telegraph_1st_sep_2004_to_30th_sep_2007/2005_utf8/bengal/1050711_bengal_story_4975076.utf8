 Ad hoc heads saddle varsity

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 10: The fate of the West Bengal University of Animal and Fishery Sciences, the only one of its kind, has been shrouded in uncertainty for over a year with all its top administrative posts occupied by acting heads.

 The posts of vice-chancellor, registrar, controller of examination and deans of the three faculties ? dairy, fishery and veterinary ? are occupied by acting heads, and this, a section of teachers allege, has rendered the institution inactive. 

 The university is also facing an acute shortage of teaching and non-teaching staff.

 The Adhyapak Sanstha recently made a deputation to governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi, also chancellor of the university.

 N.R. Pradhan, secretary of the Sanstha, said: We have demanded that all acting posts be made regular as this is taking a toll on the functioning of the university. The government was supposed to form a panel to select a regular vice-chancellor, which has not happened. The vice-chancellor has not made the acting heads regular in more than a year. Moreover, most of the acting heads lack requisite qualification as per the statute.

 The university is recruiting new teachers from August 12 and the Sanstha has alleged that there are anomalies in the appointments. There are a number of irregularities in the selection procedure. We have brought these to the chancellors notice, Pradhan said.

 Acting vice-chancellor Amal Krishna Bandopadhyay, however, insisted that he is following the rules and that the delay has been because of the time taken in acquiring governmental clearances.

 Anisur Rahaman, minister in charge of animal resources development, clarified his departments position. We have no problem in giving permission. The university never approached us for selecting permanent heads. When they did approach us for the teachers, we gave them permission.

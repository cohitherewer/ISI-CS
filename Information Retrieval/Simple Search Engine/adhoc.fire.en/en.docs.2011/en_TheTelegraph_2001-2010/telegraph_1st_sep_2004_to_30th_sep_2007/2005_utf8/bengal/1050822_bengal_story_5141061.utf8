 Rein on rebels

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Aug. 21: Alarmed at the increasing Maoist intrusions in the forest areas of Burdwan, the authorities have begun taking steps for the uplift of tribals so that rebels are not able to take advantage of their poverty.

 The district administration, police officials and some non-government organisations held a free medical check-up camp in the Kanksa forest belt ? a tribal area 180 km from Calcutta.

 Bikalpya, an NGO that runs a residential school there, promised financial support to 100 meritorious tribal students. Durgapur MP Sunil Khan, the Burdwan district CPM leadership and police superintendent Pijush Pandey were also present.

 Pandey urged the force to be more gentle towards the villagers. Only strict policing cannot stop terrorism and anti-police activities anywhere. We have to become friendlier to the people. The Burdwan police will provide help to meritorious poor students of the district and join hands with the NGOs, he said.

 The Kanksa CPM zonal secretary, Bireswar Mondal, and former zilla parishad sahasabhapati, Kabilal Maddi ? both of whom are on the hit list of the Maoists ? warned the villagers about the motive of the militants.

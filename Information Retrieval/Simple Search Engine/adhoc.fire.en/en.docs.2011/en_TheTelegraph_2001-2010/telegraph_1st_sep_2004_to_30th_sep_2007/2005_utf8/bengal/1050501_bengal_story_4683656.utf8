 Judge house

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 30: The state government has asked the Supreme Court for three months? extension of its May 19 deadline to auction former high court judge Bhagabati Prasad Banerjee?s Salt Lake residence.

 Officials said it was not possible to meet the deadline as a lot of time had been spent in selecting a valuer to assess the cost of Banerjee?s two-storeyed building. The former judge refused to accept the person picked by the government and has been insisting on appointing a high court-panelled valuer.

 The apex court, in its judgment on November 19, 2004, had directed the government to take over Banerjee?s FD 429 plot by putting the building on auction and paying him the money. If he refused to accept the price, a valuer would be appointed and he would decide the present market price of the building, which would be treated as reserve price. The apex court had said the entire process would have to be completed in six months and Banerjee would have to vacate the building within a year.

 When Banerjee refused to accept Rs 8.19 lakh offered by the government ? this was assessed as the price of the building as on the date of its construction ? the hunt for a valuer began. 

 ?We have made all efforts to complete the formalities so that the apex court order can be carried out within the deadline but we have even failed to get the building evaluated. We have informed the apex court and sought three months? time to execute the order,?? said urban development secretary K.S. Rajendrakumar.

 The case is likely to be taken up by the Supreme Court on May 6, when a petition filed by Tarak Singh seeking a clarification of the judgment will be heard. Singh was earlier a party to the case.

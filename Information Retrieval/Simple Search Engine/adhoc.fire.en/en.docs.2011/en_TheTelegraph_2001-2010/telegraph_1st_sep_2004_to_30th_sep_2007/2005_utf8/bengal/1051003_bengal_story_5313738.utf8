 Highway robbery with spikes

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Oct. 2: A gang of dacoits sprinkled iron spikes on a highway in West Midnapore and laid trees across it to loot eight trucks and passengers of a bus this morning.

 Police said the dacoits set their trap at two points on National Highway 6 ? in Mohanpur forest near Jhargram, 160 km from Calcutta.

 The dacoits, armed with revolvers and daggers, beat up the bus passengers and the truck drivers.

 Jhargram subdivisional police officer Ajay Thakur said three trucks were forced to a stop as the spikes punctured their tyres. Five empty LPG tankers were stopped by placing trees on the road. The bus, running behind, was also forced to a halt.

 The officer said five dacoits, with their faces covered, got into the bus heading to Haldia around 4 am.

 Md. Selim, who was driving a truck from Jamshedpur to Mecheda in East Midnapore, said he did not have the money to mend his front tyre. Truck drivers and residents blocked the highway demanding night-long police patrol.

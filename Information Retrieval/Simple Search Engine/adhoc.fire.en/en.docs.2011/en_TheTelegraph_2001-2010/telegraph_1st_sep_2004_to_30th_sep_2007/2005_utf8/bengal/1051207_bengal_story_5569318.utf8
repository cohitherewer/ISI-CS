 Witch widow punished

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Dec. 6: Lakshmi Murmu, a 22-year-old widow, was locked up in a room by fellow villagers who also tried to set it ablaze because they believed that she was a witch.

 Police said she had been staying with her parents at Bohar Mandirtala village near Memari, about 90 km from Calcutta, since her husband died four years ago. 

 On Thursday, an ojha (witchdoctor) told Lakshmis uncle Lippo that his daughter Pu-shpa, 17, was suffering from mental derangement because of her cousins influence. She is a witch, she should be driven out, the quack pronounced.

 The day after, Lippo, accompanied by seven-eight others locked her up, beat her and tried to set the room afire. 

 Lakshmi, however, managed to flee the room and finally reach her sister Sefalis house in Bhatar, 50 km away.

 Yesterday, Lakshmi went to the Burdwan court and pleaded with lawyers there to take up her case. One of them, Soma Mukherjee, took her to district superintendent of police Peeyush Pande. 

 I was stunned to hear her predicament. Its a shame, Pande said. The Memari police have been asked to provide protection to Lakshmi and pick up those who attacked her, including the ojha.

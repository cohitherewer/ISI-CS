 Dowry cloud

 Beldanga, March 29: Hosenara Khatun, 19, was found dead in a village in Beldanga, 180 km from Calcutta, yesterday. 

 The officer-in-charge of the local police station said she committed suicide but Hosenara?s father suggested that her mother and brother could have had a hand in it. Having failed to arrange her dowry, they had been beating her, he said.

 The fourth daughter of Jagat Sheikh was supposed to get married to a local youth, whose family demanded Rs 30,000. ?We couldn?t arrange the money,? said Jagat, crippled in an accident over a year ago.

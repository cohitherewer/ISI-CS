 Men of burden

 Behrampore, Feb. 18: Men have replaced cattle to till a sand bed of the Padma along the Bangladesh border.

 The residents of several villages ? Dayarampur, Galaderia, Taltali, Parashpur, Godagari, Bedepara and Udaynagar ? in Jalangi, about 250 km from Calcutta, had little else to do after the Border Security Force (BSF) banished cattle from the river to prevent their smuggling.

 The erosion of the Padma, sources said, has shifted the villages 7-8 km from their original location. As a result, an 8-km-wide char (sand bed) has emerged on the east bank ? only a few kilometres from the international border demarcated by concrete pillars. Eager to till the tract before it again goes under water around June, the villagers moved in, but their invasion suffered a major setback with the BSF jawans refusing to allow transportation of cattle. 

 Faijuddin Biswas and Gurupada Mondal were among many who pleaded with the Murshidabad district magistrate and the BSF officers in the area. A missive has also been sent to Union home minister Shivraj Patil. But nothing has come of all that as yet. The peasants have to sow by February if they are to fully reap the harvest.

 The residents of Dayarampur have already completed tilling 7 bighas. ?We repeatedly requested the jawans to allow each of us to take a pair of bullocks, but they said ?no?. We also met the commandant of the BSF?s 51 Battalion at Roshanbag? he refused to intervene. On January 22, we sent a mass petition to the Union home minister, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and the BSF director-general. Our efforts have been in vain,? Biswas said.

 The pradhan of the local Ghoshpara gram panchayat, CPM?s Santosh Roy, called the BSF denial an ?inhuman act?.

 M.A. Salek, a BSF sector commander, said: ?We became aware of the problem after the villagers lodged complaints. G.K. Sharma, DIG, Behrampore sector, had allowed them to take a pair of bullocks each for tilling the land. We do not know why the problem is persisting. The DIG, who is out of station, will take necessary steps on his return.?

 Additional district magistrate Nisith Kumar, who is in charge of the administration as the district magistrate is on leave, said the DM has met the BSF brass. ?I don?t know what transpired at the meeting.?

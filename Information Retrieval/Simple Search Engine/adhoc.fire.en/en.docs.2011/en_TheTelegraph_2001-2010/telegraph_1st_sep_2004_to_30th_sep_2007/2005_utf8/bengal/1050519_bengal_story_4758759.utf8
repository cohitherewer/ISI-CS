 Buddha drives PSU recast

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 18: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said no government ? right, left or centre ? can afford the huge cost of running loss-making units as he flagged off the second phase of restructuring 29 state public sector undertakings.

 The exercise will decide the fate of 80,000 employees of these companies, whose combined yearly losses amount to Rs 665 crore.

 The plan envisages classification of the units into three categories ? unviable units, which will be closed down; those that have potential for viability with limited requirement for investment; and companies for which the government will invite private partners and transfer 74 per cent equity stake.

 The restructuring will be spread over a period of two years till 2007 and require Rs 1,700 crore which is expected to come from multilateral funding agencies like the Department for International Development (DFID), UK, World Bank, Asian Development Bank and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation.

 A concept note was submitted to the Union finance ministry on March 31 seeking external financial assistance.

 With Assembly elections around the corner, the second phase of the exercise, which includes restructuring the West Bengal State Electricity Board and the state transport corporations, has become a challenge for the worker-friendly Left Front government.

 Although the government is aware of the political ramifications, Bhattacharjee underlined the need for going ahead with the plan. 

 Right, left or centre, no government can afford to bear a huge expenditure of Rs 1,500 crore every year to run these units. We have to get rid of them, he said at a national workshop on restructuring public sector enterprises: best practices, organised by the governments public enterprises department and the DFID.

 We represent working classes and so our responsibility is to protect the interest of the working class. We are providing a social safety network for the workers who will be separated during the second phase of restructuring. It is a much bigger project than the first phase, the chief minister added.

 In the first phase, which the government is about to complete, 26 loss-making units were identified. The DFID has given a grant of Rs 200 crore for the exercise involving 9,944 workers. The government, which is in dire need of funds, saved Rs 40 crore in 2004-05 by restructuring these PSUs.

 The government has engaged a spin doctor ? communications specialist Grey World-wide ? to devise a strategy, both external and internal, for smooth sailing of the second phase.

 A new slogan coined for the government says: Ami notun Banga, samriddhi amar sathey (I am the new Bengal, prosperity is with me).

 Howard Taylor, deputy country head, DFID India, said the departments main goals were improving health, education and urban infrastructure. But we funded Bengals restructuring move as it is aimed at reducing expenditure and unlock resources for meeting social obligations.

 The DFID feels the first phase of the restructuring exercise was successful and implemented professionally by taking all stakeholders into confidence.

 The state government is also taking the advice of CB Richard Ellis, the worlds premier real estate services company, on how to use the land being unlocked following the closure of some of the sick public sector units.

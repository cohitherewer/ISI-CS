 Siliguri, Feb. 19: The loudest cheers were for Sania Mirza, but when it came to putting the money where the memorabilia was, the auction army helped Sourav Ganguly ace the tennis star.

 The people?s princess had to take a bow to the prince of purchase power with a Sourav cap that the Team India captain wore during the match in Melbourne recently and a Sourav hat fetching Rs 2 lakh each. Also going for Rs 2 lakh was a miniature bat signed by Sourav, Sania and Bhaichung Bhutia. Sania?s racquet and outfit from the Australian Open fetched only Rs 1 lakh.

 By the time Bhaichung Bhutia, Sania and Sourav left the Kanchenjunga stadium, the auction of sports gear in aid of tsunami survivors, which had begun with a target of Rs 30 lakh, had crossed Rs 55 lakh and counting. All thanks to the star trio and the Calcutta moneybags.

 A Rahul Dravid bat for Rs 50,000, a Bhaichung jersey, a pair of gloves from Sourav, an outfit from Sania?. The items went for handsome amounts, often with a nudge from urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya.

 Bengal Ambuja chief Harsh Neotia?s name cropped up a few times, as did that of Forum boss Rahul Saraf. Neotia even picked up a gold chain of Bappi Lahiri, who had kicked off proceedings at the stadium with a medley before the sports stars arrived.

 It was Sania?s first public appearance outside Hyderabad after winning the WTA title and the Sania mania had the whole city under its grip. Eager fans made a beeline for the city hotel where she was staying after landing from a Jet Airways flight from Delhi, only to be shooed away by vigilant police personnel. 

 There were four additional police platoons from outside the district, other than the district?s own force, and two platoons of the state armed police. But the crowds did not go overboard with enthusiasm.

 After a grand entry at 4.15 pm, Sania was joined on stage by mother Naseema, father Imran and sister Anam. A minute?s silence was observed in memory of tsunami victims before the welcome speeches.

 ?It?s a pleasure and a privilege to be back in Siliguri,? said Sourav. ?Sania?s only 18? Sometimes I wish I was 18,? the skipper quipped, before crowning her in gold.

 As the auction got underway, donations poured in from everywhere ? banks, merchants? associations, schools, gurdwaras?. Siliguri Municipal Corporation collected Rs 6.7 lakh, while the Siliguri Jalpaiguri Development Association gave Rs 2.5 lakh.

 Finally, at 5.45 pm, as Bappi Lahiri brought the curtains down with a dedication to tsunami victims, Sania and Sourav zipped out of the stadium in a red Chevrolet Tavera.

 ?I think this is the largest amount collected for tsunami relief through a single function participated in by sports persons,? said Bhattacharya. ?At first, we had targeted Rs 30 lakh. Then we raised it to Rs 40 lakh on seeing the turnout of the business community here. A final figure will emerge tomorrow. But it will cross Rs 55 lakh,? he said.

 ?It feels good to have Sania visit the academy,? said Sharmin Mukherjee, the institution?s chairperson and wife of Joydeep Mukherjee, the man behind the Himalayan Tennis Academy. ?Several children were willing to join the academy after her performances in Melbourne and Hyderabad. Now, with her visit in person here, they will be all the more encouraged to take up the sport,? she said.

 Poll hope for Subrata

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Asansol, Aug. 18: Former mayor Subrata Mukherjee, who suffered a humiliating defeat in the June civic-body elections, appears set to emerge out of political hibernation.

 The Congress is likely to field Mukherjee for the Asansol Lok Sabha seat where a by-election is to be held on September 28, after the death of CPM MP Bikash Chowdhury.

 Mukherjee had floated the Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha and contested the civic polls in alliance with the Congress. Last month, the former Trinamul mayor dissolved the Mancha and joined the Congress.

 The last date for submitting nominations for the civic polls is September 10 and for withdrawal September 14. Counting will be held on October 1.

 We have sent a proposal to the state Congress requesting the leadership to put up Subratada as the partys nominee for the Asansol bypoll. He will be a fit candidate for this industrial belt with his trade union background, Tapas Banerjee, the Burdwan district Congress chief, said this morning.

 Mukherjee said he had no problem entering the fray as a Congress nominee for the Asansol seat.

 I hail from Burdwan district. Moreover, with a strong trade union background, I am confident of wresting the seat from the CPM if elections are held free and fair, said the former mayor.

 However, Mukherjees detractors in the Congress feel he has little chance of winning the seat.

 The CPM leadership, on its part, is considering Bansagopal Chowdhury ? the minister for cottage and small-scale industries and an MLA from Ranigunge ? as a nominee for the bypoll.

 Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress is still undecided about its nominee for the Asansol seat. A sizeable section of Trinamul leaders in Burdwan favour Hirapur MLA Malay Ghatak, though he had lost the Asansol Lok Sabha seat in 2004 by over one lakh votes.

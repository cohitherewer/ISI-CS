 Ragging row at SSKM

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 5: Four second-year students of the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research at SSKM Hospital were suspended from the hostel on Wednesday for allegedly ragging a first-year student, Diptangshu Ganguly.

 The four students, who were asked to vacate the hostel immediately, were supporters of the All India Democratic Students Organisation and were instrumental in the agitation against capitation fees. A month ago, they had complained against alleged ragging by Manoj Mahato, a second-year student and an SFI supporter.

 A section of students have decided to gherao the director of the institute tomorrow and submit a memorandum in support of the accused.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Sept. 20: About 200 km of embankments in the two 24-Parganas have been destroyed by the flood last week, irrigation minister Biswanath Chowdhury said today.

 The flooding was caused by low pressure on the Bay of Bengal and high tide. More than 2,000 families had to be rescued from the submerged Sagar Island and Kultali, Mathurapur, Basanti and Namkhana. Some Rs 3.5 crore would be needed to rebuild the bunds, the minister said. 

 Santiniketan: Two Visva-Bharati students were arrested on Tuesday for being involved in a clash between Students Federation of India (SFI) and Chhatra Parishad supporters at the university hostel the night before. Supporters of the Congresss student wing, Chhatra Parishad, raided the Vidya Bhavan hostel with iron rods, sticks and wickets and beat up SFI supporter Saidul Islam. 

 Durgapur: Jiten Mondal, 17, who was picked up for allegedly stealing coal from an ECL truck, has died in custody. Police at Rupnarayanpur, 280 km from Calcutta, denied beating him and said they were awaiting the post-mortem report.

 Asansol: The chief minister will address a rally here on Wednesday. It is in support of small-scale industries minister Bansagopal Chowdhury, the CPM nominee for the bypoll to the Asansol Lok Sabha constituency.

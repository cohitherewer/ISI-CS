 Fellow accused cries torture

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Nov. 21: Adhir Chowdhurys friend and co-accused in the twin murders case, Tapan Kumar Basu, today said police were torturing him to try and extract a confession implicating the MP. 

 Basu, who was arrested in August, filed a writ petition in Calcutta High Court this morning charging the police in Behrampore with brutality. After their torture, I am not even in a position to stand. One of my ankles had to be operated on, Basu alleged.

 He demanded a CBI probe into his allegation. Let there be a CBI probe and penal action against the policemen who tortured me in custody, he demanded.

 Pratip Chatterjee, the lawyer representing Basu, alleged that during his stay in the police lock-up, he was pinned to the ground and kicked. 

 The faction-ridden Congress, however, appeared unsure about how to respond to the MPs arrest.

 There is pressure from certain quarters to call a Bengal bandh. We will discuss it at a meeting on November 27 in the presence of defence minister and state party chief Pranab Mukherjee, said Pradip Bhattacharya, the working president.

 He added that the bandh at this juncture would harm the interest of students appearing for tests in Madhyamik schools. 

 Congress sources said those owing allegiance to Union minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi are in favour of a shutdown by November-end. 

 Former mayor Subrata Mukherjee, MLAs Shankar Singh and Abdul Mannan and Youth Congress president Amitava Chakraborty belong to this group.

 However, those loyal to former state party chief Somen Mitra are believed to be opposed to the bandh. Mitra has so far stayed away from demonstrations the Congress supporters have staged against Chowdhurys arrest.

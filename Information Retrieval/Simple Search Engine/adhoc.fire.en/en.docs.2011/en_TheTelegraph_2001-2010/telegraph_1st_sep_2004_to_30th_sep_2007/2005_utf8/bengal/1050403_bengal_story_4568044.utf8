 Calls lead to arrest over ISI links

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, April 2: District police last night arrested two people suspected to be ISI agents from Damodarpur village near Malda town.

 The arrest comes less than a month after district police had nabbed ISI agent Eyaz Mohammed from Kaliachak in Malda. Eyaz was a member of al-Badr, police sources said about the March 19 arrest.

 Yesterday, the telephone department had informed the superintendent of police, Sashi Kanta Pujari, that Ram Kumar and Bipin Kumar had over the last two months made calls worth Rs 5 lakh to Pakistan, Afghanistan and West Asian countries.

 Police raided the house of Swapan Mondal at Damodarpur, where the two had rented a room for Rs 600 per month. Mondal and van driver Nakul Sarkar informed the police that the accused had procured two separate phone connections in Sarkar?s name.

 A team led by Malda?s additional superintendent of police then arrested the accused.

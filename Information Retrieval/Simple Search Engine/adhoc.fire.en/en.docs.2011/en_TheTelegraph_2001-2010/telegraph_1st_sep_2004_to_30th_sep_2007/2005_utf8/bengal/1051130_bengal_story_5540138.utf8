 Atish not with criminal MP

 - Dissent simmers in Congress

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sinha: Rebellious

 Calcutta, Nov. 29: A defiant Atish Sinha today said he will not take part in Congress protests against Adhir Chowdhurys arrest, though it would mean defying the party whip.

 The Congress legislature party leader said: Police have confirmed that Adhir has been named as an accused in the FIR lodged following the dou-ble murder in Behrampore town on July 23. Congress leaders and workers should not rally behind a criminal like him and, instead, allow the law to take its course.

 Sinha, an eight-time party MLA from Kandi in Murshidabad, is a known rival of the Behrampore MP. Understandably, he has stayed away from all the agitation in support of Chowdhury, in Calcutta or the district town.

 State party president Pranab Mukherjee had earlier said Sinha would have to face the consequences if he continued to defy the party line.

 Sinha sounded undeterred. I shall also boycott the December 3 rally on the Maidan, he said. A string of programmes on the Adhir issue is likely to be announced at the meet. 

 Earlier, Mukherjee had faced protests from a section of the party, including MLAs Subrata Mukherjee, Abdul Mannan and Shankar Singh, who called for action against Sinha at an executive committee meeting on Sunday. 

 Those owing allegiance to Union I amp;B minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi had demanded Sinhas expulsion.

 Sinha, however, called upon the leadership to delve deep into Adhirs past. Before ini-tiating action against me, they should go through the reports I had submitted a few months ago detailing how Adhir worked against the party. He put up candidates against official nominees in the May municipality polls in Kandi and damaged our prospects. Pranabda did not campaign there. Have they forgotten all that? 

 Threat mail: The CPI (Mao- ist) today denied having sent a threat letter addressed to judicial magistrate A.K. Mahapatra, who sent Chowdhury to jail on November 20. 

 The letter, found lying on chief judicial magistrate A.K. Pals desk, asked Mahapatra to grant bail to the MP. Mahapatra was on leave yesterday and Pal heard Chowdhurys case.

 Mud wall on highway to Sikkim

 Siliguri, Aug. 7: Traffic on National Highway 31A ? the main route to Sikkim and Kalimpong from here ? remained stuck today as the road blocked by a landslide two days ago is yet to be cleared. 

 An incessant downpour since yesterday morning has hampered restoration work on the busy highway at Swetijhora, 8 km north of Sevoke (Coronation) Bridge. 

 Officials of the General Reserve Engineering Force of the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), whose men are doing the job, said chunks of earth and small boulders are still coming down the hill slopes.

 The slide occurred around 5.30 pm on Friday. Given the weather, the road is likely to remain blocked tomorrow as well.

 The mountainside collapsed, causing a mud pile 30 metres high over a stretch of almost 100 metres, said a senior official of the BRO. 

 The stretch of the highway is prone to landslides, they said. Two bulldozers and other special vehicles that we have deployed on either side of the slide could not make much headway, as loose soil and rocks continued to roll down the slope and on the piled-up rubble, one of the officials said. 

 He added that if the rain continued, it was unlikely that the road will be cleared by tomorrow evening.

 Vehicles headed to Kalimpong and Gangtok from Siliguri are now plying through Damdim, Malbazar and Lava. The diversion means several hours more to reach the towns. Instead of the two-and-a-half hours, we are now taking almost five hours to make it to Kalimpong, said the driver of a Tata Sumo, which plies on the route.

 He said the journey is now costing Rs 1,800 one way with visitors having to traverse an extra 120 km. If the vehicle is shared, the cost is split between passengers.

 But for those in a hurry and not willing to pay extra, an adventure lies in store. 

 Vehicles, including a few buses, from Siliguri are going up to the landslide point, where passengers are getting off and trekking the mountainside rendered slippery by rain, above the mud block, through a forest. On the other side, waits another set of vehicles. 

 Two persons were injured today while trying it, said an officer of the Sevoke Road police station.

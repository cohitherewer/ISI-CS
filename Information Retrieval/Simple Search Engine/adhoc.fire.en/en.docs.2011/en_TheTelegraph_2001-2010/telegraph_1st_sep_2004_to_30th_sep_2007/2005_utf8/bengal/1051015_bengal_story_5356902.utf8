 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, Oct. 14: A 20-year-old woman was today found dead under three gunny bags full of rice with her three-year-old son sitting near the heap and crying. 

 Although Tanzima Bibis in-laws ? residents of Plassey in Nadia, 170 km from Calcutta ? had called her parents in Burdwan to inform about the death, none of them was there when her father Kasem Mallick and brother Kibria arrived. The Nadia police chief said he would seek a report from the Kaligunj police station OC, who initially refused to accept Kasems FIR.

 Calcutta: Minister of state for cottage and small-scale industries Narayan Biswas said on Friday police were to be blamed for not arresting him in connection with a 1988 rioting case. Despite a warrant issued against him by a district judge, Biswas has not been held. His anticipatory bail plea is pending with the high court. Biswas was allegedly part of a gang that torched 22 houses in erstwhile West Dinajpur. Sate police chief S.C. Avasthy said he was not even aware of the case. My juniors might be knowing about it.

 Calcutta: A former Indian Airlines employee was arrested on Friday for alleged involvement in a fake passport racket. Gurudas Sarkar, who retired in 2003, apparently ensured boarding passes for 13 people heading to Malaysia with fake passports early this month.

 Calcutta: Three youths died and one fell ill after consuming spurious liquor at Mahestala in South 24-Parganas on Friday. Police identified the dead as Mohan Singh, 20, Babu Sona, 23, and Bapi Khan, 25.

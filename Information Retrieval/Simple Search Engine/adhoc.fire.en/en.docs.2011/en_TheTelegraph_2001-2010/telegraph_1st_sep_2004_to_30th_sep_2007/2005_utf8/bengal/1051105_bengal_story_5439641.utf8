 Bones suffer bed break-down

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Nov. 4: A compound fracture patient who needs surgery immediately has nowhere to go in the two Midnapore districts but for private nursing homes.

 Orthopaedic surgeries at Midnapore Medical College and Hospital have stopped as both its specially-designed operation tables have broken down. One of them has been out of order for five months, the other since October 28. 

 About 100 surgery cases have piled up, but the hospital authorities pleaded helplessness saying they could not afford the funds required to repair or replace them. We dont have the money. The health department has been informed, said Lakshmi Kanta Ghosh, the hospital superintendent.

 We have eight operation tables of which two are specially designed and exclusively used for orthopaedic operations, he added. 

 About 12 patients were waiting to be operated on when the second table was rendered out of order on October 28.

 Many have already purchased steel plates and other things required for post-operative care spending thousands of rupees, said a surgeon. The plates might become contaminated if kept unused for long.

 Akul Ghosh, who broke his right hand a month ago, said: The doctors had asked me to come with a steel plate that would be fitted in my hand. I purchased one for Rs 13,000, but there is no surety when I will be operated on.

 Sanatan Pandits father needs an operation in his left leg. He was admitted to the hospital a month ago. He is staying there, otherwise other patients will get into the queue.

 None of them can afford treatment in a nursing home.

 The hospital superintendent said when both tables were in working condition, 50 surgeries were possible in a week. Since the first broke down, we were managing 15 to 25.

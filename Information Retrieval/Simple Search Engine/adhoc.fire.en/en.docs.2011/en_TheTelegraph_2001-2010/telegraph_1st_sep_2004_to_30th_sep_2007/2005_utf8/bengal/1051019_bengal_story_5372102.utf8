 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, Oct. 18: Banani Haldar, a 15-year-old girl who is supposed to take her HS exam in 2006, marched into the Dhubulia police station in Nadia on Saturday and lodged a complaint against her father.

 Police said Subrata Haldar, a group-D employee in the Dhubulia block hospital, 110 km from Calcutta, regularly beat up her mother, Namita, for money to buy booze. Namita is a nurse in the local TB Hospital.

 Banani, who scored 75 per cent in Madhyamik, said she wanted to see her father behind bars. She is finding it difficult to study and would not otherwise be able to do well in her HS, a police officer said.

 Calcutta: Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy called Enforcement Branch IG Nazrul Islam to his cabin on Tuesday. He apparently sought an explanation on his article criticising political interference in policing. 

 Calcutta: Outgoing chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee held an all-party meeting on Tuesday and sought co-operation for revision of electoral rolls. For the first time, Election Commission teams would be present during the process, beginning Thursday.

 Behrampore: Maqbool Ahanagar, a Kashmiri youth, and Sakina Bibi have been arrested from Ranitala and Tentulia in Murshidabad, 225 km from Calcutta, on charges of selling 14-year-old Shephali Khatun to flesh traders in the Valley. Police said the duo promised her a good job, but sold her off for Rs 20,000.

 Border faceoff continues

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Raiganj/Islampur, Feb. 28: The tension between the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) dragged into its third day with the Indian guards today clearing out two more villages fearing hostilities across the fence.

 BSF sources said attempts to get the deputy inspectors-general of both sides to sit for a flag meeting were ignored by the BDR. The outfits exchanged rifle fire late on Friday night after the BSF protested against the construction of an embankment within 150 m from the border.

 Even as the standoff continued, the North Dinajpur administration took strong exception to the fact that the BSF did not inform it about the tension along the border at Moragati, about 20 km from Islampur. District magistrate Manish Jain said: ?According to protocol, any development on the border that could lead to a law and order problem should be communicated to us. I am writing to the divisional commissioner about this.?

 Deputy inspector-general of the BSF, Kishanganj range, Pratap Singh Chandel said they were not bound to inform the district police about incidents along the border.

 Deserted villages and standing crops beyond the farmers? bounds continued to portray the prevailing situation.

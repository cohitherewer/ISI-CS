 Tech school head axed

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Sept. 12: The director of the National Institute of Technology (RE college earlier) here, A.C. Ganguly, was removed from the post today for alleged dereliction of duty.

 Sources said he had incurred the wrath of the institutes board of governors, comprising 12 representatives from the central and state governments, because of increasing hooliganism of students. 

 Some 200 of them attacked a restaurant-cum-bar in Durgapur town and beat up police officers, among others, on August 30 after being refused liquor beyond midnight. A dozen have been suspended.

 S.K. Chatterjee, a senior teacher, has been asked to take over as the director from tomorrow. The chairman of the board of governors, Ahindranath Roychowdhury, issued a directive to Ganguly asking him to hand over charge and continue as a metallurgy professor.

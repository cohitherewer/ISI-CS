 CM call for traffic recast

 Calcutta, Nov. 19: The chief minister today called upon Calcutta police to develop a better traffic system for the city that would ensure smoother flow of vehicles. 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee also asked the police to think up an alternative to hand-pulled rickshaws, which he felt was a shame of the 21st century and which he said should go in a couple of months.

 Inaugurating a programme to mark the beginning of a year-long festival for the forces 150 years at Nandan this evening, he said: The citys traffic system is crying for change. A proposal that suggests better signals, railings and zebra crossings has been submitted and my message to you is just go ahead. Funds would not be a problem.

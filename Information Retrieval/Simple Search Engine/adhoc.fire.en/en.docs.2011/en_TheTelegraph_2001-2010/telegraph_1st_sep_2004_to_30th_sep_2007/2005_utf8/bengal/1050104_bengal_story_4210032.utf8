 Sikkim opens door, just

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Gangtok, Jan. 3: Mountaineers now have 12 more peaks to choose from.

 Looking for ways to boost tourism, the Sikkim government has decided to open peaks within the state for climbing from the next tourist season.

 The ones considered sacred, like Kanchenjunga, are still out of reach, though.

 R.B. Subba, the state tourism minister, made the announcement at Mangan, the North district headquarters, while inaugurating a music festival a few days ago.

 Subba said: ?When I visited Europe for the World Tourism Meet recently, there were a lot of enquiries on mountaineering. During our presentation in London, Paris, Milan and Rome, tour operators said many mountaineers wish to come to Sikkim.?

 The government notification prohibiting climbs on Kanchenjunga (8,585m), considered guardian deity of Sikkim, and Siniolchu (6,887m), Kabru (north) (7,388m), Kabru (south) (7,317m), Rathong (6,679m), and Mount Narsing (5,825m) remains. Even for the peaks opened, the minister said mountaineers would ?not be allowed to cross 20,000 feet?. 

 A climber, who did not want to be named, said he was clueless about the reason behind the bar.

 Subba said: ?The North district collector will issue permits to domestic tourists going beyond Singhik in the north.? 

 Tourists can now go beyond Singhik to Yumthang, Lachung and Gurudongmar, for which permits were earlier issued by Sikkim tourism offices in consultation with the state home department.

 Subba said the government will appeal to the Centre to allow foreigners up to the Gurudongmar lake near the China border. ?We are also mulling skiing facilities at Gnathang in east Sikkim,? said Subba.

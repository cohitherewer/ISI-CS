 BRIEFS

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 24: Police are investigating the death of a 20-year-old woman whose body was found in a Puri hotel on Tuesday. 

 On Sunday morning, 25-year-old Rakesh Kumar Gupta from Malda checked into the hotel along with the woman, whom he presented as his wife. The woman was found dead in her room by the staff after Gupta had left the hotel. The police doubt if the two were married and suspect that the address given by Gupta (Nalanta Pali Road, Englishbazar, Malda) could be false.

 Durgapur: Police have framed kidnapping 

 charges against 20-year-old Tony Mian after his 16-year-old 

 neighbour Dolly Bhandari went missing on February 21. Dolly?s 

 father lodged a complaint on Wednesday and police suspect 

 Tony and Dolly have eloped. ?We have reason to believe that 

 the two have eloped after their families objected to their 

 affair. We have initiated a kidnap case against Tony as 

 the girl is a minor,? said police superintendent N. K. Singh. 

 Krishnagar: Twenty persons, including five children, fell ill after ammonia gas leaked from a cold storage here on Thursday evening. Two of them are candidates for the Madhyamik examination.

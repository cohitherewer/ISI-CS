 Tea truce bid fails

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 16: A tripartite meeting to end the ongoing tea garden strike failed today and the issue will now be taken before chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 Trade unions, tea garden owners and government officials met at Writers Buildings but could not find a solution as the strike entered its sixth day. Later, the unions decided to call a 12-hour bandh in North Bengal on July 19.

 Todays meeting failed to bring out any solution. So I will report the matter to the chief minister on Monday, labour minister Md Amin told reporters. The tea garden owners did not fulfil demands of workers and the unions also did not agree to the proposal of a Re 1 hike in their wages.

 The strike by 3.5 lakh labourers has crippled work in the states 350-odd tea gardens. 

 At yesterdays meeting, the employers had offered a raise of Re 1 in the daily minimum wages and asked for a five-year agreement on this. There is no question of accepting their proposal as we are demanding a minimum daily wage of Rs 88, said Manohar Tirkey, a former RSP minister and general secretary of the Dooars Tea Garden Workers Union.

 The workers now get a daily minimum wage of Rs 45.90. Tirkey said in the last agreement between workers and owners signed on April 1, 2004, there was a raise of Rs 11.

 The owners warned they would take a firm stand if the strike is not withdrawn by tomorrow. The tea industry is facing continuous losses for five years. How are they making such demands of steep hikes? said C.K. Dhanuka, chairman of Indian Tea Association. Workers must join work tomorrow, otherwise all our offers will be withdrawn.

 The industry was losing Rs 15 to 20 crore every day because of the strike, he said. If the strike continues, the accumulative loss will be Rs 150 crore by tomorrow.

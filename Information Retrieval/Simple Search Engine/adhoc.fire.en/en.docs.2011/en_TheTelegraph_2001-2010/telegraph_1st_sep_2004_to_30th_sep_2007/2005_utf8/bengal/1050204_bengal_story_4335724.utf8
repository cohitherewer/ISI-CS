 BRIEFS

 Purulia, Feb. 3: A mob of about 4,000 went on the rampage and set fire to a sponge iron factory this evening after a worker was found dead in the compound.

 A shed and an office of the plant at Baragram in Neturia, 250 km from Calcutta, were gutted and 13 people injured. Police said Santosh Bauri, 42, who went missing three days ago, was found partially charred in a well. The villagers alleged that before that he had a tiff with a security guard, who prevented him from entering the factory on January 30 as he was drunk. District magistrate Mukul Sarkar said a probe is on. 

 Calcutta: A trio was arrested from Raidighi in South 24-Parganas, about 90 km from Calcutta, and a tiger skin worth Rs 1 lakh seized. A forest official said a team of five posed as buyers to get to the cache.

 Midnapore: Two Citu factions clashed in Kharagpur on Thursday over control of the local industrial area. Rajiv Roy, a supporter of Mihir Pahari, a CPM zonal committee member who set up a makeshift ?party office? in the area, was beaten up and his motorcycle smashed. The office was set afire, alleged Pahari. In a complaint with the police, he blamed two party members for the attack.

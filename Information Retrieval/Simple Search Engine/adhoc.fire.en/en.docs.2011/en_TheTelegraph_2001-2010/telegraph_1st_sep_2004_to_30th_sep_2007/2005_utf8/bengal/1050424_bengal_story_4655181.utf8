 Bid time for big-time Dankuni township 

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 The model of a new township in Howrah: Way to go

 Calcutta, April 23: The government will set the ball rolling next week for a sprawling satellite township in Dankuni.

 A real estate boom has already hit the city and its eastern fringes and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s regime is ready to shift focus. 

 This 5,010-acre project will have all the ingredients of a modern self-sufficient township ? housing, education and entertainment facilities. About a thousand acres would be developed as an industrial hub. 

 The township in Hooghly district will be about 20-25 minutes from Dum Dum airport once the second Vivekananda Setu and the connecting expressway are completed.

 ?In the coming week, we?ll invite expressions of interest to develop the township through a public-private partnership,? urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said. The CMDA is monitoring the process.

 The township will have bungalows and housing complexes, hospitals, schools and colleges. An entertainment package ? multiplexes, entertainment parks, swimming pools and residents? clubs ? would also be included. The new township is expected to accommodate about 1.5 million people. 

 ?It would take Rs 15 to 20 lakh per acre for land acquisition and Rs 35 to 45 lakh per acre for the development. This is just the basic cost and it would depend on how the developer visualises the township?.? an official said. 

 The companies or consortiums would be shortlisted from among those who respond to the invitation for the expressions of interest. A committee headed by the principal secretary of the urban development department, K.S. Rajendrakumar, would examine the proposals. The companies would then be asked to offer technical and financial bidding. A company or a consortium of companies to develop the township will be selected on the basis of the bids. 

 The CMDA has already started the procedure for acquiring land. Once the private partner is selected, the land would be handed over in phases for development. ?We will ask the company to sell land in the industrial township at a reasonable price because we want to attract industry,? an official said. Industries to be housed there must be non-polluting. 

 With a logistics hub at Kona and some super expressways around it, Dankuni is set to witness a surge of growth. ?The township is meant to fulfil the need for an overall and even growth around Calcutta so that the city proper does not feel the increasing pressure of population,? the official said.

 Last November, the government took the Indonesia-based Salim and Ciputra groups around the proposed Dankuni site.

 Maoist suspect remand

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Nov. 5: Bhutanese refugee Vinod Mangar, arrested on charges of having links with Nepal Maoists, has been remanded in police custody for six days.

 Kurseong police arrested Mangar, alias Mani Kumar, from the Nurbong tea estate under Kurseong police station yesterday.

 The police said Mangar had been residing at the Khudnabari camp in Nepals Ilam district for the past 12 years. 

 For the past one and a half months, he was trained at Maoist training camps in Chisopani in Ilam. He received training along with 100 others, including three Bhutanese refugees. On October 29, he fled the training camp. He sneaked into India on Thursday, the motive behind which we are trying to establish, Darjeeling superintendent of police Rajeev Mishra said.

 Police have also launched a search for the three other Bhutanese refugees. We are getting in touch with Nepal police to investigate further, Mishra said.

 Kanchan Rai,18, another Bhutanese refugee who was picked up, has been released on bail. He said he had come here in search of work as a labourer. But we arrested him because he comes from the same camp as Mangar and was seen with him, Mishra said.

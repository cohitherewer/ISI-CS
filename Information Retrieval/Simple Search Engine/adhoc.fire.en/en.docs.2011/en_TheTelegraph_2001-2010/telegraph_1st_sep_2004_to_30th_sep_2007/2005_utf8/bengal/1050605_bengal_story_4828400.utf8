 Executive goes missing 

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Imphal, June 4: A 55-year-old senior executive of the National Building Construction Company has been missing ever since his flight from Imphal landed in Calcutta three days ago.

 At 6.30 am on Wednesday, deputy project manager Inderjit Vijh should have been emerging from the arrival lounge to greet friends waiting for him outside. But he had simply vanished.

 After waiting for more than an hour and a half, we began looking for him at different places but could not spot him, said a friend, Sukanta Dutta.

 A complaint has been lodged with the Airport police station and the North 24-Parganas police have launched a search.

 Vijh, brother of former Western Coalfields Limited chairman-cum-managing director Kailash Chandra Vijh, was a resident of Bilaspur in Madhya Pradesh. He was posted in Imphal and had taken leave from May 25 to June 30. 

 Vijh was to catch a train home from Howrah on Wednesday night.

 The officials friends today said they had called up his family in Bilaspur to be told by his wife Sashi that he hadnt reached home.

 In Imphal on Wednesday, a friend, Ravinder Singh, had travelled to the airport with Vijh to see him off. Singh left only after Vijh had entered the security check area.

 According to passenger details provided by Indian Airlines, Vijh had boarded flight IC-7128 and taken his seat, 5D. 

 We didnt notice anything unusual about any of the passengers who boarded the flight that day, said an airport employee in Imphal.

 We are looking into all the aspects of the case and it will take us some time to get a clearer picture, said Praveen Kumar, the North 24-Parganas superintendent of police.

 Vijhs friends in Imphal and his companys deputy general manager, S.K. Mittal, have been informed.

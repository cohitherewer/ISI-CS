 Adhir cries foul against fake arrests

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 6: A delegation led by Murshidabad district Congress chief Adhir Chowdhury today met home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy and complained that the police were implicating his party workers under false charges and arresting them at random. 

 The team, which included Behrampore municipality chairman Nilratan Auddy and Murshidabad zilla sabhadipati Siddiqua Begum, also met law minister Nisith Adhikary and director-general of police S.C. Avasthy. 

 Chowdhurys detractors in the Congress said the arrest of the MPs driver, a friend and three others in connection with twin murders in Behrampore in July might have prompted him to voice his protest.

 I will not comment on the matter. But when the government seeks a report from me on the MPs allegation about police harassment, I am ready with the answer, Murshidabad superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh said. 

 Calcutta: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said unlike Chattisgarh, his government would not ban naxal outfits formally. However, the administration is taking measures against the outfits, he added. 

 Calcutta: Defence minister and PCC chief Pranab Mukherjee will lead a padayatra from Canning to Belegachi in Baruipur on September 10 in protest against handing over of agricultural lands to the Indonesia-based Salim Group. In a related development, Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee will organise a Maha Micchil (grand procession) in central Calcutta on September 14 on the same issue.

 Kidnap drama for parents

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 3: Ranjan Chauhan has confessed to staging the kidnapping of his brother Rajat to broker peace between their parents. 

 On Friday, 16-year-old Rajat had disappeared from his Howrah home. 

 Police traced the teenager ? who had given his consent to the abduction ? this morning and arrested his brother and three accomplices.

 A police officer said the force had begun a hunt for Rajat after his parents lodged a complaint on Monday night. As many as eight police teams swung into action and some 400 flats in the neighbourhood were searched.

 After intense grilling last night, the 21-year-old Ranjan broke down and confessed. 

 He told us that he and his brother were tired of continuous arguments between their parents and had planned the fake abduction, Howrah additional superintendent of police Kalyan Banerjee said.

 The police raided the house of Bilu Das at Chaulia and found Rajat there. 

 Ranjan said he had been toying with several plots. Finally, the idea of abduction occurred to him. He thought that since Rajat was his parents favourite, the agony of his disappearance would bring them closer, Banerjee said.

 The day after Rajat went missing, his parents found a note from the kidnappers demanding Rs 5 lakh as ransom within 10 days. 

 That, too, was a part of the plan chalked out by the arrested four. They wrote the note to give the kidnapping more authenticity, Banerjee said.

 During interrogation, we found a number of loopholes in the entire kidnapping episode, said Banerjee.

 The police sniffed something fishy when the boys father Rajesh Chauhan received another ransom note on Tuesday. 

 That letter had a stamp of Ramkrishnapur post office dated July 30. How can a ransom letter be issued before the kidnapping? Besides, Rajat changed to a fresh T-shirt, wore his brothers new pair of leather slipper and took Rs 20 from his mothers purse before going out of the house. A kidnap victim doesnt get that much time and scope. 

 Second, the Chauhans are economically weak but the kidnappers demanded Rs 5 lakh knowing it was an impossible sum, said Banerjee. 

 The kidnapping was conducted with Rajats consent. But as he figures as the victim in the complaint, we will send him to the court to record his judicial statement, said Banerjee.

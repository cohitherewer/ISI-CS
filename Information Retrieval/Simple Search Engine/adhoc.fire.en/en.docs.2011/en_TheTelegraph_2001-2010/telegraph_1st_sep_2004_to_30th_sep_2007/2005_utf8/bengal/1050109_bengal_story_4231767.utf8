 No-trust move hits Cong body

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Behrampore, Jan. 8: The Congress, which holds 

all three Lok Sabha seats in Murshidabad district and also controls the zilla 

parishad, is tearing apart because of the heightening factional feud while the 

CPM is desperate to stem the rot in the organisation after suffering repeated 

setbacks in last year?s parliamentary and municipality elections.

 A section of Congress leaders have decided to move on Monday a no-confidence motion against Nilratan Auddy, the chairman of the Behrampore municipality ? all 23 seats of which are controlled by the Congress.

 The Murshidabad district administration fears that there might be trouble on Monday when 12 Congress commissioners of the municipality move the no-confidence motion and has decided to clamp prohibitory orders under Section 144 in Behrampore town.

 The motion is a fallout of the factional feud between two groups of Congress functionaries ? one belonging to the camp of local Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury and the other supporting Atish Sinha, the leader of the Congress Legislative Party.

 Auddy belongs to Chowdhury?s camp and the 12 Congress leaders who are moving the no-confidence against him are supporters of Sinha.

 Trouble started in November when the vice-chairman of the municipality, Pradip Nandi ? a staunch Sinha supporter ? was removed from the post after he had raised certain financial irregularities against the chairman. Congress sources said Auddy had reportedly given some contracts to a group that belonged to the Chowdhury camp.

 The sparring continued till December 31, when the 12 commissioners submitted a no-confidence motion against Auddy that was forwarded to the district magistrate, N. Manjunath Prasad.

 The subdivisional officer of Behrampore, Amit Chowdhury, will be present during the no-confidence motion on Monday.

 Police said Section 144 will remain effective in Behrampore town for 12 hours from 6 am on Monday. Rabindranath Tagore Road, close to the municipality will be closed that day to prevent people from entering the municipality and creating disturbances when the civic body hears the motion, said Prasad

 A group of youths today went to Gorabazar in Behrampore town and threatened traders to close the market on Monday, a police official said.

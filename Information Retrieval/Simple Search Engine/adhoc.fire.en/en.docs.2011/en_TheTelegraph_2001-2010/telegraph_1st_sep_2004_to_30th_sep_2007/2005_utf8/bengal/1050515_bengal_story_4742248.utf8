 Kerosene cola kills 4-year-old

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 14: Four-and-a-half-year-old Priyanka Sahani passed away late last night after battling death for a day since she consumed kerosene mistaking it for a soft drink. 

 A resident of BB Ganguly Street, Priyanka picked up a soft-drink bottle on Thursday evening and gulped down the liquid thinking it to be a cola. 

 With her father Subhas Sahani away and her mother not around, she felt uneasy but kept it to herself. When her parents returned around 9 pm, they found Priyanka lying on the bed. Minutes later, she started vomiting. With the empty bottle lying by bed, the parents realised what had happened and rushed her to RG Kar Medical College, said an officer of the Muchipara police station. She was unconscious by the time she was hospitalised.

 As her condition worsened, the parents shifted her to Peerless Hospital. When brought here yesterday, she was gasping.... The oil had entered the lungs, said a doctor.

 CPM young guns for Salim

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept 12: The CPM today deployed its young brigade to mobilise support for its industry drive.

 The Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) and the Students Federation of India (SFI) will hold a public meeting at Baruipur in South 24-Parganas on Thursday to rally support for the governments move to invite the Salim Group to set up shop and its decision to convert farmland for industry.

 However, at the meet, the youth and student leaders will also present a charter of demands to industries minister Nirupam Sen to ensure that they do not lose credibility by toeing the government line. 

 Topping that list would be a reminder of the farmers right to plough, even after their plots are taken over.

 Sen will be the main speaker at the rally. Two CPM ministers from the district ?Abdur Rezzak Molla and Kanti Ganguly ? and party MPs Sujan Chakraborty and Shamik Lahiri will be present. 

 This will be followed by a rally at Bhangar, also in South 24-Parganas, on September 25 in which the chief minister will address farmers. The government wants land at Bhangar for the Salim Group.

 Informed sources said the government will start acquiring land for the Salim projects in South 24-Parganas from the end-October. DYFI and SFI members will see to it that the process is carried out without any resistance. 

 Sujoy Mitra, the DYFIs South 24-Parganas secretary, said his outfit wants employment-oriented development. Ours is the second-poorest district in Bengal and the per capita income of our farm labourers is Rs 5 against Rs 18 in Burdwan. We support the governments initiative to set up industries because it will help our farm labourers.

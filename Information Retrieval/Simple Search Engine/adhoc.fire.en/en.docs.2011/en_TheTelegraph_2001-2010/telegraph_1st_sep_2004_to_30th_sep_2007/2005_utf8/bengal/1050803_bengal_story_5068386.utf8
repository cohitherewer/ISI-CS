 Techie gets back and away

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Chinsurah, Aug. 2: Sandip Nag, the Manila-based software engineer who went missing on July 22 while apparently on his way to his in-laws in Dankuni, returned last night.

 The Accenture employee came back from Bhubaneswar by Dhauli Express and reached his in-laws place around 1 am. He had a machh-bhaat dinner and went to sleep.

 Police had earlier said that Nag, 30, who had done mining engineering from BE College, Shibpur, had plotted his disappearance. When he SMSed his wife that he was about to reach her home, Nag was actually sitting at a travel agents office finalising his flight plan.

 His vanishing act was a throwback to the disappearance of Rajiv Bhattacharya, the London-based IT expert working with IBM, who went missing from Ultadanga and surfaced in Mughalsarai two days later unable to remember what happened to him. 

 On July 25, the police came to know that Nag had taken an Indian Airlines plane to the Orissa capital. We found his name on the passengers list of flight IC 7542 that took off from Dum Dum on July 24, a Serampore police officer said. 

 It was clear that Nag was in touch with his in-laws after the police traced his whereabouts. His brother-in-law Arup was there at Howrah station to receive him last night.

 Asked this morning why he had fled, he said: Amar bhalo lagchhilo na... mone holo ghure ashi (I was feeling restless... so I thought of going on a trip. About the message he had sent his wife, he said: I was joking. 

 Hooghly police chief Supratim Sarkar said: If he went on his own, what can we do? 

 His mother-in-law Sharada Panja said her son-in-law left for his Bankura residence along with his wife this afternoon. She added: He is an introvert and doesnt talk much. We dont know why he went away or where he went.

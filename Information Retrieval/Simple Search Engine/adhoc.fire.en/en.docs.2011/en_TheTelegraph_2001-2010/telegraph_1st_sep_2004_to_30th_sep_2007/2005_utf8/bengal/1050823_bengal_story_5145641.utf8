 Confined woman rescued

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 22: A team from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) today rescued 22-year-old Ayatri Sinha from her mothers house in Hooghly and handed her over to her husband Amal Majhi in Kolaghat in East Midnapore.

 Ayatri had lodged a complaint a few days ago saying that her mother Jayshree Sinha, a resident of Mogra, had forcibly kept her confined for about three weeks and was about to sell her to a brothel for Rs 1 lakh.

 Based on her complaint, the CID launched a probe and raided Jayshrees residence to rescue the girl today, said D.P. Tarenia, the deputy inspector general of police, CID. 

 Married to Majhi ? her tutor ? a few months ago, Ayatri alleged that her mother had confined her in her house, about 80 km from Calcutta, ever since she came for a visit. 

 When Majhi failed to rescue her, he lodged a missing diary and the CID was informed. Ayatri, too, managed to slip out of the house and lodge a complaint. Her mother, however, was in the dark about this, as she slipped back to the house. Ayatri managed to escape.

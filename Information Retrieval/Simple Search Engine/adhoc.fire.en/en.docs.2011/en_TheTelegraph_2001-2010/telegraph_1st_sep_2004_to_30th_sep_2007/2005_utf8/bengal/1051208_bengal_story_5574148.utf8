 Front victory

 Asansol, Dec. 7: The Left Front wrested the Kulti municipality from the Trinamul Congress-Congress alliance through a no-confidence motion on Wednesday.

 The motion was tabled by five dissidents ? three from the Congress and two from Trinamul. Out of the 34 votes cast by councillors of the municipality about 240 km from Calcutta, the front bagged 18 votes while the Congress-Trinamul combine got 16. A CPM councillor did not turn up.

 The dissidents resigned from their parties last month charging Trinamul chairman Ujjal Chatterjee with corruption.

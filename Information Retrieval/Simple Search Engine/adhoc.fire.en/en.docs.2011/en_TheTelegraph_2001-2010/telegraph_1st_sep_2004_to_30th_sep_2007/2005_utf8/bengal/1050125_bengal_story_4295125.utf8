 Cong brass call rebel

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bethuadahari, Jan. 24: The Congress high command has summoned Behrampore MP Adhir Chowdhury to Delhi in a bid to resolve the stalemate arising out of his tiff with rival factions and resignation as the Murshidabad party chief.

 At a rally here in Nadia, 130 km from Calcutta, Chowdhury today indicated unwillingness to revoke his resignation till the leadership took ?disciplinary action? against his detractors. He also told the gathering about the call from Birendra Kataria, the AICC functionary in charge of organisational polls in Bengal, asking him to be in Delhi on Friday.

 ?State Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee yesterday urged me to withdraw my resignation, but I have not taken a decision yet. I need more time to make up my mind,? he said.

 ?I have been held responsible for acts of omission and commission by Mirzaffars (traitors) in the party. I will place all facts and figures before the central leaders. Let them judge who is right,? he said. 

 The AICC general secretary looking after Bengal affairs, Ambika Soni, is expected to meet Chowdhury in Delhi.

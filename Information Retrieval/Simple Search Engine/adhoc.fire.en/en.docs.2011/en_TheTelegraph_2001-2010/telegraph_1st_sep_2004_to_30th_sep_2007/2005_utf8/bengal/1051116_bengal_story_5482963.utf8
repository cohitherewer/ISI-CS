 Darkness descends on Kallol

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 15: The run-up to the staging of Utpal Dutts Kallol by Subhas Chakrabortys ministry has not been smooth. Nor have been the shows in Salt Lake.

 The play, which began at seven this evening, was disrupted midway as the sports and youth affairs ministers pet stadium plunged into darkness. 

 The actors were on the make-shift ship serving as the stage when the lights went out on its deck. Seconds later, the lights went off in the galleries as well. For a minute, it was pitch dark, said one of the organisers, Tapan Samaddar, also a local municipal councillor who was among the audience of about 35,000 people.

 Although the organisers tried to play down the incident, sources said many among the spectators walked out even as the lights came back in about five minutes. 

 A state electricity board official said the power cut had nothing to do with its supply.

 This edition of Kallol has been plagued by problems since the planning stage. 

 First, city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee refused to give a go ahead to staging it on the Hooghly citing security reasons. On Monday, a snag developed in the sound system and the dialogues were almost inaudible in large parts of the stadium.

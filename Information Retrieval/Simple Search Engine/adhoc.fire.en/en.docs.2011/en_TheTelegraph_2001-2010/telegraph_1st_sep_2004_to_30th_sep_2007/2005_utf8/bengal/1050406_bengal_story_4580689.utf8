 Daughter trader driven out

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, April 5: The mother who had sold a daughter to flesh trade and was about to do the same with another was chased out of her village in Phulia after she obtained bail. 

 Neighbours in the Nadia village, 70 km from Calcutta, beat up Deepali Basak last month after her husband Joygopal overheard her scheming to sell 13-year-old Durga ? to become a bar dancer in Bihar ? and raised an alarm.

 On Friday, the villagers chased Deepali with sticks when they saw her. Deepali and her son?s mother-in-law, Asha Boral, who was part of the girl-running plot, were granted interim bail by the Ranaghat subdivisional court. 

 Joygopal had learnt from her conversation with Asha on March 22 that Julie, his 10-year-old daughter, had been sold to traffickers two days ago for Rs 5,000.

 Neither Joygopal nor son Sadhan, however, lodged a complaint against Deepali and Asha with the police. The bail they got, but the father and son made it clear they would not have anything to do with them.

 Deepali and Asha had been arrested along with two others, Kalpana Das ? who allegedly sold her 14-year-old daughter Shephali and 12-year-old niece Sandhya ? and Alaka Upadhyay. 

 Kalpana and Alaka went to unknown destinations after getting the bail. Deepali and Asha pleaded with the deputy chief of the village panchayat, Raghu Chatterjee, that they be allowed to stay. He asked the women to leave.

 Word about their presence had spread and scores of villagers came out with sticks to hound them away. ?We don?t want such criminals here. We don?t want to see their face,? said Chatterjee. No one knows where Deepali and Asha went after that. 

 Without their help, it would be difficult for the police to trace the girls. ?Our case is already difficult as no specific complaint has been lodged,? said Nadia police chief Benoy Chakraborty. The police now have to seek court permission before pursuing the search for the girls.

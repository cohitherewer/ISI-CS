 Promotion policy for police rank amp; file

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 24: Over 5,000 posts in the lower ranks of police will be abolished in what is being dubbed a ?progressive promotion system?.

 According to the government?s new policy, about 4,136 head constables in the armed and unarmed force and 1,760 naiks will be promoted to the rank of assistant sub-inspectors. The posts that will fall vacant after the promotions will subsequently be abolished. 

 This will take the number of ASI posts in Bengal police from 4,182 to 8,318. 

 ?It is a conscious decision to make the police an officer-oriented force,? said director-general Shyamal Dutta. 

 A constable, who has completed four years in service, will have to take two rounds of examinations. If he clears both, he will be eligible for promotion to the ASI rank. 

 Dutta said: ?The government wants to improve the scope of promotion in the lower ranks. A constable can now become an ASI after four years in the service.? There are 46,000 constables in the force now.

 However, a senior police officer put the policy change as a way of cutting costs in the long run. ?As so many posts are being abolished at one go and no new posts being created, it is obvious that the government will save money. A similar exercise was recently undertaken in the lower ranks of Calcutta police,? the official said.

 The police chief hoped promotions would ensure motivation and better service.

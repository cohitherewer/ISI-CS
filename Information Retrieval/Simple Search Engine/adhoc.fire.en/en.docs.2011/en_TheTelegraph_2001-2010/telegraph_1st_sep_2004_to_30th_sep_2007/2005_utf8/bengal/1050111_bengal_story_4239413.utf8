 Law revision for hotel

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 10: In its bid to corporatise the ailing Great Eastern Hotel, the government is set to do away with the body that now runs it. 

 The Great Eastern Hotel (Acquisition of Undertaking) Act 1980, which lays down the right of management of the over 150-year-old hotel, will have to be amended to abolish the Great Eastern Hotel Authority.

 ?Our consortium of consultants is examining the implications of such a step. As the hotel is under the authority, the structure (of the organisation) will have to be changed. Abolishing the authority and forming a company to look after the property and run the hotel is an option. A majority of the company?s shares could be offered to a private partner with the government holding the rest,? said an official.

 Top officers, who are key to the process, today discussed the procedure for the ?strategic transfer? of the hotel to a private partner. Chief secretary Asok Gupta, tourism sceretary Ashok Patnaik, finance secretary Samar Ghosh and public enterprises and industrial reconstruction secretary Sunil Mitra attended the meeting at Writers? Buildings this morning.

 ?As none of the bidders is interested in a long-term lease and most are looking for an equity partnership, corporatising the hotel seems a logical step,? said an official. 

 Today?s meeting decided on the conditions and principles of selection of bidders. ?We?ve suggested that emphasis be laid on their financial background and volume of investment,? the official said.

 The government is also working on guidelines for early retirement schemes for the 440 hotel employees. 

 An offical said: ?They will be notified in a day or two.?

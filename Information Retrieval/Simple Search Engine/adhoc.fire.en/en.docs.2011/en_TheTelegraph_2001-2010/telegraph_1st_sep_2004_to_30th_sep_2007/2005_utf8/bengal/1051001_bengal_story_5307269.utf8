 Calcutta, Sept. 30: Jyoti Basu today flayed CPM ministers in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees cabinet for their failure to utilise central funds for development projects.

 I have information that some ministers are so callous that they do not bother to utilise funds provided by the Centre for its schemes. As a result, unused central funds are being returned. It is a grave offence, Basu told a meeting at Alimuddin Street.

 The CPM brass had convened a meeting of the partys 29 ministers to review their performances and work out a plan for the future. 

 Three of them ? power minister Mrinal Banerjee, tourism minister Dinesh Dakua and minister of state for mass education Nanda Rani Dal ? however, could not turn up. 

 With months to go for the Assembly polls, the move appears part of a party policy to streamline the administration and ensure better governance.

 Besides Basu, the chief minister today spoke at length on the lapses in implementing core-sector ? health, education and power ? projects.

 Basu asked the ministers to ensure that central projects were implemented on time. 

 However, in the two-and-a-half-hour talks, several ministers resented finance minister Asim Dasguptas delays in disbursing Delhis funds. 

 The chief minister said he would see to it that the funds are disbursed without delay.

 Briefing the media later, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas said all party ministers have been asked to submit reports on their pending projects in one-and-a-half months. 

 They were asked to submit in writing their difficulties in implementing them.

 Biswas said the leadership today identified certain projects to be implemented on priority basis. The targets include bringing down the below poverty line population to 10 per cent and electrifying all villages by 2007.

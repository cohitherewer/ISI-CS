 Hospital head held

 Midnapore, July 31: The superintendent of Digha State General Hospital, Naba Kumar Pal, was arrested last night on charges of misappropriation of funds. 

 Yesterday, health service director Prabhakar Chatterjee visited Tamluk and asked East Midnapore chief medical officer of health Subrata Dutta to seize all books of account of the hospital. Pal has been in the post for over two decades. 

 A health official said he had not provided any explanation in the books of account regarding the revenue earned from people admitted to the hospital and those who consulted doctors at the outpatient department. The hospital superintendent purchased anti-rabies and anti-venom serum worth about Rs 7 lakh in February and March. But the vaccines are gathering dust in a godown. We have reason to believe that he had earned kickbacks for the orders, said zilla parishad chief Niranjan Sihi. 

 Pal was produced in court today and remanded in police custody for a week.

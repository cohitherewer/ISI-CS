 Criminals at fingertips 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, March 1: Don Aftab Ansari in Calcutta, extortion kingpin Anis Amjad alias Fajlu in Mumbai or Archana Balmukund Sharma, one of Pune?s most-wanted ? if you are looking for a link, try the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) headquarters. 

 In a leap to new-age crime detection and hi-tech monitoring of criminals, the CID is set to put in place one of an advanced ?criminal tracking system? that would enable sleuths to log on to a database of India?s most wanted. 

 With a tag of Rs 59 lakh, the system will come with a fingerprint analyser that will have a record of the most hardened hands in the crime scenes of the four metros and Pune, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Lucknow and Thiruvananthapuram. 

 The CID has already been approved of a government support of Rs 60 lakh for the project and work has begun to put the system in place. 

 ?It would allow us to tap a digitised database on the dossiers of criminals across India and crosscheck their fingerprints. It can work both ways. If required, we could also support other states,? said additional director-general of police (CID) R.K. Mahanty. 

 A server would connect to an online data bank on fingerprints, criminal antecedence and identification marks. 

 The need to log on to a hi-tech crime detection system was first felt after the theft of Tagore?s Nobel medal from Santiniketan. Armed with a slipshod infrastructure, the CID collected fingerprints of one Sunil Bagdi, a local criminal, and went on to say that it matched with those collected from the theft site in the Rabindra Bhavan museum. 

 The CBI later claimed that was not true. The loss of face remained a key instigator as the CID presented its case before director-general of police Ajay Prasad.

 But the CID would probably get more than it had bargained for. Decks have been cleared for the procurement of a string of other gadgets to beef up the department struggling to keep up with advancements in technology to tackle crime. 

 Among them are a computerised polygraph machine and technology to monitor all vehicles registered in the state.

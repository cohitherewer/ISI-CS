 Tea estate shut after unrest

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Oct. 22: The management of the Thanjhora Tea Estate declared a lockout late last night following Thursdays incident in which seven managerial staff were held hostage for 19 hours without food and water and beaten up over delay in the payment of wages. 

 The management issued a notice declaring suspension of all operations in the garden, around 30 km from here. There was no other way but to declare a lockout for an indefinite period, that is, as long as the work atmosphere is not restored, said N.K. Basu, principal adviser to the Indian Tea Planters Association, of which the tea estate is a member.

 The management had earlier asked for three days time because a bank draft for the workers wages had not arrived from Calcutta. The officials taken hostage were released after the management cleared the dues last evening.

 However, workers alleged that trade union leaders had sold out to the management.

 Sambhu Pandey, the secretary of West Bengal Cha Mazdoor Sabha, said he was under police protection. Armed workers have attacked eight of our leaders since last night and we are running for our lives.

 Battle for land

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Durgapur, Feb. 23: A couple based in Calcutta today took the first step towards reclaiming a five-bigha plot from the clutches of CPM-backed encroachers after 16 years of legal battle following Calcutta High Court?s intervention. 

 The Burdwan district administration handed over the plot, at Bamunnara village in Kanksa, about 180 km from Calcutta, to Amit Pan, a special officer appointed by the high court. 

 Pan will submit a report to the court on Friday, and the couple hopes to get possession once fresh orders are issued on the basis of the report. 

 A large posse of Rapid Action Force personnel was deployed in the area, where prohibitory orders were in force since yesterday, when the papers were handed over to Pan as two earlier attempts to evict the settlers had failed. The administration today demolished illegal huts and shops on the plot and drove out the 25 families living there. 

 Shortly after Mitali Goswami and her husband Sushanta, residents of Behala, bought the plot in 1989 from the former CPM legislator of Durgapur, Tarun Chatterjee, it was taken over by the encroachers.

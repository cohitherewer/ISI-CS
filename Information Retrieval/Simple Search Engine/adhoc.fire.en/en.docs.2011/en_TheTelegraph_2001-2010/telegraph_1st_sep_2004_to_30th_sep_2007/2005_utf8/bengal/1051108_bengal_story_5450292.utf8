 Jail exit eludes CPM leaders

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Balurghat, Nov. 7: Former minister Narayan Biswas will have to remain in custody till November 16 with a court here rejecting his appeal for bail in a 26-year-old case of looting. 

 Biswass party colleague, former secretary of the CPMs South Dinajpur unit Manabesh Chowdhury, will have to cool his heels behind bars till November 28.

 Additional district judge Anindita Roy Saraswati sent Biswas to judicial remand till November 14 in the 1979 case in which he was accused of looting paddy and ransacking a house in Kestopur, a village in Gangarampur subdivision.

 Biswas, however, will have to remain in jail till November 16 when the Ratanpur arson case of 1988 comes up for hearing once again.

 The arrested CPM men were brought to the court from the jail a little after 10 in the morning in a police van. Biswas and Chowdhury were seated in the drivers cabin, and not at the rear with other undertrial prisoners.

 Chowdhury and Niren Biswas, brother of the arrested former minister, will have to stay in jail for some more time with additional district and sessions judge Mir Hasmat Ali rejecting their bail applications. 

 Bail was refused in all the cases as those accused had failed to surrender for a long time. The judges also did not pay any heed to the appeals by the lawyers representing the CPM leaders that their clients were not sent notices, either about the warrants or that their property was to be attached.

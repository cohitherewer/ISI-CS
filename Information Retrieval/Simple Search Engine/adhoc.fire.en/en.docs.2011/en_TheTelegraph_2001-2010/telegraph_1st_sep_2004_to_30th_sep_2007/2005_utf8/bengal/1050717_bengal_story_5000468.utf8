 Teesta contractors cry foul 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, July 16: Speaking out for the first time since the arrest of 12 engineers and five contractors on charges of misappropriating funds, the Teesta Barrage Contractors Association today said the contractors were dragged into the case without reason.

 Association secretary Subhas Pal told a news conference that an FIR lodged with Mal police station in July 1998 said the contractors had been overpaid in connivance with engineers.

 Later, an arbitration was carried out under an order of the high court. The arbitrators, after a detailed study, reported that the irrigation department owed about Rs 6 crore to the contractors, he said. How can the question of overpayment arise? he asked.

 Arunoday Banerjee, one of the 12 engineers arrested by the enforcement branch, died in judicial custody in Jalpaiguri last week. 

 Nine engineers are in custody in Jalpaiguri and two in Calcutta.

 Pal alleged that the arrests could be a ploy on the part of the government to delay the payment of the contractors dues.

 The association, however, admitted that a section of the contractors and department officials was corrupt. 

 But the whole contractor community should not be blamed for the fault of a few, said association president Biplab Das. We want a proper investigation carried out and the guilty punished.

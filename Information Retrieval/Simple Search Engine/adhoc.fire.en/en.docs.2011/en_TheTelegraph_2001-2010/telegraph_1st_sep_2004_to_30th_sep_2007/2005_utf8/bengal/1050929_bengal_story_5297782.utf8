 BRIEFS

 Bankura, Sept. 28: A fourth-year student of Bankura Sammilani Medical College, Arijit Pal, was found hanging from the ceiling of his hostel room this afternoon.

 Arijit was a boarder of the B.C. Roy Hostel of the medical college, 220 km from Calcutta. He shared the room with two other students. Police said Arijit, a resident of Chakdah in Nadia, hanged himself between 1 pm and 1.30 pm when students were in the dining hall. When his room-mates returned, they found the door locked from inside. On peeping into the room from a crack in the door, they saw Arijit hanging.

 Calcutta: Mamata Banerjees efforts to bring together Opposition parties against the CPMs decision to hand over farm lands to the Salim Group suffered a jolt with the Congress deciding not to join her programme slated for Sunday. PCC working president Pradip Bhattacharya on Wednesday informed Mamata that it is not possible for the Congress to share a platform with the BJP. 

 Asansol: Stray incidents of violence marked Wednesdays byelections to the Asansol parliamentary seat. Chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee said in Calcutta that he had suggested to the poll panel to order a re-poll in booth 55 of Burnpur. The byelection follows the death of CPM MP Bikash Chowdhury.

 Suri: B.P. Saha, a sub-inspector of Sainthia police station of Birbhum has been suspended on charges of dereliction of duty after a dacoit escaped from the police lock-up on Monday.

 Quiet wedding 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 11: Rajiv Bhattacharya, the London-based IBM employee who went missing last week, will have a low-key wedding, his family said today. 

 Around 100 select guests will bless the couple tomorrow evening at a hotel in the Park Street area. 

 Rajiv will be tying the knot with Suparna Chakraborty eight days after their marriage was called off following his mysterious disappearance from Ultadanga.

 The Bhattacharyas said the guest list this time has shrunk as the wedding date was fixed in a hurry. We just ran out of time. It will be a small, low-key affair with a select gathering. Well think big probably sometime later, said Partha Banerjee, Rajivs brother-in-law.

 Family sources said the ceremony will begin around 6.30 pm, when Rajivs parents will escort the groom to the mandap to be set up in the hotel. 

 Ever since the marriage was finalised, the family has kept Rajiv under a watchful eye, not even allowing him to step out of the house. Some of his relatives have apparently urged him to defer his trip to London, now scheduled for June 13.

 For the police, the chapter is closed. With investigations proving that Rajiv was not abducted, they are not trying to dig any deeper. Our best wishes remain with him, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division).

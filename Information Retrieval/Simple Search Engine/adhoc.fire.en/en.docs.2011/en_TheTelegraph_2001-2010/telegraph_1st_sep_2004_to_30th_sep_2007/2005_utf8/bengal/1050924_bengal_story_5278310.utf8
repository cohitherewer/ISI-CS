 Showcause to minister

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Asansol, Sept. 23: Days before the byelection to the Asansol Lok Sabha constituency, CPM candidate and cottage and small-scale industries minister Bansagopal Chowdhury was today showcaused for violating the model code of conduct.

 Chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee said in Calcutta Chowdhury had used unauthorised cars for an election rally on Wednesday that was addressed by the chief minister. He has been asked to reply to why the unauthorised cars were used for the rally, Banerjee added. 

 Officials said 21 cars were seized from the rally site as they did not have the necessary permits.

 The CPM leadership admitted to having received the notice. Dilip Sarkar, a district committee member and Chowdhurys agent, said the commission cannot impose such unlawful guidelines.

 The bypoll, slated for September 28, was necessitated by the death of MP Bikash Chowdhury of the CPM.

 Salim push to Mamata front

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 2: Mamata Banerjee today renewed her bid to bring together all anti-Left forces on the Salim issue.

 We must accept the reality. Unless the Opposition forces are united, the communists will continue to reign even after 28 years. So, we should shed differences and come together to ensure the CPMs defeat, she told a convention at Nazrul Mancha.

 Buoyed by the turnout, the Trinamul Congress chief announced that Opposition leaders would meet on October 20 to discuss a joint movement against the governments decision to hand over farmland to the Salim Group in the two 24-Parganas for setting up industries.

 A joint movement will help us bolster the anti-CPM platform, Mamata said. 

 She also warned that any attempt to take away land from farmers would be opposed. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees police will have to kill me before depriving a poor farmer of his land in any Bengal district, she said.

 The government had earlier said that it will only take over fallow and mono-crop land in lieu of adequate compensation.

 Mamata had invited leaders of various Opposition parties, including the Congress, and even the CPMs Left Front partners to the convention, hoping to stitch together a front opposed to the governments industrialisation policy. 

 However, no senior Congress leader turned up, nor did any of the front partners. 

 Former state Congress chief Somen Mitra, who is believed to have toned down his hostility towards Mamata, did not attend the convention, though he had earlier said that he might. 

 But one of his men, former state Congress general secretary Kumud Bhattacharya, was present, triggering speculation about the possibility of a coming together.

 Defence minister and state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee had turned down Mamatas invitation, presumably after coming to know that the state BJP president, Tathagata Roy, would attend the meeting.

 I joined the convention as an ordinary Congress worker. Being in the Congress for over 40 years, I have realised that we should use the opportunity to strengthen a movement against the CPM in collaboration with Mamata on the Salim issue, Bhattacharya told the gathering.

 Some in the gathering had come armed with ploughs and sickles to establish their farmer identity.

 That the Congress and Trinamul could bury some of their differences was evident from what Abdul Mannan, a senior Congress leader and a party MLA from Champdani in Hooghly, said later: We should join forces with Mamata at this point despite the BJPs presence on the dais.

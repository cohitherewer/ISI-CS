 ?Equity? shows a harsh edge

 Calcutta, Feb. 8: The champion of the downtrodden complained today about having to sacrifice funds for those who are in greater need of central financial support. 

 Addressing the executive committee members of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industries (Ficci), Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee questioned the rationale for the formula adopted by the Twelfth Finance Commission for distributing central funds to states.

 ?The per capita income in the state is slightly higher than the national average, which means we are performing better. But we are being penalised for that,? the chief minister said.

 He mentioned a figure of Rs 200 crore as the so-called loss the state would suffer but did not specify under what head or over what period.

 Bhattacharjee added that he had raised the points during his meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday.

 Later, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said: ?The growth of state income has been impressive and we have also been able to contain growth in population and that is why our per capita income figure is higher. Despite the better performance, there will be an absolute fall in receivables for the state.?

 ?Receivables? is jargon for central funds for the state.

 Dasgupta has explained the government?s concerns to finance minister P. Chidambaram. ?The finance minister has asked me to give him a proposal in writing and I will send it to him in a week..,? he said.

 Although the commission recommendations are yet to be made public, the guiding principle for resources devolution has tilted the balance towards smaller states and those in the lower rungs of the development ladder. 

 With ?equity? considerations ruling devolution of funds, Left economists have broadly expressed happiness with the recommendations.

 Bhattacharjee did express reservations about the commission?s recommendations, but he also made it clear to industry captains that the Left would not create any major problem for the Centre. ?The common minimum programme of the government has been drawn up on the basis of consensus and we will support the initiatives on those lines. There are areas, where we have differences, but we have agreed to disagree and not destabilise,? said Bhattacharjee.

 Earlier, Ficci president Omkar S. Kanwar made a presentation on Bengal. He cited examples where Union ministries have extended support to various state government initiatives to establish that there was an excellent working relationship between Bengal and Delhi. 

 From commerce minister Kamal Nath?s promise of allocating funds for cold storage chains to human resource development minister Arjun Singh?s commitment of setting up a national institute of science in Calcutta, Bhattacharjee rolled out a long list to indicate a new era in Centre-state relationship. 

 ?We are also planning a logistics hub in the sate and seeking central support for the project,? he added. 

 Be it for specific projects or for debt relief, the chief minister?s focus was on getting more funds from Delhi. This formed the context for his comments on the finance commission recommendations.

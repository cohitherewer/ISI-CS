 Molest charge on headmaster

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 12: The headmaster of a school in south Calcutta was arrested last night on the charge of molesting an 11-year-old student. He was produced in court today and was granted bail. 

 The incident took place after school hours on Wednesday. 

 Police took action after the girls mother lodged a complaint at Lake police station. The 11-year-old was allegedly molested in an empty room on the school premises. 

 On Wednesday afternoon, the headmaster was taking a class. He scolded her for disturbing the class. The girl has claimed that after classes were over, the headmaster called her to an empty room on the pretext of talking to her and molested her, said an officer of Lake police station.

 The girl returned home in the evening, but was initially mum about the incident. Late in the night, she broke down and confided in her mother. A formal complaint was lodged the next morning and on Friday, the police picked up the headmaster from his Regent Park house. 

 Local residents and guardians of students today staged a protest on the school premises against the teachers misconduct.

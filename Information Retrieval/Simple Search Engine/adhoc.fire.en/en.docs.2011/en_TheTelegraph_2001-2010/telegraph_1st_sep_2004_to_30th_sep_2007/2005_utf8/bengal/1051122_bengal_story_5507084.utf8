 Behrampore, Nov. 21: The importance of being Adhir Chowdhury in Murshidabad is on full display at Behrampore Central Jail.

 A dispensary adjacent to the jail hospital has been renovated and converted into a cell for keeping the Congress MP, arrested from New Delhi on Saturday on charges of dual murder. 

 ?Please treat me as a normal prisoner and give me the food served to others. I do not want any special treatment,? Chowdhury had told the jail authorities after reaching there yesterday afternoon.

 But the treatment he is receiving now is anything but normal. The dispensary was given a fresh coat of paint and was kept ready before the arrival of Chowdhury and he does not have to share it with any other inmate.

 Instead of the regulation prison food, Chowdhury is allowed sumptuous meals brought by his aides from the house of his in-laws.

 For dinner yesterday, Chowdhury had rotis, French fries, chholar dal ? all piping hot ? and mineral water, courtesy his in-laws?. 

 For breakfast, the MP had rotis, vegetables and firni. 

 Lunch was also served by the in-laws and he ate substantial portions of rice, dal, posto, cauliflower and pabda curries. 

 One of his confidants, Gopal Chandra Dey, is in charge of supplying the food. Two-litre mineral water bottles and packets of 555 brand of cigarettes were provided to him at regular intervals, a source said. 

 Anup Tripathi, the deputy inspector-general of prisons, said: ?We are allowing food from outside as per doctor?s advice. The jail code permits that. Undertrials can be provided food from outside if they want. But it has to be checked by a jail doctor and that rule is being followed in this case.?

 Through the day, Chowdhury held court in the so-called cell and the jail superintendent?s office where he met a host of visitors, including senior party leaders. 

 First to meet him was Murshidabad zilla parishad sabhadhipati Siddika Begum. ?Adhirda, do not worry. We will get you free soon,? Begum said.

 Former Calcutta mayor Subrata Mukherjee also called on Chowdhury. 

 Fast-track court judge Narendranath Roy today issued a notice asking the MP to appear in his court on December 2 in connection with three murders that took place on August 3, 1985, at Khagra in Behrampore town. Chowdhury has already been remanded in jail custody till November 28 over the double murder on July 23.

 Arrest protest

 Trouble again broke out in parts of Murshidabad, South Dinajpur, Howrah and Calcutta today as Congress supporters confronted police to protest Chowdhury?s arrest.

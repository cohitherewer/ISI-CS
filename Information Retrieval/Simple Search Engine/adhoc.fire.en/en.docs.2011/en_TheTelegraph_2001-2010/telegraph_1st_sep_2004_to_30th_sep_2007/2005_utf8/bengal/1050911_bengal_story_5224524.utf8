 Stick for BE students

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 10: Authorities at Bengal University for Engineering and Science, Shibpur, have decided to take disciplinary action against 40 students allegedly involved in Thursday nights fracas that left two students injured.

 Indra N. Sinha, the registrar, said the dean of students has been asked to prepare a report on the unrest and submit it to the authorities on Monday. 

 After we get the report, we will decide our future course of action, but we are not sitting quiet on the issue, he said.

 Varsity officials said at least 40 hostel students were identified as being directly involved in Thursdays trouble. It is almost certain that they will be punished because the varsity cannot afford to let them off and encourage other students to get involved in such unrest in future, he said. 

 The students guardians could be called or they could be suspended and fined.

 Around 11 pm on Thursday, a fight broke out in hostel number 11 when students were having a feast. We are yet to understand the real cause behind the unrest, a varsity official said. 

 The unrest spread to other hostels quickly as boarders fought for nearly seven hours on the campus. College authorities had to bring in the police to stop the ruckus. After this, all undergraduate students were asked to vacate the hostels.

 The fight is believed to be a fallout of rivalry between two students unions.

 Campus interviews scheduled for Friday had to be cancelled because of the unrest.

 Sinha said the problem is unlikely to continue beyond the middle of next week. Efforts are on to solve the problem quickly.

 However, bearing in mind the future of innocent students, the institute has decided to arrange the campus interview on September 12 on the campus of Institute of Engineers (India) on Gokhale Road in Calcutta. Sinha said around 60 students will appear for the interviews. 

 The campus looked deserted today with almost all hostels nearly empty, except for some post-graduate and outstation students. 

 The mess is closed as there are no students. We are eating in restaurants outside the campus. We are afraid our academic career may bear the brunt, said a fourth-year student of mechanical engineering hailing from Nagaland.

 I had a talk with my family following the fighting. Since I am scheduled to visit home during the pujas, I dont want to go home now. It is scary to stay in this big place almost alone, said a post-graduate female student of electrical engineering, who is from Tripura. However, Sinha said security people are keeping a strict vigil on all hostels and there is no threat to any of the inmates.

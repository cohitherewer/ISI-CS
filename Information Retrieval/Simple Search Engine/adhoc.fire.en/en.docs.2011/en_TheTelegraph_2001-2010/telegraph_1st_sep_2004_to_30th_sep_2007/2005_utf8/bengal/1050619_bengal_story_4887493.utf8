 Doctor seeks shift after outcry

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, June 18: Gouranga Sardar, the doctor at a Murshidabad health centre who refused to treat a child at five yesterday morning, has decided to shift to another hospital following public outrage after the eight-year-old died.

 Bidhan Mondal died in his fathers arms under a tree at the Sagarpara health centre at Jalangi waiting for the clock to strike 9. Sardar had told the childs father, Bimal, to bring the boy ? writhing with stomach cramps ? to the outdoor at 9-9.30 am and slammed the door.

 A while later, Bidhans body went limp as mother Bandana looked on.

 A mob of about 3,000, drawn by the wails of the childs parents, then encircled the health centre, about 260 km from Calcutta, hurled stones, destroyed property and threatened to lynch Sardar.

 Sardar was not available for comment, but the districts chief medical officer of health, Sachchidananda Sarkar, said the doctor wants to leave the hospital. Although Sardar is yet to meet me himself, his elder brother had called me up from Calcutta to say that he is apprehending an attack by villagers, Sarkar said. If Sardar wishes, I can transfer him.

 Sarkar said the Domka subdivisional chief medical officer of health, Bhawani Prosad Shaw, will submit a report after a detailed inquiry.

 Health department officials in Calcutta said a report has been sought from the chief medical officer of health. The doctor will be brought to book if he is found guilty of negligence, said an official, adding that health minister Surjyakanta Mishra has been informed.

 The official said a circular had been sent to all government-run hospitals across the state to treat patients whenever they report to the outdoor departments.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, April 6: The renewed offer of Early Retirement Scheme to the Great Eastern Hotel staff seems to be bearing fruit. Three employees gathered the courage to enquire about details of the scheme within two hours of the new ERS notice being put up. 

 The government has issued the offer for the second time, sensing a change in the mindset of the hotel?s workforce. According to officials, all three employees are elderly. Hotel authorities described their move as a ?positive sign?.

 Krishnagar: As many as 17 boys, aged between 6 and 10, have escaped from the Chandranath Basu Home for Orphans, a state-aided shelter at Shyamnagar in Nadia district, 150 km from Calcutta. Three of them were caught by the railway police when they tried to board a local train. 

 Midnapore: Ration dealers have declared that come Friday, they will stop supplying foodgrain to people living below the poverty line in Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura districts. The dealers allege that they have not received the commission that the government had promised them for selling foodgrain at subsidised rates.

 Durgapur: Tension ran high at Gandhi More in the heart of Durgapur town on Wednesday when a lorry carrying acid hit another acid-laden lorry parked on the road. The acid started leaking and residents felt a burning sensation in their eyes and throat from the fumes. A dozen of them had to be rushed to the subdivisional hospital. Traffic came to a standstill on the busy road for a few hours. 

 Calcutta: Officials of the enforcement directorate seized 37,720 forged textbooks of Classes I to VI from a godown on M.G. Road on Wednesday evening.

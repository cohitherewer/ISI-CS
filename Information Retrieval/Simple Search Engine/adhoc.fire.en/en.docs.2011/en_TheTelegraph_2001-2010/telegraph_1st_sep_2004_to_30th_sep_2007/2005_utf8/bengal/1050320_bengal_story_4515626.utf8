 No home or job, minor refuses abortion

 MADHUMITA BHATTACHARYYA

 Mishtu: Future uncertain

 Calcutta, March 19: ?My child hasn?t sinned. I have.? Mishtu (not her real name) is sure she has done wrong. But exploited, abandoned and alone, barely 15, she is determined to take care of the baby that swells her stomach.

 The case that has reached the state child welfare committee and the state women?s commission is symptomatic of a social setup with a porous safety net for people like Mishtu.

 At 14, the illiterate girl from Midnapore, then a domestic help in Howrah, was fooled by words of love from Shantanu Maiti, a 26-year-old man who promised to marry her. She couldn?t resist the hand that forced her towards the Botanical Gardens where, over a period of months, he had sex with the girl. When she did find the voice to protest, a death threat kept her quiet.

 Once she started showing, the family for which she worked and their neighbours tried to pressure Shantanu to marry the girl. ?He didn?t want to because he was educated and the girl was completely illiterate and from a very poor family,? explained Sumanta Bagchi, in whose home Mishtu had worked for the past four years.

 If Shantanu could be found, Mishtu would still marry him. ?What option do I have? Where will I go with my child?? asked the teenager now in the care of a central Calcutta charitable organisation.

 When her employers realised that Shantanu wasn?t going to marry the girl, they took her home to Ramnagar. ?My parents turned me out. They didn?t want the neighbours to know,? recalled the frail girl.

 On March 14, Bagchi took Mishtu to Shibpur thana, where he lodged an FIR, under section 376 (rape) and 420 (cheating) of the IPC. Then he called Childline, the child emergency service run by Don Bosco Ashalayam. The following day, a social worker arrived at the Bagchi residence. Mishtu?s written statement was taken again and she was handed over to Childline, which sent her to the shelter.

 Mishtu doesn?t want to give up her child, expected soon. ?I went to the doctor on Wednesday for the first time. He said the baby?s head is on the right and feet are on the left,? she smiled.

 The minor is scheduled to have an ultrasonography soon. ?They will take pictures of my stomach,? she said. The baby has been kicking, and hard.

 Mishtu doesn?t know why her parents gave her up. She used to live with her basket-weaving family, including three sisters and six brothers, for the first few years of her life. ?I was in school. Then one day the master beat me up so badly my arm was swollen for days. I never went back.?

 Soon after, her mashi took her away. Four years ago, Mishtu started work at the Bagchi residence. ?Everyone in the neighbourhood loved me,? smiled Mishtu.

 That is all past. Soon, this confused child with no home or job will have an infant of her own.

 Poultry funds on platter

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Calcutta, Nov. 27: The bird flu may have ruffled China and Japan, but Bengals feathers are in place.

 In the next two years, the states poultry sector will witness an unprecedented inflow of investment ? worth nearly Rs 400 crore.

 Poultry trade officials today said half-a-dozen national and international players have finalised plans to set up units across the state to cash in on the burgeoning demand for value-added products, ranging from chicken sausages, nuggets and salami to chicken tikka masala.

 Leading the pack is Arambagh Hatcheries Limited, which is pumping in Rs 200 crore in a high-tech poultry processing plant at Sonamukhi in Bankura next year.

 Were in talks with Marubeni Corporation and other Japanese players. They will put in equity of around Rs 120 crore in the venture, said P.K. Roy, managing director, Arambagh. 

 One of Indias poultry majors, Arambagh exports 125 tonnes of chicken to Japans supermarkets, many of them run by Marubeni, every month.

 Roy reckons it is possible to generate a turnover of Rs 1,100 crore from this venture, if plans to export 1,000 tonnes of meat every month work out. The domestic market will account for over Rs 350 crore of the total turnover.

 Most of it will be ready-to-cook, marinated or ready-to-eat products?. Calcutta will have about 30 to 35 per cent share in the domestic market. Value-added products now account for 50 per cent of our total sales, which is an indicator of the rising importance of this sector, Roy said.

 According to Pradeep Bagla, MD, Amrit Feeds Ltd, by 2010, around 30 per cent of poultry products will be branded. 

 Were planning two processing plants ? one for north Bengal near Siliguri and another on the outskirts of Calcutta. Taking into account the branding, marketing and retail counters, well invest around Rs 100 crore, starting mid-2006. Products will range from dressed chicken to cut pieces and sausages, said Bagla, whose company produces dressed birds at its Howrah plant. 

 Chicken processing also figures in the expansion plans of Indonesian poultry feed major Japfa. Well invest around Rs 15 crore in a medium-sized poultry processing plant over the next two years. We have the technology, expertise and marketing skills and this is the happening sector, said a top official of the company from Pune. 

 According to trade watchers, Bengals poultry market is growing at a steady 20 per cent and value-added items at over 40 per cent.

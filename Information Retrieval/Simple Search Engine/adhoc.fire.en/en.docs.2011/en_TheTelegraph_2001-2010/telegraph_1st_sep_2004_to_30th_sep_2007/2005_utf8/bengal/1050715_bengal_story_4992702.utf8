 Siliguri, July 14: A day before talks with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, GNLF chief Subash Ghisingh stuck to his demand for the inclusion of Siliguri subdivision in the new hill council but appeared to have softened his stand on the Dooars region.

 Talking to reporters here today en route to Calcutta, Ghisingh reiterated that the subdivision of Siliguri had always been a part of Darjeeling district. I will take strong objection if Siliguri is not included in the DGHC (Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council), he said.

 Ghisingh conceded it was a mistake not to have sought Siliguris inclusion in the council in 1988 when the DGHC accord was signed. But, he added, it was still not too late to rectify the situation.

 Besides, he argued, for the sake of administrative convenience, it would be prudent to include Siliguri in the DGHC. There should not be multi-development (read administrative) agencies (in one district).

 Rejecting the CPMs claim that the geographical area of the council had already been decided when the pact was inked, Ghisingh said the tripartite agreement was not a binding document. In any case, there is a provision in the Sixth Schedule to include or exclude areas (under the autonomous district council).

 He, however, indicated that the Dooars would not be a hard bargaining point, saying he had sought its inclusion following persistent demand by the people of the area.

 Aituc loses office to Citu

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, March 1: The Left twins today fought each other over a party office here. 

 The trouble broke out when Citu members allegedly took over a room used by an affiliate of the Aituc, the CPI union, near Siliguri station.

 The ?rival? unions brought out rallies shouting slogans against each other and the CPI district leadership even lodged an FIR at the Siliguri police station against ?rowdies? who allegedly threw out fans and furniture before occupying the room around 10.30 am. 

 The party also alleged that CPM councillor Shanti Chakraborty was present during the incident.

 Tension was brewing since Swapan Saha, the treasurer of the Aituc-affiliated fruit and vegetable vendors? union, was pressured to show the accounts by his own party. Ujjal Chowdhury, the CPI district secretary, said Saha ?switched allegiance to the Citu almost overnight, claiming the support of a majority of members?. 

 He ?took over? the office today. Chakraborty said the Citu had the right to the room after the switchover.

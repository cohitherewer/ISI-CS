 Father finds lost girl as cops share banter 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Feb. 15: A father tired of doing the rounds of police stations where officers would not listen or simply laugh at him finally traced his 13-year-old daughter to Delhi, raped and ready to be driven into prostitution.

 Shahabuddin Mondal, a farmer at Kastodanga in Nadia?s Haringhata, 55 km from Calcutta, set out for Delhi with some of his neighbours. 

 When he found his daughter ? at the hideout of a ?wanted? Nadia criminal ? she was bruised all over. Raped and abused for days, her ultimate destination would have been a brothel, the girl said. 

 Shahabuddin brought her back yesterday. ?Insulted and humiliated? by the local officers, he has decided to plead for ?justice? with superintendent of police Benoy Chakraborty and deputy inspector-general Debendra Sukul. 

 Shahabuddin lodged a missing complaint when his daughter, a Class VI student, did not return home from school on February 2. 

 Two days later, a fellow villager tipped him off that some traders had seen his daughter being picked by a known criminal, Salem Mondal, and his associates. They also said Salem was suspected of being part of a girl-running racket with contacts in Delhi. 

 On February 5, Shahabuddin again visited the police station, lodged an FIR and narrated what he had come to know. But ?the police babu remained indifferent?. 

 He said: ?Some villagers saw Salem holding my daughter?s hand firmly and three others surrounding her. She was pushed into a car?? 

 The policemen, Shahabuddin said today, ?laughed at me? They even asked me to go to Delhi looking for my daughter?. When he told his neighbours what the police said, they rallied together and cracked the kidnap case.

 Additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh today ordered an inquiry into the conduct of the officer handling the case. ?I?ve sought details of the probe conducted after Shahabuddin lodged the FIR. Stern action will be taken against the officer, if found guilty,? he said. 

 Salem, according to the police, is ?absconding?. A fresh case has now been registered against him.

 Bill to open land lock

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 16: The government has cleared the decks for freeing land in closed or sick units in the state.

 The government will table a bill in the current session of Assembly to amend the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, 1953, which would lift the bar on sale of land allotted to industry post-Independence.

 By the amendment, the government will empower itself to allow sick or closed industries to change the character of land or sell it if the revival package is approved by financial institutions or banks and if dues of employees and creditors have been settled.

 The government will also be empowered to reclaim land from a sick or closed industry if it feels no initiative is being taken for its revival.

 The bill is expected to be cleared at the cabinet meeting next week before it is tabled in the Assembly. Once the land is freed, the district magistrate will fix a reserved price after which it will be auctioned. 

 In a recent report on investment climate in the state, UKs department for international development advised the government to unlock land tied up in sick/closed units and offer it to investors for new industrial or housing projects. Over 160 sq km was said to be in the possession of 500 sick/weak and closed units in 2004.

 Clean-up in tech school

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, April 29: After 85 students reported sick and over 2,000 fled hostel, the National Institute of Technology today woke up to the fact that its drinking water supply system had to be checked.

 In a bid to control damage after the suspected outbreak of jaundice on campus, the NIT announced a Rs 5-lakh project to upgrade the drinking water system in the college and hostel buildings.

 An official admitted that no major work for the upkeep of the system was undertaken over the past decade. ?About Rs 39 lakh was allotted every year for the institute?s maintenance but almost all of it was spent on repair of civil construction. The need to check the water supply was felt after the students took ill,? the official said. 

 The director of the deemed university, A.C. Ganguly, who returned from Delhi this morning, held a series of meetings with the dean of the development and planning department, Partha Pratim Sengupta, wardens and staff. The decision to overhaul the system was taken after the meeting. 

 Ganguly said he will look into why the system was not maintained properly.

 ?We will upgrade our drinking water system to prevent the spread of such diseases in future. Modern water purifiers will be installed and old pipelines replaced before the college reopens,? said Sengupta. 

 Yesterday, the institute deferred all examinations and suspended classes till July 1. Before leaving the premises, many students complained about unhygienic living conditions. 

 The authorities have also asked the local civic body and the Durgapur Steel Plant to conduct a survey of the institute?s water supply network.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Aug. 1: School education minister Kanti Biswas told the Assembly today that the government will not recognise any new madarsa in the state. 

 At present, there are 508 recognised madarsas in Bengal. Of them, 32 follow the HS syllabus. Biswas told reporters in his Assembly chamber that many madarsas now operate without government sanction. We will neither recognise these institutions nor close them down, the minister added. 

 Calcutta: Chayan Mukherjee, who retired as additional director-general, law and order, took charge on Monday as an officer on special duty, coordination, in the police directorate. He will monitor Maoist activities and liaison with the home ministry and the Centre. Raj Kanojia, a senior IPS officer, will be the new inspector-general, law and order.

 Barasat: Arjun Debnath, who returned from Mumbai with AIDS last month, was chained by neighbours at a North 24-Parganas village and locked up in a room on Monday. A member of the panchayat at Asharu village in Bagda, 60 km from Calcutta, said he was later shifted to the district hospital. Earlier, Debnath was allegedly denied admission to a local health centre.

 Ransom call: marriage

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Barasat, Feb. 6: In a real life rerun of a Bollywood flick, a gang of youths kidnapped a 13-year-girl from Barasat because one of them wants to marry her.

 While on her way to a local school, Supriya Roy was waylaid and taken to an unknown destination, police said.

 North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said: ?The youths stopped her and made her board a waiting car. Witnesses said they sped away before anybody could collect wits and give chase.? 

 After the incident, one of the kidnappers ? identified as a ?local youth? ? called the girl?s brother and asked the family to endorse the marriage as ?ransom? to get her back.

 Though a case was initially lodged with Barasat police station on Thursday, police swung into action only on Sunday ? after the hue and cry triggered by Roma Jhawar?s abduction from near her Salt Lake home.

 Roy?s abductors repeatedly called the girl?s brother on his mobile phone, asking the family not to contact the police. 

 The police, however, said the girl?s family has not received any ransom calls.

 A group-D employee of Baniniketan Vidyaniketan, where Supriya studies, told the police that she had spotted some youths in their early twenties near the school around 10.30 pm on Friday morning. A Barasat police station official said: ?They were waiting outside the school in a black car. As Supriya approached the school gate, the youths pounced on her and bundled her into the car and sped off. The employee could easily spot the girl as she was in her school uniform.? 

 Shefali Halder, an aunt in Barasat, brought up the girl and her brother. Their parents are in Bangladesh, where the father deals in foodgrain and other agricultural produce.

 The police, Halder alleged, initially tried to hush up the case and even asked her to withdraw the complaint. Pulak Basu, a local CPM leader, also told her that ?calling the police might complicate matters?.

 Behrampore, Nov. 30: A day after being granted bail, Arpita Chowdhury went to pay husband Adhir a visit at Behrampore central jail this morning.

 Meeting after nearly a fortnight, the couple spent 10 minutes together ? although Arpita was in the jail for about an hour ? and spoke about their only daughter Sreyashi, who is in Calcutta, and their pet dog Reshma. 

 Adhir, an MP from Behrampore, has been behind bars since November 20 in connection with the murders of a father and a son on the night of July 23 in Behrampore. Arpita, a co-accused in the case, was granted bail by Calcutta High Court yesterday.

 Adhir, who was produced in the chief judicial magistrates court on Monday and remanded in jail custody till December 8, has been asked to appear in additional district judge Narendra Rais court in Gorabazar, about 200 km from Calcutta, on Friday.

 Dressed in a printed sari and a red shawl, Arpita entered the prison premises around 11.25 am. Murshidabad zilla parishad sabhadhipati Siddika Begum accompanied her. 

 According to jail sources, Arpita asked her husband about his bail petition. Adhir told her not to worry as it was being looked after by senior Congress leaders, said an official.

 Arpita later met reporters at her house. I am grateful to CPM state secretary Anil Biswas who must have told the administration to sympathetically consider my case. He is like my father and has tried his best for my release though I happen to be the wife of a Congress MP, she said.

 Arpita said she would not join any movement to protest Adhirs arrest. I am simply a housewife. So, I prefer to distance myself from any sort of political movement.

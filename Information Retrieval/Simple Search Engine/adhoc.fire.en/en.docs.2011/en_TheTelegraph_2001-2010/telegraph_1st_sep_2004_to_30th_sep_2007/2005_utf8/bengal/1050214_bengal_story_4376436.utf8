 Rape count rings alarm

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Feb. 13: Two youths dragged a 16-year-old girl to the university premises at Kalyani and raped her last night in the fourth such incident involving a minor recorded in Nadia in less than a month. 

 The incident, barely a day after the rape and murder of 14-year-old schoolgirl Prabhati Roy at Krishnagar on Friday night, has sent shock waves through Nadia. 

 District magistrate Rajesh Pandey called an emergency meeting with administration and police authorities to discuss ways to counter the rising rape graph.

 To start with, Pandey has asked all 17 block development officers to ban video shows at night. He has also ordered raids on illegal video parlours that screen pornographic films. Much of the crowd at these shows comprises youngsters. 

 The police said the girl raped at Kalyani, 50 km from Calcutta, was a student of Class VI and lived with her uncle Teg Bahadur and aunt Jyotsna at Ghoshpara, adjacent to the university. 

 Last night, around 9, she stepped out of the house to buy biscuits when local anti-socials Bau Biswas and Bijoy Biswas zeroed in on her.

 ?Some residents saw Basu and Bijoy dragging her away and she shouting for help. But none dared to intervene,? said an officer of the Kalyani police station.

 An hour later, the girl returned home weeping.

 ?My niece was writhing in pain and crying. She narrated to me what she went through and said the two toughs threatened her with dire consequences if she dared to speak out..,? said Jyotsna.

 Teg Bahadur and Jyotsna admitted her to Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital and lodged a complaint with the police. 

 District superintendent of police Benoy Chakraborty said: ?Basu and Bijoy have been arrested from a hideout on the outskirts of Kalyani.? 

 Pandey has also asked the police station officers-in-charge to keep an eye on the screening of movies with ?too much of sex and violence?. 

 He said: ?We have reports that a large number of children and teenagers attend video shows at night. We want to launch an awareness campaign among parents and guardians in this regard. I have also planned to engage NGOs to chalk out the campaign.?

 The parents ? both of girls and boys ? are concerned. Bankim Ghosh, a father of two sons aged 14 and 16, said they go to see Hindi films, ?which are bad?.

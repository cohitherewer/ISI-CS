 IT union

 Calcutta, Dec. 19: Nirupam Sen today said workers in the IT sector had every right to form unions but it was also their duty to protect the industrys interests. 

 The industries minister almost echoed Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in saying: It finally depends on them (the employees), whether they want to form an association. It cannot be imposed. 

 Told that in some IT firms, employees work for 10 to 12 hours, Sen said: No one has complained. But if they set up an association, they can raise this issue also.

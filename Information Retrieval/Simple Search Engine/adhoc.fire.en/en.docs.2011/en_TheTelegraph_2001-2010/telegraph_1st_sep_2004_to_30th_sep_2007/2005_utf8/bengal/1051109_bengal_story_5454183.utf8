 Truck hub with touch of hi-tech

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Nov. 8: A memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the states first logistic hub will be signed between the government and a consortium on Thursday. 

 Delhi-based Unitech group, in which NRI businessman Prasun Mukherjee holds a stake, Singapore-based Jorange International and some other companies have formed the consortium, which bagged the contract for the project along Kona Expressway. 

 The consortium will pay Rs 103 crore to the government for 108 acres owned by the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority.

 Work will start immediately after the signing of the agreement, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said today. The project is scheduled for completion in about two years. 

 In addition to a truck terminal, the hub will have hotels, motels, offices for logistic operators, service apartments, specialised warehouses, cold-storage facilities, specialised mechanism for loading and unloading containers, food courts with dhabas and multi-cuisine restaurants and entertainment centres. The storehouses will be equipped with separate facilities for machinery, food products, chemicals and other goods.

 We are planning to have enough infrastructure in place so that the area can be developed into a dry port for exports to countries like China later on. This will be facilitated further if Kona Expressway can be accorded National Highway status, Bhattacharya said. 

 The logistic hub is one of the several major public-private-partnership projects being implemented by the CMDA. 

 The hub will be split into two blocks on either side of the expressway. One will be spread on 73 acres and the other 35. 

 The consortium won the contract after a two-phase bidding. In the first, the bidders submitted a concept plan. Then a detailed plan that included the time-frame for execution, a CMDA official said.

 Sources said one of Calcuttas leading developers, South City, ended second in the race.

 Bhattacharya said the consortium was selected because its bid was the highest. Although four companies had submitted expressions of interest, the consortium offered Rs 108 crore while the second bidder offered only Rs 45 crore. Our choice was clear.

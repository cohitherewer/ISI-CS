 Highrises in flight path

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR AND SANJAY MANDAL

 Calcutta, May 28: Not dense fog or a cracked windscreen, pilots flying to and from Calcutta airport have a new headache.

 The towering buildings in the Rajarhat New Town area are threatening to get in their way. In the past few months, the Rajarhat municipality has received over 150 new applications for highrises and many, authorities say, come within the 25-nautical-mile restricted zone.

 The Airlines Operators Committee (AOC) and the airports air safety wing have voiced concerns over the construction boom in New Town. At times, due to very poor visibility, the pilots have to fly at extremely low altitudes and there is a big chance for accidents, an AOC spokesperson said.

 M.K. Singh, the regional secretary of the Indian Commercial Pilots Association, said in the near future flying to Calcutta could pose a danger. 

 If constructions come up unabated near the touchdown and take-off zones, it will become a major worry as in Mumbai airport where one of the runways has become non-operational after the construction of a tower, he said from Mumbai.

 Taking a cue from this, the Airports Authority of India has imposed strict restrictions on giving clearance to builders. 

 Unscrupulous promoters not taking permission will face strong action, including demolition, Moloy Dutta, the deputy general manager (highrise) of Calcutta airport, said. The no-objection certificate is given by the AAI free of cost and so we appeal to everyone to apply. 

 Dutta said his department receives 20 applications on an average for no-objection certificates in a month. 

 Clearance certificates are given to buildings that fall within the restricted area and are up to 15 metres high. For higher buildings, we give permission only after the authorities abide by the rules and bring down the proposed height, Dutta said.

 Some are, however, taken for a ride by builders who quote extremely high prices for apartments without the requisite civil aviation clearance.

 Samiran Das is one such victim. He had booked a 1,500-sq-ft flat at Rajarhat New Town. The flat, in a proposed 21-storeyed building, cost around Rs 20 lakh and Das had approached HSBC for a loan. The bank turned him down, saying the building did not have Calcutta airports clearance certificate.

 The local administration has pledged not to allow buildings above the stipulated height.

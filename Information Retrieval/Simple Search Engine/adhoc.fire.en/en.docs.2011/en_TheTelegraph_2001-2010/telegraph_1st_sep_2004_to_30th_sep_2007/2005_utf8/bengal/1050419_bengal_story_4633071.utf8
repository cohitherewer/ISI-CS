 A tribe called Brahmin

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Darjeeling, April 18: Subash Ghisingh has officially demanded that all Gorkha communities, including Brahmins, be declared Schedule Tribes.

 In a letter to Kunwar Singh, the chairman of the National Commission of Scheduled Tribes, days before he left for Delhi to attend a tripartite meeting to end the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council impasse, Ghisingh demanded ST status for ?other Gorkha tribes?.

 He wrote on April 9 selective granting of the status to some tribes had ?created confusion, controversy, and ill feeling? among the hill people.

 The Government of India had through a notification on January 8, 2003, granted ST status to the Tamangs and Limboos, which led to demands from other hill communities, for the same status. The Lepchas and the Bhutias were earlier granted the ST status.

 Ghisingh has, however, gone a step ahead and demanded that all other communities be declared Scheduled Tribes in India. These communities, along with the Tamangs and Limboos, will constitute about 90 per cent of the hill population.

 The GNLF leader pressed for his claim saying all the Gorkha tribes shared their culture and religious beliefs and were counted among ?bonbo? worshippers (people who consider stones, rivers and trees their deity).

 Sources said during his recent week-long stay in Delhi, Ghisingh raised the demand with the departments concerned. Over the past few years, the DGHC has been holding the annual Bonbo National Tourist Festival in the hills.

 Observers said the demand has the possibility of putting all other issues raised by his rivals in the backburner and could also sway mass support in the coming days.

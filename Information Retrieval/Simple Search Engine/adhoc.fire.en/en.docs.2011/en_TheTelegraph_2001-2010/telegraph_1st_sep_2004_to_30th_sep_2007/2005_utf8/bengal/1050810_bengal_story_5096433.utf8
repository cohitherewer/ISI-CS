 Japan role in waste project

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 9: The Japan Bank for International Co-operation (JBIC) will help fund a pilot project for solid waste management in six municipalities of Hooghly district.

 A team of bank representatives led by country director M. Hataeda today met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings and assured him of funds for the pilot project. 

 The team also met finance minister Asim Dasgupta and urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya. The amount required for the project is being worked out.

 We are taking loans from JBIC for a solid waste management project and we will also share expertise with them, the chief minister said. 

 The Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority will implement the project.

 Officials said the bank will also help provide technical knowhow. If the pilot project turns out to be successful, other solid waste management projects in the state will follow and JBIC will be approached for funds, one of them said.

 While Dasgupta said the bank had principally agreed to provide loan for the projects, Bhattacharya said todays discussion was positive.

 Initially it (the project) will be executed outside the city and if it succeeds, will be extended to other parts of the state, the urban development minister said.

 After meeting the chief minister, Hataeda said they had a long relationship with Bengal. It is the largest recipient of loans sanctioned by us. Moreover, we have also made long-term financial assistance to various projects in the country, he said.

 Hataeda said they have offered help in different fields, which include the power sector, Metro Railway in Calcutta, and flyovers.

 He also appreciated the governments efforts to preserve the environment.

 Bengal is playing an active role in protection of environment and in this regard, they have taken a number of positive steps, said Hataeda.

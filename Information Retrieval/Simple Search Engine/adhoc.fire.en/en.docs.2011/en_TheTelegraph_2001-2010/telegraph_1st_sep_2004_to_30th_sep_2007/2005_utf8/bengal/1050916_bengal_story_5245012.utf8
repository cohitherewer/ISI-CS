 Cops shuffled

 Calcutta, Sept. 15: Officers-in-charge of eight police stations in Asansol have been transferred in accordance with a directive from the Election Commission, reports our staff reporter.

 A byelection to the Asansol parliamentary constituency will be held on September 28. The bypoll follows the death of CPM MP Bikash Chowdhury.

 State chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee said eight OCs were transferred as they had served in police stations more than four years.

 Banerjee, who will undertake a visit to Asansol sometime next week to oversee the poll preparations, said two armed policemen will be deployed in each of 1136 booths in the Asansol Parliamentary constituency on the polling day. Besides, 15 companies of the central para-military forces will be stationed in Asansol to assist the state police.

 Meanwhile, the CPM, which has nominated state cottage and small scale industries minister Bansogopal Chowdhury as a party candidate, has already geared up the poll campaign. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will address an election rally in Asansol town on September 21.

 On its part, Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress, which has put up party MLA Malay Ghatak as party nominee for the seat, is yet to launch its electioneering process. Trinamul sources, however, said Mamata will arrive in Asansol with 10 party MLAs on September 23 and will camp in Asansol till the elections are over.

 The beleaguered state Congress has so far not lined up any election meetings in Asansol due to unavailability of such senior leaders as defence minister and PCC chief Pranab Mukherjee and former PCC president Somen Mitra.

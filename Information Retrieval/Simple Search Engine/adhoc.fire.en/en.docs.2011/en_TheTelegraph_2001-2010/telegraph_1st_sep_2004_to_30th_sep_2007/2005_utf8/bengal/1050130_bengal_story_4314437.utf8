 Kid suicide over Rs 2 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Jan. 29: Nine-year-old Sanjib Das today committed suicide after a tiff with his mother over Rs 2 for tiffin. 

 Sanjib, a Class III student of Rajbagan Para Primary School in Ranaghat, threw tantrums this morning when Sulata said she could not give the Rs 2 she had promised last night because she forgot to ask for it from his father, a taxi driver, before he left for work. 

 As Sulata left to drop Sanjib?s brother in school, the boy took a sari, went into a hut the family used as a storeroom and hung himself from the bamboo roof, said additional police superintendent Biswarup Ghosh.

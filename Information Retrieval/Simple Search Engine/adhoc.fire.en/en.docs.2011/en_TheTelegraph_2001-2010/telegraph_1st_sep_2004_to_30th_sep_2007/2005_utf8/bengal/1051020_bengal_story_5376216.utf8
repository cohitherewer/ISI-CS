 Adda to vent silent anger

 Burdwan, Oct. 19: They are deaf and dumb, and jobless.

 Shib Shankar Dasgupta, Sujan Hazra and Anwarul Hossain have hit upon a unique way to vent their frustration ? adda through sign language. And it has not been merely idle talk. The sessions have attracted, apart from curious glances from passers-by, the attention of the district administration.

 The three, along with 20 others who share their predicament, have formed a Coffee House of their own on the steps of a house.

 We may be deaf and mute, but we want to contribute to our families and to the society. Most of us have some basic education and many of us have passed Madhyamik from a school meant for deaf and mute students. We have tried our best to get jobs, but in vain. So, we hold these adda sessions. We thought this was the best possible way to vent our feelings, enjoy ourselves and temporarily escape from lifes drudgery, Anwarul scribbled on a piece of paper.

 Respite came for the youths, but briefly. The organisers of the local Parapukur Durga Puja Committee had helped them open a tea stall for a week during the pujas.

 We managed to make a net profit of about Rs 1,000 from the tea stall. We are still arranging tea and snacks in our adda from the profit we made, Sujan wrote, a smile lighting up his face at the memory of the booty. But we dont know how long we can carry on like this, he added.

 Burdwan district magistrate Subrata Gupta said the authorities are sympathetic. It is good that they have found a way to come out of their frustration. I understand it is very difficult for them to get jobs. But I can help them if they want to create self-help groups and start something like a small business.

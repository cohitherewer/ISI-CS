 Singh amp; Singh helpline

 ASHIS CHAKRABARTI

 Singapore, Aug. 22: Buddhdadeb Bhattacharjee is effusive about the help he has received from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and other Union ministers and officials, particularly Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, in his search for investments from Indonesia and Singapore.

 The chief minister, in Singapore today on way to Jakarta for talks with the Salim Group that is proposing large investments in Bengal, mentioned how Singh had been prompt to clear a highway project connecting north to south Bengal, thereby addressing the states connectivity problem.

 He (the Prime Minister) called all officers concerned and not only sorted out problems but also arranged for central funds for the project.

 Singh, he recalled, was just as gracious in intervening in the dispute over the use of iron ore from Jharkhand by the Jindal group for its proposed steel plant in Bengal. 

 Soon Ill have a meeting with Arjun Munda (Jharkhand chief minister) on the issue. If he cant make it, his chief secretary will meet our officials, he said.

 Jharkhand is refusing to allow any steel project to use iron ore mines in its territory unless the plant is also set up in the state.

 Bhattacharjee reciprocated not just the good the Prime Minister had done him ? and Bengal? but also the good words Singh had for Bengals Marxist-turned-reformist chief minister.

 So, was the Prime Minister doing more for him than his party leaders in Delhi were doing for Singh and the UPA government? Don get into all this, he replied, obviously not wanting to spoil the positive mood in which he has started the trip.

 But his generous praise of the Prime Minister clearly stands apart from the off-and-on equations the CPM leaders in Delhi have with Singh and his government. The message clearly from Bhattacharjee was that he would go all out to be friends with the government in Delhi for the sake of the new turn in Bengals economy.

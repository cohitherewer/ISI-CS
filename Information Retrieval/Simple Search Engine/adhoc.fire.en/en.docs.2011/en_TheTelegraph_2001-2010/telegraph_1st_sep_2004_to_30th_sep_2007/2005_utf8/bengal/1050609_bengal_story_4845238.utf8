 Lease of life for paper mill

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 8: Under lock and key for over six years, Bengal Paper Mill at Ranigunj in Burdwan district will open its doors again, but in a new avatar.

 The Emta group of companies, which acquired the unit following a long litigation, has decided to invest Rs 1,600 crore and turn it into a sprawling industrial complex.

 The company has planned an industrial complex at Ranigunj, housing an integrated steel plant and a 300-mw thermal power plant in addition to a speciality paper packaging unit. Over 1,600 people will get jobs after all three projects start rolling, small-scale and cottage industries minister Bangshagopal Chowdhury said at Writers Buildings this afternoon.

 According to Emta officials, the power plant will be a Rs 1,000-crore investment, while Rs 500 crore will be poured into the steel plant. The paper packaging unit will require an investment of Rs 65 crore.

 There is some vested land behind the premises. The investors will also try to acquire some private land nearby to expand their operations, Chowdhury said. 

 The paper mill stands on a 250-acre plot.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had long wanted the paper mill to reopen, Chowdhury said. Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen has overseen the reopening of the mill and has participated in meetings at different levels, he added.

 Labourers from Ranigunj and Mejia in Bankura will get work once construction of the complex starts, the minister said.

 Around 600 people had lost their jobs when the paper mill closed down in April 1999. 

 While the paper packaging unit is scheduled to take off by 2007, the steel plant will begin operations in 2007-2008 and the power plant by 2009.

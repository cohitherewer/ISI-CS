 Vehicles out of control kill two 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 15: After a brief Puja lull, separate road accidents claimed two lives this morning. 

 Around 5 am on St Georges Gate Road, under South Port police station, a speeding lorry lost control and hit an unidentified elderly man while he was on a morning stroll near the second Hooghly Bridge. 

 After hitting the pedestrian, the lorry crashed against a roadside fence. Police suspect the driver was dozing at the wheel. 

 The elderly man suffered critical head injuries and lay bleeding at the spot for sometime. The lorry driver fled the spot leaving the vehicle. Later, a patrolling policeman rushed him to SSKM Hospital, where he was declared brought dead. 

 Residents said the man was walking on one side of the road and had no inkling that a vehicle coming from behind would knock him down. He had bled for considerable time on the road and some locals who found him lying there while on a morning walk informed us about the accident, said a senior police official of South Port police station. 

 Exactly two hours after the St Georges gate accident, a resident crossing the road at Rabindra Sarani near the Natun Bazaar area was hit by a private bus. The vehicle for route number 215-A had apparently lost control. 

 Shibdani Yadav, 60, was rushed to the Marwari Relief Society Hospital and then taken to RG Kar Medical College Hospital where he was declared brought dead. 

 This cannot go on here, we must put a stop to this, protested residents, who damaged the bus and pelted stones at passing vehicles. They also put up a road blockade and the police had to intervene to calm them down. 

 There is no one to check the vehicles early morning. A vast stretch of Rabindra Sarani turns into a death trap and we want some policemen posted at the intersections to deal with the crisis, said Narayan Ram, one of the residents. 

 In this case, too, the driver escaped. The bus was seized and taken to Jorabagan police station. A police picket was posted in the area.

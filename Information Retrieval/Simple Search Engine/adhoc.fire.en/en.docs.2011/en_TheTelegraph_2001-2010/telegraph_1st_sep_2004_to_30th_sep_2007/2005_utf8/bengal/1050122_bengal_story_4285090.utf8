 Governor Gopal Gandhi today visited Rabindranath Tagore?s 

 abode of peace and turned emotional recounting the meeting 

 between his grandfather, Mahatma Gandhi, and Gurudev on 

 March 16, 1915.

 Now the Rector of Visva-Bharati, Gopal Gandhi touched the floor of Shyamali, Tagore?s mud house in Uttarayan where the Mahatma had spent a few days. 

 ?Bhasha key aagey bhavnaye chal rahi hai? yahan do atmao ka milan hua hai (My feelings are racing ahead of my expressions. This is the place where two great souls met),? the governor said. 

 ?After that meeting, Tagore called Gandhi a Mahatma and he reciprocated by calling Tagore Gurudev,? said Goutam Bhattacharya, a Patha Bhavan teacher.

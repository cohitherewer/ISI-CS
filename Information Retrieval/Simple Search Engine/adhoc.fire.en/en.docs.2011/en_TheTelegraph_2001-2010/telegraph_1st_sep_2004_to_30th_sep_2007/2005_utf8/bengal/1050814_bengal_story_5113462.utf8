 Cops put malls on I-Day alert

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 13: The citys shopping malls have been put on high alert following intelligence inputs about suspected militants crossing over from Bangladesh on the eve of Independence Day.

 At a meeting today with representatives of shops and security agencies, the police top brass outlined a series of measures to avert any untoward incident at these high-density zones.

 Mall-owners have been asked to be particularly careful about cars being parked on the premises and have been directed to clear out dustbins at regular intervals. 

 Besides beefing up police presence at these malls, which are expected to draw huge crowds during the extended weekend and especially on August 15, the agencies in charge of security on the premises have been asked to keep a check on unattended bags and people moving aimlessly.

 The mall-owners were briefed about steps to be taken for the safety of all. It wont be proper to discuss these measures with everybody. We are not taking chances, said N. Ramesh Babu, the acting deputy commissioner of police (headquarters).

 The two-hour meeting held at the Lalbazar headquarters discussed every mall in detail, including the number of entry and exit points, the total security guard deployment per shift and the expected crowd in the next two days.

 Since ours is a huge complex, there would be no problem of overcrowding. However, as the parking is at the basement, well be particularly careful about cars entering the complex, said Raj Kumar Fenn, the senior manager of CB Richard Ellis South Asia Private Limited, the company in charge of maintenance and security of 22 Camac Street. Besides Pantaloons and Westside, the address houses 25 offices in four blocks, two restaurants and two jewellery shops along with gift and music shops. 

 Among several warnings this year, the intelligence agencies have particularly cautioned the police about a team of 27 militants from Bangladesh led by Azizur Rehaman alias Bangla Bhai, who is believed to be planning car bomb attacks. Rehaman along with other suspected members of the Jamat-ul Mujahideen are tipped to enter the city via Malda to create unrest on Independence Day-eve.

 Authorities at Metro Plaza on Ho Chi Minh Sarani have decided not to allow cars with drivers waiting inside to park on their premises. All vehicles would be thoroughly scanned by the private security agency working in tandem with a force to be deployed from the local Shakespaeare Sarani police station.

 Even the citys central business district, including parts of Burrabazar and Posta, have been brought under the security blanket. The police presence at Metro Railway stations, too, would be intensified, said Ajay Kumar, DC, (central).

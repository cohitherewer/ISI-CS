 New tax rate for Salt Lake residents

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Calcutta, Sept. 18: Pay up for the services ? that is the message the government appears to be sending out to the residents of Salt Lake. 

 The CPM-controlled Bidhannagar municipality has decided to revise property tax rates from November, apparently in response to the party brass and the governments emphasis on self-reliance. 

 Our leadership has asked the municipality to draw lessons from the initiatives of agencies like the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to generate revenue for themselves. It has been told to increase income to be able to maintain infrastructure and provide services to residents, said a senior CPM leader of North 24-Parganas, under which falls the states showpiece township. 

 Party officials said the decision to implement the revised rates was taken before the civic polls. Although a case is pending in the Supreme Court, officials said there was no legal hurdle as the court had not stayed the order.

 The new rate of taxes could not be imposed earlier because of the polls. The new board had also sought time, but it was asked to take an immediate decision as further delay would have meant another round of elections, a source said.

 Biswajiban Majumdar, the new chairman of the municipality, said: The new rates would be applicable from November. I do not know why they were not imposed earlier.

 We are working out the tax modules for the new rates and they will be finalised in about a week. Only then it would become clear how much a resident will have to pay. If we have to provide the services, we must earn the money for that, said an official. 

 Party leaders pointed out the biggest problem for the civic body ? the expenditure-earning disparity. 

 Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) and the urban development department had been providing assistance for the upkeep of infrastructure. 

 But the municipality has been told that this will gradually stop and it must increase earnings to become self-sufficient, a CPM leader said.

 Amitabha Nandi, the MP from Dum Dum, echoed him: The people must pay for the services, he said.

 With the government deciding to put Sector V under a separate body, a good part of the municipalitys earnings will also go. Expenses will increase further with plans afoot to repair roads, renovate parks and provide more street lights, official sources said.

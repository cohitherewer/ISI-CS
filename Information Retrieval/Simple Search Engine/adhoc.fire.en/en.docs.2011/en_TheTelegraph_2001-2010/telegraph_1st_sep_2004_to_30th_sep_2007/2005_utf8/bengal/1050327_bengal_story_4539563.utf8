 Foreign focus on city fliers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 26: With Calcuttans emerging as the new high fliers, foreign airlines in expansion mode have the city on top of their mind.

 Inspired by the Singapore Airlines success story ? the maximum number of bookings on the Singapore-New York flight was from the Calcutta sector ? Thai Airways is starting its non-stop flight from Bangkok to the Big Apple from May with special benefits for Calcuttans. 

 ?Any Calcuttan planning to take the Bangkok-New York flight will get special facilities like free hotel stay and transfer, along with lunch and breakfast, in Bangkok before taking the flight to New York,? said Krisnapong Srisinwarakool, general manager, Calcutta, Thai Airways.

 Thai is planning to start flights from Bangkok to Johannesburg and Moscow as well. 

 ?We are now working on the modalities of the project so that Calcuttans travelling to these destinations via Bangkok can get priority in terms of bookings, hospitality and also save time,? said Thai Airways district sales manager S.C. Kapur.

 There is more good news as far as the pocket is concerned. From April 1 to 30, the airline is offering a special package ? approximately Rs 13,500 for a two-way ticket to any Southeast Asian destination via Bangkok. A ticket to Bangalore and back costs around Rs 24,000.

 ?The offers are unbelievable, and during the month of May and June there will be more promotional offers for couples travelling by Thai Airways,? Srisinwarakool said.

 GMG Airline, which is planning to connect Dhaka with Dubai and Southeast Asian destinations, also has the city in the picture.

 The Travel Agents? Federation of India held a meeting with GMG officials in the city. The Bangladesh-based airline is keen to start more flights to Dhaka and other places. 

 ?We told them that Dubai is one viable option that can be seriously taken into consideration and they have taken our views,? said the federation?s eastern region chairman, Anil Punjabi.

 Ismail Choudhury, GMG?s sales and marketing director, told the federation representatives that the airline would soon start three daily flights to Dhaka and one daily flight to Chittagong, instead of three in a week. 

 ?The city has a big market share in international flights and we want to tap it further,? he said.

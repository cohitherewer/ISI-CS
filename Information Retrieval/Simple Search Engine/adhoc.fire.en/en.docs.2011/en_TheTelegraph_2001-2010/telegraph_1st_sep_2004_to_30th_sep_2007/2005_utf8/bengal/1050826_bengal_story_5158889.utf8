 Mother arrested after girl crusade

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Aug. 25: The mother of nine-year-old Bilkis Khatun was arrested this morning for allegedly forcing her into a marriage mid-July after the girl hitch-hiked to a police station and lodged her own complaint.

 Police are looking for the groom, Tufan Sheikh, the girls 25-year-old cousin, and qazi Aish Mohammad, who registered the marriage in Bhagabangola, 235 km from Calcutta. 

 Bilkis, a Class IV student of Natun Habaspur Primary School, was married off to Tufan in the absence of her father, the police said. Nurul Islam, a mason, works in Lucknow. 

 After her marriage on July 14, Bilkis was not sent off to her in-laws because of her tender age, a police officer said. After about two weeks, Tufan left for Lucknow, where he worked as a mason, while Bilkis stayed with her mother and went to school.

 This morning, Bilkis told her mother that she had to leave for school early as she had to meet a teacher. Moyna Bibi agreed. She walked up to the main road and caught a trekker to Bhagabangola, 5 km away. The little girl simply strode into the police station and narrated her plight to the officer on duty, a policeman said.

 The officer heard her out and asked Bilkis to lodge a written complaint, which she did with the help of a local youth present at the police station then. Treating the complaint as an FIR, the force got going. Along with Moyna Bibi, qazi Moazzem Hossain, who conducted the wedding, was held. 

 The girl had earlier tried to run away from the marriage, but her mother threatened her into submission. Moyna had even said that she would commit suicide if fled. 

 Tufan Sheikhs family is better off financially and we think the mother did not want to waste time when the youth readily agreed to the match, a police officer said.

 Murshidabad superintendent of police N.K. Singh confirmed that the arrests were made on the basis of Bilkiss complaint. The marriage of a minor girl is illegal, he said.

 CM calls PM into hill row 

 OUR BUREAU 

 Calcutta, Feb. 23: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow to discuss the stand-off over elections to the autonomous Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council. 

 The meeting follows Bhattacharjee?s request to Singh on phone during the day to intervene. Bhattacharjee stonewalled questions about the meeting. 

 Earlier, a meeting between Bhattacharjee, council chief Subash Ghisingh and home minister Shivraj Patil had failed to break the deadlock. 

 The state government has decided to appoint an administrator as polls to the hill council cannot be held by March 25, when its term expires. 

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya today said the DGHC Act would be amended to provide for an administrator. The chief minister would decide on the administrator, he added. 

 Interestingly, Ghisingh, who has been opposing elections and demanding devolution of powers, is scheduled to visit Berlin between March 3 and 18. He will attend the International Tourism Fair to promote Darjeeling and ?visit a few other places?. 

 The timing has raised eyebrows, considering that the programme had been planned long ago despite the March 25 deadline for elections.

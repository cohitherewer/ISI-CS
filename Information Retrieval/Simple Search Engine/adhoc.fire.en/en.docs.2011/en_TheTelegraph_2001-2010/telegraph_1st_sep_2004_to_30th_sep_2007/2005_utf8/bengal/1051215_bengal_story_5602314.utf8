 Terror shadow tells on tourist flow

 NARESH JANA

 Midnapore, Dec. 14: The migratory birds are making their annual trip, but thanks to the terror shadow looming large over West Midnapore district, the tourists are staying away.

 About 2,000 families in the picturesque Belpahari in Jhargram subdivision, whose livelihood depends on tourism, are struggling to make ends meet with the visitor inflow dropping sharply since last winter.

 Around 2,500 people from across the state and neighbouring Jharkhand had visited the forests and hills of Kankrajhore, Amjharna, Odalchua, Gadrasini, Laljal and Belpahari between October and March ? the peak tourist season ? in 2002-2003. 

 The number dipped to a dismal 302 last year and, this winter, not a single tourist has visited the belt so far. 

 District officials today said the tourist inflow has dried up since February last year when Maoist guerrillas planted landmines and killed eight security personnel at Nundhola on the way to Kankrajhore. The rebels struck again that December, blowing up parts of three forest bungalows in Kankrajhore.

 The district authorities and police are taking steps to woo back tourists. Armed escorts would be provided to tourists travelling to Belpahari, said superintendent of police Ajay Kumar Nand. 

 District magistrate D. Nariala said schemes to construct more roads are on track.

 However, these have done little to assure people who have set up business here. 

 I used to receive tourists from October to February every year. At least, 10 people used to stay in my lodge. I also had a restaurant and would earn a net profit of about Rs 500 daily. But ever since the Maoist problem intensified, tourists have stopped coming, said Gopinath Mahato, from Kankrajhore who turned his hut into a guesthouse five years ago. 

 Banamali Mura, another guesthouse owner, is facing the same predicament. I have not earned a single paise since December last year, he rued.

 The Maoist menace has spelt doom for local youths who had set up tea stalls and grocery stores. Many local travel agencies that used to rent out cars to tourists have also been thrown out of business. 

 Deben Singh from Amlashol ? where six persons alleged died of starvation last year ? used to sell tea on the way to Mayurjharna hills. I used to get about 200 tourists every day. Now, I am planning to close my shop and return to Amlashol, he said.

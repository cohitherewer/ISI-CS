 Gunshot death in Fort William

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Nov. 5: A naik in the armys Signal Regiment allegedly shot himself through his throat, shattering the early morning silence outside Fort William today. 

 Bhanja Dinakar Duttaroy, 38, was walking back from duty at the south gate of Fort William when he is believed to have pulled the trigger of his Insas rifle, firing two rounds before slumping into a pool of blood. 

 The rifle fell from his hand and so did the cache of bullets he was carrying to return to the armoury ? as is the practice. 

 It happened about 10 minutes after his duty was over at 6 in the morning. So far as we have gathered, Duttaroy was on duty from 4 am for two hours at the south gate. We are waiting for the post-mortem report before concluding anything on the cause of his death, said A.K. Chaudhury, the officer-in-charge of Maidan police station. 

 Rattled by the sound of firing, the entire security ring inside Fort William went into a tizzy, flashing alarm signals. Within minutes, senior officers rushed to the spot only to see Duttaroys body lying on the road and writhing in pain.

 An ambulance was immediately called for and members of the Signal Regiment helped their colleague get into the vehicle, which took him to Command Hospital in Alipore. 

 But Duttaroy died even before doctors could put him on any life-saving gadget. 

 Amid murmurs of Duttaroy suffering from depression because of continuous work pressure, senior army officers today said they had no clue why the naik, who hailed from Kolapur, took his life. 

 He returned from leave only recently and seemed perfectly normal in his behaviour. He would even visit the temple twice a day. The question of not getting leave doesnt apply to him, said an officer. 

 Psychiatrists in the city described Duttaroys behaviour as reactive depression that comes in spurts. It fades out for a few months when the victim manages to get a control over his emotions. But when it hits a person, he feels it is not worth living anymore.

 This is more so with people in the forces who live away from their families for long periods and tend to suffer after joining duty, feeling somewhat lost in the drudgery of routine existence, said psychiatrist Ranadip Ghosh Roy. 

 This is the first such incident that Fort William has witnessed. On April 25, an officer had pulled the trigger on himself at the army camp in Sahapur under New Alipore police station.

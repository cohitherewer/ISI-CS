 Housewife hacks husband

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chinsurah, March 30: A 40-year-old housewife murdered her husband last night in an apparent bid for freedom from mental and physical torture. 

 Manoara Bibi, with the help of her mother, hacked 45-year-old Sheikh Jamaluddin to pieces with a knife at Sitapur village in the Jangipara area of Hooghly district, 20 km from Calcutta. 

 Bharatlal Mina, the subdivisional police officer of Serampore, said both Manoara and her mother Manjula have been arrested and will be produced in the Serampore subdivisional judicial magistrate?s court tomorrow.

 According to police, Jamaluddin, a mason, would often beat up Manoara, the mother of his two children, and demand money from her family.

 Last night, the mother and daughter slit his throat, cut the body into pieces and stacked them in a corner of the room, the police added.

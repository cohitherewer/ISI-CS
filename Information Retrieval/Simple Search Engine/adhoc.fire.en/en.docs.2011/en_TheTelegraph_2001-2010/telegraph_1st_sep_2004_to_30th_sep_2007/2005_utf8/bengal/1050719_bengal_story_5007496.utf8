 Glare on take-more, pay-less schools 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 18: The government today said it would soon evolve a mechanism to keep a check on tuition fees charged by private English-medium schools and salaries they offered to teachers and other employees.

 We will begin working on the mechanism once we receive a report from the committee set up some time ago to study the fee structure and teachers pay-scales, school education minister Kanti Biswas said in the Assembly.

 The report will take another six months to reach us. We will have to do something about the high fees students have to pay and the low salaries the teaching and non-teaching staff get. 

 Guardians of students had complained to the government that the schools often hiked fees without proper justification. The government had also received complaints from teachers of private English-medium schools, who said they were paid less despite the rule that they should be paid on a par with their counterparts in state-aided institutions.

 The allegations from the guardians and teachers prompted the government to set up the committee, the minister said. Its members include senior officials of the education department, representatives of the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations, the Central Board of Secondary Education, guardians of private school students, heads of Anglo-Indian schools and teachers. 

 Biswas said his department lacked the infrastructure to keep tabs on the Delhi-board schools. But the government will definitely find out some measure to ensure that they follow a rational policy for increasing tuition fees and also fixing pay-scales of teachers and non-teaching employees.

 Now, the government has control over an unaided English medium school till it obtains its no-objection certificate and gets an affiliation to the Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations (for ICSE and ISC) or the Central Board of Secondary Education (for CBSE). 

 The minister said the schools often promise pay on a par with government institutions before getting its no-objection. Once they get the affiliation, the government has no control over them.

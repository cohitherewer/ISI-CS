 CPM frowns on fund drives

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 Calcutta, March 19: The CPM state leadership has issued a circular to its zonal and local committees across Bengal asking them not to collect funds without giving coupons to donors.

 The circular follows complaints to the leadership from members of the public and some party units about unauthorised collection of funds in the name of the organisation.

 ?We have noticed that in many cases, funds are being collected without giving any coupons to members of the public. Besides, some of our influential leaders collect funds in their own way, particularly during election time, and spend the amount for their campaign. They don?t bother to consult the district committees to which they are attached. They also don?t keep in mind party guidelines, which say collecting funds on their own and spending it for election campaign is immoral,? the CPM state leadership said in the circular distributed among the party units.

 The circular also questions the manner in which funds remain unaccounted for. ?Some of our leaders are not maintaining accounts for collection of funds through bills and coupons. They are also not refunding unused bills or coupons to the party units, keeping them in the dark about how much money was collected. Such a practice must be treated as crime and we have to initiate action against the leaders.? The units concerned are not taking action against errant leaders, it added.

 The party has cautioned members and leaders against illegally accumulating wealth and property. It has expressed its helplessness over some influential party leaders, MPs and MLAs organising fairs and festivals and forming non-government organisations. ?Such practices encourage dishonest party workers to come close to each other to serve their own interest. This tarnishes our party?s image but no measure has been taken by the state committee to control the menace,? the circular said.

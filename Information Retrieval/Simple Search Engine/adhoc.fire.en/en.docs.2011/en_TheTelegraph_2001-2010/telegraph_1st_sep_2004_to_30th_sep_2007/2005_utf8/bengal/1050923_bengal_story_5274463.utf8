 Oil hotline from Assam

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 22: A pipeline stretching from Golaghat district of Assam to Siliguri will be ready in two years to provide an all-weather transport system for petrol, diesel and kerosene produced at Numaligarh Refinery Ltd. 

 The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs today approved the Rs 468.92-crore proposal which, if executed according to plan, will enable Assams fourth and newest refinery to transport 1.72 million tonnes of petroleum products to Siliguri every year.

 The project had been held up by the railways, which anticipated freight losses after the pipeline is ready. The inability of the railways to provide adequate number of wagons to transport NRL products leads to excess stocks piling up at the refinery. It has to be put on slow mode or even stopped during the monsoon, when flooded tracks throw railway operations in Assam out of gear. 

 The pipeline will not only provide NRL an efficient transport system, but also enable it to operate at full capacity at all times. NRL has an installed capacity of 3 million tonnes an annum, but has been operating only at 2.1 million tonnes bec-ause of the railways failure to meet its transportation needs.

 The petroleum ministry said that with an additional output of 0.9 million tonnes, Siliguri would develop into a huge depot from where the railways could carry petro products to the rest of the country.

 The freight earnings of the railways from NRL are projected to go up from Rs 312 crore to Rs 350 crore. About 80 per cent of NRLs output is transported outside the Northeast. 

 Oil India Ltd already has a 259-km line from Numaligarh to Guwahati and work on the 401-km loop line to Siliguri will start soon. 

 NRL is dependent on its parent company, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, for marketing its products. Most of the retail outlets in the region are owned by Indian Oil Corporation, which prefers to lift products from its own refineries. 

 P.K. Bora, an NRL deputy general manager, said in Guwahati: We have initiated the construction of a receiving terminal in Siliguri and plan to synchronise the completion of the terminal with the completion of the pipeline.

 Cyber vigil night amp; day

 - ICSE site triggers harassment 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 14: An announcement 

 on the official website last night stating that ICSE and 

 ISC results would be declared shortly led to confusion among 

 city students. 

 Thinking the results would be 

 declared any moment, students thronged cyber cafes till 

 late in the night and again since early this morning and 

 surfed the listed sites.

 Clueless, many of them called 

 up their schools today but were unable to contact the authorities 

 as most institutions had closed for summer yesterday itself. 

 The principals of some schools 

 said they had no specific information regarding the announcement 

 of results. 

 The heads of some reputed schools 

 also said there was no possibility of the results being 

 announced till Monday.

 The announcement on the 

 Net was worded in such a way that it seemed that the results 

 would be out any moment. We kept visiting cyber cafes at 

 regular intervals till midnight yesterday and since early 

 morning. This is nothing but harassment, said Shaonli 

 Sarkar (name changed), who studies in a central Calcutta 

 school.

 Medha Bagariya (name changed), 

 a student of a south Calcutta school said: This is 

 our first board examination. What is the point in keeping 

 us on tenterhooks like this? 

 Members and officials of the Council 

 for Indian School Certificate Examinations in Delhi said 

 the results would be declared earliest on Monday.

 There is no possibility 

 of the results being posted on the Net before Monday or 

 Tuesday as the final procedures of preparing the results 

 are still not complete, said an official.

 We understand that the announcement 

 has generated tension among students. But the students must 

 realise that the announcement was not meant to keep them 

 on tenterhooks, he added. 

 There is important information 

 in the announcement, for instance the addresses of the websites 

 on which the results will be posted. There are also instructions 

 on how the students should access the results, said 

 a board source. 

 Over 40,000 students from the 

 city appeared for the ICSE and ISC examinations from over 

 200 schools this year. 

 The principal of a reputed school 

 said some of them had been officially informed that results 

 would be announced latest by May 27. 

 Obviously, the results will 

 be declared much earlier, said a school head. 

 In 2003, the results were announced 

 on May 19. In 2004, they were declared a day before. 

 J.K. Sen, the principal of Julien 

 Day School, Madhyamgram, also the general secretary of the 

 Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools, said the schools 

 are preparing to give away the mark sheets as soon as they 

 arrive.

 The results will be available 

 on the following websites:

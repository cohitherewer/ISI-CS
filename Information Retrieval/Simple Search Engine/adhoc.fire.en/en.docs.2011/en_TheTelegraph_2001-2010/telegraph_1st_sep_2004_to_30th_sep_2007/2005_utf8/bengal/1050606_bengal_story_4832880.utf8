 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, June 5: Inderjit Vijh, the senior National Building Construction Corporation executive who report-edly went missing on Wednesday, has reached home at Bilaspur in Chhattisgarh safely.

 North 24-Parganas police chief Praveen Kumar said he did not board the Calcutta-bound flight from Imphal on June 1 despite having a ticket. Vijh, 55, was on a holiday and supposed to take a train home from Howrah. His relatives, who went to meet him at Dum Dum airport, became worried not seeing him there. They lodged a complaint with airport police two days later. Kumar said: When we contacted his family at Bilaspur, his wife told us that he would soon reach there. She was confident he was not missing and said he had been in touch with her. Vijh reached home at 2.22 this morning. 

 Burdwan: A five-year-old daughter of a businessman was sexually assaulted allegedly by a local youth at Dhaldighi in this town. Doctors at Burdwan Medical College and Hospital said the girl, who had retreated into a shell, was sexually assaulted, not raped. She said Krishna Dey, 30, had called her into his room. He has been arrested.

 Krishnagar: A 25- year-old deaf-mute woman was raped on Saturday near her home at Bijoynagar in Tehatta, about 150 km from Calcutta. Police are looking for a local youth, Tarak Biswas, the alleged culprit.

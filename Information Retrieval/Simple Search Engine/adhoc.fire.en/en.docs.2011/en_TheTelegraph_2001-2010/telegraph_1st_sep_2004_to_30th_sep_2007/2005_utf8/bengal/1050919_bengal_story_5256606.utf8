 Howrah, Sept. 18: Four workers of an eatery were charred to death in Howrah today.

 The fire, apparently caused by an electrical short circuit, turned the room in which they were sleeping into an inferno. Fire brigade personnel cut open the shutters of the restaurant on Andul Road in Sankrail and removed the bodies of Swapan Chowdhury, 40, Deepak Singh, 20, and Anil Thakur, 30, and Babu Ghosh, 20, around 6.30 am. We have arrested the restaurant owner, Bijendra Roy, on charges of criminal negligence, said A.K. Mitra, a Howrah deputy superin- tendent of police.

 Calcutta: About 2.55 lakh candidates appeared in the written test for recruitment of schoolteachers across the state on Sunday. The government will recruit 10,313 teachers for 42 subjects by April.

The results of the written test are expected by December, said Ranajit Basu, the School Service Commission chairman. Last year, over 2.5 lakh took the test, of whom 8,082 qualified for 10,000 vacancies.

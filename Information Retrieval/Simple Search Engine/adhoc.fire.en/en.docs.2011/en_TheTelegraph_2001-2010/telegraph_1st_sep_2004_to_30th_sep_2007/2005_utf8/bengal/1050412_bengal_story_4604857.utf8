 BRIEFS

 Behrampore, April 11: Three doctors were missing from duty and scores of patients waiting at the out-patient department when the health services director went on a surprise visit to the Jalangi subdivisional hospital in Murshidabad this morning.

 Prabhakar Chatterjee, who examined patients with four other doctors and wrote prescriptions, later said: ?I?ve sought the names of the doctors absent. They will be showcaused tomorrow.? In the hospital, 250 km from Calcutta, he also said: ?It is the government?s policy to make doctors more accountable. Those neglecting patients will not be spared.?

 Calcutta: The driver of the Darjeeling Mail that hit a truck near Burdwan on Sunday night and his assistant have been put under temporary suspension. A railway spokesperson said early investigations suggest they had jumped a red light. The truck driver and his helper were killed.

 Siliguri: An alternative to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council will come through in six months, GNLF chief and interim administrator of the council Subash Ghisingh said on Monday. Unlike before, he did not brush aside the long-due council polls, indicating instead that it would be the course once the alternative came through.

 Asim cool to low loan interest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 5: Finance minister Asim Dasgupta today said the recommendations of the 12th Finance Commission would not help in the overall financial improvement of the state as the impact would only be temporary and non-sustainable.

 Dasgupta pointed out that though the rate of interest on central loans has been reduced from 9 per cent to 7 per cent, the Centre has decided to leave interest on loans from small savings out of this ambit. Central grants to Bengal might be beneficial in the first year. But the grants would be reduced the following year and no grant would be offered in the third year, he said.

 Besides, the Centre is likely to ask states to collect 70 per cent of the amount provided under the plan head as loan from agencies in the market.

 Dasgupta said he would urge Union finance minister P. Chidambaram to provide a special grant to Bengal.

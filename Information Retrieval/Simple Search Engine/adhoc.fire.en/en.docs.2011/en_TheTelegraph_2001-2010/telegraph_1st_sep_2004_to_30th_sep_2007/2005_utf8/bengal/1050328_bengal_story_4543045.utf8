 Promise of cheap bypass

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Howrah, March 27: Coronary bypass surgery at perhaps the lowest possible price tag will be available from next week, promises a hospital here that was set up by steel-factory workers.

 ?We will do coronary bypass surgeries for Rs 25,000,? said Anil Saha, secretary, Sramajibi Hospital, Belur.

 ?The patient will be admitted, undergo the surgery, give us the money and go home. No strings attached, no hidden costs,? he added.

 After the inauguration today of the hospital?s cardiac unit, Hriday Chuey, Saha explained how. ?The cost of every operation depends on three things: the machines used, the people involved and the cost of disposables like medicines and syringes.?

 ?In our case, the machines come on donation money and our doctors and other persons involved in surgeries give voluntary service,? Saha said.

 The machines for the cardiac unit have been taken care of. Among the gadgets are a remote-controlled operation table, a five-parameter monitor, a ventilator from Ireland used by cardiac operation theatres (OTs) worldwide and a machine from the US that is used for instant revival of sinking patients.

 ?Only the cost of disposables is charged. In coronary bypass surgeries, however hard you may try, this cost never crosses the Rs 25,000 threshold,? Saha said.

 The entire unit ? which includes a hi-tech OT, an intensive cardiac care unit and a recovery room ? costs Rs 1 crore. ?Already Rs 50 lakh has been raised. The unit is more or less complete. We are waiting for one heart-lung machine from the US,? the secretary said.

 ?We conducted (donation) campaigns all over the state. We also organised a 12-day-long march across Bengal. We have received an immense response from the masses and hope to raise the rest of the money in due course,? Saha added.

 Tripti Adhya, the cardiac surgeon who heads the unit, said one person will be operated every week for now. ?Later, we will perform one surgery every day. We have the facility to conduct two surgeries a day.?

 The spirit of service for free can be traced back to the first batch of 12 employees, including doctors and nurses, that manned the hospital set up in 1994 by workers of a closed steel factory on its premises. ?Now about 50 staff, including 22 doctors, give voluntary service,? Saha said.

 No pushing, says ticket examiner 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 11: The travelling ticket examiner who allegedly pushed out a passenger from the ladies? compartment of a local train on Saturday said from his hospital bed today he was not guilty.

 ?He (the youth) jumped out of the train near Andul station,? Sheikh Samiruddin told senior officials of the South Eastern Railway. 

 The officers quizzed Samiruddin at the railway?s Central Hospital in Garden Reach where he had been admitted following a thrashing. 

 He allegedly pushed the youth out of the Howrah-Mecheda local between Andul and Sankrail stations. Next morning, Government Railway Police personnel found the body of Deepak Paswan, 25, near the track at the same spot. 

 The ticket examiner told the officials he boarded the compartment at Santragachi. ?I detected a passenger travelling without ticket and asked him to pay a fine. At Andul, he jumped out...? 

 A woman, who was in the compartment, had told The Telegraph yesterday there was an argument between a group of ticket examiners and the youth and a hawker had screamed to say he had been pushed out.

 Car crash kills Bina Dasgupta

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, April 8: Jatra actors Bina Dasgupta, 52, and Sanatan Koley, 42, were killed when their car rammed into a stationary truck near Goda in Burdwan police station area early this morning.

 Three persons with Dasgupta, including nephew Tapas Thakur who was driving the car, were seriously injured and taken to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital. The others injured are Sridhar Das and Sudipta Chatterjee.

 Dasgupta was returning to Calcutta after performing in a jatra under the banner of Nabaranjan Opera at Chapui in Ranigunj, said police.

 The car lay unnoticed for some time after crashing into the truck around 5.30 am, said police officials. Actor Rajesh Bhattacharya, who was also returning to Calcutta, saw the wreck and raised the alarm.

 Dasgupta is survived by two sons.

 Dasgupta, born in erstwhile East Pakistan, had started jatra when she was 14 and performed for about four decades in more than 100 plays. She is best known for her roles in Nati Binodini, Meerar Badhua, Achal Paisa and Ma Mati Manush. She performed on stage for the last time last night in Ram Rahimer Ma.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and the state?s acting governor Buta Singh condoled Dasgupta?s death. Bhattacharjee, who is in Delhi to attend the CPM?s party congress, said in his condolence message that Dasgupta continued to entertain innumerable viewers for years and her death has caused a deep loss to jatra.

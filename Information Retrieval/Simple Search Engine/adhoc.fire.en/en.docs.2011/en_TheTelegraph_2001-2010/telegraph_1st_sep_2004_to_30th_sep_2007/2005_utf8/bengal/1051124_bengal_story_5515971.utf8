 Mamata rules out surrender

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 23: With Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury and CPM minister Narayan Biswas in jail, Mamata Banerjee has decided to play it safe.

 The Trinamul Congress chief declared today that she would not surrender in connection with a 1994 clash with police in Barasat in North 24-Parganas.

 Although her name figures on a list of 72,000 people wanted in the state, which was prepared on instructions from the Election Commission, it is not known whether there is a warrant against her. 

 We are not going to surrender in court, come what may. We are not criminals, Mamata told her associates today. 

 Manoj Verma, the acting superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas, said an FIR had been lodged at Barasat police station against 201 people for their alleged involvement in the violence on February 22, 1994.

 Of them, eight ? including Mamata, Pankaj Banerjee and Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay ? are yet to surrender, Verma said. If the court issues arrest warrant against them, we will have to execute it.

 Chattopadhyay, Trinamul chief whip in the Assembly, admitted tonight that he had been involved in the clash which broke out after Congress supporter Gobindo Banerjee was killed in police firing. 

 Mamata was then in the Congress and a rally was organised under the banner of the Youth Congress. We became agitated when police started unprovoked firing, killing one of our supporters, he recounted. 

 Asked if they would surrender, Chattopadhyay said: We have not been officially informed about the case. Let us first get the summons from the court, then we shall decide. 

 Mamata left for Patna this evening by Danapur Express to attend tomorrows swearing-in of Bihar chief minister-designate Nitish Kumar. A one-time foe, Nitish had called Mamata last night.

 The Janata Dal (United) leaders efforts to build bridges with the Trinamul chief has gladdened the NDAs heart. 

 Trinamul sources said BJP president L.K. Advani called up Mamata this afternoon, thanking her for agreeing to attend tomorrows swearing-in.

 15-yr-old held for rape 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

Krishnagar, Feb. 9: Nadia has notched up shocking statistics ? five rapes in four months, including three at Karimpur, where a Class IX student was arrested today on charges of raping a 12-year-old girl. 

 Police said 15-year-old Jahangir Sheikh, a student of Jagannath High School at Karimpur in Nadia, 180 km from Calcutta, intercepted the girl when she was returning with her friends from a musical soiree on the night of January 30, dragged her to some bushes and raped her. 

 The girl?s father, Mannan Sheikh, lodged a complaint with the police last night only after Jahangir?s father, Hasan, refused to cough up Rs 30,000 ? a sum fixed as compensation during a conciliation meeting organised by villagers at the instance of CPM leaders. The meeting also directed Hasan to marry his son to the girl in future. 

 Hasan, a customs employee, refused to accept the decision. The villagers then asked Mannan to lodge an FIR. 

 Karimpur?s CPM legislator Prafulla Bhowmik said the villagers were keen on a settlement because Jahangir is only 15. ?Jahangir has no criminal background and we thought he should be given a chance to mend his ways. Teenagers in these areas often fall victim to bad company and flourishing video parlours showing pornographic films,? he added.

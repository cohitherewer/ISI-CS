 Hong Kong vision in manifesto

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 3: Calcutta could be Hong Kong if the city gives its mayor a second term in office. At least his pre-poll promise sounds no less. 

 Subrata Mukherjees list of intent, which includes gleaming roads, flyovers, footpaths and slum development, came a day after Mamata Banerjee released her manifesto. The Trinamul chiefs plan, however, bypasses flyovers and focuses on illegal settlers.

 Along with state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee, Subrata released the joint manifesto of the United Democratic Alliance tonight. I am willing to sup with the devil to oust the CPM from power, the mayor said.

 It is unfortunate that the Left Fronts mayoral candidate, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, fell into a pothole and broke his leg last night, he added. He might blame the road but it was his fault not to walk carefully. I have tried my best to remove potholes in the past five years. The city has to make its call on June 19.

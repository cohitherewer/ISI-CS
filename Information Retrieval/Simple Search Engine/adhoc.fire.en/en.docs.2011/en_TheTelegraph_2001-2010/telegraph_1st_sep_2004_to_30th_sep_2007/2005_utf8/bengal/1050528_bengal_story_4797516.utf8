 Tech fair giant in New Town

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, May 27: One of Indias biggest multi-utility infrastructure projects, coming up in Bengal, has been launched in Australia and global information and communication technology fair giant CeBIT will invest Rs 40 crore in it, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government said today.

 Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen also announced that CeBIT will organise international buyers for showrooms at Axis, a mall spread over 500,000 sq feet, developed by Bengal Peerless Housing Development Company at New Town, Rajarhat ? the chief ministers pet project. 

 CeBIT Worldwide launched the project earlier this week, inviting bids for space. Government officials feel the Rs 250-crore project will draw investment worth $8 million from companies abroad. 

 Nowhere else in the country will you find a permanent showcase for ICT (information and communication technology) products. This will be the first of its kind, said Kumar Shankar Bagchi of Bengal Peerless. 

 Block A of Axis ? it will have three blocks ? will host showrooms. A rooftop tennis academy will also be part of the project, to be ready in 2008. CeBIT, which is entering India through this project, will occupy a floor, said Jorg Schomburg, the managing director of CeBIT Worldwide, at the launch of Axis at CeBIT Australias convention centre in Sydney.

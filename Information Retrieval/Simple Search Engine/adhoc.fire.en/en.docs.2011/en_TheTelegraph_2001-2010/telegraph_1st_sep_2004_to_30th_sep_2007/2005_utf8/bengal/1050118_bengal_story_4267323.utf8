 CPM eyes civic body

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 17: Alimuddin Street mandarins, including Jyoti Basu and several members of the CPM?s Calcutta district committee, asked party leaders to pull up their socks and wrest the Calcutta Municipal Corporation from the Trinamul Congress.

 ?We have fared well in the last Lok Sabha elections, even in the city proper. So, we don?t find any reason for our party not being able to wrest the civic board from the Trinamul Congress,? Basu was learnt to have told delegates on the second day of the three-day conference of the party?s Calcutta district committee.

 Basu suggested that a formidable leader be put up as the mayoral candidate during the elections to the corporation scheduled to be held in May.

 It is learnt that Raghunath Kusari will be re-elected the district committee secretary.

 However, the delegates observed that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s frequent praises of mayor Subrata Mukherjee had sent wrong signals to the rank and file.

 ?The chief minister as a leader of the party should not have showered praises on the Trinamul mayor who is also a close associate of Mamata Banerjee,? said a senior member of the secretariat.

 The secretariat member reportedly took objection to the chief minister admitting, in the presence of the mayor, that the government had not taken enough initiative to revive the heritage Star Theatre.

 The chief minister, fearing criticism from delegates, instructed urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya to be present at today?s meeting to explain that the government had not gone overboard while complimenting the civic body for its performance.

 Some delegates also criticised the government for not considering the plight of the poor in Calcutta while taking up development activities in the city.

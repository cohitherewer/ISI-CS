 Autonomy on course

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 4: Buckling under pressure from the Centre, the state government today paved the way for autonomous colleges.

 The institutions selected for the status will enjoy full freedom in handling academic affairs, including fixing fees, framing curricula and holding examinations ? as was evident from the recommendations of the Central Advisory Board on Education (Cabe).

 ?We completed the process of preparation of recommendations regarding autonomy in higher education today,? said school education minister Kanti Biswas.

 ?The draft, signed by all the 10 members (of Cabe), will be submitted to the human resources development ministry in Delhi soon for final approval,? said Biswas, chairman of the board, after a meeting with a two-member team from the University Grants Commission.

 The minister said the Cabe has held several rounds of meetings, workshops and seminars with academics and teachers? bodies on autonomy in higher education.

 The board?s report has about 60 ?salient recommendations?, which are divided into three sections ? ?academic, financial and administrative?.

 The draft is particularly significant for Bengal, where higher education is perceived to be a preserve of the ruling Left Front. Autonomous colleges have opened in many other states.

 ?Inputs received from various stakeholders (academics and organisations running educational institutions) not only show concern for the eroding autonomy in academic institutions (mostly universities), but they were equally concerned about the overall lack of accountability in the higher education system in the country,? the board says in its report.

 Hill council staff under state control

 VIVEK CHHETRI

 Darjeeling, March 15: The DGHC amendment bill, which was passed in the Assembly yesterday, has handed over complete control of its employees to the state government at a time when hill council chief Subash Ghisingh is demanding devolution of powers.

 The DGHC act of 1988 is silent on the recruitment system, but an amendment to the legislation in 1994 made provisions for filling up high-level positions from the central and state cadre.

 The 1994 amendment also made a provision (Section 51 [1] and [2]) under which the hill council could appoint Group C and D personnel with the state government?s approval. 

 However, the government, in the new amendment bill, has inserted a sub-section ?to incorporate the provisions for empowering the government to frame rules regulating the method of and qualification required of officers and other employees of the executive council of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council?.

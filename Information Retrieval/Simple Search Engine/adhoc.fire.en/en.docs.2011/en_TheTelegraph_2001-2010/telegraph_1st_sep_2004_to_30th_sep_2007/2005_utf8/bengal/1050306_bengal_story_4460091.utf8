 Row over security at Santiniketan

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Santiniketan, March 5: Fed up with rising cases of theft and ?inadequate security arrangements? at Visva-Bharati, about 20 students allegedly ransacked a security office in Sriniketan last night after four cycles were stolen from a boys? hostel. 

 University authorities have ordered a probe to identify the students involved in the ransacking. 

 Infuriated students of Palli Shiksha Bhavan, the university?s agricultural institute, today started an agitation. ?We were busy preparing for our examination at night. Around 12, there was a power cut. When the electricity supply resumed, we found four cycles had been stolen from the hostel. It?s happening repeatedly,? said Sanjit Maity, a fourth year student of agriculture.

 ?Nothing is safe here. Even a fuse or clothes left for drying, Walkmans and CDs have gone missing from the hostel. So we shouted at the securitymen. But we have not caused any damage,? the student said.

 The incident and the agitation today delayed a fourth year agriculture paper examination by an hour. Instead of 8 am, the test started at 9 am.

 Preliminary investigation, according to the authorities, has revealed that two telephones and some pieces of furniture were damaged in the security office.

 ?Vice-chancellor Sujit Basu has instructed me to initiate a probe to identify the students involved in the ransacking and we will take necessary steps through the adhyaksha of Palli Shikhsa Bhavan against those found guilty,? the university?s security officer, Arup Sil, said.

 ?If they have some grievances, they should tell us. They should not take the law into their hands,? the security official added.

 Asked if security had been tightened after the incident, Sil said: ?We don?t have sufficient staff strength at Sriniketan to beef up security.?

 Marks mess sours taste of MSc

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Burdwan, Dec. 16: After the fiasco over BCom Part I results in Burdwan University, it is Kalyanis turn. 

 Kalyani University has taken back mark sheets of 45 students, who had appeared in the Part I MSc (Zoology) examination last year and Part II in 2005, after some serious mistakes were detected. 

 Their Part I results were declared in August 2004 and Part II this November. 

 The students, over a dozen of who had got first-class marks, are clueless about the type of mistakes that had crept into their mark sheets and the university would not reveal them, at least for the moment. 

 Vice-chancellor Arabinda Kumar Das, who assumed chair in September, is abroad and is expected to join on December 26. Asit Saha, the officiating VC has no knowledge about the mark sheet problem. I have to enquire about it before making a comment, Saha said. Controller of examinations Pradip Karori was not available for comments. 

 A university insider, however, said the serious mistakes were a result of negligence of the department of controller of examinations. 

 The students who do not have their mark sheets now will not be able to sit for competitive exams or apply for jobs despite having completed their MSc.

 In Burdwan, results of the BCom Part-I (general) examination were declared cancelled in October. Over 2,669 students who had appeared in the exam had been awarded wrong marks because of an error by a local computer firm contracted for preparing mark sheets.

 CPM assessment

 Calcutta, Dec. 20: The CPM leadership today reviewed reports from the partys district units on its prospects in the 2006 Assembly polls, especially in the light of equations between Mamata Banerjees Trinamul Congress, the BJP and the Congress.

 Spread over seven hours and split into two halves, the CPM state committees meeting formulated the partys approach to the elections. We are confident of regaining power for the sev- enth consecutive term based on two things, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments performance and the partys political initiative, state party secretary Anil Biswas said. This time, our performance will break all previous records, he added.

 Jyoti Basu said a loose, informal coming together of the Congress and the Trinamul-BJP could not be ruled out as it is in the nature of the Congress to pander to communal forces.

 The party discussed how to maintain balance while selecting nominees, replacing, if necessary, senior ministers with younger functionaries. Ministers overseeing departments that have a bearing on peoples welfare and those who have been slow to respond to popular needs would be called for an audit of performance, Biswas said.

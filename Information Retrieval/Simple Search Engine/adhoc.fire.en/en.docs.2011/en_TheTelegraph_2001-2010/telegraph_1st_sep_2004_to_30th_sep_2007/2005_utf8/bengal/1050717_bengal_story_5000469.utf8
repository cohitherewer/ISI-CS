 French hand in food plant

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore (Murshidabad), July 16: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said a Rs 380-crore food processing project with French collaboration would soon come up at Jangipur, about 250 km from Calcutta. 

 The proprietor of Pataka Bidi Company, Mustaque Hossein, has undertaken the ambitious project in collaboration with a French concern. If everything goes according to plan, the project will come up by the end of the year, Bhattacharjee said.

 The chief minister said he had introduced Mustaque to the French agriculture minister in Calcutta last year. During his visit (to France), he signed an MoU (memorandum of understanding) with the French.

 The plant will come up on a 70-acre plot, he said. Bhattacharjee announced that the company would produce glucose from potato, among other things. The French government and companies will buy most of the products.

 Moving on to other projects, the chief minister said Ambuja Cement has decided to use fly ash from a National Thermal Power Corporation plant in Farakka to manufacture cement at its factory there.

 The setting up of industries at Jangipur and Farakka will change the character of the subdivision. A large number of local youths will get employment, he said.

 Bhattacharjee inaugurated a project through which the animal husbandry department will distribute 10 lakh chickens and ducklings among 1 lakh women in the district at a nominal cost.

 Murshidabad zilla parishad sabhadhipati Siddiqua Begum discussed with Bhattacharjee steps to prevent erosion by the Padma. 

 Later, the chief minister said the government is concerned about erosion at Jalangi and Panchanandapur. I have been told that more than 180 families from the affected areas have taken shelter under trees. The administration will provide them food until they are rehabilitated, he said before leaving for Malda.

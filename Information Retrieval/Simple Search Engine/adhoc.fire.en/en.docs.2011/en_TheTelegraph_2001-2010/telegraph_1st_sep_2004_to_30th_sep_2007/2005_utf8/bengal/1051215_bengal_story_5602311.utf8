 3,000 off poll rolls

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 14: The names of 3,000 people, who have non-bailable arrest warrants pending against them, have been struck off the voters list after they failed to appear before the electoral registration officer.

 The Election Commission had directed that names of those against whom warrants are pending for more than six months should be deleted if they do not appear before the electoral registration officer and declare themselves residents of the addresses given in the electoral rolls.

 From a list of 72,000-odd names, the state chief electoral officer (CEO) and his team had managed to locate only 11,700 people, to whom notices were sent. 

 The CEOs office has received several complaints about the intervention of CPM workers in the hearings of people who want their names included in the voters list. 

 Parties can be informally involved in the identification of voters during hearings, but they are not permitted inside the booth, said CEO Debashish Sen.

 Of the 11,700 notices sent to absconders, 8,000 cases have been disposed of so far.

 Officials blamed incomplete police records for the poor strike rate.

 A majority of the names on the list could not be located as the police did not supply us with adequate information. In most cases, either the name or the address in the police records is wrong. As of now, nothing can be done about these people unless the police give us fresh information, Sen said.

 Wanted: clean ex-criminals

 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN 

 Behrampore, June 19: Police in Murshidabad are on the lookout for criminals. Well, thats what they should be doing.

 But the hunt is not for ordinary or everyday criminals, but those who have quit business and now carry a clean image.

 A competition will be held to select the top three keeping away from criminal activities and maintaining the clean image. Cash awards and good-conduct certificates will be up for grabs.

 All 26 police stations have been asked to send the names of two local criminals with a good record to superintendent Sanjoy Singh. The top three will get Rs 2,000, Rs 1,500 and Rs 1,000 along with a good conduct certificate.

 The drive, the police brass believe, will bring anti-social elements back to the mainstream. The competition is likely to be held mid-July.

 According to Singh, there are two chief criteria for selection. First, the candidate must be an ex-criminal with a record of dacoity and murder. Second, he/she must be engaged in some clean work. 

 Singh said: I will select the topper from the 52 names sent to me on the basis of their non-performance as criminals. The first prize will go to the ex-criminal who does not have any criminal record for the longest period in the recent past.

 Singhs move follows the success of the Samsergunj police station in rehabilitating ex-criminals in its transport protection committee. As members of the group, a number of local ex-criminals have been serving as night guards and helping the police monitor transport movement.

 Dipak Das, the officer-in-charge of the police station, has decided to recommend the names of Laltu Sheikh and Abbas Sheikh to the district police chief. 

 Laltu was involved in several dacoities, murders and abductions in the district as well as in neighbouring Jharkhand. Since 1999, when Laltu joined the transport protection committee, the police have not received a complaint against him. Similarly, no complaint has been registered against Abbas, another dreaded ex-criminal, in about six years.

 Initially, a dozen cases were pending against him. I have been acquitted in four, but eight others are still there. I joined the transport protection committee in 1999 and am now on bail. I can now hold my head high. Many others like me are now returning to the mainstream, Abbas said.

 Ranjan Sinha, the officer-in-charge of the Suti police station, has named Azad Sheikh of Ajagarpara village and Dhana Sheikh of Chander Mor for the competition. No crime was reported against them in the past year.

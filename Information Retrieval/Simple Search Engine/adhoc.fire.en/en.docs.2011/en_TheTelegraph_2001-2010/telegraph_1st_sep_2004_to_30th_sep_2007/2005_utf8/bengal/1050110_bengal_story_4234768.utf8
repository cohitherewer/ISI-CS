 Picnic fatal for four

 OUR BUREAU

 Jan. 9: Four picnickers drowned in merriment and deafened by blaring music were mowed down by a speeding train on a bridge across the Dwarakeswar river near Bankura town this morning.

 The dead included a girl of seven. Police identified them as Tumpa Mekgan, 20, Pakhi Das, 20, Basudeb Mahadani, 22, and Lakshmi Malakar.

 Lakshmi Mukhi, 30, is fighting for her life at Bankura Sammilani Medical College and Hospital. From Ashrampara in Bankura town, the revellers had come to Surpanagar, about 230 km from Calcutta. 

 The police said three bodies were mutilated, almost beyond recognition. Lakshmi jumped to death on the dried-up river in trying to avoid the train.

 An officer said: ?The loudspeakers of picnic parties prevented them from hearing the train coming.? Government Railway Police officials in Bankura town said the train driver had blown the horn several times.

 ?The train left Kharagpur for Ranchi and passed the area around 11 am,? said Bankura superintendent of police Anil Kumar.

 The group of five had broken away from the rest to take snaps. 

 ?They climbed up the incline to the bridge. There is a long and narrow iron plate along the tracks that serves as a path for local people. Apart from not being able to hear the train coming, they were probably blinded by a turn,? said the officer.

 Several groups of picnickers flock to the river bank every Sunday. District officials said the bridge is a favourite among the merrymakers. There were about a dozen groups today and all of them were armed with one or more loudspeakers.

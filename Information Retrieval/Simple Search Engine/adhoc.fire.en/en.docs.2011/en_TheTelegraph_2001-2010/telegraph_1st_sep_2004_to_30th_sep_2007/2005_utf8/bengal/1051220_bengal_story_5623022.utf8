 Rites by road red-light traffic

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 19: Traffic on a state highway in Nadia came to a halt today as over 500 people converged on the roadside to take part in the last rites of an 80-year-old woman who had been driven out of home by her daughter-in-law.

 Police struggled to keep traffic on the move near Karimpur, 175 km from Calcutta, as it dared not resist an occasion steeped with emotion for the residents of Mahishbathan. We could have resorted to a lathicharge but we restrained ourselves as a mark of respect to the local sentiment, a police officer said.

 Snehalata Saha was driven out of her home six months ago as her daughter-in-law Archana found her a burden in the family. Her husband Sadananda, a cook on hire but now virtually jobless, said: Archana lost her head when I could not continue the education of my son, a student of Class VIII. 

 She got more angry as I did not get any help from my two brothers, who earn well and have separated. After I told my wife that I could not afford to continue our sons education, she asked my mother to go to one of my brothers. My mother refused to leave me and she drove her out.

 Snehalata, who had found a shelter at a bus stand on the highway, died of cold and exposure 13 days ago. Archana did not let Sadananda perform her last rites. 

 Local residents raised around Rs 1,000 and asked him to perform the shraddh at the bus stand, where she spent the last few months. We used to see the old woman shivering.... Sadanandas wife did not treat her well, said Mahadeb Ghosh, the local panchayat pradhan. 

 Archana and her son were closeted at home when vehicles were piling on the road linking Krishnagar with Karimpur.

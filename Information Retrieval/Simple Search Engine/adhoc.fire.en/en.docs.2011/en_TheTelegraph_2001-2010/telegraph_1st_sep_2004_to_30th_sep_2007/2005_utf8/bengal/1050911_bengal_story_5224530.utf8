 Smuggler ship caught

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Calcutta, Sept. 10: A shipment of smuggled cane seeds from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands has been intercepted by the forest department at Calcutta Port. 

 The seeds, valued at nearly Rs 3 lakh, were hidden under betel nuts in 63 bags on the MV Nazir, a cargo ship from Port Blair. 

 Forest officials claim this is the first instance of a cargo ship being seized and raided for smuggled goods. 

 On a tip-off, forest department officials, in co-ordination with their island counterparts raided the ship a few days back and found the smuggled seeds.

 The ship has been seized also but since we do not have any provision to keep a ship, we have handed it over to the Calcutta Port authorities, Prabhas Ranjan Chakrab- orty, divisional forest officer (forest utilisation division) of the state forest department said today. 

 According to the West Bengal Forest Produce Transit Rule, 1959, any forest produce, while being transpo- rted or sold, should have authorisation from the forest department. 

 The consignment of cane seeds ? rare forest products ? did not have any such documents and so, were seized.

 We had information that skins of wild animals were being brought from Port Blair to Calcutta on this ship. However, after the raid, cane seeds were found, Chakraborty said. 

 The bags had betel nuts placed neatly on the top. But after these were removed, the cane seeds were discovered.

 Chakraborty said this is the first time that a big cargo ship has been seized by the forest department. 

 Earlier, skins of wild animals were seized from people coming from the islands on board passenger ships. 

 Immediately after the ship was raided, Chakraborty received an anonymous phone call. 

 The caller was speaking in Hindi. He asked me why the goods had been seized and wanted to know what was to be done, Chakraborty said.

 The man, who refused to identify himself, claimed he was calling from the Andamans. Chakraborty told the caller to surrender but he hung up.

 The smugglers, however, could not be traced as they did not register their names or addresses with the cargo. 

 The consignment did not have any senders slip. This is extremely surprising and we suspect a nexus between a section of agents and the smugglers, an official said.

 Forest officials feel the seizure of the cane seeds is only the tip of the iceberg. 

 A big network of smugglers is operating on the islands, an official said. 

 He said the forest department, along with island officials, is probing how many gangs are operating. 

 Calcutta is one of the main points through which animal hide, horns, corals and forest products are smuggled outside the country. 

 It is a serious problem and we are keeping vigil at the Calcutta port to intercept any such smuggled goods, said V. K. Yadav, the deputy chief wildlife warden of the forest department.

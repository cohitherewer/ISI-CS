 Buddha rap on Academy operation 

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Jan. 15: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today voiced his displeasure at the way a police team stormed the Academy of Fine Arts auditorium on Thursday evening in search of an actor accused of cheating and rape.

 The actor, Rudranil Ghosh, apparently a member of the cast of Phataru, which was being staged, was not present when the team from Regent Park and Hastings police stations rushed in even as the curtains fell.

 ?Police are at liberty to arrest an accused in accordance with the law. But the manner in which police tried to storm the auditorium in order to arrest an actor cannot be a policy of the government. It was unbecoming of policemen to act in such a fashion,? Bhattacharjee said in a statement.

 The chief minister said he had spoken to commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and asked him to warn the officer concerned. 

 Forty-eight hours after the incident, Ghosh is still at large. ?After all that has happened, we are not in a position to think about him. The controversy has hit us hard and we have decided to go slow,? said an officer connected with case.

 None in the city police was willing to explain why the team stormed into the theatre without permission and later put the brakes on the probe. Sources said the swift action as well as the slowdown were because of conflicting pressure from different quarters.

 Mukherjee said the police had no ?intention? to either ?disturb the sanctity of the place? or disrupt the play. ?It could have been handled better.?

 Questions are now being raised why the concerned police officer ? additional officer-in-charge of the Hastings police station ? did not consult either the deputy commissioner or even the assistant commissioner of police before the raid. ?Besides, he should have sought the permission of the director of the Academy of Fine Arts, Lt Col. A.K. Das, and the director of the theatre group,? said an officer.

 A section of the city?s police brass questioned the urgency with which the raid was carried out. ?The charge of attempt to molestation loses its sting if lodged days after the incident has happened. Considered in that light, the case really doesn?t hold much. So why this urgency? Or was it a court order?? wondered a top officer.

 Insiders in South 24-Parganas district police claimed the raid was conducted after an order issued by the sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court in Alipore following a complaint lodged by actor Oindrila Chakraborty.

 DC (South) Anuj Sharma refused to comment. ?Since the case involves a district and Calcutta Police, it would not be proper for me to comment on the case but I have sought a report from the assistant commissioner,? he said.

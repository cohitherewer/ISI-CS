 Four short, boy kills himself

 Krishnagar, June 20: A Class IX student committed suicide by consuming poison today after his school refused to grant the four marks needed for his promotion to Class X.

 Trishul Majumdar of Hanskhalis SM Vidyamandir had failed in the annual examination. With six others, who needed two to seven more for pass marks, he went to school today following the headmasters assurance that their cases would be considered. But barring a student who needed two, no one was promoted, Trishuls cousin Biswajit Biswas said. Villagers found him writhing in pain in a field around noon.

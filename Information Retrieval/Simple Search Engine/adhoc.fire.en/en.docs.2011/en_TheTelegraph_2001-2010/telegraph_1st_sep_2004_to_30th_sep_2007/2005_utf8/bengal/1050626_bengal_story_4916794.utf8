 Bombs boom and bullets fly in station

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 25: A year after a woman was brutally assaulted by a group of drunk men, the Hridaypur railway station platform on the northern fringes of the city turned into a battlefield again last night. 

 Two groups, believed to be rival factions of the CPM, went on a shooting spree in the crowded platform triggering panic among commuters.

 Before going berserk at the station, they hurled bombs in surrounding areas while searching for their rivals. After 20 minutes of fire and fury, the goons walked out of the station with the railway police reduced to spectators. Parveen Kumar, the North 24-Parganas police chief, said seven persons were arrested. Besides, we have seized four motorcycles used by the attackers. A massive hunt is on to track down the rest of the culprits, he added.

 Witnesses said the incident took place around 7 pm when platform No. 2 was teeming with commuters. A group of 20, some of them identified as Babu, Biswa, Nawaz and Desho, attacked a saloon and beat up its owner, Anup Kumar. After failing to locate their rivals, they fired indiscriminately, said an officer of the Barasat police station.

 On hearing the sound of firing, the waiting passengers started fleeing. Some them jumped onto the tracks and injured themselves, the officer said.

 The police said the trouble started brewing when hundreds of youths assembled in front of the Barasat municipality on the occasion of the chairmans oath taking. Rival groups had been threatening each other from then, said an officer working on the case.

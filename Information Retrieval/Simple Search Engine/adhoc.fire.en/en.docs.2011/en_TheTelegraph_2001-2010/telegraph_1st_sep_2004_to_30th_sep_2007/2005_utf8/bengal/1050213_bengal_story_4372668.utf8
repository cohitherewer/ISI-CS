 Teacher pays for govt error

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Feb. 12: A government error has cost Kalyani Haldar dear.

 In 2001, Kalyani from Nabagram in Murshidabad, 230 km from Calcutta, had got a job in nearby Joychandrapur after the panchayat department directed the CPM-led zilla parishad to recruit primary school teachers who had passed Class X. 

 She worked on a salary of Rs 1,000 a month. However, after two years, her appointment was cancelled when a clarification was issued on the government order, saying the teachers should have a higher secondary certificate. 

 Ever since, the 47-year-old housewife has been suffering from chronic depression. Sometimes, she tears out her hair and hurls stones at strangers. 

 A mother of two, Kalyani was the sole earning member of the family. Her husband Soumen earns a paltry sum teaching music in the neighbourhood.

 ?My wife used to earn about Rs 800 a month from private tuitions. But after she joined the school, she was forced to give them up because she could not manage so much work along with looking after the household. We don?t understand how she was summarily dismissed from service after being given a proper appointment letter,? Soumen said.

 Former sabhadhipati of the Murshidabad zilla parishad, Sachchidananda Kandari, said: ?The clarification came much later. So it is possible that apart from Kalyani, a few others have also suffered.?

 Shop break-in at dawn

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 13: A gang broke into a shop on Russell Street at the crack of dawn and made off with Rs 1.98 lakh from the cash box.

 The incident came to light later in the day when the staff opened the shop that sells fabrics for home furnishing. 

 Officers-in-charge of 15 police stations of the south division patrol the streets every night, but the robbery had escaped the notice.

 The gang had lifted a tiny portion of the shutters ? it was so small that the workers failed to see it when they arrived this morning ? to sneak in. 

 Officers from the detective departments anti-burglary wing suspect it to be the job of youths in the 14-16 age group. 

 They believe the same gang, which has been wreaking havoc across the city for the past two months, was involved in the break-in at a Loudon Street garment shop a few weeks ago. 

 The gang evidently knew that the glass door of the shop (on Russell Street) was broken. One had to simply lift the shutters to step inside. And that is what they did. The operation has been carried out in a manner that would leave anyone stumped. We are still groping for a clue, said Gana Nath Mukherjee, the officer-in-charge of Shakespeare Sarani police station. 

 The gangs first target was an electronics shop in Gariahat when they walked away with mobile phones worth around Rs 1 lakh. Once inside, the gang members look for a way out and if there is one, they go for things, or else they settle for cash, said an officer of the detective department.

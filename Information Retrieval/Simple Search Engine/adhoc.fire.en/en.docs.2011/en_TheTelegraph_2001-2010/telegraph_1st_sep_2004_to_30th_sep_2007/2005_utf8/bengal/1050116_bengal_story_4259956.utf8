 Calcutta, Jan. 15: It is not clear if news of the barbarity in Tollygunge police station had reached him, but Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee chose a police function not far away to deliver a sermon to the force on the importance of being humane. 

 ?The public perception that our policemen are a baton wielding lot must change,? the chief minister said at the closing ceremony of the Calcutta Police annual sports meet at Alipore. 

 ?Policing is a difficult task, but it would do a world of good if you present a kind face to victims of crimes or injustice or the toiling cops presented their human face while dealing with the masses. The perception that policing is only about lathi-wielding would undergo a change,? he told the personnel. 

 ?I feel great watching policemen helping children cross roads safely. But that?s not all. If required, help someone catch a cab or an ailing person an ambulance at night. Pay attention to popular expectations,? Bhattacharjee said. 

 After the lecture, came a pat on the back, for maintenance of law and order. ?You can compare with any other metro city and still we are the best. The police have consistently delivered on special occasions, including the major festivals, and it remains a matter of great pride for all of us,? Bhattacharjee said. 

 He admitted the state?s duty to ensure healthcare and housing for all in the force. ?It?s the government?s responsibility to ensure that police personnel get the best of medicare and even if the police hospital is not equipped to deliver the same, the state would strive to meet all the expenses,? he said. 

 ?I would like to call upon the police commissioner to see to it that no police personnel is denied the best of medicare. Its our responsibility to ensure that the problems of healthcare and housing are addressed to so as to get the best from each,? he added.

 Father rapes amp; proposes

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, July 20: A man, who has been allegedly raping his teenaged daughter regularly for the past one year and wanted to marry her, was arrested last night from a village in West Midnapore district.

 The 16-year-old had fled to the house of her stepmothers sister in Benapur village in the Kharagpur area, 125 km from Calcutta. 

 Her father Panchanan Bairagi, a 49-year-old daily labourer from Raghunathpur village in the same district, followed her there and tried to force her to come back home. He also said he would marry her.

 I am shaken by this incident. I have not come across such cruelty in my life as a police officer so far, said Sukhendu Bej, the subdivisional police officer (SDPO) of Kharagpur.

 According to the girls statement to the police, Panchanan would also regularly rape his elder daughter till she got married and left for Delhi a year ago. 

 The police said they would investigate whether the elder daughter was married off or sold to flesh traders.

 Bej said both the girls were the daughters of Panchanans first wife Jaba, who died five years ago. He later married Jamuna.

 The teenagers nightmare began soon after her sisters wedding. I tried to keep away from him but he used to threaten me with a knife and forced me to go to bed with him. I told my stepmother. But, she, too, could not do anything as my father threatened her with life. When we told the villagers, they did not believe us, the girl told the police.

 The villagers, who had organised a shalishi (a conciliation meeting) to discuss the matter, asked the girl and her stepmother to go to the police. Panchanan did not turn up at the meeting.

 On June 12, Jamuna and Panchanan had a fight and he told her that he would marry his daughter. The next day, Jamuna helped the girl escape to Benapur to her sisters place. But my father followed me to that house and again raped me when my stepmothers sister and her husband were not around, the teenager said.

 Five days later, Panchanan wanted to take his daughter home and formally marry her. Jamuna arrived in Benapur and raised a hue and cry. Villagers then caught hold of Panchanan and handed him over to the police, said Bej.

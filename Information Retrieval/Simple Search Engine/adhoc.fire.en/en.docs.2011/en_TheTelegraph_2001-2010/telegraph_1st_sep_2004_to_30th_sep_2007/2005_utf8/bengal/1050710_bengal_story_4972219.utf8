 Maoist alert in Burdwan

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, July 9: More than 30 Maoists have slipped into Burdwan from the adjoining districts of Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore, police said today.

 The statement rang an alert about the presence of Naxalites in the district and came hours after the interrogation of Dhajadhari Chatterjee and Sushen Mahato, who were arrested yesterday in connection with the murder of a CPM leader in Burdwan.

 Police today raided Mahatos Mining and Allied Machinery Corporation colony residence and seized several photographs that revealed how guerrilla training camps were being run in the dense forest areas of Purulia. Several books showing how to use landmines and prepare explosives were also seized.

 Police claimed the photographs and information collected from todays raids would be exchanged with their counterparts in Purulia and a database on Maoist activity would be built.

 Mahato ? a resident of Purulia and an automobile mechanic in a private firm ? has been staying with his family at the MAMC colony for long. Chatterjee ? the assistant secretary of the Aituc-backed labour union at the Durgapur Steel Plant ? lived in the town.

 Police arrested the two during raids on their residences and were kept in police custody at the Durgapur police station lockup under strict vigil.

 Constables with .303 rifles were replaced by a special force armed with self-loading guns.

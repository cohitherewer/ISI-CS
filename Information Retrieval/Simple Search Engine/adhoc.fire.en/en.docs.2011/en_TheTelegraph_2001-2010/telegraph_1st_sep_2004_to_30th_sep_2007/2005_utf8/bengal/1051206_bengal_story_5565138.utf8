 Buddha date with Gates gone for Ghisingh

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Buddhadeb and Bill: Hard-pressed

 Calcutta, Dec. 5: The Bengal chief ministers date with the Microsoft boss had to be can- celled virtually at the last minute as Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had to leave for Delhi this evening to attend a rescheduled meeting on the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council.

 The meeting with Bill Gates was fixed at the initiative of the Microsoft chairman two weeks ago. Then the DGHC meeting was scheduled for November 29.

 At that point of time, there was no problem as the chief minister was free and he readily agreed to the appointment. However, the problem arose when the DGHC meeting was deferred and rescheduled on December 6, an official in the chief ministers secretariat said this evening.

 Realising that he would have to leave for Delhi an evening in advance, the chief minister wanted to reschedule the appointment and officials in his secretariat were constantly in touch with Microsoft officials. After co-ordinating through all of yesterday, it became apparent this afternoon that Gates could not fly into the city before late evening. 

 The chief minister was ready to take the 7.50-pm flight to Delhi and accommodate Gates if he could reach Calcutta by 5 pm. However, around noon, he sent word that he could reach Calcutta only around 8 pm. The chief minister couldnt wait for so long as another meeting was scheduled in Delhi this evening where the state chief secretary and home secretary, the Union home secretary and Subash Ghisingh were to finalise a draft agreement to be signed tomorrow, said the official. 

 While leaving Writers Buildings this afternoon, Bhattacharjee said: I havent been able to make it? Im having to leave for Delhi this evening.

 Bhattacharjee is slated to sign a memorandum of settlement on Sixth Schedule status for DGHC tomorrow.

 Instead of coming to Calcutta, Gates, who was travelling on a chartered aircraft from Bangladesh, flew to Delhi. It is not known if Bhattacharjee will meet Gates there. 

 Officially, nothing is on, an official said, adding: But we dont know if any development will take place in Delhi. 

 IT secretary G.D. Gautama said: Wed been asking Microsoft to set up their next development centre in Calcutta and we are in touch with them for over a year now.

 Microsoft is now involved in a school education project, using a Windows operating system in Bengali. It has also proposed teachers training projects and promised to set up an IT academy and a language laboratory to facilitate development of software applications in Bengali.

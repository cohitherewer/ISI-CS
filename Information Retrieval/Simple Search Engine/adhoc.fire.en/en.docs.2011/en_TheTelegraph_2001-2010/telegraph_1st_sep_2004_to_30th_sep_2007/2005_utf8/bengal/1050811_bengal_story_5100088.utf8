 Starvation stench back in Amlashol

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Aug. 10: The spectre of starvation has returned to haunt West Midnapores Amlashol with a person from the Shabar tribe allegedly dying of hunger last Thursday.

 Since June last year, eight persons have died of starvation in the village.

 Gantu Shabars widow Pulumoni and several villagers said the 37-year-old, who was suffering from tuberculosis for a long time, died due to starvation. But the district administration denied it.

 Block development officer Subhashis Bej said Gantu passed away a week ago. We do not know how he died. But we can assure you that there is no shortage of jobs and so there is no reason why one should die of starvation, he said.

 Asked if Gantu had died of any disease, Bej said: I cant say this. Only the health department can say.

 Hiralal Bishui, the block medical officer of health at the Belpahari primary health centre, confirmed the man was suffering from tuberculosis. Gantu was admitted to our health centre with TB and was treated for five days. After his release, we asked him to return to his village and told him that our medical team would visit him to reach him medicines. But he refused to take the medicines and died of TB as a result. 

 Pulumoni said her ailing husband was without work and the couple could not arrange a square meal a day. They went to the adjoining Burijhore village in search of a job, but we had to return disheartened as we could not find any, she said.

 Ratai Shabar, a villager, said some people had got work before the monsoon. We were engaged in road constructions and pond excavations. But ever since the monsoon set in, employments have stopped. Moreover, we cant sell firewood or the kendu leaves as they are soggy from the rains. So we have no means of earning money to buy foodgrain. Starvation exists in many homes in Amlashol.

 His neighbour Radhu Shabar said hunger claimed her two-year-old daughter Pentli in end-June this year. We could not give food to our child. She died in front of our eyes. 

 Bishui, however, said Pentli had been suffering from diarrhoea and had died of the disease.

 Coach property under probe

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 4: CBI sleuths are now going through documents seized from the houses of East Bengal coach Subhas Bhowmick, arrested on bribery charges during raids carried out in the past 24 hours. 

 The star striker of the 1970s was caught accepting cash from a businessman in his capacity as a Central Excise (evasion) superintendent in front of a south Calcutta club on Friday. 

 CBI director U.S. Mishra, who came to the city on a scheduled visit tonight, is expected to enquire about the case at a meeting with his officers at Nizam Palace tomorrow. 

 Bhowmick had allegedly promised to secure the busi-nessman a refund on his ex-cise duty against a bribe of Rs 1.5 lakh. The bureau laid a trap after the businessman lodged a complaint. 

 The soccer coach was produced in the CBIs special court in Alipore yesterday and remanded in jail custody till December 9. 

 Officers are now trying to match Bhowmicks list of assets and investments with his income. 

 Our prime job now is to find out whether there is any discrepancy in his assets and earnings. We have found some vital leads that indicate he had invested several lakhs in properties that do not match his income, said a CBI officer working on the case. 

 Another officer, who raided Bhowmicks house in Bolpur, said he was stunned on seeing it. When we reached the house, we were stunned. It is on a 29-cottah plot. Acc- ording to our estimate, the value of the building will not be less than Rs 30 lakh.

 In Bhowmicks New Alipore apartment, the sleuths found Rs 30,000 and documents relating to share investments. We are not disclosing the value of the shares for the sake of the investigation, the officer said. A CBI team that went to the State Bank of Indias Tollygunge branch yesterday found jewellery worth Rs 6.88 lakh. 

 He has eight bank accounts where he also kept a considerable amount of money. We are trying to find out from where the money came, a detective said.

 The CBI has also come to know that Bhowmick had taken a Rs 17-lakh bank loan for his daughters studies in London. 

 The bank must have granted him the amount against some investment documents, an officer said, adding: Were trying to find out how he was repaying the loan.

 Bhowmick, who earns Rs 20,000 a month from the excise department and Rs 11 lakh a year (according to this years contract) from East Bengal, is now in the hospital at Alipore Central Jail.

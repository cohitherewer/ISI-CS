 IAS officers run from Bihar poll job

 Calcutta, Oct. 9: Like children who bunk school on various pretexts, Bengals IAS officers, who were called for election duty to neighbouring Bihar, are crying off citing one reason or the other.

 I cannot be expected to drop everything and leave for Bihar. My mother is unwell, said an officer known to be experienced in conducting elections. He requested anonymity.

 Yes, Bihar is next door, but you know Bihar is Bihar, said another. 

 Outgoing state chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee has been a harried man for some time.

 Since the Election Commission asked Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government to depute 40 IAS officers on election duty in the Bihar polls, Banerjees phone hasnt stopped ringing, with his colleagues begging for what they called his mercy.

 The states personnel and administrative reforms department had forwarded 40 names to the poll panel, but with officials citing reasons ranging from illness in family to the dengue epidemic in the state for exemption from duty, the list has already been reduced to about half. 

 The officers were to be nominated observers for 40 Bihar Assembly constituencies.

 Banerjee admitted that exemptions had to be made as some officials were going abroad while some others had cited illness and other family problems. Some of them had to be withdrawn also for either they or their spouses hailed from Bihar.

 Officials at Writers Buildings, who also requested anonymity, said everyone was averse to going to Bihar. 

 In addition to the usual perception of violence and lawlessness, amenities there are basic to say the least. The Election Commissions directive makes it mandatory for observers to stay within the constituency they are overseeing. Gone are days of comfortable living in circuit houses in the district headquarters, said a senior official.

 Municipal affairs secretary Debashish Som is believed to have pulled out of the Bihar fray citing important work with regard to the dengue epidemic in the city. 

 Interestingly, health department special secretary S. Suresh Kumar, who was monitoring the dengue situation, is being sent to Bihar instead.

 The commission has issued a showcause notice to Arnab Roy, a 1991-batch officer, after he failed to show up for the observers training in Delhi on September 20. 

 In his reply, Roy wrote that he hadnt received the poll panels letter informing him about his nomination.

 Officials taken off the list also include Dipankar Mukhopadhyay, who was recently appointed principal secretary to the chief minister, and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation commissioner, Alapan Bandopadhyay.

 After so many names were withdrawn, more names had to be sent. The situation has become such that officers indispensable here would now have to go, said a senior official.

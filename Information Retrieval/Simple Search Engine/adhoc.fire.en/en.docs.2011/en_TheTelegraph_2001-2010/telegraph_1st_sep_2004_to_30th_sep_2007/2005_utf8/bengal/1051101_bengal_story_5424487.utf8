 Leader in jail, CPM takes guard

 Calcutta, Oct. 31: The CPM leadership today appointed Minati Ghosh, who was a minister in Jyoti Basus cabinet, secretary of the partys South Dinajpur unit.

 The decision comes a week after secretary Manabesh Chowdhury surrendered in court in connection with a slew of criminal cases and was sent to the Balurghat district jail.

 She (Minati) will function in place of Manabesh. However, this is a temporary arrangement, Anil Biswas, the state party secretary, announced this afternoon. 

 The district committee under Ghoshs leadership will meet tomorrow to assess the situation arising out of Narayan Biswass resignation. 

 Insiders said the district leadership was finding it difficult to run the organisation over the past week with party members having to drop in at the jail to discuss affairs. We have never faced such a situation before. This is the first time that a secretary has been lodged in jail, said Apurba Sen, a district committee member. Party functionaries also admitted that the 39-member district committee was handicapped in the absence of two of its most senior leaders, Manabesh and Biswas.

 The Trinamul Congress and the Congress have no representatives in the Assembly from the district, but RSP, a front partner, poses a threat to the CPM. It has three MLAs from the district, compared to the CPMs two. Relations between the two were strained further during last years civic elections in which the RSP bagged all seats in Balurghat municipality defeating CPM nominees.

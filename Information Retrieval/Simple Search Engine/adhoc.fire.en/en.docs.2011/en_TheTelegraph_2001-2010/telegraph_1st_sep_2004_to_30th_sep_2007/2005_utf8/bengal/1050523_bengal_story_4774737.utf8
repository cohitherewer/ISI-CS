 Racing on top of the world

 VIVEK CHHETRI

 Darjeeling, May 22: Cheering crowds in cloche hats have long disappeared from the galleries of the Lebong racecourse, but efforts are on to retrace the old-world charm of Darjeeling and revive one of the highest racecourses in the world.

 The favourite haunt of the towns race-goers that hosted the first Darjeeling Gymkhana Club races in 1925 shut its gates in 1984. 

 I still cherish the memories of the days when we were regulars at the racecourse. We used to trek around 8 km to reach Lebong. I hope races are resumed here soon, said Nripendra Narayan Pradhan, an old-timer. 

 The horses would race for anything between three (1,337 m) to four-and-a-half laps (2,080 m) and various trophies. Governors Cup, Burdwan Cup and Steward Cup were held here, Pradhan recollects. 

 The memories of the derby have prompted residents to work towards restoring the racecourse to its former glory and no stones are being left unturned. 

 We will form a committee and work with the Gymkhana Club to revive the racecourse, said Dawa Lama, who presided over a meeting here today. We will seek help from all quarters. 

 The land where the course is located belongs to the army, but its assets have been leased out to the Gymkhana Club. 

 We are so keen to resume races here, said Brij Mohan Garg, the vice-president of the club. Many other members of the club warmed up to the idea.

 An eight-member delegation will soon meet Subash Ghisingh, reportedly a regular at the derby and keen to revive the course. Efforts are also on to rope in the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council for financial and technical assistance. 

 Tshering Bhutia, another race regular, said: The races stopped the day Indira Gandhi was assassinated and was revived for only a season a couple of years later. 

 Non-availability of horses of good breed used to be a major problem, said Bhutia. The Manipuri breed is the best for here, but we had to make do the with local (panther) breeds.

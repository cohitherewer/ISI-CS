 Pleas ring in punches

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Calcutta, June 11: Sir, please come to our aid, they are beating us mercilessly?

 Before Satadal Mitra could complete his sentence, a constables baton landed on his head. He slumped to the ground.

 Around midnight, policemen in three jeeps swooped on students who have started a fast-unto-death on the Jadavpur University campus. 

 Around 11.30 pm, we saw the first batch of policemen armed with guns and batons getting into the jeep at Jadavpur police station. I cycled back to the university campus as fast as I could, because someone had to warn them, said Nabadit Hazra, a student of mechanical engineering.

 About half an hour later, three jeeps with policemen followed by three pick-up vans arrived on the scene, but the word had already spread and more than a hundred students had come out of their hostel rooms to join the protesters, ready to face the police.

 At 12.45, another jeep, this time carrying senior officers, reached the university. Please vacate the podium and call off your agitation. We have orders from the authorities. We are requesting you to leave immediately or else? H.K. Kusumakar, the additional superintendent of police, shouted at the top of his voice. 

 Na uthle aamra tomader tule debo (If you dont get up, we will evict you), said another police officer.

 The students refused to budge, saying the university authorities must first revoke the suspension of five seniors, punished for their role in an agitation.

 While the students stuck to their demands, another group had managed to contact university registrar Rajat Banerjee and pleaded with him to intervene. It is scary, the policemen are standing in a line, baton in hand. I presume they want to beat us up, Mitra told Banerjee on his mobile.

 Around 1.15, Kusumakar ordered his men to charge. The policemen jumped on to the makeshift podium and started breaking down the wooden platform. They grabbed my arm and also a few other students, who were fasting. They dragged me towards the van, while my friends were being beaten up, said Parag Banerjee, assistant general secretary of the Faculty of Engineering and Technology Students Union.

 Chandrasmita Choudhury, a final-year student of philosophy, was standing beside the podium when a police constable allegedly pulled her by the hair. Dont pull my hair. We have not committed any crime, where are you taking me. There are no women constables, how can the male constables touch us, she cried as the doors of the police van slammed shut on her face. The van then sped off. It was 2 in the night.

 About seven students were then taken to the M.R. Bangur Hospital. They are beating our friends, please do something. Inform the superiors, cried Arnab Das, a second year mechanical engineering student, as he ran after the police vans.

 The protestors were later brought to the Jadavpur police station before being released, some still in agony. It was like hell, said Partha Sarkar, another student.

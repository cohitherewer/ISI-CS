 ?Tutor-turned-killer? in police net 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 2: Solving algebra problems or slitting throats, he was allegedly at ease with both.

 Suman Mondal, 30, a private tutor-turned-contract killer, was in the net today after a police hunt that spanned about half-a-year.

 The science graduate has been booked for committing six murders in six months. Four of his associates are also in custody. Three others are still on the run.

 Police said Suman murdered four in July-August last year. ?In all the cases, he neatly slit the victims? throat and left no clue behind,? said S.. Gupta, the South 24-Parganas superintendent of police.

 ?He used to change his house frequently and we did not know what he looked like?So it took a while to pick him up,? Gupta added. 

 Suman, who used to run a tutorial in Bishnupur, mainly taught math. Last June, he is said to have changed vocation. An officer said: ?He formed his own gang. Apart from working as a professional killer, he used to extort money from traders in Behala and Thakurpukur.?

 The first murder was in the first week of July. ?Seven days later, we found another body in the same locality with the throat slit. Our probe drew a blank,? said the officer.

 Two of Suman?s victims were real estate developers. Their rivals had apparently hired him. The rest were members of other gangs. 

 A ?specific tip-off? about Suman?s hideout reached Bishnupur police station today. Around 2 pm, a team of officers rushed to Maheshtala on the southern fringes of the city.

 ?We did not give him a chance. It was a joint raid with officers of the Maheshtala police station. A large contingent surrounded the single-storey house where Suman was staying for the past month. A search of the rooms yielded Suman,? Gupta said. He was sleeping when caught.

 Suman?s name appeared in the police files after he committed the third murder in Falta. ?We came to know about him through our sources. Then he struck again in Thakurpukur,? said an officer. Most of Suman?s associates were known criminals. The officer added: ?Their names figured in our records and the first lead about his role came through them.?

 His modus operandi proved a giveaway for the police. ?We realised that there was one killer from the way the throats were slit,? said an officer.

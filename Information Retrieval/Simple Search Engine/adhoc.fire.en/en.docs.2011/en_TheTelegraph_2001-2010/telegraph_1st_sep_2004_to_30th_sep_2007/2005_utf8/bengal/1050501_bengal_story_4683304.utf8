 Mamata sees split-party plot

 Calcutta, April 30: Trinamul 

 Congress chairperson Mamata Banerjee today kicked off her 

 campaign for the forthcoming civic polls by accusing the 

 CPM and the Congress of hatching a ?conspiracy to break 

 my party?.

 The CPM and the Congress 

 have joined hands to finish regional parties all over the 

 country. In Bengal, our party is a victim of their conspiracy. 

 I have asked Trinamul workers not to fall into the trap 

 laid by the Congress-CPM combine, she told a mammoth 

 gathering at the Park Circus Maidan this afternoon.

 This was Mamatas first public 

 meeting after mayor Subrata Mukherjee formed the Paschimbanga 

 Unnayan Congress Mancha to mobilise anti-CPM forces, including 

 the Congress, to contest the polls.

 The Congress is unaware of the 

 dangerous consequences of hobnobbing with the Marxists, 

 she said.

 Mamata, in her 45-minute speech, 

 severely criticised the role of some party members 

 who are favouring an alliance with the Congress, but 

 did not name Mukherjee.

 The Trinamul leader said anyone could quit the party if 

 its ideology and principles were not acceptable. But 

 everyone has to accept the partys decisions and abide 

 by its constitution if he or she intends to remain in it, 

 she said.

 There is no question of 

 forming an electoral alliance with any party other than 

 the BJP. So, those advocating an alliance with the Congress 

 are going against the party line, asserted the Trinamul 

 chief.

 Some persons are trying 

 to hand over our party to another party. We are keeping 

 a close watch on them and will take action at the right 

 moment. We know all this is the CPMs handiwork, 

 she said.

 Some persons are talking 

 about a mahajot (grand alliance) with the Congress and other 

 parties. I would like to describe it as a mahaghot (grand 

 conspiracy), Mamata said.

 What is this jot? When we 

 have not quit the NDA, why should we think of any other 

 alliance? she asked. Under no circumstance shall 

 we enter into an alliance with the Congress. Come what may, 

 I shall not deviate from our political line even if I get 

 killed, said the Trinamul chief.

 On his return to Calcutta, Mukherjee 

 today discussed preparations for the May 8 Mahasammelan 

 with associates. Several Congress leaders, including defence 

 minister Pranab Mukherjee, water resources minister Priya 

 Ranjan Das Munshi and Malda MP A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury, 

 are likely to attend.

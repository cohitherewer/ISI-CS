 Calcutta, Jan. 1: The city partied through the last night of 2004 and many of the revellers kept police on their toes. 

 At the end of the big night, about 500 people were behind bars.

 They were picked up from across the city and Salt Lake and its neighbourhood.

 Peeyush Pandey, a deputy commissioner of the detective department, said: ?They were arrested for drunk driving, bursting crackers and disorderly behaviour.?

 Police officers said 346 people were arrested for disorderly conduct, which includes teasing women. From various parts of the city, 28 people were arrested for bursting banned firecrackers and 26 for driving in an inebriated condition.

 ?Most of the arrests for drunk driving were made from EM Bypass,? Pandey said.

 Elaborate police arrangements had been made in Calcutta and Salt Lake to rein in the revelry whenever required. 

 A special brigade of policemen on two-wheelers had been formed especially for last night. The force was asked to man areas adjoining hotels, clubs and thoroughfares like Park Street, Theatre Road, Ho Chi Min Sarani and Chowringhee Road. An officer said the sight of policemen on the move proves a deterrent for mischief-makers.

 Officials said radio flying squads had been deployed across the city to keep vigil. ?Reserve Police Force personnel were also brought in to assist the police force,? said an officer. 

 Top Calcutta police officers personally visited the clubs in the city to ensure that there was no trouble.

 ?The club authorities were instructed to intervene if any person was seen misbehaving. We had asked the authorities to immediately inform us if any person was trying to create trouble,? said a senior officer.

 In Salt Lake, 28 people were arrested. ?Most of them were picked up for disorderly behaviour during new year?s eve programmes at amusement parks in the township,? said Kanad Mukherjee, the Salt Lake subdivisional officer. 

 However, he added that there were ?no untoward incidents?. 

 Police seized 15 vehicles last night for travelling without proper documents. ?This was a part of our regular drive, which has been on for the past month-and-a-half,? a Bidhannagar police officer said. 

 Fifteen people were arrested from Rajarhat, 10 from Dum Dum and eight from the vicinity of Lake Town. Some of those held are said to be snatchers. 

 The southern fringes of the city were trouble free. ?We had deployed additional forces near two clubs,? said South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S. N. Gupta.

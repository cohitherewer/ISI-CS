 Crime on women

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 7: A doctor on night duty at a city hospital who treated an alleged rape victim did not have any record of the wounds she had suffered. After a case was registered, more tests followed and the one-line medical report read: ?Lice in hair.?

 With crime against women on the rise, the National Commission for Women is evolving a protocol comprising separate guidelines for police personnel, doctors, nurses and the legal aid board to deal with victims of torture and abuse. The move is meant to facilitate documentation of details of rape or torture, which help legal proceedings.

 Purnima Advani, the commission chairperson, said: ?Conviction rate in crimes against women is low as the proof collection mechanism is enormously diluted. This is because people are not clear on how to handle victims. For instance, they should be aware that in rape cases, a medical examination should be conducted within six to eight hours of the crime.?

 Advani was in the city today to outline guidelines for the protocol and attend a review meeting at Writers? Buildings.

 The guidelines relate to dealing with victims of rape and cases of dowry death and acid burns. ?The instructions will be spelt out point by point. They will be translated in the local language and put up at the mahila (women?s) desk at police stations, hospitals and health centres across the state,? she said.

 The proposed outline of the protocol for the police would involve knowing whom to contact after the crime ? namely, health department personnel and the legal aid board ? what articles to collect from the scene of the crime and what method to follow to preserve them.

 Doctors and hospital staff should keep the victim in isolation after conducting the relevant tests and should know what documents to hand over in court, the protocol suggests. 

 Advani said the same medical officer, who handled the case in the hospital, should be present in court.

Around 6,842 cases of crime against women were recorded 

in the state in 2002. The figure jumped to 8,688 in 2003 and, till November 2004, 

10,750 cases were recorded. According to the 2003 statistics, crime against women 

was more common in the two 24-Parganas, Burdwan, Murshidabad, Nadia, Jalpaiguri 

and Cooch Behar.

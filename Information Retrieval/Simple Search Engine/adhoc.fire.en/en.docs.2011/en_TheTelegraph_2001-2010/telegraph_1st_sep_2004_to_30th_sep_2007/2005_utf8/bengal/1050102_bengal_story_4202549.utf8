 Prisoners? purse for tsunami survivors

 BARUN GHOSH

 Calcutta, Jan. 1: Hatim Ali Mollah, who has been in Presidency Jail for over 13 years on the charge of murdering his wife, has become a sought-after man overnight.

 Surrounded by over 200 inmates, he kept busy preparing a list of those who have decided to contribute for the tsunami survivors.

 Over 5,000 convicts and undertrials lodged in Alipore Central Jail and Presidency Jail will forgo a month?s wages for the relief and rehabilitation of the survivors.

 ?Let us celebrate New Year?s Day this time by adopting a resolution that we shall all contribute a month?s wages for the tsunami victims, no matter how small the amount may be. The world should know that criminals, too, can rise to the occasion,? Mollah is learnt to have told a gathering of inmates.

 Subhodip Mukherjee, the social welfare officer attached to Presidency Jail, said the inmates have already petitioned superintendent S.R. Hossain urging him to allow them to contribute.

 ?Though the prisoners only earn between Rs 13 and 18 a day doing odd jobs, they are ready to contribute a month?s income,? said Mukherjee, his eyes lit up in admiration.

 ?The amount may be small. But the prisoners? gesture is fantastic,? said the deputy inspector-general of prisons, Ramapada Bhattacharya.

 In adjoining Alipore Central Jail, Arjun Jadav, Bhola Das and several other lifers campaigned through the day among other inmates to ensure their support. 

 Officials said the women inmates at the two prisons have also pledged their income for the victims.

 Calcutta, July 5: Howrah Bridge is having a bad time.

 Eleven days after a barge rammed into its belly, Howrah Bridge was plunged into darkness tonight for nearly 45 minutes after a fault developed in the CESCs feeder line supplying power to the bridge, overhead tram cables and the locality on the Calcutta side.

 CESC officials said the feeder line tripped around 8.50 pm. They said a fuse blew in a transformer located in the area on the Calcutta side of the bridge. As a result, there was also no power supply to the bridge, its approach roads and adjoining areas.

 Most of the lights came on at 9.27 pm. The fuse was repaired but power supply could only be partly restored because of a fault in the distribution cable. Our engineers are working on a war footing to repair the distribution fault, said S.S. Sinha, executive director, CESC. Around 11 pm, power supply was fully restored.

 Power was restored through alternative sources while repair of the faulty portion was still going on, Sinha said.

 Divide over doctor nod

 Calcutta, May 7: The CPMs decision to allow teaching doctors to carry out private practice has left the medical fraternity divided. 

 While veteran teachers seem happy some wonder if the step is enough to usher in reforms. ?This is a welcome move, but if you are eyeing a change, there are several other factors that should be considered,? said Gautam Mukherjee, secretary of the Association of Health Service Doctors, a pro-government doctors lobby.

 The ?other factors?, according to doctors, include increase in the budgetary allotment for the Medical Education Service. Those being inducted in the teaching cadre should participate in sessions on the latest advancements in medical sciences, they add.

 Hunger for film and fish drives two boys to suicide

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Fatal attraction: Mallika 

 Sherawat on 

 a Murder poster and a hilsa

 Krishnagar, June 13: Mallika 

 Sherawat and a slice of hilsa drove two children to suicide 

 in different corners of Nadia in the space of a few hours.

 Sudeb Majumdar, a Class VIII student, consumed rat poison in Kalyani, 50 km from Calcutta, and Sajal Roy of Class V hanged himself at Hanskhali, 30 km away.

 Sudeb was glued to a local cable channel showing the steamy Sherawat-starrer Murder around 10 last night when his elder brother stepped into the room. Bapi, a Class XII student, decreed that he should not watch the film at his age and tuned in to a sports channel. 

 A quarrel over the right to the TV set, common in homes across the country, followed. The issue then went to the parents court and Sudeb also got a thrashing there. 

 Minutes later, they heard him scream from an adjoining room. When they moved in after breaking open the door, the boy was writhing in pain. Beside him lay an empty rat poison packet.

 An officer of the Kalyani police station said: Sudeb had urged Bapi not to disturb him as the movie was reaching its climax. But Bapi was firm and told his brother that the film was not meant for children. 

 He virtually scolded his parents, Tapan and Rina. Whats going on? How could Sudeb watch such movies with you around? he asked.

 Tapan, a trader, became furious. When Sudeb talked back, he beat him up. Sudeb had marched into the other room after that.

 At Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital, he died around 6 this morning. He told us that he took his own life, said additional superintendent Biswarup Ghosh. 

 Tapan did not know how to react. While beating him, I had also drawn the attention of some of my neighbours and told them what film he had been watching. Perhaps he felt humiliated, he said.

 At Hanskhali, Jadav Roy, a farmer, brought a hilsa home last evening. Sajal and his sister Tumpa loved the fish and whooped in joy when their father walked in.

 Sajal then went to take tuition and returned around 9. As he entered the house he had the shock of his life. The slice he had chosen was on his six-year-old sisters plate.

 He threw tantrums. His mother became very angry over the meanness and Sajal refused dinner. We, too, did not eat, said Jadav.

 This morning, after repeated knocks on his door failed to elicit a response, the parents broke it open. He was hanging from the ceiling at the end of his mothers sari, said Ghosh. 

 Perhaps Sajal, too, felt humiliated, having been scolded for meanness.

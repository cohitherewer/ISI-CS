 Anglo-Indian Day

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 2: A group of schools in Calcutta, Asansol and Durgapur are joining hands to celebrate World Anglo-Indian Day on August 2. 

 This year, our theme is Saluting Anglo-Indian Education, said J.K. Sen, principal, Julien Day School, Ganganagar. 

 Sen is also the secretary of the Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools in Bengal. 

 The programme ? this is the second time the day is being marked ? will be held at the St Xaviers College auditorium and will begin with a prayer service. This will be followed by a cultural programme, said Sen. 

 There is a lot of excitement among the schools and they are thrilled to put up the show together, he said.

 The contribution of Anglo-Indians in the field of education, be it academic standards, the quality of teachers, the co-curricular activities or the overall spread of education is well known, Sen said.

 The schools left out will celebrate the day on their own. There are nearly 50 member schools and we have to keep a ceiling on the number of students we can allow, Sen said.

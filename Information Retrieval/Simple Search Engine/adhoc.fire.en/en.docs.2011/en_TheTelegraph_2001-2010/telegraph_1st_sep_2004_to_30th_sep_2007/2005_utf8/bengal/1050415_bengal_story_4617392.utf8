 Hotel ERS deadline 

 Calcutta, April 14: The government will decide on Monday whether to extend the Great Eastern Hotel employees? deadline for picking up early retirement scheme forms.

 Tourism minister Dinesh Dakua said: ?We might consider giving the workers another chance and extend the deadline, but the extension will not be for more than a week.? 

 The minister, who had earlier said the 165-year-old hotel would ?die a natural death? if the staff refuse to retire, today said: ?We are consulting the Industrial Disputes Act to figure out the modalities of the closure.? He also ruled out any further talks with the unions. So far, 10 employees out of over 400 have sought the forms.

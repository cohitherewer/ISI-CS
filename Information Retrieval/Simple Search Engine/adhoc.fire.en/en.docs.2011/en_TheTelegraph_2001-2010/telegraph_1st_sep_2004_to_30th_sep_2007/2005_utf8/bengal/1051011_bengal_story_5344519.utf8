 College autonomy by year-end

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, Oct. 10: The pro- cess of granting autonomous status to undergraduate colleges will start by the end of this year, the government said today.

 We have directed the universities across Bengal to take proper initiative to award autonomous status to at least some undergraduate colleges by December 31, higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty said. 

 He conveyed the decision to Calcutta University vice- chancellor Asis Kumar Banerjee and senior varsity officials at a meeting last week. 

 The university has the most number of affiliated colleges ? about 160 ? in the state. 

 One of those present at the meeting said, the decision came after a recent, and firm, get-moving missive to the government from the University Grants Commission (UGC). 

 The UGC had asked the education department to complete the process of granting autonomy to undergraduate colleges by the end of March 2006. 

 We had repeatedly requested the Bengal government to finalise its stand on the autonomy issue in the past few years. The last one was a further reminder to the government to give its opinion as quick as possible. Most other states have already implemented the decision, said V.N. Rajasekharan Pillai, the UGCs acting chairman.

 The UGC had first sent its proposal on college autonomy to the government in 1986. After opposing the proposal for nearly two decades, the Left Front government agreed in principle to allow the independence in 2003. 

 Calcutta University is working overtime to ensure that colleges having the right infrastructure get the status by this December, said Shyamapada Pal, a member of the West Bengal Higher Education Council and the Calcutta University syndicate.

 The government has asked all state-aided universities, which have over 300 colleges affiliated to them, to work out the process. 

 The government was initially reluctant to accept the autonomy proposal because it was opposed to some of the conditions that were laid down by the UGC. 

 We decided otherwise after the UGC agreed to introduce certain changes in the conditions, Pal said.

 In the original proposal, the universities would have had no control over the academic activities of colleges after they were given the autonomy. 

 Now the UGC has agreed to allow the universities to have authority over the colleges in certain matters relating to academics. For example, the universities would be able to conduct inspections and run regular checks on students performances even after institutions become independent.

 The original proposal did not also clarify the governments role regarding colleges that were entirely state-funded. Government sources said the UGC has cleared its doubts.

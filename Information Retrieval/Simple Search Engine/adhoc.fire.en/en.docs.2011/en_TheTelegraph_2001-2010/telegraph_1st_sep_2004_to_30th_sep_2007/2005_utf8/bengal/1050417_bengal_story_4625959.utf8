 Patient falls and bleeds to death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 16: A 58-year-old man fell on his way to the toilet at the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital last night and bled to death. 

 The staff on duty were nowhere in sight as Bikash Ghosh, a diabetes patient, lay in a pool of blood.

 The incident comes a few days after lack of vigil at SSKM hospital allowed a patient to walk out. Mohammad Mustafa?s daughter Nuzhat Parveen said that when asked how her father had slipped out, the nurses on duty could not give a satisfactory answer. 

 Police said Ghosh died around 10 last night. An unnatural death case was registered with Bowbazar police and the body was sent for post-mortem today.

 ?Bikash Ghosh? from Lake Gardens was admitted to the hospital last week. He was under treatment in the medicine ward and was supposed to be released soon after treatment,? a police officer said.

 The hospital?s deputy superintendent, Amarendra Biswas, said: ?We have initiated an inquiry.... If anyone is found to have been negligent and responsible for the death? action will be taken against him or her.?

 A hospital official said Ghosh got up last night to go to the toilet. ?After taking a few steps, he slumped on the floor. None of the other patients in the same room noticed as they were sleeping.?

 Ghosh was found lying near the toilet door. ?We found a deep wound on his head. He probably hit the corner of a bed as he fell. Blood was oozing from the wound. Immediately after noticing him, we called the doctor who pronounced him dead,? said the official. 

 ?The deceased?s wife Geeta Ghosh was informed on Saturday morning,? he added.

 With the government banning ayahs inside state-run-hospitals, relatives have to keep vigil near patients? beds. But on several occasions, patients have fallen off their beds and hurt themselves. 

 ?There is a shortage of nursing staff and, in this case, we have to find out whether there were family members near the patient?s bed. We will get to the bottom of the case,? said Biswas.

 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, Feb. 8: Milan Bagchi, a CPM supporter, was arrested today for allegedly raping a 17-year-old maid at Thanerpara in Nadia. 

 The girl?s mother, Shuru Bewa, had complained to police that not only was her daughter raped, she was also forced to undergo abortion. Local CPM leaders had tried to hush up the charge and broker a settlement, but the police stepped in. The party?s Karimpur MLA, Prafulla Bhowmik, said Milan ?wanted to compensate in terms of money?. The police ruled out any ?settlement?. 

 Barasat (PTI): A five-year-old boy missing since Sunday was found dead in a pond in North 24-Parganas? Basirhat on Tuesday. Police did not rule out murder.

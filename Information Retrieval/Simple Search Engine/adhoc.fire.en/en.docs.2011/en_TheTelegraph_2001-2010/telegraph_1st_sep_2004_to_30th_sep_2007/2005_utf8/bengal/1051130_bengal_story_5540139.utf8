 Adhir wife secures bail

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 29: Adhir Chowdhurys wife Arpita got anticipatory bail from the high court today. 

 An arrest warrant was issued against her along with her husband, the Behrampore MP, in connection with the murders of Hanif Sheikh and his son Laltoo on July 23. 

 Chowdhury, picked up from his Delhi residence on November 19, was denied bail and remanded in jail custody.

 Arpita moved the division bench of Justices D.P. Sengupta and S.K. Gupta after a sess- ions court in Behrampore refused to stay the warrant issued against her by the Behrampore chief judicial magistrate. 

 Police had involved Arpita in the murder case on the basis of information that she had made several phone calls to her husband and Tapan Basu, another accused in the case, before and after the double murders. 

 But the police failed to produce any proof that these calls were made in connection with the murders. This prompted the high court to grant her prayer, said Arpitas lawyer Jaymalya Bagchi.

 The police involved her in the murder case only to harass her, the lawyers pleaded. 

 Asked whether todays order would clear the MPs way to obtain bail, a senior lawyer said: The charges against him are different in nature.

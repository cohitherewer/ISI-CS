 Trial-II for doctor death accused

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 26: The high court today set aside an order of the Howrah district and sessions judge that acquitted four persons accused in the murder of Dr Sushil Pal in July last year.

 After todays order, Biswanath Kangshabanik, Rajib Nath, Krishna Sadhukhan and Jayanta Ghosh will have to face trial in the sessions judges court. They were also told to be present in the sessions judges court during the trial.

 Justice S.K. Guptas order followed a plea by the government seeking cancellation of the order of the district judge who acquitted the quartet after Kangshabanik turned approver in the case and made a statement before a magistrate.

 Appearing for the state, Swapan Mallik and Saswata Gopal Mukherjee submitted that Kangshabanik had said in his statement that he and the other three were involved in the conspiracy to murder Pal. 

 The court cannot discharge an accused who himself is admitting that he was involved in the crime. Kangshabanik and the others have said that they did the job on the advice of others, the lawyers said.

 Pals body, which bore multiple injuries, was found in a canal at Bally in Hooghly on July 2 last year. The doctor had left his home on Broad Street for Serampore Walsh Hospital the previous day. A CID investigation found that he was killed for allegedly refusing to carry out an abortion.

 Thirteen people, including Dr Piyali Das Mondal and Biswajyoti Basu, the owner of a nursing home at Bally in Howrah were arrested in connection with the murder. The trial court has framed charges against nine of them.

 Hooch toll

 Five people have died at Kadak village in East Midnapore after consuming spurious liquor. 

 Police said the dead were among over 50 masons engaged in the construction of a school building, about 175 km from Calcutta. They drank after work last night.

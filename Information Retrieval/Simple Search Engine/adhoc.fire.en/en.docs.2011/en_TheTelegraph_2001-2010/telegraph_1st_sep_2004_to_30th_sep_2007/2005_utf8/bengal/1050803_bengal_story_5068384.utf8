 Teacher hand cut amp; caught

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Aug. 2: The hand of a teacher was chopped off and tossed around and one of his eyes gouged out when he was on his way to school this morning through a deserted village road.

 Mainuddin Sarkar, a popular math teacher, was possibly attacked because he was also a CPM leader and panchayat member at Moktarpur village in Islampur, about 245 km from Calcutta. 

 With horror I watched them play with my arm. Before fleeing, one of them swiftly took out a knife and thrust it in my right eye, Sarkar said from his hospital bed this evening, his right arm missing from below the elbow.

 The CPM blamed Congress-backed miscreants for the gruesome attack on one of its most popular leaders.

 Murshidabad superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh said the attack on Sarkar was for political reasons. 

 Mainuddin Sarkar has identified most of the attackers and we have recorded his statement. A search for the culprits is on, he added.

 Iqbal Hossain, a member of the CPMs Islampur zonal committee, charged district Congress leader Mousumi Begum with instigating Congress workers against Sarkar. Yesterday she delivered a fiery speech against the CPM and accused our party of influencing the police to bring false charges against Congress workers. So, her partymen started baying for the blood of some prominent CPM leaders, he said.

 He was angry that the police had failed to make a single arrest till late night. We will wait for a couple of days. If the police are unable to arrest the culprits, we will launch an agitation?. Hossain said.

 The Congress leader, Mou-sumi Begum, denied having made a speech that could provoke her party workers. 

 We condemn the attack on Mainuddin Sarkar and we want to state clearly that the Congress was in no way linked with it, she said.

 The police said Sarkar went to the Islampur police station riding his motorcycle this morning to sort out a local problem. Around 10 am, he was heading to Ranitala High School through Moktarpur village when over a dozen goons accosted him. They blocked his way and hurled a bomb. 

 Sarkar fell to the ground with his motorcycle. With a meat chopper, the attackers severed his arm and threw it in the air and caught it on its way down. 

 The CPM leader was also hit in his leg and head with daggers. Then his right eye bore the brunt. He said: They wanted to intimidate us. That is why they played around with my severed limb.

 Plans with eye on UK

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, May 21: The cashstarved social welfare and women and child development department is making grand plans and banking on the British funding agency, Department for International Development (DFID), to see them through.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government last week held discussions on funds from the DFID for social welfare plans, including nutrition for adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating mothers and children. It is awaiting DFIDs response. 

 Social welfare and women and child development secretary S.N. Haque today said the government intends to include more beneficiaries in several of its ongoing projects as well as to improve some other schemes. 

 We have had a few rounds of discussions on funds for several projects which need to be improved, he said.

 For one, the state wants to broaden the perspective of the National Programme for Adolescent Girls, a central government scheme.

 Another project to be implemented is the development of anganwadi centres. 

 The state government also intends to extend the Micro-nutrient Initiative Project to all districts. Under the scheme, nutrition is provided through atta, candy and khichuri. 

 The government has not sought any specific amount from DFID. We are focusing on the projects and their needs. The discussion on the fund element comes later, Haque said.

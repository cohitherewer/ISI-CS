 Cloud on hill elections

 OUR BUREAU

 Feb. 3: The GNLF today struck back with its no-election cry, throwing the fate of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council into another round of uncertainty that till yesterday seemed to have ebbed away. 

 The announcement comes even as Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee prepares for his second visit to Siliguri in less than a month to preside over a crucial CPM Darjeeling secretariat meeting on February 14 where he is supposed to formulate the party?s ?final strategy? for the elections. 

 Deepak Gurung, the GNLF Darjeeling branch committee president, today said in Darjeeling: ?An alternative to the council has to be worked out before the elections are held. This was always the party?s stand and it still is.?

 GNLF chief Subash Ghisingh had earlier maintained that the DGHC elections were not possible till an alternative to the council was worked out. But after a review meeting in Delhi, the GNLF leader seemed to have softened his stand. 

 The government had said it was firm on going ahead with the polls and not ?bowing? to Ghisingh.

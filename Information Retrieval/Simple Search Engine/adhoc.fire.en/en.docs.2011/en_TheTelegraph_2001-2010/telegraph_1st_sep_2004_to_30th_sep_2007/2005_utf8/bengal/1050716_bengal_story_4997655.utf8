 Madhyamik, half the bulk

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 15: Like the HS examination, Madhyamik, too, is likely to become less taxing for students. 

 The board of secondary education is planning to carve up the course and conduct the final examination only on the Class X syllabus. 

 Under the existing system, the final examination is held on the syllabi for classes IX and X. 

 At a meeting with representatives of 16 teachers associations today, the board sought their opinion on the split. 

 It has become necessary to make the examination system less stressful for students, particularly when examination-related suicides are increasing every year, board president Dibyendu Hota said. We will prepare a report on the outcome of todays meeting and submit it to the government as early as possible so that it can finalise its stand soon. The board will take a final decision on the syllabus split after getting the governments clearance.

 School education minister Kanti Biswas announced in the Assembly last week the decision to hold the higher secondary examination on the Class XII syllabus. 

 The government is keen on holding the Madhyamik and HS exams on the basis of Class X and XII syllabi as the Delhi-based boards that conduct the ICSE, ISC and CBSE examinations have already introduced the system.

 The necessity to split the school-leaving examinations was felt during a recent meeting of the heads of education boards of the country.

 Hota, however, said a number of factors have to be taken into consideration before finalising the decision. The move would require a thorough restructuring of the syllabi. In addition, steps have to be taken to ensure that the schools have the infrastructure to conduct proper promotion tests at the end of Class IX.

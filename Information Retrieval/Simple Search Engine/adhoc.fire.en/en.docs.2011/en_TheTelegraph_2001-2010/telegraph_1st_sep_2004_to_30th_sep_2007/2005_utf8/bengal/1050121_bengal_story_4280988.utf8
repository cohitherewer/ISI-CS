 Rebel MP mulling return

 OUR BUREAU

 Jan. 20: Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury, who had quit as the party?s Murshidabad chief, today appeared to have softened up following phone calls from Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and Somen Mitra.

 Former state party chief Mitra, who had been in the Behrampore MP?s firing line, said: ?Adhir promised to reconsider his decision when I requested him to withdraw the resignation for the sake of our organisation.? He was at Bishnupur in Bankura for a party programme.

 Chowdhury resigned on Tuesday after being criticised for pointing fingers at Mitra and other state Congress leaders for rifts within the party at a rally on January 11, addressed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh among others. 

 Now camping in Behrampore, Chowdhury told reporters he had received calls from Das Munshi, the Union water resources minister and Raiganj MP, and Mitra, requesting him to withdraw the resignation. 

 He added that Pranab Mukherjee, the state party president and defence minister, also called him yesterday. ?I regard Pranabda as my guardian. So, I do not know how long I shall be able to stick to my stand. But I am not opposed to a new district Congress leader,? he said.

 Leaders from Jangipur, Mukherjee?s Lok Sabha constituency, were confident about Chowdhury taking back his resignation. ?Pranabda has told us not to worry about it. He will pursue Chowdhury to withdraw when he meets him at Behrampore on Friday,? said one of them.

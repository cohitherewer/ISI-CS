 Landmine blast plotters arrested

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, June 17: A day after detaining them, the CID arrested Dipanjan Mukherjee, Kanika Debnath and Sabyasachi Goswami for their alleged involvement in a landmine blast in Purulia.

 The trio was picked up from Behala yesterday on charges of waging a war against the nation, attempted murder and illegal possession of arms. They were sent to Purulia today for production in court.

 On October 11, 2003, a landmine exploded under a jeep carrying policemen into the Kantabora forest. Nilmadhab Das, the officer-in-charge of the Bandwan police station, was killed in a shootout with extremists hiding in the forest that followed. 

 The police today claimed that the trio was not present at the shootout site but had been involved in plotting the attack. They had even allegedly arranged the explosives.

 A resident of Ramakanta Sen lane in Ultadanga, Dipanjan alias Bhutai was earlier arrested on April 30, 2000. He was caught carrying 40 gelatine sticks on Poorva Express, but as the police failed to submit a timely chargesheet, he slipped out on bail.

 Dipanjan is said to be an active member of the CPI (Maoist) who holds a senior position in the party hierarchy.

 Kanika alias Soma is from Jorabagan. We have seized photographs that suggest she is an active CPI (Maoist) member, said Rajeev Kumar, the CID deputy inspector-general.

 Sabyasachi is from Agarpara on the northern fringes of the city. When the chargesheet in connection with the explo- sive haul was submitted, he was shown as absconding. 

 A pass graduate from City College, Amherst Street, police said, he was a delegate to the meeting where the Peoples War merged with the Maoist Communist Centre to form the CPI (Maoist). 

 Heist same-side

 Chitta Debnath, a petrol pump owner in Nadias Haringhata, was arrested today on charges of staging a dacoity in his outlet to claim insurance. 

 He had lodged a police complaint saying that a gang looted his pump on Sunday. The police had earlier arrested the pump manager, who was said to have been injured in the heist. Nadia police chief R. Rajsekharan said Debnath had hired people for the looting.

 Party breather for Narayan

 - Tale of two fugitives: Minister at large; boy pays for father

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 29: The CPM today indicated that fugitive minister Narayan Biswas is unlikely to surrender before his anticipatory bail plea is heard by the high court, which reopens on November 7.

 A meeting attended by Biswas, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas, housing minister Gautam Deb and other party leaders apparently decided on the course of action. 

 Narayan Biswas came here from Balurghat today but stayed away from the public eye. He could not be contacted.

 Biswas is wanted in connection with a rioting case and has been accused of murder at Gangarampur in South Dinajpur.

 The partys legal cell is learnt to have suggested that the minister should not surrender as he has prayed for anticipatory bail, CPM sources said.

 Although chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wants his cabinet colleague to surrender without delay, members of the legal cell said he should wait for the high courts ruling. We have asked the minister not to surrender on his own and instead wait for the high courts order, said a party functionary.

 Alimuddin Street also advised the minister not to use government vehicles allotted to him and avoid interacting with people and the media during his stay here. CPM insiders said the party would ask the minister to resign if his bail plea is turned down.

 A visit to the ministers Minto Park flat revealed he was not there. 

 You may find Biswas at the state party office or at Gautam Debs house. As far as I know, he has gone to Debs house, said Apurba Sen, a district committee member of the CPMs South Dinajpur unit, who accompanied the minister to Calcutta.

 It is learnt that the minister will return to Balurghat to attend a meeting planned by the district Left Front on November 5 with supporters shaken after CPM district secretary Manabesh Chowdhury was remanded in jail custody in connection with criminal cases.

 Murshidabad district judge today rejected the bail petition by Congress MP from Behrampore Adhir Chowdhurys wife Arpita. Police had issued a warrant against the couple on October 18.

 Congress leaders said they will decide the course of action regarding the party MP and his wife after knowing about the CPMs decision on the Narayan Biswas episode.

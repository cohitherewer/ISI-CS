 School faces probe over timing

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Feb. 4: A higher secondary school in Nadia has altered its timings so that its Class V students are not served mid-day meals in the presence of seniors, who were feeling left out.

 An official of Khalboalia Higher Secondary School at Krishnagunj, about 110 km from Calcutta, said it ?looks odd? to serve the 350-odd Class V students cooked meal in front of others. 

 But the rare sensitivity ? triggered to an extent by compulsions ? has landed the school in trouble. The district school education authorities today asked the inspector of schools (primary) to inquire into what it called an ?illegal? step. 

 The school with a strength of about 1,200 boys and girls starts from Class V. According to the scheme for primary students, only the junior-most class is entitled to the meals in this case. 

 ?A school cannot shift a class to morning hours on its own? It is absolutely illegal. I have asked the district inspector of schools to carry out a probe and submit a report,? said Bibhas Biswas, the chairman of the Nadia primary school council. 

 The authorities of the Krishnagunj institution, however, see nothing wrong in asking the Class V students to attend class from 7 am instead of 11. ?It simply does not look nice to serve food to a set of students when the others do not get it,? said an official.

 But the decision sparked resentment. The permanent teachers refused to adjust their timings. The authorities then shifted seven teachers who had been hired on contract to the morning section. 

 ?Students of the higher classes told us about their reservations regarding the meals being served only to Class V. There were space problems, too,? said headmaster Samarjit Biswas. 

 The parents are not happy either. One of them said it is unfair to force Class V students to come to school by 7, especially in winter. ?Now they are only attending classes for three hours. Earlier it was five. We have complained to the headmaster,? said Sadhan Singha Roy, the father of Suchitra, who travels 10 km to school.

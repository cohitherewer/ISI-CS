 Tolly police batter tea stall protester 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Jan. 15: Tarun Ghosh, a homeopath, and his brother Indrajit were manhandled in Tollygunge police station this morning for articulating a neighbourhood demand for removal of an illegal tea stall. 

 Residents say the shop, on the footpath outside the police station, has turned into a hub of anti-social activities in the S.P. Mukherjee Road-Pratapaditya Road-Southern Avenue belt. 

 It was initially located on the premises of the police station and the owner supplied endless cups of free tea to the cops in return for their ?patronage?. Last week, the stall was relocated outside after complaints reached Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner (south). 

 ?The tea stall has become the meeting point of anti-socials and cops for payment of hafta,? said a resident, who did not wanted to be named. ?We had demanded demolition of the shop,? he added. 

 Ghosh had earlier lodged a complaint at the police station against the tea stall as smoke from it was damaging expensive medicines in his shop. Still, the police, led by sub-inspector P.K. Dey Roy, shifted it nearer to Ghosh?s store on S.P. Mukherjee Road last week. 

 ?I protested again as the medicines were getting damaged. Moreover, no one can set up an illegal stall on the footpath,? said Ghosh. ?However, I had to face several threats after I lodged the complaint.? 

 This morning, Ghosh was summoned to the police station by Dey Roy and detained. The sub-inspector also asked the tea-stall owner?s wife to come. 

 ?When she came to the police station, she was forced to lodge a complaint alleging that I had tortured her mentally and physically,? Ghosh said. 

 The policeman also asked the tea-stall owner to lodge another complaint, stating that articles of his shop were damaged by the doctor. 

 Ghosh?s brother, who was resting at home on doctor?s advice, was also brought to the police station and the siblings were beaten up. 

 On learning about the incident, officer-in-charge K.K. Patra called up Dey Roy and asked him to release them immediately. 

 However, when Ghosh went to submit a letter to him with a full description of the events, Patra refused to accept it. ?I have sent him the letter by registered post,? Ghosh said. Copies have been sent to the State Human Rights? Commission, police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and Anuj Sharma. 

 When contacted, Patra said: ?This is an unfortunate incident. Though the allegation is against a police official for beating up the doctor?s brother, it should be settled amicably.? 

 Ghosh said it was the police?s duty to remove illegal stalls from footpaths. ?But here, the police is helping a person to set up a illegal stall on the footpath,? he said.

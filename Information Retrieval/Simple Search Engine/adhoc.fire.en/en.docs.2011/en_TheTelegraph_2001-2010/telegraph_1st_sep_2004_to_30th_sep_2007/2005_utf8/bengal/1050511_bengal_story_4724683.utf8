 Strike traders soft on VAT

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 10: After closing down markets for 10 days in April, traders bodies earlier demanding withdrawal of value-added tax met Asim Dasgupta today to discuss procedures for its implementation, signalling an acceptance of VAT.

 The Federation of Traders Organisation that had threatened agitation till VAT was withdrawn urged the finance minister to constitute a ?broad base? committee to look into the loopholes and simplify the implementation.

 After the meeting, Dasgupta said: ?Our stand on VAT remains the same. However, we are always willing to hold discussions on the simplification of implementation.? Another traders body is scheduled to meet the minister tomorrow. 

 Tarak Nath Trivedi, a representative of todays delegation, said: ?The finance minister assured us that he would constitute a committee and give us a hearing in June.?

 Bharatiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal, the apex body of traders, had shut down wholesale trade from April 20 to 28 and the retail markets on April 29. Thousands under the banner of the Federation of Traders Organisation of West Bengal had downed shutters.

 Today, the federation said it was concerned about small traders. ?We want representation in the committee starting from the district level. It should have at least 50 members. We want to discuss the problems in the implementation of the tax, especially because there is no uniformity on VAT in all the states,? Trivedi said.

 Dasgupta said he would expand the existing committee. Even abroad, there was an initial opposition to VAT, he told reporters later. 

 A delegation of the Indian Newspaper Society also met him requesting the abolition of VAT on newsprint. 

 The team included Aniruddha Lahiri, the managing director of ABP, Rajiv Verma, the executive president of Hindustan Times, N. Murali, the joint managing director of The Hindu, Mammen Mathew, the editor and managing director of Malayalam Manorama and Shakti Dasgupta, the managing editor of Bartaman. 

 Dasgupta said he would discuss the demand with the empowered committee of finance ministers, which he chairs.

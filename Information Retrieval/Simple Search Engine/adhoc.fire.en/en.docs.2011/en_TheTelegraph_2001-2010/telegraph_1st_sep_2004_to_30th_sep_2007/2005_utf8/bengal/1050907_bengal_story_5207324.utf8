 BRIEFS

 Burdwan, Sept. 6: Two persons, including a 14-year-old boy, have died at the Katwa sub-divisional hospital here in the last five days after they were diagnosed as suffering from Japanese Encephalitis. The disease has claimed over 400 lives in Uttar Pradesh since it broke out early last month. 

 Additional chief medical officer Madhav Chattopadhaya said blood samples are being collected from nearly 100 people who were admitted to the hospital last week. 

 Calcutta: RSP member Bachhu Sardar, notorious for looting boats in the Sunderbans, has been arrested from Jharkhali. Police said he has been evading arrest since December last year. A red-faced RSP feigned ignorance about Sardars involvement in criminal activities. Some party workers alleged that Sardar has fallen prey to a conspiracy hatched by the CPM. 

 Suri: Birbhum Mahavidyalaya here, about 230 km from Calcutta, was declared closed on Tuesday for an indefinite period following clashes among students belonging to the SFI and Chhatra Parishad over teachers day celebrations.

 Krishnagar: Sajal Bhattacharya, the CPM gram panchayat pradhan at Santipur, about 70 km from Calcutta, has surrendered before a Ranaghat court after an arrest warrant was issued against him in connection with the murder of CPI activist Ajit Ghosh in July, 1998. 

 Calcutta: The government has directed the superintendents of 54 jails across the state to prepare a list of life-term convicts who have completed 14 years of their sentence. The move follows an appeal, filed on behalf of convicts, to the Supreme Court to release them.

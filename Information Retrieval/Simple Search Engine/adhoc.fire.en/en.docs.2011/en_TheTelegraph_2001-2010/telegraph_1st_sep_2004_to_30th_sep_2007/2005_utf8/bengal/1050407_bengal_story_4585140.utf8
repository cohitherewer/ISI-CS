 Wait for justice

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, April 6: A 16-year-old made a heroic escape from the clutches of her rapists, but justice eludes her.

 The teenager, who jumped off a running train in which she was being taken to Uttar Pradesh to be sold for Rs 55,000 after being raped in November last year, has been doing the rounds of the police station for months. 

 She had lodged a complaint against her abductor, Sader Sheikh, a resident of the neighbouring Sripatipur village. Her medical test reports confirmed she was raped. But the FIR is gathering dust and Sader is yet to be arrested.

 A gun-toting gang would regularly barge into her home at Beniakhali village in Murshidabad district?s Domkol area, 230 km from Calcutta, and threaten her to withdraw the complaint. 

 ?Every time we visit Domkol police station to meet the investigating officer, Abul Kasem, he behaves rudely. He told us that he does not run a zamindari that he can sell and set off to arrest the accused,? said the girl?s mother, Safia Bibi. 

 Safia and her daughter met district superintendent of police Sanjay Singh yesterday and submitted a written complaint, giving details of the abduction and Kasem?s harassment.

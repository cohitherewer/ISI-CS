 Call to lower cut-off for campus jobs 

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, Sept. 26: When the IITs are firm on shutting their doors on students scoring less than 60 per cent in the Plus II examinations, the West Bengal University of Technology is working on a move in the opposite direction for engineering graduates from private colleges. 

 It wants to convince top recruiters, many of who fix a cut-off of 60 per cent all through academic career for final-year students to appear in campus interviews, to lower their benchmark. 

 According to the criteria fixed by companies like TCS, Cognizant, Wipro or Infosys, students completing their bachelor of engineering (BE) courses from private colleges are required to score a minimum of 60 per cent marks in their Class X, Class XII and graduation examinations.

 After making a verbal appeal during a meeting with representatives of seven big companies last week, vice-chancellor Ashoke Thakur, has now requested the companies in writing to consider the petition.

 Government officials said the chief ministers secretariat has reportedly directed the university to initiate such a move after receiving a series of complaints from students of private engineering colleges. 

 Their letters had apparently pointed out that deserving candidates were being denied employment in big companies because of the high cut-off marks. 

 After examining the students complaints, we found that many deserving students unnecessarily miss an opportunity to appear in the campus interviews of big companies because of their eligibility criteria, Thakur said. 

 We have requested all the companies to give their opinion on whether they are willing to lower the criteria considering the interest of students, he added.

 The top firms were not willing to comment on their recruitment policies. Middle-level and lower companies fix no marks bar for campus interviews.

 Thakur pointed out that his move had nothing to do with the IITs decision to fix an admission cut-off of 60 per cent in the Plus II exam. The university had begun talking to the companies much before that.

 Many meritorious students narrowly miss a first division in the Plus II examination, but perform extremely well in their graduation. These students should not be deprived the opportunity to appear in the campus interviews, said the universitys placement officer, Indrakanta Moitra.

 Letters from students demanding that big companies reduce their eligibility criteria have also come to the university. Why shouldnt we get a chance to appear for the interviews if we perform well in the BE and BTech exams, asked Bikash Mondal, a student of a private college in south Calcutta.

 Thakur said the companies will send their opinions soon, after which the technology university will decide its course of action.

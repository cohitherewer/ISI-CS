 Calcutta, May 14: Come September, the city will have its first fertility clinic with international collaboration. 

 Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre today signed an agreement with Herzilya Medical Centre (HMC) of Israel to set up the clinic. 

 Madhu Neotia, the director of the woman and child care centre, and Aubrey Joffe, the director of HMC, signed the dotted line in the presence of David Danieli, the Israeli ambassador to India. 

 The centre will allot an entire floor to the clinic. It will initially spend Rs 2 crore to set up Genomee ?

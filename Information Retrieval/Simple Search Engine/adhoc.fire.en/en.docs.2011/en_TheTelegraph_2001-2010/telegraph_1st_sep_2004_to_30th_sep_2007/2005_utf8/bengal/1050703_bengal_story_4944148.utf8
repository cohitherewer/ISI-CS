 Silver lining for lake settlers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 2: With the railway authorities refusing to provide land to settlers along Rabindra Sarobar, the state government has drafted a rehabilitation package for them under the Valmiki Ambedkar Malin Bustee Awas Yojana (Vambay).

 Calcutta High Court today directed the railway authorities to clarify within a fortnight their stand on rehabilitating settlers along the train track from Ballygunj to Tollygunj. 

 The railway had earlier expressed its inability to provide land despite minister Laloo Prasad Yadavs assurance to the contrary.

 The political heat is also building up with Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee deciding to hold a rally at Gobindapur near Rabindra Sarobar on Monday. 

 Officials of the urban development department have identified some areas in Baruipur, Dankuni, Kalyani and Howrah, where new townships are coming up, to build a cluster of houses for the settlers.

 It is the railways responsibility to provide land to the settlers as they are occupying its land. Most of them have encroached on railway land and cannot legally claim rehabilitation. However, we are in favour of their rehabilitation on humanitarian grounds. If the railway does not provide land, we will take the initiative to offer them alternative dwelling units. As we do not have any large chunk of land to accommodate all the settlers, we have selected separate areas to build housing complexes for them, said a senior officer.

 He described Vambay as a Centre-sponsored housing scheme for poor people. Under the scheme, the state government will build houses ? each costing Rs 50,000 to 60,000 ? on its land. The Centre will bear 50 per cent of cost and the rest will be shared by the state government and the beneficiary. 

 A beneficiary will have to pay an amount ranging from Rs 10,000 to Rs 20,000, depending on the building cost, said A.K. Ganai, the Calcutta Improvement Trusts (CIT) officer on special duty.

 The settlers, Ganai added, will be given the option of paying in easy instalments or taking bank loans with the governments help. Our scheme is ready and we intend to go ahead with it on the basis of the high courts order.

 The government has implemented a similar scheme at Baishnabghata-Patuli, where settlers along the Tollys nullah found homes.

 There are about 700 settlers in the stretch between Ballygunge and Tollygunge. The CIT and police will finalise the list of names after conducting a survey.

 BRIEFS

 Durgapur, June 12: Six Central Industrial Security Force personnel, including a sub-inspector, were arrested last night for allegedly smuggling coal and nut coke from the Durgapur Steel Plant. 

 Police said they were on duty at the plants gate No. 2. Tenjit Ansari, who allegedly dealt in stolen coal and coke, and Sheikh Murtoja, a truck driver, were also held. Superintendent N.K. Singh said the police had been getting tip-offs that materials from DSP ? iron slabs, slag, coal and coke ? were being pilfered in connivance with a section of the CISF, the central security agency that guards DSP. 

 Chinsurah: Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya, the secretary of the CPM youth wing, DYFI, in Konnagar, committed suicide on Sunday. Wanted in a case in which a man was beaten to death in April, Bhattacharya, 31, was absconding. His wife Rupa alleged that police were torturing him mentally. Hooghly superintendent Supratim Sarkar said the police often raided the leaders house looking for him.

 Calcutta: Pratima Dandapat, 22, a housewife, was allegedly burnt to death by her husband at Namkhana. Police said he tortured her since marriage, a year ago. Neighbours saw smoke billowing from her room and heard her scream on Sunday afternoon. They took Pratima to a hospital, where she died. The husband has fled.

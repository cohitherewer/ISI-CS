 Blood blunder kills woman

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, May 30: A nursing 

 home in Jhargram turned into a battleground when a woman 

 died after being administered blood of the wrong group.

 A mob went on the rampage at the nursing home this afternoon, hours after 23-year-old Kabita Patra, who had delivered a baby last night, passed away.

 Kabita started bleeding profusely after the delivery and was given a pouch of B-negative blood, which was not enough. But as the blood bank at the Jhargram subdivisional hospital had run out of B-negative blood, Gourmohan Jena, the doctor attending to Kabita, requisitioned B-positive blood for her.

 Kabitas husband Atanu got two pouches of B-positive blood and it was injected into her body. Her situation deteriorated soon after and she died early this morning.

 Police have arrested Jena on the charge of negligence and put the nursing home under lock and key. All patients, including Kabitas newborn, have been shifted to the Jhargram subdivisional hospital.

 All political parties have jointly called a 24-hour bandh in the Jhargram subdivision tomorrow.

 During her pregnancy, Kabita had been staying with her parents in Jhargram town in West Midnapore district, 170 km from Calcutta, the police said. 

 Yesterday, she went into labour and her husband took her to the nursing home where she gave birth to a girl. 

 As news of her death spread, hundreds of angry residents gathered at the nursing home and smashed windowpanes and furniture with brickbats and stones. Some blocked the roads near the nursing home. 

 When the police arrived, the mob pelted stones at them.

 District superintendent of police Ajay Nanda said the police dispersed the protesters with lathis and arrested the doctor on the basis of Atanus complaint. 

 Speaking to reporters from the lock-up in Jhargram police station, Jena pleaded innocence. He said he had tried his best to save Kabita. I was forced to give blood of a different group to my patient because B-negative blood was not available. I had also advised the patient party to shift the patient to the subdivisional hospital.

 However, Atanu countered Jenas claim. The doctor asked us to shift the patient at the last moment. Before that, he continued to assure us that my wife would be alright.

 Chief medical officer of West Midnapore Mangobinda Mondal said: In this case, the patient had lost a lot of blood and there had not been an all-out effort to save her. After preliminary inquiries, we have found that excessive bleeding led to the patients death.

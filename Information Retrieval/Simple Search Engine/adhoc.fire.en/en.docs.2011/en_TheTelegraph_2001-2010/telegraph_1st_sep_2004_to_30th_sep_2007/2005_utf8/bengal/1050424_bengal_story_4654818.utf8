 Mayor ?cat out of bag?

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 At odds: Mamata and Subrata 

 Calcutta, April 23: The Trinamul Congress leadership has started its search for a new mayoral candidate for the June 19 Calcutta Municipal Corporation polls after mayor Subrata Mukherjee today said he would shortly call on Congress president Sonia Gandhi in Delhi.

 Mukherjee made it clear that he would meet Sonia and several other leaders during his stay in the capital. There are indications that he may be put up as a mayoral candidate by the Congress.

 ?The cat is out of the bag,? Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee remarked when told about Mukherjee?s plan to hold talks with Congress leaders.

 Mamata has initiated informal discussion with colleagues on selecting a new mayoral candidate as Mukherjee has declined to toe the party line not to have any truck with the Congress in view of its ?overt and covert entente with the CPM?. Several people, including Saugata Roy and Ajit Panja, are being considered in Trinamul circles for the party?s mayoral candidate.

 Mamata attributed Mukherjee?s advocacy of an alliance with the Congress to ?the Marxists? gameplan? to break her party on the eve of elections and asked party leaders to immediately initiate a drive to ?expose it?.

 Mukherjee today launched a blistering attack against the Trinamul leadership, accusing them of ?showing scant regard for democracy?. 

 ?I am a working committee member of the party, but it did not have the courtesy to invite me to its meeting yesterday,? the mayor said this afternoon.

 Mukherjee denied that he was ?out to break the party? by talking about an alliance with the Congress. ?I am ready to discuss the issue with Mamata again,? he said.

 However, the mayor did not try to hide that he was in touch with Congress leaders. ?I will go to Delhi and talk to Pranabda. I also intend to meet Sonia Gandhi,? he said.

 Trinamul leaders rejected Mukherjee?s allegation that the party lacked democracy.

 ?Mukherjee is perhaps the only person who has fully exploited his democratic rights. He has been serving as a Trinamul Congress mayor and was also allowed to continue as Intuc chief,? pointed out Sadhan Pande, a legislator and member of the party?s working committee.

 Trinamul leaders felt Mukherjee was distorting the concept of a mahajot by pleading for an alliance with the Congress, knowing that the party ?is now hand-in-glove with the CPM?.

 Calcutta, April 30: The resettlement wing of the defence services is aggressively pitching for the re-employment of ex-servicemen in the corporate sector.

 ?At a time when loyalty and employee skills are major concerns, retired personnel from the armed forces can be looked at,? said Shivaji Samaddar, the director in charge of resettlement in the eastern zone. 

 ?The armed forces instil over 900 varieties of skills, which can be used in the corporate sector. We are in touch with the chambers of commerce to supply manpower,? Samaddar said at the launch of Voice IT, a forum for IT and IT enabled services (ITES) companies, at the Indian Chamber of Commerce.

 More than 60,000 people retire from the services every year and 60 per cent of them are in the 30-35 age group, according to Samaddar.

 ?We want the companies to have a look at them. Our people are well conversant with the latest technologies and they stand a good chance in the IT and ITES industry,? he said.

 Samaddar said the defence establishment has decided to aggressively market the employment potential of these personnel in the private and public sectors.

 The widening skill gap and rising attrition rates in the IT and ITES industries were the main issues at the first meeting of the ICC forum.

 The suggestions to counter the attrition ranged from creating a more employee-friendly office environment to putting in place laws to reduce job-hopping.

 ?It is a fact that the attrition rate is going to rise in Calcutta and the industry will have to find ways and means to keep it under control,? said G.D. Gautama, the principal secretary, IT, who was the chief guest.

 The secretary also released a survey on the industry in Bengal that was conducted by the city-based association.

 Voice IT will act as a forum of knowledge-based companies and also aims to play an effective role in churning out the right kind of people for the industry.

 It will also organise regular interactive sessions with representatives of other industries.

 ?The objective (of forming the forum) is not to be another industry association and engage in policy discussions. We want to work with the industry and sort out the problems at the local level,? summed up Nazeeb Arif, the ICC secretary general.

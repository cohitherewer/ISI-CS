 Opposition to VAT

 Calcutta, Jan. 14: Economist and former finance minister Ashok Mitra today opposed value-added tax (VAT), which would replace the sales tax.

 Mitra demanded that a commission be set up to seek public opinion on the new tax. 

 He added that Delhi?s initiative to do away with sales tax was ?illegal and unconstitutional?. Pointed out that his successor Asim Dasgupta was one of the champions of the new levy and head of the committee of ministers to look after its implementation, Mitra said: ?The panel is powerless.?

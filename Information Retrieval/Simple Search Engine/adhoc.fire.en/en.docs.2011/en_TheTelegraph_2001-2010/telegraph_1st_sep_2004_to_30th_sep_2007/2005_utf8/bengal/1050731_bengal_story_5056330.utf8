 Jindal positive on steel plant

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 30: Sajjan Jindal today said there has been a lot of progress in the setting up of the Rs 10,000-crore steel plant in Bengal though there is no agreement between the state and Jharkhand on supply of iron ore.

 I had a good meeting with the chief minister, said the chairman and managing director of Jindal Iron amp; Steel Company.

 We are very keen to set up the plant here, though you are aware that the most crucial issue involved is that of the supply of iron ore from Jharkhand, said Jindal, who met Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings.

 The chief minister here has taken up the matter very strongly with the Centre and the Jharkhand government, Jindal said.

 Bengal is now an industry friendly state and the whole investment climate here is changing. A lot of interest is being shown towards industries and investment, he said.

 Jindal was positive about the proposed steel plant whose target is to produce 5 million tonnes every year. The progress has been very positive and the problem is expected to be sorted out within six months?.

 The entrepreneur said the compromise formula worked out between the two states is that the investment in Bengal would be around Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 2,000 crore for the neighbouring Jharkhand.

 Bhattacharjee said the matter was going to be sorted out soon.

 Yesterday, Jindal had inspected two plots near Kharagpur and said he hoped to lay the foundation stone of the plant on one of them in three months. He had inspected land at Dudhkundi and Indkhanra, about 175 km from Calcutta -- in the Jhargram subdivision of West Midnapore.

 In fact, he had hoped to set the foundation stone at Indkhanra within the next three months if everything works out well, and in which case the unit could come up in the next 36 months. Yesterday Jindal had said that iron ore wouldnt be a problem with Bhattacharjees efficiency and felt one eastern state would not hinder the progress of its neighbour.

 Job scheme for urban poor

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 2: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government is gearing up to quickly implement a Rs 50 crore scheme that will directly benefit the urban poor and generate employment for them, with elections to 82 municipalities scheduled for May.

 State finance minister Asim Dasgupta had announced in his budget the Rs 50 crore employment generation scheme for the urban poor.

 Last week, municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya met Dasgupta at Writers? Buildings to discuss the launch of the project.

 ?We will start off with the project shortly and are awaiting the flow of funds,? municipal affairs minister Bhattacharya said today. The government is calculating the number of people who would benefit from the scheme and selecting areas in the 126 municipalities of the state where the project would be initiated.

 Of the funds for the scheme, 60 per cent would be used for wages and 40 per cent on material.

 ?Under these schemes, the poor people in the urban areas can be directly engaged, without the involvement of contractors, for the purpose of improvement and maintenance of roads, drainage. This will result in employment generation as well as improvement and maintenance of infrastructure in the urban areas,? Dasgupta had said in his budget speech.

 ?Many municipality areas are backward, some of them with closed down factories, and several people in these areas are very poor and in dire need of employment. We will mainly focus on these areas with the aim of creating employment here,? Bhattacharya said. 

 The project would be implemented through community development societies or self-help groups formed by the state urban development agency under the municipal affairs department. The areas to be developed include roads, water supply such as tube-wells and drainage. 

 The Centre has started an employment assurance programme in rural areas and the state government has demanded that this be extended to urban areas, the municipal affairs minister said. 

 ?The Centre hasn?t announced any such scheme in this respect. So the state government has started such a scheme on its own. Though it is a small project involving only Rs 50 crore, it will ensure benefits and guarantee employment opportunities to those who are really poor,? Bhattacharya said.

 However, Trinamul Congress leaders alleged that the move was aimed at consolidating the CPM?s votebank in the run-up to the municipal polls.

 Teachers with nasty tongue take a bigger toll

 RICHA BANSAL

 Calcutta, July 16: Corporal punishment is banned by law and draws public wrath when reported but verbal abuse by teachers goes unnoticed. The effects, though, are far more damaging, say psychiatrists. 

 There is no fool-proof system of monitoring it, no law to protest against it and, unfortunately, in most cases parents choose to keep quiet for fear of backlash from the school.

 Aniruddha Deb, a psychiatrist, who works with children, had recorded the teachers quotes in the graphic. The incidents, involving a Class III and a nursery-level child, occurred at reputed schools. In the first case, the child was petrified of the teacher, while in the second, she was so anxious to perform that she could not, he says.

 I get at least two to three cases a week, he adds.

 Verbal abuse deals a severe blow to a childs self esteem, besides leading to apathy towards studies, say psychiatrists. It also hampers natural logical thinking and creativity.

 Rima Mukherji, another psychiatrist working with children, says: Teachers often take out personal frustrations on children and use very colourful language. Sadly, they get away with it because verbal abuse is far more difficult to prove than corporal punishment ? it is the teachers word against the childs, whereas corporal punishment leaves behind marks. 

 Though schools often have individual monitoring systems, their effectiveness is questionable, claim psychiatrists.

 For instance, Gillian Hart, the principal of Welland Gouldsmith School, makes her coordinators take a daily round of all classes while S.C. Singh, the principal of Nopany Vidyalaya, has started maintaining a register on teachers behaviour. 

 But it is not enough to have teachers assessing teachers, points out Mukherji. It is equally important to have students assess the teachers.

 The only school that practises this at the primary level is Mahadevi Birla Girls School. Headmistress Mailini Bhagat says: I send a questionnaire annually to parents of all 1,200 children, where teachers are assessed qualitatively on parameters of patience, level of interest, behavioural aspects etc. The feedback comes only to me, based on which I take up the situation. 

 Bhagat knows that even if all parents are not frank, some would come up with the truth.

 Awareness of parents is very crucial, asserts Deb. They need to be aware of the rights of the students and excesses of schoolteachers and listen to their children. Schools and parents also need to work in a collaborative manner.

 Agrees Sister Cyril, the principal of Loreto, Sealdah: The only way to tackle the problem is to create an atmosphere of love and caring in the school, where teachers, children and parents are all aware of what is acceptable and what is not.

 Devi Kar, the principal of Modern High School, adds: It is also important to understand the perspectives of both teachers and students and maintain an ongoing dialogue. 

 Nevertheless, incidents of verbal abuse occur. One of the main reasons is that teachers are over burdened and take out their stress on children, explains veteran teacher trainer Ayesha Das. Nobody ever addresses that. 

 Principals try and do what they can. Bhagat says: I send them to workshops for managing their stress but, ultimately, this is a profession which requires patience even under stress, as we are dealing with children. 

 Singh, however, adds: The crux of this problem is the management. Even if I want to do something to reduce the pressure on teachers, the management is not cooperative as most of their members are not educationists and have their eyes fixed on profit.

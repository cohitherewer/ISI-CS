 Hospital tests go private 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, Feb. 24: The health department has decided to hand over clinical test facilities at 19 rural hospitals in 13 districts to private organisations as the government will not be able to fill up vacancies to deal with an acute shortage of staff. 

 Private organisations will conduct clinical tests such as X-ray, ECG, ultra-sonography, blood sugar at government rates at these centres, said a circular issued by the principal secretary of the health department, Rajiv Dubey. 

 Rural hospitals are hamstrung by a shortage of staff and the government is not in a position to fill up all the vacancies, the circular said. East Midnapore, West Midnapore, Birbhum and Purulia districts will have two rural hospitals each with clinical laboratories, while Burdwan, Bankura, Hooghly, Nadia, Howrah and North 24-Parganas will have one such hospital each. 

 The private clinics will be allowed to use the hospital building and equipment and will be given electricity and water. In return, they will have to charge rates fixed by the government for tests, said an official. 

 ?To begin with, Gajol hospital is being handed over to private hands,? said Gopal Adhikari, the Malda chief medical officer of health. The clinical laboratories of Gajol rural hospital have been handed over to Malda Medical Centre, which runs a nursing home that has a tele-medicine contract with the Birla Heart Research Centre in Calcutta.

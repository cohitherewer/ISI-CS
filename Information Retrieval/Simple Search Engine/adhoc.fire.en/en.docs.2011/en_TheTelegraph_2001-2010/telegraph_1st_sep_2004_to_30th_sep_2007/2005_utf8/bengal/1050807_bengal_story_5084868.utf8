 Room for small players in boom town

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 6: There is more room for infotech firms in New Town, Rajarhat.

 The Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco), the implementing agency for the township, has developed a 30-acre plot to provide space for small- and medium-scale IT units.

 Housing minister and Hidco chairman Gautam Deb will hand over the plots to 48 entrepreneurs on Monday in the presence of infotech minister Manab Mukherjee. 

 Each plot measures bet- ween 20 and 60 cottahs.

 A few hundred small and medium entrepreneurs had applied for land in New Town and we tried our best to accommodate as many as possible. Demand for space around New Town has suddenly increased as Sector V in Salt Lake is saturated. We are developing large parts of New Town to make it suitable for IT and IT-enabled industries, Deb said.

 The government, he added, intends to provide space not only to the big players but to small entrepreneurs, too. We have allotted 45 acres to Webel for distributing it among those who intend to set up small IT units. 

 Hidco officials said about 300 acres in New Town have already been allotted to IT giants, including Wipro (40 acres), Bengal Unitech (50 acres), Assendes (20 acres), DLF (25 acres), Keppel Asia Ltd (25 acres). Many of the companies have begun construction.

 The focus should now be on infrastructure ? roads, bylanes, electricity, telephone and other facilities ? said an officer. 

 Deb said he had asked Hidco officials and engineers to keep in touch with the service providers to ensure that the new entrants do not face any problem getting power or phone connection.

 Officials said work is on to develop another 100 acres where housing complexes for those working in the tech firms would come up. 

 At least 50,000 people will be working in the various information technology units. So, we must provide them housing and other facilities. Besides, there must be provisions for their childrens education and entertainment, the Hidco chairman said.

 Applications for flats are pouring in, said an official. Most techies, he added, want accommodation either in New Town or Salt Lake because they want to stay close to their workplace.

 Instead of arranging individual flats at different housing estates, we felt it would be wise to build a separate complex to accommodate those engaged in the tech firms. We are developing the large chunk of land where there will be housing complexes, a market plaza, a park and an entertainment centre, an official said.

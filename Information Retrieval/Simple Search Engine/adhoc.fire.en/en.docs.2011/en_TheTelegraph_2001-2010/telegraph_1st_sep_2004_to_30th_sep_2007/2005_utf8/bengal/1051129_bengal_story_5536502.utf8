 Front not happy with poll drive

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 28: The Left Front today expressed displeasure over the Election Commissions determination to bar people who have non-bailable arrest warrants pending against them from voting or contesting elections. 

 Front chairman Biman Bose said Left leaders discussed the issue at a meeting today and felt that until a person was convicted of a crime, it would not be right to delete his or her name from the voters list.

 If enforced, such a move by the Election Commission would be tantamount to interference with the democratic rights. If an undertrials name is deleted from the voters list, it would be curbing fundamental rights, Bose said. 

 He, however, hastened to add that this was a mere observation on the basis of press reports in this regard. 

 We will decide our course of action when we come to know about it officially. We might seek legal opinion, too. 

 The commission, too, should look into the legal aspects ? whether it was within its purview to enforce such a decision, said Bose, also a CPM politburo member. 

 Cases against criminals and those involved in political movements should not be treated alike, he added. The situation in all states is not the same. If all states are put in the same bracket, it would create difficulties. 

 About 72,000 non-bailable arrest warrants are pending in the state.

 A poll panel team touring the state has hauled up 25 state government officers for neglecting duty at polling booths in course of inspections since Saturday. They complained about designated officers coming in late or departing early. In some cases, the designated officers were not sitting at polling booths at all, chief electoral officer Debashish Sen said.

 Chief election commissioner B.B. Tandon will be in the city on Wednesday. He will inaugurate the electoral information service on SMS the next day and meet several district magistrates.

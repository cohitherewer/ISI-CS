 Sixties on lips, Subrata in Cong

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 27: Former mayor Subrata Mukherjee and three Trinamul Congress legislators today joined the Congress.

 At a convention held on July 31, Mukherjee had said he would formally join the Congress after meeting Congress president Sonia Gandhi. 

 Having called on Sonia in New Delhi two days ago, Subrata today announced that he has joined the Congress.

 Defence minister and PCC chief Pranab Mukherjee, water resources development minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and Congress leader Somen Mitra were among those present at the state party office where Subrata Mukherjee, Ambika Banerjee, Paras Dutta and Nirbed Roy announced their decision.

 However, three other Trinamul legislators ? Ashoke Deb, Tapas Roy and Paresh Pal ? who had played a key role in the formation of the Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha along with Mukherjee, gave a miss to todays programme citing engagements elsewhere.

 Political observers said the three stayed away as they were still undecided about returning to the Congress. 

 Tapas Roy, who is an MLA from Burrabazar, said he still considers himself to be a Trinamul man. Ashok Deb from Budge Budge and Paresh Pal from Manicktala are also in touch with Mamata, Trinamul sources said.

 Pranab Mukherjee told reporters that those who had deserted the Congress should emulate Subrata and return to the party. Our doors are open for everybody.

 The former mayor said he was feeling comfortable after his return to the Congress. This is rather a homecoming. We shall all work together to dislodge the ruling CPM from Bengal as we did in the sixties. Let us all work together to rejuvenate the Congress in the run-up to next years Assembly polls to ensure the CPMs defeat.

 PCC sources said Mukherjee may be put up as a Congress nominee for the Asansol byelections slated for September 28. 

 However, Subratas detractors said this would be a blunder.

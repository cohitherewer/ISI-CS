 CM views triple-town plan 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 7: In a bid to ease pressure on the city, the government is planning residential and industrial townships in areas skirting the metro ? in Howrah, Hooghly and South 24-Parganas.

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said: ?We?ve already identified over 8,000 acres for the townships in South 24-Parganas, Hooghly and Howrah.? 

 Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority officials today made their presentation before chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen, Bhattacharya and chief secretary Asok Gupta.

 ?We want to prevent mushrooming of townships the way it has happened in Jadavpur and Sonarpur in the past decade. Developed land is very scarce in the city and promoters are using it in an unplanned manner,? Bhattacharya said.

 A part of the land will be reserved for residential purposes. The rest will house industries, corporate enclaves, hospitals and medical colleges. The government will construct the connecting roads and the townships will be built either by private parties themselves or jointly with the government.

 Bhattacharya said the chief minister has given his approval to the plan and the land acquisition would begin soon.

 ?We told the chief minister that a lot of land would go waste if we do not plan the townships in a phased manner. Very little agricultural land will be used in these projects as there is hardly any in the proposed areas. Only a single crop is cultivated in some,? he added. 

 The government plans to acquire about 1,000 acres in Howrah along National Highway 6 ? at Salap and Jagadishpur in Domjur and in Liluah.

 ?Once the second Vivekananda Bridge is complete, Belghoria Expressway will be connected to the airport via Jessore Road. With three national highways passing alongside, the area is poised for rapid growth,? Bhattacharya said.

 Another 5,010 acres have been identified at Hooghly?s Dankuni. A township has been planned over 4,000 acres and the rest of the land would be taken up by industries.

 The government also has big plans for Baruipur, Sonarpur and Amtala in South 24- Parganas, which have seen a 40 per cent population growth between 1991 and 2001 ? the highest in the Calcutta metropolitan area. 

 In the new scheme, Baruipur will be the district headquarters.

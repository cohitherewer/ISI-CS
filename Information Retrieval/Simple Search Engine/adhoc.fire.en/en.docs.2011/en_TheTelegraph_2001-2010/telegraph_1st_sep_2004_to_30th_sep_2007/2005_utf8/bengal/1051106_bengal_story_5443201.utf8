 Manabesh gets bail, still in jail

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Balurghat, Nov. 5: Former CPM district secretary of South Dinajpur Manabesh Chowdhury today decided not to move out of the Balurghat jail until all criminal cases pending against him are disposed of.

 He had surrendered before chief judicial magistrate Anjali Sinhas court on October 24 and was remanded in jail custody. He was produced before the chief judicial magistrates court today.

 Chowdhury was brought to the court around 10.15 this morning in a prison van along with 34 other criminals but was given the seat beside the driver. He remained in the court lock-up till 3.30 pm.

 Even after getting bail in a criminal case today, Chowdhury did not furnish his bail bond. Instead, he decided to stay back in the jail until the criminal case pending against him with the additional district and sessions judges special court is disposed of. In three other cases, Chowdhury has already got bail from the court.

 The case in which Chowdhury was not granted bail was in connection with rioting and assaulting a Congress worker at Gangarampur in 1984. However, 19 other co-accused, including former minister of state for cottage and small scale industries Narayan Biswas, were acquitted.

 Chowdhurys lawyer, Biswarup Chatterjee said: Though Chowdhury was granted bail today, we did not furnish the bond as we want him to come out of jail after the hearing of the bail petition in the case initiated against him for allegedly attacking the house of Congress leader Biplab Mitra in 1983.

 He said the case is expected to be heard before the district sessions court on Monday in Balurghat. In the said matter, the other accused have already been acquitted. However, an appeal was made before the high court against the acquittal order. It is expected that Chowdhury will get bail when the matter is heard.

 Niren Biswas, brother of Narayan Biswas, surrendered before court today. There were four cases pending against him. 

 He was granted bail in one and was remanded in jail custody till November 19 in two other cases. 

 The third case could not be heard as the records could not be found.

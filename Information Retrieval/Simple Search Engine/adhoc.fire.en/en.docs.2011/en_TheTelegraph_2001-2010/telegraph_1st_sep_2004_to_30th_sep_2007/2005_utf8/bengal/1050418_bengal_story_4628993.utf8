 BRIEFS

 Barasat, April 17: Paritosh Mahanta, 35, of Nataberia was beaten to death last night after he fired at a fellow villager who asked him not to pass through his land with a herd of cattle. 

 North 24-Parganas police said Samir Mondal and Mahanta had an old enmity over the possession of a plot in the village, about 65 km from Calcutta. Mahanta fired at Mondal from his pipe-gun. The villagers also beat up his wife and daughter, who had to be hospitalised.

 Krishnagar: Five days after six-year-old Suprabhat Ghosh?s body was fished out from a pond, his uncle Joydeb Ghosh confessed that his son Haru had killed him. Haru, 19, was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly strangling his cousin to death to grab his uncle?s property. 

 Howrah: A day after a monkey critically injured a man, the forest department sent a team to Sankrail in Howrah to probe the monkey menace. Divisional forest officer Joydeb Mukhopadhyay said after receiving a report, ?we will take appropriate action?. The primates have been on the rampage, destroying fruits and crops and raiding houses.

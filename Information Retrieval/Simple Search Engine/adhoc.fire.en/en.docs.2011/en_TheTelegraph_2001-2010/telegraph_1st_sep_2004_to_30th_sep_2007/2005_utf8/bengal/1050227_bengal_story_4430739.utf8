 Doctors in NRS lock-up

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 26: Doctors and nurses were today locked up in a room of NRS Medical College and Hospital?s surgery department for nearly two hours as a patient?s relatives went on the rampage following two failed surgeries on her.

 Anju Sarkar, 28, from Belghoria on the northern fringes of the city was admitted to the hospital on Tuesday for a simple gall-bladder surgery. The doctors performed a laparoscopic procedure on her the very next day, but things did not go according to plan and the patient developed complications shortly after the operation.

 ?The doctors then decided on yet another surgery, this time an open procedure to see what had gone wrong,? said D.K. Jha, the deputy superintendent of the hospital. On Thursday, doctors completed the open surgery and made round-the-clock arrangements for Anju?s care. 

 However, her condition began to deteriorate leading to panic among relatives. As the complications increased, they requested Bitan Chatterjee, the surgeon concerned, to carry out more investigations. 

 A detailed probe revealed renal failure. A common post-operative complication, renal failure among gall-bladder patients occurs because of leakage of bile into the stomach caused by injury to the bile duct during surgery. In many cases, doctors said, septicaemia, too, causes renal failure in post-surgery patients.

 ?We do not know what happened in this case, but the patient?s relatives were raising a lot of questions regarding the surgery, which we will have to check and find out through an independent inquiry,? a senior hospital official said.

 The medical team, virtually taken hostage today, was allowed to leave the surgery wing after director of medical education C.R. Maiti stepped in and got the patient shifted to SSKM Hospital for better care. 

 With the NRS?s dialysis unit shut for over two months because of the construction of a water-treatment plant, the nephrologists asked by the authorities to look into Anju?s case pleaded helplessness.

 In the absence of an intensive care unit, NRS has to depend on its intensive therapeutic unit to provide care to patients. Jha said: ?As her (Anju?s) condition was turning serious, we planned to refer her to SSKM Hospital, where she could get better care, including ventilators.?

 But the authorities at SSKM informed that they did not have any extra bed. ?I told them that we need time to arrange for another bed,? said SSKM medical superintendent Santanu Tripathi.

 As this news spread among Anju?s relatives, they gheraoed the entire surgery department of NRS and refused to let any medical staff leave till a decision was made about her treatment. 

 Maiti?s intervention, however, ensured an extra bed at SSKM. ?Her condition is very serious and we have our fingers crossed,? said Tripathi.

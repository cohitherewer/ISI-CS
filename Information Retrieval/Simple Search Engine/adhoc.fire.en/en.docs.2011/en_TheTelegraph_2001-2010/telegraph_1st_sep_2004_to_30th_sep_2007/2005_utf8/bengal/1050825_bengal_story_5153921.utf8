 Court asks cop to open drug lock

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 24: Calcutta High Court today directed the inspector-in-charge of Shibpur to take necessary steps to remove drugs worth Rs 13 crore from a government godown in Howrah. 

 The drugs, including life-saving ones, belong to the medicine firm Nicholas Piramal India Limited.

 Justice Jayanta Biswas also asked the inspector-in-charge to make an inventory of the drugs kept in Ware House and supply copies to both the pharmaceutical company and Prayas Service Private Limited, which had been engaged by the medicine firm to distribute its drugs across the state.

 Nicholas Piramal had moved the high court, saying some employees of Prayas erected a tent outside the godown and prevented the company from taking the drugs out.

 Appearing for Nicholas Piramal, advocate Subroto Mookherjee said that when Prayas failed to carry out its job of distributing the drugs, his client cancelled the agreement with the firm. But when my clients company went to remove the drugs from the godown, the employees prevented them from doing so, the lawyer alleged.

 The distributor company is saying that as the employees were engaged in an industrial dispute with the management, they are not allowing the pharmaceutical company to remove the drugs. As a result, several critical patients have been suffering seriously, Mookherjee said.

 The employees and the management of the distributor company have no right to prevent ailing people from getting drugs, he argued.

 Nicholas Piramal had lodged a complaint at Shibpur police station on March 29, the lawyer told the court. But till date, the police have not taken any steps against the agitating employees.

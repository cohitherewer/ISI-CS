 Long wait, ringed by well-wishers

 Calcutta, Feb. 5: Roma was lost, the distraught Jhawars were at their wit?s end. But as soon as news of the abduction on Friday morning reached them, relatives and friends started arriving, to console them, advise them and shield them from the prying media. 

 Roma Jhawar?s sister-in-law Sunita held the family together, dealing with the guests and comforting her mother-in-law, Pushpa Devi. All along, their eyes and ears were on the phone in the sitting room of the first-floor flat of CB 68, waiting for a call that would reveal Roma?s whereabouts. 

 Political leaders of Salt Lake, cutting across party lines, also dropped in from evening, assuring the family that all is being done to rescue Roma and she should be back soon. 

 Around 9.30 pm, Jyoti Basu?s confidential secretary Joykrishna Ghosh turned up. The family members broke down, urging him to ?do something to rescue Roma??. Before him, Trinamul councillor Ujjal Das and CPM MP Amitava Nandy had paid their visits. 

 When Nandy visited the family, Roma?s mother and sister-in-law pleaded with him to ensure her safe return. ?We are ready to pay anything. We just want Roma back,?? a relative told him. ?We don?t know where she is or how she is. I only hope that she is returned safely to the family. We don?t want her harmed in any way.?

 Complementing the consoling relatives were businessmen and influential neighbours. They discussed possible motives ? apart from ransom ? behind the abduction. Did Satya Narayan, Roma?s businessman father, have any rivalry or dispute with anyone that could have prompted the kidnapping? Satya Narayan shook his head. He could not remember anything that could lead to anybody harming his family. 

 Around 10 pm, a group led by Marwari Federation leader Kamal Gandhi ? also a Salt Lake resident ? and industrialist Govind Sarda got together at the BA block residence of Satya Narayan?s brother ? a stone?s throw from the Jhawars? house ? probably to discuss the ransom. The family had received a demand for Rs 50 lakh. 

 Later, Gandhi met Satya Narayan and asked him not to worry about money. They spoke for some time, discussing the possible options before the Jhawar family. As the evening wore on, they also discussed the police efforts to trace Roma and her abductors. 

 Outside, a fleet of cars and vans were parked near the building. Armed policemen were deployed at the entrance and refused to let anybody in without cross-checking with family members. 

 It seemed like a night without end as Roma?s elder brother, Rajesh, along with some friends and neighbours, kept moving in and out of the house. ?Kuch pata mila kya? (Any news?),? he was asked every time he returned. 

 Dinner was not on anybody?s mind. Nandy called again after midnight. 

 Around 3 am, the telephone rang. A relative rushed to receive the call. ?Mil gaya?. mil gaya,? he shouted. The others ? most were dozing off after a tension-filled day ? woke with a start and gathered around him. 

 Satya Narayan snatched the receiver. It was Rajesh at the other end, who confirmed that Roma was coming back. 

 The nightmare finally ended when Sunita took another call, confirming that Roma was on her way home.

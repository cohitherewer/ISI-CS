 Cong keeps ?pact? alive

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 14: A Congress-Trinamul Congress pact before the civic polls slated for June is possible, Pranab Mukherjee said today.

 The Congress, Mukherjee said, would not seek to thwart ?an informal and grassroots level? understanding between supporters of the two parties. The state Congress president hastened to add that, otherwise, the party would go it alone. 

 ?We are helpless if Congress and Trinamul members, under pressure from voters, forge an electoral understanding at the grassroots to counter the CPM,? Mukherjee told a news conference. 

 A formal alliance with Trinamul is out of question as long as Mamata Banerjee keeps her relations with the BJP alive. ?If she wants us as an ally, she must sever links with the BJP before the coming elections. Otherwise, we will have to put up candidates for all wards,? said Mukherjee, also the defence minister.

 In June, 88 civic bodies across the state, including Calcutta Municipal Corporation, are scheduled to go to polls. Former state Congress chief Somen Mitra, an anathema to Mamata, will oversee the party?s electioneering in the city. 

 Asked about Trinamul leader Subrata Mukherjee?s performance as mayor, Mukherjee evaded a straight answer. ?People will judge,? he said. 

 Observers said the Congress chief does not want to antagonise the mayor who has earned accolades from several party leaders, including water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munhsi.

 Amid Mukherjee?s renewed call to its members to switch over to the Congress, the Trinamul brass issued a circular asking all its councillors in the city to be present at a rally on February 22 to be addressed by Mamata .

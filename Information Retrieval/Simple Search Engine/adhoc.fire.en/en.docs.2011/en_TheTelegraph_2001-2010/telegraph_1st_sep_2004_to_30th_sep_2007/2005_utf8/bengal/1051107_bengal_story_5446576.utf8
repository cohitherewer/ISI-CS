 Chopper hunt for trekker

 VIVEK CHHETRI

 Nov. 6: Two mountain rescue experts from Germany today conducted an aerial survey of the Yuksom-Gochala trekking trail in West Sikkim be- fore heading there on foot to trace Hans Obermoyer, who went missing nine days ago.

 As Bauman Andu Simon and Diem Tanja led two teams comprising local people, porters and policemen, Sikkim police expressed fear that the 49-year-old German might have gone down a 1,000-ft deep gorge into the Rathangchu river, which flows from the Rathang glacier.

 Peno and Lego, the sniffer dogs that have been flown in from Germany, accompanied the eight-member search teams today.

 B.K. Tamang, the West district superintendent of police, said: The rescuers conducted a survey on a Pawan Hans helicopter at 7.30 am and then headed to Bakim where Obermoyer went missing around 9 pm on October 28. 

 Our investigations suggest that the tourist took an alternative route (about 3 km from the usual trail) and probably slipped and fell in the darkness at a place called Thangchung.

 Police teams had found a walking stick, a packet of tissue paper and a clip from a rucksack at Bakim during searches conducted earlier. 

 All the articles were identified as belonging to Obermoyer by his four companions and the guide, Penjo Sherpa. 

 The rescue teams are expected to continue their search till Wednesday.

 No bloodstain or other evidence has been found yet to suggest that Obermoyer had been attacked, Tamang said. 

 The German dogs, he added, would be of great help as they are capable of sniffing out rotting flesh.

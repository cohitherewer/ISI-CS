 Japan deadline stricture

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, March 12: The Japan Bank for International Cooperation, which funds the city?s flyovers and allied projects, has fixed a September 30 deadline for the completion of a string of projects worth Rs 26 crore.

 Failing the time-frame, the government will have to bear the burden. 

 The projects include widening and repairing of Canal East Road, improvement of Maniktala crossing, de-reservation of tram tracks from Mullickbazar to Park Circus and from Triangular Park to Lake Market.

 The bank cleared the Rs 26-crore package insisting that the deadline be adhered to. HRBC, the implementing agency for the transport infrastructure project, was told that the bank will wind up activities on September 30 and will not extend it thereafter.

 If the work is unfinished, the government would have to complete it at its own cost. 

 Officials at Writers? Buildings said the chief minister, who had expressed annoyance over the delay in completing the Park Street flyover and had even apologised to the public, has asked the chief secretary to take steps to finish the job on time.

 Transport department officials said the Japanese funding agency had on a number of occasions expressed dissatisfaction over the tardy progress of work on the Park Street flyover project. 

 Deadline for the work had to be extended following requests from the top office in the state secretariat. But this time, an official said, the bank made it clear that it does not want a repetition of the Park Street fiasco. 

 ?We want to see the package through within the deadline and will not tolerate any delay,?? a Japan bank official is believed to have told the transport officials while discussing the new package.

 Gauging the mood, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has sounded the alarm bells. Senior officers have been told to intensify monitoring and remove all hurdles to the smooth completion of the work. 

 HRBC vice-chairman Sadhan Banerjee said: ?We have made it clear to the contractor (Tantia Construction), who has been awarded the contract for the Rs 26-crore project, that it has to finish within the deadline. If the contractor misses the mark, it will have to bear the cost for completing the project.?

 The government has been urging the bank to give permission to spend Rs 30 crore, lying surplus from the four flyover projects, for the improvement of roads.

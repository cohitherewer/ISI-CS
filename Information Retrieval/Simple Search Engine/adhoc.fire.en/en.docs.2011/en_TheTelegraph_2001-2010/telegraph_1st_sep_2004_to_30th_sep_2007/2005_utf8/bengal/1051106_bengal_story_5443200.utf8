 Air rage to tell on road

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Fight in sky, Rumble on ground

 Calcutta, Nov. 5: Just when the F-16s and the Sukhoi-30s soar into the skies over the Kalaikunda air force station on Monday, CPM activists will besiege the city airport, the American Center and major intersections to protest the Indo-US war games.

 With the induction process of the US and Indian Air Force fighter planes and personnel nearing completion, the focus is now on the day the war games start. We will hold rallies on Monday and continue them wherever and whenever we get the opportunity, said Amitava Nandi, CPM MP from Dum Dum.

 Left Front chairman Biman Bose, along with senior party leaders, will address a gathering of CPM supporters around 2 pm. Since the rallies will converge from both Jessore Road and VIP Road, people travelling on these two routes are likely to be stranded.

 Anil Biswas will address another rally near the American Center around the same time.

 Although the CPM leadership has been stressing that the agitation would be peaceful, police are expecting widespread disruption.

 We will ensure that the public does not face any problem, said Anuj Sharma, the deputy commissioner of police (headquarters). 

 The CPM leadership in West Midnapore was also making elaborate arrangements for demonstrations throughout the exercise in Kalaikunda.

 We will disrupt the exercise at any cost, said Dipak Sarkar, West Midnapore CPM district secretary.

 Twelve F-16 fighter jets have arrived at the airbase. Apart from the state-of-the-art US air force fighters, several Indian MiG-29s, Mirage 2000, and Sukhoi-30s will participate in the exercise.

 About 250 US air force personnel have landed at the Kalaikunda station along with 400 of their Indian counterparts for the war games.

 Sick units

 Calcutta, March 22: Two bills that sought to privatise Engel India Machines and Tools and West Bengal Chemical Industries were passed in the Assembly today.

 The Opposition parties walked out when law minister Nisith Adhikary tabled the bills instead of industries minister Nirupam Sen, who was indisposed. The government had said it would privatise 19 of its loss-making units by March-end.

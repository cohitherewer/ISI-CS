 20-yr-old divorces for dignity

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar (Nadia), May 28: Another harassed wife from Nadias Nakashipara area has opted for divorce and got back the dowry paid to her husband.

 Twenty-year-old Sarikan Bibi from Gotpara village, about 130 km from Calcutta, married farmer Sukai Khan two years ago. She was harassed and humiliated by her husband and in-laws for failing to bear a child.

 The bone of contention between Sukai and me was my inability to bear children. I could not make him realise that he, too, might be responsible for it, she said.

 Sarikan, a school dropout, said she was inspired by Reshma Khatun, Khursia Begum and others who divorced their husbands with police help to live with dignity. As many as 20 women, acting on their own, have opted for divorce.

 An officer told me that resorting to the legal procedure could take a long time and urged me to follow the path of those girls who got divorce through mutual consent. I readily agreed, she said.

 Four days ago, Sarikan got a divorce through mutual consent and today got back Rs 25,000 Sukai had taken as dowry. Nakashipara circle inspector A. Rashidujjaman said: She has withdrawn Rs 3,000 to start a weaving business.

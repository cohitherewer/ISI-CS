 DYFI leader shot dead

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 21: A leader of the CPMs youth wing, DYFI, Dhruba Naskar, was shot dead allegedly by party activists in South 24-Parganas last night.

 Preliminary investigation revealed that the murder of 42-year-old Dhruba who was also a member of the CPMs local committee, was a fallout of a rivalry among two or more realtors, all apparently belonging to the party, police said.

 The police have arrested Rajiv Majumdar and Subir Pal, who the deceaseds wife Sharmila claimed were local committee members of the CPM.

 We are looking for four more persons, said district superintendent of police S.N. Gupta. The absconding persons are also said to be CPM local committee members.

 Residents of Uttar Dongaria in Nodakhali area, 35 km from Calcutta, said Dhruba used to deal in building materials and supplied mostly to a local promoter, Krishna Mondal, reportedly a CPM local committee member.

 Around 10.30 last night, I saw Dhruba speaking to half-a-dozen people on the road opposite to his house. The conversation developed into an altercation. Suddenly, I heard shots being fired and someone cry out in pain, said Tapas Sardar, a neighbour and an eyewitness. Dhruba was injured in the chest, forehead and stomach. The miscreants had hacked his ankle, too.

 Hearing the gunshots, Sharmila rushed out and cried for help. He was taken to the local hospital and then to Vidyasagar Hospital in Behala, where he was declared dead.

 The CPMs district committee member, Tulsi Majhi, said: Dhruba was a very good and effective worker of our party. Those arrested have criminal antecedents. I am not sure whether they are our party members.

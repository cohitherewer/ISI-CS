 2 die after school meal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Purulia, Feb. 11: Two sisters died and their siblings had to be hospitalised yesterday after they ate mid-day meals at a primary school in Jhalda, about 315 km from Calcutta. 

 Jaba, who was eight and in Class II, and four-year-old Koli, a nursery student, died hours after returning home. Rahul, 5, and Kusum, 6, who underwent treatment at the Deben Mahato hospital in Purulia town, were released today. 

 Paitu Kumar, a daily wager, and his wife had no help at hand when Jaba complained of a splitting headache. She died on her mother?s lap. Koli, who also had headache, died on way to the Kotsila health centre, 4 km from their house. 

 The siblings brought home part of the khichuri served at Matkuma Primary School and had it late in the afternoon. 

 A family source said they could not finish the entire helping at one go and so carried home the remaining in aluminium bowls. 

 R. Shivkumar, the district superintendent of police, said an investigation has begun. ?We have collected samples of the khichuri both from Paitu Kumar?s house and the school. We?ll send them for laboratory tests to find if it had become contaminated.?

 The district administration echoed a section of villagers in claiming that the mid-day meal did not claim the children. Mukul Sarkar, the district magistrate, pointed out that only four out of 250 students of Matkuma Primary School took ill yesterday. 

 ?We don?t know if Kumar?s children ate anything else after returning home. The cause of their deaths can be ascertained only after we get the post-mortem reports,? he said.

 Bikram Hansda, the Jhalda subdivisional officer, said there was ?some kind of food-poisoning?.

 Durgapur, Dec. 5: The town has seen 15 petrol pump heists in two years. But the burglars better beware now. Or they might get a thrashing from some girls. 

 Six of them ? three of who know karate ? have taken up jobs at a refuelling station, BP Durgapur. It is the only one run by women in Burdwan district.

 Aged between 20 and 23, Sanchita Deb and Vindia Wasini Dubey study in Durgapur Government College. Re-kha Karmakar, Barna Bauri and Anna Ghosh are graduates. The youngest, Monika Ghosh, passed HS last year.

 At City Centre here, 200 km from Calcutta, the girls in maroon T-shirts, grey trousers, black shoes and blue caps work in shifts from 6 am to 10 pm. At the end of the month, they get Rs 2,000.

 Sanchita, Vindia and Barna are trained in karate. 

 The pump manager, Sanchita, a final-year political science honours student, has made it clear to the five others that smiling at customers is a must. Make them feel at ease, she tells them.

 I and Vindia work in the 2-10 pm shift. I have made it clear to her, we must become graduates, said Sanchita. 

 I was in Class VI when I lost my father, a contract worker at DSP (Durgapur Steel Plant). I wanted to be a lawyer, but.... Now I can provide some relief to my mother and two sisters, said Sanchita. 

 Her mother is a door-to-door sari salesperson and also earns around Rs 2,000 a month. We found it difficult to run the family of four. Suddenly this opportunity came in September. I was selected from about 150 others.

 Vindia, 20, was an athlete in school and represented Durgapur subdivision. Her father Ramji Dubey, a retired DSP employee, was admitted at the steel plant hospital a couple of months ago with ailments that required surgery. My mother is aged. I have a brother who will sit for HS next year. We found it difficult to make ends meet with my fathers meagre pension. I know what I earn is insufficient, but it helps, said Vindia. Barna, Rekha, Anna and Monika all have similar stories to tell. 

 Priyanko Ghosh, who operates the pump that belongs to Bharat Petroleum Corporation, said the group of six is doing a super job. They are polite, honest... customers feel comfortable with them.

 Durgapur additional superintendent of police Anand Kumar said: We keep special watch on the pump. Not that the girls want any special treatment, though.

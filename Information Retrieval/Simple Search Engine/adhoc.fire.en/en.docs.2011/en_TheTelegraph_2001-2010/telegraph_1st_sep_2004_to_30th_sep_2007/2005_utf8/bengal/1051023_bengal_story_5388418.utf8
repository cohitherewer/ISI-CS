 Knee-deep in distress

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 22: When Kartick Roy stepped out of his home in Kasbas K.P. Roy Lane after two days, it was to shift bag and baggage. With rainwater gushing into the rooms and food supplies fast dwindling, Roy, who has two minor children, had no other option.

 Several parts of the city, including Bansdroni, Kasba, Mominpur and Topsia, were knee-deep in water as rain continued to play havoc for the fifth consecutive day today.

 D.P. Deb Gupta, a chartered accountant who stays opposite Tiljala police station, has been attempting to attend office for the last few days, but in vain.

 The residents of Kestopur, Lake Town and Baguihati had braved the downpour to go shopping for food, but returned empty-handed. With no fresh supplies of bread and even milk, I had to opt for a pack of skimmed milk. The markets also wore a deserted look with no supplies as most shops were closed, said Subarna Choudhury, who lives in Lake Town.

 Around 5.30 this morning, Sunil Ruidas and Bhubi Ruidas were cycling to Ghotokpur off EM Bypass, when they tripped on 440-volt live wires. Police said the two had failed to notice the wires, which were lying in a puddle. They died even before they could be taken to hospital. A part of an old building on 77, Diamond Harbour Road collapsed tonight, but no one was hurt.

 The rain took its toll on Kumartulis artisans as well. With Kali Puja just over a week away, the idols are half-done. Worse, some of their houses are full of water. At the moment, we are desperately trying to save ourselves and our families, and if the rains continues, only the lord can save us, said Swapan Pal.

 At the National Library in Alipore, people had to be turned away as parts of the annexe and a portion of the Bhasha Bhawan remained waterlogged.

 The water level has been rising everyday and there is no word from the authorities. There must be some effort from the administration to bail us out of this crisis, complained Asima De, a resident of Dhakuria where people tried to wade through water that touched their knees.

 Even hospitals were not spared. Doctors at the lens-transplantation unit of the Regional Institute of Ophthalmology had asked me to turn up today for a test and I had braved the rains from Dum Dum for a check-up. But with the water seeping into the elevator and the staff absent, the check-up couldnt take place, said Satyaki Chatterjee. 

 The hospital administration pleaded helplessness. Water has seeped into the ground floor of the hospital and we have informed the health top-brass, said Amarendra Biswas, the deputy superintendent of Medical College and Hospital that houses the institute. 

 The situation was as grim in SSKM, where the departments of plastic surgery and anatomy remained shut.

 HC asks CBI to probe police 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 21: The high court today ordered a CBI inquiry into the death of Soumendu Mondal, who was picked up without a warrant.

 Police officers had claimed later that he fled from their custody.

 When Soumendu?s 74-year-old mother Bibhadevi went to Kharagpur (local) police station last July, looking for him, an officer said: ?He is in custody, you cannot see him? We?ll let you know about him later.? 

 The widow from Jaguri village in West Midnapore, about 110 km from Calcutta, returned home. Next day, July 8, the same officer and a few others from the police station travelled about 20 km to tell Bibhadevi that soon after his arrest Soumendu, 34, had managed to escape. ?We are looking for him. If you come across him or get to know his whereabouts, do not fail to inform us.? 

 At no point, the policemen gave out the truth ? that Soumendu, who had been arrested for suspected Naxalite links, had a violent death in the police lock-up. Neither the court papers nor the police chargesheet contains any reference to the political angle.

 Justice Pranab Kumar Chatterjee today said the circumstances leading to the death inside the Kharagpur police station must be known. ?A mystery surrounds the death of the young man. The cause of as well as the circumstances that led to the death must be known to the public. This court is directing the CBI to probe the matter and submit a report...?

 The lawyer for Bibhadevi told the court: ?They (the police) cannot be expected to inquire into allegations of misdeeds committed by some of their colleagues.?

The order, a critical commentary on the workings of 

the police ? a department looked after by the chief minister himself ? means the 

force will have to submit ?all relevant documents relating to the case to the 

CBI immediately?.

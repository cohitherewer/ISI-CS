 BRIEFS

 Behrampore/Calcutta, Nov. 8: Murshidabad district judge B.N. Das today rejected the anticipatory bail prayer of MP Adhir Chowdhurys wife Arpita.

 Along with the Congress leader, Arpita is an accused in the twin murders in the town that took place on the night of July 23. She prayed for bail on medical grounds. 

 Chowdhury, however, continued to remain defiant. He again said from Delhi this morning: I am not going to surrender, come what may. He called on defence minister and state party president Pranab Mukherjee at his residence today.

 Santiniketan: Czech Republic President Vaclav Klaus will be here on Wednesday to accept an honorary Desikottama for excellence in economics. Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor Sujit Basu will confer the honour on him.

 Calcutta: Telephone services at the airport and its adjoining areas collapsed on Tuesday following a snag in the Dum Dum exchange. Airport officials said no calls could be made or received till late in the evening.

 Calcutta: The Election Commission has asked the states chief electoral officer to hold neighbourhood meetings, chaired by a respected non-political person, to check the accuracy of the electoral rolls. The objective, an official said, is to involve people in the roll revision.

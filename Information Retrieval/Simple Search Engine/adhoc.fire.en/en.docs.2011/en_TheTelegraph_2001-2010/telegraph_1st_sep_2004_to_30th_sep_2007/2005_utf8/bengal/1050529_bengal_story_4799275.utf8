 Truant teachers

 Midnapore, May 28: School education minister Kanti Biswas admitted today that many schoolteachers are drawing salaries without taking classes, reports our correspondent.

 Biswas said, in his constituency, he had recently taken a teacher to his school and asked the students to identify him. None of the students knew that he was a teacher supposed to take their classes, the minister said.

 The number of teachers who draw salaries without taking classes is not few? some of them are even associated with political parties. They do all kinds of work, and fulfil all their other commitments except teaching. This is a social crime.

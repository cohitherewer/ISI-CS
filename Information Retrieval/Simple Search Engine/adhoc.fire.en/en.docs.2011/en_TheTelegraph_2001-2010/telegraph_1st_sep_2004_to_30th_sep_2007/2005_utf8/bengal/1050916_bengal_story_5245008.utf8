 CPM debate on funds

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 15: CPM politburo member and Rajya Sabha MP Sitaram Yechury today admitted there has been a healthy debate within the party over foreign direct investment and loans from the World Bank and other international agencies.

 We have discussed at length the issue during the last party congress and framed some guidelines for accepting such foreign funds. Still, we have to face questions on why our government in Bengal is inviting foreign capital in the state and why our party is protesting against the Orissa governments move to accept FDI, Yechury said.

 He was delivering the Naren Sen Memorial Lecture on India 2020, organised by the CPMs Calcutta district committee this evening.

 However, Yechury was silent on the proposed Salim Group projects in Bengal and the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments move for the states industrialisation with the support of foreign funds.

 World Bank representatives had approached Jyoti Basu when he was chief minister regarding sanction of loan, Yechury said.

 Strangely, they had also urged Basu to inform them about the states annual budget. But Basu had refused to do so as the budget was not placed in the Assembly at that time. I am referring this only to let you know the communists approach towards acceptance of foreign funds.

 Yechury said his party had organised a violent agitation against Chandrababu Naidu as the then chief minister of Andhra Pradesh had mortgaged government properties to obtain World Bank loans.

 The government has failed to repay the loans and properties of the state government have become unsafe. We are opposed to acceptance of foreign loans in this way, he said.

 Yechury also said that no national party is in a position to run or form the government in Delhi without support from the communists and the Left parties. This is very encouraging for the communists and the Leftists and we should now press for realising the long-standing demands from the Centre. We also force the Congress-led UPA government not to accept foreign loans with conditions set up by several agencies. On the other hand, we will set our own conditions for accepting such loans, he said.

 Yechury also said it was difficult to ignore globalisation and the economic reforms going on in different countries. But we have to keep in mind that acceptance of foreign loans, which is an outcome of the globalisation process, without any condition will destroy the economic sovereignty of our country. We have to set our own conditions for accepting such loans, otherwise the economic sovereignty of our country will be at stake, he added.

 Yechury wanted India to become an economic superpower by 2020 and for the purpose, we have to develop our human resources. In our country, 54 per cent of the population is below the age of 25 and we consider it our strength and not weakness, he said.

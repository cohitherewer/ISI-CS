 Admitted for toothache, woman dies in OT

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Howrah, April 23: Rikta Chakraborty, 42, who was admitted to a nursing home with toothache this morning, died an hour after being taken to the operation theatre.

 Police had to step in and rescue two doctors ? Sandip Khan, who performed the operation, and Amit Dey, the resident medical officer of the nursing home ? when an angry mob attacked them.

 ?We have detained the two doctors for questioning. A probe has begun,? said the additional superintendent of police (town), Laxmi Singh. Officials confirmed that a case under section 304 A of the IPC (death due to negligence) had been registered against the doctors.

 Rikta, a resident of Umesh Das Lane under Howrah police station, was admitted to the nursing home in Bantra with pain in a tooth about 15 minutes past noon.

 ?A doctor at the nursing home told us to arrange Rs 15,000 as my sister would have to undergo surgery immediately and we went to arrange the money. When we came back around 2 pm, a doctor told us that my sister was already in the operation theatre,? said Asit Chakraborty, her brother. 

 Around 2.30 pm, the family was told that Rikta had died in the OT, Asit said. 

 ?The doctors told us that my sister was to undergo a simple surgery to channel out the pus formed at the base of a tooth. They operated her without consulting us.?

 ?Something?s terribly wrong. The doctors repeatedly told us not to shift our patient to any other hospital as that would be ?disastrous? for her. Why did they conduct the surgery without our consent? If people start dying of toothaches, what is in store for this town?? asked Rikta?s nephew, Suman Banerjee.

 After the death was announced, her neighbours and family members raided the nursing home. When a large police force from nearby Bantra police station reached the spot, a scuffle broke out between the police and the mob. 

 ?Some 200 people raided the nursing home but we reined them in,? said a district police officer. ?We are looking for two other doctors. They were present when the woman was admitted.?

 Suicide at morning walk site

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, April 2: Apparently unable to cope with a relationship, 29-year-old Madan Das hanged himself from a tree in the Subhas Sarovar complex last night.

 Morning walkers saw the body hanging from the tree early this morning. Residents of the area were alerted and, around 6 am, Madan?s elder sister Dolly identified him. 

 This was almost 12 hours after he left home at 95 Suren Sarkar Road.

 G.D. Panda, the officer-in-charge of the Phoolbagan police station, said: ?Dolly has told us that for the past few months, Madan was troubled over his relationship with a woman of his locality. I think it was a situation he was unable to handle.?

 In a family of four ? including his widowed mother and brother, besides the sister ? Madan was the sole bread earner, working as a senior electrician in a private company. 

 Around six last evening, he returned home and had a chat with his mother. When he stepped out, almost immediately after that, Madan did not tell anyone in the family where he was going. 

 Late last night, when Madan failed to return home, relatives fanned out in search.

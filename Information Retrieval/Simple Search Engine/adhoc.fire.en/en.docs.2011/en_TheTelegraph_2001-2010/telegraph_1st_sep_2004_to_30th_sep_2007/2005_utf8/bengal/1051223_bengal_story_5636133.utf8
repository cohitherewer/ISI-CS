 Bose issues shut-up diktat

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 22: Left Front chairman Biman Bose today asked smaller partners of the coalition not to criticise the CPM in public ahead of next years Assembly elections. 

 At a meeting of the front partners, Bose, also a CPM leader, said if they had anything to say, they should discuss them within the front. 

 Difference of opinion should be resolved through talks. There should not be mudslinging, Bose said. 

 The CPI, Forward Bloc and the RSP had recently criticised the CPM for approving taking away farmland for industry. If their land is taken away, what will happen to farmers? Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh had asked. The RSPs Debabrata Bandopadhyay had slammed the CPM for keeping allies in the dark about the governments industry policy. 

 Bose today said time was rife to mobilise workers rather than bicker about internal differences. We should all ensure that every voter has his name on the voters list.

 On Mamata Banerjees anti-CPM platform, Paschimbanga Ganatantrik Front, Bose said: We are not scared, we have contact with the masses.

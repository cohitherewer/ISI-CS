 Crash kills 5 sleuths

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

North Dinajpur, May 21: Five officials from 

the Central Enforcement Directorate returning to Calcutta after conducting a departmental 

inquiry in Jalpaiguri and their driver were killed in an accident last night.

 The officials and the driver of a Toyota Qualis they had hired to reach Calcutta from Jaigaon in Jalpaiguri were killed when the vehicle collided with a truck in Bilaspur, about 425 km from Calcutta. Eight officials, who had left Calcutta on May 16 for the probe, were in the car.

 Police said the deceased ? all residents of Calcutta ? were identified as Sushobhan Dutta, 48, Ashok Mohanty, 47, Saroj Kumar Guin, 46, Tapan Kumar Dutta, 50, and Ashutosh Ghosh, 51. The driver was identified as Mohammed Shami, 42.

 The mishap took place on National Highway-34 when the vehicle in which the officials were travelling tried to overtake the truck. 

 Two other vehicles, unable to control their speed, hit the officials car from behind. Two persons in these vehicles were seriously injured and have been admitted to Raigunj Hospital.

 Ashok Kumar Dutta, superintendent of North Dinajpur, said: We came to know of the identity of the deceased from their identity cards. The bodies have been sent for post-mortem. Their Calcutta offices have also been informed.

 Debabrata Roy, a Directorate official who was injured and is undergoing treatment at Raigunj Hospital, said: All I can remember is that the driver wanted to overtake the truck standing on the way but hit it instead. I lost consciousness, and when I came back to my senses, I found myself on the hospital bed.

 Calcutta, May 15: Barely 

 48 hours before the last date of filing nominations, the 

 state Congress brass failed to pick their candidates for 

 the elections to the city civic body.

 Out of 94 wards that the Congress has decided to contest, state party president Pranab Mukherjee named candidates for 89. He could not resolve the impasse over the five seats for which there are several aspirants. 

 We shall soon announce the names of the five candidates, who will fight the polls on our symbol, Mukherjee told a news conference at the Pradesh Congress office this afternoon. 

 Earlier, he was roughed up and his clothes torn off by over 500 Congress workers and supporters protesting against the allocation of ward 55 to a candidate of mayor Subrata Mukherjees Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha.

 State CPM secretary Anil Biswas said in Delhi todays free-for-all in the Congress office over seat sharing with the mayors Mancha was indicative of more trouble for the people if the jot (alliance) was voted to power. 

 Congress sources said the delay in choosing nominees for the wards in the Manicktala area of east Calcutta was because of resentment of party supporters opposed to the leaderships surrender to Paresh Pal, the Trinamul Congress MLA from the area, now with Subrata Mukherjee. 

 Why should Pal, who has just switched over to the mayors Mancha, be offered five wards so that his candidates can enter the fray with hand symbol? Pal is still a Trinamul MLA and has not yet rejoined the Congress, said a senior Congress leader.

 Jayanta Bhattacharya, a Trinamul-backed Independent MP and a close aide of former state Congress chief Somen Mitra, alleged that the leadership would cause harm to the party organisation if it surrenders the five key seats to Pal. 

 The discontent in the party ranks was apparent in other wards as well. Party functionaries in wards 55 and 63 said they will not campaign as the seats had been offered to the Mancha. We have a considerable base in both the wards, in east and central Calcutta. It is wrong to offer them to Subrata, said a party leader who did not want to be named.

 He also alleged that the Mancha was indirectly helping the CPM by putting up weak nominees. A pushover Ramen Pandey, a Subrata aide, has been fielded against Ajit Panja, a former central minister and a two-time MP from Calcutta North East. The CPM candidate will have a cakewalk.

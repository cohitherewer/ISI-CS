 Lonely man takes own life

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Oct. 15: Almost 10 hours after he went missing, the body of Prasanta Kumar Sen was found floating in Rabindra Sarovar this morning. 

 A 52-year-old retired bank officer and a bachelor, Sen was staying with his brother and seems to have succumbed to his fear of a frightfully lonely life at this age, police officers investigating the case said. 

 After speaking to family members, it appears that Sen could not accept the fact that he and his brother would have to live all by themselves in their sprawling house after the latters son and daughter left, said a senior officer of the Lake police station.

 The fact that Sen had attempted suicide several times suggests that the victim was not at peace with him- self and had something nagging him, the police official said.

 Sen, who retired almost five years ago, used to stay with his brother Sushanta at their Sarat Bose Road house with his nephew Suhrit and niece Saon. 

 After retiring, Sen would go out almost everyday to meet acquaintances and friends while his brother, nearing retirement, left for office. 

 With Suhrit away studying engineering at Rourkela, the only one other person in the house was niece Saon. 

 A software professional with her husband away in the US, Saon was planning to join him there and this meant the two brothers would be left by themselves with no one at home, the officer of Lake police station added. 

 Going by his suicide note, the police said Sen had left his house on three occasions in the past.

 On Friday afternoon he left home again and when he did not return till 9 pm, Saon lodged a missing diary at Ballygunge police station. This morning, around 10, policemen on duty spotted a body floating in the Rabindra Sarovar lake. 

 The body has been sent for post-mortem.

 Last month, 72-year-old Sita Roy from Rahara was found on a pavement near Maulana Azad College. 

 Sita said she felt unwanted in the families of her two sons and so had left home.

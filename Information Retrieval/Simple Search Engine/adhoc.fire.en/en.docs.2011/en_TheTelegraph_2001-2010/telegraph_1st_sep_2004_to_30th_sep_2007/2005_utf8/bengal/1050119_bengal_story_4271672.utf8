 RDX near fence 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Jan. 18: Border Security Force jawans last night recovered explosives, including RDX and power gel sticks, automatic pistols and ammunition from a village in the Lalgola area of Murshidabad, close to the Bangladesh border.

 G.K. Sharma, the BSF deputy inspector-general of the Behrampore sector, said two jawans were patrolling the area, about 240 km from Calcutta, when two men were spotted with bundles on their head and moving towards the border. ?Being challenged, the two left the bundles behind and ran into Bangladesh,? said Sharma.

 The jawans recovered the cache from the bundles. There were 325 grams of RDX, 47 electronic detonators, two automatic pistols and other ammunition. The border force has deposited the seized items with police and lodged an FIR.

 A BSF officer said camps run by Indian militants in the neighbouring country could have been the destination for the arms. Several key United Liberation Front of Asom leaders are said to have taken shelter in Bangladesh. ?We have information about smuggling of explosives and arms to Bangladesh for use by militant outfits active in Bengal,? said the officer.

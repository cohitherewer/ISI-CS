 Self-help sermon to colleges

 - Schools and beyond, it is time to shed old methods to stay in tune

 MITA MUKHERJEE

 A pond or a pisciculture lab?

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: State-aided colleges have been asked to earn money through market-savvy projects that also involve social service.

 For instance, if a college has a pond on its campus, its students and teachers can start a fishery scheme. Or, the college can lease it out to an institution interested in pisciculture research.

 Similarly, a college can, with central or state aid, carry out a project for arsenic-free water jointly with the local municipality or panchayat.

 Two things are involved here. On one hand, assets like large tracts of land, ponds, classrooms, laboratories or buildings under control of the colleges have remained idle, said Kalachand Saha, secretary of the state college principals council. On the other, the students and teachers seem to have no connection with the requirements of their surroundings. We thought, why not marry the two and put the institutions on the growth path?

 The colleges are free to choose any scheme they like, said Dilip Deb, member secretary, West Bengal Higher Education Council. But they have to be market-savvy.

 That is, the rural colleges must first find out how best they can commercially tap their assets. If they feel their locality needs the development scheme they have in mind, they can go ahead with it.

 Else, they can let out idle assets ? like fields or ponds ? to city colleges who are willing to pay for the opportunity to use them for a pilot agricultural project or a fishery scheme.

 The potential for social service, too, is vast. A college in a low-literacy area can start a literacy programme on its premises with funds raised by it or with help from other agencies. 

 Or, it can let out the premises to other institutions or agencies to run such a programme. Ditto for a programme aimed at curbing air pollution.

 Similarly, a college in Bankura may take up a project to improve the design of kanthas, a craft in which a few thousand families are engaged. The college will be free to tie up with business houses interested in the end products.

 Such programmes can even provide jobs to graduates from these colleges. If marketed well, they could even get the trade interested, Deb said.

 Circulars have been sent to some 340 colleges, nearly 300 of them in the districts, asking them to draw up such schemes, Deb said. Many have already submitted proposals.

 Students of several colleges have shown interest in laying roads in villages, Saha said. His college, Prabhu Jagatbandhu in Howrah, has already sent a team of 10 students to take part in the building of a 30-ft road in Alampur village.

 Its fun, and its a rare experience, said Paromita Chatterjee, second year BA student of the college.

 Our aim is threefold, Deb said. We want the colleges and their students and teachers to be less Calcutta-centric and play a direct role in bringing technology to rural Bengal. Also the colleges must ac- quire the skills to anticipate what the market wants.

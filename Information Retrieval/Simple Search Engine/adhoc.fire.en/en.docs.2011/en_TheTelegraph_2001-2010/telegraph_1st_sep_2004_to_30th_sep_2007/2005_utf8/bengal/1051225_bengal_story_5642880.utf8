 14-year affair ends in couple suicide

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 24: Unable to accept that their 14-year-long relationship would not lead to marriage, Urmila Roy and Badal Kundu committed suicide in Nadia.

 The two hanged themselves at Urmilas house at Bethuadahari, 130 km from Calcutta. Urmilas 70-year-old mother found their bodies this morning.

 Urmila, 31, had divorced her schoolteacher husband six months ago to marry Badal. But Badals wife Sangita refused to divorce him. 

 As Badal did not get his divorce, they realised it would not be easy for them to marry. So they took their own lives, said Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajshekharan.

 The bodies of both lovers bore injury marks on the face and hands. This has led the police to suspect that just before they committed suicide, Urmila and Badal had a fight.

 Neighbours heard them having a quarrel. It appears that Badal, 32, an electrical mechanic with a stable income, may not have wanted to commit suicide as he had a four-year-old daughter. But Urmila, who was childless, must have had a big fight with him as she had already divorced her husband. We think Badal and Urmila had a quarrel over the issue that led them to claw each others hands and face, the police officer said.

 The police claimed that the two were in love when they were graduation students at the Bethuadahari College but could not marry as the families opposed the match.

 Our preliminary investigation shows both maintained contact over the past years even after they married separately, a police officer said. Badal married five years ago and Urmila married three years ago.

 After her divorce, Urmila returned from her husbands home in Tehatta to Bethuadahari. Urmila thought now that she was divorced, Badal would do the same and they would be able to marry. She pressured Badal to go ahead with his divorce but Badal was helpless. Under these circumstances, tension between the two grew, Rajshekharan said.

 Sangita admitted that Badal had desperately wanted the divorce. But how could I accept it? We have a daughter. What will happen to her? she asked.

 She said Badal went missing yesterday. This morning, the police informed me about the suicides. I made a mistake by not agreeing to the divorce, Sangita said.

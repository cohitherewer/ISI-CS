 Scorcher sun claims five 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, June 1: The temperature soared to 42.5?C today as the heat that has scalded this district over the past two days claimed two more, taking the toll to five.

 Three women from the remote Bhutni island in the Manikchak police station area were working in a maize field yesterday when they fell unconscious. They were pronounced dead in hospital. In another part of the district, Samir Halder of Kadubari village in Gajole collapsed on the way to a hospital, where a relative had been admitted. Unis Sheikh, 50, died in Malda town, this afternoon. 

 A local councillor organised a yagna on the Ganga last night, but the rain gods did not listen to the prayers.

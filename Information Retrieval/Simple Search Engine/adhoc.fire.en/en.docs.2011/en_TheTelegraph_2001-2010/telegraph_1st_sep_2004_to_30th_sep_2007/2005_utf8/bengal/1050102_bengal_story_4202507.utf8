 Checking push in varsity

 MITA MUKHERJEE AND RANJAN LAHIRY

 Burdwan, Jan. 1: Burdwan University authorities are working on a scheme to upgrade its undergraduate examination system ? mainly by improving the standard of evaluation of answer scripts.

 The move follows measures taken by Calcutta University to streamline the evaluation process.

 Burdwan University has, for the first time, decided to identify teachers who do not participate in evaluation. The varsity will then direct the principals and presidents of governing bodies of all its affiliated colleges to take action against these teachers.

 ?If we are to restructure our examination system, we need to ensure that the evaluation process does not get delayed and is also free of mistakes. To do this, we must ensure that all the teachers working in our affiliated colleges are participating in the evaluation process,? said Bipadtaran Ghosh, the controller of examinations of Burdwan University.

 The publication of results gets delayed every year and mistakes also occur in marksheets because of a dearth of examiners, Burdwan University found after a survey. A section of teachers who are enlisted examiners do not respond to their assignments and do not collect the answer scripts allotted to them for correction from their respective head examiners, it revealed.

 Officials said it is mandatory for all teachers working in undergraduate colleges affiliated to the university to examine answer scripts of all undergraduate examinations. Most examiners are assigned to examine answer scripts of all these examinations every year. But there is a large section, estimated to be about a few hundred, who do not respond to the assignments.

 ?We have started an exercise to locate these examiners. Once we are able to identify them, we will write to the principals and governing bodies to take action,? said Ghosh. The punishment can range from issuing of show-cause notices to suspension and even stopping of increments.

 Varsity officials said the quality of evaluation also deteriorates if teachers are unwilling to examine scripts.

 ?When teachers do not collect the answer scripts allotted to them, the head examiners have no option but to get the backlog cleared by those who have already completed evaluating their share, to avoid further delay in publication of results. Mistakes occur and the standard of evaluation declines if teachers are given too many scripts,? an official said.

 Ideally, a teacher of the undergraduate level should not examine more than 250 to 350 scripts in a year. However, on an average, most teachers examine more than 700 scripts a year.

 Calcutta, Dec. 26: Dacoits looted passengers on the Howrah-Malda Intercity Express in Birbhum this evening 

 A railway police officer at Sainthia, 240 km from Calcutta, said rob-bers who were already in the train pulled the emergency chain to let others climb up. Two of them held revolvers on the drivers head so that he could not contact the control-room over the wireless set that they are now equipped with. The dacoits took away Rs 3 lakh from Bidyut Saha, a businessman. The police said though some others were also looted, the target was specific.

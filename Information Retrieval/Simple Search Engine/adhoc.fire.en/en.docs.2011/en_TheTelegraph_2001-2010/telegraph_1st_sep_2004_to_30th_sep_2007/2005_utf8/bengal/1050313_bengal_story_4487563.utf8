 Courts in idle funds trap

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 12: Funds 

 for setting up 31 fast-track courts will be returned to 

 the Centre this month as the state has not been able to 

 either provide courtrooms or appoint judges.

 The return of the funds comes at a time when the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is determined to place in the budget session of the Assembly the Block-level Pre-litigation Conciliation Board Bill or the Salishi Bill.

 All states other than Bengal are reported to have fully utilised the central funds. Bengal has, by not utilising the funds, also forfeited its claim of setting up 50 such courts in the next financial year.

 Three years ago, the Centre had decided to establish more than 1,700 fast-track courts across the country for quick disposal of cases. The Union government asked Bengal to provide infrastructure for setting up 108 such courts in the first phase. However, the state has till date set up only 77 such courts.

 The West Bengal Bar Council, which has been opposing the move to establish block-level conciliation boards to settle petty legal disputes, has come down heavily on the government for its failure to set up fast-track courts.

 ?Law minister Nisith Adhikari says his government wants to decrease the workload on the courts and is defending the enactment of a new legislation to create block-level conciliation boards for this purpose. But lakhs of cases pending in the lower courts could be easily disposed of if new fast-track courts are set up. However, the state government is not taking any step in this regard,? claimed the chairman of the bar council, Sanatan Mukherjee.

 ?It is apparent that the state government is more interested in introducing the pre-litigation bill to fulfil its political agenda than in clearing the backlog of cases in lower courts,? he said today.

 Mukherjee said 207 posts of judges are lying vacant in 568 courts in the state. ?As a result, more than 11,00,000 cases have piled up in subordinate courts,? he said.

 Several posts of additional sessions judge ? the lowest rank for fast-track court judges ? are lying vacant. However, the government is not in a position to promote magistrates to these posts because it will create a void in the lower courts with the state lacking funds to appoint new magistrates.

 ?In December, a panel was formed to recruit 193 new magistrates across the state. But surprisingly, the government is not taking any initiative to appoint any new magistrates,? claimed Saradindu Biswas, a former chairman of the bar council.

 An official of the state judiciary department said the finance department had not sanctioned the appointments because of scarcity of funds. ?Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, however, has promised to allocate enough funds for the purpose in the budget for the coming financial year,? said the officer.

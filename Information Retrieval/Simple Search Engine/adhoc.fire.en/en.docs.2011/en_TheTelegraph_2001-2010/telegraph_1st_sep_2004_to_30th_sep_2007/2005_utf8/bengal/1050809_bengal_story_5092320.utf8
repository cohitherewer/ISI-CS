 Pranab stays with his team

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi/Calcutta, Aug. 8: As expected, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee will continue as the state Congress president in the run-up to next years Assembly elections.

 The AICC also appointed Pradip Bhattacharya as working president in a replay of what had happened between 1989 and 99. During that period, while A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury held the top post in the state party unit, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi served as the working president.

 We have received the fax message from AICC this afternoon on Pranabdas re-appointment as PCC chief. Now a clear directive from the high command has reached us to reorganise the party from the grassroots, said Bhattacharya.

 He said an executive committee meeting would be convened shortly to revamp the core body by inducting key party functionaries. I will talk to Pranabda in a day or two to discuss the matter.

 AICC sources said Mukherjee was re-appointed to stem dissent within the party. 

 There would have been resentment if someone else was chosen PCC chief. In fact, there is no alternative to Mukherjee, said a source in the AICC. 

 However, a section of Congress leaders today resented Mukherjees continuation as the party chief. They said the decision would further expose the beleaguered organisation before the masses.

 Pranabda is busy placating the CPM in Delhi so that the latter continues to support the UPA government. How is it possible for the same person to speak against the CPM in Bengal? asked a Congress MLA.

 Graf fan eyes top 25

 SUBHAJIT BANERJEE

 Siliguri, Feb. 19: Sania Mirza today achieved off-court a task tougher than beating Venus Williams on it ? she upstaged Sourav Ganguly in what the cricket captain calls his second home.

 The tennis sensation brought the crowd to its feet at the Kanchenjunga stadium where the tsunami auction was held. She enthralled kids at the Himalayan Tennis Academy. And she kept her cool throughout the madness that surrounded her.

 At the stadium, the loudest cheers were reserved for the girl from Hyderabad when the trio of Sourav, Sania and Bhaichung Bhutia took stage. On the dais, the Team India captain served as her constant companion and interpreter. ?Thank you all for being here,? was Sania?s message to the crowd. ?This is the least we can do to help the cause and thanks for supporting me,? she said.

 Earlier in the day, watching her daughter tackle the volley of questions, camera flashes and still try to carry on a conversation with the kids milling around her at the tennis academy, mother Naseema said: ?It?s a lot worse these days at other places.?

 A similar scene had been enacted earlier in the day. Sania had to launch into a press conference immediately on checking into Sinclairs.

 ?It?s great to be here for such a cause,? was the standard opening line. But soon, the focus was back on tennis. ?My aim is to break into the top 50 by the end of this year,? said Sania. The tennis star said she would aim for a top-25 ranking within the next two to three years, or rather ?as soon as possible?.

 What about the sudden fame and adulation? ?It?s good to be known and bring smiles to so many people?s faces,? offered the 18-year-old Steffi Graf fan. But she blasted a sudden comparison with Indira Gandhi: ?You really can?t do that.?

 Tight-lipped about the three endorsements she had signed, Sania ? who returns to the practice courts on Monday ? promised to put performance before product push: ?If I start losing, all this will disappear? I?m not here to be a model but to perform well in tennis, and I will never skip practice for a shoot.?

 At the Himalayan Tennis Academy opened in June in Dagapur, Sania finally got to set foot on a tennis court.

 ?The kids were in awe of Sania and her visit really pepped them up,? said academy coach Gaya Pallai, as soon as Sania?s convoy ? complete with police pilot cars ? had left after a round of autographs and photo-ops.

 By the time she and Sourav did a round of the Kanchenjunga stadium urging people to donate, it was game, set and match to Sania Mirza.

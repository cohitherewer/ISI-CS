 Cong poll

 Calcutta, June 6: The Congress will elect its state president tomorrow.

 In all likelihood, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee will get a second term as the Pradesh Congress Committee chief. At Netaji Subhas Institute Hall, members of the pradesh electioneering committee will have to raise hands to confirm their support. We shall convey our resolution to Soniaji after re-electing Pranabda, said Somen Mitra, who was once tipped to succeed him.

 Bar on schoolteacher in sari

 NARESH JANA

 Midnapore, July 17: A teacher is yet again facing the wrath of school authorities for not adhering to a dress code. This time, despite going to take class in a sari.

 Debasree Jana of Ratulia High School at Panskura has been showcaused and is not being allowed to sign the attendance register for not wearing the school-stipulated white sari with a green border. 

 The government had earlier assured teachers that schools would not impose a dress code on them if they were dressed decently. 

 The school education department has also deleted a clause in the recently released code of conduct for teachers that empowered schools to follow a code of dressing. 

 Last October, Aparna Sarkar, the zoology teacher of Hiralal Balika Vidyalaya at Maldas Bamungola told police that two of her senior lady colleagues attacked her with umbrellas because she was wearing a salwar-kameez in school. 

 In Murshidabads Naoda last April, Susmita Mondal, who converted to Islam at the time of her marriage, was told by senior teachers and the school administration to follow tradition when she took class in a burqa. 

 The headmistress of a school in north Calcutta also debarred a group of teachers from taking classes for wearing lipstick and bindi.

 We are looking into Debasree Janas allegation, said a leader of the CPM-controlled teachers body in Calcutta. 

 However, the coeducational school at Panskura, about 160 km from Calcutta, is still sticking to a dress code for its 21 male and female teachers. The men have to wear white shirts and trousers.

 Debasree, who joined the school six years ago as a biology teacher, said it was imposed three years ago. Some of us had protested against it, but to no avail. During the last summer vacation, she came to know that school education minister Kanti Biswas had said there was no dress code for teachers. On July 4, when the school reopened, Debasree wore an ordinary sari to work. 

 Headmaster Swapan Bhattacharya told her she would not be allowed to sign the register. He said: She must abide by the rule. There is a possibility that the students might not agree to wear the uniform if the teachers themselves flout the code.

 Debasree had informed Jagadish Maity, the East Midnapore inspector of schools, about the dress dispute. He said: Going by government instructions, schools should not force teachers to follow such a code. I have informed the school concerned to act accordingly.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, June 27: Mamata Banerjee may be shunning the Congress, but her party isnt. 

 Trinamul Congresss Shakti Roy Chowdhury was today elected chairman of Baruipur municipality with support from the lone Congress councillor in the 17-member board. In the May 22 elections, Trinamul bagged eight seats, the CPM seven and the RSP and the Congress one each. Roy Chowdhury was not scared of disciplinary action. His party had also run the earlier board, but on its own, with 10 councillors.

 Krishnagar: Rabind-ranath Roy, a retired army jawan, chopped off a hand of his brothers wife and injured him and his 16-year-old daughter ? all for a coconut that dropped on a disputed plot on Sunday. Police said the resident of Chakdah, 60 km from Calcutta, his wife and son are absconding. His brother Narendranaths family is in a Kalyani hospital.

Midnapore, Feb. 13: On the threshold of Kuldiha village, a hand-written signboard says ?pakhi dhora nishedh (catching birds prohibited)?.

 Inside Salboni forest in West Midnapore, about 160 km from Calcutta, the residents are far more conscious about their environment than many others across the state. And several thousands parrots, pigeons, sparrows, kingfishers, cormorant (pankaudi), mynahs and varieties of exotic birds sense the villagers? love for them. 

 For the past decade, the residents of Kuldiha have been protective about their neighbours and guests in the wild. Children are trained not to disturb the birds and the elders do not use chemical fertilisers or pesticides in their farms.

 Apart from their own crops, the villagers cultivate gram to feed the birds. 

 District forest officials are all praise for Kuldiha. ?This protection is of great help in preserving the ecology of the area. What they are doing is very important and we will render all sorts of support they might require,? said divisional forest officer Ratan Banerjee. 

 Kuldiha comprises 30 families, which cultivate paddy around monsoon and vegetables in winter. ?There was a time when the parrots used to destroy our vegetables. The same parrots are now feeding on the gram crop we grow. They do not touch the vegetables any more. We also scatter rice for them to eat,? said Jyotip Mahato, a resident. Mahato added that after the pigeons no longer feed on the standing crops. 

 ?The pigeons have come to know that we will feed them from our stock of rice. They don?t go to the field and stay in the village,? said Asit Mahato.

 During monsoon, white storks (bok) lay eggs atop trees. ?Some times, the new-born storks fall from the nests. We pick them up and put them back in the nest,? said Pintu Mahato. 

 Moreover, as the villagers do not use chemical fertilisers or pesticides, there are harmless creature like earthworm aplenty on which the birds feed.

 ?No one?s taught them how to take care of the birds, but they do it on their own. We tell our students to draw inspiration from them,? said Susanna Mandi, the headmistress of the local primary school.

 Race to meet HS result deadline

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 25: Several teachers? associations today assured the government of their cooperation to meet the June 10 deadline for the publication of HS results.

 The Supreme Court had fixed the deadline to ensure students across the country had their plus-II results in hand by a particular date. The order would immensely help those taking national-level tests to enter medical and engineering colleges. 

 The apex court also directed the boards to ensure the distribution of mark sheets by June 15.

 Ashoke Maity, the head of the Congress-dominated West Bengal Headmasters? Association, said: ?Though we are opposed to some of the government policies, we must cooperate with it to ensure the announcement of results by June 10. We must rise above politics for the greater good of students.? 

 Education minister Kanti Biswas was present at the meeting called by the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education to seek the teachers? help and discuss steps necessary to speed up the process.

 The meeting assumes importance as teachers, who would evaluate the answer scripts, play the most important part in the examination process.

 Over 400,000 students will sit for this year?s HS examinations, which begins on March 22. To meet the deadline, the council has to publish the results at least 45 days before it usually does. Last year, the results were announced on July 27.

 Mamata picks Tutu

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 30: Mamata Banerjee today nominated businessman Swapan Sadhan (better known as Tutu) Bose for the Rajya Sabha.

 The selection capped speculation over the Trinamul Congress candidate as there were several aspirants, including general secretary Mukul Roy, leader of the Opposition in the Assembly Pankaj Banerjee, chief whip Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay and legislator Saugata Roy. Former MPs Ajit Panja, Ranjit Panja and Krishna Bose are also believed to have been eyeing the slot. 

 Quiz-master Derek Briens name also did the rounds since his participation in the civic poll campaign. Today, he issued a statement saying he never aspired for the seat when he joined Trinamul and would continue to be with it and attend its rally on July 21. 

 Derek ruled out contesting the Assembly elections next year but made it clear that he would not mind entering the Upper House in the future. 

 Mamata described him as an asset to the party.

 Asked why she chose Bose, also the Mohun Bagan Athletic Club president, the Trina-mul chief said: We wanted to honour a person from the sports and media world.

 Party insiders said she had little option but to select someone from outside the party as there were too many contenders within.

 Bose said he has applied for Trinamul membership.

 MLA in custody

 OUR BUREAU

 Behrampore/Krishnagar, Sept. 10: Niamat Sheikh, the Congress-backed Independent MLA from Hariharpara in Murshidabad, was remanded in judicial custody till September 23 in connection with yesterdays attack on party worker Samiul Chowdhury in a clash of rival factions.

 Sheikh was arrested yesterday afternoon following a statement by Chowdhury who is admitted to the NRS Medical College and Hospital in Calcutta. Three other Congress workers, including the former chairman of the Behrampore municipality, Akbar Kabir are absconding.

 This is unfortunate. We have asked the district Congress president and party MP from Behrampore to probe the matter and submit a report at the earliest, said state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya.

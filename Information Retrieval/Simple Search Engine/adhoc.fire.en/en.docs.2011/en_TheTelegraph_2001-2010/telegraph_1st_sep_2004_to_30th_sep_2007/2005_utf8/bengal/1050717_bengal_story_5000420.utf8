 Shop fracas

 Calcutta, July 16: Trouble broke out at Sodepur on the northern fringes of the city this afternoon when armed men allegedly owing allegiance to the CPM beat up the owner of a garments outlet chain.

 A hunt was launched for the culprits and late in the evening a duo was arrested from Basirhat. Seven store employees had to be hospitalised with injuries. Police said around 2.30 pm, men who identified themselves as members of the CPM-affiliated bazaar committee threatened Nrityananda Aich, the owner, and asked him to stop renovation and expansion work in his shop. Your work is hampering movement into our party office, they said. When Aich tried to reason them, he was beaten up.

 CPM, not court, decides punishment for death

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE

 Asansol, June 21: Believe it or not, CPM leaders are now trying murder cases as well.

 A party committee here recently ordered a family to pay Rs 2.1 lakh as damages for the death of a youth ? a widows only son ? who was allegedly beaten up.

 A local doctor, Debapriya Roy, had ascribed the epileptic youths death to cardio-respiratory failure due to severe convulsive seizure but CPM leaders at Ismailpur, about 240 km from Calcutta, refused to accept his certificate. Somnath Mukherjee was beaten to death, they were convinced. And that was enough. 

 On June 17, the leaders discussed at the meeting what could be just compensation for the death. 

 We dont accept the death certificate. We know Somnath was beaten to death, said Samir Sengupta, a member of the CPMs Asansol-2 local committee, who was present at the meeting. 

 On June 13, Somnath, who was jobless and suffering from depression, apparently scaled the wall of a house, knocked on the door and sought a glass of water at 2 am. The family members took him for a thief and allegedly beat him up and handed him over to police. 

 The Hirapur police questioned Somnath and realised that he was going through a bout of depression. He did not go to the house with an intention to steal. So we sent him home to Ray Para, an officer said.

 The next day, my son complained of abdominal pain and started vomiting. I saw cigarette burns on his back. He told me he had been beaten up. I was supposed to take him to hospital when he suddenly started convulsing and died within minutes, said his mother Bina. 

 Roy issued the death certificate at 2 pm on June 14. ?.Somnath was suffering from epilepsy for a long period?. Cause of death: cardio-respiratory failure due to severe convulsive seizure. He did not find any external injury marks.

 But Bina went to the CPM office and alleged that her son was murdered and held the occupants of the house, where he had gone for the water, responsible. Instead of guiding her to the police, the leaders called the shalishi meeting at a local club. 

 Scared, the accused family members did not want to be named or quoted. However, a family friend said they did not kill any one. We dont know whether we should pay the money, go to police or move court. 

 District superintendent of police Niraj Singh has sought a report from Hirapur. When the youth was released, he was not in a condition that could have led to death. Our officers did not find any serious injury marks on him. We also have not received a formal complaint, he said.

 The district party leadership is annoyed over the local leaders role. Our leaders should not involve themselves in a shalishi to handle murder charges. It is the jurisdiction of the police and the judiciary. We will probe the incident but the young mans mother should go to the police, said Bamapada Mukherjee, a district secretariat member. 

 Sengupta was unfazed. On the basis of the widows complaint, we tried to settle the matter among ourselves as the legal procedure is very lengthy and expensive nowadays?. If such matters can be solved locally, what is the need for knocking the doors of the police or courts?

 US funds for quartet

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, April 20: Four 

 civic bodies in the state ? Siliguri, Jalpaiguri, Asansol 

 and Durgapur ? will receive financial and technological 

 assistance from the US to strengthen urban infrastructure 

 and improve financial administration. 

 They will receive the funds as part of the Indo-USAID programme. Under the programme, $125 million has been provided for different projects in the country to be completed within 30 years from 1994. Funds to the states concerned are being routed through the Centre. 

 ?The pilot project for Bengal under this programme will be launched on April 26 in Calcutta,? municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said here today. 

 He was inaugurating an auditorium built by the Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority and the Durgapur Municipal Corporation. 

 ?With technical and financial assistance from the US, the social, urban and financial systems of the four civic bodies will be developed,? Bhattacharya said. 

 ?Solid waste management, geographical information system management, municipal accounting system and efficiency will receive a boost under this programme in Siliguri, Jalpaiguri, Asansol and Durgapur ? four of the most prominent and upcoming urban areas outside Calcutta. Industrial and urban growth has been rapid in these areas, turning them into major (investment) destinations.? 

 ?Solid waste management will be undertaken in a scientific manner involving land-filling, generation of bio-fertilisers and power generation. Proper utilisation of waste is urgently required in our state as we do not have enough land to dump it,? he added. 

 The minister felt that US technology would help develop the geographical information system in the four towns using the Internet. ?Anyone can get every relevant geographical information about the civic areas, sitting in front of a computer.? 

 ?The municipal staff, too, will undergo training for faster delivery of services under the efficiency-increasing programme,? a government official said.

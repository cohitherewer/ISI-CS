 March date for split HS

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 16: The first centralised examinations for Class XI students will start on March 4.

 The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education announced the date today, months after it split the higher secondary course into two. The Class XII exams are also held around the same time.

 More than four lakh students of Class XI in 3,000-odd schools across the state will answer questions set by the council. Till this year, it was the responsibility of schools to prepare question papers.

 This is the first time in the last 29 years that the council will hold two major examinations ? the newly-introduced Class XI exam and the normal higher secondary tests ? around the same time. We are working overtime to ensure that the two exams are held smoothly, Gopa Dutta, the council president, said.

 In August, the council, in a bid to restructure the higher secondary course in tune with a uniform system followed by boards across the country, had broken the higher secondary syllabus into two. That meant the higher secondary examinations would be held only on the basis of the Class XII syllabus.

 According to Dutta, with the implementation of the new system, the volume of exam-related work would almost double. From next year, the examiners will have to check answer scripts of two sets of examinations, Madhyamik and higher secondary. 

 To cope with the burden, the council will adopt a string of measures.

 For instance, it has decided to meet over 23,000 examiners across the state in phases to train them on tackling the load. Till last year, it held meetings with only head-examiners.

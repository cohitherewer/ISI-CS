 Rain blows in with Pak wind 

 Calcutta, Jan. 10: An unseasonal shower drenched the city and its neighbourhood tonight.

 Weathermen said the rain was a result of a sudden flow of moisture-laden wind from north-west India. During this part of the year, moisture-bearing wind from the Mediterranean Sea travels to Afghanistan, Pakistan and Kashmir, leading to rain and snow there. Known in the meteorologists? parlance as the ?western disturbance?, this wind travels down to Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and moves in a east-Northeast direction. 

 An official said: ?This evening, we found the western disturbance over Calcutta.?

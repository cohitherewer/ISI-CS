 CPM ?special? on Congress

 - Activity week for foes-turned-friends

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan 7: In a changed political scenario, the CPM looks set to incorporate a special chapter on its relations with the Congress in its draft resolution at the party?s central committee meeting beginning here tomorrow.

 At the three-day meet, insiders said, the party is also likely to explore the possibility of reviving the third front at the national level and maintaining equi-distance from both the Congress and the BJP. 

 After its ratification by the central committee, the draft resolution will be referred to the 18th party congress, to be held in Delhi in April.

 After having lent its support to the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance at the Centre for the past eight months, the CPM realises that some of its policies are similar to those of the BJP-led NDA. 

 However, the CPM is opposed to using any ?harsh words or posing any threat to the UPA government? in its draft resolution. 

 During the 17th party congress in Hyderabad, held in March 2002, the CPM had said: ??The Congress stands for the same economic policies that it had initiated in 1991 (Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was then the finance minister)?There is no difference with the BJP on basic economic policies. Given its class character, the CPM cannot have an alliance or (a) united front with the Congress.? 

 In the given situation, the party resolution taken two years ago had said, ?the BJP and its allies are the main targets and the CPM should adopt tactics that will enable all secular and democratic forces to thwart the game plan of the BJP-RSS combine?.

 The BJP is no longer in power in Delhi and observers feel that the CPM will naturally have to change its stand on the Congress. In its special chapter on the Congress, the party is likely to highlight the central government?s failures and achievements in eight months. 

 The Centre?s decision to scrap the Prevention of Terrorism Act is likely to come in for praise along with the dismantling of the disinvestment ministry and the introduction of the food-for-work programme in about 160 districts, including six in Bengal. The party, however, is not happy with the move to appoint a panel that will consider the share prices of public sector undertakings.

Party seat

 The North 24-Parganas unit of the CPM today inducted transport minister Subhas Chakraborty?s wife Romola in the district panel. She was, however, denied berth in the Dum Dum zonal committee, reportedly following opposition from MP Amitabha Nandy?s camp.

 Surgery OK, but patient dead

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Calcutta, Sept. 3: A medical negligence case was lodged against a private hospital after relatives of a 52-year-old woman found her dead in the intensive care unit.

 Sudipta Deb Mallick, the wife of a retired college principal, was admitted at AMRI Hospitals on August 27 for a surgery on her tongue. Two days after the operation, she was found dead in the ICU, where she had been shifted for better care. 

 Her son Sujit has lodged a complaint with the Lake police station alleging that negligence of the hospital authorities resulted in the death. 

 Family members said the hospital did not inform them after Mallick, a resident of Salt Lake, died. We saw her lying in a pool of blood on the bed when we went to the ICU during visiting hours. When we asked the nurses, no one could tell us about the circumstances leading to her death, said the womans son-in-law, Tirthankar Dutta.

 Sujit said in the complaint Sudiptas condition was stable after the surgery. 

 On Wednesday, doctors told us that she was fine and advised us to shift her to a general bed. We came to the hospital around 3.30 pm, two hours before the scheduled visiting hours and enquired about her health. We were again assured that she was fine and was being shifted to a general ward from the ICU. 

 Around 5 pm, we went to the general ward and did not find her. On enquiry, we were told that she was still in the ICU because the bed was not ready, Sujit said.

 The relatives then went to the ICU and saw her lying dead. Sujit alleged: She was lying in blood. Not a single doctor or nurse was there near the bed. Even after our repeated requests, no one was able to tell us when and how she died. 

 Only after we lodged a complaint and the police came to inquire, the authorities said she died around 4.50 pm. But we were in the hospital lobby on the ground floor 3 pm onwards? no one told us about it.

 Gautam Mukherjee, who was treating Sudipta, said the operation went off well. It was successful and she was recovering well. We had shifted her to the ICU for proper care, Mukherjee said. 

 S.B. Purakayastha, president, AMRI hospitals, said: She died of cardiac arrest. Doctors tried their level best, but all efforts proved futile.

 He denied the charge that Sudiptas family had not been informed on time. 

 The moment doctors found that she had suffered a cardiac arrest, they tried their best to save her. We were taking time before declaring her dead, Purakayastha said.

 Officers of the Lake police station said they would seek medical opinion and then proceed with the probe. Once the medical opinion is available, the police will seek clearance from the government before pressing formal charges against the hospital.

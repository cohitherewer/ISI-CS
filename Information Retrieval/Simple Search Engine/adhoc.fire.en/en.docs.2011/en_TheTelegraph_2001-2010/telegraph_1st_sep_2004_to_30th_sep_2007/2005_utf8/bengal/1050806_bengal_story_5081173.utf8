 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Aug. 5: Justice P.N. Sinha of the high court today directed the Birbhum police chief to appear before him and explain why a case diary relating to the murder of nine people by alleged CPM activists in 1981 was not available with police. 

 Earlier, Sinha had asked the officer to produce the case diary. He said it was not there as the investigating officer had retired and his whereabouts were not known. The court was hearing a petition by Anowara Biwi, who lost her four sons in the attack.

 Calcutta: Trinamuls Saugata Roy has been appointed chairman of the Assemblys public accounts committee. It oversees the governments income and expenditure.

 Behrampore: Khukumani Mondal, 38, a health worker here, was found dead in her bedroom with her throat slit. She was associated with a health centre about 200 km from Calcutta.

 Liquor permit hits court bar

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 4: The state government?s move to open more liquor shops received a jolt today when a vacation bench of Calcutta High Court passed an interim stay order restraining it from conducting a lottery tomorrow for distribution of licences.

 Justice Pranab Kumar Chatterjee, however, allowed the government to continue accepting applications for licences. The government had decided to open 1,000 off-shops across the state and had invited licence applications. 

 Today?s order came in response to a petition by the West Bengal Liquor Shops Licensees Association challenging the validity of the government?s notification inviting applications for licences. 

 The association?s lawyer, Subodh Ukil, argued that the government?s decision to open a liquor shop for every 18,000 of the state population was wrong. ?Among the 18,000 people, there are those who do not drink and also children. So, the idea of the government to provide a liquor shop for every 18,000 of the population is unjustified,? he said.

 Ukil also said the government?s notice seeking applications was contrary to excise rules. ?Some of the district collectors have already sent written objections on the government?s decision. But, it (the government) does not bother to listen to their objections,? he said.

 Shyamal Ganguly, the state?s counsel, tried to convince the court saying that the government has a noble intention behind this decision. ?The government is trying to stop sale of spurious liquor. Every year, hundreds of people die in the state by consuming illicit liquor. If more licensed shops are allowed to open, the sale of spurious liquor will stop,? he said. 

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government also faced flak from a Left partner on the liquor licences. Forward Bloc chairman and agriculture minister Kamal Guha today announced that his party will take to the streets to thwart the government?s move to issue new licences. Guha and party state secretary Ashok Ghosh also imposed an alcohol ban on party members.

 ?We will expel any member found consuming alcohol. I will not even spare my son if I find him drinking alcohol,? Guha said. 

 He announced that party functionaries in Cooch Behar would hold demonstrations in front of the district magistrate?s office on January 15. Asked how they would oppose the decision of a government in which his party is a constituent, Guha said: ?Let the government do whatever it likes. But, we will carry on opposing the government decision on liquor licences.?

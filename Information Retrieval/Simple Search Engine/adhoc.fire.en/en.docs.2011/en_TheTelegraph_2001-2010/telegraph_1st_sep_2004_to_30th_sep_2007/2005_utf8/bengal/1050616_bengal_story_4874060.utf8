 Night vigil at ports

 Calcutta, June 15: The Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) wants to resume night navigation of ships and vessels to and from the city and Haldia after over 30 years, says a staff reporter. 

 Thanks to regular theft of shore lights and buoy lights between Diamond Harbour and the Sandheads, night vigil had become impossible since the 1970s. 

 CPT chairman Anup Chanda met transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, home secretary Amit Kiran Deb and police officials today to discuss the problem.

 The CPT has purchased 50 of the 100 lights needed to illuminate the stretch from Sagar Island to Diamond Harbour, but they want an assurance that once installed, the lights would be secure from thieves.

 Property link to witch killing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 21: Three years ago, when 65-year-old Brihoshpoti Sardar died in Chunakhali, the word spread that the lady had succumbed to her failing health. Even police, probing a complaint by Sardars son, said the death in the small pocket in the southern extreme of the city was because of natural causes. 

 However, a few days ago the Criminal Investigation Department found that on a May evening in 2002 the mother of two was murdered brutally and then buried by a few who eyed her property and wanted to pass her off as a witch.

 Two persons have been arrested in connection with the case that was earlier written off by the district police. Narayan Sardar was taken into custody from Nazet in South 24-Parganas last week and Lodho Sardar from Dankuni.

 Soon after the CID started the probe, we located the body and exhumed it. Samples were then sent for a forensic examination and, once the reports revealed the death was homicidal in nature, the case took a new turn, said D.P. Tarenia, the inspector-general of police, CID.

 The arrests have come as a moral victory for Brihoshpotis son Prafulla who has been persistent in his quest for the truth behind his mothers death.

 Prafulla refused to buy the Canning polices version that the death was a natural one. In January 2003, he lodged a court complaint seeking a fresh investigation. A year later, the CID was entrusted with the job after the court concluded that the police report was flawed and started a probe in September 2004.

 Investigations revealed that on the fateful evening, Brihoshpoti was hurrying back with two others ? after listening to kirtan ? to attend to her ailing husband Biswanath. Suddenly, a group of men blocked their path and made the others leave. They then beat her up, tried to gag her and hit her on the head from behind. The body was thrown into a pond nearby, said an investigating officer.

 Among those who allegedly masterminded the death were Narayan Sardar, who wielded influence in the area and Lodho Sardar alias Tara.

 Tarenia claimed that Narayan had been eyeing Brihoshpotis property for some time and, when all his efforts to acquire it failed, he spread the word that the lady was a witch and was responsible for the sudden death of one of the girls of the locality.

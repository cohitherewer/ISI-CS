 Cop in dock for change-of-guard campaign

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Katwa, May 22: As curtains came down on Round-I of the civic polls, a police station officer-in-charge found himself in the centre of a raging controversy. Not for the first time, though.

 Katwa OC Madhab Mandal is facing probe for having performed in a 40-minute video CD comprising four songs and recitations imploring voters to change guard in the municipality here, about 180 km from Calcutta, run by the Congress for a decade. Local channels had aired the film around mid-May. 

 The titles described Mandal as the lyricist-composer. In the opening scene, the officer, in plainclothes, was seen helping little girls on bicycles. The camera then shifted to a scene of violence where bombs were being hurled indiscriminately at a spot off Katwa bus stand, triggering panic. 

 With Mandals song playing in the background, the video showed a neta sitting on a throne and a pop-up said: This man is responsible for all this. 

 The message was not hard to miss ? it is the responsibility of the people to do away with such netas and bring about a change. The songs, too, urged the people to elect new leaders to the municipal board. 

 Hariyey gachhey shob kichhu, bujhey nao ke tomar korchhey kshoti (Everythings lost, try to understand who is causing you harm), said one of the songs.

 Taking it for a campaign for the CPM, the local MLA and Rabindranath Chatterjee, the chairman of the municipality, lodged complaints with the subdivisional officer. Mandal was accused of violating the code of election conduct. 

 Burdwan district magistrate Subrata Gupta said a ban was imposed on the telecast after the complaints were lodged and the officer was questioned about it. 

 The OC told us he knew nothing about it. So, we asked him to lodge an FIR, said Gupta. The FIR, though, is yet to be lodged.

 Mandal refused to speak. I have been asked not to speak to the media. My superiors will do so, he said. 

 Three months ago, he had tried to play moral police to young lovers. Last month, Mandal was seen parading alleged dacoits in the town, cautioning residents against them.

 Inspector-general Anil Kumar said: I have sought a report on the activities of the officer from the district superintendent of police.

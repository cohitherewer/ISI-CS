 Water tax in pipeline

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, June 29: With costs flowing out of control, the Public Health Engineering (PHE) department is working on a strategy to raise funds through water tax.

 The department has 900 water supply schemes in areas outside the jurisdiction of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority. It not only provides filtered water through pipelines but also has a number of deep tube-wells. 

 We annually spend around Rs 10 crore for operation and maintenance of various water supply schemes. But a major portion of it is exhausted in paying electricity bills and salary of employees. A meagre sum is collected as tax. As a result, we have to provide a hefty amount as subsidy, PHE secretary Asim Burman said this afternoon. 

 Against this backdrop, we are collecting opinions from experts and economists to formulate a revised tax structure and build a system for collection of tax. The move is aimed at covering at least 75 per cent of the operation and maintenance costs, he added.

 According to officials, the government has taken a policy decision to impose water tax across the state and a few municipal corporations have already put it into operation.

 Though we have imposed water tax in some districts, the collection is very poor ?between Rs 30 and Rs 40 per connection every day. We have to impose a fixed and reasonable tax structure. If we fail to raise funds, we may have to close down the schemes as the government will stop providing subsidies, said chief engineer Prabir Dutta.

 Boy pick-up probe waits

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chinsurah, Oct. 30: A minister accused of murder might roam free, not a petty criminal. So, if he is absconding, his 10-year-old child might be held back in the lock-up. 

 The probe into the unlawful detention of Raja Kabiraj, a boy too young to be even aware of his fathers alleged wrongdoings, has to wait for a written complaint. We will initiate an inquiry only after getting a written complaint from the boys family or someone else, said Nanda Kumar Biswas, the Burdwan range deputy inspector-general of police. 

 Biswas added that he had asked the Hooghly superintendent of police ? Raja was detained in Singur police station in the district ? to look into the matter. I am sure the SP is finding out the details. But we are yet to receive any formal complaint. 

 He admitted that according to the law, a minor who is innocent can never be brought to the police station and kept in confinement. This is a grave offence, Biswas said.

 The Singur police were searching for Mantu Kabiraj in connection with a robbery. When they did not find him, they picked up his son last Thursday. He was in custody until last evening.

 Rajas aunt Ujjala Kabiraj had said that the police had raided her house at Lichubagan in Bandel, about 70 km from Calcutta, around 11 pm that day. They were looking for my brother Mantu. When they didnt find him, they shook Raja out of sleep and took him away.

 Mantu, a grocer, has been absconding since the robbery in July. Ujjala looks after Raja, a Class V student of Lichubagan Primary School whose mother died four years ago. 

 The CPM unit in Hooghly slammed the police. We condemn their action. This is a glaring example of how police misuse power. The officers involved should be given exemplary punishment, said Anil Basu, the local party MP.

 The Legal Aid Forum, an NGO, said it would assist Ujjala lodge a complaint with the state human rights commission. We will take her to its office tomorrow, said a spokesperson.

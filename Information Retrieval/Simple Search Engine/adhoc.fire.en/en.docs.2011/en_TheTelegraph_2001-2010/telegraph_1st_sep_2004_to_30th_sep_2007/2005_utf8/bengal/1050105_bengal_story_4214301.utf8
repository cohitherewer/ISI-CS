 Tax talk for civic heads

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 4: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today urged municipalities to tighten their tax collection in order to become self-sufficient. 

 ?Do not fear that you will lose public support and fare badly in elections if you charge taxes. You have to collect taxes for the sake of providing good services to the people,? Bhattacharjee told the chairmen of 40 municipalities at a meeting this morning.

 The chief minister was meeting the municipal chiefs to review the DFID-sponsored Rs 700-crore Calcutta Urban Services for the Poor project, which is spread over 40 municipalities in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area.

 The project, which is to be completed by 2011, aims to focus on:

 Rehabilitating and building 

 assets for water supply, sanitation, drainage and small 

 access roads in slums 

 Rehabilitating and filling 

 gaps in the town network for basic water supply and sanitation 

 services 

 Partial meeting of costs 

 of water supply and sanitation projects serving two or more 

 municipalities 

 Bhattacharjee also told the meeting that money for the project should not go back unutilised. ?Keep me abreast of all developments in the project,? he said.

 ?The chief minister emphasised three things: first, the project money should be utilised only for those who are very poor. Second, stress should be laid on development of busti areas and third, we should ensure delivery of services to the poor,? urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said after the meeting.

 ?We are also trying to identify the areas where we need to start operations under the project,? he said.

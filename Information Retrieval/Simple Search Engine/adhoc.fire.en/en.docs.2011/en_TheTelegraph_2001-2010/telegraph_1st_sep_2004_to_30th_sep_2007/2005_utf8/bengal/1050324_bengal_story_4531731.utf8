 Safe water deadline set

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, March 23: The government today set for itself a 2007 deadline for supply of safe drinking water to all 79 arsenic-affected blocks spread in seven districts.

 ?We?ve already been able to supply arsenic-free water to 55 per cent of the affected people and hope to reach 75 per cent by next year. All steps are being taken to meet the target of providing safe drinking water to all affected areas by 2007,? public health engineering minister Gautam Deb said today.

 Over a million people in the two 24-Parganas, Nadia, Hooghly, Murshidabad, Malda and parts of Burdwan now drink arsenic in water. All 17 blocks of Nadia are affected.

 The minister said: ?We have implemented three major schemes at Joynagar in South 24-Parganas, Kaliachak in Malda and Barasat in North 24-Parganas. Three projects have been taken up in Nadia, Murshidabad and North 24-Parganas at an estimated Rs 1,200 crore.?

 The chief engineer of his department, K.L. Koley, said 16 million people are at risk of arsenic-related diseases. 

 ?Though we have sunk deep-aquifer tubewells and hand-pumped tubewells with arsenic treatment units, they are temporary measures. The permanent solution lies in the supply of filtered water from rivers,? said public health engineering secretary Asim Barman.

 The government, Deb said , intends to ensure that by 2007 but does not have enough money to do it on its own.

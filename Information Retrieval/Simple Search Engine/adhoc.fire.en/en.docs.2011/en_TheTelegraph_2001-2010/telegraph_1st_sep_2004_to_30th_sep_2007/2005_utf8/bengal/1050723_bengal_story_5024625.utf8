 BRIEFS

 Behrampore, July 22: A man beat his mother to death when she asked him for food this afternoon. 

 A tea-stall owner, Ganesh Das, 40, had returned home at Khagra, 200 km from Calcutta, around 2.30 pm for lunch when his 65-year-old mother Usha Rani told him that she was not given anything to eat by her daughter-in-law. Police said an enraged Ganesh started beating up his mother, who soon fell unconscious. She was declared dead at the sadar hospital here. Ganesh has been arrested.

 Calcutta: Trinamul Congress members threw away business papers and walked out of the Assembly on Friday as Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim refused to admit an adjournment motion. The Speaker later said that the Trinamul MLAs were not present on Thursday when the adjournment motion on alleged atrocities on a rebel CPM worker who had joined Trinamul in Moyna, East Midnapore, was supposed to have been read out by the partys Gobinda Naskar. Halims decision was biased, the MLAs alleged. SUCIs Probodh Purkait and Debaprasad Sarkar also walked out after demanding talks with the Maoists without any condition.

 Calcutta: Fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda said his department has prepared a master plan to protect the water bodies in Malda, North Dinajpur and Murshidabad and sent it to Union water resources development minister P.R. Das Munshi for funds. Another master plan is being drawn up for Nadia and North 24-Parganas.

 Burdwan: Madhab Mondal, the officer-in-charge of Katwa police station who courted controversy by playing moral police, was removed from his post on Friday. The officer went to girls schools asking students not to fall in love and pulled up couples taking a stroll together.

 New Delhi: British investigating agencies will give about Rs 50 lakh to those who helped arrest Maninder Pal Singh Kohli from Kalimpong, a year after he was held for the murder of a Southampton schoolgirl. Kohli had raped and killed 17-year-old Hannah Foster and fled the UK.

Bikers break law and batter cop

Helmetless amp; blind to red light, trio strikes 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, May 28: A 35-year-old constable was thrashed today when he tried to book three youths riding a motorcycle in violation of traffic rules. 

 None of the three was wearing helmets and they had also jumped a red light.

 Ratan Kumar Sarkar, of the South Traffic Guard, was taken to Calcutta Police Hospital with serious injuries on his scalp and arms. 

 Two of the youths ? Afiz Khan and Imtiaz Ahmed ? were arrested, while the third managed to escape. 

 The incident took place at the intersection of Jawaharlal Nehru Road and S.N. Banerjee Road, popularly known as Dorina crossing. 

 ?Officers in the Radio Flying Squad posted there saw the constable being beaten up and rushed to his help,? said Ajoy Kumar, deputy superintendent of police (central division).

 When the police reached the spot, ?a scuffle followed as passersby joined in and tried to prevent the officers from arresting the two. Things came to such a pass that the cops had to resort to lathicharge?, Kumar added. 

 This is the second incident of its kind this month. 

 A few weeks ago, traffic constable Subrata Chaudhury was hit by a speeding vehicle when he tried to stop it for a pollution check. Chaudhury died two days after the incident that took place near St George?s Gate Road under Hastings police station.

 This afternoon, Sarkar was on duty at Dorina crossing when he spotted the trio at 2.30. When the signal turned red, he raised his hand and tried to stop them as they were speeding away. 

 The youths screeched to a halt when they saw Sarkar taking down their bike?s number. They turned back and approached Sarkar who did not notice them. 

 Two of them stepped off the bike and told the constable to erase the entry. A war of words followed and when Sarkar refused to comply, they rained blows on him.

 When the Radio Flying Squad officers and policemen tried to rescue Sarkar, the three tried to attack them as well. 

 The scuffle continued for a while and a crowd gathered at the spot, adding to the melee. The police wielded the lathi to bring the mob under control. 

 Khan and Ahmed were arrested later in the evening by New Market police.

 Sarkar has been put under emergency observation. ?There are injury marks on his leg, arms and even on the scalp. Besides, there are swellings at different points on his body. He has been vomiting on and off and we are not taking chances. We will send him for a scan to examine internal injuries,? said S. Dutta, the doctor attending to Sarkar.

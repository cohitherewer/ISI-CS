 Minister clears air on land acquisition

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Sept. 10: The minister for urban development and municipal affairs, Asok Bhattacharya, today said the Siliguri Jalpaiguri Development Authority has acquired no agricultural land for urbanisation.

 No agricultural land has been acquired and whatever land that has been taken up for development, has been according to the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, Bhattacharya said at the annual public convention of the Siliguri Municipal Corporation.

 Some people are trying to spread rumours that we have acquired agricultural land, which is untrue. In fact, credit goes to our government for initiating land reforms and giving a better deal to the farmers and landless labourers, he said.

 Land acquisition was a must to build up the required infrastructure to meet the growing population pressure, said Bhattacharya.

 The population density of Siliguri is growing and because of a lack of planned development, the city is faced with a lot of problems. A lot of unplanned urban areas like Bagdogra and Atharakhoi have mushroomed in the outskirts, much at the cost of agricultural land, said the minister.

 Planned growth is necessary to avoid such kind of haphazard mushrooming of urban centres. Small haphazard towns are growing on their own, and when the government takes up steps to initiate a process for planned growth, there are criticisms that we are giving agriculture a raw deal, the urban development minister said.

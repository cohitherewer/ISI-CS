 Pollution glare on iron units

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 17: The state Pollution Control Board has set up a four-member panel to look into allegations of pollution against several sponge-iron factories in Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore. 

 Officials said the board had received complaints about noxious gases from factories polluting the atmosphere and water and damaging crops.

 The committee includes P.N. Roy, the chairman of the West Bengal Financial Development Corporation, Arunava Majumder, a professor at the All Indian Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, Jadavpur University professor Sabooj Bhawal and Biswajit Mukherjee, senior law officer of the board.

 The panel will assess the damage and submit its report to the board?s appellate authority by the second week of March. The authority will determine, on the basis of this report, the compensation to be paid to the farmers.

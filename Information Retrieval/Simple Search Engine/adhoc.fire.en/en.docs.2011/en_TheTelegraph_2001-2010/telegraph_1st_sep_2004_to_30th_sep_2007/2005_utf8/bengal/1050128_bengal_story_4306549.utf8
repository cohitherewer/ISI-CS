 Rap over Rs 2000 teachers

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Jan. 27: The high court today extended the injunction on appointment of qualified persons as temporary teachers to February 3 and slammed the government for the ?exploitation?. 

 ?The government has no authority to treat teachers having same educational qualifications in two different manners. The court cannot tolerate such exploitations,? Justice K.J. Sengupta said.

 The government has appointed several qualified persons as para-teachers (a temporary posting on contract) with paltry salary in state-aided schools across Bengal. 

 When the government pleader said the decision to appoint part-time teachers was spurred by a funds crunch, the judge erupted. 

 ?Please come to my chamber for half-an-hour. I will let your government know how to earn money. Thousands of black marketeers are evading taxes amounting to crores of rupees. Ask your government to collect the taxes properly,? an angry Sengupta said. 

 He added: ?Why don?t you make separate arrangements for these teachers? While a regular teacher is getting a salary of Rs 15,000 per month, a para-teacher is getting Rs 2,000 only. How can we permit that? Why don?t you ask the part-time teachers to teach in night schools??

 Earlier, he had said that the appointment of the para-teachers went against the law and ordered that schools can recruit teaching or non-teaching staff only under the School Service Commission rules or other relevant regulations. 

 The court is hearing together at least five cases alleging favouritism in the recruitment of para-teachers.

 Refund relief for car owners

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, Sept. 10: The transport department has decided to give refunds on road tax if any car owner intends to move to another state.

 Giving an instance of how the system would work, officials from the public vehicles department said if the tax on any car is paid up to 2010 and if the owner wants to shift it to another state in 2006, the owner will be refunded the tax he has paid for these four years.

 But, the officials said, vehicles coming from other metros would have to pay the entire road tax. 

 In Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore, owners of vehicles have to pay road tax for 15 years at one go. 

 But, in Bengal, the tax is paid for five years at one go for four-wheelers and there is a one-time tax for two-wheelers. For pre-1995 vehicles, there is still a system of paying road tax annually.

 As a result, officials said, car owners who bring their vehicles to Bengal have to incur a huge loss. But, car owners who leave the state, will get the advantage of the tax refund.

 The decision for the tax refund comes in the wake of appeals from hundreds of car owners who moved to other states. 

 On an average, about 250 to 300 cars leave the state every month. 

 We collect tax for plying vehicle but it is unfair to take tax for any vehicle which will not ply here. So, we have decided to refund the tax amount for the vehicles which will be shifted, said assistant director of PVD, Manab Chakraborty.

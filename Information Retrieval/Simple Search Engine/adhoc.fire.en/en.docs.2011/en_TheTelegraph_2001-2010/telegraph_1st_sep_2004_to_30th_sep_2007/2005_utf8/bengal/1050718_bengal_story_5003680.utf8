 Girls take man for a ride on bus

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, July 17: Two smartly dressed girls nearly made a fool of a mango trader travelling to Calcutta on a government bus yesterday.

 Alauddin Mollah was travelling to the city from Malda with Rs 2.10 lakh in a leather bag. When the bus reached Krishnagar ? about 85 km from Calcutta ? around 5 pm, two girls in their twenties ? one in a sari and the other in jeans ? boarded it.

 They identified themselves as Mousumi Dutta and Malati Goldar and struck up a conversation with Mollah, who was charmed into accepting biscuits they offered him. He dozed off and they emptied the bag. 

 A co-passenger, Abu Bakkar Mallik, was witness to the entire episode, but did not disclose it until the bus reached Beldanga in Murshidabad, where he lived. I observed the girls emptying Mollahs bag, but did not protest. On reaching Beldanga, I narrated it to local people, who gheraoed the bus and asked all three, including Mollah, to get down. Some women from the crowd searched the duo and handed them over to police after recovering the money, he recounted.

 Murshidabad police chief Neeraj Kumar Singh said Mousumi, who was married in Siliguri, and Malati were from Kashim Bazar in Murshidabad. We are probing if the duo has any record of crime. We are trying to locate the kingpin, he said.

 Senior district police officers, who said this was the first incident of drugging on a running bus, said guards were being deployed in long-distance buses.

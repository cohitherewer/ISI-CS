 Govt takes stock of police faux pas 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 10: Two days after a Calcutta Police gazette left the state government red in the face, home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy today said it was a deliberate act, hinting at a possible conspiracy aimed at maligning the force.

 Published on September 8, part IV of the gazette claimed that in the Sealdah court lock- up, one has to pay a bribe of Rs 200 to pass on snacks with foreign liquor to an inmate and Rs 100 to allow an inmate to speak on a cellphone. The gazette also claimed that anyone who had to meet an accused in the court lock-up could do so with a bribe of Rs 50. The same amount had to be paid to give tiffin outside the lock-up.

 Today, acting city police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarty handed Roy a report which held details of what went wrong and identified the loopholes that led to the faux pas. I have received the report and will hand it over to the chief minister on Monday. It appears that this was a deliberate act, Roy said at the Writers Buildings later. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had sought a report on the goof-up yesterday. 

 The gazette is a bulletin that gives details of police postings, promotions, transfers, penalties and also leave applications. Meant for internal circulation, it is issued by the deputy commissioner of the detective department. 

 The last one, carrying the details on the bribes, was signed by the detective department chief, Gyanwant Singh. 

 Todays report, while admitting the mistake on Singhs part, goes into the details of how the entire draft was possibly planted. It suggests that someone, well aware of how the police gazette is printed at Lalbazar, had planted the draft on the desk of the head assistant to the DC (DD-I). 

 The draft was left among a heap of papers on the table with a for the printer tag. As is the practice, the head assistant took all the stuff marked for the printer to the police press. The draft was forwarded to Singh who gave his assent without going through its contents.

 Although it has held Singh responsible for the slip, the report suggests that he was hard pressed for time owing to law and order duties. 

 The police top-brass, while asking Singh to fix responsibilities to prevent such slips, has showcaused the printer and the head assistant for the goof-up. 

 Both said it was a mistake. The composer said he keyed in all that was written, without giving a thought to its contents.

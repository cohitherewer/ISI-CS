 Wind-up cloud on transport corp

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 14: The West Bengal Surface Transport Corporation will have to wind up its bus operations and run only ferries if the government goes by the report of consultants studying ways of restructuring the five state transport corporations.

 The report submitted today by the Consultant Engineering Services and ICRA suggests that WBSTC?s 64 buses be merged with the Calcutta State Transport, which will then operate in the Calcutta Metropolitan Area ? Calcutta, North and South 24-Parganas, Howrah, Hooghly and Nadia.

 The Calcutta Tramways Company will remain an independent organisation and its operations will be unchanged. However, 500 CTC employees have been identified as idle and will be offered an early retirement scheme. The government will seek Rs 150 crore from UK?s department for international development for such a scheme for these employees, most of who are above 50.

 The North Bengal State Transport Corporation will look after Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar, North and South Dinajpur and Malda. The South Bengal State Transport Corporation will oversee operations in the southern districts.

 The consultants have asked the government to form a committee to frame a policy on coordinating the functions of the corporations after the merger. The panel will be headed by a senior transport department official. 

 The recommended fleet size will be 100 buses for every depot in the city and 60 buses for rural operations.

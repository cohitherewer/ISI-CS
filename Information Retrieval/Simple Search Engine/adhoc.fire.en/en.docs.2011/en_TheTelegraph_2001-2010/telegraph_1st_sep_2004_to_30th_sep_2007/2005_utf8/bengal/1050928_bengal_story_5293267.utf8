 Unhappy with girls, dads kill

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 27: Two fathers, in two districts, have killed their infant daughters over the past two days apparently because they did not want girls.

 Police today arrested Mantu Sahu from Churka in Sabang, West Midnapore, and Laltu Goswami from Pratappur in Howrah on charges of murdering their daughters. 

 Both have confessed to their crimes, the police said.

 Sahu took his two-month-old daughter to a pond behind his house, about 150 km from Calcutta, last Sunday, when his wife Annapurna was sleeping. He drowned the baby and later put her on the bed, beside her mother. She thought it was a natural death and the body was buried. Suspicious villagers called the police. 

 The body is yet to be traced. An officer said stray dogs might have taken it away. 

 At Pratappur, 60 km from Calcutta, Goswami strangled his 20-day-old daughter last night. His wife Mousumi lodged the complaint with the police.

 Colleges get 800 teachers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 13: The government today completed the exercise of creating more than 800 posts for teachers in state-aided undergraduate colleges and technology institutes.

 The posts are in addition to the approximately 12,000 that exist in about 340 undergraduate colleges and nine state-aided universities across Bengal.

 Higher education department officials said the move ? the first of its kind ? is aimed at enabling the colleges to better their standards of education. Recently, there has been an increasing demand for new courses, particularly in emerging areas like bio-technology, micro-biology, journalism, computer science and business administration. 

 Sources in the political circle, however, feel the decision has been taken with an eye on next year?s Assembly polls. 

 The finance department has given its nod to provide funds for paying salaries to the new teachers. Sources said an additional Rs 13 crore will have to be spent annually.

 ?The state-aided undergraduate colleges will get the largest numbers of new posts followed by the colleges run directly by the government like Presidency, Brabourne and Bethune... next come the state-controlled technology institutions,? said S. Sarkar, director of public instruction.

 Nearly 450 of the new posts ? all lecturers ? have been slotted for the state-aided colleges, while 242 posts ? also lecturers ? have been earmarked for undergraduate colleges run directly by the government. Approximately, 94 posts have been created for technology institutes and 16 new posts of principals for government-run colleges.

 The CPM-controlled West Bengal College and University Teachers? Association welcomed the move. 

 Officials said the government has laid down certain conditions for appointing the new teachers. Colleges will not get any of the new posts unless they are for courses for which they charge subsidised fees as fixed by the government.

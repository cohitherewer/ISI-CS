 Anil call for rebel territory clawback

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Jan. 11: Speaking at a party meet on Naxalite turf, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas today urged the cadre to launch a counter-attack. 

 ?The MCC (Maoist Communist Centre) and the People?s War have merged to form the CPI (Maoist). If they unleash terror, we cannot sit idle. We have to counter-attack with people by our side. We have to set up counter-resistance units,? Biswas () said while inaugurating the party conference of the West Midnapore unit at Chandrakona Road, 170 km from Calcutta.

 ?Some people are advising us to hold talks with the Naxalites. But I want to tell you very clearly that they (the rebels) are not a political force at all. Had they been able to consolidate their bases in Purulia, Bankura and the Midnapores, they would not have terrorised or killed villagers,? the CPM politburo member said. 

 Biswas emphasised on a stronger organisation to take on the Naxalites. ?We have to counter them in an organised manner if they go on killing our men and terrorising innocent villagers,? he said.

 He alleged that the Naxalites are hand-in-glove with the Jharkhand Party. ?With their help, the extremists want to create a zone of their own where there will be no policing.?

 Local CPM leaders and policemen have been the target of rebel attacks in the past few years in the districts Biswas mentioned. 

 He said: ?The CPM is the common enemy for both Naxalites and Jharkhand Party activists and that is why they have joined hands to eliminate our leaders.?

 Symbol jolt to Subrata

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, May 4: Mayor Subrata Mukherjee?s Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha will have to contest the forthcoming elections to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) without a symbol.

 ?Those entering the fray under the banner of the Mancha will not be offered a common symbol. Instead, they can contest as Independent candidates with different symbols,? Ajoy Sinha, the state election commissioner, told a news conference today. 

 ?Mukherjee?s newly floated platform is not a registered political party. So it cannot use a particular symbol for the candidates,? he added. 

 A section of leaders from the Mancha, however, have not given up hope and will call on Sinha tomorrow to persuade him to let them use a ?common symbol?.

 Mukherjee left for Delhi today to invite senior leaders from the Congress, Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party for Sunday?s mass convention, to be held at the Calcutta University Institute Hall. 

 The mayor was accompanied by former state Congress president Somen Mitra, with whom he discussed a possible electoral alliance for the civic polls slated for June 19.

 ?Subrata?s plan is to rope in NCP chief Sharad Pawar and SP leader Amar Singh for the proposed convention, besides defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and Priya Ranjan Das Munshi,? said a Mancha spokesperson.

 When he returns tonight, Mukherjee is expected to discuss seat adjustments with leaders from small non-Left secular parties.

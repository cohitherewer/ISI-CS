 Tonga ride on elders day out

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 1: A group of schoolchildren and 65 inmates of old-age homes had a whale of a time when they got together at St. Pauls Cathedral to celebrate World Elders Day today.

 Our theme is a society for all ages and this day is a rare opportunity for old people to have fun and for children to interact with them and realise that they need to be taken care of, said Sushmita Ghosh, the regional director of HelpAge India, the non-government organisation which organised the event.

 The highlight of the programme was a late afternoon tonga ride down Maidan and Victoria Memorial. We try to make it different each year. Last year, we took them for a ferry ride and next year, I hope to arrange a plane ride for them, Ghosh said.

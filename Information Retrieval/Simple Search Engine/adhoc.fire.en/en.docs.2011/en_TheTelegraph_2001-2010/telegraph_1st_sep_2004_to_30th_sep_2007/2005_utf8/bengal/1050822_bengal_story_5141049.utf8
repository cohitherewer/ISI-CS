 Minister in Asansol poll fray

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 21: The CPM leadership today nominated small-scale industry minister Bansagopal Chowdhury as its candidate for the Asansol Lok Sabha bypoll on September 28.

 The Burdwan district leadership had referred the name of Chowdhury ? the MLA from Ranigunge ? to the state leadership for the Lok Sabha bypoll, necessitated by the death of Bikash Chowdhury of the CPM. The state committee, at its meeting today, took the decision to nominate him.

 This is the second recent occasion of the CPM has nominated a cabinet minister for the Lok Sabha polls. The party had fielded Mohammad Salim, the then minister for minorities welfare, for the May Lok Sabha elections. 

 CPM state secretary Anil Biswas today hinted that nobody would replace Chowdhury if he is elected to the Lok Sabha. Instead, the portfolio may be looked after by one of the CPM ministers in Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees cabinet.

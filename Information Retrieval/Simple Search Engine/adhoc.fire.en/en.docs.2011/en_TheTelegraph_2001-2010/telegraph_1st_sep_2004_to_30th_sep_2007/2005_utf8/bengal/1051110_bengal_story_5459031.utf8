 Adhir fissure in Congress

 OUR BUREAU

 Behrampore/Calcutta, Nov. 9: The cracks in the state Congress came to the fore with several party MLAs staying away from todays demonstration in Behrampore town, organised to protest the arrest warrants against MP Adhir Chowdhury and his wife Arpita. 

 Congress legislators Atish Sinha, Mayarani Pal and Niamat Sheikh were among those who skipped the day-long sit-in.

 Senior Congress leader Priya Ranjan Das Munshi said those who gave the protest a miss were not doing justice to the organisation.

 Today, CPM leaders have slapped false cases on Adhir, Das Munshi said and warned party members that soon the Left would gun for them. This is a calculated attempt to smear the entire organisation.

 Adhir and his wife have been accused of involvement in the murders of a father and son in July.

 In a veiled criticism of party leaders, including former state Congress chief Somen Mitra, for their alleged hobnobbing with the CPM, Das Munshi said: I am unlike others who strike deals with the CPM under the cover of darkness. 

 He regretted that some Congress leaders had publicly spoken against him for talking to CPM state secretary Anil Biswas about the arrest of Adhirs wife. Whats wrong if I requested Anil to ensure that our MPs wife, who is undergoing treatment, must not be harassed by police? he asked. 

 Charge against Anil

 Chowdhury today alleged that Biswas and three other CPM leaders have accounts in foreign banks. In an interview to STAR Ananda, the Congress MP said: If the CPM leaders have guts, let them reveal what they have in foreign banks. 

 Countering the charge, Biswas said: I am giving Chowdhury a 48-hour deadline to substantiate the allegation against me. Once he fails to do so, he will have to tender an unconditional apology. I have decided to file a criminal case against him for making such a baseless allegation against me. I shall also file a defamation suit against him.

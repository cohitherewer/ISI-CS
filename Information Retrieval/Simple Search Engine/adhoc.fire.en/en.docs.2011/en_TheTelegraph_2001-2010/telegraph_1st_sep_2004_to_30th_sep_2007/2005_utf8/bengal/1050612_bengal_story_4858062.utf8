 Mamata counts on Cong rebels

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mamata

 Calcutta, June 11: A day after Congress leaders hinted at a post-poll adjustment with the Trinamul Congress in the event the June 19 election throws up a hung civic board, Mamata Banerjees party today said this could be worked out only if the Congress councillors crossed over.

 We shall not back a Congress-led alliance to form the board. Instead, we will expect the Congress councillors who are really opposed to the CPM to help us form the board as they did in 2000, Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy said this afternoon.

 Trinamul sources said Mamata has told her associates she would welcome support from the real anti-CPM Congress councillors if the party fails to gain absolute majority. I believe that a section of Congress councillors will definitely help us retain the civic body in Calcutta, she is learnt to have told key Trinamul functionaries. Mamata was, however, not available for comment.

 The sources said former chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Rays appeal to both Mamata and a section of Congress leaders to unite to keep the CPM at bay has made the Trinamul chief think again about the post-poll scenario.

 Mukul Roy, overseeing the partys electioneering, recalled that nine Congress councillors had switched over to the Trinamul in 2000 and helped it wrest the civic board from the ruling CPM. 

 We are not going to help the Congress form the board. Instead, those opposed to the CPM will, on their own, help us retain the board if we fall short of majority, he said.

 State Trinamul president Subrata Bakshi said Congress workers, who have been subjected to torture and humiliation all these years at the hands of communists, would not accept the party hobnobbing with the CPM at the Centre. 

 In fact, these Congress workers will have to back Mamata after realising that they will not be able to fight the CPM tooth and nail by remaining within the party. They still consider us the only anti-CPM force in Bengal, he added.

 Poll security

 The state election commission today asked the district magistrates of North and South 24-Parganas as well as Hooghly to intensify vigil to prevent the entry of outsiders into the city on polling day. 

 Outsiders will not be allowed to move around the polling premises without valid reason, said state election commissioner Ajoy Sinha.

 A Congress delegation, led by Union water resources development minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, called on Sinha this morning to complain that the CPM planned to bring in hundreds of youths from various parts of South and North 24-Parganas for booth-jamming and rigging.

 Sinha said he has asked the city police to make preventive arrests of criminals to ensure free and fair elections. Police have so far picked up nearly 3,000 anti-socials in a pre-poll drive. More arrests are likely in a day or two.

 The ban on entry of photographers and video cameramen inside the booths would remain in force, Sinha added. 

 The state election commission has also asked the West Bengal State Electricity Board and the CESC to maintain uninterrupted power supply on the polling day.

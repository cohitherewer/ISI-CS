 Land bar set for repeal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 8: Pressured by demands for planned urban development in reforms-bound Bengal, the government is planning to scrap the land ceiling act that governs use of prime land in Calcutta, Barrackpore, Barasat, Asansol, Durgapur and Kalyani.

 ?We?re thinking of doing away with the concept of a ceiling on land holdings for the sake of faster development. However, we also want a certain control to stay in place so that the land does not go to the mafia,? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said this evening.

 The chief minister was speaking after a meeting with some cabinet colleagues to form an opinion on the issue, which is sensitive as various quarters are opposed to the move.

 The genesis of the West Bengal Urban Land Ceiling Act lies in the 1970s, when a handful of individuals owned vast tracts of land in and around Calcutta. 

 An urban development official said: ?The situation is exactly the reverse now. The government wants private operators to take up infrastructure development, especially housing. We would like to set free the land now locked in old industrial units or lying vacant. However, the government has been discussing this for many years and still not been able to make up its mind.?

 Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen, law minister Nisith Adhikary, health and panchayat minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya and advocate-general Balai Roy attended today?s meeting. 

 ?We have to bring in a framework,? Bhattacharjee said. ?Our advocate-general is looking into the legalities.? 

 Officials said the government would soon undertake a survey to determine the quantum of land locked in closed industries and other disputes. The exercise would enable it to draw up an estimate of the area that would be freed if the act is done away with. 

 An official said Bengal has failed to create townships like Gurgaon and New Mumbai because of problems in land acquisition.

 Cheating plea 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Basirhat, March 1: Unruly scenes more readily associated with the examination system marred by rampant cheating in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were enacted at a Madhyamik centre where 16 external candidates were taking the history test today. 

 The girls urged invigilators at Purnachandra Majumder Girls? High School in North 24-Parganas, 80 km from Calcutta, to allow them to copy from books and other materials supplied to them by outsiders as soon as the test began. Some of them had already started copying. 

 The invigilators protested and snatched away the answer scripts of all 16. Violence seemed imminent when the people slipping in chits through windows tried to enter the hall. But the police at the centre pushed them back. 

 All the examinees, barring one, later submitted blank answer scripts. 

 Dibyendu Hota, the president of the board of secondary education, described it as a stray incident, but said: ?We are taking it very seriously and will conduct an inquiry.?

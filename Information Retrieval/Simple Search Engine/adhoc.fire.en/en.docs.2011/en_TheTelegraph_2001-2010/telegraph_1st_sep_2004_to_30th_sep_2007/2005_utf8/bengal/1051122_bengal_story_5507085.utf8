 Child rape cuffs on DYFI leader

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 21: A Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) leader was arrested today for allegedly raping a six-year-old girl last week.

 The Class I student of a school near Kakdwip in South 24-Parganas, 70 km from Calcutta, was admitted to Diamond Harbour Subdivisional Hospital for a medical test on November 16, a day after she was allegedly attacked. 

 The report is, however, still not available.

 Police said a case was registered against Mangal Dandapat, a leader of the CPM youth wing, on November 18. The girls father, a small farmer, had lodged a written complaint against him. 

 We started looking for him immediately after the complaint was lodged, but were able to pick him up only this morning as he was absconding, said S.N. Gupta, the district superintendent of police. The girls statement has been recorded, Gupta added.

 Preliminary investigations have revealed that Dandapat accosted her when she was returning home after taking tuition from a private tutor. Being familiar with Dandapat, a neighbour, the girl agreed to go to his house with him.

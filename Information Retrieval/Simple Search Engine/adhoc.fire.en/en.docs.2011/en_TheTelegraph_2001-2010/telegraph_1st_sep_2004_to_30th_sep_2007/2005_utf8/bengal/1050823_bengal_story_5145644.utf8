 JEE goes for format shift

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 22: No more 

 essay-type questions in joint entrance examinations (JEE). 

 Students appearing in the state JEE from 2006 onwards will 

 be asked to answer only objective-type questions.

 Our move is aimed at restructuring the state JEE along the pattern followed in most national level entrance tests. The new system will be put into effect from next year, N.R.Banerjea, board chairman and vice-chancellor, Bengal University of Engineering and Science said.

 The state board conducting the JEE for admission of students in the states engineering and medical colleges finalised its decision on Monday to change the JEE to an objective-type test.

 Since students will need to study the 10+2 course more thoroughly under the multiple-choice format, the board today also announced its decision to slash 30 per cent of the total JEE syllabus both in engineering and medical.

 For the first time since the introduction of the JEE in the state, the test will be based on objective-type questions. Under the existing system students have to answer subjective-type questions.

 The board, however, set up two committees today. One of them will give suggestions on revising the JE syllabus, which will to be put into effect from 2007. The other committee will examine whether the JE syllabus should include only the class XII syllabus of the higher secondary course or it should consist of topics taken from both classes XI and XII, sources in the board said.

 Todays decision to introduce the multiple-choice system was taken on the basis of the recommendations of a panel that was recently set up by the board to examine the proposal on scrapping the existing subjective-type pattern. 

 The objective-type system has been introduced in most other all-India competitive examinations, like the IIT entrance exams, the All India Engineering Entrance Examinations and the national level medical entrance tests. Under the new system, answer scripts will be examined using the computerised optical marks recorder system.

 Flesh trade glare on CPM leader

 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN

 Behrampore, Dec. 25: An unwed mother has lodged 

 a police complaint in Murshidabad against a local CPM leader, 

 his wife and his brother on the charge of selling her off 

 in Bangladesh for flesh trade.

 Twenty-four-year-old Pinjura Khatun 

 of Bidupur, about 250 km from Calcutta, has named CPM local 

 committee member Bisaraddin Biswas, his wife Tuhina and 

 his brother Naushad in her complaint but Jalangi police 

 are yet to arrest them.

 Pinjura, now lodged in a home 

 for destitute women run by an NGO in Beldanga, approached 

 Murshidabad superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh on 

 December 20. Following instructions from the SP, an officer 

 from Jalangi police station, Utpal Das, went to the home 

 and recorded Pinjuras statement.

 The charges are very serious. 

 I have instructed Jalangi police to arrest Bisaraddin and 

 his wife immediately. Naushad is absconding. We are looking 

 for him, Singh said.

 Pinjura, the daughter of a farmer, 

 Alam Mondal, said she was a BA second-year student at Karimpur 

 College in Nadia when she got a job to teach Bisaraddins 

 Class IV daughter last year.

 I fell in love with Naushad 

 in August 2004 and became pregnant last December. But Naushad 

 refused to marry me. I held my ground and decided against 

 an abortion, said Pinjura.

 She lodged a complaint with Jalangi 

 police but they did not take any action.

 In May, Bisaraddin and his wife 

 Tuhina told her that Naushad had agreed to marry her. They 

 also convinced her to cross over to Bangladesh where Naushad 

 was staying.

 On May 15, Tuhina and I 

 crossed over to Rajshahi in Bangladesh illegally with the 

 help of touts. There I met Naushad after a long time.

 For 10 days, we were in 

 a rented house from where Naushad took me to Dhaka for medical 

 treatment. We put up at a hotel in Dhaka. I also saw Bisaraddin 

 there. Naushad and Bisaraddin sold me to a middleman for 

 Taka 25,000, said Pinjura.

 Pinjura said the middleman took 

 her to a doctor for abortion. When I was going to 

 be anaesthetised, I broke down in front of the doctor and 

 told him everything. He contacted police and handed me over 

 to them. The middleman fled, she added.

 As Pinjura had entered Bangladesh 

 illegally, she was sent to jail. She gave birth to a daughter 

 on August 23 there. 

 She was sent back to India on 

 December 7 and was lodged in the home run by an NGO after 

 her parents refused to accept, fearing social ostracism.

 Singh has asked Jalangi police 

 to club Pinjuras previous complaint with the case 

 of being sold off and draw up a comprehensive charge sheet.

 Bisaraddin, however, denied the 

 charges levelled against him and Naushad. The charges 

 brought against us are false. It is true we have visited 

 Bangladesh, as we have relatives there. But I havent 

 been there in eight years. So there is no question of my 

 selling Pinjura to a pimp, he said.

 However, Afazaddin Biswas, a villager 

 of Bidupur, said Bisaraddin was caught in Bangladesh for 

 travelling illegally and was sent back in November. The 

 district CPM has also initiated an inquiry against Bisaraddin.

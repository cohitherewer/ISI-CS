 Burdwan, Oct. 5: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government today called for a better interface between industry and the academy for employment generation and improved industrial production.

 We have understood ? though late ? that there is an urgent need for cohesion between education and industry. Those in our state are busy researching in laboratories and other places are spending a lifetime for a doctorate degree, fame or simply a job, said Nirupam Sen.

 But, if their knowledge could be utilised in industry, it would have helped increase production, generate more employment and create better competition, the commerce and industry minister said while inaugurating a seminar on Technology and Business: Quest for Excellence.

 The seminar was held as part of Kaizen 2005, a three-day IT and career fair organised by Burdwan Universitys department of commerce and presented by The Telegraph.

 Sen pointed out that those studying commerce dont realise that they can be of immense help in developing industries. The students of the commerce stream should shun their attitude of craving cushy jobs. Instead, they should come to set up industries and generate employment, he said.

 The vice-chancellor of Burdwan University, Amit Mullick, said the focus of the fair is to make students from higher secondary to post-graduate levels aware of the current trends of the job market, the service provided by placement and consulting firms and awareness of different courses offered by universities.

 The managing director of ABP and the president of Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Aniruddha Lahiri, underlined the need for industry-oriented syllabus for commerce students. 

 Lahiri said globalisation had many positive sides. Through globalisation it is possible to understand the international yardstick of a product. The developed countries are getting the benefit if globalisation, he said.

 Third world countries like us should also grab the benefits of globalisation. This will lead to improvement in the market and products, said Lahiri.

 Mamata ?alone? foxes leaders

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Jan. 23: Mamata Banerjee?s announcement yesterday that Trinamul Congress would ?go-it-alone? in the civic polls in the city and elsewhere has left leaders and party workers confused.

 About a fortnight after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh invited her to join his government, the Trinamul leaders and followers had expected that she would clarify her stand on the Congress and the BJP.

 But, at a rally in Tamluk town this afternoon on the concluding day of the party?s all-India conference, she did not spell out anything above speculation. Mamata said the conference was not to be an election rally and refused to clarify if she meant equal distance from the Congress and the BJP when she said ?alone?. 

 Tamluk MLA Nirbed Roy said: ?We expected her to make some policy announcement at the conference. If not, what are such meets for?? 

 Several other leaders felt let down by Mamata?s refusal to clear her stand. She should have at least said if Trinamul would enter into an informal pact with the Congress to consolidate anti-Left votes, said one of them. ?In the Lok Sabha polls last May, we paid the price for our alliance with the BJP. There was a sharp drop in Muslim votes. In the elections to Calcutta Municipal Corporation and the three municipalities in Nadia and elsewhere there would be a sizeable number of Muslim voters. We need to know in clear terms where we stand.? 

 Skirting the BJP-Congress dilemma, Mamata, however, focused on CPM bashing.

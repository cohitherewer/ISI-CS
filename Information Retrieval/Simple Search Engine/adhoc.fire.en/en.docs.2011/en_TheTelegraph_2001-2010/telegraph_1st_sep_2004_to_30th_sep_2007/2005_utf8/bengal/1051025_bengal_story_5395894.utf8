 CPM?s crime list draws Bihar parallel

 - Party calls in absconders

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 24: Some 800 CPM functionaries, including a minister, are on the run as they are wanted in connection with acts of crime, the party leadership said today.

 The Opposition has often alleged that the CPM, an advocate of morality in politics, harbours criminals. 

 ?We have advised minister Narayan Biswas and all others to try and obtain bail after surrendering themselves to the judicial system. They will have to have their names cleared,? said Anil Biswas, the state CPM secretary.

 The statement would suggest that neither the party nor the government would protect wanted party members.

 By Biswas?s own admission, some 8,000 party functionaries have criminal cases against them. About 90 per cent have either got bail or are facing legal action. The rest are on the run.

 Seconds after Biswas?s admission, the Opposition Trinamul Congress, Congress and the BJP began to ask questions. How could such a large number of party functionaries avoid the law unless they were being protected by the government or the party? Why are the police not arresting the wanted CPM minister? 

 The police have not arrested even the Congress MP, Adhir Chowdhury, against whom there is a warrant.

 ?When it comes to speaking with a forked tongue, no- body can better the performance of the Marxists,? said Mamata Banerjee.

 ?They will lecture the rest of the country about political morality and cite how politics has been criminalised in Bihar. The same Marxists misuse state resources to offer protection to ministers and party functionaries whom the court has defined as criminals. Bengal is worse than Bihar,? the Trinamul chief said. 

 Former mayor Subrata Mukherjee, who has left Trinamul, said: ?Senior CPM leaders are involved in criminal activities in districts, but the police, under instruction from the party and the government, would not move.?

 Anil Biswas contested the Opposition?s clubbing of Bengal and Bihar. ?Our commitment to the judicial system is evident from the way one of our senior leaders today surrendered in court,? he said. 

 In the morning, Manabesh Chowdhury, a CPM state committee member and the secretary of the party?s South Dinajpur unit, surrendered in connection with cases of arson and looting. The Balurghat chief judicial magistrate?s court remanded him in judicial cus-tody till December 5 after rejecting his bail plea. 

 Biswas, however, said: ?We feel the cases against him have been fabricated.?

 Another leader and minister, Narayan Biswas, has done no such thing. 

 a senior officer admitted that the police were aware of his whereabouts. ?We cannot move against Biswas or any other top CPM functionary till it is greenlighted by the government and the party brass,? he said.

 As for Adhir Chowdhury, Murshidabad police chief Niraj Kumar Singh said they had been ?unable to lay our hands on? the Behrampore MP. 

 There is a warrant against his wife also in the same case ? in the murders of a father and son in Behrampore ? but she, too, is walking free.

 Sitting in Delhi, Chowdhury told The Telegraph: ?Vendetta is the buzzword in Buddhadeb?s Bengal.?

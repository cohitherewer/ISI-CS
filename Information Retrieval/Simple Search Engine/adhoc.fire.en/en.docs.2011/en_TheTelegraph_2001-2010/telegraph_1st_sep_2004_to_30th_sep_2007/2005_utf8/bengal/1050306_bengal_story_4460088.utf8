 Paper leak scare

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, March 5: Three youths were detained last night for selling suggestions for the Madhyamik life science question paper, the examination for which was held yesterday. 

 ?We detained the youths after some of the suggestions prepared by them matched some of the questions that appeared in the life science paper. But we had to release them after we were convinced that they were merely suggestions and not a question paper leak,? superintendent of police, N.K. Singh said tonight. 

 The police said the youths had engaged some agents who were approaching examinees in different centres in Burdwan town and adjoining areas to sell sample question papers on all subjects. 

 The group had already earned several thousands of rupees by selling these sample papers to students.

 Yesterday, they sold some papers on the life science examination. 

 Those who bought them just an hour before the examination were astonished to find that many of the questions appeared in the question paper. 

 The agents also gave a mobile phone number and asked the examinees to contact them for suggestion papers on the remaining subjects. 

 Acting on information from residents here, the police laid a trap and picked up Prasanta Sarkar from his residence at Lichubagan, under Kalna police station. 

 The police also interrogated two of his associates ? Tapas Barui and Bapan Roy. Some sample question papers were also seized from the three.

 Sources said the youths charged Rs 1,000 for each paper. 

 The district magistrate of Burdwan, Subrata Gupta, said that the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education in Calcutta has been informed of the incident.

 Arun Bhattacharya, the regional director of the board in Burdwan, also admitted having received a complaint from police. 

 But he refused to elaborate on the matter. 

 Board president Dibyendu Hota, when contacted in Calcutta, denied any knowledge about the incident. 

 ?Some people always try to make an issue out of the leaking of question papers during Madhyamik examinations,? Hota said.

 ?This time it also appears that such an attempt was made. But let me make it clear that it is all rubbish and I have not received any complaint to this effect,? the board chief said tonight.

 BRIEFS

 Nabadwip, Sept. 11: PWD minister and senior RSP leader Amar Chowdhury has earned the wrath of his party by attending a seminar at the Iskcon (International Society for Krishna Consciousness) temple at Mayapur today. 

 Chowdhury, who spoke on the life and philosophy of Iskcon founder Prabhupada, called it a personal visit. Nadia RSP secretary Shankar Chakraborty, however, said: It might be personal, but the party does not approve of a member attending a religious function. 

 Durgapur: A sub-in- spector was killed when the police vehicle he was travelling in rammed into a truck on National Highway 2 early on Sunday morning. Sashtipada Mondal, 55, who was posted at Kanksa police station, about 200 km from Calcutta, was on his way to an outpost on Burdwan-Braham road to join night duty when the driver of his vehicle lost control and hit the truck. The driver has been hospitalised.

 Haldia: Union surface transport and shipping minister T.R. Baalu said here on Sunday the Centre would pitch in for the citys infrastructure development. An MoU was signed between the Haldia Development Authority and the National Highway Authority of India for building a road that will connect the in-dustry hub with NH 41.

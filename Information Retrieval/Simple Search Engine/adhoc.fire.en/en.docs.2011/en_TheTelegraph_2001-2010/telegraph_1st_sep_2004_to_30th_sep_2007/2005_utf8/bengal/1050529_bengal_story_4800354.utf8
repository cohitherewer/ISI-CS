 MP waylaid, car snatched

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Purulia, May 28: An armed gang of six waylaid the car of Purulia MP Birsingh Mahato on the Purulia-Bagmundi road last night and assaulted his driver before snatching the vehicles keys from him.

 They took away the service revolver from the Forward Bloc MPs security guard, Dasharath Mahato, and robbed Rs 5,000, two mobile phones and other valuables from Birsingh before escaping in his car.

 Police said the incident took place at Duarsini village near Ayodhya hills, about 330 km from Calcutta, around 9.30 last night.

 The MP, who was stranded in the area till the early hours today when a passing car rescued him, lodged a complaint with the Bagmundi and Jhalda police stations and took up the matter with the Blocs Calcutta office.

 Birsingh was returning to his village, Suisa, from Jhalda town where he had gone to attend a party programme when the incident took place.

 The criminals intercepted his Ambassador by placing boulders on the road and robbed him at gunpoint.

 During the day, the gang had looted passengers of three other cars and snatched two motorcycles.

 Two persons have been arrested in this connection. The MPs security guard was suspended on charges of dereliction of duty.

 Had the security guard opened fire to scare away the miscreants, the incident would not have happened, said district superintendent of police, R. Shivkumar.

 Anil Kumar, inspector-general of police, western range, who rushed to the area this morning to probe the matter, said raids are being conducted to nab the criminals.

 The MP said he was surprised to know that travellers were regularly attacked by armed criminals on the road between Jhalda and Bagmundi. 

 He demanded permanent police posting in the area in view of the spurt in incidents of dacoity.

 State Forward Bloc secretary Ashok Ghosh in Calcutta said he was worried over last nights incident and demanded that police vigil be intensified on the Jhalda-Purulia road.

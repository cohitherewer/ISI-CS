 Study to pinpoint Bangla border

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, Aug. 28: A fresh survey of the border with Bangladesh in the Old Malda police station area will soon be conducted to determine the exact position of the zero-point, blurred by erosion of the rivers flowing along the frontier.

 Malda district magistrate Abhijit Chowdhury today said that Muchia and Adampur, the two problem areas where the Border Security Force (BSF) and Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) had exchanged heavy fire on August 19, would be particularly under the scanner.

 The spot at Gilabari, where the Bangladesh irrigation department was carrying out the disputed anti-erosion work, actually falls within Indian territory. The Bangladeshis have claimed as their own Indian territory in many places, Chowdhury said.

 Following a request from the home department, the joint secretary of the Indo-Bangladesh Border Authority, Sujit Chakrabarty, visited the area yesterday.

 According to the home ministry officer, the last time the survey of the international border was conducted in 2002. Chakrabarty told the district magistrate that the international border in the Muchia-Adampur area was fixed in consultation with the Bangladeshi delegates to be the middle of the Mahananda. This line got blurred as the river changed course and eroded away the land, Chowdhury said.

 The district magistrate said an Indo-Bangladesh Border Authority team was scheduled to visit Malda on September 2. The team members will have detailed discussions with senior BSF officers. The border force has been asked to bring its maps, Chowdhury said.

 The meeting will decide when the actual survey will take place. We will finalise the date and then inform the Bangladesh government. I have also spoken to the district magistrate of Chapainbarganj across the border. After preliminary studies of the mouza maps with us it appears that quite a large chunk of land that belonged to us is now occupied by Bangladesh, Chowdhury said.

 In Raiganj, Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi has instructed the BSFs north Bengal inspector-general to submit a detailed report on the erosion that has affected the border demarcation. He is scheduled to meet officials in Dhaka on September 19 and 20.

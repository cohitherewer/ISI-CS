 Suicide blame on live-in mate

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 12: A 28-year-old woman committed suicide early today leaving behind a note that put the blame for her untimely death on the son of the chief marshal of the Bihar Assembly, Bhanu Pratap Sinha.

 The police said Anuradha Mangatri, a private bank employee, hanged herself. The note she left behind says Sinha?s son Suraj, 25, with whom she had been living for the past three years, drove her to death by having an affair with another girl. 

 Anuradha was found dead at her South Road apartment in the East Jadavpur police station area. ?Even though we are living together for the past three years, he has an affair with another girl. Now, I have no option left except committing suicide,? reads the suicide note. 

 Suraj works in a software firm. He was the first to notice the body hanging from the ceiling. Additional superintendent of police H.K. Kusumakar said: ?He was on night-shift and returned home around 6.30 am from his office in Salt Lake?s Sector V. He opened the door with a duplicate key and entered the bedroom to see his girlfriend dead. She hanged herself from the fan with a dupatta.?

 He brought down the body without informing anyone, not even the next-door neighbour or his landlord. 

 The officer said: ?He informed us around 10.30 am. We will check why Suraj took so long to inform us. He told us that he broke down on seeing his girlfriend dead and took some time to collect his nerves.?

 Anuradha, the police said, came to the city from Kalimpong five years ago and joined the bank. The police said they ?rented the apartment last August and started living together?.

 The police have not received any complaint of wrongdoing so far. The woman?s family in Kalimpong has been informed. ?If they lodge a complaint, we will investigate,? Kusumakar said, adding: ?We?ll check if the contents of the suicide note are true. The post-mortem report will reach us in a day or two.?

 Anuradha, who had gone to Bangalore for office work, returned last Monday. ?Neighbours have confirmed that of late they heard Suraj and Anuradha quarrelling frequently,? said an officer.

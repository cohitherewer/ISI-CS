 Sealdah stop in ?killer? tutor trip

 A STAFF REPORTER 

Calcutta, April 16: Somnath Dawn, who allegedly 

pushed his daughter off a hilltop in Rajgir, told police today that he was in 

the city for three days before leaving for Mayapur with his 19-year-old student.

 Dawn had stayed outside the waiting room on the first floor of Sealdah station with his 13-year-old son Soumyajit and student Pinky Dey. 

 At the station, the 52-year-old teacher chalked out the plan for slipping out of the city to Mayapur with Pinky. 

 The police said before leaving for Mayapur, Somnath dropped his son at Central Avenue, returned to Sealdah station and boarded a local train with Pinky. 

 At Mayapur, the two took a launch across a river and went straight to the Iskcon headquarters, where Somnath introduced Pinky as his daughter.

 ?After gaining the confidence of a section of the Iskcon top brass, Pinky was employed in the mutt?s incense stick factory while Somnath was engaged to wash utensils of senior sadhus. After a few days, the two were allotted a room inside the campus,? said a senior officer of the Jorabagan police station. 

 Somnath has been booked on charges of murdering his daughter. 

 Parts of Somashree?s decomposed body along with remnants of her clothes were sent to the state forensic laboratory today for tests. 

 Officers claimed the body parts would also be sent to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory for a DNA test and an examination involving her bones and anatomical features as available from her photograph. 

 ?This is an advanced test that will throw up several aspects of the victim?s body, and the results will be vital for our investigation,? said Barun Mullick, the deputy commissioner of police, north.

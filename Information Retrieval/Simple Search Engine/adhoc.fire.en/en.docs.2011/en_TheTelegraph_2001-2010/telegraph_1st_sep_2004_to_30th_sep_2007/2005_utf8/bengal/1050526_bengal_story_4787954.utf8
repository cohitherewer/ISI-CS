 Alliance call echoes 

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, May 25: Wiser 

 from their performance, Trinamul and Congress leaders tonight 

 agreed that a division in anti-Left votes had cost them 

 dear. 

 The results should be an eye-opener for us. If the Opposition had united, the Left Front would have lost 15 municipalities, state Congress general secretary Manas Bhuniya said.

 Showcasing Englishbazar in Malda, where the grand alliance of the Congress and the Trinamul Congress-BJP retained the board, he said: We should have followed the same formula in other municipalities also.

 The mahajot has the prospect of forming boards in some of the municipalities where no party has got a clear mandate. They include Tamluk and Ramjivanpur in Midnapore, Baduria and Bongaon in North 24-Parganas and Suri and Bolpur in Birbhum.

 Though state CPM secretary Anil Biswas ruled out a post-poll alliance to take charge of the hung municipalities, both Congress and Trinamul leaders began talks to keep the front at bay.

 We have nothing to say if the boards are formed through local adjustments, Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy said, careful not to refer to mayor Subrata Mukherjees call for an alliance with the Congress, which earned him Mamatas rod. 

 Toeing Mukherjees line, a section of Trinamul leaders today demanded an alliance with anti-Left forces to oust the ruling communists from Bengal. Mukherjee floated the Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha to bring all anti-CPM secular forces under an umbrella after having annoyed Mamata.

 Todays results have proved that the emergence of a formidable anti-CPM force could be the only alternative to the ruling CPM, he said. 

 Trinamul sources said some key leaders were closeted with Mamata tonight to discuss the course of action in the wake of another debacle after last years general elections. We are bound to lose again if we are not able to bring the anti-CPM votes in our favour, one of them is learnt to have told Mamata.

 The elections to Calcutta Municipal Corporation and Bidhannagar and Uttarpara-Kotrang municipalities are due on June 19. 

 To prevent the split in votes is the need of the hour but how is it possible to tie up with the Congress if it continues to hobnob with the CPM? asked Saugata Roy, the Trinamul MLA from Dhakuria.

 Congress leaders also began a soul search to stem the vote split in its own ranks.

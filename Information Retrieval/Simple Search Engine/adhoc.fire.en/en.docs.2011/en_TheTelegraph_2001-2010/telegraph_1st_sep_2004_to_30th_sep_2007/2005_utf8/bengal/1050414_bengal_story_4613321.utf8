 Cousin strangles child for property

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, April 13: Sights set on his uncle?s property, a teenager strangled his six-year-old cousin to death.

 Suprabhat Ghosh?s decomposed body, packed into a gunny bag, was fished out of a pond this morning at Shantipur in Nadia district, 70 km from Calcutta.

 Police have arrested 19-year-old Haru Ghosh, a school dropout. A hunt is on for a few others, suspected to be Haru?s accomplices.

 Before Suprabhat was born, his father Shyamal, one of the richest farmers in Shantipur, had promised to bequeath part of his property, worth Rs 50 lakh, to Haru, his brother Joydeb?s son, police said.

 Shyamal has three daughters ? the eldest is 27 years old and is married, the second is 19 and the youngest 15.

 The teenager saw his dream slipping away from his hands when Suprabhat was born and Shyamal changed his mind, said additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh. ?Perhaps, due to this his nephew felt betrayed and planned the murder.?

 Suprabhat, a Class I student, went missing while returning from Baliadanga Primary School on Monday afternoon. 

 Police said he is believed to have been kidnapped somewhere between his house and school, after which he was strangled and his body dumped into the pond, hardly a hundred yards from his home. 

 The body has been sent for post-mortem.

 ?We found that the gunny bag was stuffed with heavy things like iron rods and implements used for farming in order to prevent the sack from floating. But, as the body became bloated, it forced the sack to surface,? the police official said.

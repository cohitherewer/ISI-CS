 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, Oct. 30: Over a lakh people in Nadia would get arsenic-free drinking water in two years, if the government delivers on its promise.

 Jyoti Basu today laid the foundation stone of a Rs 246-crore drinking water supply project at Bethuadahari, 125 km from Calcutta. Water from the Bhagirathi will be filtered at three places and distributed to Nakashipara, Kaligunj, Krishnagar and Nabadwip once the project is completed. Arsenic content in ground water at all these places is high. Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, the Union rural development minister who was present on the occasion, said 16,000 mouzas of eight Bengal districts have arsenic in groundwater. 

 Behrampore: Biren Mondal, a Class IV student, was electrocuted when he stepped on a live wire lying on the road at Banipur village in Raghunathgunj on Saturday evening. Police said 12-year-old Biren was carrying a bag full of bidi that his parents had made to a factory, about 250 km from Calcutta.

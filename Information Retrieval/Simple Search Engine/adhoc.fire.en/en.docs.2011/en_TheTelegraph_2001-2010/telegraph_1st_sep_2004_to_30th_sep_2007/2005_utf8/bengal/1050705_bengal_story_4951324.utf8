 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, July 4: A number of long-distance trains, including the Sealdah-New Delhi Rajdhani Express, were delayed today because of an obstruction by railway hawkers at Bidhannagar Road station in Eastern Railways Sealdah division.

 The hawkers were protesting after a person was run over by a train during an eviction drive.

 Another group obstructed trains at Ballygunge station in the Sealdah south section from 3.40 pm to 4.15 pm and at Bagha Jatin station from 4.10 pm to 4.25 pm.

 Calcutta: A delegation of the West Bengal Primary Teachers Association met governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi and brought to his notice the omission of two chapters devoted to Vidyasagar and Matangini Hazra from Kishlaya, a textbook for Bengali-medium schools. The delegation alleged that school education minister Kanti Biswas has turned a blind eye to the omission, which occurred in the academic year 2002-2003.

 Suri: Birbhum police on Sunday night recovered a five-year-old boy abducted from Uttar Pradesh. The boy was found in Nalhati village, 300 km from Calcutta, at the house of a person who worked at the abducted childs house.

 Bolpur: The government has taken up a programme on sex education and AIDS in Birbhum as part of a state-wide programme to educate school students about the disease. The programme, beginning at Bolpur High School on July 6, will be held in other schools subsequently.

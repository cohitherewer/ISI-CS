 Calcutta, Oct. 6: A section of students of the Institute of Post-Graduate Medical Education and Research at SSKM Hospital today gheraoed director Prabir Sur to protest against the suspension of four students accused of ragging.

 The four-hour agitation ended after the authorities dropped the word ragging from the notice and promised an impartial inquiry.

 The four second-year students suspended yesterday ? Gouranga Pramanik, Sukanta Nandy, Mriganka Saha and Tanmoy Das ? are supporters of the All India Democratic Students Organisation (AIDSO).

 A group of 70 first- and second-year students gheraoed the director from around 10 am. 

 They also boycotted classes and raised slogans in the directors room at the B.C. Roy Building on the hospital premises.

 A month ago, a section of first-year students had accused Ajay Kumar Mahato, a second-year student and an SFI supporter, of ragging.

 On Monday, Diptangshu Ganguly, a first-year student from Burnpur and an SFI supporter, was allegedly ragged by four seniors. 

 The victims father, Dipak Ganguly, lodged a complaint with the director the next day. 

 According to the complaint, Diptangshu was called on his mobile by the four to a room and told to perform obscene dances and other acts.

 On Tuesday, we received a complaint of ragging on a first-year student in the boys hostel and ordered an inquiry. We also asked the accused to vacate the hostel. A section of the students protested against the decision today but the matter was resolved after talks. The victim had since left the campus, Sur said.

 The accused students had a different version of the incident. 

 We complained against atrocities committed by SFI supporters and protested against a number of them ragging the juniors. The SFI is trying to malign our image by making false allegations, said Gouranga Pramanik, one of the accused and a member of the AIDSO unit at the institute.

 Refuting the charges, the vice-president of the state committee of the SFI, Ritobrata Banerjee, said: We welcome the decision of the authorities. The allegations levelled against us are not only baseless but also motivated.

 BRIEFS

 Hanskhali, April 18: Seven primary school headmasters have been served showcause notices for besieging and heckling a block development officer when he refused to disburse funds for midday meals at a higher rate than that fixed by the government.

 The demonstration at Hanskhali in Nadia, 75 km from Calcutta followed a circular saying allotment for meals has been raised from Re 1 to Rs 2 for each student. The headmasters thought it would be effective from March, though the circular mentioned April.

 Krishnagar: A 17-year-old schoolgirl died under mysterious circumstances at Bethudahari in Nadia on Monday. She was gasping for breath at the railway station when some labourers spotted her around 2 pm. They took her to hospital where she was declared dead. Blood was oozing out of her mouth and nostrils and her left hand was severed from her body. The girl was carrying HS English test papers.

 Midnapore: Two youths were crushed under the Digha-Shalimar Express on Monday morning at Durmuth in East Midnapore, about 180 km from Calcutta. Police said Chandan Dhauria and Bidhan Dhauria, both masons, were sleeping on the railway track.

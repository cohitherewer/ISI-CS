 Power pull and push

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 8: Worried there could a power crisis next summer, the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee regime has decided to take up special maintenance jobs in its power plants. 

 Power minister Mrinal Banerjee today said the demand and supply would run neck and neck next year and the state would largely be dependent on its share of supply from central sector plants. 

 On pen and paper, the state is supposed to get a total of 1000 MW from the National Thermal Power Corporation plant in Farakka and National Hydel Power Corporation unit in Chukha and the Damodar Valley Corporation. But it gets an average of 500-600 MW during the evening peak hour. 

 We are dependent on our share of 1,000 MW from the central sector power plants for the next summer. If we dont get it, we will have a problem. Anticipating a crisis next year, we have started a special maintenance job in our power plants, Banerjee said in the Assembly lobby. 

 To extract maximum benefit from power generated during peak hours, the government will also install time-of-the-day (TOD) meters for agricultural consumers. 

 If the farmer operates his pump at peak hour, he will have to pay more. The TOD meters will record the time of use of electricity by farmers.

 Those who will not use TOD meters will have to pay hefty deposits to the state electricity board. All this is to discourage farmers from running pumps between 6 pm and 10 pm when demand for electricity is highest, a power department official said.

 Banerjee said a professional consultant would be appointed to make recommendations on financial restructuring and improving quality of service to consumers. 

 The government has already planned a capacity addition of 1570 MW by 2007 to meet the growing demand due to rapid urbanisation, he said.

 We will add another 3,000 MW in the eleventh plan by adding units to existing plants and setting up a 1,000-MW plant in Katwa in Burdwan.

 Banerjee said the government had planned to raise the capacity of the Bakreswar plant by 420 MW. But it was shelved because Japanese loans fell through following the post-Pokhran sanctions.

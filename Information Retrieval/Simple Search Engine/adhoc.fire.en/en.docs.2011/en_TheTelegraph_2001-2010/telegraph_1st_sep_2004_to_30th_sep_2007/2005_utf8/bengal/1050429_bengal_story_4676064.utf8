 BRIEFS

 Burdwan, April 28: Two girls in school uniforms were found unconscious on a Katwa-Bandel local train this evening. 

 One of them was pronounced dead in hospital while the other was senseless till late night. From their books, one of the girls was identified as Arpita Biswas, a Class VIII student, and the other as Rumpi Pal of Class IX. Arpita is believed to be dead. A doctor said they may have been drugged. Passengers at Katwa, 180 km from Calcutta, saw them lying on the floor. ?They appeared to be from Balagarh High School in Hooghly,? said the stationmaster. 

 Calcutta: A high court division bench told advocate-general Balai Ray on Thursday that it was ?annoyed with? the state?s law-and-order situation. Cancelling the bail granted to four policemen in whose custody one Nitai Das had died in February 2002, the chief justice asked: ?How are the accused officers still performing duty?? The police had said Das committed suicide in the Bally police station lock-up. 

 Calcutta: The government announced the setting up of a ?knowledge and health village? in Durgapur. The Rs 600-crore project will include a hospital, medical, management and tech schools. 

 Krishnagar: Three officers of the government?s Haringhata dairy were caught stealing spares. Police said security officer Ajit Biswas and assistant livestock officers Sudip Roy and Tapan Das were part of a gang.

 Calcutta: Power supply at SSKM and Rabindra Sadan was disrupted for about half-an-hour as a kite got entangled in a CESC feeder line.

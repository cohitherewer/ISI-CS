 Fake note flood

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 30: Abdul Rezzak, a suspected ISI agent arrested for running a fake currency racket, has distributed more than a crore in the city market in the past couple of years.

 The CID today stumbled on the fact after picking up Rezzak, a Pakistani national, from a hideout in Mumbai late on Thursday night. 

 The police also came to know about Rezzak?s agents in the city and in Dhaka, through whom he had flooded the city markets with fake currency.

 Officials were tipped-off about Rezzak in the first week of March after arresting a former employee of a state-run blood bank from his Lake View Road apartment and recovering counterfeit currency worth Rs 22.5 lakh. The notes were in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.

 The police came to know that Shankar Acharya ?was to hand over the consignment to Rezzak a few hours after we raided his residence,? said an official.

 Rezzak had entered the city several times through Dhaka. He ?distributed the counterfeit notes through his agents in Jorasanko, Posta, Burrabazar and Narkeldanga,? said a CID official.

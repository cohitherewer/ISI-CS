 Truck crushes girl

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 22: A six-year-old girl was crushed to death under the wheels of a truck this morning at the intersection of Dilwar Jaan Road and Strand Bank Road in the North Port police station area.

 According to police, the incident took place when the girl, Priti Pathak, was collecting iron scrap in front of a godown. 

 ?The (driver of the) truck, moving backwards, did not notice her. The girl died on the spot and the driver fled,? said an official of the police station. ?It seems there was no helper to assist the driver when he was reversing.?

 The girl?s father, Nagendra, along with people from the locality, blocked traffic on both the roads for half-an-hour. The blockade was lifted after the police intervened.

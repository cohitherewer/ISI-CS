 HC lifts ban on Taslima

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 22: The high court today set aside the government notification banning Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasreens autobiography Dwikhandita, Amaar Meyebela.

 The book was banned in April 2004 on the assumption that, if allowed to be printed, published and marketed, it might hurt the sentiments of the Muslim community. 

 A three-judge special bench directed the government to return the books it had seized to its publisher.

 Justices Dilip Kumar Seth, Alike Kumar Basu and Soumitra Pal held that the ban was against the freedom of speech and expression. They felt that the book was on the social, economic and religious aspects of Bangladesh and will not affect the minds of the conscious people of our country.

 An overwhelmed Taslima, who was present when the judgment was delivered, said outside the court: It is the victory of freedom of speech and expression. I am really happy. Security personnel had her ringed when she spoke.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, the motivating force behind the ban, said the government would consider appealing a higher court after scrutinising the order.

 Taslimas joy was short-lived as the Jamiat-e-Ulama-e-Hind declared at a rally in the city that she would not be allowed to enter any district in Bengal. She has tarnished Islam in her book and must be punished, said its general secretary, Siddikullah Choudhury. 

 The Muslim Council of Bengal threatened to move the Supreme Court.

 Intent on moving the apex court, the state counsels prayed for a stay on the operation of the judgment for six weeks, but that was turned down.

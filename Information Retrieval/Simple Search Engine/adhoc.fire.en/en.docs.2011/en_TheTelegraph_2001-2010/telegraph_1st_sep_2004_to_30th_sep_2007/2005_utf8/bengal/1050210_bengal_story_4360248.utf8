 Growl on Left merger 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 9: The CPM?s three-day state conference kicked off today with the party general secretary snubbing the CPI?s idea of a united communist movement in the country. 

 ?Those who once called us splitters are now willing for a unification. But there should not be any bargain on the matter. If they (the CPI) are willing, let them join us,? Harkishen Singh Surjeet said after inaugurating the meet at Kamarhati, North 24-Parganas.

 He was reacting to the idea floated by CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan regarding unification for ?the greater communist movement in India?. The united communist party had split in 1964. 

 CPM state secretary Anil Biswas ruled out the likelihood of a merger. ?We can share a government with them, but it is not possible for us to merge with them until and unless some basic political and ideological differences between the parties are resolved,? he said.

 The two parties are also outside supporters of the Congress-led Centre. 

 Biswas placed political and organisational reports at the meeting and allayed fears about the party?s backing for the government?s industrial policies. ?Party members should not have any doubts about the government?s sincere efforts for rapid industrialisation,? he said. 

 Commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen, too, presented a document that contained the CPM brass? criticism of the health, panchayat and education departments. 

 Among those present were chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Jyoti Basu.

 Mobile banned

 The CPM state leadership has banned mobile phones at the conference venue. 

 ?I know everyone is carrying mobile phones in your pockets. Please keep your phones off during the conference,? Biman Bose, politburo member and Left Front chairman, told the delegates.

 Pay-up time 

 Calcutta, Feb. 25: The high court today asked a husband who prayed for anticipatory bail to first pay Rs 15,000 to his deserted wife, who had alleged torture. 

 On January 5, Hansu Bhawal, a homemaker from Bijpur, North 24-Parganas, lodged a complaint with police against her husband Mrinal, an Eastern Railway ticket collector. 

 Today, a division bench told Mrinal, who came to court apprehending arrest, to pay Rs 15,000 by March 3 and Rs 5,000 every month in future.

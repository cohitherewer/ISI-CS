 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, May 3: A debt-trapped betel leaf farmer electrocuted himself at Bazitpur in Nadia yesterday.

 Nisith Mondal, 23, had borrowed about Rs 1 lakh over the past two years as he could not find buyers for betel leaves he grew on a plot, 180 km from Calcutta, leased at Rs 7,000 a year. Neighbours broke open the door to his room after his mother raised an alarm. ?He was married six months ago, but his wife Rakhi had to be sent back to her parents in Tehatta as Nisith was unable to run the family,? the mother said. 

 This is the third death in a betel leaf farmer?s family in about two months.

 Calcutta: The high court has quashed proceedings of a criminal case pending with the Chinsurah court for 26 years without police having filed charges against any one of the accused. Two of the three have died of old age already. In 1979, Paresh Chandra Kar, a resident of Goghat in Hooghly, about 150 km from Calcutta, went to police alleging that postmaster Manoranjan Ghosal had withdrawn Rs 8,000 from his account by forging his signature. Villagers Bablu Kar and Harisadhan Pal were said to have helped him. Ghosal died in 2000 and Pal the next year. Then Bablu moved high court. Justice Pratap Roy said: ?If the prosecution is allowed to proceed, there is every possibility that it will take another decade to finish trial.?

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Jan. 24: The government today wrote to Delhi asking for a CBI probe into the assassination attempt on Subhas Ghisingh. 

 The Gorkha leader demanded a probe by the bureau when he met Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Sukna last week. On his way from a meeting in Delhi involving the state and the Centre, he was attacked near Pankhabari in February 2001. 

 Katwa (Burdwan): Debashis Sarkar, 30, was hacked to death last night during his wedding reception. Police said Sarkar, the owner of a grocery shop here, 180 km from Calcutta, tied the knot with Mou Pal on Friday. He was in a pool of blood minutes after some youths called him out of the hall.

 Howrah: Renuka Saha, 27, of Bantra died of burns tonight. Police said it could be suicide as her family was opposed to her ?affair?.

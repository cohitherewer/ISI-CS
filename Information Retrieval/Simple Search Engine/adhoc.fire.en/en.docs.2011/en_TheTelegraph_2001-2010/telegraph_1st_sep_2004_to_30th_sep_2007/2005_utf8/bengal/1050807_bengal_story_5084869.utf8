 Passenger ire at cheap flight staff

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 6: Passengers roughed up Air Deccan staff at Dum Dum airport today after two flights were delayed for several hours.

 The airlines Calcutta-Delhi flight this morning was delayed as the aircraft developed a technical snag.

 As a result, our Chennai flight, too, was affected, an Air Deccan official said. We did not have any extra aircraft to replace the faulty one with. The passengers got agitated and manhandled us.

 The passengers said the airline officials had fobbed them off with false information about how long the delay would be. The airlines people kept telling us the plane would take off within an hour, but we were stranded at the airport all through the day, said Naveen Gupta.

 The Delhi flight left in the evening and the one to Chennai at night.

 Since Air Deccan launched its Calcutta services about a year ago, it has been plagued by flight cancellations and delays. The no-frills airline attracts passengers because of its cheap fares.

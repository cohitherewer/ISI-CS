 CM pushes Salim case

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 22: Buddha- deb Bhattacharjee today launched another initiative to bring around Left Front partners and a section of his own party, who have been opposing his bid to get land in South 24-Parganas allotted to the Indonesia-based Salim Group.

 We (the government) should not be perceived to be neglecting agriculture, the chief minister said at a meeting of the Left allies. 

 Several of them, with support from a section of the CPM, are believed to be resisting the governments move to convert agricultural land fearing that industry would come up consuming large tracts of fertile farmland ? an impression that Bhattacharjee sought to shoot down.

 This was the chief ministers second interaction with the allies in the past 10 days. On the last occasion, too, the meeting was devoted to gauging the likely impact of the proposed Salim projects on agriculture. We are planning to increase the share of irrigated land from 68 to 75 per cent. So the question of neglecting agriculture or using up fertile land does not arise, he said.

 Bhattacharjee reiterated his pledge to only take over fallow or mono-crop land for the proposed economic zone (in South 24-Parganas) or the township (in Howrah).

 He added: We wouldnt touch fertile land for laying the 85-km, four-lane highway connecting the two 24-Parganas.

 His party colleague and front chairman Biman Bose accused the allies of trying to create an impression that our government is going in the wrong direction by pursuing the path of development. 

 Bose had earlier distributed among the partners a note from the chief minister clarifying the governments position. Today, he said: Weve received their opinions, but did not discuss anything on the projects at the meeting.

 Bhattacharjee also told the front leaders during the meeting that no Salim Group project has been finalised yet, except the two-wheeler factory at Uluberia in Howrah.

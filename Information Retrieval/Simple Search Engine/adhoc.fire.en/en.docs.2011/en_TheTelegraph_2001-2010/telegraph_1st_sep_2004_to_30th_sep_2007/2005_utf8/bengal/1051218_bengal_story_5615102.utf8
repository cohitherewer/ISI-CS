 Kids keep cops on toes

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Dec. 17: Crime in the city now has a young face.

 A band of boys, on a break-in spree across the city stealing from shops at the bidding of their bosses, are keeping police on their toes.

 The latest incident to add to the rising juvenile crime index took place early this morning at a mobile phone shop on 36, Ganesh Chandra Avenue in the central business district. 

 In the last three days, the gang has been involved in at least four cases of break-ins across the city. Their modus operandi is to strike late at night or early morning, lifting the shops shutters barely 6-10 inches to make enough space for a boy to crawl in.

 In their complaint, the owners of the cellphone shop ? Ved Prakash Tiwari and Kamal Krishna Rathi ? said when they came to open the shop this morning, they could hardly make out that someone had been there at night. The left side of the shops shutter was barely lifted and the lock was missing. It was only when they stepped inside that they realised they had been robbed, said Gadai Dey, the officer-in-charge of Bowbazar police station. 

 According to preliminary investigation, the boys entered the showroom near Hind Cinema, took the keys of an almirah from a chest of drawers and pocketed Rs 54,000. They did not touch any mobile phone. 

 The police said an insider must have tipped them off about where the keys and the money were kept.

 It appears that boys in the age group of 8 to 9 have been pressed into the job. Its done so neatly that one can hardly make out at first glance that someone has entered the shop, said Ajay Ranade, the deputy commissioner of police (port).

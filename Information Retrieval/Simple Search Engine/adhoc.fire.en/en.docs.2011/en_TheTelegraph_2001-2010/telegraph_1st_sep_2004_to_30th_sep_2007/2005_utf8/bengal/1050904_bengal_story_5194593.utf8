 Scrutiny bares HS warts

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 3: Nearly 10 per cent of the Higher Secondary examinees who had applied for post-publication scrutiny this year got enhanced marks, indicating that the mechanism followed by the state council for publishing results is far from satisfactory.

 Council officials today said nearly 23,126 of the more than four lakh candidates who had sat for the Higher Secondary examination this year had applied for post-publication scrutiny. Of these, nearly 2,220 candidates have had their marks increased.

 The West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education and the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education have been in the midst of a controversy over the past few years after several aggrieved examinees moved Calcutta High Court about poor marks. In 2004, more than five examinees had appealed to the court, demanding a review of their answer scripts.

 The problem persisted. The number of students who got enhanced marks in the post-publication scrutiny was less this year than last year. However, ideally not even a single student should be awarded less marks than he or she deserves, said a source in the school education system.

 Far more students could have got higher marks if they applied for the scrutiny this time. The current years scrutiny results show that nearly 2,220 examinees out of 23,126 were given less marks than they deserved, pointed out a senior teacher of a reputed higher secondary school.

 Under the scrutiny system, answer scripts are not re-examined. The papers are rechecked to ensure that marks have been allotted for all the questions the student has attempted. Council authorities try to find out whether the student has been allotted less marks because of human error or a computer-related fault as there have been instances of marks getting changed when data is fed into the computer.

 However, Gopa Dutta, the council president, is happy with this years scrutiny results. The number of applicants for scrutiny this year is much less than last year. This is an encouraging trend. It shows that the examinees now have greater faith in the council, she said.

 But school authorities, students and teachers are far from happy.

 Why should even a single student be allotted wrong marks? asked Arindam Mukherjee of a south Calcutta school who had his marks increased after the scrutiny. I would not have been given the additional marks had I not applied for the scrutiny, he said.

 Council officials feel human errors will be reduced and there will be more perfection in the wake of the governments decision to bifurcate the Higher Secondary.

 Girl of 5 raped by 50-year-old

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, June 14: A five-year-old girl was allegedly raped yesterday by a 50-year-old at Taherpur town. 

 Gour Roy, a vegetable vendor, lured her to his house promising chocolates. After she returned home weeping, a chocolate in hand, her farmer father Kalachand Mullick suspected something was wrong. 

 Her mother found her bleeding. She returned home and went straight to the bed. She was shivering and whimpering. When I asked her what happened, she did not reply.... But then she broke down and narrated the incident.

 Gour lives a few hundred yards from the Mullicks house. His daughter was married a few years ago and his wife Shyamali had gone to her parents with her 15-year-old son.

 Kalachands daughter was not taken to a hospital out of shame. He said: We treated her at home. We did not tell anyone what had happened.

 But the word got around and some of the neighbours asked Kalachand to lodge an FIR. 

 When he went to the Taherpur town police outpost, about 60 km from Calcutta, the personnel there refused to accept a complaint on the pretext that the inspector-in- charge was away. The residents then laid siege to the outpost for several hours. As tension mounted, the outpost sought help from the Ranaghat police station. 

 The officer-in-charge of Ranaghat asked Kalachand to lodge a complaint with him.

 Nadia has reported at least four rapes of children this year. Additional superintendent Biswarup Ghosh said: We have taken strong exception to the outpost officials attitude. We will seek an explanation. We are looking for Gour. 

 The girl has undergone a medical test.

 At Tehatta, about 150 km from Calcutta, a 19-year-old pregnant girl today brought charges of rape against her employer, a garment trader. Pinu Das Bairagya, also around 50, has been arrested.

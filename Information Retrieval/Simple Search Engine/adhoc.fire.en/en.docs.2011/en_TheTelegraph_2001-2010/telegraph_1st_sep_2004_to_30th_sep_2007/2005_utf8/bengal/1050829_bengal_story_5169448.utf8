 BRIEFS

 Jalpaiguri, Aug. 28: In a bid to check ragging, Jalpaiguri Polytechnic Institute has imposed more restrictions on first-year students.

 They would not be allowed to leave hostel without citing a reason. Its officer-in-charge, S. Bose, said: Something had to be done. It would give a clue to if ragging led to the exit. Parents of Indranil Mukhopadhyay, a first-year student from Calcutta, had taken him back after he had to be hospitalised following torture by seniors.

 Midnapore: Ranjit Das, 26, was arrested on Sunday for allegedly raping a seven-year-old. Police said he came to the girls house at Shyamsunderpur, 170 km from Calcutta, looking for her father. She was alone then.

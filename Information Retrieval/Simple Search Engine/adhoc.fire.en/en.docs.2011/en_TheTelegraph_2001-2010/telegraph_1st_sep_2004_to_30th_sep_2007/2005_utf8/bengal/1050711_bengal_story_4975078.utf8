 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, July 10: Four persons died today when a car they were travelling in collided with a lorry coming from the opposite direction near Pachpota at Chakda, about 60 km from Calcutta.

 Police said the persons, who are residents of Thane, were travelling to Howrah station on a Tata Sumo after spending holidays in Bagda in North 24-Parganas. The mishap took place when the Sumo tried to overtake a lorry which lost control and rammed into another lorry coming from Kalyani to Krishnagar. 

 Krishnagar: A student of Class V of a madarsa at Bhagobangola in Murshidabad left home and boarded the Sealdah-bound Lalgola passenger train on Saturday morning after his mother scolded and slapped him for viewing a Hindi film on television. Ten-year-old Saddam Hussain left home telling his mother he was going to school but boarded the train around 9 in the morning. After travelling about 80 km, Hussain got down at Krishnagar. When the Government Railway Police questioned him, he admitted that he had left home after being scolded by his mother.

 Krishnagar: Sanjit Mandol, 30, hanged himself early on Sunday morning, just three days before his marriage. Police said Mandol was a trader from Bethudahari in the Nakashipara police station area, about 130 km from Calcutta.

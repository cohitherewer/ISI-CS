 Aiyar fires rural salvo on projects

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Phansidewa (Darjeeling), May 14: Mani Shankar Aiyar today pulled up panchayat officials for not implementing development schemes.

 You have been in office for the past 10 months and do not yet know how much will be your budget and what projects you will take up this year, said the Union minister in front of Surjya Kanta Mishra, the state panchayat minister.

 This year, you have a fund allotment of Rs 5 crore and an additional Rs 1.5 lakh in untied funds. Have you prepared any schemes? Has anybody asked how this money will be spent? Aiyar asked block development officer Bikash Saha. Untied funds are meant to be spent on projects not covered under usual schemes.

 The CPMs Jaheda Khatun, a member of the Congress-led Bidhannagar-I panchayat, added fuel to the fire, alleging that decisions on Sishu Siksha Kendras were taken without her knowledge. I was told that branch members of my party were consulted and my opinion didnt matter, she said.

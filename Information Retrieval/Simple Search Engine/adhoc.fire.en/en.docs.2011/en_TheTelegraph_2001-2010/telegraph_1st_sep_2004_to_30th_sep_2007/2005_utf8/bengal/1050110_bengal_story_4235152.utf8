 BRIEFS

 Darjeeling, Jan. 9: Sandakhphu, about 38 km from here, and its neighbouring areas experienced snowfall today even as a constant drizzle brought down the temperature in Darjeeling. 

 The day temperature in the town hovered around 4 degrees and plummeted to around 2 in the evening. Tiger Hill, too, experienced light snowfall during the day. Sandakhphu, a trekkers? haven, is two inches under snow.

 Midnapore: South-eastern Railway has requested the state to waive the Vidyasagar Setu toll for passengers bound for Shalimar station. General manager R.R. Bhandari said in Kharagpur a complete station complex would be built in Shalimar to take some load off Howrah. Trains to Digha from Shalimar have been introduced recently.

 Krishnagar: Satyabrata De, 48, a deputy director in the animal resources development department, was killed and his daughters injured when a Matador hit his car on National Highway 34 on Sunday morning. He was driving when the accident occurred near Nadia?s Chakdah, 55 km from Calcutta. De?s children, aged 13 and 9, and a relative, Sujata Biswas, 25, were admitted to Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Hospital in Kalyani, where his wife Sangeeta is a nurse. 

 Purulia: Police swung into action following a call claiming there was a bomb inside CPM MP Basudeb Acharya?s house, 10 km away. The MP was in Delhi and the call proved to be a hoax.

 Durgapur: A truck spun off the road and killed a traffic constable and a minibus passenger at Gandhi More here. It first hit the policeman, who was trying to stop it for violating lanes.

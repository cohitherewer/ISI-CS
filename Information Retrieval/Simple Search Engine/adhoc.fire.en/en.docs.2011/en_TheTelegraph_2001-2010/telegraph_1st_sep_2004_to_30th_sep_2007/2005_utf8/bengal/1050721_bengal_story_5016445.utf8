 Strike fuels LPG supply crisis fears

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Will stocks last? 

 Calcutta, July 20: Homes in Bengal might face a cooking gas shortage if a transporters strike that has crippled the supply system is not resolved soon.

 The states bottling plants have stocks that will last for two days. If the strike still continues, consumers across the state will begin to feel the bite. 

 With Bengal refusing to invoke the Essential Services Maintenance Act (Esma) to acquire LPG tankers, the strike will hit the state the hardest. An Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) official had spoken to Bengals home secretary, but the state government remained firm in its stand that the stringent law would not be clamped. 

 States like Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan have accepted the proposal. 

 There are three phases in the LPG transportation system. First, the gas is brought from refineries to bottling plants. From there, the cylinders are taken to dealers and then to consumers.

 The strike has crippled the first leg of the system and gas is not being evacuated from refineries.

 While the states bottling plants are expected to dry up in the next couple of days, the Haldia refinery of the IOC will have to start burning its produce because of lack of storage space ? 2,500 tonnes of LPG is the maximum it can hold. This would mean a loss of Rs 45,000 for every tonne of gas it produces. 

 The daily consumption of cooking gas in the eastern region is pegged at 3,500 tonnes, out of which Bengal uses up 1,400 tonnes.

 The Haldia refinery produces 500 tonnes of LPG a day on an average while an equal volume is imported by the IOC-Petronas joint venture. The rest is procured from other sources like the IOC refinery at Barauni in north Bihar, GAIL pipelines at Bijapur in Uttar Pradesh and Oriya in Madhya Pradesh.

 There are 11 bottling plants in the state. Six of them are owned by the IOC, three by Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and two by Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd.

 The strike started on Monday morning with the Delhi-based Bulk Transporters Federation of India demanding changes in the tender, based on which a fresh contract will be prepared. The contract is due to come into effect from November.

 Husband held for death

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 14: Abira Ganguly, a 26-year-old college lecturer, was found hanging from a ceiling fan at her home in Howrah yesterday with her father alleging murder by her in-laws.

 Abiras husband Abir Ganguly and mother-in-law Rina Ganguly have been arrested on the charge of torturing her physically and mentally.

 Her father-in-law and a domestic help have fled the house on Netaji Subhas Road, Siddheswaritala.

 Abiras father Amarnath Mukherjee said his daughter used to help him with money and her in-laws were torturing her mentally for this.

 My son-in-law had said he was a freelance journalist but later we found out he was jobless. My daughter was practically the sole earner in the family, Mukherjee said.

 Abiras uncle Samarnath Mukherjee said she used to work very hard. She was a part-time teacher with a government school in Burdwan and a part-time lecturer with a private college in Howrah. She used to run a milk booth, too.

 Mukherjee also said: The Gangulys said she died between 4.30 pm and 5, but they never informed us. Around 8.30 pm, one of her neighbours called us to tell us of her death.

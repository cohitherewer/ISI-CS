 Train looted at gunpoint

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, April 23: Eight people this evening looted at gunpoint the passengers of the Down Katihar Passenger between Old Malda and Malda stations.

 The group took gold chains, wristwatches, cash and other valuables at gunpoint from 60 travellers and fled in the darkness.

 The miscreants entered the compartment at Old Malda station posing as passengers and started looting when the train left the station around 6.30 pm. The gang fled before it reached Malda station.

 Passengers gheraoed the stationmaster of Malda, A.P. Tirkey, alleging that the driver had stopped the train though there was no red signal.

 GRP inspector Satya Chakraborty said a probe has been ordered against the driver.

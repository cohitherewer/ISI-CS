 No more hearings, says shocked panel

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 9: The Delimitation Commission is unlikely to hold another public hearing in Bengal after Trinamul Congress supporters disrupted its proceedings thrice. 

 The commission will seek legal opinion before deciding on further action. However, in view of what happened, there is very little chance that it will hold another public hearing, said an official of the commission. 

 Its chairman, Justice (retired) Kuldeep Singh, is said to have been very shocked and hurt at the personal attacks at him by some Trinamul legislators during yesterdays hearing at Mahajati Sadan on the recasting of constituencies in Bengal. 

 Prior to coming here, Justice Singh had chaired hearings in Kerala, Pondicherry, Mizoram, Tripura and Goa. But he seemed to be completely shaken by the abusive language and sustained attacks made on him in Bengal, the official said. 

 State government officials said extensive footage of the proceedings being marred at all three venues ? Siliguri, Durgapur and Calcutta ? had been shot on behalf of the commission. 

 The several hours-long footage is being compiled in CDs to be presented as evidence. We have also scanned the written representations made to the commission. Of the 30,000-odd representations received, many appear to have been penned by the same hand. The commission might have these examined by forensic experts, said an official. 

 Missiles were hurled at the commission members at all venues by Trinamul supporters, who demanded that everyone who had turned up be heard individually.

 In view of yesterdays disturbance in Calcutta, a meeting of 10 associate members of the commission that was scheduled to take place on September 15 has been postponed to October 6. 

 The hearing at Mahajati Sadan had to be closed within five minutes of its start after Trinamul supporters started throwing bottles and other objects at Singh and his team, seated on the dais.

 Later, in a statement, the commission expressed deep anguish at these unfortunate incidents.

 Unfazed, Trinamul leaders today said they had done no wrong by voicing their protest against the manner in which their suggestions were being ignored. We cannot accept that delimitation of Assembly segments will be carried out at the diktat of the ruling CPM. The Trinamul Congress is the principal Opposition party and its views have to be taken into acc-ount, said Pankaj Banerjee, the leader of Opposition in the Assembly.

 State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said the delimitation process could not be completed before the 2006 Assembly elections.

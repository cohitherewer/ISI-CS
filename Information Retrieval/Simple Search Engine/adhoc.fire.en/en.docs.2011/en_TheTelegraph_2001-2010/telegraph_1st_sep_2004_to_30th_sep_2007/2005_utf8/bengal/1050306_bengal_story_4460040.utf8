 Death terms revive debate

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 5: Capital punishment is back under the spotlight, a day after Calcutta High Court upheld a trial court verdict sentencing three persons to death. 

 A section of lawyers today said death penalty should not be awarded as it is being debated across the country.

 The National Law Commission had recently sent a circular to all state governments, legislators and members of Parliament seeking their views on abolishing capital punishment or whether its mode of execution should be changed.

 On Friday, a division bench of Calcutta High Court approved a city sessions court verdict and sentenced to death Aloke Nath Dutta and two others for murdering Aloke?s brother Biswanath. 

 ?When several nations have already taken the decision to stop death sentences, the Indian judiciary should review its law,? said advocate Joymalya Bagchi, who pleaded for one of the accused.

 Bagchi has been campaigning against capital punishment since he defended Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was hanged to death for raping and murdering a schoolgirl.

 Bagchi said he would move the Supreme Court and request it to review the judgment.

 Supporting Bagchi?s view, colleague Jayanta Narayan Chatterjee said: ?The National Law Commission has already sought opinions from the Centre, various state governments, the Supreme Court and also high courts on whether capital sentence should continue. So, at this time, it is inappropriate to award death by hanging to anyone. Until the commission reaches a conclusion, the courts should not award capital punishment.? 

 High court sources said that in response to the law commission?s circular, a majority of the judges had expressed their objections to capital punishment. 

 A group of judges said if capital punishment continues to exist, the guilty should be killed either by a lethal injection or sedatives.

 However, a senior high court judge defended the verdict, saying ?death penalties are being awarded only in cases where the crime is the rarest of the rare?.

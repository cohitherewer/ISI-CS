 Science magnet for toppers

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, Jan. 22: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government, concerned over the growing tendency among meritorious students to opt for subjects other than physics, chemistry and mathematics, has lined up a string of programmes to urge toppers to pursue a career in pure science.

 A steering committee under the chairmanship of the chief minister will organise science seminars, workshops, exhibitions, audio-visual shows, quiz contests, cultural programmes, science jathas and rallies throughout the state to target Madhyamik and higher secondary students.

 Officials said the programmes would be organised in urban areas and remote villages. Several organisations such as Bigyan Mancha, the Science Association of Bengal, Bangiya Vigyan Parishad and Students Health Home have been roped in to make the programmes a success.

 The move comes in the wake of a study by the science and technology department that revealed a poor response from meritorious students to the study of pure science.

 ?We found that those who top the higher secondary examination have been opting for IIT, medical and engineering courses and computer science. Students who have performed better than the average prefer business administration and vocational courses,? said the secretary of the science and technology department, Jawhar Sircar.

 ?The study also revealed that at best 10 to 15 per cent of the brilliant students are eager to study pure science. Even four years ago, at least 50 per cent of the toppers used to prefer pure science with the aim of becoming a research scholar or a scientist,? he said.

 ?But the scenario has undergone an alarming change. Many good students now would rather opt for even a diploma course than chemistry honours,? said Sircar.

 ?We have discussed the matter with educationists and scientists who apprehend a big void in the study of pure science if something is not done to motivate meritorious students. This will adversely affect technology. Research and development will be hampered if we fail to bring meritorious students to the field of elementary science,? he said.

 ?Most of the toppers are now opting for either medical or technical subjects and we have to find out why they are not showing any interest in the study of pure science,? said Presidency College principal Amitava Chatterjee.

 ?A few years ago, students getting more than 80 per cent in the higher secondary examination used to seek admission here in the pure science stream. But today the number is very few. I think students now want to study only job-oriented subjects,? said the principal of Moulana Azad College, Chandidas Mukherjee.

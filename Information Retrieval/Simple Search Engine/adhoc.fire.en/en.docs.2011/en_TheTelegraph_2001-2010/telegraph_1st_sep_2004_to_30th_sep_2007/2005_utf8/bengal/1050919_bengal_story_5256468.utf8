 Do-little govt gets lashing from doctors

 OUR BUREAU

 Sept. 18: A day after Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee admitted that the condition of government hospitals was appalling and invited entrepreneurs to set up private facilities, the Indian Medical Association slammed Writers Buildings for denying proper infrastructure to its own healthcare units.

 Infrastructure is poor in state-run hospitals and doctors have to work with old equipment. Instead of improving the infrastructure, the government always blames us, said Sudipto Roy, the IMAs all-India president, while addressing a conference organised by the association and ESI Hospital in Durgapur. 

 How can it expect better services from us without providing modern facilities in the hospitals? he asked. 

 Roy claimed that around 10,000 doctors were sitting idle as the government had failed to provide them jobs. Posts are lying vacant at rural and district hospitals, but fresh doctors are not being appointed there. The government says that doctors are not willing to work in the districts and remote areas but that is not true.

 The government, he alleged, was not serious about improving the rural healthcare system. How will doctors work in rural hospitals if there is no infrastructure? 

 Roy said the chief minister was wrongly briefed that doctors were not giving their best in hospitals. We can do wonders if provided with modern infrastructure. The health department is not doing it and blaming us, he added. 

 IMA members also blasted the government for its total failure in tackling the dengue outbreak. Roy said doctors in rural hospitals had been rendered handicapped by the non-availability of medicines.

 Director of health services Prabhakar Chatterjee, now visiting Malda, said tonight that 2,927 people have so far been afflicted with the disease in the state with 153 new cases being detected in the past 24 hours. Nineteen people have died. 

 Governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi had visited Bhatpara State General Hospital in North 24- Parganas yesterday and expressed concern over the lack of facilities there. Nearly 200 people are undergoing treatment at the hospital. They told the governor that there were not enough medicines. 

 The health department has sought updated reports from all hospitals about the condition of dengue patients.

 At the convention today, the IMA president also spoke on the poor pay for doctors of ESI Hospitals. Doctors working at ESI hospitals earn between Rs 800 and Rs 1,000 a month while doctors at other government hospitals draw between Rs 15,000 and 20,000, he said.

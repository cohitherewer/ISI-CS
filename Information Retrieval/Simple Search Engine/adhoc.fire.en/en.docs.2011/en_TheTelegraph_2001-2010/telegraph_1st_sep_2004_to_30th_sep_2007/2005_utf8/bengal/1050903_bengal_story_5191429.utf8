 Allies plot union

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 2: The minor partners in the Left Front ?the CPI, RSP and the Forward Bloc ? are in touch with each other and planning a common strategy to counter Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees decision to convert farmland for industry.

 With senior CPM leaders like Jyoti Basu, Anil Biswas, Biman Bose and Bhattacharjee away in Delhi for the partys politburo and central committee meetings that began today, the allies are apparently plotting their own moves.

 After they return to Calcutta on Monday, the CPM leaders will meet the partners and the chief minister will brief their leaders about his recent trip to Singapore and Jakarta and pact with the Indonesia-based Salim Group.

 Ahead of the front meeting, the CPM brass will meet the Bloc and RSP leaders separately to gauge their opposition to Bhattacharjee in allowing the Salim Group to set up shop here. 

 The CPM has already held talks with the CPI and asked it to submit an alternative to Bhattacharjees industrialisation drive. It is learnt that the CPI had criticised the chief minister, who is determined to convert agricultural land for industry. 

 Sources in the front said the CPM does not want any resistance from allies over the industrialisation. 

 The partners, however, were tight-lipped about their plans. We will meet the CPM leaders on September 5 and express our views, said Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh. The RSP and CPI leaders said much the same and did not rule out talks between themselves before the front meeting.

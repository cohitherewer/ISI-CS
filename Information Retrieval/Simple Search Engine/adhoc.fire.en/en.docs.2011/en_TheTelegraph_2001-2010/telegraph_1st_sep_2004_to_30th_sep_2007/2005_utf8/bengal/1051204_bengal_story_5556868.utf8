 Trader stabs wife after tiff

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 3: A trader today stabbed his wife, left the woman bleeding in front of their two young children and killed himself by jumping into a pond, 26 km from his Regent Park home.

 Police said Munni and Babu were waiting for their mother to call them for breakfast this morning. Instead, they heard her scream. When they rushed to their parents room, a ghastly sight unfolded.

 Munmun was lying on the floor with her throat slit open as their father stood in a corner clutching a broken shard of glass, dripping with blood.

 When the siblings ? Munni is eight years old and Babu is 12 ? cried out in fright, their father turned around and fled.

 Munmun, in her early 30s, was stabbed by husband Amit Das in their Dakshinpara home in the Regent Park area after the couple had a tiff, the police said.

 Amit, a trader who supplied building material, smashed a glass on a table and plunged a broken piece into his wifes throat.

 When the two children raised a hue and cry, Amit threw the glass away and fled, a police officer said.

 Neighbours rushed to the house and took Munmun to M.R. Bangur Hospital. When doctors examined her, she was unconscious but gasping. They tried their best but she succumbed to injuries, said S. N. Gupta, the South 24-Parganas superintendent of police.

 In Baharanpur, under Bishnupur police station, Amit called someone from a public telephone booth. His conversation raised the booth-owners suspicion and he tried to catch hold of him. But Amit gave him the slip. 

 Hours later ? around 9.30 pm ? his body was fished out of a pond. The police said he had probably used a blade to slit his throat before jumping into the pond. 

 Munmuns murder was a fallout of a quarrel between the couple over a trivial issue, Gupta said.

 An officer of Regent Park police station said the Dass neighbours had said they heard the couple quarrelling this morning.

 Both brother and sister are still in trauma. Munni told us that she saw her mother was on the floor and the bloodstained glass was in her fathers hand, said an officer of Regent Park police station.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, May 10: The government has finalised its new power subsidy scheme for industry in areas under the state electricity board. 

 The government will honour its commitment to existing industry. For new units, power will be subsidised only in Darjeeling, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, the Dinajpurs, Malda, West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia. 

 Krishnagar: Bhola Pal, a realtor in Kalyani accused of murder, was caught on Monday night living happily in a hospital instead of a prison cell since being remanded in jail custody in February. He allegedly threatened to ruin Dr N.K. Kanjilals career unless declared ?unfit?. Kalyani inspector-in-charge S.N. Das found Pal in a general ward of Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital when he should have been in a prisoners ward. Held for the murder of a CPM leader of Chakdah, Pal had complained of chest pain and got himself hospitalised. 

 Calcutta: A fire broke out at a commercial-cum-residential building on Wood Street on Tuesday afternoon. Police said faulty concealed wiring caused the fire.

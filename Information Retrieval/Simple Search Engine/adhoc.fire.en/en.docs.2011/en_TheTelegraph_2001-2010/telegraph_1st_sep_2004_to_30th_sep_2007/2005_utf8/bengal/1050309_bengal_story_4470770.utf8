 Tourist season worries govt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 8: The government today expressed ?serious concern? over the threat to paralyse the hills.

 Officials said it could plunge the hills into another round of turmoil. ?The situation is very fluid in the hills in the wake of the bandh threat. We are more worried about tourists who flock there during summer,? home secretary Amit Kiran Deb said tonight.

 The district administration has been asked to take all precautions to ensure peace during the three-day strike next week. ?We have already alerted the district magistrate,? Deb added.

 Jyoti Basu expressed the CPM?s concern over the turn of events. ?I don?t know what will happen to the people in hills. I hope Darjeeling does not return to those days when over a hundred of our supporters were killed. There was no peace in the hills for months in the early 1980s.? 

 Basu, who was the chief minister when the Gorkha agitation raged, said Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has already spoken to Subash Ghisingh to discuss his demands. ?I don?t understand why he (Ghisingh) is going back to bandhs to press for his demands when Buddha (Bhattacharjee) is in regular touch with him ,? he added.

 Writers? Buildings sources said the chief minister spoke to senior officials, including chief secretary Asok Gupta and Deb, over the impasse. 

 State CPM secretary Anil Biswas felt the GNLF?s threat was ?unexpected? when both the state government and the Centre are carrying out ?regular discussions with Subash Ghisingh?.

 ?We still hope that the problem in the hills will be sorted out,? he added. 

 Sources said the party?s Darjeeling unit secretary, S.P. Lepcha, called up his bosses at Alimuddin Street to enquire about the course of action in the event of a prolonged bandh.

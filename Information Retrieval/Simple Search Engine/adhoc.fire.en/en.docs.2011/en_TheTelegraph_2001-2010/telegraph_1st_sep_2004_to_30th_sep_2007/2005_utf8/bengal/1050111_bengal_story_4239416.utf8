 Karat in ordinance caution

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 10: A day after Jyoti Basu advocated patience regarding the Centre, the CPM leadership charged the Congress-led government with initiating measures to execute the party?s own agenda. 

 Party politburo member and general-secretary-in-waiting Prakash Karat said: ?Previous Congress governments would often bypass Parliament and promulgate ordinances in disregard of popular expectations. This is a very old habit of the Congress. We called it the Congress ordinance raj.? 

 The Congress? role came up for discussion at the three day-CPM central committee meeting that ended today. The committee came down heavily on Manmohan Singh?s United Progressive Alliance government for showing the familiar ?penchant? for ordinances. 

 Karat, however, added that the expression of unhappiness did not mean it was considering drastic steps like withdrawing support from the alliance. ?But let it be known that we are unhappy at the manner in which the UPA government is pushing measures beneficial to big business and foreign capital while delaying and refusing to take measures that concern the interests of the working class and the working people,? Karat said.

 He also expressed displeasure over the Centre?s refusal to restore the rate of interest for the employees? provident fund up to 9.5 per cent. ?Despite promises of active consideration ? nothing has been done. At the same time, the government is going ahead with the privatisation of pension funds of government employees as seen in the setting up of the Pension Regulatory and Development Authority. In such matters, the government resorts to the ordinance, which is undemocratic because the budget session of the Lok Sabha is due in February.? 

 The CPM today made it clear that Karat would replace general secretary H.K.S. Surjeet at the party congress in April. His appearance before the media served a pointer to the change of guard. 

 Karat said the CPM will contest 11 seats in Jharkhand, 5 in Haryana and 14 in Bihar.

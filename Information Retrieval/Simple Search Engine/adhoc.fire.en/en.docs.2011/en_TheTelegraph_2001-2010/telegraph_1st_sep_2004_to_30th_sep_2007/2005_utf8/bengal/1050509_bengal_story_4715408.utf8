 Calcutta, May 8: Directed by the Centre, the state government has started preparing a satellite map to assess the damage caused by the Boxing Day tsunami in the Andaman and Nicobar islands. 

 The state science and technology department has already formed a team comprising scientists and geophysicists for the purpose. 

 A train of killer waves claimed at least 3,000 islanders on December 26. About 5,000 people reportedly went missing and tens of thousands of buildings were demolished. 

 The worst affected areas were Car Nicobar, Mayabandar, Rangat, Diglipur and the Nancowrie group of islands.

 Several agencies, from the state as well as the Centre, visited the islands after the disaster for an initial assessment of the damage and the Geological Survey of India is working to assess the land pattern after the tsunami.

 ?The Centre assigned us the task of preparing the map and has provided an initial fund of Rs 20 lakh. Weve started work and it is expected to be completed in six months, said the principal secretary of the science and technology department, Jawhar Sircar.

 The move, according to Sircar, is aimed at identification of the locations where major damage was recorded and preparing a database. ?This map and the data will help the government and other agencies to take up development projects to rebuild the islands. It will also help us take precautionary measures, he said.

 Scientists in the department said remote-sensing methods would be used to prepare the map. It will help to assess change of land pattern, erosion of land and loss of property. 

 The map will also help to identify the low-lying areas of the Andamans.

 ?After completing the map, we will visit the islands for physical verification to confirm our findings. Besides, we will also see whether it is possible to prevent such disasters in future, said Partha Chakraborty, the principal scientist in the department.

 Government officials said they would also verify whether coastal regulations were followed while constructing buildings. According to Coastal Regulation, 2001, permanent constructions are prohibited within 500 metres of the sea. There should not be any settlement in that belt, called the coastal regulation zone.

 ?A preliminary survey after the tsunami revealed that a number of constructions violated the regulations. Had there been no construction within 500 metres of the sea, the loss of lives and property would have been much less, said a scientist.

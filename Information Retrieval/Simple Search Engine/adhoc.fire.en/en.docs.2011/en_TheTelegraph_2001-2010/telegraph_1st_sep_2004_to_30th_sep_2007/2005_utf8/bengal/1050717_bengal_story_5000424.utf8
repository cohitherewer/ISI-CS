 Cataract gets young amp; deadly

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR 

 Calcutta, July 16: Rajesh Sharma is just 35. When he started complaining of blurred vision, family members thought that he must be having the usual power-related problems. 

 That changed soon after a visit to an ophthalmologist, where tests revealed that he was suffering from cataract.

 Cataract has emerged as the most major cause for blindness after reflective errors. Doctors in the city are urging people to go for extensive tests as recent cases have revealed that one in 10 cataract-affected patients is actually below 40. 

 Cases of cataract have increased 30 per cent in two to three years, said Jyotirmoy Dutta, the head of ophthalmology at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital.

 A cataract is a clouding of the eyes lens. The lens, made mostly of water and protein, is built to let light pass through and focus on the retina. Sometimes protein clumps cloud small areas of the lens, blocking light from the retina. 

 Doctors say that in the early stages, a cataract may not cause any problem. But it might grow larger and block more of the lens, making it difficult to see. 

 A cataract does not spread from one eye to another, though many people develop cataracts in both eyes.

 About 1,000 cases of cataract are reported in the city every year out of which about 70 per cent patients see specialists at a very late stage. 

 Doctors say they are more concerned with cataract affecting the younger age group. Normally, the disease affects people in their 60s or 70s but someone below 50 getting affected by cataract is a major cause of concern, said Biplab Saha of Susrut Eye Foundation. Doctors like Saha attribute stress and rise in diabetes among the young as the main reason behind cataract. 

 Dutta said: Steroids and constant exposure to pollution also affects the eye adversely. Awareness among the people must be increased.

 Father killed in sons post-mortem

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, May 15: A post-mortem report in his name instead of his dead sons has landed 50-year-old Dulal Sarkar in a muddle.

 Dayal, 30, died under mysterious circumstances last December, but Dulal found his own name in the report which, however, got the name of his father right ? Noaich Sarkar. 

 A truck driver, Dayal was found lying near a drain in Ranaghat town on December 18 midnight. 

 But Dulals efforts to lodge an FIR in connection with the death failed to evoke a response from the Ranaghat police station as it refused to accept the post-mortem of a living person. 

 The farmer, a resident of Ainstala in Ranaghat, 65 km from Calcutta, had applied for the report on his own. 

 The report he got early this month mentioned that the body bore marks of external injury and observed that there was a possibility of murder. But Dayals death could not be investigated with Dulals post-mortem report.

 As of now, the report is not genuine as it bears the name of someone living. So, we advised him (Dulal) to have it corrected, said Suvendu Chatterjee, a Ranaghat court lawyer. 

 Dulal said he was at a loss. I want a thorough investigation into my sons death but I cannot demand that. The post-mortem report has been made in my name. How I dont know. 

 He now has to approach the authorities of Ranaghat Subdivisional Hospital, where the report was drawn up. The doctors there will have to redraw the report, matching their observations with the original. 

 It will take another four or five months to do it. First, the hospital will have to carry out an inquiry into the mistake. Responsibility will have to be fixed on who sent in the wrong information? whether it was the doctor or the police, said an officer at the Ranaghat police station.

 I dont know whether I will have any energy left in me to pursue the case then, Dulal said.

 Nadia police chief R. Rajsekharan said he will ask the Ranaghat police to ensure that the report was corrected as soon as possible. But I must also add that without the genuine post-mortem report, we cannot proceed.

 According to the health authorities, the error was on the part of the medical officer or ward master, who fill in the data in a form. As soon as we receive the faulty report, they will be showcaused, said Mohan Basu, Nadias deputy chief medical officer.

 Twin industry hubs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Jan. 14: The Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority today unveiled plans to set up industrial complexes at Kanksa and Jamuria, together measuring about 1,700 acres. 

 The authority will acquire 1,000 acres along National Highway 2 in Kanksa near Durgapur, about 200 km from Calcutta, and 700 acres at Jamuria in Asansol, 240 km from Calcutta. The premises will accommodate sponge iron units and about 25 other small-scale industries and employees? quarters. 

 Chairman of the authority and cottage and small-scale industries minister Bansagopal Chowdhury today said several small entrepreneurs are interested in setting up units in the Asansol-Durgapur industrial belt. 

 ?But we could not offer them land as the authority did not have any in its possession. We have now urged the Centre to hand over to the state plots belonging to the closed public sector units,? Chowdhury said.

 ?We have already decided to use the land of closed Bengal government units?We expect Delhi to take a similar decision.?

 The minister estimated the scale of investment in the twin complexes to the tune of Rs 1,150 crore. He added that he was determined to revive the repute of the region as industrial.

 In the past decade, the twin cities of Asansol and Durgapur witnessed the gradual collapse of several public sector undertakings and desertion of the townships housing employees of these organisations.

 The sprawling Mining Allied Machinery Corporation (MAMC) colony in Durgapur is now in a shambles and the factory, which was run by the Centre, closed. The situation is much the same at the townships of Bharat Opthalmic Glass and Fertiliser Corporation of India.

 However, about 500 acres close to the proposed complexes have already been taken over for new industries. Chowdhury said the authority will provide the infrastructure necessary to develop the new premises.

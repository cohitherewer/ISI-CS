 Move to cut varsity workload

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 5: Reduction of workload in state-aided universities appears imminent with the government showing indications of accepting the recommendations of a central committee on granting of autonomy to undergraduate colleges.

 The universities are now saddled with too many colleges under their wings.

 School education minister Kanti Biswas is the convener of the committee set up by the Central Advisory Board on Education (CABE). 

 The committee has submitted the final report to the Centre on June 29. The CABE will meet in Delhi on July 14 and July 15 to discuss the recommendations.

 The workload of universities has to be reduced if they have to work effectively, Biswas said. We do not support setting up of private universities. Instead, we have suggested granting more autonomy to undergraduate colleges to minimise work pressure on the universities.

 The panel felt the need to reduce pressure on the varsities because of an increase in the number of students and also an increase in the number of courses in new areas being launched by the universities.

 Universities should concentrate more on research activities instead of holding undergraduate examinations, the minister said. Calcutta University alone holds over 600 examinations annually.

 On the other hand, there are colleges like Presidency and St Xaviers, which have rich infrastructure and the potential for research and technology development. They should be allowed to enjoy autonomous status in respect of academic, administrative and financial matters, the committee observed.

 Biswas said the government will start working on the issue of granting autonomy to some of the undergraduate colleges in Bengal, including Presidency College in Calcutta, soon after the CABE gives its views on the committees recommendations. 

 Calcutta University alone has more than 150 undergraduate colleges under it.

 Biswas said the committee has dealt elaborately on how varsities can improve their financial condition but has asked them to ensure that fee hikes for students are not exorbitant.

 Left set to gain from seat recast

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 9: As final touches are being given to the delimitation of the 294 Assembly segments in Bengal, it is becoming clear that the CPM and its allies will stand to gain from the exercise.

 Next years Assembly polls are to be held with the constituencies redefined. The idea behind delimitation was to have Assembly segments of roughly the same population.

 The exercise was last held in 1976, on the basis of the 1971 census. This time, the 2001 census is the basis.

 Although there has been no significant rise in the population of Calcutta, that of the districts around the city has increased. Rise in population is also discernable in north Bengal.

 Calcutta, which had 21 Assembly seats, will be left with only 11 after delimitation. Of the 21 seats, the Congress and the Trinamul Congress had bagged 13. Even if the Opposition bags all the 11 seats in next years polls, it will be two short of the previous tally.

 Sealdah, Tollygunge, Cossipore, Bowbazar and Alipore, which are now represented by Congress or Trinamul legislators, are being merged with other Assembly segments where the ruling party is stronger. 

 Of the states 18 districts, except three ? Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri and Howrah ? the number of Assembly seats will change in all others. However, the total number of seats in Bengal ?294 ? will remain unchanged.

 Red bastions Burdwan, Purulia and Bankura will see a marginal cut in seats. The three districts together will have four seats less. Burdwan had 26 seats and will get 25. Bankura had 13 seats and will now have 12. Purulia, which had 11 seats, will get 9.

 Abdul Mannan of the Congress, who is also a member of the delimitation committee, alleged that the Left Front administration had influenced the delimitation process. The committee has to depend on the bureaucrats of the state government, most of whom are loyal to the CPM, he said.

 Echoing him, leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee said: We find that in the name of delimitation, constituencies where the Opposition is strong are either being wiped out or merged with the areas where the CPM and its allies are strong.

 But CPM state secretary Anil Biswas denied the allegations. We dont depend on restructuring of the Assembly seats. We depend on our organisational strength to fight an election.

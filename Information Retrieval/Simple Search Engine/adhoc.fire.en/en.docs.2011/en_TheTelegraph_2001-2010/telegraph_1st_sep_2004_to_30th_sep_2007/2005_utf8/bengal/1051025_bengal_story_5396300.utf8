 BRIEFS

 Behrampore, Oct. 24: Twenty-year-old Mousumi Ghosh and her daughter Manty were yesterday burnt to death allegedly by her husband Bifal at Gouripur in Murshidabad, 190 km from Calcutta.

 Police started a case after Mousumis father Ashoke Ghosh lodged a complaint saying his daughter was murdered as he could not give Bifals family Rs 10,000 as dowry. Bifal and his parents are absconding.

 Krishnagar: Local CPM leaders will submit a memorandum to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee demanding that industries be set up on government land in and around Ranaghat and Kalyani. He would be here on November 6.

 Calcutta: The government has decided to lift its embargo on the appointment of the next of kin of schoolteachers who die in harness. Education officials in the districts have been asked to prepare a list of candidates who could not be appointed because of the bar imposed in 1998.

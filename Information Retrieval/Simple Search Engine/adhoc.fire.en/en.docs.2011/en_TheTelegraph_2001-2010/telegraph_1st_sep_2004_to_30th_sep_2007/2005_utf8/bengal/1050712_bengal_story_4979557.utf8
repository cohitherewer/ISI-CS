 Three women silent assassins

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Calcutta, July 11: Three women were at the forefront of the twin strikes that shook Bengal, or at least its administrators.

 Suchitra, Jamuna and Khepi, who are in their mid-20s and had apparently been handpicked from villages in West Midnapore and Bankura, led their male colleagues during the operations at Majhgeria and Dulukdihi. 

 We have come to know their profiles. All three went through hardcore training at camps organised by top Maoist guerrillas from Andhra Pradesh, said a CID officer.

 All three opened fire at the victims from semi-automatic weapons and all the bullets hit their targets. It shows, they not only went through commando-like training but must have also ranked high in tests, said an officer of the CIDs Special Combat Force, which was formed to fight the extremists.

 An officer of the special force said Koteshwar Rao alias Kishanji, the chief of the Naxalites action squad in Jharkhand and Bengal, selected the women because of their excellent record and killer instinct. 

 In photographs recovered from the Konnagar hideout of CPI (Maoist) politburo member Sushil Roy, we saw how punishment is meted out by the Maoists in gana adalat (peoples court), said the officer. The three women have killed many in these adalats. They were also selected for the twin strikes because of their daring.

 According to the police, Suchitra and Jamuna led the gang at Dulukdihi while Khepi was at Majhgeria. 

 The other rebels shouted slogans but the women did not utter a single word ? they claimed their prey and walked away, said an officer quoting local people.

 Earlier intelligence had mentioned the presence of women in rebel ranks but they were seen accompanying the guerrillas, not leading strikes, the officer said.

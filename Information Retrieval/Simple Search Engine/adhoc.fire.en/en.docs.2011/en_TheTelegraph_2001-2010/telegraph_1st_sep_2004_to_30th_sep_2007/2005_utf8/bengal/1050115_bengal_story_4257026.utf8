 Bagdogra

 Siliguri, Jan. 14: The state government is set to kick off fresh talks with Delhi on the possible international status for Bagdogra airport.

 Sources said the issue, which had been put on the backburner, has come to the fore again after the Singapore and Thailand governments showed an interest in operating flights through Bagdogra. Kathmandu and Thimphu had earlier agreed to operate passenger and cargo flights, too. 

 Urban development minister and local MLA Asok Bhattacharya said the state will again knock the Centre?s doors for Bagdogra?s upgrade.

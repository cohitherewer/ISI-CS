 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, March 14: Higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty today said he had reservations about the National Accreditation and Assessment Council, which grades universities and colleges on the basis of performance. 

 ?Valuation made by the NAAC is not always correct. I also conveyed my observations to the NAAC representatives during my last meeting with them,? Chakraborty told the Assembly. Only three colleges in the state have been graded A+ by the council. Calcutta and Jadavpur universities have been awarded five-star status. 

 Krishnagar: A day after a 13-year-old housewife committed suicide allegedly because of lack of food , the Nadia administration initiated an inquiry to find out if the death was indeed linked with poverty. Tehatta subdivisional officer Anindya Biswas on Monday visited the village in Karimpur, about 190 km from Calcutta, where Phulan Sardar apparently hanged herself, and spoke to residents to ascertain how poor the Sardars were. Her mother told police Phulan committed suicide after she and her husband, a betel leaf farmer, went without food for four days.

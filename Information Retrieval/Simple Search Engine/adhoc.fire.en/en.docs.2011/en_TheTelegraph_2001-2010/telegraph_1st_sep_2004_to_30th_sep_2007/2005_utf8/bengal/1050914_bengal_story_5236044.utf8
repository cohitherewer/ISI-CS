 Chill out, naturally

 - Pop 

 a can, not for a cola, but some cool coconut water 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 13: Come Puja, Calcutta will get a taste of canned coconut water.

 No more looking frantically at street corners for the man with the green mountain, often on the back of his rickety bicycle. 

 A 250 ml can of Benfresh, with packaged coconut water, will be available for Rs 12 in the city from October. A North-24 Parganas-based concern has tied up with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and the Union agriculture department to commercialise it.

 We set up our plant at Hasnabad, about 70 km from Calcutta, two years ago. During season, farmers sell coconuts at 80 paisa to a rupee a piece to local people. However, the same green coconut is often sold in the city at Rs 5 or 6. Now, we want to process and sell it in tinned cans especially imported from Malaysia, said Amitava Sharma, the chairman of Awadhoot Agro-products. 

 DRDO had developed the technology to process and preserve coconut water for soldiers manning the borders of Kashmir, where water is frozen throughout the year. 

 The real challenge before us was to extend the shelf life of coconut water without losing its nutritional value. DRDO bio-technologists carried out an extensive research on this subject in the past few years and spent nearly Rs 60 crore. The Coconut Development Board under the ministry of agriculture helped us get the technology from DRDO. We have entered a joint venture with the food processing and horticulture department to market the product, Sharma said. His company has the capacity to produce 60,000 cans of coconut water in a day.

 The state government has entered into an agreement with the agro-product company to market it, said S. Bose, the horticulture and food processing director. Horticulture department officials are hopeful that the conventional drink in its new avatar will be a hit. 

 Railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav, who earlier went desi with earthen cups and sal-leaf plates for passengers, has shown interest in the product. For travellers on train, the packaged coconut water will be available in 500-ml and 2-litre pouches.

 But officials in the horticulture and food processing department have their fingers crossed because of its earlier failure to create markets for indigenous stuff ? milk products and herbal aabir for example.

 But the pitch is stronger in this case, though. The company has already bagged an order for supplying 1.5 lakh cans of coconut water every month to several West Asian countries.

 Manoj Pant, the North 24-Parganas district magistrate, said: It will be a boon for the local youths.

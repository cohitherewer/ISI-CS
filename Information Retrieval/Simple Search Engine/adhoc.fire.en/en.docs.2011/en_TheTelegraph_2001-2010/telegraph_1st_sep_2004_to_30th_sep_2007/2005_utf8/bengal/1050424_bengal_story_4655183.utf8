 Blackout rerun at airport 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 23: Dum Dum airport plunged into darkness last evening.

 Lights at the terminal building, runway and other parts of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport went out as a CESC feeder line tripped. ?There was a blackout,? said Rajendra Paul, the airport director. ?But the lights came back in half-a-minute as we have emergency supply lines and there was no disruption in flight operations.? 

 On the runway, power returned even earlier, he added.

 However, airport officials said there was no power between 8.58 pm and 9. ?The only lights glowing were those on the taxiway,? said an official who did not want to be named. ?There was no flight movement at that time,? he added. 

 A Royal Jordanian Airlines flight was preparing for take-off but it faced no problem, sources said.

 A CESC spokesperson said one of the two 33-kv high-tension feeder lines supplying power to the airport had tripped. ?Our chief engineer was at the airport for some other reason. He contacted the control room and the snag was set right within 10 minutes,? he said.

 In January, the lights on the runway had gone out for nearly three hours, throwing flight schedules off gear.

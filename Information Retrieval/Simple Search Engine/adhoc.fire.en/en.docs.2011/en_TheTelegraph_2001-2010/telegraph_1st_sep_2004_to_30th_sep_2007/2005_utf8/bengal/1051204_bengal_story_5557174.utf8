 Business student lost

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 3: Months after a research chemist went missing from his Salt Lake residence, a business management student has mysteriously disappeared from the township.

 Nilanjan Sarkar, 23, a second-year student of the International School of Business Management in Salt Lakes Sector V, used to stay with his classmate Bumba at a rented house in Salt Lakes AD block. Sarkar, who is from Durgapur, has been staying in the house for the last two years, police said.

 Yesterday, he and Bumba returned from the institute around 3 pm. 

 Nilanjan told his friend that he was going out to make a call to his sister in Durgapur. After that, he did not return, said a police official.

 Later, a letter written by Nilanjan to Bumba was found from one of his books. 

 In the letter written in English, he said he was going away forever, the official said. Nilanjan, in the letter, had also asked Bumba to forget him.

 Bumba told police that Nilanjan had gone out wearing his best clothes. When he did not return, he got worried and on finding the letter, called Nilanjans house.

 Nilanjans father, a retired bank employee, rushed to Salt Lake and lodged a missing diary at Bidhannagar (North) police station this afternoon. Apparently, he was having some family-related problems, said an official.

 In August, Madhusudan Rao Ibathula, 23, a research chemist working with an organisation in Sector V, went missing and surfaced with a shaven head and burns on his left hand. 

 He soon returned to his hometown Narasaropet in Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh.

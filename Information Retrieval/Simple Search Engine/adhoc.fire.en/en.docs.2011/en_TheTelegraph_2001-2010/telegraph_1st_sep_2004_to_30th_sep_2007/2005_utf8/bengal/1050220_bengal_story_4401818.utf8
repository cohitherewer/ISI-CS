 Varsity room for first-class students 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 19: Presidency College today increased 10 seats in its MSc geography course and Calcutta University four to accommodate 14 students whose marks in the 2004 BSc Part-II examinations rose to 60 per cent or above after review.

 All of them were placed in the second class ? that is less than 60 per cent ? when Part-II results were declared last August.

 The decision to increase seats barely a week after the amended results were declared follows a directive from the state government. 

 The higher education department yesterday asked the two institutions to accommodate the 14 to comply with a Supreme Court directive that all students with first-class marks in BSc Part-II (Honours) examinations conducted by a university must be admitted to the university?s postgraduate course.

 CU authorities contacted the higher education department and sought its opinion on how to accommodate the students as seats in the university?s geography department as well as in Presidency college had been filled up.

 As laboratory-based teaching is required for the MSc geography course, the government had set up a committee last week to find out whether institutions that teach the subject have adequate infrastructure to increase seats to take in the 14 students. 

 The committee recommended that Presidency had the infrastructure to increase 10 seats and Calcutta University four. 

 A section of teachers, however, said the 14 will ?hardly benefit? from the decision. 

 ?The MSc geography Part-I examination will be held after two months and these students will face a lot of difficulty in covering the syllabus in such a short time,? said a senior teacher of the university?s geography department.

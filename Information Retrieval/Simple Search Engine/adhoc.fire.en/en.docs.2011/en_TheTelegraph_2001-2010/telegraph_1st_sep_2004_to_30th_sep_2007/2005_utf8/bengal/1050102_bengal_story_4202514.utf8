 Green light to court holiday

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 1: Calcutta High Court has allowed the 201 subordinate courts across the state to close for a fortnight?s summer vacation from this year in a move that will impact about 21,000 lawyers in the lower courts.

 Last year, the high court had done away with the rule that made it mandatory for lawyers to don black gowns while making submissions even during summer. The relaxation also applied to the lower courts.

 The high court?s decision comes in the wake of a series of movements launched by the bar associations of lower courts in Bankura, Burdwan, Purulia, Nadia, Murshidabad, Birbhum and Midnapore districts. These lawyers had last year boycotted the courts for a long spell, demanding a summer vacation, according to Uttam Majumdar, the secretary of the West Bengal Lawyers? Association.

 The state bar council had also submitted a memorandum to acting Chief Justice A.N. Roy supporting the demand of subordinate court lawyers.

 Two decades ago, district judges had the discretion of holding morning sessions of their courts during summer. However, that authority was, subsequently, taken away with the high court insisting on uniform court hours.

 ?There is now no other option but to allow the judges and lawyers of subordinate courts to go on 15 days? leave to get away from the scorching summer heat,? said a high court official.

 ?There has so far been some kind of discrimination between high court lawyers and those of the subordinate courts as far as vacation is concerned. While high court advocates enjoy three weeks? vacation during summer, their counterparts in the subordinate courts do not get such relief and have to brave the scorching sun,? said Majumdar.

 Members of the legal profession, including judges and magistrates, have welcomed the high court decision, but some litigants fear that the new system would result in pending cases piling up.

 ?We appreciate the lawyers? hardship during summer and are not against the vacation. But, at the same time, the authorities will have to consider that the number of pending cases is rising gradually. The high court should take some special steps to protect the interest of the common people,? said S. Chakraborty, the president of the Litigants? Forum.

 High court authorities denied the allegation that the number of pending cases in subordinate courts is rising.

 ?For the last two years, the number of pending cases in the lower courts has gone down. In 2001, about seven lakh cases were pending in the subordinate courts. Now the number has come down to 5.13 lakh,? a senior officer of the high court said.

 However, the state bar council stuck to its contention. It added that posts of judges in 146 out of 567 lower courts are still lying vacant. ?Is this not enough to indicate the piling up of cases in the lower courts?? asked Saradindu Biswas, a former chairman of the council.

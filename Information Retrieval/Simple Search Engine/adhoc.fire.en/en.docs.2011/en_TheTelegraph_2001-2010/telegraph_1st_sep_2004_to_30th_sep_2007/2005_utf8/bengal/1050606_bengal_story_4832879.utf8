 Dead wife smiling from bed

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, June 5: Learning about his wifes death, Jatin Sarkar rushed to Shaktinagar District Hospital with a truck laden with flowers and a bed for her last journey. 

 But Sarkar and his two children found Putul, 30, sitting on a bed in the female ward, smiling. She had no idea why her farmer husband was in tears and why the little ones were looking distraught. 

 A resident of Nadias Krishnagunj, Sarkar, 35, could not believe his eyes. Wiping tears with a towel, he hugged Putul. The tears rolled down again ? this time with joy.

 Putul was admitted to Dhubulia TB hospital, about 120 km from Calcutta, six months ago. She was diagnosed with abdominal problems recently and shifted to Shaktinagar hospital five days ago. However, her family was not informed about the move. Instead, the TB hospital authorities sent the message of her death to her husband through two police stations. 

 Sarkar lodged a complaint with Supriyo Sarkar, the deputy superintendent of the district hospital, 80 km from Calcutta. I am a poor farmer, earning about Rs 30 a day. I spent Rs 400 after hearing of Putuls death. Those responsible should be punished.... he said. 

 Hospitals send SOS messages to patients families through local police stations if they are absent at the time of a death. Sarkar was informed about his wifes death by the Krishnagunj police station, which was informed by Dhubulia police a day before. 

 Kindly inform Jatin Sarkar of Khatura, Krishnagunj, that Putul Sarkar expired on June 2 at Shaktinagar hospital. The body will be disposed after 24 hours, if not claimed, said the message from Dhubulia. The police cannot be blamed. The Dhubulia hospital gave us a written request on which we acted, said Nadia additional superintendent Biswarup Ghosh. 

 The Dhubulia hospital has begun a probe.

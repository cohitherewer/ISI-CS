 CM willing, mayor promises another flyover

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Where Chaos reigns: Chowringhee Square 

 Calcutta, Feb. 19: The Calcutta Municipal Corporation took off from where the state government left. 

 At the inauguration of the Park Street flyover today, mayor Subrata Mukherjee sought chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s permission to extend the Park Street flyover, which now terminates at Lindsay Street, right up to Bentinck Street. 

 Mukherjee said the Park Street flyover would have benefited more people had it been extended beyond Esplanade. ?We will, therefore, urge the chief minister to permit us to build a new flyover connecting Lindsay Street with Bentinck Street. The new flyover will ease the traffic chaos at Chowringhee crossing. We will start work once the government issues the permission,? he said.

 Bhattacharjee today expressed apprehension that the existing traffic chaos may adversely affect investment in the state and called for better traffic management. ?A day will come soon when normal life in the city will come to a standstill because of the increasing vehicular population, which has already crossed the 8-lakh mark. Besides, about 55,000 trucks enter the city every day from other states?. We have constructed a few flyovers to cope with the problem, but could not fully overcome it,? he said while inaugurating the flyover this afternoon.

 ?The only option left for us in the circumstances is to go for the rapid transit system, which will not interfere with traffic movement on the city roads,? the chief minister observed, adding that the government is now laying greater stress on improvement of traffic management.

 Bhattacharjee appeared apologetic for the inordinate delay in the flyover?s construction. ?The project should have been completed about a year ago. However, due to some unavoidable reasons it got delayed. I owe you all an apology as the chief minister for this delay,? he said.

 Construction of the Rs 54.6-lakh flyover ? funded by Japan Bank of International Cooperation ? connecting Middleton Street with Lindsay Street began on November 15, 2001, and was scheduled to be complete by November 23, 2003.

 Brushing aside the criticism levelled against him by a section of CPM leaders for praising the mayor, the chief minister said he expected Mukherjee?s cooperation in improving the city?s transport and traffic infrastructure.

 ?We floated tenders for light rail transit and received responses from a number of concerns from different parts of India and abroad. We have formed a technical committee, which is now screening the replies. We intend to undertake work on the project as early as possible and expect full cooperation from the Calcutta Municipal Corporation,? Bhattacharjee said. 

 Admitting to the rising traffic chaos, transport minister Subhas Chakraborty said engineers and experts are working to find ways to ease congestion. He said HRBC, the implementing agency of the flyover project, has a surplus of about Rs 30 crore that would be used to develop the passenger dispersal system for the proposed Chitpore railway terminal.

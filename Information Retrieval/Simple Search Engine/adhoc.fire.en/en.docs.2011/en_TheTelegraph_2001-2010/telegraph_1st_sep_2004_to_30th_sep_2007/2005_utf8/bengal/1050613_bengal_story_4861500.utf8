 Battle against odds half won

 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN

 Behrampore, June 12: Manjur Hossain of Burdwan and Sandeep Chandra of West Midnapore triumphed over poverty to make it to the medical merit list of the Joint Entrance Examination.

 But Ourangajeeb, the son of a daily agricultural labourer, could not even take the entrance test because he did not have the money to collect the application form, distributed last December. 

 There is no guarantee that he would have found a place along with the likes of Manjur and Sandeep, but everyone who knows Ourangajeeb admits that if he could score 863 in his HS exams without the help of a single private tutor, he could do more. 

 At Sitanagar village in Jalangi, about 260 km from Calcutta, Ourangajeebs father Nahiruddin earns between Rs 60 and Rs 70 a day. 

 After his selection tests, Ourangajeeb hardly left home and pored over his books under the dim light of a kerosene lantern with one aim in mind ? I must do well in HS.

 The pain of not being able to sit for JEE had bugged him all through. I could not raise Rs 500 for the form. Maybe next time?. I want to become a doctor, he said.

 For Manjur and Sandeep, schoolteachers and neighbours came to their aid. 

 Ourangajeebs teachers now feel guilty. Sunil Kumar Chakraborty, the headmaster of Sagarpara High School, said: We apologise for our lack of initiative. Its our fault. Ourangajeeb felt shy to ask for the money, but we should have gone to his house to enquire.

 The headmaster said he would ensure that he sits for JEE next year. Ourangajeeb is our brightest student.... He will definitely do well in life.

 Ourangajeeb is all praise for his teachers at Sagarpara, about 2 km from his village. After I scored 83 per cent in Madhyamik, my teachers encouraged me to pursue science and bought me the books. I could not afford tuition. I consulted a dada, an amateur tutor in Sagarpara, on English? but not regularly. He did not charge me anything, he said.

 Local traders gave him for free the shirts and trousers he now wears.

 Ourangajeeb will seek admission in Physics (honours) at Krishnanath College, Behrampore. Dwijendranath Mondal, one of his schoolteachers, said: Although he was very good in biology, physics and math were his favourites.

 Nahiruddin, 50, who did not complete his school final exams, said Ourangajeebs brother is awaiting his BA Part II results. My eldest son, Humayun Kabir, has just started earning a small sum by giving private tuitions. Ourangajeeb took a lot of pains to study. When he told me about the JEE form, I tried my level best to take a loan but my luck.... No one gave Rs 500 for my son.

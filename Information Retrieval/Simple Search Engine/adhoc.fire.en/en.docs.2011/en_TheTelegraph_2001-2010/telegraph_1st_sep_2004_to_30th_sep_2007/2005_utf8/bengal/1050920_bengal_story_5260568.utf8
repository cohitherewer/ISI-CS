 Buddha faces jihadi query

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Calcutta, Sept. 19: The CPM politburo is not the only one advising chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to be careful with his words.

 A minority lobby has asked the government to either produce evidence about the home-grown jihadi movement and ISI recruitment or ensure its ministers do not make statements that may be used to tarnish the image of the community.

 In various forums you often talk about a section of Muslims from Bengal participating in jihadi activities in Bangladesh, the Muslim Council of Bengal has written to the chief minister.

 But so far neither you nor any of your ministers has produced an iota of evidence in support of your contention. Nor has your government taken into confidence Bengals Muslim leadership which is as much concerned about Bengals welfare as the rest of you, the council says.

 It is insulting because Muslims, though trapped in poverty and illiteracy, have not joined Naxalites, KLO, Maoists or any such movement, Ahmed Hasan Imran, the general secretary of the council, has written in the three-page letter. 

 Pressure groups led by the council have also asked the government to provide jobs to people who have lost their land in the governments acquisition programme in South 24-Parganas areas like Mograhat, Baruipur and Sonarpur.

 The council has demanded the government announce immediate plans for those who have lost farmland.

 Armed with their demands, over 100,000 people belonging to over 22 different organisations of the city, supported by the council, will assemble at Rani Rashmoni Road on Wednesday to condemn recent comments made by the chief minister and decide on action. 

 When the chief minister assumed charge as minister of minority affairs as additional responsibility, he told us that he was always there to help us. He has not yet replied to our concerns vented through our letter to him. Now we have decided to despatch another letter to him, said Quari Fazlur Rehman, the president of the council.

 Council members are particularly peeved at Bhattacharjees repeated suggestions that Bengal was becoming an extension of the jihadi movement in Bangladesh.

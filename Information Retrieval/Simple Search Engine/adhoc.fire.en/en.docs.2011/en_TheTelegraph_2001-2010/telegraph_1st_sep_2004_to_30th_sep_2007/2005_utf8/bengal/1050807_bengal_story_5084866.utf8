 Death news delay rocks SSKM

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 6: Staff at SSKM Hospitals burns ward allegedly failed to inform a patients family about his death today, triggering a two-hour demonstration.

 Subhas Malakar, 30, of Ghatal in West Midnapore, lay dead on his bed for four hours ? from 5.30 am till his relatives arrived to feed him at 9.30 ? the agitators said. Malakar had been admitted to the hospital on July 25.

 The family, supported by some local people, kicked up a ruckus, stopping work for two hours as scared nurses and other staff fled the ward.

 The agitators moved into the emergency ward after some time and then made for the hospital superintendents chamber. 

 An oral complaint was lodged with superintendent Santanu Tripathy. 

 I have advised the family to give me a formal complaint on Monday. We will initiate an inquiry, Tripathy said.

 He, however, said that the patient had not died at 5.30 but only around 9.10.

 The news of a patients death goes to the ward-master first and then to the emergency, which informs the family. It takes a little time that we didnt get today before the commotion started, Tripathy said.

 Had the patients family informed us straight away without kicking up a row, the post-mortem could have been done today, a hospital official said. 

 Now, we must wait till Monday, because we do not conduct post-mortems on Sundays unless it is a special case.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, July 15: Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty today stuck to his earlier statement that he had been organising elections in Salt lake by mobilising party supporters from outside since 1952. 

 I have never denied what I said on any issue. I told you that we have been organising elections by mobilising our leaders and supporters from outside since 1952 and I still stick to that, Chakraborty said in the Assembly lobby. He also criticised chief minister without naming him. Yesterday, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had expressed his disapproval of the ministers earlier statement also without naming him. Bhattacharjee had told the Assembly that those who said elections are held by bringing in supporters from outside gave vent to personal feelings... 

 Chakraborty said: A senior leader like Jyoti Basu had declared the issue a closed chapter. I dont know why it was raised in the Assembly. 

 Burdwan: Assam-bound Kamrup Express escaped a disaster on Friday as the driver stopped it near Kalna after spotting a fire on the wheels. The blaze under S3 compartment was seen around 7.30 pm. The passengers were accommodated in other coaches when the train left Kalna, 180 km from Calcutta, around 11.

 Suri: A gang broke into Mayurakshi Gramin Bank at Kolitha at Nalhati, Birbhum, on Thursday night and decamped with Rs 1.26 lakh. Residents noticed on Friday morning that the door of the bank, 300 km from Calcutta, was broken. Police said the vault where the money was kept was also broken.

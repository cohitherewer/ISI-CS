 Adultery arrest 

 Krishnagar, April 12: A retired bank employee was caught living with an 18-year-old girl he had initially decided to marry off to his son.

 Debdas Das, 62, and Banasree Tarafdar were picked up last night from his ancestral house at Shantipur in Nadia, 70 km from Calcutta. Das?s wife Anjana had lodged a complaint against him with police alleging adultery and torture. 

 Banasree, a Bangladesh citizen, was held for not possessing a valid passport. 

 Anjana lives at Rahara in North 24-Parganas with her son and daughter, both in their early twenties. Nadia police chief Benoy Chakraborty said Debdas had been living with the girl for the past six months. His wife came to know about it a fortnight ago. ?She inquired on her own and found that her husband was living with the girl supposed to get married to her mentally-challenged son,? said Chakraborty. 

 A Shantipur police station officer said Debdas, who had retired from a nationalised bank?s Sodepur branch, told Banasree?s father Atin Tarafdar, his old friend and a resident of Khulna, Bangladesh, that he wanted to get his son married to his daughter. ?Atin approved of the match and came down with Banasree to a relative at Swarupnagar near Bongaon.?

 Atin left saying he would come back a few months later to finalise the date of marriage. Debdas got his permission to keep Banasree back saying Anjana would take care of her, but instead of taking her to Rahara, he took her to Shantipur.

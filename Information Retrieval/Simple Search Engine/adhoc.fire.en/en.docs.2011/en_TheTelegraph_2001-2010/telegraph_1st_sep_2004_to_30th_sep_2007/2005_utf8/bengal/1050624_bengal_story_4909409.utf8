 Mamata picks her civic marshals

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, June 23: The Trinamul Congress today chose Javed Ahmed Khan as the leader of Opposition in the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.

 At a meeting chaired by party chief Mamata Banerjee at Trinamul Bhavan in Topsia tonight, Anup Chatterjee was selected the chief whip and deputy leader. 

 Ajit Panja will head the partys newly-formed municipal affairs committee. Councillors Smita Bakshi and Ratna Sur were made secretaries of the municipal party while councillor Atin Ghosh bagged the post of chairman of CMCs public accounts committee.

 Mamata also announced that she would sit on an indefinite dharna at Esplanade from tomorrow morning to protest against the hike in prices of petrol and diesel. 

 There is more action on her plate tomorrow. The Trinamul leader will lead a party delegation to governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi in the afternoon to lodge a complaint against the alleged rigging by the ruling CPM in the civic polls in Calcutta and Salt Lake.

 Earlier in the evening, the Trinamul had gone into a huddle to pick its civic body force.

 Party insiders said that among the councillors, Ajit Panja was the top contender for the Opposition leaders post. However, the former Union minister, who is also a busy barrister, was not too willing. I dont have the time to be regularly present at the CMC or the civic house meetings, he apparently told his aides.

 Khan, who got the post, was the former mayors council member in charge of health and was declared leader of the Trinamul municipal party immediately after Subrata Mukherjee left. 

 Tonights meeting also did a post-mortem on the poll results. We discussed how the CPM rigged the elections and the need to find out the Trojan horses, a Trinamul councillor said.

 Mamata, who had yesterday vowed to fight the Left Front tooth and nail, sought her councillors opinions on how the Opposition should function. We discussed whether we should launch an offensive from the word go or play the role of a constructive Opposition. But one thing we can tell you is that we will not allow the CPM much peace, said a Trinamul councillor.

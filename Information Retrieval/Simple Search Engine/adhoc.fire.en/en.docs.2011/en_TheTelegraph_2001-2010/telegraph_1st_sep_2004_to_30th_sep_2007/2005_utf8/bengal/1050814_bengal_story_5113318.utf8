 Tanker burst at roadside draws flak

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 13: At least 12 people were injured when an oil tanker parked on James Long Sarani in Behala burst into flames around 11 this morning.

 The tanker, containing residual fuel, was being repaired at the roadside near Pora Ashathatolla. Police sources said the fire was caused by a spark when the tanker was being welded.

 The tanker soon exploded, triggering panic. Two empty tankers parked nearby also caught fire and were damaged.

 At least 12 people, including the welders and passers-by, suffered critical burn injuries and have been admitted to the Vidyasagar hospital and the Balananda Brahmachari hospital.

 The windowpanes of three houses nearby were shattered. 

 Residents of the area demonstrated on James Long Sarani, disrupting traffic for over one hour. They alleged that the oil tankers were repaired without essential precautions and were illegally parked along the road.

 This was bound to happen. Recently, small repair shops have mushroomed in the area. The tankers are parked at the roadside illegally everyday and repaired without any precaution being taken, said an elderly man.

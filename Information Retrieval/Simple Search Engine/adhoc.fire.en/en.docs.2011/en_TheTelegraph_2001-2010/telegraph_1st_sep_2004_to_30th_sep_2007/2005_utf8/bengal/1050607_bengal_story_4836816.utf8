 Double trouble spooks rail contractors

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 6: Lack of law and order in railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadavs home state and its cousin Jharkhand is apparently scaring railway contractors away.

 Projects to the tune of Rs 700 crore are in the pipeline but the tenders floated are not receiving any response, a railway official today said at an interaction with the contractors to make out the reasons for their lack of interest. 

 We have not received offers in many tenders. In some, we have got single bidders and they had to be cancelled as a result. This indicates a lack of interest on the part of contractors in the region, said Rajeev Bhargava, the chief administrative officer (construction) of East Central Railway.

 The contractors alleged that while in Bihar it was the mafia, in Jharkhand the CPI (Maoist) guerrillas were a threat. A Calcutta-based contractor, working in the region for the past 30 years, said the law and order situation has been a serious problem. He refused to be identified. 

 Dacoity, abduction and extortion were said to be some of the common fears among the contractors who came today. 

 Bhargava, however, denied that the law and order situation was the reason for them turning their backs. They dont know the quantum of work and the opportunities lying ahead. Once they become aware of the work in the pipeline, they will come, he said. 

 The railway has to complete earthwork and bridges along 1,745 km and lay new tracks in the next few years.

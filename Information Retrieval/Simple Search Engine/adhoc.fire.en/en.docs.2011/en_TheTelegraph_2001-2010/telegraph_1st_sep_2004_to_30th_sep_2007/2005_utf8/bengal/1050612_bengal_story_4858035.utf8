 Savoury baron brother under fire

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, June 11: After Prabhu Shankar Agarwal, the owner of Haldirams chain of confectioneries, it is the turn of his brother Mahesh to face the heat. 

 Officers from the fire services department and the Shakespeare Sarani police station swooped on Maheshs sprawling Haldirams establishment at the intersection of Jawaharlal Nehru Road and AJC Bose Road and sealed its first, mezzanine and second floors for violation of fire-safety norms.

 The floors house the kitchens of the outlet. 

 Maheshs brother Prabhu Shankar has been arrested for involvement in the attempt on the life of Satyanarayan Thakur, a tea-stall owner in Burrabazar. Thakurs tea stall was on the ground floor of a property that Prabhu Shankar was developing on Jagmohan Mullick Lane.

 According to fire service officials, the kitchens in Maheshs outlet had around 45 gas and diesel ovens running at a time and the owner did not have the necessary licence. In case of a fire, they said, the extent of disaster would have been unimaginable. 

 The kitchens have been running in a terrible state. Gas and diesel ovens were hoarded in rows in temporary structures without adhering to the basic fire-safety rules. The kitchens have been sealed and we have booked the owner under sections that are non-bailable, said fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee.

 The move comes four days after the polices detective department handcuffed the 45-year-old Prabhu Shankar at Delhis Palam airport. 

 Mahesh, the police said, cannot be traced. 

 This is a cognisable offence and Mahesh faces arrest. His mobile phone is switched off and there is no way one can track him. Even those who run the show on his behalf are not available, said a senior officer of Shakespeare Sarani police station. 

 V.V. Sobhanadri, the chief manager of Andhra Bank, situated on the top floor of the outlet, had met the fire services minister to lodge a complaint yesterday. 

 Chatterjee held a brief meeting with the top brass of his department soon after and a team led by Gopal Bhattacharya, the deputy director of fire services, was sent for an on-the-spot inquiry.

 With ghee tins placed next to gas and diesel ovens and no proper safety measures, it was a fire-trap. We couldnt believe it. Soon after the inquiry, an FIR was lodged and the kitchens sealed, said Bhattacharya.

 Its been three months now that we have been suffering owing to continuous flow of water from the terrace to the top floor. The customers would have to stand in a pool of water. Our main server had to be shifted and even certain files had to be removed to cope with this problem of seeping water from the top. We tried to tell Mahesh Agarwal, but he would just not listen. Finally, we had to fall back on the minister, said Sobhanadri.

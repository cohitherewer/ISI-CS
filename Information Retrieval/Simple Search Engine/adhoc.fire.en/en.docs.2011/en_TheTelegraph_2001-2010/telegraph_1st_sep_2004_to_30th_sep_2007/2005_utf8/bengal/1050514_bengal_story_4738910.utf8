 Hotel union demands

 Calcutta, May 13: Citu and Intuc leaders of Great Eastern Hotel met tourism secretary T.K. Burman separately today.

 Their demands included regularising all 44 employees who are now on contract and reappointment for employees below 45. However, the government iterated that the contract employees would stand to lose in the early retirement package if they are regularised. 

 They will get more in the present status than if they are regularised. We have to make the unions understand that, a senior Writers official said.

 BRIEFS

 Kharagpur, Nov. 25: Howrah-bound Sambalpur Express hit a stationary Kharagpur local at Panskura station in East Midnapore today injuring 25 people, two of them seriously. 

 Under the impact of the collision ? around 8.30 am ? two coaches of the local train jumped rails and climbed tracks on the Up line, 75 km from Calcutta. Many trains on the Howrah-Kharagpur section had to be short-terminated or rescheduled. A railway spokesman said the driver of the express, U.N. Singh, and his assistant have been suspended. They apparently overshot a signal. Singh and a passenger, Sheikh Salimuddin, are in hospital.

 Krishnagar: Manoranjan Sarkar, 44, committed suicide apparently after being humiliated by his wife of 20 years for talking to a neighbours wife. Police said Sarkar, a trader at Hanskhali, 70 km from Calcutta, had met her at a wedding.

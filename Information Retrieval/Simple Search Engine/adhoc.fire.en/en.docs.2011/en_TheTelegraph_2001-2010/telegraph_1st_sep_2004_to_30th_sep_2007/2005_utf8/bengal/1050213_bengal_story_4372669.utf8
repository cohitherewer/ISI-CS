 Robber raid in Durgapur

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Feb. 12: A gang of 20 robbers swooped on Durgapur Station Bazar a little after midnight and fled with cash and gold jewellery worth Rs 1 lakh from two houses. 

 Armed with revolvers and daggers, the robbers also hurled bombs, injuring three persons ? two of them from the families they looted.

 Around 2 am today, the gang broke into the house of businessman Jatin Ram and held his son Bipin at gunpoint, forcing Jatin to hand over the almirah keys. 

 ?They took ornaments, garments and Rs 10,000 in cash. Before leaving, they also disconnected the telephone and ransacked my house,? said Jatin, lying in a nursing home with splinter injuries.

 The robbers then barged into Buddha Bind?s house but had to flee soon after as the family woke up. His neighbours chased the gang but gave up when the robbers began hurling bombs.

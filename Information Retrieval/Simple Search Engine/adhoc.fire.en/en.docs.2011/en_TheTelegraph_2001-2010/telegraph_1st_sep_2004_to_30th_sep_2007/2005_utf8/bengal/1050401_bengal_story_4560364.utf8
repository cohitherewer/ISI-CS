 Great Eastern put on hold

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 31: The state government is unlikely to take any key decision on the planned privatisation of the ailing Great Eastern Hotel till April 12, as grants from the UK?s department for international development for funding an early retirement scheme at the hotel has already been passed on to the state.

 Officials today said the government would like to wait till the week-long CPM congress in Delhi ends on April 12. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, industry minister Nirupam Sen and tourism minister Dinesh Dakua ? key persons dealing with the privatisation ? are to attend the party congress.

 ?A high-level meeting is essential to take a final decision. However, I am off to the districts today and then I will be in Delhi. I will be back in Calcutta only after April 12,? Dakua said at Writers? Buildings, indicating that no major decision would be taken on the hotel in the next few days.

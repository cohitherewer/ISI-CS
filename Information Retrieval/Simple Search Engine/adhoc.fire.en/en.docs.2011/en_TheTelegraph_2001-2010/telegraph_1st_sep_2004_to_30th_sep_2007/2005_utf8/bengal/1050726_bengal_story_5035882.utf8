 Conciliation bill scrapped

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 25: The government today allowed the controversial West Bengal Block Level Pre-litigation Conciliation Board Bill, 2004, better known as the Shalishi Bill, to die a natural death.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee announced after an all-party meeting that his government will not introduce it in the current session of the Assembly, likely to be over on August 4.

 It is learnt that the CPM itself is divided over the tabling of the bill before next years Assembly polls. Sources said reservations among CPM leaders in the districts regarding the bill prompted the government to hold it back. 

 The Shalishi Bill would have allowed resolution of civil disputes at the block level outside court. The Opposition had alleged that the CPM would pack the pre-litigation boards with its men and that they would subvert the judiciary.

 Trinamul Congress and Congress legislators welcomed the governments decision.

 Leader of Opposition Pankaj Banerjee said the bill was not required as the Legal Services Authority Act, 1987, had enough provisions to settle disputes in rural areas amicably.

 Bhattacharjee told reporters that his government did not want to promulgate the act forcibly. It is not my policy, he said.

 Asked whether he succumbed to pressure from the Opposition, the chief minister said: Not at all. I still support the bill but I want to get it passed on the basis of consensus. It is a very sensitive bill and differences had cropped up between the government and the Opposition. That is why we are not introducing the bill in this session. This is the second time the government has gone back on its decision to table the bill.

 Student held for rape

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Barasat, May 28: A second-year college student, 

Prasenjit Brahma, has been arrested for allegedly raping a nine-year-old girl 

last night.

 The incident took place at Rajbalavpara in Maslanadapur, about 70 km from Calcutta, when the girl came to 21-year-old Prasenjits house to watch television, police said.

 The boy, in the course of interrogation, confessed having raped the girl. The victim, now undergoing treatment at the Habra state general hospital, will be sent for a medical examination once she is released, said Praveen Kumar, superintendent of police, North 24 Parganas.

 As the news spread, over 500 residents of the area raided Prasenjits house and dragged him out. 

 They tied him to a tree and beat him up. However, the police arrived on the scene and rescued a bleeding Prasenjit.

 According to the police, the girl, who stays in the neighbourhood, came to Prasenjits house around 8 last night to watch a TV serial as there was a power cut in the area and Prasenjits family had an inverter in their house.

 Around 9.15, she returned home crying but refused to tell what had happened. When members of her family spotted blood stains on her clothes, they got suspicious and lodged a complaint with the local police. Several residents also joined them to protest against the crime, Kumar said.

 The victims father said Prasenjit used to call his daughter to his house and played with her.

 We never thought that Prasenjit could commit such a heinous crime. That is why, when my daughter came back home last night crying, we were shocked. Later, having heard everything from her, I lodged a complaint with the police, he added. 

 The girl, who has developed an acute pain in her lower abdomen, was shifted to the Habra state general hospital.

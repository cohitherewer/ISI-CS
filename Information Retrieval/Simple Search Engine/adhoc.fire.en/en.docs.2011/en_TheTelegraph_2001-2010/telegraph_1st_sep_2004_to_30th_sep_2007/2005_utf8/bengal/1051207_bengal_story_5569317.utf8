 Burdwan, Dec. 6: Local goons have threatened to murder a US-based Indian who runs a school in Burdwan if he fails to cough up Rs 1.5 lakh.

 Pranab Goswami, who opened Holy Child School in the district town six years ago, has been the goons target since October, when he came down from Philadelphia to see the institution and his 80-year-old mother. 

 On November 28, the extortionists accosted Goswami at the school gate. He lodged a police complaint, but no one was arrested.

 I had faced pressure from local youths regarding jobs when I started the school in 1999. This time, they demanded Rs 1.5 lakh from my mother. From late October, they began to threaten me with kidnap and murder if I failed to pay up, said Goswami, 58, who visits his hometown twice every year.

 Goswami said he had plans to set up a food-processing unit in the district with an investment of about Rs 10 crore. But after what I went through, I am having second thoughts, he said.

 Gargi Banerjee, whose daughter Pinky is a Class IV student at the school, was witness to the assault on Goswami. She said: He was standing in front of the gate when a group of local youths went up to him and demanded money. One of them took him by the collar and hit him on the face?. He was bleeding from the lips. The youths went away shouting slogans that he was a bourgeois and an imperialist.

 The owner of the local stationery, Mantu Karmakar, narrated the same sequence of events.

 Police had gone there to investigate the incident. Additional superintendent Rabin Mukherjee said: There was no untoward incident after that. We have recorded Goswamis complaint as a general diary, but we have not started a case.

 The attitude of the police has surprised lawyers. We dont understand why the complaint was treated only as a general diary as the charges are non-bailable. The police should have arrested those accused and produced them in court, said Swapan Banerjee, a criminal lawyer in the district court.

 On Saturday, Goswami wrote to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and industries minister Nirupam Sen. 

 Burdwan town is my birthplace. I had set up the school here for its development. I had also bought 5 bighas for the food-processing unit. But some local hooligans are standing in the way and the police are refusing to respond to my complaints, said Goswami, who left for Germany in 1961 on a scholarship at Kiel University and is now a senior engineer at a nuclear power plant in Philadelphia.

 The district CPM leadership condemned his harassment. 

 The youths who threatened Goswami have nothing to do with our party. The police should immediately arrest the culprits, said Amal Haldar, the secretary of the partys district unit.

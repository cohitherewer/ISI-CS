 Mishap spills hospital skeleton

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Suri, Aug. 3: A road crash in Birbhum yesterday has taken the lid off the sorry state of affairs at the Suri Sadar Hospital.

 When 30 injured persons were taken to the state-run hospital ? half an hour after a speeding truck hit a private bus in the Mohammad Bazar area around noon ? there was only one doctor in sight.

 The hospital, which employs 40 doctors, also could not provide anyone to conduct the post-mortem on the seven people killed.

 When the district chief medical officer of health (CMOH), Shyamapada Basak, and district magistrate Khalil Ahmed went to the hospital in the afternoon after hearing about the mishap, a picture of chaos greeted them. 

 As Dr Purushottam Som struggled to treat so many people, the patients families and friends rushed to him with a chorus of complaints. 

 Four doctors on duty were allegedly busy either with private practice or in nursing homes.

 Ahmed located the doctors and summoned them to the hospital. When I visited the hospital, four doctors who were supposed to be on duty were not there. I contacted them and brought them over to the hospital. I also received some complaints at the hospital and sought a report from the CMOH, the DM said.

 He contacted an orthopaedic surgeon from the Bolpur sub-divisional hospital and had him brought over to Suri as well.

 Ahmed has sought details about the truant doctors, whether X-ray was done on the injured and if there was any shortage of medicine, blood or oxygen. 

 Mohammad Alam, who fractured his legs, said he had to wait till 9 pm to get his X-rays taken and legs plastered.

 For Mohammad Sirazul Haque, who had broken both his legs, the ordeal continued till the DM arrived. I did not see any doctors. They arrived after the district magistrate took steps, said Haques cousin Aman Mondal.

 The DM has asked Basak to prepare a list of doctors working in the hospital for 10 years or more. I will submit the list to the DM soon. We have received some complaints and we are probing the matter, the CMOH said.

 The director of health services, Prabhakar Chatterjee, expressed concern and said he, too, would immediately ask the CMOH to submit a detailed report. Those found guilty will not be spare.

 Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra will visit Suri tomorrow and the district administration is expected to give him a report.

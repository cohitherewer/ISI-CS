 Students escape bus blaze

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Feb. 26: Passengers had to scamper for life this afternoon when a CSTC bus trundling down Bijon Setu caught fire off Bakultala.

 Fortuitously, no one was injured but many school students travelling on route SD-4 lost their books in the blaze. The children had to leave their bags in a rush to get off the bus going to Nicco Park from Parnasree in Behala. 

 Local residents and a fire tender from the Gariahat station were enough to douse the flames. The rescue operation lasted over 45 minutes, following which the bus was taken to the CSTC garage and traffic restored. 

 No one has been arrested for the accident that CSTC insiders said occurred because of slack maintenance. 

 S.K. Bagchi, the inspector-in-charge of Kasba police station, said: ?The passengers had warned the driver that something was burning, but it went unheeded. Soon the burning smell was all over and sparks could be seen flashing out of the chasis. In no time, the flames leapt up.? 

 Panic spread fast as the driver jumped out and many others tried to do the same. Some of the passengers called local police officers to bail them out while others started screaming.

 Faith runs dry in Beliaghata

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 11: For close to six months, residents of Beliaghata have been nursing a dream ? an unending supply of drinking water. 

 As they waited for water pipelines to be laid, they patiently put up with dug-up roads, piles of debris lying around their homes and, of course, the perennial shortage of water. 

 The residents kept their hopes alive, pinning faith on the promises made by their councillor, Trinamuls Pabitra Biswas of ward 33.

 Finally, the pipelines were laid and the roads patched up, but the taps at home still ran dry. An inquiry revealed faults in the laying of the pipes. 

 We have been cheated, said resident Mrinal Roy. We have been paying taxes, but the civic authorities have failed to provide us with safe drinking water. What can we expect from people who cannot provide us with this basic necessity?

 Residents of large parts of the area have for years had to depend on water from deep tube-wells, which, many have reported, contain traces of arsenic and iron. 

 For the last six months, the Calcutta Municipal Corporation has been providing potable water from the Talla pumping station, but this is limited and is of marginal use to people.

 Fortunately, the infectious diseases hospital is next door, said Bikash Pal of Suren Tagore Road, tongue firmly in cheek.

 The councillor, however, goes on undeterred ? give us another term and we will get this problem sorted out. But there are no takers.

 Adjoining Maniktala (most of which is under ward 27) is luckier. But though residents here dont have to grapple with water shortage, they have to live with a stinking problem. 

 The massive garbage vat behind the Maniktala market spills over to the main road and residents say the stench is unbearable, especially in summer.

 No one comes to collect garbage here regularly, said Amar Goswami, who stays in Sukia Street. They simply leave us to bear with it.

 On the sunnier side, people here say, the dereservation of tram tracks along APC Road ? from Rajabazar to Sahitya Parishad Street ? has come as a boon and eased the problem of congestion.

 But what most people do not realise is that the credit for this goes solely to the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioner, and the CMC has nothing to do with it.

 Step into Phoolbagan and there is some relief from the litany of complaints about roads, garbage and water.

 CIT Road, one of the main thoroughfares, has been widened, a childrens park and a swimming pool have been set up and a traffic island has been trimmed to give more space to cars.

 Paresh Pal, Trinamul councillor of ward 31, gives all credit to the CMC. No other agency has contributed to this work, adds Pal, who has held on to the post for the last two decades.

 The only sore point, residents say, is that the slums are bursting at the seams.

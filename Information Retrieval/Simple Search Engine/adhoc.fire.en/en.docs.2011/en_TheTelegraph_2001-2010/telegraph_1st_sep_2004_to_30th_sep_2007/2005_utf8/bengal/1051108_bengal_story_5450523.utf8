 BRIEFS

 Behrampore, Nov. 7: A fresh arrest warrant was issued against Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury today.

 This time, he is wanted in connection with a clash between Congress and CPM supporters over elections to the local Bhagirathi Milk Co-operative Society in January. A warrant has already been issued against the Behrampore MP and his wife Arpita in connection with twin murders in a local hotel on July 23. Police said a case was registered against Chowdhury and five others for their involvement in the clash. The rest were granted bail but not him because he did not turned up.

 Ranchi: Indrajit Chowdhury, 30, from Durgapur, died here when he apparently slipped and fell in the Dasham Falls on Saturday. An employee of a private firm, he came to Ranchi on a five-day tour with his wife and other relatives on Saturday itself. Police said they spent the day at the falls, 35 km from Ranchi. Before leaving around 5 pm, Chowdhury and a relative went to the falls for a wash. As it was late afternoon, most other people had left the place, said a local police officer. Six deaths have been reported at the falls in the past 10 months.

 Behrampore: Tarun Das, a middle-aged man, was arrested on Monday for allegedly killing his five-month-old daughter at Sagardighi, Murshidabad, 200 km from Calcutta. Mamoni, his wife, said Das had wanted a son.

 Calcutta: Shyam Mullick, the secretary of a Kali Puja committee, was arrested on Monday for bursting crackers at SSKM Hospital. Residents had lodged complaints against the organisers.

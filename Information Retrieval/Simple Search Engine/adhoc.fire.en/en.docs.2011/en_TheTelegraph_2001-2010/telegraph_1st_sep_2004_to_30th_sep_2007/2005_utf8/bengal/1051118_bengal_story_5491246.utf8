 Student suicide

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur Nov. 17: A 21-year-old student of the National Institute of Technology was found hanging from a ceiling fan at his home last night.

 Abhishek Bhuia, a third-year electronics and telecommunication student, was suffering from depression, police said. He used to stay alone at the Mining and Allied Machinery Corporation (MAMC) colony, 200 km from Calcutta.

 A police officer said Abhisheks mother Bina, too, had committed suicide in the same manner when he was three. His father Nilkanta, a former MAMC employee, died of heart attack last year. He would often tell his friends that he wanted to follow his mother.

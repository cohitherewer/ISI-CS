 Rapist trapped in marriage lie 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, May 29: From frying pan to fire.

 A false witness helped Alam Sheikh prove in court that he had married Firdausi and then divorced her. He escaped punishment for rape that the 24-year-old had accused him of, but as an anticlimax to his drama, Alam ended up with an order to pay his former wife a monthly maintenance of Rs 10,000.

 Thirty-year-old Alam, a contractor in the irrigation department and resident of Lakshminagar in Dhulian, had an affair with Firdausi, a bidi worker, in 1996. But when he refused to marry her, Firdausi filed a case at the additional district sessions judges court in Jangipur in Murshidabad district, 250 km from Calcutta, in December 1997.

 During the hearing of the case, Alams lawyer Moloy Kumar Das said: The statement made by the petitioner is baseless and false. My client kept his promise and married her in September 1997. But their marriage did not survive and after only two months, my client got a talaq in accordance with Islamic law.

 Das produced a maulvi, who said he was witness to both the marriage and the talaq and Alam was acquitted.

 Gupta moved the Jangipur subdivisional judicial magistrates court and demanded maintenance for his client. Alams lawyer denied his client had married Firdausi. When Gupta submitted the documents of the case heard in the sessions court, the magistrate directed Alam to pay Firdausi Rs 10,000 every month.

 Asok glare on auto spurt

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Dec. 17: The rising number of autorickshaws dominated the discussion on the citys traffic situation at a citizens convention organised by the Siliguri Municipal Corporation today.

 Urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya did not mince words.

 There are more than 2,500 autorickshaws plying in the town, and all of them are routed through the Court More. I fail to understand how all of them are given permits by the department, he said.

 Later in the discussion, the Siliguri additional superintendent of police, Tripurari, complained of an acute staff crunch in his department. There are no policemen trained in traffic management, he said. There are only 146 police personnel looking after 47 traffic beats. 

 Bhattacharya said Siliguri should have a separate police commission a multi-storeyed parking lot.

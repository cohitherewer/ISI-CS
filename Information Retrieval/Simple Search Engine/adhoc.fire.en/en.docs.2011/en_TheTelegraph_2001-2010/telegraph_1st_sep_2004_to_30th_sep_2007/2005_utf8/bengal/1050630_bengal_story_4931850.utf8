 Cell to check poaching

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 29: The state government today decided to set up a Wildlife Crime Cell to check poaching. 

 The cell will comprise officers from the polices wildlife wing, the enforcement branch and intelligence agencies. It will keep in touch with neighbouring countries like Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh and collect relevant information. We will also open a forensic laboratory to deal with wildlife crimes, forest minister Jogesh Burman said after a meeting of the state wildlife board.

 The meeting was chaired by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 The laboratory will be housed in a section of the state Forensic Science Laboratory at Belgachhia, where the bodies and viscera of carcasses will be examined. 

 The forest department has been allotted 100 acres in Jharkhali in the Sunderbans. We will build a rescue-cum-rehabilitation centre for tigers. We have already submitted a Rs 60-lakh proposal to the Centre for this, said the minister.

 Plans are also afoot for setting up an elephant rescue centre at Mayurjharna in West Midnapore.

 The monkey menace plaguing the state came up for discussion as well.

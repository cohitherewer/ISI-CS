 Lohamelia (West Midnapore), Feb. 26: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today held out an olive branch to Naxalites and sought their cooperation to accelerate development in rural areas.

 ?I would call upon all of you to return home. Our government will take care of your families. Why do you have to stay underground in Jharkhand and its adjoining areas? Even at Naxalbari there are no Naxalites now. Why do you have to move around with arms? We?ll all work together to ensure Bengal?s development,? assured Bhattacharjee.

 The chief minister was addressing a public rally at Pirakata under Salboni police station after handing over the keys of houses to five Lodha families.

 Rebels had recently put up posters urging people not to attend today?s rally. ?I presume some Naxalites are present at this gathering. I appeal to all of you to come back to the mainstream. I will ask the co-operative societies to look into the uneven distribution of profit made from selling of kendu leaves and sal trunks,? he said.

 Bhattacharjee conceded certain lapses on his government?s part in bringing about development in the area.

 ?We have identified around 14,000 villages in the region that are still to reap the benefits of development. Under the Rashtriya Samabikah Yojana, we have decided to release Rs 15 crore annually for the next three years for development projects. I would ask the district magistrate to see to it that the amount is utilised for the benefit of villagers in and around Jhargram.?

 Bhattacharjee?s appeal to the rebels came a day after he claimed that Naxalites and Kamtapur Liberation Organisation activists were using Calcutta to collect money and urged state officials to immediately put an end to it. The chief minister had even said Naxalites from Andhra Pradesh were finding their way to Midnapore.

 ?I had made a similar appeal to the KLO and many of them have already surrendered their arms,? he said.

 The chief minister also called upon panchayat leaders to rise above party politics so that no one is deprived of the benefits of development.

 Fetters off freedom hero

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 30: Usha Chowdhury, a member of the historic Tamralipta government ? set up by freedom fighters of undivided Midnapore on December 17, 1942 ? is now living off others.

 At 85, and no one to look after her, she lives as a dependant of a family in Mahishadal, East Midnapore. The governments ? state and cent- ral ? have refused help to her because she is not actually Usha Chowdhury. 

 Giribala Dey of Noakhali, now in Bangladesh, came to her brother in 1939 and got involved in the freedom movement. She assumed the new name to evade police and it remained as such. 

 The police files only refer to Giribala. So, Giribala, now Usha, cannot claim the help. 

 A voluntary organisation, however, has come forward with help for Usha and Kumudini Dakua, her comrade in the Bhagini Sena. 

 The confusion has been created by the change of name. But we are providing financial support to both Giribala and Dakua, said Shariar Kabir, the South Asian representative of the International Institute of Social History, which felicitated both the freedom fighters today.

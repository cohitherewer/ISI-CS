 CESC heat on apathetic cops

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 24: A director of the CESC has decided to move court against police after five engineers of the power utility were beaten up in Metiabruz today as the men in uniform looked on.

 Shantanu Chatterjee, executive director, corporate development, said: I strongly object to the role police have played. As a citizen of the state, I will move court against the police and file a public interest litigation.

 CESC officials said the engineers were beaten up at a place opposite the Metiabruz police station when they went there to disconnect illegal connections.

 More than 50 people, armed with sticks and iron rods, surrounded the engineers and beat them for nearly half an hour. Two engineers were rushed to hospital with fractures in the head, hand and leg.

 Chatterjee said: The officer-in-charge came after the assault when our officers were groaning in pain.

 The executive director said he had received several phone calls and letters from residents of the locality complaining about more than 70 illegal connections in the vicinity of Metiabruz police station.

 We decided to send a team for inspection and to disconnect the illegal tapping. Before sending the team, we contacted the police station seeking assistance. But they refused, saying they did not have adequate manpower, he said.

 We found that a number of shops, small factories and houses had taken connections from the nearest posts illegally, said Chatterjee.

 The policemen at the police station were watching while our officers were being beaten up but they stood there and watched, he said. After we lodged a complaint, an officer merely said he would look into the matter and went off.

 South 24-Parganas superintendent of police S.N. Gupta said he would probe the allegations. If anyone is found guilty, action will be taken against him.

 Schools in green spot

 RICHA BANSAL

 Calcutta, July 2: Igloos are made up of ice blocks. Eskimos live in them, says an ICSE textbook for Class VI. The book may be brand new, but the information is outdated.

 Even a child who watches the Discovery channel will tell you that now Eskimos live in proper houses and lead a modern life, says Angela Ghose, the headmistress of St James School. 

 The Indian Council for Secondary Education has introduced a compulsory subject ? environmental education ? for which board examinations for Classes X and XII will be held from 2007 onwards.

 School principals, already grappling with untrained teachers for the new subject, find themselves in a spot with books that clearly need upgradation. 

 Its a rushed job, said C.R. Gasper, the principal of St. Augustines Day School. Publishers have borrowed things from here and there. They had to introduce the books at a short notice since classes for IX to XII had already begun and first-term examinations were round the corner. There is not one book, even at the primary level, to which I will give pass marks.

 Moreover, added J.K. Sen, the principal of Julien day School, Ganganagar, there is a mad rush among publishers to be first to capture the market. So there is no quality check.

 According to ICSE chairman Neil Brien, people read a lot but rarely take action. Environmental education has been introduced with the purpose of generating that consciousness among students so that they take action for conserving the environment.

 But, countered Ghose: The textbooks defeat the purpose of the syllabus and the subject.... They are too sketchy. If these issues are not introduced right from an early age, how will the children understand the gravity of the evils later.

 Publishers, however, said they have done their best. There was a time constraint, no doubt, but we have made sure that the books are absolutely new and in keeping with the purpose of the subject, which is to create environmental awareness, said Naveen Gupta, managing partner, Arya Publishing Company.

 Neeraj Gohil, director, operations, Frank Brothers amp; Co. echoed Gupta. However, there is always scope for improvement, he said.

 Grand plan for hotel

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Lalit Suri

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: Lalit Suri, who said I am very glad, will position Great Eastern Hotel as a premium heritage property with Grand being added to the name.

 Just got the good news today, an elated Suri told The Telegraph from London. 

 He said it would take a week or two before he signs and pays up for the property. 

 Suri will relaunch the 211-room property as The Grand Great Eastern Hotel, with a soft opening by the end of 2006. The addition to the name comes from the Grand Group of Hotels, an enterprise of Suris Bharat Hotels that bid for Great Eastern. 

 The Delhi-based hotelier- politician said: Its rooms will be priced similar to competitors like ITC and Taj Hotels.

 Great Eastern is a heritage property, a tag that brings with it restrictions on development. Suri, who owns two other heritage properties ? in Udaipur and Srinagar ? is confident of carrying out modernisation inside without touching the facade.

 In the past, Suri has had collaborations with Hilton and Holiday Inn and now has a tie-up with the Intercontinental.

 Suri does not believe Great Easterns location on one of Calcuttas busiest stretches of road is a handicap. There are similar heritage properties on crowded streets of London and New York and they do wonderfully well.

 A tourism expert said: He (Suri) has seen a meteoric rise in the hotel industry, the only one who showed political and commercial enterprise to pick up a hotel in Srinagar during the height of militancy. He then managed to bag three ITDC disinvested properties.

 The group had a gross profit of Rs 77 crore on a turnover of Rs 200 crore in 2004-05.

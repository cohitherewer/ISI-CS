 Shadow on weddings 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Nov. 23: Adhir Chowdhury has tied would-be brides and grooms in knots. 

 With large-scale violence feared on Monday ? when the state Congress has lined up a series of rallies to protest the Congress MPs arrest ? several families have shifted the venue of weddings. 

 Chowdhury will also be produced in court that day.

 Marriages are being moved outside Behrampore, some of them out of the district. 

 The Congress has announced a law-violation programme and a convention on Monday, in which all party MLAs and district presidents have been asked to take part. 

 Although police are making elaborate arrangements for Monday, residents of Behrampore, 200 km from Calcutta, are not convinced. 

 On November 20, when Adhir Chowdhury was last produced in court, there were a number of clashes between Congress supporters and the police. We feared there might be repeat on November 28, and the grooms family might be stuck on the way. So we decided to change the venue, said Jagadish Das, whose daughter Parna will tie the knot with a man from Hooghlys Serampore on Monday. 

 Das has shifted the venue to his brothers place in Serampore. The family is now busy informing guests about the last-minute change .

 Romita Chandas son Ajay, a resident of Behrampores Saidabad, will have to travel 12 km instead of 2 to bring his bride home. 

 His wife-to-be, Mitali Banik, lives a couple of kilometres away. But the Baniks have moved the venue of the wedding to Lalbagh, 12 km from Behrampore, to avoid trouble. 

 Many of our invitees are from Gorabazar and they would have had to pass the district magistrates office. The Congresss programmes are being organised close by. We feared our invitees might be in trouble? we are not taking chances, Romita Chanda said.

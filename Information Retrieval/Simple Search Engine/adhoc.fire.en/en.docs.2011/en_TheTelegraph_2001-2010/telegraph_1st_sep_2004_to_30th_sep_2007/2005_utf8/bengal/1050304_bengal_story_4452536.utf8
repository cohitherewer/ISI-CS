 Airhostess fraud 

 Calcutta, March 3: An Assam police team today arrested Amit Jha, who ran an airhostess training institute in Guwahati, from a house on Shakespeare Sarani. 

 Officers of the local police station who helped the Assam team track down Jha said he charged Rs 25,000 for the crashcourse, falsely claiming tie-ups with airlines and promising assured jobs. 

 An airhostess aspirant, who completed the course and failed to secure a job, had lodged a police complaint in Guwahati against Jha, who had been absconding.

 Kidnapper uncle dies in crash

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, July 27: Sabarul Islam, who was travelling to Jharkhand with his nephew who he had kidnapped, was killed today when his car collided head-on with a lorry. 

 The mishap, which took place on National Highway 34 at Shamsergunj in Murshidabad, 280 km from Calcutta, left the nephew, Sharif Hossain, Sabrauls brother Nefaul and three hired accomplices seriously injured. They have been admitted to Jangipur subdivisional hospital.

 We learnt that Sabarul was a resident of Barharwa of Jharkhand and was returning home after kidnapping his nephew, said Niraj Kumar Singh, the district superintendent of police.

 Sabarul, 35, had given Sharif Rs 4 lakh to buy two lorries in Bogdadnasgar in Shamsergunj, where Sharif lived, police said. He had purchased the vehicles in his own name, which enraged his uncle. 

 Sabarul came to his nephews house? and demanded to know why he had cheated him. Sharif tried to explain that it would have been difficult to register the lorries under his uncles name as he was a resident of Jharkhand, but he refused to listen. Sharif was then forced into a car, an official said.

 Nefaul told the police from his hospital bed that Sabarul had sold his land to raise Rs 4 lakh. We are not hardened kidnappers.... Our plan was to take Sharif to Barharwa and demand a Rs-4 lakh ransom. We would have released Sharif as soon as we received our money, he said.

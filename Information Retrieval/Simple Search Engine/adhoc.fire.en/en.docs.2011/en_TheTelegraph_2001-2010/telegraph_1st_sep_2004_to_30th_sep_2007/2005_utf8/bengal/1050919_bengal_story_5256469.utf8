 CM alert on rebel activity 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 18: The chief minister today said the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation (KLO) was making fresh attempts to reorganise itself in north Bengal and the Naxalites were trying to form a corridor through the region up to Nepal.

 But the Naxalites would not be able to form their desired corridor through Bengal, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said in the city at an awards-giving programme for state police personnel.

 We have defeated the Naxalites in every form ? politically, ideologically and through administrative means. They will not be able to form the channel to Nepal through this state, he said.

 The chief minister admitted that the Naxalites were creating problems, but that was because they were using the rugged terrain and forests in Jharkhand. It would not have been such a huge problem if it were not for the jungles and the mountains.

 Bengal, particularly its police force, has been the target of several attacks by the Naxalites, who have a firm base in at least three districts ? Purulia, Bankura and West Midnapore ? in the past few years.

 Bhattacharjees concern about the Maoists creating a corridor with Nepal springs from intelligence reports about a section of the rebel leaders from different countries, including Nepal and Sri Lanka, meeting in Bangladesh to chalk out plans to strengthen base in Bengal.

 The IB papers mention that the meet would focus on the state as the Maoists are not banned in Bengal. Two Maoist leaders from here are expected to participate in the meet.

 The chief minister, who is in charge of the police daprtment, claimed that law and order in Bengal was better compared with most others. Problems because of religious flare-ups or caste issues do not occur in the state. 

 Even then, crimes do take place, but the state after all, is part of the country, he said.

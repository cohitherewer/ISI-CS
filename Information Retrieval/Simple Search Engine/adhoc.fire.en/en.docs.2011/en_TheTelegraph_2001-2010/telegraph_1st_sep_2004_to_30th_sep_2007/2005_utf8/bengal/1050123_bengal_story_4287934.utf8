 CBSE strikes at stress 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 22: A fortnight after the head of the Delhi-based Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations asked principals of schools affiliated to it to reduce the burden of textbooks, the head of the Central Board of Secondary Education today announced measures to ensure stress-free education.

 ?The board has over 8,000 schools across India as well as in 20 other countries. We want to ensure that every child attending the schools, particularly those studying in the lower classes, is provided stress-free education. The heads of the schools have been advised to take a string of measures in this regard,? said CBSE chairman Ashoke Ganguly at a conference of principals of CBSE-affiliated institutions held at Birla High School today. 

 Ganguly asked the principals of the 100-odd schools of Bengal to adopt a number of steps towards making learning more enjoyable for students of lower classes. ?We have done away with the system of giving homework to students till Class V. No student is to be detained till Class V. No examinations are held at the primary level and schools are asked to conduct continuous evaluation. For assessing the performance of students till Class V, we are following a five-point gradation system,? he added. 

 The board, in keeping with an increasing emphasis on replacing marks with grades, has introduced a system of mentioning grades in mark sheets for the Class X and Class XII examinations. The CBSE plans to abolish the system of awarding marks, Ganguly said. 

 A meeting of the Centre of Boards of Secondary Education (Cobse) ? a national-level body of heads of education boards ? will be organised from January 27 to 29 in Kerala, in which the main topic of discussion would be examination reforms. ?We are waiting for a consensus of Cobse on the grade issue,? Ganguly said. If implemented, the grades awarded for Class X and Class XII examinations will be determined on the basis of a nine-point scale.

 The other measures to be implemented include more stress on application-based teaching of science subjects, inclusion of mathematics practical classes and setting up of mathematics laboratories, introduction of disaster management in social science, deletion of obsolete topics in social science and introduction of fashion studies, multimedia and web technology.

 A last look, with flowers and tears

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 26: Swami Ranganathanandaji, the president of Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission, was cremated at Belur Math this afternoon. 

 Devotees flocked to the math through the night to pay their homage. 

 An unusual gloom pervaded the pristine premises from the time the news of Ranganathanandaji?s death first arrived. Thousands from across the state and beyond came ? flowers in hand and tears in eyes. From Mumbai, Chennai, Ranchi and Hyderabad to places closer home, devotees streamed in. 

 Queues snaked their way through the premises as people waited patiently for a darshan. Devotional songs and scent of flowers filled the air rendered heavy by grief. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh sent a message, saying: ?In the passing away of Swami Ranganathananda, the world has lost a true sanyasi, in every sense of that term.?

 Governor Gopal Gandhi bowed to offer flowers at the feet of the great scholar. 

 The cremation took place around 12.40 pm. Before that, the body was taken from the Cultural Centre to the main temple and where Swami Vivekananda used to live, among other places in the math. 

 Before the cremation, there was the ritual snan (bathing) performed at Mayer Ghat on the Hooghly.

 As the pyre was lit, thousands stood with folded hands.

 A special puja would be held at Belur Math on May 7, a spokesperson said. ?It will be accompanied by a memorial meeting.?

 Maoists mean hope in hungry times

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Looking forward to nothing

 Dhangi Kusum (Belpahari), July 15: A plate of rice is a luxury for them and vegetables to go with it a dream. 

 Most of the 93 families earn about Rs 10 to Rs 12 a day by selling firewood or working as agricultural labourers for a few who own some land in this village in West Midnapore, about 200 km from Calcutta. 

 The residents here have not seen development work to write home about in the past decade.

 The tribal hamlet of Shabars and Bhumij ? located between two hills a stones throw from Jharkhand ? is about 15 km from Amlashol where five people had allegedly died of starvation a year ago. The villagers sympathise with the Maoists who, they feel, understand their woes and have launched a movement for their benefit.

 We dont want to know what our government thinks about the Maoists. They are our well-wishers and are fighting for our development. We fully support them, said Naren Singh, 35, one of the lucky few who owns about three bighas of land. But the land yields only one crop a year because there is hardly any irrigation. 

 This year, Singh said, the government has dug up a reservoir to hold rainwater. It is inadequate for irrigation. Still, something has come up. And that was because of the movement launched by the jangaler lok (the forest people, as the Naxalites are known in the region), he said.

 The Maoists often go through the village on their way to meetings at Belpahari, Banspahari or Odalchua.

 But a measure of the governments lack of concern could be had in the words of Narens 80-year-old uncle, Bharat Singh. There has been no change in this village since I was born 80 years ago. Nothing has been done for us. I have seen the BDO (block development officer) visit the village only once, 20 years ago. The leaders come before elections, he said. 

 The area, surrounded by dense forest and on difficult terrain, once a CPM stronghold, is now dominated by the Jharkhand Party in the local polls. 

 Getting to eat a thala (plate) of bhat (rice) is a luxury... a preparation of vegetables a dream, said Ramani Singh, who doesnt remember when she last provided adequate food to her two children, Simati and Mukunda. 

 Others like Sumitra, Urmila and Parbati have the same story to tell. We collect firewood from the forest and climb up the Karadoba hill to sell it in a market in Jharkhand and get between Rs 5 and Rs 10, said Sumitra.

 Our children dont go to school. When we cant feed our children properly how can we think about their education?

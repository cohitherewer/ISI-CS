 CM unveils plan to make up land loss

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bhojerhat, Sept. 26: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today sought to placate the CPMs South 24-Parganas unit by assuring a gathering that the government would provide houses and jobs to families of farmers who lose their land to industry. 

 The chief minister also said that the government would not acquire any land in Bhangar, about 30 km from Calcutta, for the projects proposed by the Salim Group as the land here yields several crops. 

 Bhangar had featured prominently on the governments list of proposed sites for a special economic zone or a township to be set up by the Indonesia-based conglomerate. 

 During his 30-minute speech, the chief minister never mentioned Salim. 

 We will not touch land that yields multiple-crops or on which stand houses belonging to farmers for carrying out development work. We might, however, have to take small portions of land from some farmers, in lieu of which we will give a fair price, offer alternative accommodation and a job to a member of each family whose land is acquired, Bhattacharjee said. 

 This was his first public meeting in South 24-Parganas since the controversy broke out within the CPM over the proposed Salim projects and the move to convert farmland for industry. 

 Mamata Banerjee will address a meeting at the same venue on October 1. 

 Bhattacharjee said no country can survive and prosper by banking on agriculture alone. We cannot ignore agriculture, but still we will not prosper unless we take initiatives to develop industries in our state, he said.

 We know our state better than our Opposition parties. We know what crop grows on which land. We know that it will not be very wise to touch multi-crop lands. We have not gone mad that we will take over such land indiscriminately, without judging what these lands are producing, Bhattacharjee assured the gathering, which comprised mostly farmers and their families.

 He said the government as well as the CPM has been calculating the loss and gains to be made by setting up industries and going ahead with development projects ? like building roads ? by sacrificing agricultural land.

 I have asked Abdur Rezzak Molla (the land and land reforms minister), Kanti Ganguly (the Sunderbans development minister) and others in our party to calculate very carefully how much loss we might incur by taking land for setting up industrial units. We have to ensure that our agriculture does not suffer, he added. 

 Molla, the MLA from Canning (East) that includes parts of Bhangar, admitted that there was some initial lack of understanding within the party over the proposed projects and the conversion of farmland. Later, we thrashed out the matter within our party and there is now a consensus in favour of industries, he said. 

 Molla also asked the farmers not to hand over their plots to land sharks. 

 They will tell you that the government will take away your land without giving you the right price. Dont believe them.

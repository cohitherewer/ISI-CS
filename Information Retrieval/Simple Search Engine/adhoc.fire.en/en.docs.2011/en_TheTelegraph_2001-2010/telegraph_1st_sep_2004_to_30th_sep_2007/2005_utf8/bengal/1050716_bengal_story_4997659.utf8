 People can spot accused, not police 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, July 15: Laila Khatun had managed to escape pimps in Mumbai, but back home, she is still trapped in a nightmare with police refusing to act against the youth who tried to sell her off after weaving dreams of a life together.

 Ujjal Mian is roaming free, though the police say he is absconding, and 15-year-old Laila is being threatened.

 Her father Latibur Rahman said Ujjal returned to Mahisgram, about 245 km from Calcutta, from Mumbai early this month. 

 All of us in the village know that Ujjal is back, said Rabindranath Biswas. His neighbour, Ruhul Miya, echoed him.

 Ujjal and his father are roaming the village, but the police are doing nothing. Banai Miya, a casual worker at the local telephone exchange, is going to work everyday and threatening us? asking us to withdraw our complaint. 

 When I went to Burwan police station to lodge a complaint against the threats, the officials there refused to accept it. The police told us that both Ujjal and his father are absconding. But it is common knowledge in the village that the father and son are very much present, said Latibur.

 This was not the first time when the police station refused to accept Lailas complaint.

 She first went to the Burwan police station on June 12 to lodge a complaint against Ujjal. The officer-in-charge refused to register it. The police accepted the complaint over a fortnight later, after Laila saw Murshidabad superintendent of police Sanjay Singh.

 Ujjals mother Champa Bibi was picked up. She is still in jail custody, but the police have done little else.

 Laila was lured by the promise of marriage and a life in Mumbai into a relationship with Ujjal. Once there, he asked her to proceed with a couple of strangers. She refused. They fled when Laila raised an alarm. She then somehow managed to get in touch with a neighbour working there as a mason, who contacted her father. 

 The Telegraph had reported a series of incidents of girls going missing from the state and also Lailas ordeal in getting the police complaint lodged (see graphic). 

 She said: We are unable to sleep in peace at night. My father and I are hopping from one neighbours house to another every night to get some sleep. We have been told that we will be murdered if we do not withdraw the case against Ujjal and his father.

 Burwan officer-in-charge Pabitra Kumar Mostafi reiterated that Ujjal and his father are absconding. He also said: Latibur is not telling the truth, so we have not accepted his complaint. The district police chief, however, said Mostafi has been asked to arrest the father-son duo immediately.

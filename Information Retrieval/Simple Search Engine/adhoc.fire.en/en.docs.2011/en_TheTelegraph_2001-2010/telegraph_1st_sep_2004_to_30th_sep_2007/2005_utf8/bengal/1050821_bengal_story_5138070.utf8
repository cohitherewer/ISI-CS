 Lights out on runway, airport in the dark

 SANJAY MANDAL

 Landing trouble 

 Calcutta, Aug. 20: What has happened to the approach lights? Why are they not glowing?

 The SOS came from a British Airways pilot at 5 am yesterday. Till then, authorities at Calcutta airport had no idea that the approach lights on the runway were not working.

 The pilot faced problems in landing as the circuit of approach lights on the main runway snapped, a senior official of the Airports Authority of India (AAI) said today.

 After the pilot of the flight from London ? BA 147 ? complained, the authorities carried out an inspection.

 A cargo plane of Singapore Airlines was also about to land at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport and faced the same problem. 

 The control panel did not indicate that the circuit had gone out of order and this caused delay in rectifying the fault. But soon the second circuit, which acts as a back-up, was switched on and flights operated with its help, the official said. 

 The circuit was restored at 8.15 am.

 It seems that the lights went out due to faults in cables and switches. But there is need for a detailed probe, said another AAI officer. 

 Engineering department officials said the rains could have caused the cable faults. 

 We are investigating the incident, said B. K. Goswami, deputy general manager, operations, Calcutta airport.

 Lights on the main runways edge and approach have two circuits. When the first goes off, the second is switched on to avoid disruption of flights. 

 However, if the back-up circuit also fails to function, the airport is plunged into a crisis like the one in January this year. Flight schedules had been thrown off gear after a technical problem caused the lights to go out for several hours. 

 The approach lights cover 900 metres before the threshold of the runway.

 The lights are under constant surveillance but even then they are creating problems. The matter has been reported to the higher authorities, said an official.

 Air Deccan snag

 An Air Deccan flight from Calcutta to Bagdogra returned midway after it developed a technical snag. 

 Officials at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport said the flight left for Bagdogra at 9.30 am but returned soon after. The flight was later cancelled, airlines sources said.

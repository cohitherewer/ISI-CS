 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, July 17: Biplab Dasgupta, a CPM Rajya Sabha member, died here this afternoon following a heart attack. He was 66 and suffering from Parkinsons disease for the past three years.

 Dasgupta is survived by his widow Arati, the state Citu vice-president, and son Shammo. An economics professor, he taught both in India and England. Dasgupta, a former member of the CPM central Committee, joined the undivided communist party in 1955. He was to complete his tenure in the Upper House next April. He won the Lok Sabha polls in 1989 defeating the late Bhola Sen of the Congress, but lost to Mamata Banerjee in 1991. Dasgupta wrote several books and articles and the latest ? Globalisation-Indias Adjustment Experience ? was to be unveiled by the Prime Minister this month. 

 Durgapur: Babban Dube, a cashier of Asansol Engineering College, battered his wife to death after trying to slit her throat following a quarrel late on Friday night. Police said before fleeing, he tied up his four children ? two sons and two daughters aged between six and 12 ? to the bed. District police chief Peeyush Pandey said a search for Dubey has begun.

 Calcutta: The government is likely to decide on Monday its next move to resolve the tea garden impasse. Labour minister Mohammad Amin will brief the chief minister on Saturdays tripartite meeting in which trade unions, tea garden owners and government officials failed to thrash out a solution as the strike entered its sixth day. The unions have called a 12-hour bandh in north Bengal on Tuesday.

Calcutta, Sept. 19: When 

 the government is trying to up- grade the quality of undergraduate 

 education by creating nearly 300 new lecturer posts, the 

 College Service Commission is finding it difficult to get 

 suitable candidates to fill up vacancies that already exist.

 The commission is now set to open doors to candidates from other states for filling up the vacant posts.

 Officials admitted today that acute shortage of good candidates in the state has prompted the commission to get the posts filled up with candidates from elsewhere.

 The commission would embark on the exercise to fill up over 2,000 vacancies in over 300 colleges across Bengal tomorrow. Of the 2,000, 200 are new posts sanctioned by the government this year.

 This is the first time in decades that so many college teachers would be appointed at one go. We are ready to fill the vacancies with candidates from other states if we do not find suitable candidates here, said commission chairman A.K. Banik.

 After a statewide survey carried out last month, the commission realised that academic activities were suffering in many colleges, mostly in the rural areas, because of the vacancies.

 The study also identified several reasons behind the large number of vacancies in rural colleges. One reason ? which concerns the commission most ? is the paltry number of candidates qualifying in the state-level eligibility test (SLET), an examination conducted by the commission every year for lecturer post aspirants.

 There are nearly 212 posts vacant in political science, 215 in English and 119 in Sanskrit. But there are not more than 150 suitable candidates (SLET or NET ? national eligibility test ? qualified) available in political science and English and even less in Sanskrit. The UGC conducts NET to recruit lecturers across the country.

 Another factor contributing to the teacher crisis is the tendency among qualified candidates to only join colleges close to Calcutta. 

 Apart from encouraging applicants from other states, the commission has taken a string of measures to stop candidates from refusing to accept posts in the districts.

 It has restricted candidates from opting for a posting of choice anywhere in the state ? a system practised till last year. Under the new rule, candidates will have to opt for one of the five universities under which the 340 colleges are affiliated ? Calcutta, Burdwan, Vidyasagar, Kalyani and North Bengal. 

 For instance, if anyone chooses Calcutta University, they will be given a posting at any one of the 200 colleges under it. Banik said: Now the option is restricted to a smaller jurisdiction. Candidates will have to be more careful. This will reduce the tendency to refuse postings.

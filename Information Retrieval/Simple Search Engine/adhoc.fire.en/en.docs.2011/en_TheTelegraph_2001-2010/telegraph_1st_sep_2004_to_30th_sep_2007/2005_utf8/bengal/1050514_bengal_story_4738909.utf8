 Subrata faces fire from Cong ranks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 13: On the eve of Pranab Mukherjees arrival in the city to iron out differences between Subrata Mukherjee and Somen Mitra over selection of civic candidates, senior leader Jayanta Bhattacharya called the mayors pact with the Congress an opportunist alliance. 

 Congress leaders said fresh hitches have developed with the mayor refusing to accept the partys candidates in 10 wards in addition to ward 48. We have problems in several wards. We are looking forward to Pranabda breaking the deadlock, Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said.

 A week ago, Pranab Mukherjee, also the defence minister, had announced that the Congress and the mayors Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha ? which also includes a string of eight smaller parties ? will contest the ensuing civic polls together under the banner of the United Democratic Alliance. 

 Today, Bhattacharya, a Rajya Sabha member, said: This is nothing but Subratas calculated move to damage the Congress in the run-up to the civic polls. Bhattacharya was elected to the Upper House as a Trinamul Congress-backed Independent from Bengal in 1999.

 A person who has betrayed Mamata Banerjee after enjoying power as mayor for five years with her blessings, cannot do good to our party with an alliance just 20 days ahead of the polls. I believe the Congress, which has improved its position in Bengal, would have fared better without tying up with Subrata, he observed. 

 Bhattacharya, known to be a confidant of Mitra, a former state Congress chief, also said that it was Subrata Mukherjee who stood in opposition when we had prevailed on Mamata to tie up with the Congress in 2001, just before the Assembly elections. We apprehend that Subrata is taking us for a ride and our party leaders should be cautious. He (Subrata) is acting as the CPMs agent. 

 That is also Mamatas charge against the mayor. Only she thinks it is aimed at ruining Trinamul.

 Chicago varsity link to Bengali research

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Jan. 8: Burdwan University has taken an initiative to exchange study and research material on Bengali language and literature with Chicago University.

 The move, which comes in the wake of the University Grants Commission allowing the setting up of a Centre for Advanced Studies, would see the Bengali department of the varsity exchanging materials on translation and research with the Chicago University?s department of South Asian Language, Literature and Culture.

 The exchange programme will be kicked off during the visit of the joint director of the Chicago varsity department, Clinton B Silly, to Burdwan University?s Bengali department to hold a series of classes from next week. Silly, who has translated into English Jibananda?s Banalata Sen, Michael Madhusudan Dutt?s Meghnad Badh Kabya and Buddhadeb Basu?s poems, had visited the varsity earlier this month.

 The Bengali department was selected by UGC for India?s first comparative study of the literature of eastern Indian languages and Rs 54 lakh was sanctioned for setting up the Centre for Advanced Studies. Of this, Rs 14.76 lakh has already been sanctioned for the first phase of work, according to sources in the department.

 Sumita Chakrabarty, Burdwan University?s dean of arts, said work on a dictionary on languages in eastern India has already started. Efforts are on to coordinate with inter national universities for the upgradation of the department, she said. ?Recently, we have roped in a novelist from Bangladesh, Hasan Ajijul Haque, to hold classes,? she said.

 ?Chicago University is one of the few universities in the world that has a dedicated department on Southeast Asian studies. Besides, its translation works are of a very high standard,? said the dean.

 Burdwan University?s registrar, Shoroshi Mohan Dawn, said there are plans to send students across as part of the exchange programme to carry out studies on various aspects of Bengali language and literature.

 ?This is for the first time we have taken such an initiative as Chicago University has a sound Bengali department. Our students will be enriched by the exchange of ideas and study material on Bengali language and literature. We are also looking forward to the day when our students can visit Chicago University on exchange programmes,? he said.

 Varsity officials said they established contact with Chicago University when Selly when arrived in Calcutta in the last week of December.

 ?We contacted Selly and requested him to visit Burdwan University. We held discussions on the exchange programmes. He agreed to our proposal on exchange of ideas on Bengali language and literature. He also agreed to interactions between students and teachers of the two universities. But, there is no immediate proposal to exchange researches,? an official said.

 As the exchange programme progresses, students can come from Chicago University to Burdwan and Bengali students from here can visit the foreign varsity, Dawn said.

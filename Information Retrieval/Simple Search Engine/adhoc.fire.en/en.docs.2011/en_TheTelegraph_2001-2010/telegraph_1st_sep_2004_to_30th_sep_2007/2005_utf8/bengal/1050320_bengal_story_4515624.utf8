 Bystander killed in bus race

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 19: Reckless driving claimed the sixth accident victim of the week today as a bus lost control while overtaking another and ploughed into a group of pedestrians, crushing to death a 40-year-old bystander.

 The private bus knocked Hafiz Mohammad Alamgir from D. C. Dey Road down on APC Road near Sealdah this morning. At least four pedestrians had a narrow escape as they managed to jump out of the way.

 As the news of the accident spread, people from a nearby locality rushed to the spot and squatted on the road. They blocked the road for over half-an-hour in protest against the rash driving and demanded the immediate arrest of the driver, who fled leaving behind the bus.

 With today?s incident, the total number of traffic deaths this week went up to six.

 According to police, the incident took place around 10.30 am when the victim was standing on the road waiting for a bus. ?The private bus on route no 202 was heading towards the Sealdah flyover. The driver of the bus lost control after overtaking a minibus of Shyambazar?Golpark route,? said a police officer.

 ?Alamgir did not notice the bus hurtling towards him. On seeing the speeding bus, the other pedestrians fled. Had the other people failed to notice the bus, it could have claimed more lives,? the officer said.

 The driver of the bus ran away. The two conductors and the helper, too, escaped.

 Banibrata Basu, the special additional commissioner of police (traffic department), said: ?The police have been directed to track down the drivers who flee after mishaps.?

 Pranab set for second stint 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 30: Union defence minister Pranab Mukherjee appears set to get a second term as state Congress president. 

 With the Assembly elections slated next year, the party high command wants him to steer the faction-ridden unit to take on the ruling Left Front.

 Mukherjee, who is number two in the Manmohan Singh cabinet, had said he was unwilling to continue as he could not devote enough time to the state because he was so busy in Delhi. 

 However, the high command is banking on him to stem the rot in the beleaguered state organisation, sources said. 

 A general body meeting has been lined up for June 7, in which the 443-odd state Congress members will adopt a unanimous resolution requesting party president Sonia Gandhi to elect a new PCC chief through consensus, former state Congress chief Somen Mitra said today.

 Birendra Kataria from Delhi will attend the meeting as the Pradesh Returning Officer. 

 Mitra, who is a contender for the crown, made it clear that he will not be in the race if Mukherjee seeks a second term. 

 In all probability, Pranabda is going to continue as PCC chief till next years Assembly elections, said Pradip Bhattacharya, another leader vying for the post.

 Mukherjee first took over as ad hoc president in 2000 replacing the ailing MP from Malda, A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury. He was elected president through consensus in June, 2001.

 The sources said Mukherjee is the high commands natural choice as any other candidate would trigger a serious contest.

 Apart from Mitra and Bhattacharya, there are several other aspirants for the top post, including Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and PCC general secretary Manas Bhuniya.

 Mukherjee has blamed factionalism for the partys poor showing in the elections to 79 municipalities. Against this backdrop, his primary job after getting elected will be to mend the cracks.

 Congress sources said Mukherjee would be given a free hand to firmly deal with those involved in mud-slinging within the organisation. 

 In no way are we going to allow factionalism to weaken the organisation. Instead, a united effort is necessary to take on the communists in next years Assembly polls, Mukherjee had said yesterday before leaving for Delhi.

 He will kick off the campaign for the forthcoming civic body elections at a meeting in central Calcutta on June 2, to be organised under the banner of the newly-floated United Democratic Alliance. 

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee, convener of the Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha, and leaders from other anti-CPM parties will participate in the rally.

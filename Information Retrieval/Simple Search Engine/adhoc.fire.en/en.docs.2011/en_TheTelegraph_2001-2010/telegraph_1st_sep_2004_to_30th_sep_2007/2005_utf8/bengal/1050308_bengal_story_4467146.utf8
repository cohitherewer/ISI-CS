 Crash claims 5 of a family

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Raiganj, March 7: Little Nipu struggled to breathe at Raiganj Hospital, his face swathed in bandages. 

 The one-and-half-year boy has not opened his eyes since 10 in the morning when the Maruti Omni in which he was travelling with his family was smashed by a speeding bus at Hemtabad, 20 km from here. 

 Nipu was the only one to survive the crash. The collision killed eight of the nine passengers in the van. Among them were his father, Pralay Nandi, 35, mother Simki Nandi, 30, sister Gouri, 10, brother Pradip, 8, and uncle Raju, 27. 

 The other three were the driver, Chandan Chauhan, 20, and two of Raju?s friends, Swapan Pal, 25, and Mithu Sarkar, 22. 

 The family was on its way to Purnea, Bihar, to visit Simki?s ailing father. ?My father is very sick and was desperate to see Simki. So my younger brother, Raju, hired a car from Purnea yesterday and, along with two of his friends, went to Dalimgaon (North Dinajpur) to bring my sister,? said a sobbing Samir Pal. 

 Samir reached Raiganj around 4 pm after being told about the accident by Hemtabad police. ?We tried to keep the news from our father, but he got to know somehow and has already suffered a stroke,? he said.

 At Kakarsingh, the site of the accident, the mangled cream Omni stood beside the road. Blood and bits of twisted metal, shards of glass and belongings of the dead were strewn over about 100 metres . 

 Masiur Ali, a witness, said: ?I was working in the field when I heard the bang. When I ran towards the road, the bus was still in motion... It was travelling at such speed that even after hitting the car, it could not stop for 100 metres or so. The Omni was ripped apart.?

 The farmers used spades and sickles to cut open the vehicle. ?Only a woman and a child were breathing,? said Ali.

 Son killed over repellent

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Sept. 3: A couple murdered their son today ? with the help of the youths younger brother and maternal uncle ? apparently over mosquito repellent.

 Police arrested Dulal Chowdhury, Sumitra and her brother, Shibu Goswami, and recovered the half-burnt body of 26-year-old Jagabandhu from a crematorium at Munsefur village under Budbud police station. Dinabandhu, the deceaseds brother, fled.

 Jagabandhu was a grocer, was married and had a six-year-old son.

 Trouble started at the Chowdhury home in Burdwan district, about 140 km from Calcutta, a little past midnight yesterday when Jagabandhu asked his father to give him the mosquito repellent that he was using.

 Heated exchanges followed. The retired railway employee then started hitting his son on the head with a hammer. Jagabandhu fell to the ground bleeding profusely.

 According to Burdwan police superintendent Piyush Pandey, Dulals younger son told his father that they should kill Jagabandhu and started stabbing his elder brother. Sumitra also apparently asked her younger son to kill his brother. Sumitra then went to her fathers house in the village to call her brother, Shibu.

 By the time the grocers wife informed her parents, the Chowdhury family had carried the body to the crematorium and lighted the pyre. However, other villagers rushed to prevent them from cremating the body.

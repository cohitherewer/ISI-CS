 Fast ends, ball in Centre court

 MAIN UDDIN CHISTI

 Bhetaguri, Sept. 23: The hunger strike for Greater Cooch Behar ended this afternoon after the district magistrate declared that the matter had been taken up with the Union home ministry.

 But Bangshibadan Barman, the secretary of the Greater Cooch Behar Peoples Association, warned that they would be back on the protest path if a suitable reply did not come from Delhi. 

 Emerging from a meeting with district magistrate Ravi Inder Singh, Barman said: We will wait till October 15 when the district magistrate has convened a meeting to inform us about the Centres reply. If the answer is negative, we would again sit on a hunger strike.

 Barman also told Singh to ensure that political parties did not disrupt his outfits meetings. In the past, weve been attacked and our loudspeakers and amplifiers damaged by CPM and Forward Bloc cadre. The district magistrate gave us his assurance on the security, he said.

 Singh said he had told the representatives of the association that the people who had come from far-flung places to participate in the agitation would be escorted home.

 At Writers Buildings, officials said they were in touch with the Centre. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee spoke to home minister Shivraj Patil during the day about the developments. 

 Home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy said: We are sending their demands to the Centre along with our views. The protesters have been asked to get in touch with the district magistrate in a month. 

 The issue was discussed at length at the CPM state secretariat meeting, where Bhattacharjee and Jyoti Basu were present.

 Around 7 pm, North Bengal State Transport Corporation buses left with the prot-esters for places like Haldibari, Tufanganj, Balarampur and villages across the Dinhata subdivision.

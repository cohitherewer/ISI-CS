 Sector V: Summer dressing

 Calcutta, April 30: With Salt Lake?s Sector V fast becoming the industrial face of the east, the state government is planning to give it a grand makeover.

 ?We are going to ensure all amenities of a state-of-the-art industrial town in Sector V. And that would include a clean green locale with great facilities,? said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya.

 The facelift will not only provide civic amenities, he added, but will offer scope for entertainment and create ?a pleasant surrounding soothing to the eyes? in the region?s first full-fledged IT hub.

 The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government feels that improving facilities is a crucial aspect of an image makeover. So apart from improvement of roads, facilities for drinking water, sewerage, drainage and solid waste management, the beautification plan will include building public toilets, bus stops, taxi stands and parking lots. 

 ?These are the bare minimum necessities and very essential to keep a township clean and in order,? said a senior official of the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority. 

 After the township is scrubbed and clean, it will be time to go green. An afforestation plan is being drawn up and the government promises to paint every nook and corner of Sector V green. Beautification of parks and boulevards, apart from planting of thousands of trees is on the cards.

 There will also be provisions for entertainment and leisure. Jogging tracks, gymnasium, cafeteria, food courts, improved footpaths are on the agenda. 

 ?All the new additions like bus stops, taxi stands, parking lots, cafeteria and so on would have to be complemented with greenery in order to make Sector V breathe clean and fresh air,? an official said.

 The beautification drive, the government feels, will make the entire city more attractive to investors. It hopes private companies will pump in crores for Calcutta?s development.

 The government will rope in private companies for the Sector V project. ?We will go for public-private partnership in this,? the urban development minister said. 

 A committee headed by urban development secretary K.S. Rajendrakumar is examining the project. ?We have already created a blueprint for the project. However, some last minute discussions are pending,? a senior official of the state urban development department said.

 The grander the dream, fatter the bills. Rajendrakumar said: ?The total amount of funds required for the entire beautification project has not yet been finalised as there are a number of components ? food courts, pavements, jogging tracks, etc. ? in it.?

 The government plans to ask private companies to build the amenities and maintain them and, in turn, they can raise the money invested by placing hoardings.

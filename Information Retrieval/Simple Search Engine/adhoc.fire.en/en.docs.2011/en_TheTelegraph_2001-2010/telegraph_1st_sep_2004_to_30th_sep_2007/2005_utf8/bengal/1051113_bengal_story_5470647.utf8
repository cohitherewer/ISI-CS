 Tigress enters kitchen

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, Nov. 12: Bhupen Mistri spied the tail of a tigress in his kitchen last night when he got out of bed to investigate a foul smell.

 Closing the door noiselessly, he rushed out of the house with his wife and children and alerted neighbours at Hemnagar village in Bashirhat, about 100 km from Calcutta.

 The panic-stricken villagers went to police, who in turn informed forest officials. 

 We received information from the locals around 6.45 this morning that a tigress had entered the fringe areas of the tiger reserve at Hingalgange. We immediately sent officials there, said Pradip Vyas, director of the Sunderban Tiger Reserve.

 Meanwhile, the eight-year-old tigress, which had landed in the village by swimming across the Haldi river, had broken down the kitchen door and gone out into a paddy field.

 Police and forest officials arrived in the North 24-Parganas villages in the morning and encircled the field. We initially tried to net the tigress, but finally we had to shoot her with tranquilliser around 10 am, Vyas said.

 The unconscious animal was loaded on to a speedboat and taken to the core area of the tiger reserve, where it was released.

 But Hemnagar residents, worried this could happen again, asked for forest guards for their village.

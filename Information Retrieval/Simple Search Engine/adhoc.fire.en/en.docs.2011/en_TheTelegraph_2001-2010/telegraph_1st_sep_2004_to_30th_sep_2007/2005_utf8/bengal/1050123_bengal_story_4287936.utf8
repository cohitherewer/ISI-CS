 Cabbie held for drugging family 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Jan. 22: A 21-year-old taxi driver was arrested today on charges of looting a family by rendering them unconscious using drugs three days ago. 

 Kanchan Jadhav was identified by the couple and also their three-year-old daughter. He has been remanded in police custody. 

 Police said Raghunath Mandal and his wife Purba had hired the cab from Howrah station on January 19. ?They were on their way to Assam from Chennai via Calcutta. They, with Meenu and one-year-old son Babu, hired the taxi to go to a relative?s house in Taratala,? said Anuj Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (south division).

 ?As we came near the approach road to Vidyasagar Setu, the helper of the taxi took out a piece of red cloth and held it before us. Soon, we fell unconscious. When we regained consciousness at hospital, we found our belongings, including Rs 4,000, missing,? said Mandal in his complaint with Maidan police station. 

 Personnel from the police station had noticed the family lying by the wayside. ?When we went close to them, we found all of them unconscious. It seems the taxi driver and his helper dumped the four after robbing them. We admitted Mandal, who is a sculptor, and his wife to Sambhunath Pandit Hospital and their children to a nearby health-care unit,? said Asish Sengupta, officer-in-charge of Maidan police station. 

 The Mandals regained consciousness the next day and immediately helped with the investigation. ?He did an excellent job which helped us track down the taxi driver. After hiring the vehicle, he wrote down the number of the taxi in his personal diary,? said an official of Maidan police station. 

 Armed with the number, the police swung into action. ?We contacted the public vehicles department and collected the details of the vehicle. The traffic department was also contacted to get more information about the taxi,? he added. 

 Police conducted several raids without any luck. But this evening, they received a specific tip and Kanchan was arrested from Tollygunge. 

 Mandal and his wife identified Kanchan at first sight. ?The child Meenu, too, identified the driver. Kanchan is being interrogated and his helper is expected to be arrested within a day or two,? said DC Sharma. 

 He added that the owner of the vehicle too would be questioned to confirm how many people were involved in the robbery.

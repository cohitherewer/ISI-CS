 Fugitive MP at industry showcase

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Adhir Chowdhury

 Calcutta, Nov. 13: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees police want to arrest him in connection with two recent murders, but the India Trade Promotion Organisation, it seems, wants Adhir Chowdhury to share the dais with the chief minister in Delhi tomorrow.

 The Congress MP from Behrampore, a proclaimed absconder, has been invited to Pragati Maidan for the opening of the India-International Trade Fair 2005. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will flag off the event in which Bengal, with its new zeal to invite industry, will be the focal point.

 The MP said over phone this afternoon that he had been invited to the programme by N.N. Khanna, the chair- man-cum-managing director of the trade promotion organisation. I shall attend the programme where the chief minister will also be present. Being the man in charge of police, Buddhababu can get me arrested there, he added with a chuckle.

 The MP said he would later sit with CPM Rajya Sabha member Nilotpal Basu at a meeting of the parliamentary standing committee on roads. Basu is the chairman of the committee and I shall present a paper on the deteriorating condition of national highways going through the state. They will also discuss the National Highway Authority of Indias performance.

 Home secretary P.R. Roy was not available for comment, but officials at Writers Buildings ruled out Chowdhury being picked up from Delhi. The Murshidabad chief judicial magistrate has asked him to surrender by December 5.

 Police have pasted a copy of the order declaring him an absconder on the door of his Behrampore house. 

 On the phone, Chowdhury reiterated that he was against surrendering as I have been falsely implicated as part of a CPM conspiracy. 

 The MP and his wife Arpita are among those accused in connection with the murders of a father and son, who shifted loyalties to a faction of the Congress opposed to Chowdhury in Behrampore.

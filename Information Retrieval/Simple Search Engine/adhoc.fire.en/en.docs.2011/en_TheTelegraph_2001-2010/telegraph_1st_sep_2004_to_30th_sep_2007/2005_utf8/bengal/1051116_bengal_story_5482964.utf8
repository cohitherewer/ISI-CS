 School heads punished for meal mess

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Nov. 15: Headmasters of four schools in Nadia have been demoted and transferred elsewhere for laundering money meant for childrens mid-day meals.

 Teachers have been told to sign money receipts for the meal scheme from now on.

 Officials said the headmasters ? Dhananjoy Ghosh of Mathpara Primary School and S.K. Kundu of Bottala Primary School in Nakashipara, Nurul Hasan Mallick of Purba Para Primary School in Dhubulia and Basudev Haldar of Gaharpota Primary School in Kaligunj ? were transferred to other schools in the district as teachers-in-charge.

 We carried out separate inquiries following complaints that they were diverting the money for the mid-day meals. None of them was able to provide a satisfactory explanation. We are probing similar charges against two headmasters of schools in Hanskhali and Krishnagunj, said Bibhash Biswas, the chairman of the Nadia primary school council. 

 Biswas, however, said the allegation of siphoning of funds could not be established against the four. A chunk of the funds was diverted and spent on other programmes like development of the school building, he added.

 So, the authorities cannot press criminal charges against them.

 Guardians and members of village education committees had complained that the mid-day meals served to children in the four schools whose headmasters were punished were of inferior quality because funds meant for the food were being diverted. 

 Biswas said: Now on, the money would not be handed over to headmasters. The money receipts for mid-day meals will have to be signed by all schoolteachers. 

 Block development officers will only accept receipts signed by the teachers.

 There are about 3,000 primary schools in Nadia. The government used to provide the schools Re 1 per student per day as money for the meals. It doubled the allocation earlier this year so that the students were provided better food. 

 Many schools, which earlier only fed khichudi, started providing meat and eggs at regular intervals. But many schools did not change the menu. 

 Our probe has revealed that the headmasters deliberately did not spice up the meal menu even after the daily allotment for every student was made Rs 2 because they wanted to use the money for other needs of the school, said Biswas.

 Dhananjoy Ghosh was one such headmaster. He faced the guardians fury in June and was gheraoed for eight hours until a police team rescued him.

 Doctor amp; leader in murder trial

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Howrah, April 4: Four people arrested by CID sleuths in connection with the murder of Dr Sushil Pal were acquitted today, but nine others, including a doctor and an expelled CPM leader, will be tried at the subdivisional judicial magistrate?s court here.

 Pal, a gynaecologist, was killed apparently after he refused to abort the child of a woman in her early stage of pregnancy. Thirteen people, including a member of the CPM?s Uluberia zonal committee, were arrested in connection with the murder last July. 

 The 45-year-old doctor had left his in-laws? residence on Bright Street in south Calcutta for his workplace ? Serampore Walsh Hospital ? as usual but had not attended office on July 3.

 The four acquitted because of lack of evidence by the Howrah subdivisional judicial magistrate, Shyamal Chakrabarty, were Biswanath Kangsabanik, Krishnendu Sandhukhan, Rajiv Nath and Jayanta Ghosh. Those remanded in judicial custody till further hearing included the CPM member, Biswajyoti Bose.

 Police today filed a conspiracy-and-murder case against Piyali Das Mondal, who was the resident medical officer of Bally Matri Sadan, and Bose. The leader, who owns Sebayatan nursing home where Pal was allegedly killed, and Piyali were said to be ?directly involved? in the murder. The two had also allegedly conspired to tamper with the attendance register of the nursing home where Pal had examined the pregnant woman.

 Blood paucity hits patients

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, July 30: A severe shortage of blood in Burdwan Medical College Hospital is taking its toll on patients. 

 Nineteen-year-old Anjana Halder died last night by the time her relatives could arrange a pouch of AB positive blood from the hospitals bank. The death comes in the wake of humiliation a 60-year-old man was subjected to by a group-D employee at the blood bank for waking him up early in the morning.

 Anjana, who gave birth to a boy at her Kalna residence on Thursday night, was admitted to the medical college yesterday morning. The doctor advised the patients relatives to procure a bottle of AB positive blood immediately, but blood bank authorities on the campus said there was no stock of blood of the particular group and asked them to bring a donor.

 The relatives brought a donor at 5 pm, but the blood could not be sent to the ward where the patient was admitted because of a lack staff. By the time the blood reached the ward around 9 pm yesterday, the patient died.

 This morning, Anjanas relatives demonstrated with her body in front of Burdwan police station and dispersed only when senior officials assured them a probe would be ordered into the alleged negligence of blood-bank employees.

 Medical college superintendent Sarit Chowdhury has also promised action against blood-bank employees who are found to have been negligent. But the crisis of blood has deepened as we are unable to procure blood, he admitted.

 Hospital authorities have instituted a three-member panel, chaired by the head of the gynaecology department, Debashis Bhattacharya, to probe the alleged negligence.

 We sent the requisition for a bottle of blood to the blood bank. But the blood reached us very late. I cannot say right now what the reason is behind the delay, Bhattacharya said, admitting that Anjana died due to lack of blood.

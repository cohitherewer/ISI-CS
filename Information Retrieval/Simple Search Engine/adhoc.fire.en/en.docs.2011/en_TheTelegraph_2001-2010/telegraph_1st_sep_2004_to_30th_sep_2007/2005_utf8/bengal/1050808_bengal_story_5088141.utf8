 Chemicals for crops take a toll on tillers 

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Barasat, Aug. 7: Chemical fertilisers used to grow crops and vegetables are not deadly for the consumers alone. A government study has shown that they take a heavy toll on the farmers as well.

 An experiment carried out by the agriculture department on farmers in North 24-Parganas has revealed that handling fertilisers containing nitrogen, phosphorus and calcium, and eating food prepared from crops and vegetables fed with these, affect blood pressure, the liver and lungs. A type of paralysis might also set in with time.

 District agriculture development officer S. Bhattacharya said farmers mostly use chemical fertilisers. Our pilot study at Amdanga and Jagulia was taken up to find out the chemicals effects on the farmers, he added.

 He said that a farmer on an average uses 150 kg of chemical fertilisers a year on a hectare of land. We selected 50 farmers and divided them into two groups. While one group used chemical fertilisers at Amdanga, the other in Jagulia grew brinjal and potato with conventional, non-chemical fertilisers. At the outset, all of them underwent medical examinations. Their blood pressure as well as liver, kidney and lung functioning was recorded, said G. Mukherjee, a pathologist associated with the project and a cancer research centre at Barasat

 After five months, the farmers underwent a second round of medical tests, where it was found that those using chemical fertilisers had experienced changes in their system.

 In all, 70 per cent of the farmers handling chemical fertilisers and eating the crops and vegetables grown on their land suffered from irritation in the eyes, persistent itching and fatigue. Some of them also had higher blood pressure and lung and liver problems, Mukherjee said.

 Thirteen farmers showed signs of paraesthesia, a disease where paralysis sets in slowly. They were also found to be more susceptible to neurological disorders, he added.

 According to Bhattacharya, one of the major reasons why farmers use chemical fertilisers is ignorance. We are now trying to promote fertiliser literacy among farmers to educate them about the ill-effects of chemical fertilisers and the benefits of using conventional and bio-fertilisers, he said.

 The effect of chemicals on the farmers was so telling because their levels of exposure were high and they lacked basic knowledge about how to protect themselves against their toxic effects. 

 These farmers also ate what they grew. By eating crops and vegetables grown on chemicals, we are all unknowingly exposing ourselves to the same risks, Bhattacharya said.

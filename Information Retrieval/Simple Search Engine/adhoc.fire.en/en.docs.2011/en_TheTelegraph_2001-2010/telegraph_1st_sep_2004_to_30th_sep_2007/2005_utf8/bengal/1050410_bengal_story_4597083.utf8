 Investor ?myths? ripped

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Calcutta, April 9: Don?t waste money on sops to investors. Use funds to improve industrial infrastructure. This is the essence of the advice that the Department for Industrial Development gave the state government after a study of the urban investment climate.

 Financial incentives are not the key factors in investment, concluded analysts after interacting with investors. ?At best, they have a marginal impact in attracting investment and are rarely the decisive or primary factor in a firm?s choice of location,? said the report of the British agency submitted to the government last week.

 The survey conducted by ICRA Management Consulting Services for DFID rated quality and availability of infrastructure more important than financial incentives, which the Study of Urban Investment Climate Issues in West Bengal said should be phased out.

 Those surveyed include heads of 25 medium and large industrial units in Calcutta, Uluberia, Haldia, Howrah, Kasba and industry associations.

 Commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen agreed that incentives are less important to investors than infrastructure. ?Investors are not guided by incentives alone. There are other strong motivators guiding business decisions,? Sen said.

 ?We chose to have a study on this as we wanted to see how effective our incentive schemes are. After studying the report, we will see how much of their advice we can implement,? he said.

 At present, the state offers a variety of sops to investors, losing out Rs 100 crore per annum in the process. The sops include capital and interest subsidy, refund of 50 per cent stamp duty and registration fee in land and building acquisition, waiver of electricity duty for the first five years of operation and additional subsidy for employment generation.

 The government has also said it may consider granting, under the West Bengal Incentive Scheme 2004, industrial promotion assistance for projects with investment of over Rs 25 crore and more sops for projects that are important for the overall development of the state and have an investment of over Rs 100 crore.

 DFID has advised the state to introduce an industrial policy with specific incentives for infrastructure, which should be available on equal terms to all investors, should be performance based and linked to actual investment.

 The agency suggested that the savings from reduced incentives be ploughed back by uniformly reducing taxes and improving infrastructure.

 It has urged the government to ensure an environment with uniform rules as part of improving the overall investment climate.

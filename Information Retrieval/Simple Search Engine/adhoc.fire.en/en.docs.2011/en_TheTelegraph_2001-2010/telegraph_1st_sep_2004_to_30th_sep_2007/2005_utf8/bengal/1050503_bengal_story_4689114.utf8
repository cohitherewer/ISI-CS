 Somen and Subrata call truce

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 2: Former state Congress president Somen Mitra today buried the hatchet with his one-time rival Subrata Mukherjee offering to share dais at a convention on May 8 organised by the mayor. 

 Days after floating the Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha, an alliance of ?secular? anti-Left parties, Mukherjee is lobbying with senior Congress leaders to make the University Institute Hall meet a success. 

 Mitra had crossed swords with Mukherjee on several occasions since the early 1970s over who wielded a greater clout in the Congress. The relations soured further as Mukherjee switched over to the Trinamul Congress five years ago. 

 ?Today I want to forget the past and instead welcome Subrata?s novel efforts to float a secular anti-CPM front to counter the communists in Bengal. Everybody should realise that such a forum could only emerge as an alternative to the CPM,? Mitra said tonight, adding: ?I also call upon Mamata (Banerjee) to quit the NDA and join this platform.?

 Mukherjee said he would formally invite Mitra to the convention tomorrow. ?It?s true that I had hurt Somen when I switched over to Mamata?s Trinamul. But today, time has come to seek his valued support and that of other Congress functionaries to make the grand alliance a success. I have realised that no single party can oust the CPM in Bengal,? said the mayor, who continues to be part of Trinamul in the absence of any disciplinary action.

 State CPM secretary Anil Biswas said Mukherjee has no ?moral authority? to continue as the mayor. The members of his council are at loggerheads with the mayor, added Biswas.

 Trinamul?s Pankaj Banerjee promised ?new faces? among its civic poll nominees.

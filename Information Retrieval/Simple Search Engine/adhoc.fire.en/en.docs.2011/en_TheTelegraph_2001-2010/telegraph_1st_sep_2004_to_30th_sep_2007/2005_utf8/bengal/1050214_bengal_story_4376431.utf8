 CPM stocks ammo for Delhi

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 13: At its state conference, the CPM sought to make it clear among delegates that foreign investment was necessary for Bengal?s development.

 But in Delhi, the party will oppose the Centre?s decision on foreign holding in telecom, defence and banking when the budget session begins.

 The issue came up for discussion at an emergency politburo meeting at the state party?s Alimuddin Street headquarters to discuss ?important aspects? of a political and organisational report to be placed at the six-day party congress beginning in Delhi on April 6. 

 Another four-day politburo and central committee meeting has been lined up in Delhi between March 17 and 20 to give final touches to the report before the congress. 

 ?We are opposed to foreign investment in such core sectors as telecom and defence, which are tied to the country?s security,? Jyoti Basu said tonight. The party would decide its course of movement on this score in consultation with other Left parties after the budget session begins, he added. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee could not attend today?s meeting as he was in north Bengal. Basu, who was there this morning, said the opposition to foreign investment in telecom and defence did not clash with ?our wooing foreign investment for Bengal?s development?. 

 ?We shall invite foreign investment only when it is necessary to uplift the lot of the poor,? he added.

 At the state party conference, the chief minister sought to explain to delegates that there was no contradiction between development and ?our pro-people policies?. He said: ?If we don?t have resources to set up new factories, there is no harm in inviting foreign investors.?

 Bhattacharjee?s observation came in the wake of stiff opposition to foreign investment in the state from a section of the party. Delegates from Calcutta, Howrah, Hooghly and North 24-Parganas had questioned the leadership about the apparent ?dichotomy?.

 Police grill headmistress tormentors 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Feb. 12: Police today interrogated several teachers and guardians of Barisha Vivekananda Balika Vidyalaya in connection with the gherao of headmistress Ila Samaddar in protest against harsh punishment to 12 students. 

 The students were made to stand in the sun for over an hour for tinkering with the headmistress? car. Three of them collapsed. 

 The headmistress was arrested yesterday on the basis of the complaint of a guardian. Police also held 15 persons, including some guardians, for attacking policemen when they came to lift the gherao. 

 All the accused were produced before the sub-divisional magistrate?s court at Alipore, where the acting SDJM released them on bail. 

 An uneasy calm prevailed on the school premises as police pickets remained. The management said classes would resume from Tuesday, a day after immersion of the Saraswati idol.

 Rama Bhattacharya, a senior teacher of the school, said on Saturday night that it would take a few more days to restore normalcy. 

 Superintendent of police, S..Gupta said officials are probing the matter. ?We shall interrogate some more teachers and students in connection with the incident,? he added.

 Meanwhile, locals alleged that the headmistress is in the habit of punishing school children on minor excuses.

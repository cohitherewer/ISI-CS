 Doors open to quota students

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 6: The health department today decided to admit in this years MBBS course, 65 students who enrolled last year under the NRI quota but had to make way for those featuring on the Joint Entrance Examination merit list.

 As the JEE 2005 results were declared today, senior health department officials went into a huddle to decide the fate of the 65 students.

 The Supreme Court had directed that the NRI quota students, who got admission to the course after paying an enhanced fee of nearly Rs 9 lakh, will have to be accommodated this year.

 There is no question of violating court guidelines. We will implement it completely and the students will, hopefully, start classes this season, C.R. Maiti, director of medical education told The Telegraph after the marathon meeting.

 A total of 1,105 seats are on offer in nine medical colleges, which includes 57 per cent for general candidates, 22 per cent for Scheduled Castes, 6 per cent for Scheduled Tribes, 15 per cent for CBSE candidates and 3 per cent for the physically challenged. In addition, 10 to 15 seats are reserved for royal families.

 The government will start the counselling session for the 65 first and then take up the task for the remaining 1,040 seats. The dates have yet to be finalised but an official said the process is likely to be completed by the end of this month.

 The 65 students were barred from attending first year MBBS classes by Calcutta High Court and then by the Supreme Court after it was revealed that the government had violated regulations while admitting them.

 To accommodate these 65 students, the government will now have to exclude the same number of students from this years merit list.

 Asked what will happen to such candidates, Maiti said the government had no choice but to follow the apex courts guidelines. 

 A health department official said there is every possibility that the students who will be left out despite making it to the merit list this year will again drag the government to court. It appears that they will also go to court, but there is little for us to do, an official said.

 The delighted quota students will call on Maiti. We are happy that we will finally be able to study medicine. We might have lost a year, but now is the time to rejoice, said one of them.

 Great Eastern Hotel: Awaiting a new turn

 Calcutta, Feb. 18: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s government today officially set the ball rolling for the early retirement of 400-odd employees of Great Eastern Hotel by announcing that a notice will be served in a week. 

 A meeting at Writers? Buildings, attended by officials from the Great Eastern Hotel Authority, cleared the decision on the early retirement scheme (ERS). T.K. Burman, the principal secretary of the tourism department and chairman of the hotel authority, Jagannath Bag, its chief executive, and M.K. Sengupta, the tourism director, were among those who attended the meeting. 

 Minutes after it concluded, Bag said: ?As chief executive of the hotel, I will issue the notification within a week asking all workers to opt for the scheme.?

 After this, the 378 regular and 60 contractual employees of the hotel are ?virtually left with no option?, a senior official said at Writers?. 

 All the employees have to apply for the scheme within a month of the issue of the notice. However, that does not necessarily mean that they will have only one more month to work. ?The government has still not finalised the date from when the hotel would be handed over for restructuring,? said an official.

 Unable to run the over-a-century-old hotel profitably, the government advertised in dailies a few months ago inviting expressions of interest from private firms. 

 Earlier, Burman met representatives of unions affiliated to both Intuc and the Citu. The CPM-backed union wanted the hotel to be restructured and renovated. Its leaders stressed that ?we are qualified to work when the hotel is restructured?. The Congress-backed Intuc asked for more talks and a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) instead of the ERS. 

 Burman said: ?We heard what they had to say. But the issue has been discussed several times with the unions and it is not that they were kept in the dark. There is no scope for further dialogue. The ERS would be adopted immediately.?

 However, the government did not clarify what it would do with those who do not apply for the ERS. The British Department for International Development (DFID) will fund the scheme.

 Union leaders held several meetings today with ?aggrieved? members to discuss our course of action. ?We are not going to accept the scheme. Will anybody accept a paltry sum ranging between Rs 3 and 4 lakh after working for over 25 years?? asked Pijush Roychowdhury, secretary of the Citu-affiliated union.

 Adult wanted, child held

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chinsurah, Oct. 29: Unable to get Mantu Kabiraj, wanted in connection with a robbery, police allegedly picked up his 10-year-old son Raja on Thursday and kept him in a lock-up.

 The boy was released later this evening.

 I saw Raja in the lock-up along with criminals when I went to the Singur police station yesterday. When I argued that Raja should not be arrested in the absence of his father and lodged in the lock-up, the police turned a deaf ear, said Rajas aunt Ujjala.

 Recounting Thursday nights events, she said police raided her flat in Lichubagan at Bandel, about 70 km from Calcutta, around 11 pm. The policemen barged into my house and asked for my brother, Mantu. When I denied any knowledge about him, they woke up Raja and forcibly took him away.

 While Mantu, a grocer, has been absconding since the robbery in July, Raja, a student of Class V in Lichubagan Primary School, is being looked after by his aunt since his mother died four years ago.

 Ujjala was shocked when she visited the police station this morning and did not find Raja in the lock-up. When I asked about Rajas whereabouts, the policemen turned us away. I wanted Raja to return home as he was supposed to sit for an examination today.

 Later tonight, the officer-in-charge of Singur police station said Raja was released around 8.30 pm and handed over to his relatives.

 After returning home, Raja told reporters that he was tortured by police kakus. They (the police) abused me and twisted my hands several times to know about my fathers hideouts.

 Though subdivisional police officer Sujoy Chanda refused to divulge whether Raja was arrested, he said police could take a near one of the accused into custody if the latter is not available at the time of a raid.

 The Sunderbans: Calling for help

Calcutta, March 8: When a storm lashes coastal Bengal, the shores are often spared, thanks to the Sunderbans. 

 But of the 130 types of plants that used to adorn the mangrove forest, there are only 63 now. The sundari, which gives the Sunderbans its name, and golpata, which used to grow in abundance, are fast dwindling. 

 The mangrove forests need urgent help ? not just from the government, but whoever has anything to offer, land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said today. 

 The government has decided to sow mangrove plants in many places, said Mollah. ?If we do not collectively save the forests, none of us even in Calcutta would survive long?The danger is manifold.? 

 Apart from the trees that make a mangrove forest, the government is also helping villagers in the riverine Sunderbans cultivate crops. ?There is an urgent need to develop the economy of the area and to help in the all-round development of the place,? the minister said.

 Awareness as well as a secure livelihood is essential for bringing down felling of trees.

 Sunderbans affairs minister Kanti Ganguly said there cannot be any activity in the area but plantation. To save the Sunderbans, the government may look for funds from international organisations like the World Bank, ?or launch a website?, added Ganguly. 

 A Planning Commission team will be in the city tomorrow, responding to a Rs 300-crore proposal for the well being of the forest.

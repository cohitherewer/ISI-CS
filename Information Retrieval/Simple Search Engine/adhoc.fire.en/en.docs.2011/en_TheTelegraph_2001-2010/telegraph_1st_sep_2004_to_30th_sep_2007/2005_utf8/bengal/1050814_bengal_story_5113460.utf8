 Green scheme for canal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 time for a facelift

 Calcutta, Aug. 13: From an eye sore to a sight for sore eyes. 

 That could be the course the Beliaghata canal takes if the state government can make its green scheme a success.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will on Monday flag off the project, in which the green brush will work along with the broom. 

 So, apart from planting a variety of trees and erecting a fence along the canal, garbage vats on both sides of the water body will be demolished and the filth removed.

 Three government departments, including irrigation and forest and environment, have joined hands with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation to steer the Rs 73-lakh project. 

 The irrigation department has recently dredged the canal to increase the flow of water. According to the plan, the environment department as well as the West Bengal Pollution Control Board will provide the funds, the forest department will take care of planting trees and the CMC will see to it that the project is implemented in three months.

 The forest department has collected some special varieties of trees to be planted on both sides of the canal ? they are fast-growing and hairy with large leaves that can absorb dust, smoke and heat. This apart, several fruit trees will be planted.

 The banks of the canal have been in a sorry state for some time with encroachments and garbage dumps dotting the 18-km-stretch. Although the CMDA has widened the road along the canal and removed slums, some parts are still occupied. 

 Officials said all encroachers would be cleared out while the project is on. 

 It is part of our exercise to improve the environment in the city. We will take up similar projects along the other canals also. We have already taken up a number of steps to make the city more green, more clean and more eco-friendly. Though CMC has taken the initiatives for a greener Calcutta, for the canal we have sought assistance from different government departments and environmentalists, said mayor Bikash Bhattacharya. 

 We will plant trees along roads, canals, parks, gardens, traffic islands, road dividers and open spaces available. We have already started identifying spots for planting trees. The CMC will involve NGOs, other groups, clubs and people from all walks of life in implementing the schemes, the mayor said. 

 He added that local residents would be roped in the exercise to protect trees and prevent people from polluting the areas.

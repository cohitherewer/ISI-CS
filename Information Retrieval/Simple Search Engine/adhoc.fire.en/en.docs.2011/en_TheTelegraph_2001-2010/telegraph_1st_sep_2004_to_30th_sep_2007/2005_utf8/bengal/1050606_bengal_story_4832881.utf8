 Father cries kidnap, cops affair

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, June 5: Rozi Khatun, a Class XII student, is missing since yesterday.

 The father of the 17-year-old girl ? a resident of Jadupur Gabgachi ? said he has received a ransom call, but police are not buying that. They are not sure if she had been kidnapped. 

 Sheikh Mannan, a trader, said his daughter was picked up on her way back from school. Last night, someone called and demanded Rs 1 lakh for her release. He asked me to take the money to a mango orchard near Madhabnagar and threatened saying Rozi would be harmed if the police were called, the father of five daughters and two sons said. But he went to the police last night. 

 Tension mounted after the police returned empty handed from the spot where the ransom had to be paid. No phone calls were reported after that.

 Today, Mannan, a CPM supporter, went to food processing minister Sailen Sarkars house seeking help for the rescue of his second daughter. Sarkar later said: I have told the police to speed up investigation. However, they are yet to establish whether it is a case of kidnapping. 

 District police chief S.K. Poojari said: She was having an affair. We are interrogating some of her friends. We do not think that this is kidnapping.

 Mannan had contested the 1969, 1972 and 1977 Assembly polls as an Independent. He never won. Last time, Sarkar was among his opponents.

 Suicide after rap for poor result

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 31: Mintu Pal, a Class IX student who wanted to be a cricketer, killed himself last night after his father refused to sign on his report card because he fared poorly.

 He received the marksheet about a month ago and kept it to himself. Nripen Biswas, the headmaster of Kalipur High School at Bhatjangla, about 100 km from Calcutta, had asked Mintu repeatedly to get the paper signed by his guardian. He did not do so.

 Having failed in English and mathematics, Mintu, 15, was scared to confront his father, Dhiren Biswas, a hosiery trader in Krishnagar. 

 Yesterday, the headmaster received report cards signed by parents of all students except Mintu?s. They were summoned. Nripen Biswas said: ?I was very angry with Mintu. I handed him a letter asking his parents to meet me.?

 Last evening, Mintu timidly approached his father with the report card. He did not show him the headmaster?s letter. Seeing the marks, Dhiren was furious. 

 ?He got poor marks in each and every subject. I had cautioned him before the examination and asked him to concentrate on studies. But he was always engrossed in cricket. His aim in life was to be a cricketer,? said Dhiren, who refused to sign on the report card. 

 Last night, Mintu refused dinner and locked himself in his room.

 In the morning, after Mintu did not open the door despite repeated knocks by his mother, neighbours were called in. 

 ?When they broke it open, Mintu was hanging from the ceiling. He had used his mother?s sari to hang himself,? said Biswarup Ghosh, an additional superintendent of police.

 Dhiren said: ?I rebuked him for the poor marks and asked him to get the report card signed by his mother. My wife, too, refused to sign... He died because of me.?

 CM plays progress card

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Sept. 25: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today sought to refurbish the development credentials of his government in north Bengal, addressing an issue that has been blamed for the unrest in the region.

 Amra chai kaj, kaj kaj! Aar ora shudhu golmal, golmal golmal (We want work and more work, but the Opposition wants trouble and more trouble), Bhattacharjee told a public meeting here. 

 He asked the people of north Bengal to foil the designs of certain parties to divide the people and disturb peace.

 The chief ministers overdrive came close on the heels of a confrontation over the demand to create a Greater Cooch Behar state.

 The Opposition and some allies of the Left Front have been suggesting that lack of development is the main reason behind the disturbances in the region. 

 Addressing the meeting organised by the CPMs Darjeeling district committee, the chief minister said that while his government was trying to put north Bengal on the path of development, these elements were misleading the people in an effort to impede progress in the region. 

 Siliguri has become the best city in the north, he said.

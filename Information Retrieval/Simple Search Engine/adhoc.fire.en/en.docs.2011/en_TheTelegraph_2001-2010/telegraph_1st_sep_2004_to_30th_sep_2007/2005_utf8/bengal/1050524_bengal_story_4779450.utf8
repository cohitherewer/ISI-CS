 Rahul, rallys star hope 

 Calcutta, May 23: Rahul Gandhi could be the star of the show in a rally ahead of the city civic polls if only state Congress leader Pradip Bhattacharyas wish holds good, says our special correspondent.

 The United Democratic Alliance ? the coalition of the Congress and mayor Subrata Mukherjees forum of non-Left outfits ? has lined up three rallies in city for the June 19 polls. Defence minister and state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee, Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh and Nationalist Congress Partys P.A. Sangma will address the meetings at Sealdah, Shyambazar and Hazra. We are also trying to bring (Rahul) Gandhi, said Bhattacharya, the state Congress working president.

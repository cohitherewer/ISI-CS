 Match made under scanner

 RABI BANERJEE

 Krishnagar, Nov. 23: With the rising number of cases of Bangladeshi youths luring girls into marriage and deserting them soon after, villagers near the border in Nadia district have launched an awareness campaign and made it mandatory for prospective grooms to furnish proof of identity.

 Since Durga Puja this year, five cases have been reported from villages under Digolkandi panchayat in Murutia, 190 km from Calcutta, where youths from across the border have tied the knot with local girls and disappeared.

 Official estimates put the number at 500 in the last two years.

 This is a new trend in the border areas of the district. We will take an initiative to help villagers spread awareness, said additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh.

 Suparna Ghosh, a 19-year-old from Tarakgunj, fell in love with a youth who identified himself as Soumen Sarkar and said he worked in a senior position with a private company in Calcutta. She forced her unsuspecting farmer father Sunil Ghosh to give his nod.

 But Sunils friends smelt a rat while talking to the youth a day before the wedding last week. During the conversation, some of my friends noticed a Bangladeshi accent and caught him making contradictory statements about his background. When they started grilling him, the youth broke down and confessed he was actually Mohammad Asraful Sheikh from Kushtia in Bangladesh. We gave him a good thrashing and drove him out of the village, said Sunil.

 But 15-year-old Dipali Sarkar of Rangapur was not so lucky. The Class IX student had eloped with a youth last month, who left her behind in a hotel and fled. 

 Members of the Digolkandi panchayat, which includes 15 villages, held a meeting last week and decided that all prospective grooms would be scrutinised. We have decided to make villagers aware about the menace (by making announcements) over loudspeakers. All grooms will have to furnish their voter identity cards, ration cards and other identity papers before a match is made, said panchayat pradhan Kartick Mondal.

 The principal staff officer of the Border Security Force in Calcutta, R.C. Saxena, said: We are ready to help the local administration carry out the awareness campaign to stop this menace. We have already sent orders to the outposts.

 Custody death

 Calcutta, Aug. 17: The state governments efforts to stop the CBI from probing a custodial death in West Midnapore district hit a wall today with Calcutta High Court refusing to accept its petition for a stay on the investigation. 

 The high court had directed the CBI to probe the death of Soumendu Mondal, a resident of Debra. Advocate-general Balai Ray, appearing for the government, today prayed for a stay on exercising the order till the disposal of the case.

 Soumendu, 22, was allegedly picked up from his home on July 7, 2004 by Kharagpur police. The police had told the court that he was killed when he tried to flee from the jeep on the way to the police station. But the post-mortem report did not corroborate this claim.

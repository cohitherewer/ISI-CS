 Hunt on for medical education director

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 24: If you are a health service doctor with a post-graduate degree and have experience as a medical teacher and administrator, you can apply for the post of the director of medical education. 

 The government has invited applications from all ? professors and officers of joint secretary rank to medical college principals and hospital superintendents ? for the post. 

 This is the first time that the selection has been thrown open to make way for the maximum number of applications from candidates who can boast of a fair mix of academic expertise and administrative prowess. Earlier, it was a closed affair with the government picking the right candidate from its own shortlist. 

 A senior health department officer said: Each candidate would be assessed on academic qualifications, research, training received and publications one has to his or her credit. Besides, emphasis would also be laid on experience and self-appraisal.

 The last date for application is July 29, following which the shortlisting would begin. Two days later, the current director of medical education, C.R. Maity, would move over as a member of the Public Service Commission. 

 Although, officially the post is open to all, insiders in the health department said the government has set its eyes on two candidates. 

 The choice, they claimed, is between Soumendra Nath Banerjee, the health department special secretary overseeing medical education, research and training, and Jayshree Mitra, the Medical College and Hospital principal. Both are known to be close to the CPM.

 Banerjee, who had served as principal of Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, is senior to Mitra in profession. He is the one now spearheading reforms in medical education and training. 

 But health sources said the scale is tilted towards Mitra, who is also the acting director of the School of Tropical Medicine and has been running medical colleges since 1993.

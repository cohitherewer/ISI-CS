 Army boss in east sees KLO threat

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Jan. 3: The topmost army officer in eastern India today said the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation remains a cause for concern in north Bengal, particularly for its links with the Maoists in Nepal. 

 Lt Gen. Arvind Sharma, the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (Eastern Command), said: ?Their leadership is still intact, though the membership may be dwindling. We don?t rule out their interaction with the Maoists in Nepal. This nexus portends an ominous future.?

 Sharma, who was chosen to head Eastern Command ? one of the most difficult because of the terrain and problems that besiege the region ? because of his experience and familiarity with the east, declined comment on intelligence reports regarding militants using the city for transit. 

 ?West Bengal has not been declared a disturbed area but, even then, the state government will do well to look into this aspect. We are in constant touch with the state government on this,? he said.

 As the GOC-in-C (Eastern Command), Sharma holds responsibility of the seven sisters of the Northeast besides Bengal and its adjoining districts in Bihar. 

 Officials said Sharma was being groomed for the post over the past six months and was selected following recommendations from the army chief and the defence minister. 

 Defence observers said this is the only recent instance in which the chief of staff, Eastern Command, has been promoted straight to the post of GOC-in-C. 

 On charges of molestation by army personnel from some states in the Northeast, the officer who has also served Manipur as divisional commander said such incidents occur. ?In a large army like ours, such incidents may occur? But we also ensure that those who are at fault are punished,? Sharma said. 

 Earlier an instructor at the National Defence Academy and the Defence Services Staff College, Sharma, who replaced Lt Gen. J.S. Verma at the helm of the Eastern Command on January 1, will have to tackle several problems, including insurgency in the Northeast, the KLO in north Bengal and infiltration across the Nepal and Bhutan borders. 

 Recruitment centre

 A new army recruitment centre would be opened in Behrampore, about 200 km from Calcutta. An army officer, Colonel Urbinder Singh, was in the town today to select a plot for the centre. Months ago, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, an MP from Jalangi in the district, had made the promise to local people.

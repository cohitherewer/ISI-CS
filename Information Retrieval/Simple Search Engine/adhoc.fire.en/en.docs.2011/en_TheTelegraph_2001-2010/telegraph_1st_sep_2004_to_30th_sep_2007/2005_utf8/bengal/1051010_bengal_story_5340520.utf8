 BRIEFS

 Burdwan/Chinsurah, Oct. 9: Seven workers of a brick kiln were killed this morning when a 40-foot stack of bricks collapsed on them in Balagarh, Hooghly.

 Three workers, who are said to be in critical condition, have been admitted to the subdivisional hospital at Kalna in neighbouring Burdwan. Satya Pal, the owner of the brick kiln at Guptipara, about 110 km from Calcutta, and over a dozen workers are absconding. The accident occurred around 8 am when the workers were taking out fresh bricks. Five of them were declared brought dead in the hospital. Two others died later. There were about 22 workers at the kiln ? all of them from Ranchi. By sheer providence a dozen of them escaped unhurt, said a local resident. Hooghly additional superintendent Asit Pal said a probe has been ordered.

 Calcutta: Two people were killed and eight, including two children, were injured when a Tata Sumo hit a truck here in Birbhum. Police said it was carrying 10 tourists from Tarapith to Calcutta when it met with the accident, about 260 km from the city, while trying to overtake a bus. The unidentified driver and Rakesh Pal, 36, were killed. The condition of two women is said to be serious.

 Calcutta: Trains on the Howrah-Burdwan main line were disrupted for about an hour and a half on Sunday because of an agitation at the Baidyabati level crossing in Hooghly. Around 6 pm, residents of the area, 40 km from Calcutta, blocked tracks protesting against a power cut since 11 pm on Saturday.

 Midnapore: The health department is probing allegations of corruption against four employees, including a doctor, of Egra Block Primary Health Centre. East Midnapore chief medical officer Subrata Gupta said a preliminary probe has found them guilty of siphoning out medicines.

 Howrah: A pandal in Jagachha caught fire after lightning struck two of its domes during a thundershower. The blaze gutted the domes of the pandal, made after a Malaysian temple. They will be rebuilt and the Puja held as usual, said the organisers.

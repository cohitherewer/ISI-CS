 Accused in custody 

Nabadwip, Sept. 2: On the day of his daughter?s rice-eating ceremony, Tapas Karmakar was arrested for allegedly raping his 10-year-old niece here in Nadia.

 The inspector-in-charge of Nabadwip police station, Amitava Ghosh, said the girl?s family had been invited to Karmakar?s house at Bakultala, about 100 km from Calcutta, on the occasion of his year-old daughter?s mukhebhat (the first rice eating).

 Karmakar, a weaver who earns a decent living, went to his relative?s place in the same locality long before the ceremony was to start and brought the girl to his house. 

 He told her father Dipak, his cousin, that she will help his family members in managing the ceremony. 

 Dipak, a carpenter-cum-painter, and other members of his family did not at all mind sending the girl with her uncle.

 Once at his house, Karmakar told the Class V student of Nabadwip Bakultala Girls? High School to rest in a room and bolted the door from outside. He came back some time later and raped the girl, the police said. 

 Uttam Karmakar, also an uncle of the girl, said they could not trace her while planning to return home after the ceremony. ?We panicked as we thought that she might have been kidnapped. I began to search the rooms and found one locked from outside. On entering this room, I found my niece weeping. When I asked why, she began sobbing and then narrated the incident,? he told the police.

 It was Uttam who lodged the complaint with the Nabadwip police station and took the girl to Pratapnagar Block Hospital for medical examination. 

 When the police swooped on Karmakar?s house, he was crying ? in the same room where he committed the crime. Uttam, who helps Dipak run his neighbourhood carpenter?s shop, said: ?I really could not believe my ears when my niece narrated to me her horror story. I was so shocked and perplexed that initially I did not know what to do.?

 Karmakar reportedly confessed to his crime.

 The girl?s mother, Sandhya, cannot forgive the ?beast? in her brother-in-law. ?How could he do it? I still cannot believe what I heard.?

 Nabadwip has witnessed at least three incidents in the past three months in which girl children were raped (see box).

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: Sreya Basu, 11, who was suffering from dengue, died in a nursing home here this afternoon.

 Biswanath Bhattacharya, a doctor at the Lansdowne nursing home, said the girl from Chakraberia was admitted last Monday. She had dengue with complications like septicaemia, which led to a multi-organ failure, he said. 

 Santiniketan: Visva-Bharati registrar Sunil Kumar Sarkar was gheraoed in his office till around 12.30 on Sunday night for having asked hostel residents to vacate it after classes were suspended on Friday. Supporters of Chhatra Sammilani, a union controlled by the Congress student wing Chhatra Parishad, let Sarkar go after he went back on his order. Three union members had earlier been held for beating up an SFI leader.

 Krishnagar: A Calcu-tta police constable has been arrested for alleged bigamy. Ahmed Ali had married Firdousi Bibi, 22, of Kaligunj in Nadia, 140 km from Calcutta, and then another woman in the city two years ago. When her complaints to Nadia police fell on deaf ears, Firdousi wrote to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, also the police minister, in June. Instructed by his office, the police picked up Ali from his quarters at Alipore.

 Behrampore: Angura Bibi and her son Ayub Sheikh were arrested on Sunday for kidnapping a 13-year-old girl from their village at Kandi in Murshidabad and selling her to a man in Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh. Police said Durjahan Khatun was abducted a month ago. She fled Aligarh and reached home, some 240 km from Calcutta, with help from railway police.

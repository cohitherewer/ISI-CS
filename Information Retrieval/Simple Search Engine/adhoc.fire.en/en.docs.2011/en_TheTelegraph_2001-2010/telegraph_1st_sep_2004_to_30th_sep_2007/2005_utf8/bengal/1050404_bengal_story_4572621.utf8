 BRIEFS

 Midnapore, April 3: Residents of a poverty-stricken pocket of West Midnapore today virtually gheraoed the minister of state in charge of their welfare, Maheswar Murmu, and Left Front chairman Biman Bose?s convoy at Kankrajhore.

 They were returning from the impoverished Amlashol, 200 km from Calcutta,where six people have allegedly died of starvation since last June. The villagers demanded a high school and hospital and complained to Murmu that despite assurances during his last visit, nothing had been done. ?We are living the same miserable life ? no jobs, no healthcare,? said Ranjit Mura. Bose and the minister were accompanied by several district CPM leaders today. 

 Burdwan: Kajal Garai, 21, who hacked to death mother Bela Rani in February last year, tried to kill his younger brother Rajendra on Sunday at Simnor village in Galsi, about 160 km from Calcutta. He was arrested. Police said Kajal had killed his mother as he believed that she loved his brother more. The court had released him on bail and his father was asked to have him treated for his mental condition. Kajal was being treated at the psychiatry department of Burdwan Medical College and Hospital since then.

 Expelled boys in kidnap

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 5: Boys thrown out of school earlier apparently kidnapped Snehamoy Saha, a Class V student, from his hostel in a Ranaghat institution yesterday. 

 We have almost caught up with the gang, but we will need some more time to find out where exactly they have kept Snehamoy, additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh said. 

 The boy, whose father Sanatan is a prosperous farmer-cum-trader in Bangladesh, was abducted from Ramakrishna-Sarada Mission Vidyapith, 65 km from Calcutta, around 4 am yesterday. 

 The kidnappers ? the police said they were aged between 16 and 18 ? sneaked into the hostel by scaling the boundary wall as the guard had dozed off in his room. 

 When they knocked on the hostel door, some students answered the call. Once in, the gang asked for Snehamoy and forced him out.

 Ghosh said: These boys had been expelled from Ramakrishna-Sarada Mission Vidyapith as they had fallen into bad company and were accused of anti-social activities. Their gang leader is said to have passed Madhyamik only this year.

 Questioning Snehamoys roommates, the police came to know that the kidnappers were all former students of the school who had even stayed at the hostel. A police officer said: The boys probably wanted to grab some quick money. We can only hope they have not harmed the boy.

 Calls for ransom made to the house of his local guardian, Patit Paban Chakraborty ? a resident of Kalyani, 15 km from Ranaghat ? were traced to a public booth in Dhantola. 

 The abductors called Chakrabortys house thrice and asked for money, but did not specify the amount. They sought the boys fathers contact number repeatedly and also made him talk to his relatives, Ghosh said. 

 Around 9 am yesterday, Chakraborty, a businessman, got the first phone call. Two similar calls came twice later. There was no specific demand for ransom in any of them. 

 The police said Snehamoy and his father Sanatan were in the state with valid passport and other papers. Sanatan, who trades in agricultural items like fertilisers, frequently crosses the border and stays with a relative in Jalpaiguri.

 Undertrials give cops the slip

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 8: Six undertrials slipped out of Mayukh Bhavan, which houses the Salt Lake sub-divisional magistrates court, as they were about to board a prison van this afternoon.

 After a chase, the police caught hold of four of them.

 A hunt is on for the rest. All the adjoining police stations have been alerted and entry and exit points of Salt Lake are being watched, said Praveen Kumar, the superintendent of police, North 24-Parganas.

 He has ordered a probe into what the policemen guarding the undertrials were doing when the six ? three of them are accused in a rape and robbery case in Salt Lake five months ago ? escaped.

 The incident took place around 5.30 pm when Rabiul Laskar, Ziaul Laskar, Hasan Laskar, Pintu Rai, Sahidul Mandal and Tinku Rai were being taken out of the court lock-up on the second-floor of Mayukh Bhavan. 

 They had queued up with other undertrials to board the prison van that would take them to the Barrackpore sub-divisional jail. A scuffle broke out and the six took advantage of the chaos to run out, the police said. 

 Some guards noticed two of the convicts posing as customers at a bhelpuri stall. A little later, Pintu and Ziaul were tracked down to a nearby apartment.

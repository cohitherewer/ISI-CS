 JEE must for more students

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 11: Students seeking admission to courses in alternative branches of medicine ? homeopathy, ayurveda and unani ? or physiotherapy and nursing will have to write the joint entrance examination (JEE) from next year. 

 Till 2005, students were admitted to three courses through the JEE ? MBBS, taught in the states eight undergraduate medical colleges, bachelors in dental surgery (BDS), offered by four dental colleges, and bachelors in engineering (BE), taught in about 70 engineering and technology schools.

 The new move is aimed at ensuring qualitative improvement of all courses concerning medical sciences, said M.M. Choudhury, the vice-chancellor of West Bengal University of Health Sciences.

 Separate entrance tests were so long held for those aspiring to study in homeopathy, ayurveda or unani medical colleges while admission to BSc (nursing) courses was granted on the basis of marks obtained in their Plus II examinations.

 For medical and related courses, tests would be held in physics, chemistry and biology. Those seeking admission in engineering and technology colleges will have to take physics, chemistry and mathematics tests. 

 A JEE official said the common test will ensure high academic standards. Till last year, the screening tests for the other courses were different and of much inferior standard. As they are becoming as popular as MBBS or BDS, there is an urgent need to upgrade the standard of screening tests.

 Dibyendu Kar, a senior official of the JEE board, said: Apart from the fact that we will be able to increase participation of better performers, the new system will ease the admission process. 

 This year, 62,000 students appeared in the JEE. The number will go up to about a lakh in 2006. The exam is scheduled to be held on April 22 and 23 and forms will be distributed from November 14.

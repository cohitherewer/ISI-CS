 Poll panel signal for officers transfer

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 20: The Election Commission has asked the Bengal government to transfer administrative and police officers serving for three years or more in the same district. 

 Earlier, officials holding posts in the same district for four years or more were transferred before elections.

 Administrative personnel from district magistrates to block development officers and police officers from inspector-general to sub-inspectors would come under the sweep of the order.

 Trinamul Congress MLA Pankaj Banerjee, also the lea-der of the Opposition, welcomed the poll panels directive. It is a step in the right direction. The CPM used to keep its pet officials in the same district year after year. This will stop, he said.

 But a section in his party feels the order will not make much of a difference. What the EC (Election Commission) should ensure is that a government officer who has served in a district during Lok Sabha elections (2004) is not allowed to handle the Assembly polls, said Saugata Roy, also a Trinamul MLA.

 Chief electoral officer Debasish Sen met home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy, city police commissioner Prasun Mukherjee and state director-general of police S.C. Avasthy during the day to discuss the transfers. They will have to be carried out with immediate effect as it will take time for new-comers to familiarise themselves with their fresh assignments, Sen said. 

 He pointed out that during earlier polls some transferred officers avoided duty on one pretext or the other. 

 In most cases, they go on leave for several months by reporting sick. This time, the government would have to ensure that the transfers are actually carried out. A preliminary report on the matter will have to be submitted to the poll panel on January 20. 

 Sen said he would clarify during a visit to Delhi on Fri- day whether only those sub-inspectors who are functioning as police station officers-in-charge will come under the scope of the directive.

 Asked whether next years Bengal polls would be held on a single day or phases, Sen said: It will depend on the availability of security forces.

 Mamata Banerjee today demanded that the commission take over control of the states administration during the Assembly elections. 

 The Trinamul Congress chief also wants the poll panel observers report on the last Lok Sabha polls in Bengal made public. He (observer Afzal Amanullah) had pointed out in his report that the elections were not fair in Bengal. Actually, only 12 to 15 per cent votes were polled, the rest was rigged, Mamata said.

 Basu leads assault on Centre

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 13: Jyoti Basu today came down on the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance for its failure to implement the common minimum programme. 

 ?We have every right to criticise Manmohan Singh?s government if it does not strictly adhere to the CMP (the common minimum programme),? Basu told a convention on the ?right to work? organised by Citu, the CPM?s labour arm, at Salt Lake stadium.

 He said workers cannot forsake their right to strike work despite court strictures against it. ?We cannot give up the right to strike since this is the last weapon left with us to press for our demands.?

 Basu?s observation assumes significance in the wake of Citu president M.K. Pandhe?s announcement that the Left parties and trade unions would call a general strike against the central government. 

 However, differences have cropped up between the Citu and the Aituc ? the CPI?s labour arm ? over the proposed general strike. 

 It was evident yesterday when Gurudas Dasgupta, the CPI MP and Aituc?s all-India general secretary, said Pandhe should not have announced plans for a strike against the central government without speaking to the other Left parties and trade unions. 

 ?Pandhe should not have revealed the Left strategy before discussing the issue with other parties and trade unions,? Dasgupta said on the sidelines of a women?s convention organised the Aituc. 

 Dasgupta said Aituc and Citu leaders had held several rounds of discussions on the course of their anti-Centre agitation and probable dates for the bandh. ?However, a final decision on this score has to be taken only after a full-fledged discussion with Left parties and unions. We don?t like to impose the strike on other trade union bodies,? he added. 

 Dasgupta today said the Left parties would vote against the proposed pension bill in the budget session of Parliament if it is tabled in its present form. The bill is aimed at putting a lid on the government?s ballooning pension expenses. 

 ?We will not hesitate to clash with the central government both inside and outside Parliament,? Dasgupta said.

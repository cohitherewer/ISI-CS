 Magistrate faces bail probe

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 23: The high court today ordered an inquiry into a subdivisional judicial magistrates granting of bail to a man accused of raping his six months pregnant daughter-in-law. 

 In his order, Justice P.N. Sinha also directed the registrar (judicial) of the court to direct the North 24-Parganas sessions judge to initiate action against the Basirhat court magistrate, Mohammed N.H. Molla, if he is found wrong prima facie.

 On April 14, the 27-year-old housewife of Minakhan village lodged a police complaint alleging that her father-in-law, Arabinda Pramanik, 62, had raped her when her husband was away.

 Pramanik, a retired employee of the village husking mill, was picked up the next day. On April 16, he was produced before Molla. 

 On the first day of hearing, the magistrate rejected the bail prayer. But, from the day after, Pramanik made several petitions within a week and Molla heard all of them. Finally, on April 26, he granted the bail. 

 According to the Criminal Procedure Code, an arrested person cannot pray for bail in the subdivisional judicial magistrates court within seven days of rejection of a similar petition. 

 The alleged victim then moved a petition before the district sessions judge in Barasat seeking cancellation of the bail of her father-in-law. After going through the case records, the judge cancelled the bail granted by Molla.

 However, challenging the validity of the sessions jud- ges order, Pramanik moved a petition before the high court. Kallol Basu, his counsel, told the court today that Molla had bailed him out after coming to know that he was a cancer patient.

 The lawyer on behalf of the housewife, Puspal Satpathi, pointed out that she was carrying when raped. It is a heinous crime. The police had rightly taken prompt action... but the magistrate did not exercise his power in the right direction. He had no authority to entertain so many petitions by a same person within a week, he said.

 Molla, Satpathi added, had been accused of over-stepping rights earlier as well.

 Justice Sinha upheld the order of the sessions judge, who had directed the police to take Pramanik into custody again.

 Guardians lock up school

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 15: The fate of 500 students in South 24-Parganas has become uncertain as guardians have locked up the school gates protesting against the decision to abolish classes IX and X.

 Jamtala Junior High School in Kulpi, 70 km from here, was shut over the past week as the guardians prevented students and teachers from entering the premises. 

 The school has affiliation up to Class VIII. About a decade ago, the authorities, however, started classes IX and X following guardians requests. 

 But approval from the secondary board never came and in the absence of government funds, the management decided to discontinue the classes. Five temporary teachers have also been sacked. 

 The school authorities have sought the district administrations intervention, but an end to the impasse appeared distant. District inspector of schools (secondary) Sanghamitra Makur said an officer will probe how the school opened the classes without approval. 

 My son is in Class VIII. Where will I get him admitted next year? asked a guardian. 

 The headmaster, Gurusaday Mallick, said Madhyamik students were sent through other schools during the past 10 years. We will not take students in Class IX from 2006.

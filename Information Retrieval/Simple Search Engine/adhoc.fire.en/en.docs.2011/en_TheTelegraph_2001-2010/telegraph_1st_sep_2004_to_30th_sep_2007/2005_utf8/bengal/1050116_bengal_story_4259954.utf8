 Panel glare on insults at students 

 - Teacher turmoil at Jadavpur University

 MITA MUKHERJEE 

 Calcutta, Jan. 15: Complaints of abusive behaviour by teachers towards girl students has prompted a commission set up in Jadavpur University to recommend measures to maintain a congenial atmosphere in classrooms. 

 The one-man commission of Justice L.M. Ghosh, a retired judge of Calcutta High Court, has suggested the formation of a cell to hear grievances of the students periodically. The university, which has received several awards and high ratings from the Centre for academic excellence, already has a sexual harassment prevention cell. 

 The commission was formed in 2003 after a lecturer brought allegations of torture against his senior. Pradeep Kundu, lecturer in the department of printing engineering, complained that he was assaulted by Alok Kumar Ghosh, a former head of the department. 

 While investigating the allegation, Justice Ghosh received several complaints from a section of teachers and students that Ghosh used abusive language while dealing with students, including girls. 

 Justice Ghosh submitted a report to the university last October. Excerpts of the report were taken up at the executive council, one of the two highest policy-making bodies of the university. But the meeting remained inconclusive as most the members requested the authorities to examine the full text of the report. 

 ?It has been clearly established that Prof. Ghosh regularly used abusive language as well as slang towards the students, including girls, creating a terrible fear psychosis among them,? Justice Ghosh has said in the report. 

 He has urged the varsity to take a string of remedial measures to maintain ?a congenial academic atmosphere in the institution and develop a healthy relationship amongst teachers and students?. Some of them are: 

 Teachers should not misbehave 

 with students, particularly girls

 Teachers should work towards 

 creating a healthy atmosphere

 Every teacher must have 

 a dignified approach while dealing with students

 Teachers should not betray 

 a partisan attitude. 

 The commission also found Ghosh guilty of torturing Kundu. ?Prof. Ghosh, erstwhile head of the department of printing engineering, had exerted physical and mental torture on Pradeep Kundu,? the report said. 

 Registrar Rajat Banerjee said the full report will be placed before the executive council at its next meeting.

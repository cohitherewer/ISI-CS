 Party takes its toll on government

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 5: Only nine out of 30 CPM ministers will be at Writers? Buildings over the next six days. 

 Policy decisions for the state may have to wait as 21 CPM ministers, including Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, deliberate on affairs of the party at its 18th congress, beginning in Delhi tomorrow.

 Most of the ministers have left for the capital and key departments like commerce and industries, finance, health, urban development, labour, transport, education and environment are headless. 

 Bhattacharjee?s cabinet has 42 members, a dozen of them from among the Left Front partners. 

 Till the ministers return, chief secretary Asok Gupta and the departmental secretaries would manage the affairs.

 ?It is true that a number of ministers will be away in Delhi for a few days. But I don?t think normal functioning of the government will be affected. However, certain things, like policy decisions, will have to wait,? said Gupta.

 The ministers, a Writers? official said, had struck off the dates from their appointment diaries as soon as the congress was scheduled. 

 State CPM secretary Anil Biswas said there was no need to appoint an acting chief minister as Bhattacharjee will be in the country. ?We assign a senior minister in the cabinet to take care of the chief minister?s affairs only when he goes abroad,? said Biswas. 

 In the past, the party had asked labour minister Mohammad Amin to be acting chief minister during Bhattacharjee?s foreign tours. This time, Amin, too, would be in Delhi for the next few days. 

 During the CPM?s 17th congress in 2002, Writers? was left similarly deserted.

 Party insiders said senior bureaucrats like the chief secretary and the home secretary have been asked to be on alert over the next six days. Gupta has been told to brief the chief minister regularly about developments in the state. 

 The absence of some could also mean more work for those who have stayed back. 

 These ministers have been asked to attend office regularly and keep a close watch on the day-to-day affairs of the administration. 

 The nine who will man the offices at Writers?, New Secretariat and Salt Lake are Mrinal Banerjee, Nayan Sarkar, Nimai Mal, Nisith Adhikary, Pratyush Mukherjee, Bilasibala Sahis, Iva Dey, Jogesh Barman and Maheswar Murmu.

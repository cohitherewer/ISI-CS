 Polls near, Mamata on the road 

 OUR BUREAU

 Siliguri, Sept. 5: Mamata Banerjee today squatted on the road with about 4,000 supporters and demanded that Delimitation Commission chairman Justice Kuldip Singh hear over 1,000 petitions in about three hours.

 Around 8.45 pm, soon after Trinamul Congress MLA Dipak Ghosh, one of the 10 associate members of the commission, walked out protesting against the members not being given copies of the objections registered with the panel, Mamata went on the war path.

 The guidelines say each associate member must be given a set of papers before the hearings start. The commission is violating its own rules, Ghosh said. 

 Mamata later said that Singh had adjourned the hearing. We may go, if you say so, he told Mamata, who insisted that all 1,100 objections registered with the commission in Siliguri be heard. 

 The judge was here to listen to objections regarding the new demarcations of Lok Sabha and Assembly constituencies in north Bengal.

 But throughout the day, on which many ordinary voters had turned up to voice protest, the Trinamul brigade kept interrupting over two points. 

 First, the set of papers. Second, on state chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjees legitimacy for being on the panel. 

 What right does he have? asked Kalyan Banerjee, who was joined by Saugata Roy. Basudeb Banerjee, go back, go back, shouted supporters.

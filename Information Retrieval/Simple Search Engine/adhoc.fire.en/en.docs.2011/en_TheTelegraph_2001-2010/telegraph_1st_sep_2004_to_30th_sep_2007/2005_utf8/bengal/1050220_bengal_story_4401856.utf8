 Rebel threat to CM rally

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Feb. 19: Naxalites have struck with a vengeance a week before Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s rally. 

 The Communist Party of India (Maoist) has distributed leaflets and posters urging villagers to boycott the chief minister?s rally on February 26 at Pirakata in the Salbani police station area, about 170 km from Calcutta. Pirakata was once a stronghold of the rebels.

 The Naxalites also threatened the CPM?s Dharampur local committee secretary, Anuj Pande, against organising the rally that Bhattacharjee will address after attending a string of government programmes. The rebels had attempted to kill Pande on February 4 when he was returning home from a party meeting.

 The Maoists had distributed the leaflets and posters to scare the villagers, according to the West Midnapore superintendent of police, Ajoy Nanda. ?However, the administration has taken all necessary measures to prevent any untoward incident when the chief minister addresses the rally,? he said. Police personnel will be deployed at vulnerable points, pointed out the district police chief.

 Naxalites have let loose terror in villages despite ?our regular vigil?, said CPM district secretariat member Nirmal Ghosh. ?We fear that the Naxalites are still targeting us after the failed attempt on Pande?s life. As a precaution, we are completing meetings in connection with the proposed rally before dusk,? he said.

 Senior police officials have asked all police stations and outposts in trouble-torn districts of south Bengal to keep at least two dogs each to deal with threats from Maoists.

 An order sent by the deputy inspector-general of Midnapore Range, Gangeswar Singh, asked officers of all police stations and outposts of Bankura, Purulia, East and West Midnapore have been asked to implement the order immediately. They have been asked to pick up and train healthy street dogs in policing, if dogs of good breeds are not available.

 ?One must understand that even cops are human beings and tend to go slack on night duty. But dogs always remain alert. If they find anything wrong, they would immediately start barking,? said Singh.

 ?The practice is nothing new. Wherever the Border Security Force, the Railway Protection Force and others put up a camp, they keep dogs. It helps because they remain alert,? said Nanda.

CPI salvo

 CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan today came down heavily on the CPM for pursuing an industrial policy that is not very labour intensive and has failed to solve the unemployment problem of the state.

 ?Industries that are coming up should be more job-oriented. We have no objection to the chief minister?s initiative to invite industrialists from other states and abroad but he should think about creating employment opportunity,? Bardhan said.

 Murder charge on father

 - Tape of phone call hiring lover?s killers given to cops

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 21: A 22-year-old woman of Kankinada in North 24-Parganas has alleged that her father and four brothers have killed her lover.

 This came to light during the hearing of an anticipatory bail plea by the youngest brother, Mahesh Saw. The other three brothers and the father are already in police custody.

 A Calcutta High Court division bench of Justices Amit Talukdar and S.P. Mitra rejected Mahesh?s bail plea and allowed police to arrest him.

 Sangita Saw had an affair with a local youth, Rajesh Prasad Saw, but her father and brothers would not accept the relationship, according to the case record.

 ?They repeatedly asked Sangita to avoid meeting Rajesh but she did not listen. One day, Sangita and her sister Anjali heard their father, Jawahar Lal, talking to a man over telephone about killing Rajesh. Her father was also offering money to the man for the job,? additional public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami told the court.

 The prosecutor told the court that Sangita had recorded the telephone conversation.

 Sangita, according to Goswami, asked her father and four brothers not to kill Rajesh. ?Ultimately, Jawahar Lal sent Sangita to Mumbai to a relative?s house. Later, Sangita?s mother told her over telephone that her bothers and father had killed Rajesh with the help of hired killers,? according to the case record.

 Soon after receiving the call, Sangita returned to Kankinada and lodged a complaint against her father and brothers at Jagaddal police station.

 ?On the basis of Sangita?s complaint, the Jagaddal police arrested Jawahar Lal and three of his sons. His fourth, Mahesh, fearing arrest, came before your court to get anticipatory bail,? the prosecutor told the bench, requesting it not to grant Mahesh anticipatory bail. Goswami alleged that investigation into the case would be hampered if bail were granted.

 Mahesh?s lawyer, Pinaki Basu, told the bench that his client had played no role in Rajesh?s murder.

 Basu informed the court that Rajesh was married but his wife had left him. ?A divorce case is now on. Sangita?s father did not want his daughter to marry a divorcee and admonished his daughter time and again over this. But it is not true that he hired killers to murder Rajesh,? the lawyer said.

 Basu said police are yet to trace the killers allegedly hired by Jawahar Lal. ?So, it cannot be proved that Sangita?s father was guilty of hiring people to kill Rajesh,? he said.

 The prosecution countered that the accused could help officials investigating the murder find out the whereabouts of the hired killers.

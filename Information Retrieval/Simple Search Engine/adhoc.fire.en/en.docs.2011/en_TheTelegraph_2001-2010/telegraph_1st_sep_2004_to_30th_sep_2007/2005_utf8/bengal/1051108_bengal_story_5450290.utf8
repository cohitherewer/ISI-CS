 Brainstorm for UGC funds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 7: The higher education council today discussed draft proposals for which the government will seek funds from the Centre during the 11th Plan period and ways to increase scope for students.

 The objective, the meeting decided, would be to create opportunities in diverse fields, which would ensure opening for more students. 

 Greater access is one of the areas on which we are laying emphasis. We will soon prepare a final report and send it to the state government, said Subimal Sen, the council vice-chairman. After examining the proposals, the government will send them to Delhi.

 Higher education minister Satyasadhan Chakraborty, senior officials of his department, vice-chancellors of universities and academics were present at the meeting.

 Our primary objective is to create a situation in which more students have access to higher education in the coming years. Diversification is extremely important if we really want to bring more students under the higher education system, said an official who attended the meeting. 

 The state will urge the Centre to allot more funds for running courses in emerging areas like bio-technology and bio-chemistry. More money would also be sought for job-oriented courses in which students can be given hands-on experience.

 Officials said the meeting was held following a University Grants Commission (UGC) directive to the government asking it to send a detailed report on fields in which it wants funds during the 11th Plan period ? 2007 to 2012.

 Writers? rules for temple town

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 4: Pilgrims visiting the Shiva temple at Tarakeswar in Hooghly, 50 km from Calcutta, can now heave a sigh of relief.

 A plethora of complaints regarding harassment of pilgrims in the hands of pandas, who escort tourists from the station with the promise to show them around the temple and help them offer puja, and hoteliers have spurred the government into action.

 ?We want to provide services so that tourists can enter and leave Tarakeswar smiling,? said Tarkeswar MLA Pratim Chatterjee, also the fire services minister.

 Around 2,000 tourists visit the temple daily. The number increases many fold on days held especially auspicious. 

 At a meeting the minister held last Friday with district magistrate Roshni Sen, senior police officers and representatives of the priests and pandas, it was decided that they would have to carry identity cards on their person.

 ?A section of pandas initially tells devotees they will have to pay Rs 100 for everything ? the prasad, flowers and the puja ? but later they demand more, for every item. Hapless pilgrims have to cough up three times the amount initially agreed upon,? said a resident of town familiar with the ways of the temple.

 ?Most tourists who are duped by these people cannot recognise them later because they all wear the same clothes and look the same with shaved heads. If the tourists can identify the person responsible, his licence will be cancelled,? the minister said. The head priest will issue the identity cards. There are about 110 licensed priests and about 250 pandas.

 A crackdown will be launched on illegal lodges that have mushroomed in the town. ?Most of the over 100 lodges are residential houses where rooms are let out to tourists. Many of them do not have basic facilities like running water and proper beds. Tourists who check in are then forced to buy water on their own,? said a government official.

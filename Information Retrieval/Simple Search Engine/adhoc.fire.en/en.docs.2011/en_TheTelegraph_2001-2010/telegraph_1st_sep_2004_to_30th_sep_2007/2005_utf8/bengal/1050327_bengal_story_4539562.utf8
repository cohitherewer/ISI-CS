 First drop for cancer centre

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 26: Siddhi Wohra?s parents had collected over Rs 10 lakh from philanthropists for her bone marrow transplant.

 The couple ? both doctors ? could not save their 15-year-old daughter. But they will not let the money go waste. The Wohras will donate the sum for the construction of a new cancer hospital in the city.

 The 500-bedded hospital, part of Dr Devi Shetty?s dream of building a health city here, is his fourth major project after the Rabindranath Tagore International Institute for Cardiac Sciences, Shankar Netralaya and the Armenian Church Trauma Centre.

 In a live video-conference from Bangalore today, Shetty spoke to the Wohras. ?We want the world to know that the money has been donated for a noble cause,? Swati, Siddhi?s mother, told him.

 The hospital, to be built on a 20-acre plot, will be the nerve centre for both cancer and bone marrow transplant. 

 ?The construction work will start in a few months.... We are hopeful that in two years? time the hospital will be ready,? said Udayan Lahiri, the project administrator.

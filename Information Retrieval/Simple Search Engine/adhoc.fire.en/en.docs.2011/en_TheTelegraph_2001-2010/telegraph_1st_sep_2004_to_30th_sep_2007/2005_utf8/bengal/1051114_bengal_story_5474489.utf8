 Uncles killers force schoolboy into coop

 - Cop cover off, murder witness in fetters

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Nov. 13: In Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Bengal, children dropping out of village schools midway is not rare, but there is probably no one like one 14-year-old, Basir Ahmed.

 The Class VII student from a Murshidabad village has quit school because he is alle-gedly being stalked by the killers of his uncle, against whom he is to testify in court.

 Basir was witness to the murder of Atiur Rahman a year ago. He was shot dead in broad daylight by suspected CPM-backed goons on the way to the Domkol market, about 230 km from Calcutta. Basir was accompanying his uncle to the bazaar when he was accosted at Kuthir More.

 Two policemen, deployed by the district authorities to escort the resident of Sam- bhunagar to and from Ramna National Entrance High School, were withdrawn three months ago. 

 Those accused of the murder in October 2004 are now roaming free and allegedly threatening the boys family. 

 Basirs father Habibur Rahman said: After the murder, police picked up Hamidul Haque. He is now out on bail. Two other accused, Mirshad Sheikh and Jillar Rahman, have not been arrested at all. They have openly announced that my son will be murdered. In the absence of the police guards, I cannot let my son step out of the house. 

 Hamidul was released on bail in March. The threats began coming after that.

 Following an appeal, former Murshidabad superintendent of police Sanjay Singh had arranged the police protection for Basir. But the two guards were withdrawn in the first week of August as the threats had stopped coming, a police officer said. 

 Basirs father said it took little time after that for the threat calls to resume. Basir again applied for police protection on Friday.

 Niraj Kumar Singh, who replaced Sanjay Singh as the district police chief in July, said he would look into the allegation. However, it is not possible to provide two policemen for his security as they have other assignments.

 Basir missed his schools half-yearly examination early this month.

 The Murshidabad CPM leadership today said Atiurs murder had nothing to do with the party. 

 It was not a political murder and our party is in no way involved with it, said Narayan Das, a district secretariat member of the party.

 The police said Basirs uncle Atiur was also a murder accused. Mirshad Sheikhs father Sariful was killed in a clash between two groups of villagers in 2003. Atiur, who was among about 20 people accused in that case, was possibly killed to avenge Sarifuls death, the officer said.

 According to Basirs statement to the police, there were five assailants, including Hamidul, Mirshad and Jillar, all residents of Sambhunagar. 

 Hamidul was arrested. The others are absconding, the police officer said, adding: So, Basir as a witness, is important for us.

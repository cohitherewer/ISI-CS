 Hospital as car park 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Asansol, Feb. 9: A local club last night used the sub-divisional hospital campus here as a car park for a soiree it had organised to raise funds for the tsunami victims. 

 Complaints from patients about the noise and disturbance prompted hospital superintendent Shyamal Sanyal to serve showcause notices on the security guards today.

 ?There is no question of giving permission for parking cars on hospital premises. I have asked the guards to explain why they did not stop outsiders entering the premises at night with cars. I have also sought an explanation from the club. A report has been sent to the SDO and the health authorities,? said Sanyal. 

 Tapas Roy, mayor of the Asansol Municipal Corporation and a patron of the club, was embarrassed and apologised on behalf of the organisers of the Bappi Lahiri show.

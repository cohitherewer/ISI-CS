 BRIEFS

 Burdwan, June 20: Three monkeys have wreaked havoc at Purbasthali here, biting and clawing almost 60 people in 10 days. 

 Among the victims were a dozen policemen. The Purbasthali police station, 120 km from Calcutta, virtually downed shutters today after a constable, Amal Tripathi, was bitten while escorting a duo from the lock-up to the bathroom. Tripathi was admitted to Kalna Subdivisional Hospital. The police station doors are being opened if knocked at. The personnel inside are ensuring whether it is indeed the knock of a human being ? a comp-lainant or a fellow policeman. Kalna subdivisional police officer Rabindranath Bhattacharya said: We are worried.... Forest department officials have been asked to capture the monkeys that have taken shelter on a banyan tree. But they have not responded.

 Barasat: Four people were arrested on charges of raping and murdering a 30-year-old widow. Mafiza Bibi, a mother of three, was allegedly raped and strangled in the early hours of Sunday at Afja village of North 24-Parganas, about 60 km from Calcutta, police said.

 Calcutta: Two government-appointed administrators will oversee the Baruipur and Joynagar-Majilpur municipalities in South 24-Parganas till their chairpersons are elected. The elections had been deferred for five days because of the city civic polls.

 Santiniketan: Non- teaching employees at Visva-Bharati have called off their agitation against recruitment of private security guards. The varsity had extended its summer vacation because of the agitation.

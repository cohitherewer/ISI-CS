 Mamata by students? side

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Jan.8: Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee said tonight she would go to Delhi and place before the Prime Minister the case of students seeking admission to medical colleges in the NRI quota. 

 After hearing out the students and their parents in the SSKM Hospital campus, she said she would ask the Centre to issue an ordinance to bail out the students as a special case. She said the Centre, on a recommendation from the state government, can make a cabinet decision in this matter and the grant the students admission. This could then be informed to the Supreme Court. 

 ?I will take up the matter with the Prime Minister, as it involves the lives of so many young students. If you write to the Prime Minister, I promise to deliver the letter myself,? she said. 

 Mamata also announced that the Trinamul Youth Congress would sit on a dharna outside the SSKM premises from tomorrow in a show of support to the students. 

 Earlier in the day, the parents of the students met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at Alimuddin Street. But the meeting did not yield any result. 

 ?We met him with a lot of hope that he would show us a way out of the nearly dead end, but nothing positive emerged,? one parent said.

 Ten guardians had gone to meet the chief minister around 9.30 am. 

 ?We were sure meeting him would be tough, especially with the Central Committee meeting on schedule. But the chief minister still managed some time for us, and spoke patiently and politely for 15 minutes,? said a guardian.

 But at the end of the meeting, the parents and their wards could not help feeling discouraged despite the chief minister?s sympathetic words. 

 ?He just stopped short of saying nothing positive was possible for the government at this stage,? the parent said.

 The chief minister said the matter was sub-judice, and the government doesn?t want to commit anything to us under the circumstances. The state has moved a higher apex court bench already.

 Student scrutiny before varsity results

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Nov. 3: Burdwan University will show answer scripts to examinees before their results are published, something no other varsity in Bengal has done yet.

 To begin with, the system will be first at the post-graduate level ? from the next academic year.

 Gradually, we will introduce it at the undergraduate level, too, covering all the colleges under the university, said Shoroshi Mohan Dawn, the registrar. 

 The university has 85 colleges in its fold with about 80,000 students. The post-graduate students number around 650.

 Dawn admitted that the move was prompted by allegations of improper assessment and an increasing number of applications for review of answer scripts. 

 The review is often a laborious and lengthy process. The examinees, too, suffer. So, the new system, he added.

 A university official said: It will be an experiment for us. We have yet to work out the dos and donts. 

 Every year, thousands of students who feel they ought to have scored more approach the university for review. The university charges Rs 60 for the review of a paper and it takes five to six months to publish the revised result or let the examinee know that there is no change in marks.

 After the review, there is often no time left for the student to take admission in a subject of choice. This delay can be avoided if we furnish the answer scripts beforehand and let the examinees go through it, Dawn said.

 The examiners of answer scripts of a particular college would be present there when the students are shown the papers. Their confusion ? regarding corrections and marks obtained ? can be cleared immediately, said a senior university official.

 All teachers under Burdwan University have been informed about the decision. We will also have to inform teachers of other universities who correct our post-graduate exam scripts. This will take some time. We will make all arrangements to bring them to the university for their interaction with the examinees, said the registrar.

 Students welcomed the move. Maitrayee Banerjee, a final-year mathematics honours student, said the new system should leave them no room for complaint.

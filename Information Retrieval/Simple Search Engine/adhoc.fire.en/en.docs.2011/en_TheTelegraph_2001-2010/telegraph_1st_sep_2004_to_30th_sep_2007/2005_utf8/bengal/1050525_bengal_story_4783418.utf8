 Poison plants get away with murder

 - Damage 

 from sponge iron units Rs 10 crore-plus 

 JAYANTA BASU

 Calcutta, May 24: An environmental committee powered by city institutes has found that highly polluting sponge iron units are damaging health and environment in Bankura, Burdwan and Purulia.

 Sponge iron units remain highly polluting... causing severe damages to human and cattle health, besides causing other environmental damages, says its report. 

 The panel, constituted by the Pollution Control Appellate Authority, included officials from the Environment Impact Assessment Committee, the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health, Jadavpur University and the state pollution control board.

 There are 34 sponge iron units in the state, mainly in the three districts. The report says all the sponge iron units are now suffering from the effects of poor housekeeping (coal char dust has indiscriminately been kept inside the premises) and that none of the units had undertaken any serious measure to mitigate the hazards faced by workers exposed to coal dust.

 The committee found evidence to substantiate complaints of local residents. Soot covers houses and vegetation and the paddy grown in the region is often unfit for consumption, the farmers had alleged. Carbon particles have rendered the water bodies unfit for use.

 Gautam Gupta, the economist on the panel, estimated that the annual cost of damage caused by sponge iron units amounts to over Rs 10 crore, while long-term problems like loss of human fertility could not be calculated.

 Villagers in Bankura and Purulia are vocal against the offending units. They often shut down their electrostatic precipitator (the pollution control device), especially at night. A cloud of black smoke engulfs the area affecting virtually everything, said a man at Poraria village in Purulia. Complaints to police and political leaders are not heeded.

 But the leaders are aware of the menace. We often see that the units do not run the ESP after sundown. We have informed the district magistrate as well as central party leaders, said Sujit Chakrabarty of the CPM-run Barjora panchayati samiti. His area has four such factories. 

 Block development officer Arundhuti Bhowmick said it is not possible to always monitor the units. But she agreed that the black dust is causing major problems for local habitations and crop. None of the factories have a proper green belt either.

 Pollution control board chairman Sudip Banerjee said if the board finds any of the units out of line, it would be closed or fined. Four units are already under closure. Many have been asked to submit bank guarantees or fined. Government sources also suggested that new sponge iron units would not be allowed in certain adversely affected areas.

 But fines cannot be a real deterrent as these units make huge profits and continue running even after closure is ordered, alleged an environment dedepartment official.

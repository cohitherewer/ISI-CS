 Bids for number plates again

 OUR BUREAU

 April 24: Amid allegations of corruption, the government has decided to cancel the tenders it had floated for supply of high-security registration plates, commonly known as ?electronic number plates?.

 ?The chief minister has approved of the cancellation of old tenders and new tenders will be called for soon. We are consulting the advocate-general on the cancellation of the earlier tenders,? transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said today. 

 In July 2003, the West Bengal Transport Infrastructure Development Corporation had floated tenders for the supply of high-security licence plates and four companies responded with their bids. 

 In February, one of the bidders, Shimnit Utsch, moved the high court against a Peruvian bidder, EHA Schider and Werbeteschnik Hoffman, alleging that the papers it had submitted in support of its technical bid were false.

 According to a report from the Indian high commission in Peru, Hoffman did not qualify for the contract. 

 Experience in supplying number plates was a key criterion for the selection of bidders, which Hoffman did not have.

 However, the transport secretary said the government has decided to cancel the tenders because it wanted more representation from bidders. ?We don?t want to choose from among only three bidders,? Chowdhury said. One of the four bidders for the contract had dropped out after the preliminary stage.

 The case filed by Shimnit Utsch will come up for hearing tomorrow.

 The Centre wants the number plates to be fitted in vehicles across the country to reduce theft and monitor vehicles more effectively. 

 In January, the Centre had passed a notification saying that the order on the high-security number plates had to be implemented from ?May 1 or before?.

 Honk ban around HC, hospitals

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 10: The government has decided to address the problem of increasing noise levels throughout the city by declaring areas around government hospitals and the high court area as silence zones.

 Writers Buildings and the Governors House will be next on the silence zone map. The rules for silence zones will also apply to subdivisional and district hospitals.

 While we have notified the city government hospitals and Calcutta High Court, the transport department has been asked to issue another notification including Writers Buildings as well as the Governors House as no-horn areas, an environment department official said.

 Noise pollution rules stipulate the permissible noise limits for industrial, commercial and residential areas during day and at night. But officials said it is difficult to demarcate such zones as areas in each of these categories often spill into others. However, a beginning is being made with premises like government hospitals and the high court.

 They emphasised that other states have also not been able to clearly demarcate industrial, commercial and residential areas in respect of implementing noise pollution norms.

 We had left it for the city police to decide the areas since they would be the primary implementing agency once this order is issued, said Asim Burman, principal secretary of the environment department.

 The institutions concerned have been asked to file complaints with the pollution control board and/or the police if the rules are flouted.

 Signboards informing people about the dos and donts in silence zones ? no honking, a ban on bursting firecrackers and use of loudspeakers within 100 m of the building ? will be put up near these buildings.

 Most people have very little idea about silence zones and in many places, there are no signboards. It is also difficult to monitor motorists all the time. So, we are repeating the rule to everyone concerned, said a senior officer of the West Bengal Pollution Control Board.

 Vehicular horns, loudspeakers, music systems and construction activity are mostly responsible for noise pollution in the city.

 According to the West Bengal Motor Vehicles Rules, motorists honking in no-horn zones can be fined Rs 100 the first time, and Rs 300 thereafter.

 In addition to the ban on use of horns, this would mean that loudspeakers cannot be used for public meetings and pujas in the area within the 100-metre radius. The Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2002, also stipulate that there will be a complete ban on the use of firecrackers in these areas.

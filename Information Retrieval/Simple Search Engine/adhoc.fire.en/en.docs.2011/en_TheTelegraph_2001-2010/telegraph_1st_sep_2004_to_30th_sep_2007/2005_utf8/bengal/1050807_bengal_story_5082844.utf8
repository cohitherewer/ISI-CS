 Accused in net after cop goof-up

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Aug. 6: Dilip Das, who has been eluding the police in a 10-year-old molestation case, was arrested yesterday.

 Dilip, the son of a retired head constable, was produced before the additional chief judicial magistrates court this afternoon and remanded in judicial custody.

 Radharani Das, a housewife at Baranilpur-Kumarpara, about 130 km from Calcutta, had lodged a complaint against Dilip, her neighbour, on July 13, 1995. He was arrested the same day and released on bail the next month. Between 1995 and 2003, he never appeared in court for the trial. The court issued a warrant of arrest against him on December 4, 2003.

 The police then arrested Shantiranjan, a lottery ticket seller, on May 30, 2004, as his nickname matched with Dilip. 

 Traders shutdown

 Shops and business establishments around the New Jalpaiguri station remained closed today following yesterdays clashes between two factions of Citu, the CPMs labour arm. A strike was called by the businessmen to protest alleged police harassment.

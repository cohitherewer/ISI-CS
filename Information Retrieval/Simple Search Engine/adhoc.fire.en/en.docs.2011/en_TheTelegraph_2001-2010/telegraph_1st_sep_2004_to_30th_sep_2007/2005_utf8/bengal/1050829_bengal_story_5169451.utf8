 Salary axe on ex-MLA

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Aug. 28: Burdwan University has stopped paying salary to former Congress MLA Shyamdas Banerjee, its finance department employee, who has been charged with cheating. 

 A showcause notice has been served on Banerjee, who was earlier expelled from the party on charges of cheating.

 The universitys executive council found him guilty of taking loan from a nationalised bank by furnishing forged documents. He had also allegedly presented certificates to the bank bearing forged signatures of senior officials of the varsitys audit department.

 A former legislator from Hirapur, Banerjee had recently sought voluntary retirement from the university. The council rejected it. 

 Banerjee was expelled from the Assembly on charges of withdrawing funds by submitting false medical bills. He had claimed Rs 1.65 lakh for the treatment of his wife and mother. 

 Vice-chancellor Amit Mullick said the university has informed the concerned bank about its decision. Preliminary investigations have revealed that he forged the signature of the accounts and audit officer of the university to get the loan, he added. A three-member inquiry commission has been set up to further probe the charges against Banerjee.

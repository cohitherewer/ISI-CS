 Great Eastern dues vow

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 8: The government has today sought to reassure employees of Great Eastern Hotel by guaranteeing the settlement of retirement dues and all arrears of workers who apply for the early retirement scheme by April 18.

 No employee has so far opted for the renewed retirement scheme that opened on April 6 and closes on April 18.

 ?The government guarantees the payment of the ERS cheque, as well as all other arrears, latest by June end, but only to those who apply for the scheme by April 18,? tourism secretary T.K. Barman said today. Till then, the applicants would continue to receive their salary, he said.

 The assurance came in the light of reports that employees were unsure about when they would get their dues if they opted for the scheme. Three employees asked the hotel member secretary, Jagannath Bag, today about the details of the scheme.

 ?They all wanted to know how much their settlement would amount to and by when their dues would be settled,? said an official of the tourism department.

 The government today sent the hotel an computerised format prepared for calculating the dues of applicants under the scheme, including the ex-gratia and retirement benefits, to ensure a ready reckoner of retirement dues.

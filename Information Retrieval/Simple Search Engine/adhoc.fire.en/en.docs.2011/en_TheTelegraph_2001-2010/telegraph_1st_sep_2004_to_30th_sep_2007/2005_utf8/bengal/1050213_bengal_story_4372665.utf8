 Shutters on schools 

 RABI BANERJEE 

 Krishnagar, Feb. 12: The government has decided to close down 25 state-aided primary schools in Nadia district, faced with a sharp drop in the number of students.

 With several private schools coming up in the district, some of them English medium, there are few takers for state-run primary institutions, officials said. 

 Of the 25 schools about to face the axe, 15 are in Nabadwip and the rest in Ranaghat and Haringhata. Most of them are over 50 years old.

 Nadia district magistrate Rajesh Pandey said the dwindling numbers have nothing to do with children dropping out of school. ?In some schools, the number of students have plummeted to as low as 10 against a capacity of 300. It was not at all cost effective. We were left with no option other than to close down the schools,? he said.

 About 500 students and some 200 teaching and non-teaching employees from these 25 schools will be shifted to other primary schools in the area that are doing better, Pandey said. Headmasters are also being shifted and they will now work as ordinary teachers.

 Parents want to put their children in institutions where they can study till Class X, school education secretary Debaditya Chakraborty pointed out. ?This trend is expected. This also shows that the parents are serious about their children?s education.? 

 District officials admitted there is a general impression that private schools are better than state-aided ones. ?There is no denying the fact that people now realise the government?s blunder in abolishing English at the primary level. Even though English has now been brought back, the impression about private schools are better,? an official said. 

 ?The process of closing down the schools and shifting students has started and it is expected to be completed by the end of this month. The government had to spend a lot to educate a few,? the district magistrate said. 

 ?While relocating the students, we will also try to ensure they don?t have to travel much. We are trying to strike a balance,? said Birendranath Chatterjee, district inspector of schools (primary).

 The CPM-controlled West Bengal Primary Teachers? Association, however, is crying foul. ?The students who had to walk a few minutes to reach their schools will now have to travel by bus,? association secretary Bidyut Bhowmik said.

 ?Killer? tutor

 Calcutta, April 14: Sleuths who went to Rajgir looking for the five-year-old girl allegedly pushed off by her father from a hillock there, failed to make any breakthrough today. 

 They were even unable to locate the place where the incident took place. Somnath Dawn, 52, went to Rajgir with his 13-year-old son, daughter and student, a 19-year-old girl, last month. After eliminating his daughter and abandoning his son, he fled to Mayapur in Nadia to live with the student.

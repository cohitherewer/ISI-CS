 Flyover fillip to neglected north

 SIMI KAMBOJ

 Calcutta, Oct. 15: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has finally turned its attention to road development projects in north Calcutta, choosing to address complaints of long neglect when elections are approaching.

 To begin with, the government is reviving the project for the Vivekananda Road flyover, which will connect Brabourne Road to Girish Park. 

 A revised plan was discussed at a meeting chaired by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee a few days back. According to this, the Rs 90-crore flyover would start from the point where the Brabourne Road flyover terminates and end on Vivekananda Road at Girish Park, with an arm also touching Strand Road. 

 Asok Bhattacharya, the minister for urban development, said his department has been authorised to handle the project. 

 Weve had a preliminary discussion with the chief minister. He has suggested that Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority implement the project with financial assistance from the National Urban Renewal Mission, the minister said on Friday evening. 

 The Centre has sanctioned Rs 300 crore to the state government under the National Urban Renewal Mission. 

 The new flyover would ease congestion on the approach to Howrah station and reduce traffic pressure on arterial roads like K.K. Tagore Street, Strand Road, Strand Bank Road, the Rabindra Sarani intersection, M.G. Road and Nimtala Ghat street.

 This, however, is not the only project north Calcutta to have got a boost. 

 State finance minister Asim Dasgupta has loosened his ministrys purse strings to shell out Rs 21 crore that will be used to concretise some of the busiest roads and intersections in the north and central parts of the city.

 These include the Shyambazar five-point crossing, Bidhan Sarani, College Street, Nirmal Chandra Street and Rabindra Sarani (Chitpur Road). 

 Tram tracks along these roads will be removed and will again be re-laid after the roads are concretised. Work will start in November, Dasgupta said.

 Traffic experts are seeing the plan to turn the roads concrete as a positive step.

 Once tram tracks are made level with road surface and riding quality of these roads improved, average speed of traffic along these corridors is bound to pick up. Vehicles will be able to move out of signal intersections faster and chances of traffic piling up will lessen, said a traffic and transportation engineer of the transport department.

 The finance minister had earlier announced allotment of Rs 42 crore to concretise Lenin Sarani, B.B. Ganguly Street, M.G. Road and the stretch between Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and Bidhan Sarani. 

 North Calcutta has been utterly neglected in the last five years. As far as road infrastructure is concerned, there is a yawning gap between facilities in the north and south. I am determined to bridge this gap, Dasgupta said.

 Observers, however, attribute the governments initiative as a way to woo north and central Calcutta voters.

 From building flyovers to building pedestrian over-bridges, the state government has done nothing for north Calcutta in recent times. Most of the road projects were taken up in south, possibly because both the chief minister as well as the former and present mayor of Calcutta live there, said Bartala MLA and chairman of Assembly standing committee on transport, Sadhan Pande.

 However, Im thankful that Asim babu has finally taken notice of the state of north Calcutta roads, he said. 

 Pande pointed out that it was because of coming elections that the government is trying to expedite the Vivekananda Road flyover ? the only project in north Calcutta.

 However, transport experts said planning projects in north and central Calcutta has always involved a host of problems, primarily because of lack of space.

 North Calcutta roads are full of encroachments. If a flyover is being built here, there is little scope for diverting traffic as there are no wide enough roads to handle additional traffic volume, a state government official said, but conceded that the government has never paid serious attention to the north. 

 In 2002-20003, the government had planned two flyovers ? one at Mullickbazar and another at Moulali ? but both were abandoned after objections by Calcutta Municipal Corporation. Two others ? a one-way flyover along EM Bypass (at Hudco junction to VIP Road crossing) and another near the airport running along Jessore Road ? were shelved for lack of funds.

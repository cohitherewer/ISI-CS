 Directory to save heritage

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 8: The government has decided to prepare a Heritage Directory following attempts by some realtors to grab heritage properties to construct high-rises.

 The public works department has been entrusted with the task of bringing out the directory, Oitijhyer Sandhane (In Search of Heritage), which will contain detailed descriptions of heritage buildings and historical sites along with their photographs and is also expected to benefit researchers and students of history.

 The government has also taken steps to make the state heritage commission ? formed to look after heritage properties ? more effective.

 The commission, headed by veteran educationist and former Union minister Pratap Chandra Chunder, has been asked to submit a report on the status of heritage buildings across the state.

 ?Our move aims at protecting heritage properties and historical sites in a planned manner,? said PWD minister Amar Chowdhury. ?We lack a comprehensive list of heritage properties and sites in Bengal. Separate agencies like Calcutta Municipal Corporation, the urban development department and the heritage commission have prepared separate lists in a scattered manner. Hence, we want to prepare an integrated directory,? he said.

 The minister said the directory would be virtually a handbook on heritage properties. ?PWD officials are preparing it with active support and assistance from different individuals and organisations,? Chowdhury said.

 The directory, PWD officials said, would be sent to district magistrates, sub-registry offices, municipalities, corporations and panchayats.

 There are more than a thousand heritage sites throughout the state, of which only 300 have been identified so far, according to officials.

 ?We have information that over a hundred heritage sites in the city and the neighbouring districts have already changed hands and may undergo changes for commercial gains. We are trying to trace the sites and intend to take action once they are located,? said an official.

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said the government has appealed to industrial houses and NGOs to help preserve the heritage sites. ?Some have already responded to our appeal. We will provide all kind of assistance to them in preserving the sites,?? Bhattacharya said.

 Chunder said only a united effort by the government and the people can save the heritage properties. ?Every heritage site is part of Bengal?s history and we have to strive to protect them,? he said.

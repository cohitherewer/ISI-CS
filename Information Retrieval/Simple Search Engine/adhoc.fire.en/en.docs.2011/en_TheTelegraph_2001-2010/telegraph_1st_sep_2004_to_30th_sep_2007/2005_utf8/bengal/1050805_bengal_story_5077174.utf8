 Boy abducted from hostel

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 4: A Class 

 V student was abducted from his school?s hostel in Nadia 

 early this morning.

 The kidnappers sneaked into the hostel of Ramakrishna-Sarada Mission Vidyapith at Ranaghat, 65 km from Calcutta, around 4 am, police said. The guard at the hostel had dozed off in his room.

 The abductors, who had scaled the boundary wall, knocked on the hostel door. When some students answered the call, the abductors asked for Snehamoy Saha and forcibly took him away.

 Around 9 am, Patit Paban Chakraborty, the boy?s businessman relative in Kalyani, got a ransom call over the phone but no amount was specified. The kidnappers called twice later, asking Chakraborty to arrange the money but did not specify the amount.

 ?They asked for the phone number of Snehamoy?s father Sanatan, who stays in Jalpaiguri,? said Nadia additional police superintendent Biswarup Ghosh. Sanatan, an affluent farmer, reached Ranaghat tonight.

 Snehamoy?s hostel mates mustered the courage to tell headmaster Jiban Karmakar about the abduction much later in the morning.

 Karmakar said the boy had a record of breaking hostel rules. ?He was scolded several times for sneaking out. But we could not do anything as his father lives far away.?

 Police said a search has been launched to trace the boy. ?We think someone who knows Snehamoy and his family is behind the kidnapping. When they called after the kidnap, they repeatedly asked for his father?s phone number and his whereabouts. The abduction may have taken place to settle a score,? said Ghosh.

 Drive to dress up Dalhousie Square

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 23: Dalhousie Square is to get a facelift.

 A two-day workshop at the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry brought up concrete proposals to help the citys most prized heritage zone regain its lost glory.

 Dalhousie Square has been listed by the World Monument Fund (WMF) among the 100 most endangered heritage sites in the world.

 Organised by the state department of cultural affairs, Action Research and Conservation of Heritage (Arch) and the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (Intach), the workshop was inaugurated yesterday by governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi and mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya.

 The programme included a walk around Dalhousie Square at 7.30 this morning. 

 Architects, urban planners, restoration experts, archaeologists and employees of companies and government departments housed in buildings in the area participated in the event. 

 The workshop also gave concrete shape to the plan to form the Dalhousie Square Society. We have been working on it since 2002. We got a grant from the India Foundation for the Arts, Bangalore, of Rs 5 lakh, for research and documentation on Dalhousie Square, said Manish Chakrabarti of Arch. 

 Then we sent an application to WMF to include it in the endangered list. Intachs local chapter seconded it, he added.

 The WMF is pumping in more grants ? $75,000 from American Express for a workshop and the fa?ade restoration of one building. The workshop is done and the renovation of the Standard Assurance structure will kick off in a few months.

 We hope that this will be like a model for others to follow, said Mark Weber, the technical director of the WMF. This was the seat of the British empire and is a very important heritage site for the entire country. But it has lost significance for those outside Calcutta.

 One of the most positive outcomes of the workshop, many agreed, was throwing the ownership of the project into a wide spectrum.

 For architect Debashish Nayak, most importantly, an interface has been created. A lot of proposals were put forth, all of them doable on the ground. There was planning and perspective.

 Chakrabarti said: We found out about government projects like plans for underground parking lots, while corporates like HSBC and Standard Chartered came to us after the workshop offering help. There are ideas being floated around to decrease pollution and congestion in Dalhousie, regularise billboards, etc. Some are short-term, but its a start.

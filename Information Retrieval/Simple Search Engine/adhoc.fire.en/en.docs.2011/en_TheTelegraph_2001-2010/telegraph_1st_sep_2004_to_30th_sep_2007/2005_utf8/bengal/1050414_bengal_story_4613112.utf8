 Father fires suicide FIR at school

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chinsurah, April 13: The father of Tiyasa Biswas, the girl who committed suicide last Wednesday, lodged an FIR this evening against the school authorities and her class teacher and demanded a CID probe.

 Harasit, a pathologist, said tonight the teacher had ?psychologically tortured? his daughter.

 ?After receiving the complaint from Harasit Biswas, we went in search of the Tiyasa?s class teacher in the Barabazar area of Chandannagore town. But we found her house under lock and key,? said Subir Roy, officer-in-charge of Chandannagore police station.

 Biswas said he was sure Tiyasa had left behind a suicide note, which the school authorities had removed. ?Why was I informed so late? The incident occurred at 8 am and I was informed at 9.45 am. I am sure the school authorities have plenty of things to hide. I demand a CID inquiry... and I want the culprits punished.? 

 The night before her death, Tiyasa had told her mother: ?My class teacher is the same person. My life has become a living hell.?

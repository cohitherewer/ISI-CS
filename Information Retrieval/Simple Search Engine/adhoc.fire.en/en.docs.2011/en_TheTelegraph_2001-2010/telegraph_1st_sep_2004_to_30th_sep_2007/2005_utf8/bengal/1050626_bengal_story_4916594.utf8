 Great Eastern staff deal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Solution in sight: The Great Eastern Hotel

 Calcutta, June 25: One of the biggest hurdles to the privatisation of Great Eastern was cleared today. Intuc, the largest union at the 170-year-old hotel, accepted the early retirement scheme for its members after the government acceded to several demands.

 Intuc agreed to accept the ERS by the June 30 deadline.

 State Intuc president and former mayor Subrata Mukherjee today met public enterprises minister Nirupam Sen at Writers Buildings for an hour to discuss the unions demands, which the government agreed to settle.

 The union had some valid demands related to the final financial settlements of the employees?. we have agreed upon the issues. Intuc has assured that the employees will apply for ERS, Sen said.

 Sen said Rs 25,000 would be paid to each of those on contract (as a one-time additional payment over and above the final dues), Mukherjee said. The minister said he had asked the Great Eastern Hotel Authority to work out the details of this one-time payment.

 Other demands that the government has agreed to include implementation of a career advancement scheme. We will request the new owners to give preference to the young employees working in the hotel now, Sen said.

 Besides, the ERS would be accepted when the new owner is selected as this would ensure that employees are paid their salaries till then. Workers would also be given notice and three-months pay.

 I was confident things would be settled?. Intuc wanted some time due to the Calcutta Municipal Corporation elections?. Now there is no more hurdle, Sen said.

 I am happy because Subrata Mukherjee has himself come to discuss the matter. He is a senior Intuc leader and was part of the Trinamul?. Now of course, he does not belong to the Trinamul anymore, said the minister.

 Sen said he expects the transaction for the hotel to be completed this year. The expression of interests would be discussed over the next one month to six weeks after which the selection would be made.

 There are some technical and legal details?so the entire process is expected to be completed by October-November?. I cant say for sure if it will be around the pujas, but the whole transaction should be done by this year, Sen said.

 The minister felt the Citu would not pose a problem, though its demand, made yesterday, that services of contractual staff be regularised was rejected by tourism secretary Tapan Barman.

 However, Citu leader Rajdeo Goala was noncommittal. Before discussing the matter with the employees, I cannot say anything, he said when asked if his union members would also apply for the ERS.

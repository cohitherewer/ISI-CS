 Mind your bones, the niggle could be serious 

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Calcutta, Feb. 26: Junk food, irregular dietary habits and extreme stress is not only telling in the heart of Calcuttans, but also eating into the bones.

 If it is rickets among children, slowing movement, teenagers are complaining of pain ? osteomalacia, which softens up bones. Adults are coming to hospitals with osteoporosis ? degeneration of bones that causes fractures.

 ?The number of such patients has increased alarmingly across all age groups. We receive at least 300 patients a month with osteoporosis alone,? said orthopaedic surgeon Buddhadeb Chatterjee.

 According to experts, 70 per cent of fractures among adults are a result of underlying osteoporosis. ?Most patients are completely unaware of their calcium deficiency. They are astonished to know that osteoporosis resulted in the fracture,? Chatterjee said.

 Calcium deficiency occurs over a long period of dietary inadequacy. Orthopaedic surgeon Sunil Thakur said: ?Repeated childbirth, sickness, stress and junk food contribute to it. Calcium, which builds bones and teeth and gives them their strength, is the most abundant mineral in the body. The teeth and bones contain 99 per cent of the body?s calcium. The remaining 1 per cent is in extra-cellular fluids and blood.? 

 About 40 per cent of the bone build-up occurs during teens, but today?s junk-food fad slows down the process.

 ?Not many people know that calcium is also necessary for muscle contraction, blood clotting and maintenance of cell membranes. Bad food habits, especially over-consumption of aerated drinks, escalates bone damage at a young age,? said Chatterjee. The deficiency results in weakness of muscles, delays growth and healing of fractures.

 Doctors have now embarked upon educating patients about the need to take care of their bones. They are recommending food rich in calcium ? small fish, milk, eggs and fruits. Sunlight, a source of Vitamin D, is also an essential. 

 The first symptoms of the deficiency, experts said, are: 

 Irritability and nervousness

 Fatigue

 Muscle and menstrual cramp

 Insomnia

 Periodontal disease 

 High blood pressure

 Keeping in mind the importance of calcium for the development of the skeletal structure of new-borns, pregnant women have been identified as target groups for special emphasis. 

 ?If a pregnant woman does not take calcium, either through diet or supplements, the calcium present in her bone tissue gets released to meet the demands of the developing foetus,? said gynaecologist Purabi Mukherjee. 

 The deficiency of calcium among women results in osteopenia (decreasing bone density). A majority of post-menopausal women suffer from problems like osteoporosis because the secretion of the female hormone, Oestrogen, stops. 

 Mukherjee said: ?The absorption of calcium, which helps the muscles and nerves function normally, decreases with age. It?s important that the elderly receive adequate amounts of it in their diet.? Vitamin D is essential for the absorption, she added.

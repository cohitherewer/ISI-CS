 Confession claim in Salt Lake death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 21: Police today claimed that Prabir Dasgupta, a senior official of the Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC), has confessed to murdering his sister-in-law Pritha Nag.

 A preliminary medical examination has also revealed that she was strangled. 

 ?Prabir Dasgupta has confessed to us that he has committed the crime,? a senior CID official said.

 Pritha, who had come to visit her sister Ileena at Anushakti Abasan ? the residential complex for VECC employees in Salt Lake?s AF block ? died on Tuesday. Police arrested Prabir and Ileena and the CID took over the case the next day and sealed the couple?s flat. Forensic experts examined it today and collected samples.

 CID sources said Prabir had probably drugged Pritha before strangling her. ?We have reports that Prabir had been purchasing sleeping pills from neighbourhood medicine stores for the last few days,? said an official. CID sleuths are likely to speak to the medicine shops.

 Pritha, a resident of Dover Terrace, had come to stay with her sister and brother-in-law in the last week of March.

 Police suspect a dispute over the sisters? three-storeyed house in Dover Terrace was behind the murder. ?We have received reports that the two sisters fought legal battles over property,? an official said.

 Prabir and Ileena were produced before Aloke Chowdhury, the Salt Lake sub-divisional judicial magistrate, yesterday and are slated to appear in court on April 25.

 Pritha?s driver Pradeep Mishra had lodged a complaint at Bidhannagar (North) police station, based on which the couple was arrested.

 Dark, hospital to hospital

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Aug. 25: Four patients waiting to be operated upon at RG Kar Medical College and Hospital had to be shifted to NRS as lights went off around 8.50 this evening. But by the time they made it to the second hospital, it had plunged into darkness, too. 

 The emergency operation theatre was worst hit. Since a doctor cannot operate in the dark, patients had to be referred to other hospitals. Power failure seems to be a recurrent problem for us and we are not sure how to handle things, said Utpal Dutta, the principal of RG Kar Medical College. 

 Emergency lights were held out for doctors who could not stop mid-way two Caesarean operations that had begun. Nursing staff scrambled across wards for candles.

 Besides the OT, the intensive care unit and the paediatrics and gynaecology wards were affected at RG Kar. 

 At NRS, doctors said an appendicitis operation on a 25-year-old had to be put off.

 While at RG Kar the connection was restored at 11 pm, at NRS, the lights returned in phases, leaving the emergency unit in the dark well past midnight. 

 The latest round of power cuts ? the fourth at RG Kar in the past few weeks and the second at NRS ? came hours before superintendents of all medical colleges in the city meet the director of medical education to discuss, among other things, power supply.

 CESC officials pleaded ignorance about the incidents. I have not been informed, said D.N. Majumder, its executive director (distribution).

 This is the second time in the last few weeks that lights have tripped at the NRS edical College while at the RG Kar Medical College, this is the fourth time when such tripping have left the hospital in the dark.

 at the hospitals.

 Bihar fugitives arrested in city

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, July 16: Two criminals, who had been eluding police net in Bihar for months, were picked up from the New Market area today.

 Mohammed Saikul, a notorious gangster from Roh village in Nawada district, was arrested late this afternoon. He has been charged with the murder of RJD leader Islam Siddiqui during the Bihar polls in 2004. 

 While conducting the raid, police stumbled on Mohammad Nessar from the same village, who was wanted for months in connection with the kidnapping of an 11-year-old girl. He is Siddiquis son-in-law.

 From investigations so far, it appears that besides playing a key role in the murder of Siddiqui, Saikul has string of charges against him. He had been coming here on and off and we finally managed to get him today, said Ajay Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police (central). 

 Sources in the New Market police station said besides the murder, Saikul has several charges of kidnapping and extortion against him. Also a con- tract killer, he allegedly teamed up with Mohammad Azmal, a gang lord in Nawada, to murder Siddiqui on May 1, 2004. 

 Siddiqui was picked up from his house at Roh and beaten to death with an iron rod. His body was found buried near Azmals house. 

 The police managed to arrest Azmal, now a life convict, but not Saikul.

 In the past few months, a Bihar police team visited the New Market police station at least thrice looking for Saikul. The last time they came was on June 11, when they left behind all details about him, including a photograph. 

 When the police today turned up to arrest him, Nessar ? he owns a motor parts shop on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road and stays at Motijheel in Dum Dum ? also appeared in the scene. When Saikul saw Nessar, he told the police that he was also a criminal and should be arrested.

 The New Market police station later called up the Nawada superintendent to ascertain their criminal antecedents.

Calcutta, May 23: Buddhadeb 

 Bhattacharjees government would like financial assistance 

 from the Centre, but with no strings attached, please.

 The Bengal government also has objections to reforms Delhi has prescribed as a condition for new projects.

 Urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya today said the Manmohan Singh government has decided to close the ongoing Megacity Project and replace it with a new National Urban Renewal Mission.

 The Rs 1,600-crore Megacity Project is on in Calcutta, Howrah, Asansol, Durgapur and other towns having a population of over five lakh ?Rs 735 crore has already been spent on projects relating to drinking water, housing, roads and transport. 

 The project was sanctioned when Pranab Mukherjee was the Planning Commission deputy chairman. The Centre should complete the project or else the ongoing work will remain unfinished , said Bhattacharya.

 He also accused the Centre of forcing reforms down the throat. The minister said: The Centre should arrange a meeting of all urban development ministers to discuss the reforms instead of forcing them down throats. 

 Bhattacharya said of the Rs 735 crore, Delhi contributed Rs 291.64 crore. They had to give another Rs 37 crore as part of their share, but the Union urban affairs minister has said only Rs 31 crore will be provided before the project is closed.

 The Centre has allocated Rs 5,500 crore under the new mission this year. Calcutta and Asansol would be part of the project, but the chief minister also wants Howrah and Siliguri to be included.

 Of the proposed reforms, the state has decided to relax the ceiling on urban land instead of repealing the land ceiling act. The Centre had wanted it repealed to facilitate the entry of realtors to usher rapid urbanisation. 

 The Centre also wants the stamp fee for land registration reduced, but the cash strapped state has no plans to oblige. Municipalities across Bengal are struggling to strike a public-private partnership in their projects and to levy tax on services.

 There were howls of protests when the NDA regime had earlier linked disbursal of funds with the performance of the civic bodies.

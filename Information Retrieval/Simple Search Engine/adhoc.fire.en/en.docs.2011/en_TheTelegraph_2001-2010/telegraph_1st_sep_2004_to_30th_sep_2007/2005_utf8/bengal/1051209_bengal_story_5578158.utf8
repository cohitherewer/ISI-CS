 Power policy punch

 Calcutta, Dec 8: State power minister Mrinal Banerjee today said if the draft national tariff policy was not reviewed, the government might be forced to invoke its special powers under the electricity act and ask the State Electricity Regulatory Commission to ignore the policy, says a staff reporter.

 In a letter to Union power minister P.M. Sayeed, Banerjee said Bengal had reservations about the proposed method of cross-subsidy surcharge as laid down in the draft policy.

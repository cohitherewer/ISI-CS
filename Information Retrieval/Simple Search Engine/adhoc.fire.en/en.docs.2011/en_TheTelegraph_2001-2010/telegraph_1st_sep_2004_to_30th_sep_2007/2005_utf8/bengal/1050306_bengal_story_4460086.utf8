 Asansol, March 5: Come 2008 and Asansol will have its own integrated satellite township to boast of. 

 Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee today laid the foundation stone of Shrishtinagar, a 75-acre plot at Kanyapur, some 240 km from Calcutta.

 The land is owned by the Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority and is going to be built by Bengal Shristi, a joint-sector company comprising the development authority and the Shristi Infrastructure Development Corporation. The development authority also has a tie-up with SembCorp Infrastructure, a Singapore government-run infrastructure consultant. 

 ?This will be a maiden venture of SembCorp in West Bengal along with Bengal Shristi,? said Hemant Kanoria, the managing director. 

 ?Our aim is to create a township having every modern facility from a shopping mall to a community centre and facilities for health and entertainment on its premises. At the same time, it will be built along the green principle so that the ambience is serene and environment friendly,? he added. 

 The high-end target customers for the township are entrepreneurs, who are expected to set up new industrial ventures in and around Asansol,? said a Bengal Shristi official. 

 ?Besides, the lower income and the middle income groups will also have a comfortable destination as the township will provide a mix for all,? said Bansagopal Chowdhury, state small-scale industries minister who is the chairman of the development authority. 

 The project will cost around Rs 350 crore. Work will be done in three phases and is expected to be completed in 2008. 

 The township will be able to accommodate more than 5,000 families. There are plans for building a modern club, spread over five acres, and parks and ponds.

 SembCorp is looking after the master plan, the detailed design and the engineering, besides being the project management consultant. 

 Bengal Shristi has already constructed Durgapur City Centre, a modern multi-facility and multi-utility urban plaza.

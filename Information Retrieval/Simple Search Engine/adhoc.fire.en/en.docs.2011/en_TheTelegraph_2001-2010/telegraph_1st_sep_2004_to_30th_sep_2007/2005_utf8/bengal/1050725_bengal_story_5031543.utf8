 Facility boost to tech town

 SANJAY MANDAL 

 Calcutta, July 24: The 

 best way to restore the crumbling infrastructure in the 

 states showpiece IT destination, the government believes, 

 is to pull in more industry. 

 For that, it will lease its own unused plots in Salt Lakes Sector V and allow companies to sub-lease their unused land.

 Space would be created for hotels with a special focus on infotech, which would offer and necessitate better facilities across the tech hub. 

 These hotels will have all facilities required for the IT industry, even hardware and software spares outlets, said P.R. Baviskar, the CMDA (Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority) chief executive officer.

 The CMDA will make a presentation tomorrow and after that we will finalise a plan to improve infrastructure in Sector V, which involves building the hotels, urban development and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya said. 

 Tenders will soon be floated inviting bids for the tech town plots.

 We have already issued the notice allowing sub-leasing of commercial plots in Salt Lake. Those not using portions of their land can sub-lease them after paying a fee, Bhattacharya said. 

 Baviskar said three-four plots have been identified. The projects will be implemented through public-private partnerships. 

 Along with the blueprint for a string of hotels, the government has drawn up a detailed plan to develop the infrastructure.

 Baviskar said: It does not just mean improvement of roads, drainage and street lighting but all other facilities necessary. 

 The industry, at various points, had pointed out the lack of facilities like good roads, drinking water supply, transport, proper drainage.

 Now, it is also stressing the need to improve the social infrastructure. There is a need for hotels and entertainment parks for professionals to unwind, said Joydeep Dutta Gupta, the director of PricewaterhouseCoopers. The entire supply chain has to be professional.

 According to Dutta Gupta, car-rental companies equipped with modern technology and Hindi-speaking drivers and good catering services are as essential as smooth roads. Any professional from outside should feel at ease with the place, he said. 

 Sector V continues to be of prime importance for us, said G.D. Gautama, the principal secretary of the information technology department. In spite of its saturation, Sector V continues to be the state governments showcase. It is the face of Bengals infotech for the outside world and we want to provide facilities of international standards here to attract more investment.

 Smoke screen for mangoes

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 A mango orchard: Breathe easy

 Calcutta, May 13: More than 60 brick kilns in five districts have been ordered closed by the pollution control board for the mango season.

 Three years ago, Badal Mandal, a farmer from Barasat in North 24-Parganas, had filed a public interest litigation in the high court alleging that the brickfields close to his orchard were proving hazardous for the fruits. Smoke and ash emitted by the brick kilns are very harmful when the trees begin bearing fruit. It will be extremely difficult for us to grow mangoes if these brickfields continue to discharge smoke and ash in the air, Mandal said in his petition. 

 The high court then issued an order saying that no brickfield will be allowed to operate within 1.6 km of the orchards. 

 Some brickfield owners, however, moved the Supreme Court challenging the order.

 Early this month, the apex court dismissed the writ petition. The board issued notices to the brickfields over the past week. For now, 64 brick kilns in North 24-Parganas, Malda, Murshidabad, Nadia and Hooghly will have to be shut down. 

 A senior law officer of the board, Biswajit Mukherjee, said generally, mangoes grow between February and May. We will not allow any brickfields within 1.6 km of any mango orchard during this period. Moreover, we will monitor all 3,500 brick kilns in Bengal and find out whether they have installed devices to control pollution, Mukherjee added.

 Harish Kumar Rahara, the president of the Bengal Brickfield Owners Association, said: Many of us have begun installing pollution control devices. He added that 14,000 people will become jobless once the brickfields are shut.

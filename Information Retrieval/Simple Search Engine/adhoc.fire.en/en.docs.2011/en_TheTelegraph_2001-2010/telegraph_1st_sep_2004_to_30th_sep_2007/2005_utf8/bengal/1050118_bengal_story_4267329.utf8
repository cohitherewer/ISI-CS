 Buddha bid to calm Ghisingh

 BARUN GHOSH

 Calcutta, Jan. 17: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s emissary, inspector-general of police A.K. Malliwal, called on Subash Ghisingh yesterday in a last-ditch effort to placate the Gorkha National Liberation Front leader.

 The move follows Ghisingh?s announcement at a rally in the hills on Saturday that he would not allow the elections to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council to be held unless an alternative to the autonomous council is worked out. Elections to the hill council have to be completed by March 26.

 ?We have information that Malliwal had already held one round of discussions with Ghisingh to persuade him to allow the elections to be held on schedule. But we are unaware of the details of the one-to-one discussion,? the CPM Darjeeling secretary, S.P. Lepcha, told The Telegraph.

 The GNLF chief?s threat not to allow the elections to the council to be held has again disturbed the peace in the hills, Lepcha said from Darjeeling. ?We have decided to maintain a safe distance from Ghisingh as Malliwal has been assigned to deal with the matter. We are hopeful that a workable formula will be arrived,? he said.

 The CPM leader said all four parties had decided to contest elections under the Save Democracy Front. ?All like-minded four parties have come together to fight Ghisingh?s autocracy in the hills and will put up candidates in all 28 seats,? he said.

 CPM leader Jyoti Basu today said the party would decide its next course of action after Malliwal, the IG (security) who is now in Darjeeling, returns. ?We cannot accept Ghisingh?s demand. I am waiting for the chief minister?s emissary to return to Calcutta. We will have to handle the matter carefully so that violence does not erupt again in the hills,? he said.

 Basu recounted that he was present with Ghisingh and then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi when the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council accord was signed at Raj Bhavan in 1988. ?Ghisingh was then very enthusiastic about the autonomous council,? he said.

 However, Basu fears that fresh violence may rock the hills if Ghisingh opposes the elections. ?More than a hundred party workers were killed in those days of violence. We don?t want it to happen again,? he said.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, the state Congress chief, said a tripartite meeting could be held with the Centre, the state government and the GNLF to sort out problems but without any preconditions. He also said the elections to the council have to be held, come what may.

 CPM eyes land in Trinamul bastion

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 Calcutta, Oct. 8: The CPM has begun identifying land for the Salim Groups projects in the Trinamul Congresss backyard, with an eye on the Assembly elections next year.

 Following stiff resistance from land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Molla, the MLA from Canning East since 1977, plans to acquire farmland from Bhangar in his constituency have been dropped.

 The party and the government have also decided not to target land in the constituencies of other CPM MLAs after most of the two dozen from South and North 24-Parganas ? the districts chosen for most of the Salim projects, which account for 53 seats ? said such an attempt could backfire in the polls.

 Im delighted to know that my well-nurtured garden, Bhangar, is safe from the invasion of outsiders, Molla said.

 The CPMs first provisional choice of site for the special economic zone proposed by the Indonesia-based group is 2,500 acres at Uttarbhag in Baruipur, represented by Trinamuls Arup Bhadra. In the last election, Bhadra had beaten Sujan Chakraborty, a favourite of the CPM leadership and now an MP, by five votes.

 Also on the radar are sites in Bishnupur (East), Bishnupur (West) and Sonarpur, represented by Trinamul MLAs Dilip Mondal, Nirmal Chandra Mondal and Subrata Bakshi. In North 24-Parganas, plots have been provisionally identified at Barasat and Rajarhat, Trinamul bastions represented by MLAs Ashok Mukherjee and Tanmoy Mondal.

 The segments ? 21 in all ? are also a cause of worry for the CPM and delight for Mamata Banerjee in parliamentary elections. CPM and Buddhadeb are openly targeting land in constituencies represented by my MLAs, the Trinamul chief said. Two factors are weighing most on their minds, the coming election and the resistance (to the Salim proposals) from within CPM. I am not going to let them have a free run on our turf.

 From Mamatas standpoint, the land acquisition will spell disaster. Just before the elections it will create cracks in her strongholds in the two 24-Parganas. Second, and more important, the special economic zone, township and four-lane highway will help the Left hold out job offers, the benefits of which it will reap all over Bengal.

 The sites chosen by the CPM cover nearly 55 mouzas in the two districts, of which about 40 are dominated by Trinamul. We run panchayat bodies, strings of local clubs and various other bodies here, said Mamata. Their selection cannot be a coincidence.

 Buying and selling of land has been frozen in eight mouzas in Bishnupur (East) ?Jagdihipur, Tongtola, Chandipur, Chowk Alalpur, Chakrabar, Dofagachi, Pirkhali and Bamangachhi. The ban is meant to keep the land mafia away, said Left Front chairman Biman Bose. 

 Once the party identifies the land, the government will take over. The land acquisition is scheduled for the year-end.

 There is no point shedding tears over what you describe as Trinamul bastions, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas said. The earlier everyone recognises that we need land for the Salim projects, the better. Trinamul is here today, it will not be there in another seven months.

 Wedding twist in rape bail

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Nov. 2: The high 

 court today granted interim bail to a rape accused after 

 the alleged victim said she loved him and they wanted to 

 get married.

 He (the rape accused) cannot fulfil his desire to marry me until the court releases him from jail, 19-year-old Rupa Biswas told a vacation bench.

 The resident of Duttaphulia under Dhantala police station said a wrong decision by her father Benugopal had prompted the police to arrest Sanjoy Bhattacharya. He is rotting in jail. Please release him so that we can marry.

 Minati Gomes, the lawyer appearing for Sanjay, 27, told the court her client was Rupas private tutor for the past three years. 

 They deeply love each other and had decided to marry. But her father was against their relationship.

 On September 26 this year, Benugopal lodged a complaint with Dhantala police alleging that his minor daughter had been abducted and raped by Sanjay. Subsequently, the police arrested Sanjay.

 As Rupas father was against the relationship, the couple had decided to elope and marry, Gomes said. 

 Rupa left the house but later returned, having decided to ask for her parents blessings for the marriage. 

 Rupas father took this opportunity and lodged a complaint against Sanjay, the lawyer said.

 Later, an ossification test proved that Rupa was not minor and is 19 years old. When she is willing to marry Sanjay, what is the validity of Benugopals complaint?

 Rupa, who was present in court, also narrated the facts to the judges. Gomes then handed over a letter written by Rupa to the court in which she appealed for Sanjays release.

 The division bench of Justices G.C. Gupta and S.K. Gupta told Gomes and additional public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami: When both parties have agreed to marry, then why the delay? We are granting an interim bail. You just ensure that the marriage takes place by December 14 this year. After the marriage, Sanjay will get a full bail.

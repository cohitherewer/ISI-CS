 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, May 23: A large police contingent had to lathicharge a mob this morning to rescue their colleagues, held hostage in a Nadia village since last night.

 The officer-in-charge of Murutia police station, Raktim Chatterjee, was among eight policemen locked up at Pepulberia, 190 km from Calcutta, when they went to stop construction work in a temple. Police said it was built on a disputed plot. When a CPM leader protested against the work yesterday morning, the villagers roughed him up. The leader lodged an FIR with the police in the evening. A police team visited Pepulberia late last night to stop the construction. As soon as the policemen arrived, the villagers pounced on them, snatched their rifles and confined them to a room. Chatterjee went to enquire about his colleagues around 1 am but, he, too, was held up. Tehatta subdivisional police officer K.P. Barui ordered the lathicharge today. Ten villagers were injured and 27 arrested. 

 Katwa: Amisha Bibis husband throttled her to death on Sunday allegedly because she was late in serving him dinner. Police said their neighbours at Haripur, 180 km from Calcutta, suspected murder, though Anwar Sheikh and his mother claimed that she died of illness. Anwar was tied to a tree and the police were called. He has been arrested.

 Burdwan: Over 1,000 women with brooms demonstrated outside the Katwa subdivisional office on Monday morning demanding release of Congress workers arrested during and after the municipal polls. MLA Rabindranath Chatterjee said they were picked up on false charges. The protesters blocked the Burdwan-Katwa road in the evening. As police lathicharged, brickbats were hurled, injuring 17 personnel.

 Cong tussle 

 Behrampore, Jan. 10: A no-confidence motion moved by Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury?s opponents in the party against Behrampore municipality chairman Nilratan Auddy fell through today. 

 While 12 Congress councillors of the faction-ridden civic body voted for Auddy, a Chowdhury loyalist, 10 Congress councillors owing allegiance to district party chief Atish Sinha backed former vice-chairman Pradip Nandy. The Congress had formed the board in December 2003 after winning all 23 seats. But trouble started last November as Nandy charged Auddy with irregularities.

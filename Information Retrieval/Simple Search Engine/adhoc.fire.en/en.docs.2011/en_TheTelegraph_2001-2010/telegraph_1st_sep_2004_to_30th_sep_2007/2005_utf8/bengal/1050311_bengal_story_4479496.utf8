 Unrest threat over hill panel

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ghisingh: Standing firm

 Calcutta, March 10: The Gorkha National Liberation Front today threatened the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government with ?dire consequences? if it sticks to its decision of appointing an administrator and does not make Subash Ghisingh the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council caretaker.

 Legislators Shanta Chhetri and Goulan Lepcha of the GNLF met Bhattacharjee in his Assembly chamber and urged him not to amend the DGHC Act to avoid tension in the hills. They submitted a letter to the chief minister saying the party wanted Ghisingh to be made caretaker of the council.

 ?The government will have to revoke its proposal to appoint an administrator. Our demand has the full support of the hill people,? said Chhetri.

 ?We have sent a copy of the proposed DGHC amendment bill to Ghisingh and the GNLF will finalise its course of action after its executive committee meeting on March 12. But we feel the hills will go up in flames if the government sticks to its decision to appoint an administrator,?? the MLA said.

 Bhattacharjee rang up Ghisingh again today after the GNLF leader announced a plan to organise bandhs in Darjeeling. State officials were tightlipped about talks between the chief minister and the Gorkha leader, but sources said Bhattacharjee sought his consent for the move to appoint an administrator to the council after its tenure expires on March 25.

 ?The chief minister tried to convince us about the need to amend the act and appoint an administrator, but we have made it clear to him that Ghisingh should be made caretaker of the council till a new body is formed through election,? Chhetri said.

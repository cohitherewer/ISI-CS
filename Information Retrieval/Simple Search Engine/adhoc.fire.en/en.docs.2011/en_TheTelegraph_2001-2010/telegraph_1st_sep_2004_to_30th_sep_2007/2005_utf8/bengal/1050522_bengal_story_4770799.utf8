 Bail denied in Sushil Pal murder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 21: The Howrah district and sessions judge today rejected bail to Biswajyoti Bose, the expelled CPM leader of Howrah who is the prime accused in the Sushil Pal murder case.

 Pal, a 45-year-old gynaecologist, was murdered in 2004 apparently after he refused to abort the child of a woman in the early stage of pregnancy.

 The bail petition was moved yesterday by Boses lawyer, when the nine accused in the case had appeared before the court for the fixing of the date of trial.

 However, the trial date could not be fixed as Calcutta High Court had admitted a petition by the state challenging the propriety of the order of charges framed by the then district and sessions judge Shyamal Chakraborty, according to the Howrah public prosecutor, Chinmoy Chowdhury.

 The judge had acquitted four persons because lack of evidence.

 The matter will now be listed on June 9.

 The state argued that Bose should not be given bail as the high court had already rejected bail petitions moved by the lawyers of two other accused in the case ? Suren Agarwal and Mamtaz Ahmed.

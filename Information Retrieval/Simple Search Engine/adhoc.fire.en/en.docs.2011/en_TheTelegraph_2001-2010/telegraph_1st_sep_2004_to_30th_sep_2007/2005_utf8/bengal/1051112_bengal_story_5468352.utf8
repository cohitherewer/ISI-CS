 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Nov. 11: CPM and Congress supporters fought a pitched battle in Mograhat this morning, two days after a CPM leader was shot dead in neighbouring Ushthi.

 Over a dozen people, including Akkas Babu, a CPM panchayat pradhan, were admitted to MR Bangur Hospital in Calcutta with gunshot wounds. The condition of three of them was said to be critical. Nine people were arrested from the war zone in South 24-Parganas, 70 km from Calcutta. Senior police officials are camping there. The trouble started over the possession of a 2-bigha plot. Two families supporting rival parties staked claim to it.

 Calcutta: A division bench of the high court rejected the bail plea of Abdus Sattar, a CPM leader of South 24-Par- ganas, on Friday. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life by the Alipore court.

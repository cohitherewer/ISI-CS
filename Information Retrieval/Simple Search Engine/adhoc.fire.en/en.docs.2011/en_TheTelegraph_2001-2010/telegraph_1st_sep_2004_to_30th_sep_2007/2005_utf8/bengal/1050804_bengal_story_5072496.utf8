 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Aug. 3: Nearly two months after being returned by kidnappers, 18-year-old Priyanka Mondol still lives in fear. 

 The boys who abducted me are roaming around our neighbourhood. It is difficult to venture outdoors, Priyanka said. They threaten and intimidate us regularly, added her father Habibar Mondal.

 Habibar and Priyanka went to Writers Buildings on Wednesday and met water resources investigation minister Nandagopal Bhattacharya, who promised action against the accused.

 Priyanka was abducted on her way to school on June 8. The gang left her near Kalambagan near Kundipur the next day around 4 am.

 Siliguri: On Independence Day, 14 post offices in the city and its suburbs will have new and restructured pin codes, beginning with 734 001 for the Siliguri head post office. After Calcutta, Siliguri is the second city in the state to get this restructuring and the third in the country since the pin code system was introduced on the 25th anniversary of Independence, when all metros and state capitals were given the 001 numbering.

 Calcutta: Four Left trade unions, including the Citu and the Aituc, has called a nation-wide general strike on September 29 in support of their 16-point charter of demands. State Citu president Shyamal Chakraborty said the strike was aimed at thwarting the Centres alleged move to impose a ban on our fundamental rights to call bandhs and strikes. 

 Barasat: A couple has lodged a police complaint against the womans father, saying he had threatened to kill her husband. Pramod Singh and Swati had married a few months ago against the wishes of Swatis father Podum Jaissawal, an Allahabad based trader. The couple also alleged that Podum has kidnapped Pramods elder brother.

 Calcutta: An officer of the Child Development Project was arrested on Wednesday from Dhamakhali in North 24-Parganas for embezzling around Rs 3 lakh. Police said Biswaranjan Ghosh had been evading arrest for a long time. Another person had been held earlier.

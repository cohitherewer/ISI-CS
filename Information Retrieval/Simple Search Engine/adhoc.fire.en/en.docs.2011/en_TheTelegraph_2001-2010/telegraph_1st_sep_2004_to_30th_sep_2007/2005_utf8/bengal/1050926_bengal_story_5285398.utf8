 Grades in school tests from 2006

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: In tune with the Union governments policy of assessing students with grades instead of marks, the Bengal government today said grades will be introduced in state-aided schools from the 2006 academic session.

 The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) had announced last week that it will replace marks with grades in its Class X examinations from 2008. 

 The state will first introduce the system in the schools internal tests ?terminal and annual examinations. 

 We will soon start sending circulars to the schools asking them to introduce grades ? along with the existing system of awarding marks, said Dibyendu Hota, the president of the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education.

 The board has almost completed the exercise of framing the structure on the basis of which the schools will be asked to assess students through grades. Along with grades, the existing system of awarding marks will also continue, Hota added. 

 The government has yet to decide from which year it will introduce grades in school-leaving examinations like the Madhyamik and higher secondary. 

 The government is keen on introducing the new system at all levels of school education ? primary, secondary and higher secondary, said school education minister Kanti Biswas.

 The government, he said, will abolish the system of awarding marks only after guardians and students of over 70,000 primary, secondary and higher secondary schools accept the new method whole-heartedly.

 He admitted that the grading system is no doubt more scientific and less stressful for students. 

 But added: We will abolish the old method only after the people concerned fully understand the benefits of the new system. That is the reason we are not introducing the grades directly in the board examinations. There should be no opposition at any level when the grading system is implemented.

 The board is also considering a proposal of the CPM-controlled All Bengal Teachers Association that it should award marks and grades simultaneously. It also wants students to be assessed through remarks like excellent, fair, good, bad or poor.

 The board will organise workshops involving guardians and teachers to work out a strategy on how to fix the grades.

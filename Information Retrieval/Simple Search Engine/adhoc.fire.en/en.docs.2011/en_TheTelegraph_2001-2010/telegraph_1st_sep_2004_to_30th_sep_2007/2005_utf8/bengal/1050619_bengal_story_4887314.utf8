 Bomb scare puts cops on toes

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, June 18: Hours after 22-year-old Kochi Mondal died in an explosion while making crude bombs on Panditya Road, there was almost a repeat of the incident at Chattubabu Lane under Entally police station.

 Mohammad Ismail, 40, who survived with injuries last night, was rescued and two persons were arrested. 

 The twin incidents have put police, apprehensive about the number of bombs in store for tomorrows polls, on their toes. We have stepped up our vigil and last-minute raids are on.... We will make sure that voters are not chased away, said Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of police (eastern suburban division).

 According to a report submitted by the election wing of the special branch to the police commissioner, there is a possibility of violence in at least 10 areas across the city. 

 Muchipara in central Calcutta and Narkeldanga in the east are listed as the most trouble-prone owing to the influx of outsiders, who have allegedly been hired for the day by local toughs. 

 Charges of criminals being brought from outside by political heavyweights flooded local police stations today, prompting senior officers to hold meetings with party representatives to allay fears.

 The sleuths will also have to keep an eye on areas under Lake police station ? Garcha Road, Hazra Road and Monoharpukur Road ? and Chetla police station in south Calcutta. These two are followed by Burrabazar, Jorasanko and Ekbalpur, where the contest is very close.

 The evaluation of the special branch matched that of the detective department. On Thursday night, the department seized 25 socket bombs from Kaizer Street under Muchipara police station, besides 250 grams of gunpowder from Ekbalpur. 

 The sleuths also swooped on Kalighat under Chetla police station, where 21 live bombs were found. 

 During an overnight search on Friday, the police found 236 bombs, 11 firearms and arrested 70 people from different parts of the city.

 Ranvir Kumar, the deputy commissioner of police, headquarters, said a tight security ring would be thrown around the city tomorrow. 

 There will be 18,000 policemen in the city and an officer of deputy commissioner rank will be in charge of two police stations. Among the 125 police pickets, 50 will monitor traffic movement. A joint commissioner of police will be in charge of each of the two divisions, he said.

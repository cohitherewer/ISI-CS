 HC notice to judge 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Feb. 16: Calcutta High Court today slapped a showcause notice on Asima Pal, the sub-divisional judicial magistrate of Serampore, and asked her to explain why she had passed an order contradicting an earlier ruling of the state?s apex court. 

 A division bench of Justices D.P. Sengupta and Arun Kumar Bhattacharya was taken aback when Sandhya Koley and Renuka Chakraborty approached them for confirmation of the anticipatory bail granted to them last month. 

 The duo had moved the bench in January fearing arrest for their alleged involvement in the death of Chaitali Chakraborty, a housewife, in Serampore. The bench, presided over by Justice Sengupta, had ordered them to surrender before the Serampore SDJM?s court and directed the magistrate to grant them bail. 

 Chaitali was found badly burnt in a bed in her in-laws? house in Serampore in 2002. She soon died but the unnatural death case did not make headway as her parents accepted it was an accident. 

 But her father lodged a complaint in the Serampore SDJM?s court this January, alleging his daughter was killed by her mother-in-law Renuka, sister-in-law Sandhya and husband Shibdas. 

 On February 3, when Sandhya and Renuka appeared before Pal in Serampore, she declined to grant their bail plea and said she ?wants to see them in jail custody till February 17?. The magistrate, however, did not categorically ask the police to send the two women to jail. 

 Confused, the duo again moved the high court bench. Today, lawyers of both the parties ? the petitioners and the state government ? narrated the whole story before the judges. 

 ?As per your order, both the accused had surrendered before the SDJM?s court but the magistrate declined to follow the high court?s directive,? a lawyer said. After hearing them, the bench issued the notice to Pal.

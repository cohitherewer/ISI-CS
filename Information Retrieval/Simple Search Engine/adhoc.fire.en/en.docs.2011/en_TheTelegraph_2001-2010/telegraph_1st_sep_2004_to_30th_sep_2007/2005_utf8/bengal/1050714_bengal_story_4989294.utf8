Bandwan, July 13: A scientific way of choosing 

base camps or hideouts and lack of co-ordination on the part of police administration 

are the key factors behind the growth of the CPI (Maoist) in Bankura, Purulia 

and West Midnapore.

 Apart from this, a section of police officers blamed absence of sophisticated gadgets in the police force for Saturdays Maoist strikes that claimed three CPM leaders and the officer-in-charge of Barikul police station in Bankura, Prabal Sengupta.

 After studying the entry and exit routes of operation s carried out by the Maoists in the past two years, the police have come to know that the attackers are always successful in giving them the slip because of the dense forest and knowledge of terrain.

 They know the terrain better than us. And keeping an eye on it is next to impossible. This time the assassins entered the area and returned through the jungle routes between Bengal and Jharkhand, said R. Shiva Kumar, Purulia superintendent of police.

 Elaborating on successful escapes by the Maoists, sources said: There is a list of specific directions mentioned in a periodical, Jung, published by the CPI (Maoist). And all the activists follow the instructions meticulously, right from selection of a base camp to daily lifestyle. 

 Senior officials of Bankura and Purulia police agreed that there was no intelligence report from Jharkhand police about the movement of the extremists active there.

 A special task force was formed involving the police officials of three states ? Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. But it has proved fruitless because of a communication gap between the officials of the three states. The attackers came from Jharkhand and our counterparts there should have collected intelligence about it, said an official. 

 We have no co-ordination problem with the districts in our state. But there is no positive response from our counterparts in Bihar and Jharkhand on sharing information, said another senior official of Bankura police.

 CPM ready with mayor reserve bench

 TAMAL SENGUPTA

 Bikash Ranjan: Fight ahead

 Calcutta, June 1: Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya is the CPM candidate for mayor, but the party has two standbys in place, in case the former Tripura advocate-general trips in the ballot battle for the civic reins.

 A panel of three mayor candidates is ready. It will take us a minute to announce our mayor if the peoples verdict goes against Bhattacharya, Anil Biswas, the state CPM secretary, told The Telegraph. 

 However, Bhattacharya tops our panel, he added.

 Biswas, who calculated Bhattacharyas poll prospects, expects him to win by at least 1,500 votes. ?And you know my calculations hardly fail, the politburo member said with a smile.

 He refused to divulge the names of the two others on the panel. They are also well-known and popular political persons, but I cannot give you the names, Biswas said. 

 Analysts said it could be embarrassing for the CPM if Bhattacharya loses. The CPM is almost sure about its victory in the June 19 elections. 

 Bhattacharya is in the fray in ward 100, won last time by the CPMs Buddhadeb Bose by around 1,100 votes. Bose was dropped this time to accommodate Bhattacharya. 

 The Trinamul Congress has fielded heavyweight MLA Partha Chatterjee, who defeated his nearest CPM rival in Behala during the 2001 Assembly polls by over 20,000 votes, against him. CPM insiders consider Chatterjee a strong candidate.

 The party is apparently working overtime to ensure Bhattacharyas victory, more so because he is perceived to be a not-so-known figure in Calcutta after being in Tripura for a long time. 

 Insiders said the leadership did not face such a situation when it projected Prasanta Chatterjee as a mayor candidate in 1985. He was known in party circles, particularly among ordinary workers and supporters. 

 Realising that Bhattacharya might find it difficult to sail through, the Alimuddin Street mandarins and key leaders in the partys Calcutta district committee have assigned Rabin Deb, the governments chief whip in the Assembly, to monitor election management. A 75-member booth committee and a citizens panel comprising 250 members have been constituted. Jyoti Basu and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee would be among those to address rallies for Bhattacharya.

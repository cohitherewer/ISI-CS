 Girls found after hill trip

 OUR BUREAU 

 Dec. 10: Manjusha and Lydia, the two students of Army Public School in Ballygunge who went missing on Thursday evening, were traced to a tourist lodge in Siliguri today. 

 Siliguri additional superintendent Tripurari said: The girls had checked in as Jessy and Daisy. After some initial resistance, they revealed their original identities.

 Around 6 pm on Thursday, Manjusha, a Class IX student, and Lydia, of Class VIII, were last seen at Turf View, the estate opposite racecourse that houses army officers. After that they were believed to have left for tuition classes. 

 Manjusha was in a black top and green jeans and Lydia in a red shirt and pink shorts. 

 Manjushas mother Sashikala said she could not see off her daughter on Thursday evening as she had to attend a meeting along with Lydias mother Aley Kutty. Both of them are attached to the Command Hospital as senior nurses and Sashikala is on her way out of the city after being transferred to Bangalore. 

 The girls had left with clothes suggesting that they had planned their trip in advance. 

 The Siliguri police said they had left home with cash and jewellery and reached Darjeeling yesterday morning. Having toured the hill town and spent the night there, they came down to Siliguri this morning. Around 10.30 am, they checked into the private lodge at Pradhannagar and called up a common friend in the city, who informed the parents and then the police. 

 The call came on her mobile phone. The police traced down the number and informed their Siliguri counterparts.

 A detective department officer said: Some of their schoolmates had told us that they were planning a Darjeeling trip. The girls have now left for home with police escorts.

 The mothers said they were relieved to know that their daughters were safe and added that they would not scold them.

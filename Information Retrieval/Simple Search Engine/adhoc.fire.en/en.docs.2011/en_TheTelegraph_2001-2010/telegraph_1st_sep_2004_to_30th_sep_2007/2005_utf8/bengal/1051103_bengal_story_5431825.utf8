 DA raise for govt staff 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 2: Government employees received a windfall today with the tight-fisted finance minister Asim Dasgupta announcing a four per cent increase in dearness allowance.

 The amount will be payable from December 1 to around 10 lakh employees, Dasgupta said.

 Among them are 4.1 lakh who are directly employed by the government, 3 lakh teachers, 30,000 non-teaching staff, 1.5 lakh employees of panchayats and municipal bodies, 70,000 from government undertakings and 40,000 from power sector undertakings.

 Around 4 lakh pensioners will also benefit from the allotment, which will cost Rs 112 crore annually.

 With todays announcement, DA for state government employees has risen to 59 per cent of basic pay. Central government employees get 71 per cent of basic pay as DA.

 From being a cash-strapped state in the late 1990s, Bengal now has a surplus of around Rs 2,600 crore.

 Dasgupta, however, played this down, saying: Financially, were doing marginally better than previous years.

 Officials said part of the surplus was on account of the Twelfth Finance Commission, which increased the share of states in the pool of central taxes from 29.5 per cent to 30.5 per cent, and revenue flowing in with the introduction of the VAT regime this year.

 Dasgupta also announced the sanction of Rs 175 crore in untied funds (funds that can be used for any project), of which Rs 139 crore would be provided to panchayats and Rs 36 crore to municipalities. 

 For the flood-hit districts, relief assistance was scaled up from Rs 115 crore to Rs 130 crore, while assistance for repair of irrigation embankments and river dredging in these districts was increased from Rs 65 crore to Rs 80 crore.

 The finance department will also make in advance the annual allotment of salaries for 3 lakh teachers and 11 lakh anganwadi workers as well as grants to institutions for the handicapped and those run by the backward classes welfare department.

 This is being done so that these salaries can be disbursed quickly. Earlier, government teachers were paid on the 15th of every month. Henceforth, theyll get their salaries on the 11th, he said.

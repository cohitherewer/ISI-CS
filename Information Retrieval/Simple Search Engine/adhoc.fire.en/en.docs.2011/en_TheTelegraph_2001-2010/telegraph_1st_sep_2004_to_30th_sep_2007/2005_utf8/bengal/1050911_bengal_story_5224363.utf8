 Parents stall sincere teacher transfer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Sept. 10: The management of a primary school in Nadia has declared the institution closed for six days since September 5 following protests by guardians of students over the transfer of the only male teacher.

 Authorities of the Adivasipara primary school at Shantipur, about 70 km from Calcutta, finally bowed to the pressure and announced the transfer of a female teacher.

 Guardians saw red on hearing of the transfer of Subrata Basak, the only male teacher at the school. They claimed that he is the only sincere teacher and they have no faith in the remaining two female teachers.

 The two lady teachers are not efficient. They come in late and walk out early. Basak is the only sincere one among them. We will not let the administration recruit any lady teacher after this, said Prashanta Sarkar, a grocer whose son studies in Class II.

 The school authorities gave in to the demands of the guardians but do not agree with them.

 We decided to cancel the transfer as studies are getting hampered, Bibhash Biswas, the chairman of the Nadia primary school council, said this afternoon. But we have not accepted the views of the guardians.

 Biswas has also asked a local school inspector to create awareness in the village about female teachers.

 Teachers at the school have also taken offence at the attitude of the guardians. The way the guardians have spoken about lady teachers is highly objectionable. Had we not taught the students well, they would not have got enrolled in the high school, said teacher-in-charge Basana Mukherjee.

 Basak, however, remained non-committal. I am ready to go wherever the administration sends me, he said.

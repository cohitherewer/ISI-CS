 Madarsa shut for minister

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Jan. 17: Five days ago, National Library authorities closed it to scholars for four hours because of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh?s visit.

 Today, the headmaster of the Marjampur Junior High Madarsa in Murshidabad declared that classes were over halfway through the day so that a programme to be attended by public health engineering minister Gautam Deb is a success.

 ?If I had not announced that classes were over, the minister?s programme would have been a flop,? said Abdul Qadir, the headmaster of the school in Beldanga area of Murshidabad, 180 km from Calcutta, and a CPM member.

 Deb had arrived at Marjampur to lay the foundation stone of a project to supply arsenic-free water. The playground of the madarsa was chosen as the venue.

 Qadir became enthusiastic about the programme and declared the madarsa closed for the day at 1.30 pm so that the 400 students could attend the function. The headmaster was joined in his efforts by assistant teacher Abdur Rezzak, also a CPM member.

 ?There was this programme that the minister who belongs to our party was supposed to attend. If we had not closed the school and taken the students to attend the programme, then not only would the programme have been a flop, my party leadership would also have served me a showcause notice,? said Rezzak. The teacher said seven classes are held on normal days but today students attended only four.

 Deb said at the ceremony that students from poor rural families are moving up in the merit lists of Madhyamik examinations.

 However, the local CPM leadership in Beldanga severely criticised the headmaster and the assistant teacher?s move to close the school for the minister?s programme.

 ?The madarsa authorities should not have declared the school closed. Rezzak and Qadir are our party members and we will inquire into the matter,? said Abul Kashem, a member of CPM?s Beldanga zonal committee.

 The teaching community in the district also came down heavily on the madarsa authorities Marjampur. ?The teachers of the madarsa are not members of our association. But, as teachers they have set a very bad example,? said Noor-e-Khoda, the secretary of Madarsa Teachers? Association in Murshidabad.

 Buddha in pollution cry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 31: The chief minister today called upon students and researchers of Jadavpur University to lay emphasis on creating technology that can help combat pollution in the city.

 ?Pollution is increasing at an alarming rate. We need new technology to save our city. Try to concentrate your research in the field of pollution,? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said while inaugurating a yearlong programme to celebrate the university?s 50th anniversary. 

 Pollution from industrial wastes and discharge of poisonous fumes from vehicles is virtually spinning out of the government?s control, the chief minister admitted. ?It is a matter of serious concern for the state government?the city will benefit if we get new technologies from Jadavpur University.?

 Bhattacharjee regretted that there has not been enough interaction between industry and the universities in the state. Most of the varsities, he said, have not been able to contribute to the development of industry in Bengal.

 On how university research can be helpful for the government, the chief minister said: ?My government is now laying a lot of importance on horticulture and also on development of agro-based industries. We can be self-reliant if our students in Jadavpur University carry out research in these areas and hand over new technologies to us.? 

 The chief minister praised Jadavpur for its achievements in all three faculties ? technology, science and arts ? within a short span of 50 years. The Centre has listed the institution among the five best in the country. 

 In his short speech, Bhattacharjee mentioned more than once that Jadavpur University is Bengal?s pride and he felt proud when people like Wipro chief Azim Premji praise its students. 

 ?Let me tell you, there are some very big investors who are keen to invest in Bengal because Jadavpur University belongs to this state,? he said. 

 He added that 50 per cent of Indian students working in companies across the world are from the state. ?And 75 per cent of these Bengalis are from Jadavpur University.? 

 It is the government?s responsibility, the chief minister said, to ensure that the best students from institutions in Bengal do not have to migrate elsewhere for jobs or higher learning.

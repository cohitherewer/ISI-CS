 Rs 40-crore plan for Sunderbans

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 4: About 400 km of roads would be built and over a dozen bridges erected in the Sunderbans delta spanning the two 24-Parganas.

 Officials said there would be at least 2.5 km of brick-paved road in over 190 panchayat areas after the Rs 40-crore project is completed in 2006.

 Nineteen blocks in Canning, Kultali, Patharpratima, Mathurapur, Joynagar, Gosaba, Lahiripur, Ballidwip and Kalasdwip in South 24-Parganas and Basirhat, Haroa and Hingalgunj in North would benefit. The Sunderbans Development Board will provide Rs 18 crore for the project while Nabard (the National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development) will give the remaining amount as a loan, Sunderbans development minister Kanti Ganguly said.

 Tenders have been floated for the construction of 200 km of roads. Bids for the remaining would be invited by December, Ganguly said. The bridges to be built include a 700-m one ? the longest in the riverine region ? at Dockghat in Canning. Over a lakh people travel to and from Sunderbans through Canning every day. 

 As part of the development drive, the minister said, the government will increasingly encourage farmers to grow cash crops instead of paddy.

 Rein comrades plea to Basu 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Calcutta, Jan. 12: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today arrived at Jyoti Basu?s doorstep with a request: ?Tell your communist friends to bear with us.? 

 Wrapping up his two-day tour of the communist stronghold, Singh visited Basu?s Indira Bhavan residence in Salt Lake this afternoon for a 40-minute one-to-one before leaving for the airport. 

 He urged the CPM veteran to rein in his comrades, who have been strafing the UPA government with friendly fire since it assumed power in May with their support. 

 ?We are strictly adhering to the Common Minimum Programme and during the last eight months, we have been working hard to implement the pledges in the programme to better the lot of people,? sources quoted Singh as telling Basu. ?Tell your communist friends to bear with us.?

 Only two days ago, CPM politburo member Anil Biswas told a party conference in Midnapore that the UPA government?s ?fall is inevitable if it continues to follow anti-people policies?. 

 The sources said Basu asked Singh not to be ?disheartened? by the criticism. ?We want the government to follow pro-people policies in accordance with the common minimum programme. And our job is to keep pressure on the Congress so that the CMP drawn up keeping the allies? interest in mind is properly adhered to,? Basu was quoted as having told Singh. 

 The former chief minister also made it clear to the Prime Minister that he wanted the coalition government to complete its five-year term. ?I know Singh for quite a long time. I am confident that the present government will run for five years under Singh?s leadership,? he said. 

 Basu said he had asked Singh to convene more meetings of the co-ordination committee to sort out controversial issues. ?I requested Singh to meet our leaders in Delhi on a regular basis,? he added.

 Common papers for primary exams

 - Glaring mistakes of teachers prompt change in Nadia

 RABI BANERJEE

 Krishnagar, Oct. 3: Alarmed over complaints pointing out dismal teaching in primary schools, the education authorities of Nadia have decided to set common question papers for the half-yearly and annual exams in the 2,500-odd institutions across Nadia.

 The chairman of the districts primary school council, Bibhash Biswas, admitted inquiries had revealed that the allegations had merit. According to governments policy, we cannot hold back any stu- dent at the primary level. We have to promote every one. But, at the same time, we want to ensure they are taught their lessons properly, he said. 

 Once the new system comes into effect this winter, Biswas said all primary schools in Nadia will have to conduct their half-yearly and annual exams using question papers prepared by the council. 

 This would be the first such effort in the state to ensure a uniform standard. The school authorities now set their own question papers. Scrutinising them, we have seen that the quality of question varies widely from school to school. While question papers of some schools reflected they have covered their syllabus adequately, others were found to have failed miserably, Biswas said. 

 The poor performance of some of the primary-level teachers came to light this January. Sasthi Pal, a Class X dropout, found that teachers at Dohradaha Primary School in Karimpur, 200 km from Calcutta, had marked right some glaring mistakes in his sons homework. The Class III student had divided 70 by 2 and produced 33 as answer. In English, he spelt ocean as ocian and Europe as europ. All the answers were marked correct. 

 Pal, a potter, lodged a complaint against all seven teachers of the school. 

 In August, Krishna Roy, 35, a rickshawvan-puller of Maj-dia, 110 km from Calcutta, found to his dismay that his son Chiranjit, a Class IV student, did not know how to spell his surname. When he asked younger son Bunty ? he is in Class III ? to write his name, he threw up his hands in defeat. 

 Krishna approached the authorities of Adityapur Primary School for an explanation. We were very worried. With my meagre knowledge, I found they could not spell most Bengali words from their books and were unable to read out a single poem. What has the school been doing?

 Biswas said: We want all primary students to answer the same set of questions because then we will understand which schools are lagging. 

 Biswas said the council would frame questions for all subjects ? Bengali, English, mathematics and environment. The schools will conduct the exams and evaluate the answer scripts. Copies of the report cards of each school will have to be submitted to the council. We will scrutinise the performance of all the schools and compare the report cards of their students to judge them and their teachers. 

 District magistrate Rajesh Pandey said: More teachers would be sent to those schools that perform badly because of lack of them. We will also know which school needs what ? infrastructure support or better teachers.

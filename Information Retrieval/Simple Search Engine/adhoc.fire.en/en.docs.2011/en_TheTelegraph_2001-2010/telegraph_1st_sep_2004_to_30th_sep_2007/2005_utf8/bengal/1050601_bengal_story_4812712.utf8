 GeneratioNext in poll pitch

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 31: A girl in a red T-shirt, standing against a shimmering background, lists Left Fronts gifts ? Science City, Millennium Park and Town Hall ? to the city and asks what the Trinamul Congress-led civic board has done for Calcutta in five years.

 The eye-catching but subtle poll pitch at the S.N. Banerjee Road-JL Nehru Road intersection announces how the front has embraced the latest marketing techniques in the old game of wooing voters.

 These billboards ? with fresh faces, smart copy and intelligent positioning ? have become a talking point in the run-up to the June 19 polls.

 It is true that we are using such a form of communication for the first time, says state party secretary Anil Biswas.

 Strategically placed ? a billboard near the AJC Bose Road flyover talks about the governments role in building the high road ? these messages, around 200 in number, are low on political rhetoric but high on day-to-day concerns.

 The smart packaging ? in Hindi, Bengali and Urdu ? has already started impressing the middle- and upper middle-class constituencies, traditionally known for their non-Left leanings. I have liked the messages. In a civic poll, issues matter, not political statements, said Rajesh Agarwal, a middle-aged businessman.

 The new strategy ? with focus on Citizen Gain by using representative faces and voices ? is a customised marketing effort, over and above the typical mass marketing strategy, feels market researcher Jasojit Mukherjee. The senior vice-president, IMRB, says an election is all about choices and parties want to woo voters just as companies fight for consumers mind space. With the aim being to reach out to people and communicating the message, political parties often use marketing tools to influence voters choice.

 BJPs India Shining pitch and SMS-based campaign before the Lok Sabha elections were also designed using techniques from the commercial world. It backfired. Aware of a possible backlash from its traditional stronghold ? the common man ? while trying to woo the urban voter, Left leaders are laying equal emphasis on traditional techniques like door-to-door and street-corner campaigns as well as graffiti.

 Our campaign revolves around voters and their issues. The billboards might be very visible because of their form, but we are equally stressing our traditional model, explains IT minister Manab Mukherjee, who, as a member of the CPMs Calcutta district committee, was among those who conceived the campaign.

 The leaders are tight-lipped about the costs. We purchased campaign material and supplied them to our workers, who prepared billboards, posters and banners, said Biswas. 

 While the leaders insist that everyone involved in the billboard blitz ? from photographer to model and copywriter to graphic designer ? is a party worker, unofficial estimates peg the cost of each campaign plank at Rs 3,000.

 With the CPM going vocal with vinyl, the Opposition campaign has been muted. 

 Pradip Bhattacharya, the state Congress working president, said the party could not afford to match it. We are offering only Rs 15,000 to our candidates for campaigning. 

 Trinamul has asked candidates to increase personal contact with the electorate instead of adopting hi-tech routes.

 Temple rules

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Tarakeswar, Nov. 12: The Hooghly district administration has decided to frame guidelines to rein in rogue pandas at the Tarakeshwar temple following complaints of harassment.

 District magistrate Vinod Kumar has called a meet- ing tomorrow with estate officials and the municipality chairman.

 Estate manager Mihir Kumar Bhattacharya said 111 priests would be given metal badges and 100 pandas would get photo identity cards. Notice boards will display the fees for offering pujas as well as bhog and prasad.

 The priests will have to deposit 20 per cent of the collection with the estate panel.

 Sikdar on return route

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 30: The BJP central leadership appears set to rehabilitate suspended leader and former central minister Tapan Sikdar in the state party unit and put him at the helm before next years Assembly elections. 

 The state BJP brass had earlier found him guilty of anti-party activities. But the central leadership, concerned over the partys abysmal performance in the last few elections, has given it a rethink.

 A party delegation from Calcutta called on party president L.K. Advani and the general secretary in charge of organisation, Sanjoy Joshi, in Delhi last week. 

 Asked about Sikdars possible comeback, Bengal BJP president Tathagata Roy pleaded ignorance. But those who went to Delhi with Sikdars case said the change in leadership was inevitable. Wait for a few months, you will see a revamped organisation in Bengal under Tapandas leadership, said Pratap Chatterjee, a former general secretary of the party.

 I have no problem taking over the reins of the organisation if the leadership wants me to do so, Sikdar said this afternoon, adding: A change of guard is necessary to stem the rot in the organisation?. We have not learnt much from our poor showing in the civic polls. 

 Sikdar was twice elected to the Lok Sabha from Dum Dum and had twice been the partys state president.

 Trinamul Congress insiders said the BJP central leadership intends to rehabilitate Sikdar as he has mended his strained relations with ally Mamata Banerjee. 

 Gone are the days when Sikdar refused to see her eye to eye. In the changed scenario, Sikdar has buried the hatchet with Didi to fight against the communists, a key Trinamul functionary said. He also pointed out that Mamata, unhappy with the present state BJP leadership, did not organise a joint meeting while campaigning for the civic elections. 

 According to sources in Mamatas party, Muzaffar Khan, a Sikdar aide who joined Trinamul ahead of the civic polls, worked overtime to bring the two leaders together. Khan is the working president of Trinamuls minority cell.

 BRIEFS

 Midnapore, Nov. 1: The East Midnapore assistant chief medical officer of health has been asked to go on leave apparently for moving against doctors who had been neglecting duty.

 Subrata Dutta, the chief medical officer, said Sankar Prasad Mandal should not have issued showcause notices to 11 doctors or transferred three medical officers in eight hospitals in Contai. The district is in desperate need of doctors to tackle enteric disease in the aftermath of the recent flood, Dutta said.

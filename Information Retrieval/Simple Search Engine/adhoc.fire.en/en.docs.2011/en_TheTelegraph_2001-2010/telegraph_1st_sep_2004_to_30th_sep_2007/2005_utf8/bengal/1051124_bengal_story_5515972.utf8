 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Nov. 23: A programme funded by the British government to strengthen panchayats and make them more accountable and participatory was launched here yesterday.

 Grants worth ?9 million have been sanctioned for the first phase of the programme ? named Strengthening Rural Decentralisation ? and might be raised to ?130 million, depending on how the funds are utilised and if targets are met in the first two years.

 Malda: A 16-year-old boy is believed to have been burnt alive as he lay asleep in his shop on Wednesday morning. However, Asraful Haqs family ? as are most residents ? is so terrified of Halim Sheikh, the man suspected to have killed the teenager, that nobody is willing to point a finger at him. The post-mortem result, too, states the death was accidental. 

 Krishnagar: Police on Tuesday night pasted a court order on the door of Krishnagar municipality vice-chairman Ashim Sahas house, declaring him an absconder in a murder case. The order asked Saha, a Congress leader, to surrender or face arrest. 

 Calcutta: The Election Commission has extended the last date for submission of applications for including names in the voters list to December 3, state government officials said.

 Calcutta: Five persons were arrested from Naihati in North 24-Parganas for allegedly beating up a 28-year old woman after tying her to a tree and cutting off her hair. Anita Sarkar, who works in a private nursing home, has lodged a complaint, saying her in-laws assaulted her.

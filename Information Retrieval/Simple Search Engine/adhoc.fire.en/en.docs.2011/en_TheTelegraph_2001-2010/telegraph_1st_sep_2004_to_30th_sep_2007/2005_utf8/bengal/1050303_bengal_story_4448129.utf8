 BRIEFS

 Chinsurah, March 2: Three children playing with a bomb which they mistook for a ball this morning were injured when it went off. Papai Dhar and Pronab Das, both five, and four-year-old Ashis Gandhi escaped with splinter injuries. 

 Police said they were playing at Sakherbazar ghat, about 14 km from Calcutta, when they saw the bomb lying on a step. As soon as they began playing with it, it exploded. 

 Midnapore: The Opposition Congress and Trinamul Congress complained that urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya particularly criticised the three municipalities they run in the East and West Midnapores during a review of 13 municipalities. He is believed to have cribbed that the Congress-run Midnapore municipality had failed to utilise government grants properly. The minister, they said, had words of praise only for the Haldia municipality, which is run by his party, the CPM. 

 Calcutta: The National Library has received grants to the tune of Rs 9 crore against Rs 4 crore last year for development projects. Director Sudhendu Mondal said he had approached Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for more funds when he visited the library this January. 

 Calcutta: Asim Nath, 47, the chief reporter of a Calcutta-based Bengali daily, died on Wednesday in a road accident in Delhi.

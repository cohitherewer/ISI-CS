 Malaise claims 8

 Malda, Aug. 30: Eight people have died of an unidentified disease in Englishbazar here in the past few days.

 The disease with symptoms like high temperature accompanied by body-ache, has affected hundreds in the district. More than 300 patients have been admitted to the district hospital here. 

 The hospital is so crowded (35 people were admitted this morning) that patients are having to lie on the floors and the veranda. We do not know how to tackle the situation. The strength of doctors and nursing staff is meagre compared with the number of patients pouring in everyday, said hospital superintendent Maniklal Das.

 The deputy chief medical officer of health, Subrata De, said: We have yet to identify the disease. Blood tests have not confirmed malaria or dengue. All those killed, but for a 40-year-old man, were between 13 and 20.

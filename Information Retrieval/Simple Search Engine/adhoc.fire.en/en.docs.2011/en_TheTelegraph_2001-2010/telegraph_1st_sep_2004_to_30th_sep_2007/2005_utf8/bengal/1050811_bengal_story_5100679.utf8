 Daughter sent to flesh trade, via dance bar

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Aug. 10: A man sold his daughter dreams of a better future and pushed her to the brink of a nightmare.

 Nemai Mundari, a poor farm worker at Dharampur village in Nadia, was arrested today on the charge of trying to sell his 14-year-old-daughter to flesh traders in Bihar.

 The incident is reminiscent of the case of Deepali Basak of Phulia in the same district, who had earlier this year traded off her 10-year-old daughter to Bihar to escape poverty and was arrested when she was planning to slap the same fate on her other daughter.

 Nemai, who with his meagre income of Rs 40-50 a day and many mouths to feed struggles to make ends meet, convinced his daughter Sabina that a career in the dance bars of Bihar would turn around the familys fortunes.

 According to police, Nemai got in touch with Namita Biswas, a former dancer in Bihars bars and a resident of nearby Huda village. 

 Nemai told Namita, who now fetches girls for flesh traders, that his daughter would accompany her to Bihar. 

 Namita had also lured five schoolgirls of the area with the promise of a ticket to Bollywood after a training in singing and dancing. Dream-struck, the students of Dharampur High School ? aged between 13 and 15 ? ran away from their homes to join Namita .

 The five girls and Sabina were taken to the house of Namitas associate Kajal Biswas in Huda, 20 km from Dharampur, on Monday afternoon. From there, they were to set off for Siwan in Bihar.

 At dawn today, hours before they were to leave, a police team, acting on a tip-off, surrounded Kajals house and rescued the girls. Namita and Kajal were arrested.

 Sabina broke down during interrogation and told the police that her father had told her to go and earn for the family, while the five schoolgirls admitted they were looking for a career in films.

 Namita and Kajal told us that we will receive intensive training in singing and dancing in Bihar and then we will become stars in Bollywood, one of the girls told the police.

 Nadia additional police superintendent Biswarup Ghosh said that after quizzing Sabina, a hunt began for Nemai. He was picked up an hour later from his house. 

 The man did not even tell his wife that he was sending their elder daughter to Bihar to earn money. He only told her that Sabina was being sent to a friends house in Bihar to learn sewing and how to make handicrafts, said Ghosh. 

 However poor he might be, he has no right to send his daughter to such an ugly trade. We have arrested him and will ensure that he, along with the other two arrested persons, gets exemplary punishment, he added.

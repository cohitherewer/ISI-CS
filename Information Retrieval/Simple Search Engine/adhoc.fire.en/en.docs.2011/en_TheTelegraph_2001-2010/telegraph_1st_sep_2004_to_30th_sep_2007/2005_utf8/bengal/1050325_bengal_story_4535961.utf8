 School menu spiced up

 RABI BANERJEE

 Krishnagar, March 24: About 1.25 crore primary students in 58,000 schools across the state may soon get to eat fish, meat or soya bean curry in mid-day meals. 

 The government has decided to better the meals provided to students up to Class V following Delhi?s decision to raise the allotment for every student from Re 1 to Rs 2.

 School education minister Kanti Biswas said the hike has widened the scope of the authorities serving the meals. 

 The first students to benefit will be in Nadia, where better meals will be provided from April. ?Gradually, the improved food will be served in all primary schools,? said Biswas.

 In Nadia, the authorities are busy drawing up the menu for 6.3 lakh primary students. 

 Bibhas Biswas, the chairman of the district primary school council, said the state had appealed to the Centre to increase the allocation for mid-day meals following complaints from parents and guardians regarding the quality of food served. ?Now that the allocation per student has been doubled, we will be in a position to serve better food,? he added.

 The meals, mostly khichdi or dal-bhat, would now be richer in protein. Biswas said: ?We are planning to serve nutritious items like soya bean, fish and, occasionally, meat. We will also try to serve an egg everyday.? Nadia is rich in vegetables and they could be there on the menu, too.

 Last month, parents of about 200 students of Ramakrishna-Vivekananda Primary School here, 85 km from Calcutta, wrote to district magistrate Rajesh Pandey urging him to exclude their children from the meal scheme. They said the children were used to eating better stuff at home. 

 The increased allocation, officials said, could also mean higher allowances for cooks preparing the meals.

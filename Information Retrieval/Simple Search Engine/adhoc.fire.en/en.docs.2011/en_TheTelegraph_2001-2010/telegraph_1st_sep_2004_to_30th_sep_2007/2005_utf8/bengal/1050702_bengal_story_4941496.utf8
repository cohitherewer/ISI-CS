 CM concern

 Calcutta, July 1: The chief minister today slammed a section of private hospitals for fleecing patients in the guise of offering packages. 

 There is lack of transparency in the dealings of some private health operators and this has to be controlled, he said at a programme on the occasion of Doctors Day. 

 The criticism comes when the government is spearheading a move to ensure increased private participation in healthcare. Sources said the chief minister had received a flood of complaints against errant nursing homes.

 Midnapore catch in Malda net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, May 23: A West Midnapore police team arrived, arrested a duo and headed home without giving their counterparts here the slightest inkling of the two-day mission.

 Jishnu Roy Chowdhury and Prasanta Das, in their thirties, were charged with having links with the February 25, 2004 blast in Belpahari, which had claimed eight security personnel. The landmine blasts were allegedly the Naxalites handiwork.

 Police sources said Jishnu is originally from Barasat, North 24-Parganas, but he grew up at his uncles place here. He was picked up from his rented house at Puratuli while Prasanta was arrested from Pakua in Bamungola. He is from the Phoolbagan area of Calcutta. 

 When news of the swoop trickled out, an outcry in support for Jishnu followed. Trinamul Congress leader Krishnendu Chowdhury said: We have known him for five years and he cannot be a Naxalite. He is a very good person who works for a reputed bank and is an excellent cricketer.

 Jishnus wife Sangita, who was with her father this afternoon, said: When I woke this morning, my husband was not around. Around 10 am, he called up to say the Midnapore police were taking him away. 

 Malda superintendent of police Sashi Kant Poojari, however, said he was totally unaware of the arrests.

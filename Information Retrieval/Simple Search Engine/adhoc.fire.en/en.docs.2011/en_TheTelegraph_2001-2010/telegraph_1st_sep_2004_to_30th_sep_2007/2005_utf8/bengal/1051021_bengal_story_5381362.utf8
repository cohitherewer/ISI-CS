 CPM brass count returns

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: The Trinamul Congresss protest aga- inst the investment drive is helping the CPM leadership in Delhi neutralise dissent in its ranks against Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees bid at reforms.

 In their last meeting, the party politburo and central committee gave Bhattacharjee the go-ahead to invite the Salim Group to the state. 

 Some Citu leaders, who did not agree with Bhattacharjee, earlier had to yield in the face of majority opinion in the decision-making fora.

 The perception in the CPM is that its leadership, both in Bengal and at the Centre, will close ranks behind Bhattacharjee if Mamata continues with her protests against the investment drive. It will also help the chief minister rein in protests from his comrades in the state.

 The CPM believes Mamata has set her sights on the Assembly elections. The need of the hour, its leaders believe, is to enter the poll fray with a united face and not racked by dissension.

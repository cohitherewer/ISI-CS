 Cell phone jam 

 Calcutta, July 19: The government will install mobile signal jammers in major prisons across the state.

 Biswanath Chowdhury, the jails minister, told the Assembly today that a tender has been floated to engage an agency to install the jammers in all central jails and other important prisons. The decision was prompted by a recent intelligence report that said high-risk convicts were using mobile phones to keep in touch with their gangs from the confines of their cells.

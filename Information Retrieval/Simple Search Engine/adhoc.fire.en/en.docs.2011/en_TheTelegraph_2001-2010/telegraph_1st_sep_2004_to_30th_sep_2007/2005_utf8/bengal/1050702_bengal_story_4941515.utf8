 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, July 1: A day after five people were arrested for killing 71-year-old Laxmi Sundaram at her Bishop Lefroy Rd home in Bhowanipore, sleuths recovered a bunch of US dollars which had been stolen from the apartment on June 9. 

 The notes were with a money changer on Sudder Street. We have not arrested the man from whom we recovered $1,200 but are checking his complicity, detective department deputy commissioner Gyanwant Singh said. Laxmi was gagged and dragged room to room by the assassins who forced her to open five almirahs. As the youths, who entered the apartment pretending to be courier boys, rummaged the chests, she gasped and died. An arrested youth, Raju Wilson, told the police he sold the ornaments for Rs 65,000. We are looking for the person who bought them, said an officer. Laxmis sons and daughters had said jewellery worth Rs 3.5 lakh was stolen. 

 Calcutta: CPI MP Gurudas Dasgupta said all Left parties will vote against the Congress-led government in Parliament if it tries to pass the pension regulatory authority bill with the BJPs support. CPM state secretary Anil Biswas, however, said no such decision had been taken.

 Calcutta: A computerised land registration office was opened in Hooghly on Friday as part of Writers Buildings e-governance initiative. People seeking registra-tion of their land can now get their deeds in an hour, an official said.

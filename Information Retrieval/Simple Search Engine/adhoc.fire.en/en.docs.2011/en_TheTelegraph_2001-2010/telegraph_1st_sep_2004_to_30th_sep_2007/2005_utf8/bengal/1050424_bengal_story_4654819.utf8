 Court rerun in uniting couple

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 23: Calcutta High Court has moved to unite a warring couple by ordering the husband and wife to stay together for a week to sort out their problems.

 ?Let us hope for the better. The judiciary is wishing you a happy and prosperous life. Try to understand each other. We want positive results after a week,? a division bench of Justices Amit Talukdar and S.P. Mitra told the couple on Thursday.

 Pranjal Chakraborty then went to Burdwan to spend a week at his in-law?s house with his wife, who had left the 30-year-old Delhi-based government employee seven months ago.

 The bench?s order comes close on the heels of the same court, a fortnight ago, sending Mithun and Deepanjana Das to a city hotel to stay together for four days. The duo later informed the court that they had decided to remain together.

 Pranjal moved an anticipatory bail petition after his wife Sanchari lodged an FIR against him in October under section 498A (cruelty and torture) of the Indian Penal Code with the Burdwan Town police station, alleging mental and physical torture by her husband when she stayed in Delhi with him.

 The 24-year-old said she had married Pranjal on January 31, 2004, and went to Delhi to stay with him. ?But, unable to bear his inhuman torture I left my husband?s house in October last year and came to my parents? house at Arya Palli in Burdwan,? Sanchari said.

 ?After the diary was lodged, the police started a case against Pranjal and he had no option but to move the high court seeking anticipatory bail,? said Ashimesh Goswami, the additional public prosecutor.

 On Thursday, Pranjal and Sanchari came to court with their fathers.

 ?During the discussions with the judges, Sanchari?s father broke down and asked the judges what his daughter?s fatewould be if the marriage fell apart. The old man?s tears moved the judges and they asked Pranjal to go to Burdwan and stay with his wife for seven days,? said Goswami.

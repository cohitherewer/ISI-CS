 Two held for aiding bank cash robbers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 23: The arrest of two persons has raised hopes of a breakthrough in the robbery of bank money on the Geetanjali Express earlier this month.

 On July 8, a group of armed men had barged into a compartment of the Mumbai-bound train and fled with Rs 99 lakh in cash. The money, which belonged to a private bank, was being taken from here to Jamshedpur.

 We have arrested two security guards from the agency that was assigned to protect the special containers. The guards had tipped off the robbers about the bank consignment. They carefully put the containers inside the train compartment and left. Now their role is known to us and they have also confessed to the crime, said Rajiv Kumar, the CIDs deputy inspector-general (operations).

 Three others from the agency were posted in the train to guard the boxes during the journey.

 The sleuths said the arrested duo ?identified as Mukesh Singh and Bablu Singh ? has given them all details of the operation, including the design of the two boxes in which the money was kept. 

 They knew about it because they were employed by the bank to guard the boxes, said a senior CID officer, adding that the robbers had been working on the guards weeks before the incident. 

 The robbers had reservations in the same compartment and were waiting for the boxes to arrive.

 They (the guards) escorted the boxes from the banks BBD Bag office to Howrah station and handed them over to another set of guards who were completely in the dark about the plans, said Kumar.

 The train had left Howrah on July 8 at 1.30 pm. Soon after it passed Kharagpur station, the gang got into action. They ran away with the boxes after pulling the emergency chain, CID officials said.

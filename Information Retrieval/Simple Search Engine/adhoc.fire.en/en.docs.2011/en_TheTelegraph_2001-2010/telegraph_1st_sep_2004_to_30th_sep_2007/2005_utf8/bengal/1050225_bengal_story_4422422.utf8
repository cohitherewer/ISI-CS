 Transfer tonic for dawdling dozen 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Mollah: Man on a mission

 Calcutta, Feb. 24: Abdur 

 Rezzak Mollah, the land and land reforms minister, kept 

 a group of officers outside his chamber for three hours 

 last week to show how they harassed people waiting endlessly 

 to meet them. 

 Today, he transferred all 12 employees of a land reform office, who hadn?t learnt from that lesson. The minister had been told told it had not opened till 11 am on a working day. 

 The dozen have been shifted to an adjacent block. ?The first jolt should be mild, I feel? so a transfer to the adjacent block seems okay for now. Departmental proceedings will follow,? Mollah said at Writers? Buildings today. 

 During a surprise visit yesterday, Dilip Chowdhury, the director of land records and surveys, waited for an hour from 10 am for the land reforms office in Purulia block I to open. It did not and he returned in a huff after putting a lock on it. 

 ?The door (of the office) remained locked between 10 am and 11 am. So Chowdhury, who spoke to me on the phone, bought a lock and key and put it on the door of the office. The attendance register, however, showed everyone in the office attends work on 10 am almost everyday. But the surprise check showed that the picture was different,? an angry Mollah said. 

 The minister has instructed all senior officials of his department to conduct such surprise checks at least 10 days every month. 

 ?I had asked Chowdhury that wherever he went on work, he should arrive at least the night before so that he could check any office he wanted early in the morning. This would show what kind of work was really going on in the various offices of this department,? Mollah he said. 

 The minister stressed on surprise visits to test the claim of some officers that they work sincerely. It was a reference to last week?s episode, against which they have protested. 

 Mollah had called them a ?bunch of thieves indulging in rampant corruption?. 

 He had created a flutter last year saying two departments, police, under the chief minister,and his own, were the most corrupt and known to harass people.

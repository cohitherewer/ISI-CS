 Calcutta, March 26: A 40-year-old businessman left his office for ?half-an-hour? on Thursday and has not returned since, says a staff reporter. 

 Police said Shrawan Kumar Shah showed no signs of stress when he left his Sreebhumi home around 9.30 am for his office on BB Ganguly Street in central Calcutta.

 After making several calls from office for over an hour, he left. ?I will be returning within half an hour,? Shah told Vijay Singh, with whom he has been running a plywood business for some years.

 On Friday, his brother lodged a diary with Bowbazar police station. The missing persons? squad is trying to trace the calls Shah made before leaving office. ?We are interrogating his business partners and friends... to find out if he was suffering from anxiety,? said an officer of the squad.

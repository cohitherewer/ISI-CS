 Molester tutor caught on camera

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 17: Waiting for hours, the father captured images of the private tutor molesting his daughter before handing him over to police at Girish Park late last evening.

 Nama Narayan Jha, 54, was charged with attempted rape on the basis of a complaint by Ajay Singh, who captured his moves on video camera following his six-year-old daughters allegations about her teachers behaviour.

 Jha was produced in a city court today and remanded in police custody for 14 days.

 It appears that he had been preying on the little girl for sometime. We have started an inquiry, said Uma Shankar Ojha, the officer-in-charge of the Girish Park police station.

 A native of Darbhanga in Bihar, Jha came to the city a few decades ago and used to offer lessons to local children. 

 A year-and-a-half ago, Singh asked him to teach his daughter, who had just been admitted to school. A Class I student, she would take lessons from him at her WC Bannerjee Road house six days a week. 

 A little over a month ago, she told her parents that her teacher was behaving strangely during class. The parents did not take her seriously. A few days ago, she refused to take lessons from him any- more, said a police officer.

 Yesterday, Singh decided he had to see it all for himself. A businessman dealing in video photography, he set up a camera in a corner to catch the teacher in his act. Around 7, he barged into the room when he could not finally bear to see his daughter about to be abused. The police were called and Jha handed over.

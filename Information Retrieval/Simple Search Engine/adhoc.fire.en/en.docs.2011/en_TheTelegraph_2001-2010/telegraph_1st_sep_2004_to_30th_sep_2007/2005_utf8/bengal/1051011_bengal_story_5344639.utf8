 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Oct. 10: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is sending Rs 1 crore from his relief fund to the Mufti Mohammad Sayeed government as assistance to the quake-ravaged Jammu and Kashmir. 

 In a statement released today, Bhattacharjee expressed his condolences for the bereaved and appealed to Puja organisers to come to the aid of the victims.

 Krishnagar: Over 300 villagers, some 200 of them women, protesting against the arrest of a Trinamul Congress leader, roughed up seven policemen and robbed them of their mobile phones on Monday. Kabul Ghosh, a panchayat samiti member of Charsambhunagar near Krishnagar town, about 95 km from Calcutta, was arrested for allegedly obstructing the construction of a primary school in the locality. A large police contingent rescued the seven who had been held hostage. Nadia police chief R. Rajsekharan said the police had to resort to a lathicharge to disperse angry villagers, who refused to let go of the officials. Twenty women were arrested.

 Calcutta: The bridge over the Kalnagini in Namkhana has been repaired, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said on Monday. An eight-foot section of the 70-ft concrete structure had collapsed on Saturday, throwing traffic in the area haywire. However, despite the repairs, plying of heavy vehicles has been restricted. Dasgupta also said that the flood situation in north Bengal has improved. Water levels of most rivers in North Dinajpur have gone down. 

 Calcutta: One person was killed when a tourist bus carrying 25 people from Rajasthan collided with a local bus near Gangasagar, 90 km from Calcutta. About all the others are now in various hospitals in South 24-Parganas.

 Chinsurah: Minister of state for education Iva Dey was injured when the car she was travelling in was hit by another at Serampore in Hooghly. The minister and seven of her relatives, however, only needed first-aid.

 Leaders on dais, party finds faults

 Calcutta, Jan. 23: The government today came under attack from a section of the ruling party at its South 24-Parganas conference.

 On the second day of the meet at Santoshpur, CPM functionaries criticised the government as well as the district leadership with Santi Bhattacharya at the helm. The chief minister and state party secretary Anil Biswas were on the dais when the firing began.

 At the inauguration of the 20th district conference, veteran leader Jyoti Basu had expressed displeasure at the tendency of a section of the leaders to ?impose? majority opinion.

 Today?s attack related to several issues, from the growing involvement of party functionaries in real estate and liquor licences to nepotism in appointment of primary teachers.

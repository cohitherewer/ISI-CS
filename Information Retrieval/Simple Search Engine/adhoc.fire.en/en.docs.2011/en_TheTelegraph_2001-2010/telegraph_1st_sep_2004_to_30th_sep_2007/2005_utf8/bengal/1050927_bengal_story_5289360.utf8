 Teacher axe rumour triggers war

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dhubulia, Sept. 26: Over 2,000 students and ex-students of a high school here in Nadia went on the rampage this afternoon enraged by a rumour of the suspension of a teacher.

 Five policemen and about 20 students were injured in the clashes that rocked the town, about 110 km from Calcutta.

 Shyamkamal Roy, the history teacher of Deshbandhu High School, had been showcaused by the management in February for allegedly abusing some new teachers following errors in the school magazine. 

 This morning, the news of his suspension spread like wild fire. Students of the senior section boycotted class. Former students flocked the school around noon, armed with sticks, scythes and rods. 

 They ransacked offices, including headmaster Haidar Ali Biswass, and smashed computers, furniture and windowpanes. Benches and blackboards were broken. National Highway 34 was blocked. 

 As a contingent from Dhubulia police station and adjacent Nakashipara moved in, the mob hurled brickbats. Outnumbered, the police sought reinforcements, burst tear-gas shells and wielded the baton. 

 Haidar Ali later apologised to the students for having showcaused Roy less than a year away from retirement.

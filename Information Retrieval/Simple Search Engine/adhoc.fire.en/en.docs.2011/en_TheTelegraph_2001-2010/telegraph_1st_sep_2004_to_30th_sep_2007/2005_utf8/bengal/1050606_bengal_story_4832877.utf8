 Power wise, party okays foreign purse

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 5: Its approach tempered by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees experience of governance and initiatives on industrialisation, the CPM leadership today said party-run states like Bengal and Tripura could accept money from international funding agencies like the IMF for development projects, but without conditions imposed. 

 As far as the states governed by the CPM are concerned, there should not be any difficulty in receiving foreign funding without any strings attached to such assistance, CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said.

 Our stand is clear, we shall not accept loans or assistance with conditions attached and the projects for which such assistance should be in national interest, Karat told a news conference at Alimuddin Street.

 His briefing marked the conclusion of deliberations of a three-day central committee session from June 3 ? the first after Karat took over as the CPM chief in April replacing Harkishen Singh Surjeet.

 An intense debate got underway in the central committee when members from Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and a few other states, where the party is not in office, put forth proposals to amend the document on economic and industrial policy to restrict the flow of foreign capital. 

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees position advocating the need for such development funds came into the deliberations. Also supporting the Bengal chief ministers view was his Tripura counterpart, Manik Sarkar. Their opinion, springing out of experience of governance and operational constraints, convinced the leadership of the need to allow a free flow of foreign capital in the changing political, economic and societal matrix.

 Though the resolution on development funds from international agencies was unanimously adopted, some states protested. We shall not restructure a factory by downsizing its manpower and production as a condition for taking such funds, a central committee member said. 

 Karat said a five-member central secretariat will assist the central committee in overseeing organisational network in five priority states ? Assam, Bihar, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand. While he will be in charge of Uttar Pradesh, Biman Bose, S. Ramachandran Pillai, Sitaram Yechury and Brinda Karat will look after Assam, Bihar, Maharashtra and Jharkhand. 

 The CPM chief asked the Manmohan Singh government not to proceed with its decision to sell 10 per cent of Bhel, terming it the first serious breach of the common minimum programme. There will be serious repercussions if the government goes ahead with its decision, he warned.

 The party, he added, has already conveyed its opposition to the fuel price hike.

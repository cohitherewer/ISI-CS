 6-year-olds throat slit

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, May 26: A schoolboy was murdered last night allegedly for dirtying the road in front of his neighbours house in Murshidabad, 250 km from Calcutta.

 Police said six-year-old Ruhul Sheikh, a Class I student of Malopara Primary School, went missing last evening. His body, with the throat slit and hacked with sharp weapons, was found this morning in a sugarcane field in Malopara village of the Jalangi area. It also had acid burns.

 The police have arrested Abu Taher Sheikh and his son Hafizul Sheikh ? Ruhuls neighbours ? on the basis of a complaint lodged by his father, Salam Sheikh.

 His parents searched for him at all probable places but could not find him. This morning, when Ruhuls father was about to leave for the police station to lodge a missing diary, villagers found the body in the sugarcane field, district superintendent of police, Sanjay Singh, said.

 Salam, who is a farmer, said he had a long-standing feud with his neighbours Abu Taher and his son. 

 Some people left some human excreta in front of their house yesterday. They alleged it was my sons handiwork. But I am confident my son was innocent. Then, I could not find my son from last evening. I could never imagine that they would murder my child for this, he added.

 Salam said Abu Taher and Hafizul had an altercation with him yesterday and they virtually came to blows over the incident but he tried to reason with them that his son was innocent.

 The superintendent of police said Salams elder brothers eight-year-old son Hashibul Sheikh had died an unnatural death early last month.

 His body was found floating in a pond inside a brick kiln in the area. We will inquire whether Hashibuls death had anything to do with the feud between the two families, he added.

 Liquor deaths

 Four persons died and one was taken seriously ill after they consumed spurious country liquor in East Midnapore district, 140 km from Calcutta.

 The victims, from Lalbazar village under Bhupatinagar police station, had consumed the brew at a neighbours house on Wednesday on the occasion of Manasa Puja. The person who organised the puja has been arrested.

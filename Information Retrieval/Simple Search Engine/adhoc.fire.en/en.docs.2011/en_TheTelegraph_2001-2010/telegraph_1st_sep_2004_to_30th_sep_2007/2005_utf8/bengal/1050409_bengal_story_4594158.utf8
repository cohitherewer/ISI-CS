 Probe lapses free lifer

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 8: Calcutta High Court today acquitted a person sentenced to life in a murder case, holding that the prosecution had failed to prove him guilty.

 ?The investigators did not bother to have the murdered man?s body identified by his family members,? the division bench of Justices A.K. Basu and P.K. Deb said.

 The lapses on the part of the investigators helped Sheikh Sirazul, a resident of Memari in Burdwan district, to be released from jail after seven years.

 Sirazul?s lawyer, Rabi Shankar Chatterjee, had in the high court challenged the order passed by the Birbhum additional sessions judge in 2000 finding Sirazul guilty of murdering neighbour Sheikh Ansar and sentencing him to rigorous life imprisonment.

 On September 9, 1998, Sirazul and Ansar had gone to Tarapith with neighbours Bandana Dutta and Jahanara Bibi. The quartet had rented rooms at the Nagen Babu Ashram.

 The next day, Sheikh Ansar was found dead in a room at the ashram. Police sent the body for post-mortem without identifying it.

 The post-mortem report revealed that the deceased had been strangled to death. On receiving the post mortem report, the Tarapith police arrested Sheikh Sirazul, Bandana and Jahanara.

 The interrogation of the accused indicated that Ansar was the victim of a triangular love affair. ?During interrogation police came to know that Sirazul had an affair with Bandana. But Bandana had developed a relationship with Ansar. When Sirazul came to now about it, he decided to kill his rival,? according to police records.

 Sirazul chalked out a plan and arranged a trip at Tarapith, according to case records.

 On the midnight of September 9 he went to Ansar?s room to have a few drinks with him. After a few drinks, Ansar became senseless. Sirazul then strangled him to death and returned to his own room.

 After a two-year trial, the additional sessions judge of Birbhum acquitted Bandana and Jahanara but sentenced Sirazul to life.

 The convict?s lawyer submitted, during the hearing of the appeal in the high court, that police could not impose murder charges on a person until the body of the victim was identified by his family members.

 ?If Ansar?s body had not been identified by his family members, how can the police say for sure that it was the same person who developed a relationship with Bandana? Why did the investigating officer send the body of the victim for post mortem without having it identified by Ansar?s family members?? asked the lawyer.

 The lawyer appearing for the state told the court that there was enough circumstantial evidence to prove that Sirazul is the killer.

 However, the division bench allowed Sirazul?s prayer and directed the police to set him free.

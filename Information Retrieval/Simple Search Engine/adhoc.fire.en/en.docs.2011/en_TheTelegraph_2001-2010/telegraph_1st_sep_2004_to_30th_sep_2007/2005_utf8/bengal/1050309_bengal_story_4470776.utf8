 Governor gets cops going

 OUR BUREAU

 March 8: It needed the governor?s prod to make police sit up to a commoner?s plight.

 A report on the alleged rape of a 14-year-old visually-challenged girl, published in the Sunday edition of The Telegraph, drew Gopalkrishna Gandhi?s attention.

 Hours after the governor called up home secretary A. K. Deb to enquire what the police were doing, 15-year-old Madhu Biswas was held. 

 On Friday night, he apparently sneaked into the girl?s house at Matiari near Krishnagunj, 110 km from Calcutta. Her mother was then sleeping in an adjoining room and father Shyamal Biswas, a fisherman, was away. 

 Shyamal returned home the next morning to find his daughter lying almost senseless. She was bruised.

 Gopal Gandhi said: ?I was shocked by the news item and asked the district administration to probe the incident. The act is doubly outrageous as the girl could not see? It is a heinous crime.? 

 District officials said medical reports did not suggest rape, but added in the same breath that the girl underwent the medical examination almost 48 hours after the incident ? after the governor?s call and the boy?s arrest. Madhu has been remanded in 14 days? judicial custody. 

 In December, a visually-impaired girl of 19 was allegedly raped by two local youths at her home in the same district.

 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, July 28: Sheikh Nasiruddin, who had abused a five-year-old girl three years ago, was sentenced to seven years imprisonment by the Salt Lake juvenile court today. 

 A resident of the Tangra area, Nasiruddin had committed the crime in March 2002, when he was 16. He visited the girls home when her parents were away and lured her to a closed tannery. There, he abused her for over two hours. Profusely bleeding, she returned home and re-counted the trauma she had been through, said an officer of the Tangra police station. Public prosecutor G. Chakraborty said: Medical tests had confirmed that the accused had violated the girl. Nasiruddin, who appeared composed while entering the court, broke down on hearing magistrate Durga Khaitan Das pronounce his verdict. 

 Krishnagar: Kanailal Dutta, 50, who ran a nursery here, hanged himself inside his shop on Thursday, apparently unable to cope with competition. His son lodged a complaint with police charging the owner of another nursery in the locality with pushing him to suicide.

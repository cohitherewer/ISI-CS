 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, March 27: The fate of Great Eastern Hotel?s 400-odd employees will be decided tomorrow when the government reviews the impasse over its privatisation.

 Members of the Great Eastern Hotel Authority managing committee will discuss the scenario arising after the employees? deadline to accept the early retirement scheme (ERS) expired on Saturday. No employee has yet accepted the scheme. ?Let them make up their mind on what they want ? displacement without compensation or an ERS that provides retirement and other social benefits,? a public enterprises department official said.

 In Britannia Industries, the government last year stopped paying the salary subsidy after the staff rejected the ERS. Consequently, when a fresh ERS was offered later, a majority of the employees went for it. 

 Howrah: Pankaj Kumar Pathak, 24, of Bally, who left home on Saturday saying he was going to play Holi with friends, surfaced on Sunday in a pond in Liluah, 2.5 km away. The boy preparing for his CA finals was described as ?quiet? by family and neighbours. 

 Siliguri: Tea traders here have decided to go on a strike from Monday. They are protesting against the alleged harassment in the hands of commercial tax sleuths .

 Purulia: Three children have died in six days and 53 people have been afflicted with chicken pox at Hushendi village in Jhalda. Health services director Prabhakar Chatterjee said medical teams have been sent to the village to ascertain if the children died of pox or measles.

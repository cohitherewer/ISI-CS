 Relief in sight, but school goes

 Jalangi, Aug. 8: After living for a month under leaking tarpaulin sheets, 400 families of two villages in Murshidabad, who saw their home and hearth being devoured by the raging Padma, are seeing rays of hope streaking in. 

 The administration has woken up to the need to rehabilitate the residents of Paraspur and Taltali, the two villages that are no more. 

 Last week, the Padma was flowing 15 metres from the primary school building at Paraspur in Jalgai, about 260 km from Calcutta. The school was washed away this morning.

 Over 2,000 people from the two villages have been forced to take shelter in the tarpaulin tents set up by the administration on adjacent farmlands.

 However, a more decent living is on the cards as the authorities have announced a Rs 10-crore project to rehabilitate the displaced villagers.

 We have already identified a 13-acre plot at Chak Rajarampur, 4 km away. But it will not be possible to accommodate all the homeless in one village. Those who do not find place at Chak Rajarampur would be shifted to the other side of the river. The rehabilitation will begin after monsoon, said N. Manjunatha Prasad, district magistrate, said today. 

 He said the area has been in the grip of severe erosion since the first week of July. Altogether, 387 houses have been washed away. After the monsoon, we will take up a Rs 11-crore project to prevent erosion.

 But many lives have already changed forever. Nishikanta Hazra, who owned 100 bighas of agricultural land apart from mango orchards and a coconut grove in Paraspur, has seen all his assets being eroded. This year, his ancestral house, the last resort, also went into the Padma. Once an affluent farmer, Hazra was forced to live in the refugee tent until his daughter took him to her in-laws at Sagarpara, far from the river.

 Abul Kasem, a small farmer of Paraspur, has lost four houses in the past five years.

 Records available with the administration say the erosion along the western bank of the Padma and the Ganga (it is the same river called differently at different places) started as far back as 1931. Since then, the river has eaten up at least 35,600 hectares. The Padma has move 9 km inland over the past seven years.

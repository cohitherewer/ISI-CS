 Fourth murder in contract race 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, July 22: A gang of four stormed the house of a trader early this morning and pumped four bullets into him as his wife and three children looked on. 

 The miscreants threw Anaul Halsanas wife, Parveen, to the ground when she tried to resist. Attracted by her cries and that of the children, between four and seven years old, residents of Fasilnagar, about 190 km from Calcutta, rushed in to find the CPM supporter lying dead on his bed. 

 The murder of the 32-year-old trader was apparently a sequel to rivalry over bagging a contract to operate a ferry service across the Jalangi. 

 Police said Anauls was the fourth murder in a year in the run-up to the bidding for the ferry service, which yields a profit of Rs 30,000 a month.

 Anauls elder brother, Golam, was among the three killed earlier. RSP district committee member Mohsin Mondal, a potential bidder, was also shot dead. Nuzbul Sheikh, a CPM supporter, was gunned down last month after he decided to participate in the auction. 

 The murders over the ferry service is becoming a major concern for us, Nadia additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh said.

 The contract is to be awarded through a public auction slated for next month. Anaul, like his brother, was expected to bid for the contract, the police said. The highest bidder yet had had to pay Rs 50,000. About 2,000 people use the ferry every day to cross the river for Murshidabads Domkol. 

 This morning, four men stood guard in front of Anauls house during the murder. Before fleeing, the police said, the gangsters hurled bombs to scare the neighbourhood.

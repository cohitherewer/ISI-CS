 Minister lays bare health warts

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, July 6: Corruption is plaguing the healthcare sector ? the admission today came from the ministers mouth.

 Surjya Kanta Mishra told the Assembly there is no doubt that rackets and paying illegal commissions exist in the sector.

 Referring to the murder of Ranaghat surgeon Chandan Sen, Trinamul leader Saugata Roy had earlier said: There is an unholy nexus and greed corroding the entire system.

 Mishra said the state has no immediate plans to install modern machines like CT scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or keep provisions for advanced pathological tests in district hospitals. He admitted that there is a dearth of experts to handle such machines. 

 Replying to a question tabled by leader of the Opposition Pankaj Banerjee, the health minister pointed to the lack of competent doctors in district hospitals to handle specialised treatment. 

 We have plans to upgrade district hospitals. But it is not immediately possible for us to introduce CT scan, MRI, ultra-sonography and dialysis facilities in every district hospital, he said.

 According to norms laid down by the World Health Organisation, hospitals equipped with machines for modern tests must have adequate doctors and experts capable of handling complicated cases. But most of the district hospitals do not have such expertise, the minister said. 

 Nearly 70 per cent patients admitted to state-run hospitals are offered free treatment, Mishra told the Assembly. He added that no other state offers healthcare to so many people. Government hospitals cater to 80 per cent of the population? in other states, healthcare is shared equally between the private sector and government.

 The minister said that though there has been commercialisation of health, the government is committed to supporting the poor. We cannot stop commercialisation of health if we want to, he added.

 According to Mishra, the number of people heading to other states for treatment has also come down. He cited Tata Memorial Hospital as among the several centres of excellence being set up in the state. 

 The minister admitted that there is a need for expansion of the private sector, but added that it has to be accountable. It is for this that the Clinical Establishment Act has been passed and we have taken action against a number of nursing homes and closed down many others?. It is not possible that there wont be any control on the private sector, Mishra said.

 CM bid to end hotel impasse

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 29: As the standoff between unions adamant about stalling the privatisation of Great Eastern Hotel and the government drags, back-channel negotiations appeared to have begun with the chief minister stepping in.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee took up the responsibility to bring around Intuc leader Subrata Mukherjee while public enterprises minister Nirupam Sen spoke to Citu leader Rajdeo Goala this evening. 

 Mukherjee, also the mayor, had a round with Sen as well.

 Tourism minister Dinesh Dakua admitted that the government has sounded Goala and Mukherjee on the issue. ?The two union leaders are supposed to get back to us with their opinions. We are waiting for their feedback,? Dakua said at Writers? Buildings. 

 Mukherjee stuck to his tough stand in public. ?I want protection for a section of the employees, who are below 50 and who, I feel, should be re-deployed elsewhere,? he said.

 Over 150 permanent staff in the hotel are below 50.

 The mayor said he clarified his stand to Sen, also the commerce and industries minister. ?The minister said he will get back to me on this demand,? claimed Mukherjee.

 Goala, however, denied having spoken to either Sen or Bhattacharjee. ?We maintain that more talks should be held with the workers,? he said. 

 The government has been in a bind since the 400-odd employees? deadline for accepting the early retirement scheme expired on March 26 without anyone applying for it. Officials are especially worried as the government has to inform the UK?s department for international development (DFID) about the response to the scheme by Thursday.

 Dakua, who had earlier said the hotel will die a natural death if the workers reject the ERS, today again said March maybe the last month when the staff will get their salary. ?It is not clear whether budgetary provisions have been made for the payment to the employees in the coming financial year.? Great Eastern, Dakua added, incurred a loss of Rs 5 crore last year.

 Danger lurks at home for girls

 PRONAB MONDAL

 Calcutta, Aug. 13: Women beware, the beast is on the prowl, and at home.

 Over 95 per cent of the rape accused in the city in the last few years have targeted women who either belong to their families or those they have been acquainted with.

 The startling statistics, which emerged from a survey conducted by the city police, have also revealed that children and teenagers are most prone to sexual assault ? 98 per cent of the victims are minors.

 We have conducted the study on the basis of the complaints lodged by the victims families. During the course of our investigation, it was found that the victims knew the accused from before the incidents took place, said Gyanwant Singh, the deputy commissioner (I) of police, detective department.

 Singh had asked the departments womens grievance cell to carry out the survey to list the reasons behind torture on women. Officers visited the victims families as well as homes of the accused. 

 The survey echoed the National Commission for Womens findings on Crime against Women in Bengal last year that had said most rape accused are related to their victims. 

 In almost all the cases, we found the tormentors were distant relatives of the complainants families and had access to the victims houses, said an officer of the womens grievance cell. 

 We found a grocery shop-owner and a milkman among the accused who took advantage of access to the girls houses, she added.

 On what prompted the police to conduct the survey, Singh said: Initially, we were going through records to track down the places where rapes had been committed. Our search revealed that most of the crimes took place in rooms in and around the girls neighbourhoods. Immediately, we decided to look into it thoroughly.

 While the majority of victims are below 18, the predators are mostly in the 18-35 age group.

 Most of the victims were minors and they were trapped by the men from their known circle. In some cases, the accused targeted children aged between 6 and 10 and lured them by showing a piece of a chocolate or ice-cream, said an officer who worked on the survey.

 Singh has a word of caution for couples with young children. Most of the accused are beasts in the garb of friends. They know the victims families. So, please beware of them and save your child.

 Principal assaulted

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Krishnagar, Feb. 23: Student union members of Pannadevi College in Karimpore clashed in the office of principal A.K. Haque this morning and allegedly beat him up and ransacked his chamber when he tried to intervene. 

 Members of the students? wings of the Congress and the Trinamul Congress fought with students loyal to the CPM?s SFI, which took control of the union yesterday, over selection of the general secretary. 

 Police arrested 28 activists of the Trinamul Chhatra Parishad and Chhatra Parishad. At least 10 students have been admitted to a hospital in Karimpore, where the two groups have called a 24-hour bandh tomorrow. 

 Trouble started when the losing groups demanded election of the general secretary through secret ballot. The principal allowed the SFI to select the general secretary as it had bagged the majority votes in Tuesday?s union election.

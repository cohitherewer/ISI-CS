 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Feb. 27: Transport minister Subhas Chakraborty today called the CPM-run Bidhannagar municipality ?ineffective?.

 The minister, who has left the party red-faced earlier, said: ?The civic body does not work... I shall intervene in its affairs from day after tomorrow to set things in order.? After attending a meeting of temporary stall-owners in Salt Lake, he said the township?s master plan has been flouted many a time and they have to be probed. Last year, his name was associated with gangster Dilip, who was held for a shootout.

 Contai: Actor Arjun Chakraborty?s speeding car was mistaken for dacoits? as vigilantes at Jankabazar here raised a hue and cry and hurled stones on Saturday. The actor, returning after a jatra over 200 km from Calcutta, told police his driver was hit. Six of the night-guards were held.

 Calcutta: Sampa Haldar, 19, of Mandirbazar, South 24-Parganas, who was to appear in HS 2005, hanged herself on Saturday. Her parents had objected to her affair.

 Midnapore: Dipak Mirdha, 19, was held on Sunday from Fuleswar village in East Midnapore for allegedly raping a six-year-old. An artisan, he worked in her house.

 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, July 13: The principal of a state-run college in Kalyani today put in his papers before the college governing body following a spat between teachers and students over allotting a room to house the students union.

 Students belonging to the SFI-affiliated union last Monday forcibly occupied the teachers room saying they had not been given a room by the college authorities. The teachers objected and refused to move to another room offered by principal Harisadhan Dey Adhikari. The principal then allotted a room to the union and restored the staff room to teachers yesterday. But teachers refused to occupy it and demanded that the students apologise. When the students refused, the principal resigned.

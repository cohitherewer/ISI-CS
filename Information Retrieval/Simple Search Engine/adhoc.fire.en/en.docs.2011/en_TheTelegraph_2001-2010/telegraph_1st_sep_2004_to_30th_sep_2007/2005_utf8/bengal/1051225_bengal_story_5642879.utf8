 Alert over wires in CM way

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Purulia, Dec. 24: Police today found a network of wires embedded in the earth on the Purulia-Barakar road which will be taken by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on his way to Purulia tomorrow.

 Police officials said the wires could be connected to explosives planted by CPI (Maoist) guerrillas. The culvert under which the wires were seen is located in a deserted place 3 km from Raghunathpur town.

 Bhattacharjee will visit Para in Purulia, 220 km from Calcutta, to address a public meeting. The chief minister will reach Asansol by train and travel by car to Raghunathpur. He is expected to reach Para around 2 pm.

 We dont know if there are any landmines underneath and are waiting for the expert team. We have stepped up security along the chief ministers route, said Jogesh Chatterjee, inspector-general of police (headquarters) in charge of law and order.

 Calcutta, Dec. 17: Mamata Banerjee will share a platform with L.K. Advani at a Trinamul Congress convention tomorrow, signalling that the party will not sever ties with the National Democratic Alliance despite overtures to the state Congress for an electoral understanding.

 However, defence minister and state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee, who was also invited to attend the convention of Trinamul Youth Congress workers at Netaji Indoor Stadium, will not be present.

 BJP sources said Advani called up Mamata today and requested her to strengthen the electoral tie-up with his party in the run-up to next years Assembly elections.

 He also met state BJP leaders and asked them to settle intra-party differences.

 Congress sources said Mukherjees absence from tomorrows programme would send a message to those desperate to forge an electoral understanding with Mamata despite her links with NDA.

 Key party leaders like former state Congress chief Somen Mitra and general secretary Shankar Singh and former mayor Subrata Mukherjee have said an electoral understanding with Mamata is the need of the hour to oust the communists from Bengal.

 Advani, who is on a visit to the city, went to Belur Math this afternoon, his 10-car convoy reaching there around 3.45. Senior monks welcomed the BJP president.

 Accompanied by his wife, Advani went to a temple on the Math premises and paid homage at statues of Sri Ramakrishna and Swami Vivekananda. 

 He also visited Sarada Math and Swami Vivekanandas house.

 The BJP chief refused to comment on political issues. Please do not ask me any political questions here, he told reporters.

 Asked about Sourav Gangulys exclusion from the Indian Test team, he said: No comments.

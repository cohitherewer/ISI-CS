 Party brunt on woman

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Nov. 1: A woman, abandoned by her husband and trying to eke out a living on her own, was driven out of a Murshidabad village four months ago for not paying Rs 100 as puja subscription to some CPM supporters.

 Aparna Mondal, 32, who had studied till the higher secondary level, once gave private tuition to children at Senai village in Burwan, 250 km from Calcutta, and sold saris in the neighbourhood. She now works as a domestic help in Behrampore town.

 The members of a local club ransacked her cottage before driving her out and destroyed her Madhyamik and HS certificates. Burwan police neither protected her nor moved on the complaint filed four months ago. 

 The CPMs local committee secretary, Ananda Ghosh, accused Aparna of polluting the environment of the area. 

 The woman, abandoned by her husband eight years ago, has now lodged complaints with district magistrate N. Manjunatha Prasad and superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh. We have received the complaint. The officer-in-charge of Burwan has been asked to carry out a thorough probe, Singh said.

 Aparna married Bhuban Mondal 12 years ago. But our relationship soured and he walked out. I left Paikpara and came to live in Senai (4 km away), where I set up a small thatched cottage, she said. She had also set up a self-help group with 10 housewives and was planning to set up a poultry farm.

 Anima Mondal, who was part of that group, said: The CPM leaders are speaking ill of Aparnadi, but she has taught us to be self-reliant. We were about to launch the poultry farm when she was thrown out of the village.

 The members of the club raided my house and threw out my belongings when I refused to give Rs 100 for Manasa puja. They destroyed my certificates and threatened to kill me if I returned, Aparna said.

 None of the accused has been arrested.

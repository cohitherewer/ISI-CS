 Father in court for sons torture

 RANJAN LAHIRY

 Burdwan, Dec. 26: Virtually abandoned by his son, an 82-year-old man has moved court for maintenance.

 Sanjiv Ghosh, who had a tailoring shop, and his wife Sheela, 75, once lived peacefully in their small, single-storey house at Telmarui in Burdwan town, 115 km from Calcutta. 

 Their elder son Prasanta, 57, a BSNL engineer posted in Calcutta, pressured Ghosh for money even after taking Rs 1 lakh in 1996 and finally forced him to sell off the house last year after promising to take care of them. 

 When they went to live with their elder son, the Ghoshes were made to feel like misfits. We were kept under lock and key and his wife was rude? she gave us only two meals a day. She also mentioned that we could not match up to their status? they will lose their prestige if people visiting them saw us, Ghosh said.

 His younger son Susanta, 54, a kidney patient who sells saris door to door, rented a flat in the town after his father sold off his house last year. 

 The old man got Rs 1 lakh from the house and split the amount between his sons. He is penniless now.

 In late 1996, when Ghosh sold his tailoring shop for Rs 3 lakh, he gave Rs 2 lakh to Susanta for treatment and Rs 1 lakh to Prasanta for his house. 

 He shifted to the new house, not far from where his parents lived until last year, with his wife and daughter in 2000. 

 This August, Prasantas parents fled his house and went to a friend near Burdwan station. How long could we stay there as guests? After a week, we left. We slept under shades at night and the people of the town took pity on us and gave something or the other to eat.

 Late November, an NGO located them and contacted their sons. Apparently embarrassed, Prasanta rented a one-room flat for his parents and arranged home-delivered food. 

 On December 23, Ghosh moved the chief judicial mag-istrates court seeking maintenance. 

 Prasanta said: My parents have moved court. I will only say what I have to in court. The case will be heard on January 4. 

 Ghoshs wife Sheela was unwilling to level charges against Susanta. He is sick and earns only Rs 1,500 a month. How can he take care of us?

 The Telegraph had reported a string of similar incidents last year. In one of them, Sukumar Shau, 74, was thrashed by his son Shyamal, who wanted him to sell a plot valued at Rs 5 lakh. Three cases have been reported this year.

 Madhyamik result phobia wreaks havoc 

 OUR BUREAU

 Krishnagar/Behrampore, May 29: With the Madhyamik results knocking at the door, panic has gripped students across the state, driving one to death and forcing four to run away from home. 

 Sixteen-year-old Priya Pramanik hanged herself last night at her home in Shantipur in Nadia district, 70 km from Calcutta, a few hours after watching the news on television. 

 Police said Priya, a student of Sarat Kumari Girls School, had a heated debate with her mother Bela after she fought with her elder brother and sister. 

 Priya had not done well in her exams and her elder brother and sister taunted her in front of other members of their joint family. They told her she would fail and Priya lost her temper, said additional superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh.

 Bela was furious with Priya and gave her a sound thrashing. In a fit of rage, Priyas mother also warned her that she would be treated badly by everyone in the family if she returned home with poor marks, said Joydeb, Priyas father. 

 Ghosh said Priya then locked herself in her room. Around 10 pm, Joydeb, a weaver, came home from work and Bela went to call Priya for dinner. But there was no response. 

 They called their relatives and broke open the door to find Priya hanging from the ceiling with her dupatta around her neck. The body was sent for post-mortem, Ghosh said. 

 In Murshidabad, four Madhyamik examinees of Bagar High School have been missing since May 22. 

 Subir Pramanik, Arup Konai, Papiya Pradhan and Uma Ghosh ? residents of Bagar Ghoshpara in Nabagram, 220 km from Calcutta ? had left home saying they were going to Umas relatives house in Behrampore.

 Their parents lodged a complaint on Thursday after a hunt for them ended in vain. 

 We have found out in our preliminary investigation that all four have fled home fearing they would fare poorly in the Madhyamik exams. However, we are also probing whether there was any love affair involved, said Sanjay Singh, the Murshidabad superintendent of police.

 The four had only about Rs 450 with them, the parents have told the police.

 My son is not familiar with places beyond Behrampore. He also told us that he felt he had not done well in his exam. Whenever we discussed the results and how he would fare, he panicked, said Joydeb, Subirs father.

 Papiyas father Bidhan said he was certain that fear of failure had forced his daughter to run away.

 Doubt damper on Asim road race

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 1: Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, who has been inspecting roads for the last couple of weeks, today assured that temporary repairs of all stretches having tram tracks would be completed by October 5.

 However, officials said this was a tall order as work on two major roads is yet to begin and rains have been hampering repairs.

 Dasgupta spent three hours yesterday inspecting roads and the progress in the construction along tram tracks. 

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury, additional commissioner of police (I) Goutam Mohan Chakraborty, DC (traffic) Javed Shamim and officials of the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) accompanied him.

 Repair work of all (stretches with) tram tracks will be complete by October 5. I cant say theyll be thorough repairs, but the roads will be made navigable, the finance minister said.

 But some officials, who did not want to be named, hold a different view. 

 Work on some stretches is yet to start. These include Nirmal Chandra Street and BB Ganguly (Bow Bazar) Street. Also, the progress of tram track de-reservation on Rash Behari Avenue and at the Gariahat intersection is not encouraging. It will take at least 10 days more to make the road motorable, said an official who accompanied Dasgupta.

 It is also feared that rains could delay the project. Given the weather forecast, rains next week could send our schedule haywire, the official added.

 However, the mayor was optimistic. Tram track repairs are making good progress. Weve asked HRBC to complete repairs by October 6. The condition of roads has improved greatly, he said.

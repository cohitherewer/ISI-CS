 Rerun of child rape in Nadia

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, April 8: A 13-year-old boy was arrested today on charges of raping a six-year-old, in the third incident of teenage rape in the district since February.

 The girl, a resident of Shikarpur village in Nadia, 200 km from Calcutta, was severely bleeding and was admitted on Sunday night to Karimpur hospital.

 The incident comes about a month after a 15-year-old school dropout was arrested on March 5 on charges of raping a 13-year-old. A month before that, on February 9, Jahangir Sheikh, 15, was arrested for raping a girl three years his junior in Karimpur.

 On Sunday evening, the girl?s parents were away, according to the subdivisional police officer of Tehatta, K.P. Barui. Soon, Abul Sheikh, a neighbour?s son and a Class V student of Shikarpur High School, entered the house to play with the girl and her 10-year-old brother.

 After some time, Abul gave the girl?s brother some chocolate and sent him on an errand. ?The boy then dragged the girl to a nearby a brick kiln, in a deserted area about half a km from their house, and raped her,? said Barui. The boy fled and the girl returned home bleeding.

 Saiyad and Minu were horrified to see their daughter bleeding profusely and took her to the Karimpur hospital. However, the father did not inform the police at first fearing adverse publicity for her daughter.

 The child was later referred to the Shaktinagar district hospital in Krishnagar as the bleeding did not stop.

 ?As bleeding could not be stopped, her haemoglobin level has also plummeted,? said the doctor attending her.

 Unable to bear his daughter?s agony any longer, Saiyad lodged a complaint with the police last night. ?She shivers even if her mother touches her,? said Saiyad.

 Abul was arrested this morning and police officer said the boy has confessed.

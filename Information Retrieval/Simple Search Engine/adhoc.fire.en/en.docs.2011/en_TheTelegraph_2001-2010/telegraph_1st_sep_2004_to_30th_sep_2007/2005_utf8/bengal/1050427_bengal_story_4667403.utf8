 ?Love link? in murder

 Barasat, April 26: Police officers probing last night?s murder of Suman Basu, a third-year IT student of the B.P. Poddar Institute of Technology, believe that a triangular love affair led to the killing. 

 Suman was on a motorcycle in Barasat when shot by miscreants around 10.30 pm. 

 ?We have seized a mobile phone from Suman?s friend Biswajit Roy. Suman had made his last call to him at 8.15 pm. We are questioning him for details about their friendship,? said North 24-Parganas police chief Praveen Kumar. 

 Suman allegedly had an affair with a law student, Sagarika, who lives in Kaikhali. An officer said: ?He went to a restaurant with Biswajit and Sagarika last evening. They went home after that while Suman headed to Haritala in Barasat to chat with friends.?

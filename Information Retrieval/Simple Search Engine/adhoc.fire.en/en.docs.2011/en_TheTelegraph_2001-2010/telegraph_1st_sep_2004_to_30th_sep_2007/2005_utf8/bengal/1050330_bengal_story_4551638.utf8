 Monk trio in cash case net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, March 29: CID personnel arrested three monks of a mutt in Nabadwip this morning for allegedly siphoning funds of an NGO controlled by another mutt they were previously associated with. 

 Police said Satyananda Brahmachari, Kamalapati Brahmachari and Nityagopal Brahmachari of the Keshabji Gouriya Math in Nabadwip, about 100 km from Calcutta, were picked up on the basis of a complaint lodged by the Debananda Gouriya Matt. 

 The monks, who were in charge of Bedanta Samiti, an NGO under the Debananda mutt, quit a year ago and established Keshabji Gouriya Math. ?We were suspicious and initiated a probe, which revealed the misappropriation of money,? said Acharya Maharaj, the mutt chief executive.

 An officer of the Krishnagar wing of the CID said Satyananda, Kamalapati and Nityagopal were held in the compound of their new temple, built about six months ago. 

 The trio was accused of siphoning at least Rs 28 lakh as they failed to explain the expenditure incurred by the NGO.

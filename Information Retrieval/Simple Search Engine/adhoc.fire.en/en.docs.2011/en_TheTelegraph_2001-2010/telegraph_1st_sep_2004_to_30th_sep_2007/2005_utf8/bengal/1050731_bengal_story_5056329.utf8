 Row over school promotion policy 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 30: The 

 Bengal government has rejected the proposal of the United 

 Progressive Alliance government that a system be introduced 

 to promote every student till class XII.

 We are happy that some of the controversial recommendations of the 2000 curriculum are not there in the present National Framework of Curriculum of School Education. But we are strongly against a recommendation in the present framework that suggests the state governments introduce a system of not detaining any students till class XII, school education minister Kanti Biswas said after a meeting organised to review new draft.

 The draft proposes that school boards hold public examinations at the end of class 10 when the examinees should be awarded a school-leaving certificate, but says no student should be detained.

 Under no circumstance are we going to accept this because it would mean that the first time a student would be detained is when she/he appears for the class 12 examinations, the minister said. It will be difficult to maintain proper academic standards by abolishing pass-fail system till class XII.

 The new framework does not mention compulsory teaching of Sanskrit, which the NDA government had pushed.

 The Centre had set up a 37-member committee to formulate the new framework. The new draft has been framed taking into considerations the reports of the 21 subcommittees set up to examine various areas in school education, like examination system and girls education.

 The National Council for Educational Research and Training, in charge of framing the final curriculum, recently asked state governments for their opinions on the draft framework.

 Todays meeting was organised by the state government to take the opinions of people concerned on the framework and was attended by 15 organisations of schoolteachers, NCERT director Krishna Kumar from Delhi and senior officials of the education department.

 We will send our views to the NCERT soon, Biswas said.

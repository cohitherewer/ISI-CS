 Party raid on Ghani home

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Malda, May 29: Veteran Congress leader A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury was gheraoed by his own men today.

 Hundreds of Congress supporters stormed the Malda MPs Kotwali residence to protest against the partys decision to support a Trinamul Congress chairman in the Englishbazar municipality. 

 District party president Ruby Noor, who is also Ghani Khans sister, had issued a statement yesterday that the Congress would not oppose the Trinamul if it selected a chairman.

 Perched atop pick-up trucks, mini-buses and cars, more than a thousand Congress activists, half of them women, arrived at Ghani Khans house at 5.15 pm.

 The protesters were led by district working president of the Intuc ? the Congresss labour wing ? Kaji Nazrul Islam. Biswanath Guha, a claimant to the chairmans post and also an Intuc leader, was, however, conspicuous by his absence.

 Ghani Khan was in one of the ground-floor rooms, when slogan-shouting Congress supporters surrounded his house. We want Biswanath Guha as the civic chief, We will not allow the chairman to be from the Trinamul Congress and Down with the Trinamul were some of the slogans that rented the air. The supporters also hurled abuses at former chairman Krishnendu Chowdhury.

 Ghani Khan tried in vain to pacify the agitators. The absence of Ruby Noor made matters worse. 

 Unable to stem the shouting, he finally announced: I have not made any commitment about who should be the Englishbazar chairman. I have only said we will join the Trinamul Congress and form the board. Nominations for the post is still open.

 I have heard your grievances and after I discuss the issue with senior party members, I will let you know about our decision. The move will be in accordance with the present situation. Please return to your homes now, the leader appealed. The protesters left Kotwali at 6.30 pm.

 Ghani Khan later told reporters that he was upset over Biswanath Guhas recent claim to the post of the chairman.

 I never mentioned anything about the post. The person will be selected only after discussions between the parties involved in forming the board, he said.

 The Congress leader said the people who had come to gherao him had finally understood his stand and left after seeking his blessings.

 Despite the Congress leaders claim, the Intuc, however, is firm on getting Guha nominated as the chairman. 

 Guha said he would abide by his partys decision.

 Eve-tease ire on outsiders 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, July 22: Outsiders are a problem not just on the Presidency premises.

 People who did not belong to the North Bengal University allegedly passed lewd comments at an economics student and her friend on the campus yesterday and beat the boy up when he protested. 

 Later, during dinner, the goons came to our hostel and threatened us, said a student of geography. We then decided to inform the authorities and headed for the vice-chancellors residence. But on the way, youths on motorcycles intercepted us and beat us up with bottles, rods and belts worn by the universitys security personnel. The students, who alleged a nexus between the outsiders and the guards, beat up security personnel and smashed one of their vehicles.

 This morning, when VC P.K. Saha and registrar T.K. Chatterjee reported for duty, they found rooms locked. The staff refused to open them to protest against the students violence, said Dilip Sarkar, the controller.

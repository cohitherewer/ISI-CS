 Cooch Behar simmers again

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Cooch Behar, Oct. 15: Leaders of the Greater Cooch Behar Peoples Association today threatened to launch a fresh agitation if their demand was not taken up with the Union home ministry at the earliest.

 Leaders, including association general secretary Banshibadan Barman today addressed a 5,000-strong rally at Prantik Bazar under the Dinhata police station, about 525 km from Calcutta.

 Accusing the district magistrate Ravi Inder Singh of double talk, Barman told the gathering that they had withdrawn the indefinite hunger strike after three days on September 23 following an assurance from Singh that he would discuss the matter on October 15. But today, we have found that Singh has cheated us. On September 23, when we had asked him to give us his assurances in writing, he had said he would not go back on his word. But he has backtracked, he said. 

 On September 20, when thousands of association supporters marched to the outskirts of Cooch Behar town defying prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the CrPC to join the hunger strike, the mob turned violent and attacked policemen. Five persons, including Kalimpong additional superintendent of police, Mushtaq Ahmed and two other policemen were killed. 

 The district magistrate had requested association members to withdraw the hunger strike with an assurance that he would meet them today. 

 But as yet no letter or even verbal communication has reached us regarding a meeting with him. This is a black day for us as we have been betrayed by the administration on this day, Barman alleged.

 While Singh, when contacted from Calcutta, refused to say anything on the matter, state home secretary Prasad Ranjan Roy said tonight he would look into the matter.

 Barman, amid cheers from the crowd, said they would shortly form a council of ministers to govern Cooch Behar. The sooner we will be able to form the ministry, the better for the people of Cooch Behar as the government is least bothered about our welfare, he said.

 The erstwhile rulers of Cooch Behar never signed a treaty that made the state a part of Bengal. According to the treaty, the state should be ruled by a council of ministers appointed by the Centre, Barman said.

 Asutosh Barman, cultural secretary of the association, told the rally that a high-level committee from the Union home ministry would shortly visit the district to study the demand for statehood.

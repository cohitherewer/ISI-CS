 Report fuels foul-air probe by government

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 9: The state public vehicles department (PVD) will conduct an inquiry into the functioning of all auto-emission testing centres in and around the city.

 In view of the report published in Metro today on the malpractice at Pollution Under Control (PUC) centres, we have decided to commission an inquiry. Action will be taken against those found guilty, PVD director H. Mohan said today.

 Metro today reported how a polluting diesel-driven vehicle had obtained Grade-A emission certificates from two PUC centres, one in north Calcutta and the other in Howrah. No tests were conducted on the Tata Sumo, which got a clean chit from both the centres. A proper test at the third PUC centre pegged the emission figure at 79.7 Hartridge Smoke Unit, way above the permissible limit of 65 HSU.

 Action was taken today at one of the rogue centres. Tushar Sen of Sen Service Station in Salkia, one of the PUC centres found issuing false certificates, said: I had no idea about the malpractice. After reading the report, I checked and found irregularities in the system. We have suspended the guilty workers and have stopped pollution check for diesel vehicles.

 On a day government and private agencies were gearing up for a damage-control exercise, auto-emission petitioner S.M. Ghosh, whose six-year case was disposed of yesterday by a high court bench on the basis of information that PUC centres across the city had been computerised, added to the controversy.

 In a letter to his lawyer, Samarjit Ghosh, he wrote: Neither did I instruct you to withdraw the petition, nor did I say that computerised auto-emission testing centres were working properly. 

 The lawyer said he would clear his position in court on Monday.

 The petitioner also drew attention to the loopholes in the existing emission-check system. According to my information, around 50 per cent of the PUCs in the city practice corrupt methods. There are 115 centres in the state, of which around 70 are in Calcutta.

 Sudipto Bhattacharya of SAFE, an NGO carrying out a clean-air campaign, said: It is unbelievable how farcical the entire business of auto-pollution checking is in the city.

 Officials of companies that supply pollution-control machines and software to centres are busy passing the buck to others. Pradeep Kumar Banik, regional manager, AVL, said: We have heard about the malpractice and I think at least half the PUCs in the city indulge in it. Our machines are tamper-proof but some other companies are helping the centres manipulate the system.

 No amount of blame game can deflect attention from the authorities apathy in ensuring clean auto-emission checks . The monitoring panel overseeing PUC centres has not met since December 2004. Police, too, have discontinued mobile pollution checks ever since the computerised method was introduced in October.

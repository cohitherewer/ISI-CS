 Airport finger at roadroller mishap

 When will the lights shine?: A plane takes off in low visibility from Dum Dum airport. 

 Calcutta, Jan. 22: Preliminary investigation into yesterday?s dark spell on the Dum Dum airport?s main runway has pointed finger at a road roller involved in the installation of Instrument Landing System Category II on the strip. 

 ?Preliminary investigations suggest that a road roller had caused damage to the cable. This was an accident and there was no sabotage,? said airport director Rajendra Paul. 

 However, officials said they were trying to pinpoint those responsible for the accident. ?All persons related to the work of the runway were interrogated through the day and a detailed report has been sent to the aviation ministry,? said a senior Airports Authority of India official. Those who did not follow the standard operation procedure will be pulled up, he added. 

 On Friday, the main runway could not be handed over for operations at 5.30 pm after day-long work on the new landing system as officials discovered to their horror that the lights along the strip did not come on due to damage to a cable. 

 The Rs 18-crore project involves putting in place bright lights along the ?centre line of the runway?, making it easy for pilots to land in poor visibility. Work on the project started last year and Paul said they are ?planning to complete it by this June?. 

 As the main runway is the only strip that can be used after sundown, flight schedules went haywire on a busy evening. As operations came to a standstill, a repair team began checking the 232-km cable inch by inch to trace the fault. 

 The lights finally came back on at 8.10 pm and normal functioning was resumed around 8.30 pm. 

 In the meantime, several flights had to be diverted while some circled in the sky. The plight of a Lufthansa Airlines cargo flight, from Frankfurt to Chennai and Calcutta, seemed to have been the worst. 

 The plane was scheduled to land at Calcutta at 6.30 pm. ?Since there was an emergency in the airport, the plane was circling in the sky,? said an airport official. 

 The pilot was first asked to land at Dhaka, but later diverted to Chennai. But the flight, carrying more than 100 tonnes of cargo, was short of fuel and so the pilot did not want to go all the way to Chennai and continued circling in the sky. 

 But the hours stretched and things were yet to be normalised. Finally, at 8.30 pm, soon after the lights came back, the plane made an emergency landing with fire engines on standby for any emergency. 

 ?If it could not land in a few more moments, there would have been a major crisis,? sources in the air traffic control said.

 Cop hurdle in girl-sale case

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Aug. 22: Police are being accused of refusing complaints of girl trafficking, particularly if the victim is poor.

 Two months ago, the police of Burwan in Murshidabad refused to register a complaint of 15-year-old Laila Khatun against a youth who tried to sell her off to pimps in Mumbai. 

 The police finally accepted her complaint after she sought the district superintendent of polices intervention.

 Parents of 17-year-old Pinjura Khatun have not been so lucky. They have been repeatedly visiting the Murshidabad police station for over two months to lodge a complaint against one Chhabi Bibi, who took Pinjura to Mumbai. 

 The girls father, Abdur Rob Khan, today submitted a memorandum to the subdivisional police officer (SDPO) of Lalbag, J. Dorji.

 Murshidabad superintendent of police Niraj Singh said he had asked the SDPO to immediately ensure that the complaint is accepted and an investigation started. We will immediately initiate action to trace the missing girl.

 Abdur, an agricultural labourer from Gakunda village in Behrampore, said Pinjura had gone to visit Sarifa Bibi, a relative, at Baradkhana village in the Murshidabad police station area on June 14. 

 Later, Chhabi, a neighbour of Sarifa, assured her that she would escort Pinjura to her home and left with the teenager on June 16.

 Abdur, in dark about the developments, went to Sarifas house on June 17 and learnt that her daughter had left with Chhabi the previous day. But Pinjura never returned home. 

 A search for Chhabi revealed that she, along with her husbands elder brother, Aminul Sheikh, had left for Mumbai, where Chhabis husband Sajan works as a mason.

 For a week from June 17, Abdur and his wife Mansura Bibi went to Murshidabad police station every day and urged the officers on duty to register a complaint against Chhabi but they refused. 

 On June 24, Pinjuras mother moved the court of the chief judicial magistrate, which asked the police to immediately register a complaint and start investigation. But nothing has been done yet.

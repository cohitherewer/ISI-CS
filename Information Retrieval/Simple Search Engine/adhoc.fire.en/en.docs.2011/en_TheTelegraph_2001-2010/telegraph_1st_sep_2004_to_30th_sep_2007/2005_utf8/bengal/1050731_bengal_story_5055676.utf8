 Calcutta, July 30: After years of uncertainty and several false starts, the Calcutta Leather Complex (CLC) finally opened its gates today at Bantala on the eastern fringes of the city.

 The largest integrated leather complex in the continent was inaugurated by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in the presence of Union finance minister P. Chidambaram and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee this morning. Several top ministers and bureaucrats of the state attended the programme.

 The Rs 600-crore project, spread over 1,100 acres, will be home to over 500 tanneries relocating from the heart of the city. Around 100 new leather goods units will also come up there and a special economic zone will be created for the leather industry. 

 M.L. Dalmiya and Company is the promoting firm of the complex.

 Bhattacharjee said Bengal would now throw a strong challenge to Chennai, the largest centre for leather. The complex will boost the traditional leather sector in the state. Currently, the state enjoys a 19.44 per cent share in the domestic market and 25.79 per cent share in the export of leather products. We feel the sector will advance rapidly after the CLC commences full-fledged production, he said.

 Speaking before him, Chidambaram described the complex as a a shining example of public-private partnership. 

 The project gives West Bengal an opportunity to regain its prime position in the leather industry, the finance minister said.

 So far, 30 tanneries have relocated their units to the CLC while others will shortly follow suit, said Bhattacharjee.

 Noting that the state governments investment in the project has crossed Rs 70 crore and another Rs 30 crore would be spent on public infrastructure, the chief minister requested Chidambaram to consider converting the Rs 32- crore central loan for the project into grant.

 He added that the CLC was expected to receive substantial foreign investment.

 Mukherjee said it is a welcome initiative for the state. We hope it will also become the best leather complex in Asia.

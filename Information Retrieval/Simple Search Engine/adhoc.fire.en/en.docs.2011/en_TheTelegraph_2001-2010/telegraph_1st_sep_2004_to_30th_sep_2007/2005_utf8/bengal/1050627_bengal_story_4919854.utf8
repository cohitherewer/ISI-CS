 Rambi (Kalimpong), June 26: It is still not clear how many people have died or are missing since the bailey bridge erected by the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC) collapsed more than 24 hours ago.

 According to police, at least four contract labourers working on the Teesta Low Dam Project (Stage-3) near here were killed and three others washed away as the bridge fell into the rain-fed Teesta when a concrete-mixture laden truck was trying to cross it. 

 The NHPC claimed that only the driver of the truck was missing. Senior officials of the organisation neither denied nor confirmed the casualty till late this evening. The hydel power major is yet to offer an official explanation for the mishap. 

 Witnesses told The Telegraph that two of those killed were hired labourers from Kandi subdivision in Murshidabad. They were identified as Kinta Mondal, 35, and Nagar Pal, 18.

 We are shocked that the NHPC allowed a lorry to ply on a bridge where dismantling work was on, said Gopal Viswakarma, the chief of the Teesta village panchayat. 

 Rescue work yielded little till late this evening because of the turbulence of the river. 

 It is learnt that family members of the NHPC chief-engineer-in-charge, R.K. Verma, had a providential escape. They crossed the bridge minutes before the accident. 

 Darjeeling superintendent of police Rajeev Mishra said: According to information available with us the toll is seven. This includes those trapped in the lorry that was crossing the bridge at the time of the accident. 

 Those inside the vehicle have been identified as driver Bijoy Paswan, 25, and helper Rupam Pandit, 18. 

 Viswakarma said: It was all too sudden.... The temporary bridge just gave way. 

 Somnath Pal, a worker who was at the site at the time of the accident, said: It split into two halves before we could even realise what was happening. The lorry disappeared from the middle as did the three labourers working on the bridge.

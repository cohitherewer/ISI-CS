 Minister calls for hospital shelters

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 1: Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra has asked non-government organisations to construct temporary accommodation at various hospitals in Calcutta for relatives of patients coming from outside.

 The missive follows health department findings that overcrowded state-run hospitals in Calcutta often witness violence involving cheating of patients? families coming from the city?s fringes or the outlying districts. These, at times, get blown into full-fledged crises. A patient?s family, under stress in Calcutta, often also end up in the hands of touts, the department has found.

 ?Patients? parities, particularly women, either harassed or stressed, will at least heave a sigh of relief if they are provided a night shelter in the hospital premises,? said a senior health department official.

 Mishra said the government will provide accommodation and supply electricity and drinking water to the NGOs and voluntary organisations interested in opening night shelters.

 ?We have agreed on principle to help NGOs and voluntary organisations intending to build night shelters following reports of harassment of women who have to spend nights in hospitals while visiting their relatives.?

 The idea was given by environment minister Manab Mukherjee, the prime mover behind the opening of a shelter at Dr B.C. Roy Children?s Hospital in Narkeldanga two months ago.

 ?Relatives of patients who have to stay there for treatment of their wards too often complain to me. I found the problem very serious as most of the relatives of patients are women. As it is a children?s hospital, mothers have to stay along with their wards. I requested the health department to allow me to open a night shelter at the hospital and it has been granted,? Mukherjee said.

 The shelter, which can accommodate about 30 persons and is being run by the Kankurgachi Lions Club, provides accommodation for relatives of a patient undergoing treatment at the hospital. They can spend a night there on paying a fee of Rs 2.

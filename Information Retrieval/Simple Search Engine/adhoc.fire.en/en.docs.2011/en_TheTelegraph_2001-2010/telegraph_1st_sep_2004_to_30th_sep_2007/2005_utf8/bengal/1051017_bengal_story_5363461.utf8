 Mamata still in Salim way

 BARUN GHOSH 

 Calcutta, Oct. 16: Mamata is sticking to her guns and hoping that she would be able to cobble together an alliance of parties opposed to the CPMs drive to set up industries in rural Bengal. 

 The Trinamul Congress chief, who has threatened to block entry points to the city when the Salim Group boss arrives here on Thursday, has also lined up a rally that day to plan a joint movement against conversion of farmland. 

 The convention will be held at Nizam Palace. It assumes significance as it coincides with Benny Santosos arrival. Our supporters will block all major entry points to the city to protest against the governments move to bring in the Indonesia-based industrialist, a party functionary said.

 Mamata made it clear that police have to allow her supporters to demonstrate peacefully. The administration will be held responsible if any untoward incident takes place, she told party leaders reacting to CPM leader Anil Biswass statement that the administration will take care of the Trinamul protesters.

 Trinamul spokesman and MLA Saugata Roy said Thursdays meeting will discuss a string of movements against the government on the Salim projects. We shall carry on a sustained movement to mobilise public support against the projects in the run-up to the Assembly elections, he added.

 Several Congress leaders keen to join Mamata today said state party president Pranab Mukherjee should not bar them from rallying behind Mamata on the Salim issue. We may not have a poll pact with her as she has not snapped ties with the BJP, but we can join her to corner the CPM, said Abdul Mannan, the MLA from Champdani in Hooghly.

 Another state Congress functionary, Kumud Bhatta-charya, said he would be at Nizam Palace on October 20.

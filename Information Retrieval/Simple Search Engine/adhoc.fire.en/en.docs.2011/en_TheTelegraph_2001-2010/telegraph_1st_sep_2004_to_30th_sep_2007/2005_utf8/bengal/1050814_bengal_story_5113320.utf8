 Bar ballot woe

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 13: The Congress-controlled West Bengal Lawyers Association is banking on the fallout of the hike in court fees and the Salishi Bill to retain majority in the bar council.

 Over 25,000 voters will ? through secret ballot, on September 2 and 3 ? elect a 25-member executive committee of the West Bengal Bar Council from the 79 candidates in the fray.

 The Congress-backed body is unperturbed by claims of the CPM-controlled Democratic Lawyers Association that it would increase its presence on the panel, the only statutory forum of lawyers across the state.

 Wherever DLA candidates are going to seek votes, general members are asking them about the reasons behind the court-fee hike. They are also inquiring about the fate of the Block Level Pre Litigation Conciliation Board Bill (commonly known as Salishi Bill), said Uttam Majumdar, the chairman of the outgoing council and the general secretary of the Congress-backed association. Majumdar is among the 79 in the fray.

 A former chairman of the council, Saradindu Biswas, echoed Majumdar. Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government decided not to bring the Salishi Bill in this session of the Assembly only after apprehending a disaster in the poll, asserted Biswas.

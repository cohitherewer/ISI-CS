 Race to Rajya Sabha begins

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, June 27: After the civic polls, the parties are gearing up for another battle: this time for the Rajya Sabha. 

 Four CPM Rajya Sabha members from Bengal ? Chandrakala Pandey, Sarala Maheswari, Jiban Roy and Chittabrata Majumder ? will complete their tenures on August 18. 

 Pandey and Maheswari might be dropped as they have completed two consecutive terms. Majumder is likely to be renominated. Sources said Roy, a trade unionist, is likely to face the axe as Majumder also represents the same front. 

 The CPM is considering fielding Shyamoli Gupta, a central committee member, for the elections slated for July 14.

 Abani Roy of the RSP and former army chief Shankar Roy Chowdhury, a consensus candidate, might be renominated, the sources said.

 The CPM state secretariat will meet at Alimuddin Street tomorrow to finalise the list. 

 Mamata Banerjee is likely to put up quiz-master Derek Brien as a candidate, though Trinamul Congress general secretary Mukul Roy is said to be eyeing a berth in the Upper House. Derek appears to have an edge by virtue of his proximity to Mamata, who tried to cash in on his popularity in the civic polls. The Trinamul chief is also keen to consolidate her minority vote bank before the Assembly elections. 

 We shall decide on it soon, Mamata told some key functionaries who called on her.

 The state Congress, too, has decided to put up a candidate. Our candidate might sail through if there is a split among Trinamul legislators, said a senior Congress leader. 

 If there are differences among the parties regarding Roy Chowdhurys nomination, the CPM will put up its own candidate for the seat. It is learnt that the party has economist Amiya Bagchi in mind.

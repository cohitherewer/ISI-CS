 Tea amp; trip to bazaar after twin murders

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 17: Minutes after killing his wife and eight-year-old son, Subhasish sipped morning tea with his father Dipak Dutta. 

 He then picked up a bag and hurried off to the bazaar around 6.45. Neither Dutta nor his wife Pranati suspected anything amiss. 

 Only after he failed to return in about two hours, his parents started worrying. 

 His mother found the door to her sons bedroom locked. She took a bunch of duplicate keys and opened it. Subhasishs wife Indrani, 32, was lying on a blood-splattered bed. On her body lay Anirban. Dead.

 Late in the night, police said his body had been found on the railway tracks at Nabagram, Burdwan, about 85 km from his house at Tantipara in Dankuni, on the periphery of the city. 

 A railway engineer under suspension for the past year, Subhasish, 42, slashed Indranis right wrist and slit Anirbans throat. 

 Arijit Dasgupta, the officer-in-charge of the Dankuni police station, said: He killed himself under the Down Jammu Tawi Express. Government Railway Police personnel found the body.

 Before leaving home, Subhasish called a friend to say: Ive wiped out my family, please look after my parents. 

 Hours after the gruesome killings, the police failed to ascertain the motive. It appears that Subhasish was suffering from depression because of his suspension. We will have to talk to the officers of his department, said Bharat Lal Meena, the Serampore subdivisional police officer.

 Sreya Ghosh, Subhasishs only sister, an income-tax officer, said: We do not have any idea about why he was suspended. He used to tell us that he was being transferred frequently.

 Dasgupta said: I went to the railway offices at Sealdah and Chitpur. But the officers there had left because it was Saturday. Why he was sus- pended can only be known on Monday.

 During dinner last night, Subhasish asked his father to accompany him to the divisional railway managers office in Sealdah this morning. He wanted to withdraw his past three months salary, Dutta said. 

 We were a family of four. I stayed on the ground floor while the rest lived on the first. Around 6.45, I prepared the morning tea. Like other days, I called Subhasish. He came down and we had tea together. When he was about to leave, I told him there was no need to go because we had enough vegetables in the refrigerator. We dont eat non-veg items on Saturdays.

 After two-and-a-half hours, Dutta came out from the house and saw a gathering of Subhasishs friends. I went to the nearby hardware shop owned by his friend Swapan. He had received his call. Swapan asked me to go home. The moment I reached my house, I heard my wife scream.

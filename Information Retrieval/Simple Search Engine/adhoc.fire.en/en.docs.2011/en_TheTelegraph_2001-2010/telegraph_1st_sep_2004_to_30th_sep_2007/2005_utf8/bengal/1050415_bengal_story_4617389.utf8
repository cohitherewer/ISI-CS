 Suicide over exam

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, April 14: Pinky Mondal, a Class III student, committed suicide last evening after being beaten up by her mother for not performing well in her annual examination. 

 Every exam day, Pinky would have to sit with the question paper and be grilled by her mother, armed with the textbook, on how she fared. 

 The nine-year-old student of Bahirampur Primary School at Nakashipara in Nadia, about 130 km from Calcutta, wrote her Bengali paper yesterday. Like most other days, her mother was not happy ? the beating followed a round of reprimands.

 ?Pinky faced the music every time her mother detected a mistake. Probably a fear psychosis started working in her mind and her mistakes increased. Yesterday, her mother found numerous mistakes in translation and spellings,? said a police officer. Her cries had attracted the attention of neighbours. 

 Nakashipara circle inspector A. Rashidujjaman said Pinky?s father Ashish, a trader in agricultural items, had pesticides stored at home. 

 ?Around 7 pm, when her mother was busy cooking, Pinky poured an entire bottle down her throat.? 

 Half-an-hour later, her mother found Pinky on the floor, gasping for breath. She died at the block hospital an hour later.

 30 houses looted in 60 minutes

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Dhantola, Dec. 9: Fifteen masked men armed with pipe-guns and daggers raided 30 houses one after the other at a village here in Nadia early this morning and fled with cash and jewellery worth lakhs.

 They allegedly assaulted at least half-a-dozen women of Purbasimurali village who tried to prevent them from taking away their ornaments. 

 Dhantola, about 80 km from Calcutta, made news in February 2003 when dacoits robbed passengers of two buses returning from wedding receptions and raped over a dozen women. 

 Around 1 am today, the dacoits arrived at the village ? comprising mostly farmers ? and called for Bham, a notorious and wanted criminal of Bongaon in North 24-Parganas. Open the door, we have come to search for Bham. We want to find out whether he is hiding inside, the dacoits shouted and threatened them with dire consequences if the doors were not opened.

 Nadia police chief R. Rajsekharan said it appears the dacoits were Bhams rivals. The village is close to the Nadia-North 24-Parganas border and an easy strike zone. The entire operation lasted an hour.

 Sujan Biswas, a nayek in the army whose house was the first to be raided, said: We were confused as they said they were looking for Bham. We realised they were dacoits only when they ordered us to hand over our cash and other belongings. They threatened to take away the women if we did not obey their orders. 

 After looting Sujans house, the dacoits bolted the door from outside and struck the next house in the same way.

 They bolted every house from outside, said another villager, Shankar Biswas. 

 His 19-year-old daughter Kabita tried to prevent the rampage but one of the dacoits gagged her and threatened to hack her with a chopper.

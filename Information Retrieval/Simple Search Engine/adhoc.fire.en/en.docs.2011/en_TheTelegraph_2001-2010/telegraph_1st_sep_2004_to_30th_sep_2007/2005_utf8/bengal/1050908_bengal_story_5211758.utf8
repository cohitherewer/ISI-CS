 Rule-flouting clinics face police action

 - Govt mulls law to fix nursing home rates

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 7: Unlawful activities of some city nursing homes and clinics would now have to bear the health departments brunt.

 In response to an earlier high court order, the government today filed an affidavit saying that the department has already lodged FIRs against 18 errant nursing homes, pathological laboratories and diagnostic centres.

 A committee comprising 10 eminent physicians and professors has also been constituted to prepare a set of rates for various treatments, clinical investigations and other procedures. The rate card would have to be followed by all clinical establishments in the state.

 In the affidavit, filed by the deputy assistant director of West Bengal Heath Service, Tanmoy Mukherjee, the health department hinted that the government was mulling an amendment to the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Act to establish some control over the private clinics and nursing homes. The change, it added, was necessary to curb their illegal acts and ensure a uniform rate. 

 FIRs have been lodged against 18 clinical establishments with the deputy commissioner of police (detective department), Lal Bazar, and superintendent of police, South 24-Parganas, for their failure in following rules under the clinical establishment act, Mukherjee told the court.

 The establishments named in the FIR were:

 MGM Clinic, Rash Behari 

 Avenue

 Scanlab, Bijoygarh

 Hazra View Nursing Home, 

 SP Mukherjee Road

 Sebayan Physiotherapy centre, 

 Raja S C Mallik Road

 Ananda Clinic, Diamond 

 Harbour Road

 Standard Clinic Laboratory, 

 DH Road

 Sayan X-Ray and PB Surgical,

 South Clinic, DH Road

 Life X-Ray and ECG Clinic,

 OM Clinic, Sambhunath Pandit

 Bhawanipore X-Ray Centre, 

 SN Pandit Street

 Overseas Diagnostic, SN

 Gajanand Clinic, Harish 

 Mukherjee Road

 Kustia Road

 Puvlov Clinic Laboratory, 

 Rani Devendra Bala Road

 BN Health Care, Golf Green

 Amoy Polyclinic and Diagnostic 

 Centre, Garfa Main Road

 Amoy Polyclinic and Diagnostic 

 Centre, Gariahat Road 

 An inquiry is being conducted by an officer entrusted by the licensing authority and action is being taken against the clinical establishments for their failure in maintaining records and documents, the affidavit says. 

 The division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly had asked the authorities to file the affidavit after advocate Subroto Mookherjee moved a public interest litigation demanding court intervention to put an end to the the illegal acts of some nursing homes and clinical laboratories in and around the city.

 The advocate had alleged that hundreds of such establishments were being run without proper licenses and other papers. Thousands of common people are being cheated by the authorities of such establishments everyday, he said.

 The chief minister had earlier expressed concern about healthcare institutions that have mushroomed across the state but fail to deliver quality services despite charging patients more than they should.

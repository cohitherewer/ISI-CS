 Lufthansa return buzz in the air

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Calcutta, July 23: Lufthansa is set to touch down in Calcutta after over three decades. 

 Senior officials of the German airline held a special interactive session with travel agents last night to discuss their plans for the city and the eastern region. 

 If things fall into place, the airline, which had wound up operations in the city way back in the seventies, will connect Calcutta to Frankfurt and Munich in October next year. 

 Leading the Lufthansa team was Werner Heesen, general manager (passenger sales-India) and director (South Asia). He was accompanied by accounts manager James Paul and the airlines marketing consultant Rajesh Das. 

 The session went off very well and Heesen felt that the city has undergone a lot of positive changes. They told us that they are looking at October 2006 as the tentative dates for resuming operations, said Anil Punjabi, the chairman (east) of the Travel Agents Federation of India. 

 The airline at present connects all the metros with Frankfurt and other German and European destinations. There are also three flights a week from Hyderabad. The airline currently operates only cargo flights to Calcutta.

 While some Lufthansa officials, including Heesen, left the city soon after the meeting, Das stayed back to check out some marketing aspects.

 We are looking at Calcutta strongly as a market. The city has undoubtedly huge potential, especially with its proximity to the northeastern states and neighbouring countries, he said. By end-December, the picture will be clearer. 

 The Lufthansa teams touchdown has got the citys travel industry abuzz. 

 The Lufthansa officials seemed very pleased with the IT boom in the city as well. The talks went off very well and we would all be extremely happy to extend our hand to the airline which has an excellent track record all over the world, Punjabi said. 

 Another reason why the travel industry is so excited is that Lufthansa will be the citys link to all major destinations around Europe and the US. There are some destinations in the US where only Lufthansa connects. Their hospitality and connectivity is excellent, said a travel agent. 

 The airline has 747 jumbo Boeings (398-seaters) and Airbus 340 (250-seaters) in its fleet.

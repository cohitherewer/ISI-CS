 6 classes in 6 months, salary full

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, May 27: Over a hundred students of a West Midnapore primary school are at the mercy of their lone teacher, who took classes on six days since November but managed to conduct the annual examinations this March.

 Dinesh Mahato has not visited Bangbuta Primary School in Belpahari, about 180 km from Calcutta, since the exam, villagers alleged.

 About 8 km from Belpahari town, the school is the only one in the area and caters to children belonging to the poor and backward Santhal, Mahato and Shabar communities. 

 But Dinesh Mahato, who stays in a village about 60 km from the school, finds the journey by bus and cycle tiring. 

 There is no place near the school where I can stay. So I am forced to make the tedious tour. There are only a few buses. Naturally, their timings do not always tally with the schools, he said. In the six months, though, he had been punctual in drawing his salary from a bank in Belpahari.

 District inspector of schools (primary) Paresh Chandra Mahapatra said an order has been issued to freeze the salary. We have also served him a showcause notice.

 Teacher posts precede poll

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 22: The government today announced the creation of 24,000 schoolteacher posts across the state.

 The recruitment is expected to begin in 2006 ? election year for Bengal. 

 School education minister Kanti Biswas said the decision to create so many new posts at one shot was aimed at carrying forward the spread of elementary education beyond 2007, by when the ongoing Sarba Siksha Abhijan will be over. 

 ?The scheme aims at providing elementary education to all children below 15 by 2007. Across Bengal, the project is progressing well and we are sure that we will be able to reach our target within the deadline set by the Centre,? Biswas said.

 ?We need proper infrastructure, particularly adequate staff, to maintain this progress. The new teachers will enable us to ensure that no child below 15 remains out of school even after the Sarba Siksha Abhijan is over.?

 However, political observers said the move was made with an eye on the polls. Recently, the government announced 800 new teacher posts in undergraduate colleges.

 Of the 24,000 new schoolteacher posts, 8,000 will be in the upper primary level ? between classes V and VIII. The remaining teachers will be for classes I-IV.

 The government will have to bear an additional expenditure of Rs 1,000 crore a year for paying salary to the new teachers. In 2004-2005, the state?s annual expenditure on school education was about Rs 1,700 crore, 96 per cent of which was spent on teachers? salaries. 

 The district primary education councils will recruit the teachers for primary schools and the school service commission will appoint the secondary school teachers. 

 Bengal lags behind several other states in teacher-student ratio. In primary schools, it is 1:52. Ideally, there should be at least one teacher for every 40 students. In the secondary level, the ratio in Bengal is 1:40, but it should ideally be one teacher for 33 students.

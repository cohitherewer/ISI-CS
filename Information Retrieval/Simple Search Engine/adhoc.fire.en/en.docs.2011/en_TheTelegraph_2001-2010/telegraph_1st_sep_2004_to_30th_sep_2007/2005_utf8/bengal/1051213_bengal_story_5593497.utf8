 Eighteen years on, landless again

 ALAMGIR HOSSAIN

 Farakka, Dec. 12: Despite the chief ministers assurance to farmers that their interests would be protected while creating plots for industry, the Murshidabad administration has cancelled the land-holding of 35 farmers on whose fields a cement factory will be set up.

 Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is scheduled to lay the foundation stone of the Rs 125-crore cement factory of the Ambuja group at Kendoa village in Farakka, 290 km from Calcutta, on December 17. Local MP and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee will also be present on the occasion.

 The group of 35, which cultivated paddy on 10 acres once a year in winter, is now landless. We were provided the patta (land-holding) by the government. We will seek the chief ministers intervention when he comes here, said a farmer, Ataruddin Sheikh. 

 The government gave them the holding about 18 years ago, as part of its policy to provide land to the landless. Now we are landless again, said Hakimul Momin.

 District magistrate N. Manjunatha Prasad said the government had the right to cancel a patta if it was not being utilised properly. These low-lying plots were given out for farming, but we had received a report from the land department saying that the holders were not cultivating their land. On the basis of that report, it was taken away and given to the Ambuja group, he said.

 The group had sought 65 acres from the government. It purchased 55 acres of private land through us. We arranged another 10 by cancelling the pattas. Everything was done according to the law. We have requested the group to arrange some compensation for the farmers, Prasad said.

 A field officer of the proposed factory, Rajiv Sinha, said: We have purchased the land through the government. We cant say anything more.

 With his land gone, Hakimul Momin has started selling oil cakes (telebhaja). We were initially told that we will be compensated. CPM leaders had assured us that we would be given land elsewhere. But land department officials said we will get nothing, he said.

 With a wife and four children, Ataruddin Sheikh is on the verge of starvation. I used to raise six months resources to feed my family from the paddy. I was landless 18 years ago... the Left Front government gave me the rights to a small plot... Now it has taken it away.

 The district CPM unit has no plans to launch an agitation. Former MP and district secretariat member Abul Hasnat Khan said: We are aware of the Kendoa farmers difficulties. We are trying to get them holdings of agricultural land in some other place through the panchayat samiti.

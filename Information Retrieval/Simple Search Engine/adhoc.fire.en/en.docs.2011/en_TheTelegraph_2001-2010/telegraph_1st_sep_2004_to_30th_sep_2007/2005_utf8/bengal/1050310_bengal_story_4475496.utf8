 Wage hike for teachers

 SHANKAR MUKHERJEE

 Calcutta, March 9: The 

 state government has raised the salary of college teachers 

 on contract by a whopping Rs 12,000 a month.

 The government hopes the hike will help fill up the over 200 posts of college teachers that are lying vacant across the state.

 ?We realised that the good and deserving candidates are refusing to take up the job of teachers because of the poor pay packet. This is why we decided to offer Rs 14,000 per month to the teachers on contract,? higher education secretary Jawhar Sircar said.

 ?Nowadays, a person who has completed his postgraduation can easily earn at least Rs 10,000 per month through private tuition. So, why should he chase the job of a contractual college teacher for Rs 2,000? We discussed the matter with senior officials and academics and decided to hike the pay to Rs 14,000.? 

 The amount is the minimum a permanent college teacher gets. 

 The Public Service Commission (PSC) appoints government college teachers. Officials said 242 posts are lying vacant across the state. 

 The government?s action has come in the wake of increasing student resentment over absence of teachers. ?It is a fact that students are suffering. We have asked the PSC to prepare a panel of candidates to fill up the vacant posts but it will take time to complete formalities. We have decided to appoint teachers on contract basis immediately so that classes are not hampered,? Sircar said.

 ?In the first phase, we will appoint 71 teachers and we have already initiated the process,?? he added. 

 Candidates will be selected after an interview for a six-month contract. ?If the government fails to fill up the vacant posts with permanent teachers, the contracts may be renewed. Those joining as contract teachers will get preference when the PSC prepares the panel of permanent teachers,? an official said.

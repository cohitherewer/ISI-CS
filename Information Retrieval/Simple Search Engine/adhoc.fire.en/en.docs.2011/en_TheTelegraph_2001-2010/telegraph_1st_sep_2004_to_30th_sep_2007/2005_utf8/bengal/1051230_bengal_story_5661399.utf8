 Affair whiff in student murder

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Dec. 29: A 20-year-old youth was hacked to death in Murshidabad last night.

 Police said preliminary investigation has revealed that Surjya Shekhar Hajra, a first-year BA student at Krishnanath College in Behrampore, was murdered over a love affair. The police have arrested 21-year-old Alim Mollah in this connection.

 We believe Surjya was murdered as a fallout of a love triangle. We are investigating the matter and have arrested one person in this regard, said district superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh.

 Around 9 pm yesterday, some youths came to Hajras house in Simulia village near Behrampore town, around 200 km from Calcutta, and called him out. 

 Surjya went out with them but when he did not return till 11 pm, his parents started looking for him. He was not found at the local club. As word spread, villagers also joined the search. This morning, his body, with deep injuries and strangulation marks, was found in a mustard field, a police officer said. Surjya was strangled with the muffler he had round his neck, he added.

 Along with his studies, Surjya, the son of a small farmer, also served in the village as a quack. He took regular lessons from a quack with a successful practice in the nearby village of Rampara.

 We searched Surjyas room and found two love letters written by Shampa Biswas, a 19-year-old girl of neighbouring Srirampur village and daughter of a farmer. From the letters, we came to know of Alim Mollah, an unemployed youth of Srirampur, who had proposed to the girl, the officer said.

 Surjyas father Kesto Hajra is in a state of shock. We are illiterate people. We have always seen Surjya working hard to become self-reliant. Of my four sons and three daughters, Surjya is the youngest and the only one who has been able to pass higher secondary and enter college. 

 He was studious and was also serious about his practice as a quack. We never knew he was having an affair with any girl, Kesto said.

 Villagers said from the love letters it was found that Shampa was in love with Surjya and had recently refused Alim, also a farmers son.

 Humayun Kabir, a trader, who was with the police when the letters were found, said they indicated Shampa was being pestered by Alim and was trying to ward him off.

 One of Surjyas friends, Ramen Biswas, said he knew about the affair. Surjya and Shampa had been in love since their schooldays. Surjya was madly in love with her. We are shocked at the brutal way he was murdered.

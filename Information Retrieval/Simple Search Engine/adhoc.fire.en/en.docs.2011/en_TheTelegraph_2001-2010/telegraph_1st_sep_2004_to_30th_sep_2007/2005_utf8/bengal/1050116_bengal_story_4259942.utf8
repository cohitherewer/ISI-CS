 Green light to bus-fare hike

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 15: The Left Front today green-signalled an increase in bus and mini-bus fares to offset the recent hike in diesel prices.

 Transporters have demanded a hike in fares on the ground that they are incurring additional expenses because of the rise in diesel prices, said Left Front chairman Biman Bose at a Front meeting at the CPM headquarters on Alimuddin Street.

 ?We have asked the transport department to fix the bus and mini-bus fares after taking into account the economic condition of the common people,? said Bose. ?There is no way we can turn down the demand for a fare hike because the price of diesel is Rs 28.72 per litre now, up from Rs 21.48 per litre in October 2003.?

 Transport department officials tonight said the minimum fare would be Rs 3.50 and 50 paise for the subsequent stages.

 Front partners said bus fares should be structured in such way that the passengers do not suffer. Bose assured the allies that the government would keep the interest of passengers in mind.

 Bus fares were last hiked on July 5, 2004. The minimum fare for buses and mini-buses was fixed at Rs 3 and Rs 3.5, respectively. Bus operators demanded another hike after the price of diesel was increased by Rs 3.69 per litre.

 Organisations of bus operators, including the Bengal Bus Syndicate and the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates, had earlier demanded that Rs 4.50 be fixed as the minimum fare and Re 1 as the fare for the subsequent stages.

 The operators had threatened to go on an indefinite strike, but had retracted following an assurance from transport minister Subhas Chakraborty.

 The minister said today that the demand for a fare hike is justified. ?I admit that the operators are incurring additional expenses due to hike in diesel price,? he said.

 The new fares would be announced soon, the minister said.

 Bus operators have threatened to withdraw all buses and mini-buses if the government does not announce the new fares within two days.

 ?The transport minister assured us that he would announce the revised fare structure by January 15 but he missed the deadline. We will wait for a couple of days and if the government does not announce the fare hike by then we will have no option but to withdraw buses from the routes,? said Bengal Bus Syndicate president Swarnakamal Saha.

 CBI fishes out lakhs, quartet in the dock

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 30: The CBI today raided over a dozen places in and around the city as part of its swoop on corrupt officials and found three central employees in possession of assets disproportionate to income and evidence against a bank manager who allegedly misused his powers.

 Samir Kumar Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institute of Homeopathy in Salt Lake, S.K. Mondal, an engineer posted in the Uttarpara telephone exchange in Hooghly, Narcotics Control Bureau superintendent Gora Chand Chatterjee and S.K. Mishra, a manager of the SBIs Kabardanga branch ? off Prince Anwar Shah Road ? were found to have amassed a fortune.

 Mishra was accused of misusing his position to sanction loans in lieu of money.

 Personnel of the bureaus anti-corruption branch collected papers, which apparently revealed their misdeeds.

 The CBIs special crime branch raided Chatterjees house in Lake Town and seized papers, bank documents, cash and jewellery worth around Rs 30 lakh. 

 The investigators later said his total assets could be Rs 75-80 lakh.

 The raids started around 8 am and continued late into the afternoon with 18 teams of officers moving in a battery of cars, scouring houses, offices, and industrial units across the city, Howrah and Hooghly.

 None of the officials has been arrested. We are assimilating the documents that were collected. We will have to finish some work before we file the chargesheet, a senior CBI officer said. 

 Bhattacharya owns a flat worth Rs 17.5 lakh, besides a plot on which he is construct- ing a house. He also owns a car worth Rs 4.5 lakh, has Rs 8.16 lakh in the bank and National Savings Certificates worth Rs 2.33 lakh. His locker will be opened tomorrow. 

 A raid on Mondals Howrah house led to the recovery of Rs 1.9 lakh, around 10,000 share certificates, whose value is yet to be ascertained, a car worth Rs 5.6 lakh, a motorcycle and LIC certificates worth Rs 6.5 lakh. His three-storey house is valued at Rs 20 lakh, CBI sources said. 

 Mondal had also set up a factory on a 16-cottah plot in Howrahs Kadamtala, where nine lifting machines and a heavy crane work. 

 In a year, Mishra, the CBI sources said, had disbursed around Rs 98 lakh as loan to 21 people, some of whom existed only on paper. 

 Although the money was given away as housing loans, no houses were built or flats constructed.

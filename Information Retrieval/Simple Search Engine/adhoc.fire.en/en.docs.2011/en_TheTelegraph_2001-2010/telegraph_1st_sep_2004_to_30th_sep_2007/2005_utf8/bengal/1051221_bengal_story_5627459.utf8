 In-laws and husband held for rape 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, Dec. 20: A 52-year-old man was arrested today for allegedly forcing his daughter-in-law to have sex with him to ensure that the family had a successor.

 Sujata Biswas, 25, already the mother of a four-year-old son by her father-in-law, went to police at Deganga near Barasat after he began pressuring her for a second child.

 Krishnadhan Biswas, an affluent trader and farmer, was arrested today along with his wife Putul and son Kamal. All three have confessed to their crime, North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said. 

 Sujata married Kamal, a labour contractor, about six years ago. S.M.H. Meerza, the Barasat sub-divisional police officer, said: He is impotent. The couple had undergone medical treatment but it didnt yield any result. When Krishnadhan came to know about it, he asked Sujata to help him have a descendant.

 According to the police, when Sujata complained to her mother-in-law, she advised her to agree to the proposal. Sujata was raped repeatedly, an officer said.

 Krishnadhan, who had recently told her about his desire for a second child, tried to have sex with her yesterday. 

 Sujata went to the police with her son this morning.

 The nation was shamed when Ali Mohammad, 59, was held for raping daughter-in-law Imrana in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh, earlier this year. A qazi had ordered her out of the village because the assault altered her relationship with her husband.

 The Barasat chief judicial magistrates court has remanded the trio in a weeks jail custody. All three have signed confessional statements. None of them appeared repentant, Praveen Kumar said.

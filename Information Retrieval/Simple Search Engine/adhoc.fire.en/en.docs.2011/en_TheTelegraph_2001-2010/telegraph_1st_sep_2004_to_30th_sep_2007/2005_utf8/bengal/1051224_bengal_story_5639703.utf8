 Bail amp; bar for Adhir

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 23: Murder accused MP Adhir Chowdhury, now lodged in Behrampore Central Jail, obtained bail from the high court today. 

 A division bench of Justices A.K. Talukdar and S.P. Mitra granted his prayer on the condition that the Behrampore MP would not enter his home district, Murshidabad, except to attend trials. He will have to surrender his passport and furnish a surety of Rs 50,000 to the Behrampore court to secure release. 

 In future, Chowdhury will have to keep police informed about his whereabouts. 

 The Congress leader was picked up from his official residence in Delhi on November 19 for his alleged involvement in a double murder in the town in July. A gang of five had raided Nilufa hotel and shot dead its owner Hanif Sheikh and his son Laltoo. 

 Days later, police arrested Moktar Sheikh, one of the alleged killers. He initially said in the Behrampore court that he had carried out Chowdhurys orders but told the same court later that the police had forced him to implicate him. 

 Warrants were issued against Chowdhury and his wife Arpita. After a subdivisional judicial magistrate and the district sessions judge refused bail to the MP, he moved the high court, which had granted anticipatory bail to Arpita.

 Balai Ray, the advocate-general, told the court that Hanif and his son were killed as they had left the Congress. 

 But Chowdhurys lawyers argued that according to the Supreme Court, a chargesheet could not be issued on the basis of a confessional statement that had been retracted later.

 Investor incentives to stay

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 20: Bengal would have to continue offering incentives to attract investors as long as other states continue to do so, state commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen told the Assembly today.

 Sen, however, added that the tax subidies offered to investors under the scheme have been scaled down since 1993. 

 Trinamul Congress leader Saugata Roy argued that it is also important to look at the industrial ambience, labour relations and logistics. 

 He suggested that the infrastructure be made more competitive rather than the incentive schemes. Can the incentive scheme be done away with? Sen asked.

 The minister replied: You have raised a very important point? and I disagree with you partly. We have to carry on with the offers as long as other states go on.

 However, Sen ? who trumpeted Bengals status as second only to Gujarat in terms of investments ? admitted, to build an investment climate, infrastructure like roads, parks, etc. need to be developed. 

 We are seriously looking at the area, he said.

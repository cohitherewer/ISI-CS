 Peasant pressure keeps allies busy

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 13: The CPI, RSP and the Forward Bloc are likely to fail the September 18 deadline for submitting their replies to the CPM on various issues related to the Salim Group projects and conversion of farmland for industry.

 On Sunday, Left Front chairman Biman Bose distributed among the partners a note prepared by the government on the Salim projects and asked them to submit their opinions on it by September 18.

 But all three today indicated that they might require more time. After receiving their response, Bose is supposed to call a front meeting. 

 It is learnt that the CPI, RSP and the Bloc leaderships have been asked to explain certain issues regarding the conversion of agricultural land for the Salim projects by their peasants wings. 

 Our peasants unit, the All India Krishak Sabha, wants to know how much farm- land will be converted for the Salim projects and how many farmers will be rendered landless, a senior CPI leader said.

 Informed sources also said that all three partners wanted to clear the issue with their farmers wings before submitting their replies to Bose.

 RSP state secretary Debabrata Bandopadhyay said the note he received from Bose did not contain details about the projects. We can hardly describe it as a statement. We require more information on the Salim projects. However, we will discuss the note during our next meeting on September 18 and we might take one or two days to give our replies to the front chairman, he said.

 Bloc state secretary Ashok Ghosh said his party has initiated talks with its farmer leaders. Bose had asked us to submit our opinion by September 18, but we might take a few more days.

 A CPI state secretariat member said the partys senior leaders would go to Delhi to attend a national secretariat meeting on September 17. Naturally, we will not be able to submit our views on the note by September 18. 

 Sources said the CPI and the RSP still have some reservations about the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee governments decision to convert farmland to set up industry. 

 Their leaders are under pressure from their peasants wings and are not in a position to say yes to the government.

 The Bloc leadership, on the other hand, is said to be soft towards Bhattacharjees approach and is likely to give its consent to the chief minister. The Agragami Kishan Sabha, its farmers unit, is hurt but ready to fall in line.

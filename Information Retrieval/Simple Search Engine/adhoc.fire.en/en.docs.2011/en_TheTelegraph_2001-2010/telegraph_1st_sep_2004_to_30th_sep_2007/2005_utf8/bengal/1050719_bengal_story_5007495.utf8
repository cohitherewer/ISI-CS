 Divorcee to widow in court 

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 18: From a divorcee, Anjali Ghosh became a widow in the high court today as it set aside a trial court decree of her marriage split.

 Anjali had challenged the divorce order and her husband, Subodh Kumar Ghosh, a railway employee, died when the case was pending in the high court. 

 After todays judgment, she would be considered a widow and not a divorcee and have the liberty to claim the property of her late husband.

 Subodh, a resident of Kalighat Road, married Anjali in 1989. However, the marriage was soon on the rocks. 

 In July 1991, Anjali lodged a diary with Bhowanipore police station bringing charges of cruelty and torture against her husband and in-laws.

 The same year, Ghosh moved a petition before the Alipore court seeking divorce. In 1998, the court awarded the divorce decree in favour of the petitioner. 

 Anjali then proceeded to the high court. On October 29, 2003, Ghosh died.

 Now, a question was raised ? whether the case could be continued in the absence of the respondent. 

 Anjalis lawyers, Biswajit Basu and Sushenjit Banik, argued that the case could be continued as other related matters, like widows pension and other benefits, resulting from her husbands death were also involved.

 On December 12, 2003, the division bench of Justice Samaresh Banerjee and Justice Indira Benerjee said: The case should continue as the father and sisters of the deceased were also claimants of his property. The judges made Ghoshs father, Jagannath, and his two widowed sisters ? Gita Dasgupta and Meena Das ? the opposite party to the case. 

 The original appeal (against the divorce decree of the Alipore court) then came up for hearing before the division bench of Justices Bhaskar Bhattacharjee and Rajendra Nath Sinha.

 Appearing for Anjali, Basu argued that the divorce decree granted by the trial court was not in accordance with the law. The judge only relied on allegations made by the husband. He did not hear her pleas. The lawyer said the in-laws subjected Anjali to regular torture. That was why she lodged the police complaint. The husband had moved the divorce case to avoid the police hazards. 

 Today, the division bench accepted the argument and held that the divorce decree awarded in favour of Ghosh was bad in law. It also said that Anjali would be considered Subodhs widow and not a divorcee.

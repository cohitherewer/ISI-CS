 Plastic slur on hill council

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, April 23: The minister for environment and information technology, Manab Mukherjee, today blamed the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council for not doing enough to implement the ban on the use of plastic and to check the indiscriminate piling of plastic waste in the hills.

 ?Despite our repeated appeals, the DGHC has not been cooperative in enforcing the ban on plastic,? said Mukherjee who was at Manebhanjan at a four-day nature study camp for schoolchildren organised by the pollution control board and the Paschim Banga Bigyan Mancha.

 Manebhanjan, about 80 km from Siliguri, is a major transit point on the way to the popular trekking destination of Sandakphu.

 Mukherjee admitted that the state government has failed to fully implement the plastic ban in the district, unlike in neighbouring Sikkim.

 ?It is not possible for the government to make a plastic ban effective through policing or time-to-time raids. What is needed is sensitising the masses and their greater participation in community activities, which can be done only by local bodies. The DGHC has not been able to do so,? he said.

 In September 2003, the state?s pollution control board had banned the manufacture and use of plastic carry-bags less than 20 microns thick in Darjeeling district. A few months later, the ban was widened to include all plastic bags irrespective of thickness.

 Mukherjee said the government was seeking stricter laws. ?Six months ago we wrote the President seeking a new rule that would clearly outline the duties and responsibilities of local bodies in effecting a plastic ban. We will pass the new rules in the Assembly,? he said.

 About 60 school-children from all over the state were at the nature-study camp.

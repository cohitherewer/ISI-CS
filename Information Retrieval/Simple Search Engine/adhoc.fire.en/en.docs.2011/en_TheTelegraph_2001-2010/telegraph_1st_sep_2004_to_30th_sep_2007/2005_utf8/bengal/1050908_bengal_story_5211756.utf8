 Dengue spares north

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Siliguri, Sept. 7: Dengue might have assumed epidemic proportions in Calcutta and its neighbourhood, but north Bengal is largely free from the disease, barring one reported case in Siliguri that needs to be investigated further.

 Health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra (picture above) today took stock of the situation in Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Cooch Behar at a meeting with senior civic and health officials of the three districts. Unlike last year, when Siliguri had reported some dengue cases, there has been no such case in north Bengal this year, barring one in Siliguri. But that patient may have been afflicted elsewhere, Mishra said.

 The minister, who was accompanied by principal secretary, health, Kalyan Bagchi, will review the situation in Malda, North Dinajpur and South Dinajpur tomorrow.

 To ensure early detection of the disease in the region, the government has provided an Elisa testing kit to the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital. We received the kit today, said principal Sangeeta Bhattacharya.

 She added that her hospital has been on alert for the past two weeks, but is yet to receive or diagnose any dengue cases.

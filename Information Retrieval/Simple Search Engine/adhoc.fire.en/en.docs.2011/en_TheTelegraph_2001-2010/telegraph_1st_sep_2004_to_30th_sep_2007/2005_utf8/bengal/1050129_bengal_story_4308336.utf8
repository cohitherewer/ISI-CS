 Congress duo misses date with Delhi brass

 Skipping

 Calcutta, Jan. 28: Two senior Congress leaders today gave the slip to a meeting called by the party brass in Delhi to select a consensus candidate as the Bengal chief.

 Somen Mitra, a former state party president, had a wedding to attend and legislature party leader Atish Sinha was caught up with things more important in Maharashtra.

 Their absence sent the rumour mill in the faction-ridden state unit spinning. 

 However, it did not stop the AICC from directing the state unit to elect a new president ?by consensus?. The task has to be completed by April 30, the last date for the party?s organisational elections. 

 Since being inducted into Manmohan Singh?s cabinet as defence minister, state party chief Pranab Mukherjee had been asking for relief from his additional responsibility. 

 Mukherjee and Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi attended the meeting with Ambika Soni, the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal affairs, and Oscar Fernandes, the AICC general secretary in charge of organisational affairs. 

 State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya, Murshidabad Congress chief and Behrampore MP Adhir Chowdhury and state party general secretary Manas Bhuniya were also present at the meeting along with several leaders from the party?s frontal organisations. 

 Mitra was in Nagpur for the wedding of Rajya Sabha member Jayanta Bhattacharya?s son. Sinha is in Maharashtra in connection with a tour of Bengal MLAs.

 Neither Soni nor Fernandes was available for comment after the meeting. A state leader said from the capital the high command wanted the duo to be present. ?They may have skipped the meeting to protest against growing infighting,? he added.

 Chowdhury had earlier criticised Mitra and a section of the party based in Calcutta for creating rifts.

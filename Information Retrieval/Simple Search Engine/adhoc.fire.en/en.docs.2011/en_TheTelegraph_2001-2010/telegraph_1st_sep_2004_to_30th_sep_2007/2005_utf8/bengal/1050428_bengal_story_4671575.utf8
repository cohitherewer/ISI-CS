 Shadow falls on ?sunrise? sector

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 Calcutta, April 27: A high 

 attrition rate, an ever-widening skill gap, anomalies in 

 taxation and bottlenecks in transport infrastructure are 

 among the major problems stifling the growth of the business 

 process outsourcing (BPO) industry in Calcutta.

 A recent survey, on the basis of in-depth interviews conducted among representatives of 10 leading BPO companies, by the city-based Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has highlighted these weaknesses, along with a few strengths, of the fledgling industry.

 ?The study takes an in-depth look at the issues and prospects of ITES firms located here. The focus is on key areas related to doing business in this sector besides looking at its potential, needs and prospects of sustained profitability,? said Umang Kanoria, president, ICC.

 According to the qualitative research ?billed as the first such exercise covering the local BPO industry ? is an attempt to understand the state of affairs in chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s ?sunrise industry?. 

 The report will be released on April 30, coinciding with the launch of an IT and ITES forum ? VOICE IT, Vitalising IT amp; Communications in the East.

 One of the most acute problems facing the companies in Calcutta is the palpable skill gap. A combination of factors like lack of training facilities, high attrition rates and migration of skilled people to other cities has led to a demand-supply mismatch.

 Stressing the importance of training ? both soft skills and technical capabilities ? and its short supply in the city, the survey mentioned how Calcutta (with around 30 to 35 training centres) was lagging way behind Bangalore (with more than 170 centres).

 Bikram Dasgupta of Globsyn, which has a BPO training academy apart from its software business, sided with the survey findings, adding that the industry must mature in order to address these problems.

 ?The industry must properly define its requirements and communicate that to the people and only then will the supply side start gearing up. Employment advertisements seeking proficiency in English for a BPO career can never achieve that objective,? said Dasgupta.

 The other elements on the long list of concerns include frequent bandhs, poor public transport facility in Sector V, physical stress on employees, social pressure on employees doing night shifts, and absence of standardisation in facilities and taxation issues.

 ?Section 2(b) of the State Tax on Consumption of Use of Goods Act, 2001, clearly lays down that ITES companies are exempted from consumption tax on computer hardware, computer peripherals and other capital goods. But many firms have allegedly been compelled to pay such taxes,? mentioned the report.

 According to Nazeeb Arif, secretary general, ICC, the interview sessions with representatives of the BPO industry triggered the decision to set up the VOICE IT forum.

 ?These are local industry issues and though we have a proactive government, the need for an industry forum cannot be overemphasised,? said Arif.

 He added that the chamber has plans to put in place an action plan on the basis of the findings and steer them through VOICE IT.

 From facilitating IT and ITES industry?s interaction with other sectors to lobbying the government for policies and developing structured training modules to identifying new business opportunities, the new forum hopes to play an active role.

 ?The ultimate aim is to have more home-grown success stories,? summed up Arif.

 Murder anger on Congress 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Hanskhali (Nadia), Jan. 29: Angered by the murder of CPM activist Swapan Biswas, his colleagues today went on a rampage pulling down shops and ransacking the house of a Congress leader and two party offices at Hanskhali, about 70 km from Calcutta. 

 Biswas was shot last night near Bogula station when he and three associates were returning home. Biswas, brother of a CPM Hanskhali zonal committee member, died on the spot. The other three are battling for life at the Saktinagar district hospital in Krishnagar. 

 Around 10 am, CPM activists began a protest march. They demonstrated at Hanskhali police station, demanding the arrest of the culprits. 

 Later, around 500 activists attacked the house of Sasanka Biswas, a senior Congress leader and president of the Hanskhali panchayat samity. ?Biswas would have been killed if he had been present at his residence when armed CPM members attacked. We wonder how the police deployed there remained silent spectators,? complained Shankar Singh, the Nadia Congress president. 

 He attributed the murder to gang rivalry and said his party had nothing to do with the killing. 

 The CPM also called a snap 12-hour bandh and stopped buses from plying on the Hanskhali road since morning. They also held up local trains in the Ranaghat section for hours. 

 Police superintendent Benoy Chakraborty, who is camping in the area, said three men have been rounded up in connection with the murder.

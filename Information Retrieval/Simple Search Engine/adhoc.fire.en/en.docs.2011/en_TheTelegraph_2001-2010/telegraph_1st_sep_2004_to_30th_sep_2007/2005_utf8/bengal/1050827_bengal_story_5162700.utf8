 Wife told to bear torture

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, Aug. 26: The 17-year-old girl in Kolaghat who was raped by her 65-year-old father-in-law for two years since marriage was repeatedly told to bear with it by her husband and mother-in-law.

 Feroze Khan, who is absconding, had apparently confessed to his crime before Golam Rasul, a panchayat leader at Denangram who tried to settle the matter. 

 After being beaten up by villagers, Feroz fled.

 Last Wednesday, the victim, accompanied by some of the villagers, filed an FIR with police. Her husband Abdulla and mother-in-law Anjum Begum were arrested last night. They were remanded in a fortnights judicial custody today.

 Anjum and Abdulla, a small trader who has to stay away from home frequently, apparently knew about Ferozes crime, the police said.

 East Midnapore police chief Ashoke Dutta said: We are looking for the father-in-law. 

 The mother of a year-old son attempted suicide at Kolaghat station on August 6 after being raped the day before. Local people saved her. 

 On August 9, she went to the Kolaghat police station but merely complained of torture by in-laws. An officer listened to her and advised her to approach the panchayat.

 Boats stuck in raging sea

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, July 29: About 40 fishermen are stranded in turbulent high seas since four trawlers developed snags around 80 km south-west of Digha yesterday.

 They were part of a fleet of about 70 trawlers that sailed from Shankarpur on Wednesday to catch Hilsa. This time of the year, about 4,000 trawlers cast their nets in the Bay of Bengal. Pradyut Pahari, a senior officer at the Shankarpur harbour, said one of the trawlers became immobile after its net got entangled with the propeller. The others developed problems in their engines.

 Communication with the boats has snapped. 

 The Coast Guard has sent a Dornier aircraft and a vessel to locate and rescue the fishermen. The sea is extremely rough and our rescue vessel will take some time to reach. The aircraft is in operation, commandant G. Singh said. 

 The Met office said a depression has formed on north Bay of Bengal and fishermen are advised not to go into the sea.

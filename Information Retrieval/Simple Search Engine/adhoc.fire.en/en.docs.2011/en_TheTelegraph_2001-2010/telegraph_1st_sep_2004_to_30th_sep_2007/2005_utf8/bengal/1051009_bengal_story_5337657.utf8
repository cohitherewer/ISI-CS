 Stem cell store coming to town

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 8: With stem cell harvesting slowly making inroads in the city, there is hope for children who have inherited chronic ailments.

 A day after The Telegraph reported the first recorded stem cell preservation case in Calcutta, two more couples decided to safeguard their newborns life by preserving stem cells for future use. 

 A team of experts will take out blood samples from the umbilical cords during the two deliveries tomorrow. 

 Stem cells developed from cord blood has gained popularity the world over and people in Calcutta are also realising its importance. Diseases like thalassaemia will now be much easier to treat, said Subrata Chatterjee, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Bhagirathi Neotia Woman and Child Care Centre. 

 He had carried out a surgery yesterday to help deliver a healthy baby. About 110 ml of blood was drawn from the babys umbilical cord for preservation at a Chennai centre.

 Thalassaemia patients need blood transfusion and, sometimes, ineffective transfusion causes iron overload, which can be fatal, said paediatrician Tridib Banerjee. 

 Doctors are now looking at stem cell therapy through cell transplantation that would eventually help the body produce enough red blood cells. 

 An umbilical cord blood transplant can be looked upon as a cheaper and more reliable substitute for bone marrow transplant. 

 Buoyed by the response from Calcutta, the Chennai-based Asia Cryo Cell has finalised plans to set up a special centre by mid-November. 

 Within days, six couples from Calcutta have enrolled with us for stem cell preservation. We will soon be in the city with a full-fledged team, said Prasad Mangipudi, the vice-president (marketing) of Asia Cryo Cell. 

 The company is going to open the countrys first stem cell transplantation hospital in Chennai by next year.

 Anil talks of third front amp; ?anti-people? Centre

 - Once foe, now friend, Congress keeps Left busy

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 1: The CPM today revived the call for a ?third front of secular democratic parties? minus the Congress, its ally at the Centre. 

 ?We want the third front to grow and survive on the basis of some specific political programmes and common understanding among its constituents,? state CPM secretary Anil Biswas said today. 

 He elaborated on how he expected the front to work. ?Take the case of the Left Front in our state. It was not formed just to contest elections but to implement some common political programmes. We want the third front at the Centre to grow in line with the ruling coalition in Bengal.?

 Biswas said grievances against the Congress-led coalition in Delhi are on the rise because of its ?anti-people? policies. 

 Though the Left parties have reaffirmed their support to the Manmohan Singh government time and again, they have also raised objections to many of the Centre?s policies ? the latest being the decision to allow non-government provident and pension funds to invest in stocks. 

 ?Communal forces like the BJP will work hard to exploit the situation and we don?t think that the Congress-led government will take any firm stand against such religious fundamentalists. Naturally, the Leftists would have to fight communalism and fundamentalism? So, we have to organise all secular forces under one umbrella,? Biswas said.

 The CPM in Bengal, he added, will have to play a lead role in reorganising the third front at the national level as the party has the experience of running a coalition of like-minded parties for the past 27 years. 

 However, he also added that the revival of the third front could take some time. 

 The party?s 21st state conference, beginning February 9 at Kamarhati ? on the northern fringes of the city ? will approve of the CPM state committee?s resolution to carry on the fight against the Congress in Bengal.

 The political and organisational reports finalised by the committee during its recent two-day meeting would also be given the nod.

 The CPM has been striving to make its relations with the Congress clear to its cadre. The Opposition party in the state is a partner in Delhi.

 Biswas said: ?Our support to the Congress in Delhi was not unconditional. We extended support to them on the basis of a minimum programme. In Bengal, we are very opposed to the Congress.?

 In an apparent bid to leave no ambiguity regarding the CPM?s opposition to the Congress, Biswas also said: ?We studied the role played by the Congress in Bengal over the past three years and concluded that the party is a partner of the Trinamul Congress-BJP combine...?

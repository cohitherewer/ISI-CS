 Study suggests shuffle 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 4: Rationalising fleets, routes and staff hold the key to the revival of the state transport corporations, says a report suggesting ways to breathe life into them.

 In the new scheme of things, Calcutta State Transport Corporation (CSTC) could be made in charge of all operations in greater Calcutta, including the bus service to Bangladesh. That would mean it would also run the Calcutta Tramway Company (CTC) buses. 

 CSTC will also procure low-floor buses to augment its fleet for city operations. 

 The North Bengal State Transport Corporation will manage operations in north Bengal, northern Bihar and Assam, while the South Bengal State Transport Corporation will be in charge of south Bengal, excluding Calcutta. The West Bengal State Transport Corporation, according to the report, should be merged with the rest, while CTC should be concerned only with running trams. 

 The government had appointed a consortium of consultants for the study to devise ways to revamp and restructure the units. The five transport undertakings, which employ about 22,000 people, got a Rs 220-crore subsidy last year.

 The study has suggested voluntary retirement for at least 6,200 employees ? mostly drivers and conductors too old to work on buses. The government plans to use British funds for the restructuring.

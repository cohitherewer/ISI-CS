 Symbol cloud survives list

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 15: The list is out but the confusion is still staying put.

 The allotment of symbols to candidates was mired in a muddle even after mayor Subrata Mukherjees Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha announced a list of 38 candidates for the June 19 civic elections. 

 According to the seat adjustments, while the Party for Democratic Socialism (PDS) will contest in six wards (46, 99, 104, 105, 109 and 110), Sharad Pawars Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) will field its nominees in two, 8 and 136. Mulayam Singh Yadavs Samajwadi Party (SP) will put up its lone nominee in ward 133.

 Mukherjee said tonight the Mancha would not interfere with the selection of symbols for its allies. 

 Though a majority of our 38 candidates will fight the elections on the NCPs clock symbol, we shall not interfere if some contest on other symbols, he said.

 Paresh Pal, the rebel Trinamul Congress MLA from Manicktala, for example, has expressed his willingness to contest on the Congresss hand symbol, he added.

 Debashis Kumar, a Mancha candidate from ward 85, has decided to contest on a double leaf (jorapata) symbol as an Independent candidate. 

 Officials from the state election commission said tonight that those contesting on the clock symbol would be treated as the NCPs candidates. In that case, the symbol certificate will have to be signed by NCP officials. 

 Those contesting on symbols other than the NCPs clock and the Samajwadis cycle would be treated as Independents.

 PDS leader Samir Putatunda said the partys six candidates would contest on a free symbol that will be made available by the poll panel.

 Trinamul leader Mamata Banerjee, addressing an election rally at Bongaon in North 24-Parganas late this afternoon, said her party would do away with the water tax if it wins the municipal polls.

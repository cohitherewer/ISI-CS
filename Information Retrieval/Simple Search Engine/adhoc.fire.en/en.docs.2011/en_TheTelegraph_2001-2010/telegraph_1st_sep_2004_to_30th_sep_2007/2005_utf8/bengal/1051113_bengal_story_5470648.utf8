 Santiniketan tour guide in molest net

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Santiniketan, Nov. 12: A tourist guide has been arrested in Santiniketan after a group of schoolgirls accused him of molestation.

 Ashok Bhowmik, around 40, was arrested yesterday after he allegedly grabbed a Class IV student of Patha Bhavan on the Visva-Bharati University campus when she and some other students, about to go on a tour, were waiting for the school bus around 10.45 am. 

 Guide kaku tied her mouth with a handkerchief when she tried to shout and tried to drag her towards the campus gate, said another student Sucharita Sen, who was present at the spot.

 A jhalmuri vendor raised an alarm and Bhowmik let the girl go. By then, the bus had arrived and her friends pushed the horrified girl into it.

 He does that to us almost every day when we wait for the bus. Many of my friends have faced this, Sucharita said. He threatens to kill us if we tell anyone.

 But yesterday the students mustered the courage to inform Patha Bhavan adhy-aksa (headmistress) Bodhirupa Singha about the harassment and threats. 

 A complaint was lodged with the security department.

 Our staff took a student, who was witness to the incident, for identification. They finally tracked him (Bhowmik) on the campus, said Arup Sil, security officer of Visva-Bharati. The guide was caught and detained at the Visva-Bharati office till police reached.

 An FIR was lodged with Bolpur police station, around 195 km from Calcutta, officials of Visva-Bharatis security department said today. 

 Similar charges had been brought against Bhowmik earlier, too, but he was not arrested, they added.

 In the third week of September, a teacher of the agr- iculture department of the university had lodged a complaint with the security department alleging that Bhowmik had harassed his daughter, Sil said. An FIR was also filed.

 Birbhum superintendent of police Sanjay Singh said: We have initiated a case against Bhowmik on a molestation charge. He is now being interrogated.

 Other tourist guides were critical of Bhowmik. He had harassed minors several times earlier, too. We had castigated him a month ago because of this. We dont even talk to him, said Manik Biswas, a tourist guide.

 Siliguri, July 11: Tea gardens in north Bengal will suffer a loss of about Rs 20 crore everyday as around 5 lakh workers ? involved directly or indirectly ? in 1,800 estates in the Dooars, Jalpaiguri, Darjeeling and North Dinajpur began an indefinite strike today.

 The small tea growers and bought-leaf factories stayed outside the ceasework. Tea labourers of North Dinajpur said they would resume work from tomorrow, after a days token strike today to express their solidarity with their counterparts in other parts of the region. 

 Our coordination committee will again meet on July13 to take a decision on the future course of action. The workers have been forced to go on the strike, to protest against the neglect by planters and lack of any positive step from the government, said Alok Chakraborty, the assistant secretary of the National Union of Plantation Workers.

 The Defence Committee for Plantation Workers Rights, an umbrella organisation of 18 trade unions that is spearheading the agitation, has thanked the workers for making a success of the first-days programme. We will continue with the strike tomorrow as well, said Samir Roy, its convenor.

 The deadlock on wage revision has persisted despite many rounds of tripartite talks among the workers unions, owners lobby and the state government. While the labour unions demanded an increase in basic wages, planters remained firm on their stand of implementing productivity-linked wages. 

 The workers demanded a revision of the wage scale since it has not been revised after the last agreement expired in March 2003. Most of the recommendations of the one-man Sabyasachi Sen committee, set up to introduce improvements in the industry, have not been implemented, even though they were formulated last August. 

 This (the on-going strike) is not a happy situation for us. The apparent loss to the tea gardens is about Rs 7 crore, but the cumulative loss would be much higher, said P.K. Bhattacharya, the secretary of the Dooars Branch of the Indian Tea Association.

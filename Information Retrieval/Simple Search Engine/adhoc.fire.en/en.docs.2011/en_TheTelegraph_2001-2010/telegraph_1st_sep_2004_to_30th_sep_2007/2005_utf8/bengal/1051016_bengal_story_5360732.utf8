 Youth beaten to death for spitting 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 15: Bhola Rais only crime was that he spat in front of his landlords grocery store. For this, the shopowner and his three sons beat the 25-year-old so badly that he died in hospital.

 Police have arrested three of the accused.

 On Wednesday morning, Bhola, a resident of Rani Rashmoni Road was brushing his teeth as usual. Strolling in front of his home he spat near a drain in front of Raj Bhander, the grocery shop. 

 The act incensed landlord Santosh Gupta, 50, and his sons ? Rajesh, 22, Lalit, 20 and Ashish, 18. They caught Bhola and started beating him. Despite his many apologies, the four dragged him on to the road beat him with bamboo sticks. 

 Bholas cries alerted his brother Kapil, who rushed to his aid but was pushed aside by Gupta and his sons. Bhola soon lost consciousness and lay bleeding on the road. The attackers left the scene and one of them has also managed to escape arrest.

 The scene was horrific as they dragged my brother on the road and started beating, punching and kicking him. Later, they brought bamboo sticks and the beating continued, as Bhola started bleeding. My brother apologised and begged for mercy but they would not listen, wept Kapil. 

 Since they are wealthy people and also our landlords, no one dared to stop them. It is hard for us to accept that my brother was punished to death simply because he spat in front of the shop. What will I tell his wife and two children?

 Bhola, a small-time businessman dealing in various consumer items, suffered injuries to his head and stomach. He was taken to the Medical College and Hospital and admitted to the emergency ward. He died last night. 

 A complaint has been lodged at the New Market police station by Bholas relatives. Yesterday, sleuths arrested Rajesh and Lalit. Ashish is absconding. 

 The brothers were remanded in police custody till October 17. Later, Santosh Gupta was also arrested from the port area. 

 We are conducting raids to arrest the fourth accused and brother of Rajesh and Lalit. They have all been charged with murder, said Hiren Dey, the officer-in-charge of New Market police station.

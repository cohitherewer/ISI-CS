 Van with dead man caught in fishing net 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, Oct. 23: A matador van was today fished out of a canal at Randiha, a remote village in Burdwan, with a decomposed body in the drivers cabin. 

 A group of local fishermen had as usual cast their net in the Damodar Valley Corporations Left Bank Canal, about 150 km from Calcutta, around 5.30 pm. 

 They initially thought that they had ensnared a big shoal of fish, but realised it was not the case when the net tore. One of the fishermen dived into the water to find out that it was a matador van on the bed of the canal. 

 The fishermen informed police, who brought a crane and engaged labourers to pull out the lorry. 

 The body, of a man of about 35, has yet to be identified. We have sent it for post-mortem. An investigation has begun on the basis of the vans registration number, said Anand Kumar, the Durgapur additional superintendent of police. The vehicle was registered in Burdwan.

 As the news spread, people from Randiha and adjacent villages converged on the banks of the irrigation canal. 

 It is very mysterious. There is a kutcha road along the canal. But that road is hardly used by heavy vehicles. The nearest possible road from which the van might have slipped into the (Damodar) river is Durgapur Barrage, which is some 25 km from where the vehicle was fished out. It is next to impossible for the canal to carry such a heavy vehicle so far away, said an investigating officer. 

 Ive never heard of such a thing in my life. Somebody must have murdered the man, put him in the drivers cabin and pushed the van over the banks into the canal, said a local CPM leader and member of Chaktentul gram panchayat, Barun Das.

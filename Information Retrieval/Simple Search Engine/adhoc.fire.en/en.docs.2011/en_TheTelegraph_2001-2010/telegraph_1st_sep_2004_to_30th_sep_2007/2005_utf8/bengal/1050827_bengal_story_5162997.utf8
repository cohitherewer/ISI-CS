 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Aug. 26: Rattled by recurrent power cuts, the health department today called the principals and hospital superintendents of the medical colleges in the city and asked them to submit a blueprint of steps to be taken to ensure there was no such crisis in the future.

 Director of medical education Jayshree Mitra asked the hospital authorities to identify spots where the CESC could set up separate transformers, if necessary. The RG Kar authorities were asked to arrange generators to ensure there was no repeat of last nights fiasco when the hospital was plunged into darkness and patients awaiting emergency operations had to be shifted elsewhere.

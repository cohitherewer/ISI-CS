 Silver dreams go bust

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

Krishnagar, Jan. 6: Stars in eyes, three girls 

between 12 and 13 years dreamt of making it to the reverie retail shop, Bollywood.

 With Rs 30 between them, Pampa Chakraborty, Champa Chandra and Tumpa Haldar ? residents of Sutragar in Shantipur, about 70 km from Calcutta ? left home on Tuesday. 

 Fate, however, interrupted their ?rise to stardom?. They boarded the wrong train and were back home last evening.

 Pampa is a Class VIII student. Champa and Tumpa are in Class VII of the same institution, Sutragar Girl?s High School.

 Police said they idolised actors Raveena Tandon, Kajol and Rani Mukherjee. 

 All of them left home around 10 on Tuesday morning saying they were going to school and would be late to return after visiting their private tutors on the way back.

 They made their way to Shantipur station instead and boarded a Sealdah-bound local.

 From Sealdah, they took a bus to Howrah, hoping to catch a train to Mumbai. 

 Fortunately, they knew little about train schedules and which went to Mumbai.

 An officer of the Shantipur police station said: ?They boarded the Panskura local.?

 On the train, a middle-aged woman from Uluberia spotted the three girls looking about aimlessly. ?She struck up a conversation, and soon realised what they were up to,? said additional police superintendent of police Biswarup Ghosh.

 The woman tried to counsel them and point out their mistake. She took them to her house and informed the Government Railway Police. The same night, the GRP took the girls into their custody and got in touch with the Shantipur police station. 

 The girls, whose fathers had gone to the police to register missing complaints, were escorted home last evening. From middle-class weavers? families, they had hatched their plan days ago. Pampa, the eldest, had talked to them of her brother Gopal, an autorickshaw driver in Mumbai. 

 ?She often said it was a matter of time before she went to Mumbai to be an actress. Champa and Tumpa disbelieved, but when Pampa told them last Sunday that she was off to Mumbai and would settle down there, they could not resist,? Ghosh said.

 Champa?s father Biswanath Chandra said his daughter told him that Pampa could easily be an actress. He also admitted that she had often talked of becoming an actress herself. ?But never imagined this.?

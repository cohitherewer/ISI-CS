 Bloody end to shopping for goddess

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Oct. 16: A man killed his wife of 25 years in a village near here this morning after he spotted her speaking to some local youths.

 Santana Das, 40, went to shop for Lakshmi Puja with her husband Narayan, 50, around 9 this morning. 

 At the Mayurhat village market in Hanskhali, about 70 km from Calcutta, she was accused of smiling at some of the younger men, police said.

 Narayan, a small trader, dragged her home around 10. The abusing began when they were yet to reach home.

 Once inside, the beating began. When Santana protested and dubbed Narayan jealous, he took a knife from the kitchen and began stabbing her. She shouted for help, but was overpowered. 

 Her two sons, both rickshaw-pullers, were out for work then. Their wives, too, were not at home.

 A senior Nadia police officer said Narayan repeatedly stabbed his wife. 

 When Santana slumped on the floor, Narayan sensed trouble and began to run. Neighbours gave him a chase, he added.

 Narayan ran to the Churni river, a kilometre away, and swam to the other bank. About 100 villagers jumped into the river and swam after him. The mob soon caught up with him and started beating him up.

 A police team from a local camp rescued Narayan and took him into custody. 

 The daughters-in-law, Aduri and Anima, later said Santana did not ever have any extramarital relationship with anyone. But still our father-in-law suspected her. She always behaved well with the local people and so she was extremely popular in the neighbourhood.

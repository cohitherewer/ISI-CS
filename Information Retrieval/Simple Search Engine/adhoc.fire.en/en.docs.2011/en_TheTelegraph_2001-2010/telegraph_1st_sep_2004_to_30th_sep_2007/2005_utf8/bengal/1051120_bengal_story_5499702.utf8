 Truant doctors back

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 19: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today sought a report about nine doctors of BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children going on leave at the same time leaving two colleagues to treat 700 patients.

 The chief minister and the health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra wanted to know about it, health department officials said.

 The doctors were today asked to get their act right. Director of medical education Jayashree Mitra held a long meeting with them at the hospital and sent across the message that in future, there should be proper justification for taking leave. The meeting, Mitra said, was satisfactory and that the doctors had expressed regret.

 Yesterday, nine out of 11 senior doctors took leave at a time, throwing the outpatient and emergency sections out of gear. On hearing that three of their colleagues had taken leave, six other doctors apparently stayed away for fear of having to treat too many patients.

 Children in despair stood in queue for long hours and the hospital superintendent himself had to treat some of them to keep the situation from getting out of hand. The resident medical officers and post-graduate trainees were also pressed into service.

 With all doctors present, normality was restored at the outpatient and emergency departments today. The problems have been sorted out, said Mrinal Kanti Chatterjee, the superintendent.

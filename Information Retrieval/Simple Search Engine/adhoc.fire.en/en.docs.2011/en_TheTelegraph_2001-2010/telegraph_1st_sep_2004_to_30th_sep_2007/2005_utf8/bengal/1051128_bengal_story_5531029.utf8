 Warrant mission hits wall

 OUR BUREAU

 Nov. 27: The Election Commissions 

 plans to bar criminals from voting or contesting has run 

 into an administrative hurdle.

 The state administration has failed to identify most of the people against whom arrest warrants are pending.

 The commission wants the names of people who are absconding taken off the electoral rolls. According to the poll panels directive, summons must be sent to people who have warrants pending against them. If they fail to appear before the local Electoral Registration Officer (ERO) in seven days, their names have to be struck off.

 However, notices have been issued to only 11,731 of the 72,000 names in the state as most of them cannot be traced. 

 Till now, the success rate in tracking down these people has been only 17 per cent. Since a majority of them couldnt be located at the addresses mentioned in the police files, we have taken up the matter with the state home department. We are seeking more details and accurate information from the police on the absconders, chief electoral officer Debashish Sen said in Calcutta.

 Sens department has requested the police to provide relevant information to the ERO within seven days of his seeking it.

 Howrah has the poorest record in tracking down absconders. West Midnapore has the most warrants pending, but it also boasts of the best record in identifying culprits.

 Nadia district magistrate Rajesh Pandey said most accused had given false names to the police when cases were started against them, which led to the mess.

 However, Nadia superintendent 

 of police R. Rajshekharan is not convinced. The arrest 

 warrants were issued by the court only after we submitted 

 chargesheets against the accused. Chargesheets are submitted 

 only after thorough investigations. I am surprised how such 

 a thing can take place.

 Pending warrants: Around 72,000

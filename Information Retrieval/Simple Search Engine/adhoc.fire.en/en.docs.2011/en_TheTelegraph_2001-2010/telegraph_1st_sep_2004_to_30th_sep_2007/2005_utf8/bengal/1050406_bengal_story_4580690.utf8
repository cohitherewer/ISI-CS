 Family spat salve from police 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, April 5: Police help to resolve marital spats and family discord can now be had in West Midnapore minus the ordeal of a trip to the police station.

 To cope with a rush of complaints that have little to do with law and order, the district police have decided to open family counselling centres. One such centre, Disha, has started functioning in Kharagpur. Plans are afoot to open similar centres in all subdivisions. 

 ?Every police station will be asked to utilise the Kharagpur helpline,? said superintendent of police Ajoy Nanda. 

 The centres will comprise teachers and women?s representatives. The police stations will take their suggestions in resolving the disputes. 

 Nanda said: ?There is an increasing tendency to rush to the police over petty family quarrels. These cases drag on and add to our workload.?

 An officer said 25 per cent of cases registered relate to petty family disputes. Often, there are requests from the complainants to withdraw cases after they have been registered. ?But that is impossible. Once a case is started, it is for the court to take a decision,? said the district police chief.

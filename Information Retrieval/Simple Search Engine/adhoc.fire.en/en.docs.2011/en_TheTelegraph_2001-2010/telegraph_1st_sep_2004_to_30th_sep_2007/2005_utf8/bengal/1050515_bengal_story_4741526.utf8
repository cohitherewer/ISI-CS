 Pranab truce bid fails

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, May 14: The impasse over finalisation of the United Democratic Alliances candidates for the municipal elections continued today with state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee failing to bring a rapprochement between mayor Subrata Mukherjee and former Bengal party chief Somen Mitra.

 The defence minister held a meeting of the state Congress election committee here this morning and later met the mayor at his south Calcutta residence.

 The state party chief put up a brave front, saying the names of nominees would be announced tomorrow. All the hurdles will be removed by that time, he said.

 Mitra, who has opposed the mayors decision to field candidates of the Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha for wards 48, 55 and 63, told the state party chief that he could not accept them even if they contested the elections on the hand symbol of the Congress, said sources.

 Under no circumstances will we accept Subratas nominees for these three wards for which our party has already chosen its candidates. I will not bow down under any pressure, come what may, Mitra told The Telegraph tonight.

 Rajya Sabha member Jayanta Bhattacharya, who attended the meeting of the Congress poll panel, described the three wards as the partys bastions.

 The mayor rejected the Congresss proposal of contesting the polls on the hand symbol, saying he and many other candidates of his organisation have already put up graffiti with the clock symbol of the Nationalist Congress Party.

 However, I would not mind if my candidates for the three wards fight the polls on the hand symbol, he said.

 The candidates ? Amiya Mukhopadhyay, Dipali Das and Ramen Pande ? have been chosen after considerable thought. It is not possible for us to ask them to withdraw and make room for Congress candidates, he said. 

 In contrast to this feuding that delayed the announcement of candidates names, the Trinamul Congress decided to project former CPM parliamentarian Radhika Ranjan Pramanik as the chairman candidate for the Bidhannagar municipal elections, to be held on June 19 along with the Calcutta Municipal Corporation polls. The CPM has fielded Biswajiban Majumdar, a former principal of Gurudas College, as its nominee for chairman.

 Pramanik, who was the MP from Mathurapur for four consecutive terms, quit the CPM last year before the Lok Sabha polls. He contested the Parliament polls on a Trinamul ticket, but lost to a CPM nominee.

 We are projecting Pramanik as our partys chairman candidate as the CPM has fielded a heavyweight like Majumdar, said Trinamul legislator Arunava Ghosh.

 Majumdar will contest from ward 15, which had returned outgoing CPM chairman Dilip Gupta, while Pramanik will try to bag ward 6. Gupta is not contesting the polls.

 All 23 Left Front candidates today filed their nominations at the subdivisional office at Mayukh Bhavan.

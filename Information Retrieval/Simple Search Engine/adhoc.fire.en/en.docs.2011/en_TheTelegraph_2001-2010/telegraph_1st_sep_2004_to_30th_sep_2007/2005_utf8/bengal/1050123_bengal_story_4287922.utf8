 ?Adhir takes time to let us know his decision by tomorrow when I requested him to withdraw his resignation. I will be able to give you a clear picture on this score by tomorrow,? Mukherjee told news persons tonight , waiting at the circuit house.

 He said a PCC team will visit the district to probe the allegations against 10 party commissioners, owing allegiance to Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Atish Sinha, for moving a no-confidence in the municipality chairman, Nilratan Auddy.

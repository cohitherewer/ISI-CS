 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, July 12: The secondary education board today withdrew its approval on Madhyamik Bhasha Shandhan, a Bengali grammar book for classes IX and X.

 The textbook written by Pabitra Sarkar and Ganesh Basu ? introduced as part of a new syllabus this academic year ? allegedly contained insulting comments on teachers and politicians. School education minister Kanti Biswas said: It wont be taught anymore. The publisher has been asked to stop selling it. Board secretary Swapan Bhattacharya wrote to Granthatirtha, the publisher, that parts of it transgressed the boundaries of decency. 

 Purulia: Three members of a family, including a pregnant Buni Bauri, 28, were killed when the ambulance carrying her lost control and hit a tree late on Monday night. Bunis mother Mangala Bauri, 47, her sister- in-law Laboni and the driver of the vehicle were also killed, 8 km from Bankura town and about 200 km from Calcutta. 

 Suri: Passengers of a bus on way to Suri from Bolpur were looted on Tuesday evening. The dacoits, who disguised themselves as passengers, brandished revolvers near Debagram, 220 km from Calcutta. A man who tried to resist was stabbed. Police said the gang of eight took away Rs 1 lakh and jewellery.

 Money-bag for wildlife whistleblowers

 SWATI SENGUPTA

 Calcutta, Aug. 28: The government wants to offer up to Rs 10,000 to those who tip it off about poachers and wildlife smugglers.

 The reward might appear meagre compared with the money involved in the trade, but forest minister Jogesh Barman said the intention is to create a network of informers. 

 Wildlife trade across the world is estimated to be worth $25 billion annually, reportedly next in value only to narcotics and arms trafficking. That a good part of such smuggling has its roots in India became evident after the Sariska reserve in Rajasthan was found to have been robbed of all its tigers earlier this year. 

 Barman said information leading to seizures or arrest would fetch reward. The informers would be part of a growing network that we intend to develop and hope it will give good results, he added. 

 The system is being introduced on the lines of the secret source fund that is used by police, customs, and similar agencies. A forest department official said the identity of informers would be kept secret.

 Skins of tiger and leopard, ivory and horns of one-horned rhinos are the most commonly traded wildlife goods from Bengal. The state also provides transit for consignments headed to Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh.

 A senior forest department official said: We feel the system would lead to lot more seizures and prevent poaching. The financial reward will act as an incentive for people living in and around the forests.

 Forest villagers, with their knowledge of terrain and animal habitats, are often said to be hand in glove with the poachers. 

 Now, the West Bengal Forest Development Corporation offers rewards up to Rs 20,000. But the present decision means money in addition to that offered by the corporation.

 Capturing, hunting and any kind of trade of wild animals or animal parts are banned and punishable under the Wildlife Protection Act.

 Reports of poaching and animal part seizures, though, are common. On Friday, a bag thought to be packed with explosives lying unattended in Dum Dum metro station yielded tusks worth over Rs 1 lakh.

 Leopard and tiger skins and rhino horns being taken to Nepal and Assam from north India were seized in north Bengal earlier.

 The smuggled items fetch very high prices in Southeast Asia, China, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan.

 In India, tiger skins have a ready market and sell for anything upwards of Rs 100,000.

 The horn of the rhino, found in north Bengal and Assam, is also much sought after. In Southeast Asia, the horn is said to have medicinal value, though nothing has been established scientifically. 

 Once the Bengal government announces its reward scheme, officials will pass on the information to people to make them aware of it. 

 The new reward process, an official said, is much simpler than the one existing. After the scheme comes into effect, chief wildlife wardens can sanction the reward on recommendations of divisional forest officers.

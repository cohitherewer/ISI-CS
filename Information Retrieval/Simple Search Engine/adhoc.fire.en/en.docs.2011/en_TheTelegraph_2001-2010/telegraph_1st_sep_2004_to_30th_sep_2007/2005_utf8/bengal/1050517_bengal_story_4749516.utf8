 CPM bleeds in south

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhangor, May 16: Kalipada Naskar, a CPM leader in South 24-Parganas, was shot through the neck and slit in the throat before the assailants chopped off his fingers last night. 

 A popular leader of the farmers wing here in South 24-Parganas, about 60 km from Calcutta, Naskar was cycling home after a party meeting around 10 when attacked.

 As he fell to the ground after being shot, the miscreants slit his throat and cut four fingers off his left hand. A local youth, who found Naskar lying in blood, raised an alarm. 

 Doctors at a local hospital declared him dead.

 The local CPM leadership today called a 12-hour bandh in the area demanding immediate arrest of those involved in last nights attack. Land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah, also a leader of the CPMs peasants wing, came here during the day. 

 South 24-Parganas has been witness to bloody political deaths before. On most occasions, the victims party has accused its opponent of plotting the murder and sometimes even an ally. Mollah pointed fingers at the Trinamul Congress.

 Shakti Mondal, a district Trinamul leader, scoffed at the allegation. Our party has nothing to do with the ghastly incident. It is an outcome of the CPMs infighting, he said.

 Three CPM functionaries ? a panchayat member of Tardah village and a Bhangor panchayat samiti member, among them ? have been killed in the past three months. 

 We have intensified vigil following the rise in political murders, said A.K. Prasad, the additional superintendent of police, rural. 

 A local resident, Nazrul Mollah, was picked up in connection with Naskars murder. We do not know his political identity. We are conducting further raids to arrest the others involved in the crime. A sniffer dog has also been pressed into service, Prasad said. Baruipur subdivisional police officer Sisir Das patrolled the area as tension ran high.

 Naskar, survived by his wife and three sons, owned about three bighas and had joined the CPM in 1967. The minister, who visited his family, said: He was senior to me in the party. He had earned Trinamuls ire for protesting against anti-social activities. He had been beaten up by Trinamul workers during the panchayat polls and was the partys target.

 Funds for flood districts

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 3: The government today announced a Rs 50-crore package for two of the most flood-prone districts in the state. 

 Finance minister Asim Dasgupta said his department has sanctioned Rs 25 crore for dredging in the Ichhamati river, while Rs 24 crore will be spent on an embankment on the Ganga to prevent erosion in several blocks of Malda district.

 The Ichhamati originates in Bangladesh and flows into India at Majdia in Nadia district, terminating in the Sunderbans. The river, heavily silted, inundates almost every year about 430 moujas in Basirhat, Gaighata, Bagda, Bongaon and Gaighata in North 24-Parganas. After a deluge in October, several parts of the district remained waterlogged for weeks.

 According to officials, floods affect nearly 10 lakh people every year in the district and has destroyed crops worth about Rs 600 crore over the past five years.

 ?The dredging will have to be conducted along 25 km of the river ? from Berigopalpur to Tetulia Setu in Basirhat. Tenders will be called soon and work will start in February. We want to complete the work in six months,? Dasgupta said.

 Illegal constructions on the riverbank will also be demolished, the minister added.

 Men and machines will be on the job even during monsoon, he promised.

 The Rs 24-crore project to construct a 3-km bundh on the Ganga at Panchanandapur in Malda ?is targeted for completion before monsoon?, Dasgupta said. ?The irrigation department says a bundh here is needed urgently.?

 Terming the erosion along the Ganga a ?national problem?, the minister said: ?Even after building this bundh, we need another Rs 10 crore to build another embankment in Malda.?

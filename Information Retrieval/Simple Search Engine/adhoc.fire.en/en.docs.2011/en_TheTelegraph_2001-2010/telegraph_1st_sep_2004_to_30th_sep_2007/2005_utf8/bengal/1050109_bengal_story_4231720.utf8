 Industry looks to PM for a pep-up

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Manmohan Singh

Calcutta, Jan. 8: The last time the city hosted a Prime Minister, on July 17, 2003, during the 150th anniversary of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industries, Atal Bihari Vajpayee questioned why Bengal?s industry had slipped from the pole position to the rear. 

 The sudden salvo from Vajpayee had the Left leaders sulking while the industry captains kept mum. 

 But as the city?s business community prepares to welcome Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on his first visit to the city on January 12, no one is expecting a repeat of July last year. 

 Instead, there are expectations that the economist-turned-politician will appreciate the state government?s efforts to effect an economic turnaround and will facilitate the process. 

 ?The industry?s interest in the state has increased manifold in recent times and people like Azim Premji are bullish on Bengal. The state?s economic growth figures have also been recognised by agencies like the World Bank. Now, if the Prime Minister also talks about it, it will do a world of good for Bengal?s branding,? said a leading industrialist. 

 Singh will be here to inaugurate the Confederation of Indian Industry?s flagship event, Partnership Summit, 2005.

 The three-day event, between January 12 and 14, will be attended by a clutch of CEOs and around 1,000 delegates from India and abroad. 

 ?With so many international delegates coming to attend the event, it will give a great opportunity to the state to showcase its strengths. We are coordinating with the government departments to extend all the necessary support,? said Amitabh Khosla, the director of CII?s eastern region.

 Realising the potential, the state government with the chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee leading from the front, is ready to play a perfect host to the visitors and will meet some of the delegates on the sidelines of the meet. 

 The organisers of the meet ? for which a ?special venue? the National Library has been chosen to host part of the show ? claimed that it would draw significant international participation. 

 According to the CII secretariat in the city, confirmations have come in from the US, the UK, Singapore, Canada, South Africa, China and Malaysia. 

 And not just business leaders, the event will also bring politicians and senior government officials from both India and abroad. 

 ?If the Prime Minister, who is known for his plainspeak and is held in high esteem by the business community, spares a few good words, it can work as a catalyst to the state government?s initiatives,? summed up the industrialist.

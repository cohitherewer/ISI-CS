 Minister on run resigns, CM smiles

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Oct. 31: Fugitive minister Narayan Biswas quit office today, a week before the high court hears his anticipatory bail plea in connection with a case in which he has evaded arrest for 16 years.

 ?He (Biswas) has tendered his resignation and I have sent it to the governor,? said Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, whose government and party had been under increasing pressure for ?shielding? Biswas.

 Asked about his reaction to the resignation of the minister of state for cottage and small-scale industries, the chief minister said: ?No comment, you write what you wish.? The hint of a smile, however, was suggestive.

 The Telegraph was first to predict today?s development and report how Bhattacharjee, unhappy over growing public outrage towards Biswas, was pressing for the resignation and arrest in compliance with a court order.

 Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen will look after Biswas?s department.

 ?The government should hasten his arrest,? said Biplab Mitra, the Trinamul Congress?s South Dinajpur president who had been pursuing the case against the CPM leader. 

 Biswas said he was ?ready to surrender?.

 The CPM brass decided to direct Biswas to quit on Saturday. Before finalising the decision, they obtained legal opinion and consulted senior leaders and housing minister Gautam Deb, who oversees party affairs on Biswas?s home turf, South Dinajpur. Deb had conveyed the district unit?s no-need-for-resignation-now mood. 

 Anil Biswas, to whom Biswas is said to be close, and some other leaders were also apparently in favour of waiting till November 7 when the court reconvenes after Puja vaca-tion and takes up the bail plea. 

 They relented in the face of Bhattacharjee?s argument that the party had to effectively fight back the Opposition?s campaign demanding the arrest, launched with an eye on next year?s Assembly polls.

 The resignation also enables the party to counter the Election Commission?s observation that the government was not making any attempt to execute arrest warrants against 70,000 people, including Biswas who, according to police, was absconding. 

 Never before in the Left Front?s 29 years in power has a CPM minister had to resign for his alleged involvement in criminal cases ? arson, rioting and attempted murder at Ratanpur in South Dinajpur.

 ?Although the charges ag-ainst him have not been proved, by getting him to resign, we have set an example of political morality,? Biswas said. 

 A court of erstwhile West Dinajpur issued a warrant against Biswas, then an influential leader, in 1989. In 16 years, police could not touch him. He did not have to appear in court once. After relinquishing office, he said: ?I have done what my party had asked me to do. I will go by the party?s instructions in future as well.?

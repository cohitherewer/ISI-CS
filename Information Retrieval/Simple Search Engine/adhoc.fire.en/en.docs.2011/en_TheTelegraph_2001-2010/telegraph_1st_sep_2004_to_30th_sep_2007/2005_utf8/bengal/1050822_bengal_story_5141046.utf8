 Debt leads to family death

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 21: A financial 

 crunch, coupled with humiliation by in-laws, allegedly led 

 a resident of South 24-Parganas to poison his three minor 

 sons before killing himself this morning.

 Dharmendra Prasad Barma, 30, poisoned his three sons, Kisan (6), Balaram (3) and Anthony (4) at his residence and then strangulated them to make sure that they are dead. Barma then hanged himself from the ceiling of their house at Phultala near Maheshtala on the citys southern fringes.

 Barmas 70-year-old mother, Santi Devi, discovered the tragedy when she came to wake her son up at 10 am.

 Preliminary investigation reveals that a financial crisis might have driven the man to take this step, S.N. Gupta, the South 24-Parganas superintendent of police, said this afternoon.

 Barmas wife Munni, 28, had gone to her parents house ? at Fatepur under Garden Reach police station ? with her son Bharat, 2, on Friday to celebrate Rakhi.

 Munni did not return yesterday and her husband went to his in-laws house around 5 am today to bring her back.

 But he was manhandled by his father-in-law and two brothers-in-law, who refused to send his wife back, said Santi Devi.

 Santi Devi said she knocked at the door of the room where her son and grandchildren were sleeping around 6.30 am.

 As there was no response, I went to the tea stall but came back around 10. This time I found the door open. Inside, I saw to my horror my three grandsons scattered on the floor and Dharmendra hanging from the ceiling, she said.

 Barmas father-in-law, Chandra Prasad, denied having thrashed him. Dharmendra came to our house this morning but no one manhandled him, he said.

 Calcutta, Sept. 8: The shadow of a personal poll setback in her Calcutta South Lok Sabha constituency looming, Mamata Banerjee today forced yet another abandonment of the Delimitation Commissions public hearing.

 The commission announced the cancellation of todays hearing within five minutes of its commencement, after Mamatas supporters in Mahajati Sadan began to hurl missiles ? bottles and other objects ? at commission members and officials seated on the dais.

 We (the commission) express deep anguish at these unfortunate incidents? further course of action on the delimitation exercise for Bengal will be deliberated upon?. said Shangara Ram, its secretary.

 The so-called public hearings are a farce, said Mamata. We are going to press for transparent sittings in districts where people want to speak out against the killing of democracy in Bengal.

 In the past four days, Mamata has disrupted two other public hearings of the commission ? created by the earlier NDA government in Delhi to recast constituencies on the basis of the 2001 census ? in Siliguri and Durgapur. The Trinamul Congress is still an NDA partner.

 But observers said Mamatas concern stems from the fear that she might end up on a weak wicket with several segments known to be her strongholds lopped off from her constituency. In their place, areas known to be pro-CPM might be added to Calcutta South, making the 2006 Assembly polls tricky for the Trinamul chief. 

 The CPM candidate had shaved off her victory margin by 127,000 votes in the last general elections.

 She is fast losing ground, even in Calcutta. Results of the Lok Sabha elections in May 2004 and the Calcutta Municipal Corporation election this May prove this. And she knows what lies in store, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas said.

 Trinamul got only one seat from Bengal in the last Lok Sabha elections ? Calcutta South ? and lost the city civic body to the CPM this year.

 Trinamul had fared well in the 2001 Assembly elections bagging 13 of the 24 seats in the city. The Congress tallied two and the CPM and its allies 9. In North 24-Parganas, Trinamul won 12 of the 25 seats, three more than the CPM. 

 Mamata is now believed to be alarmed at reports that seats in Calcutta and North 24-Parganas, where her party had fared well, will decrease because of the restructuring. 

 The Congress, which did not play any role in the cancellation of the sittings on Monday and Wednesday, joined Trinamul supporters today.

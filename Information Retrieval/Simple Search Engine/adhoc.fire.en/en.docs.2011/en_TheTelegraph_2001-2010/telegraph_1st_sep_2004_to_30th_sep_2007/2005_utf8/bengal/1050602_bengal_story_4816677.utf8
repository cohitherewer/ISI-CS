 Drive to rescue lost Digha

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Sunrise at Digha: Once beautiful

 Midnapore, June 1: A few thousand shops and establishments are being bulldozed to ease congestion in beach town Digha, much maligned but still a favourite for many looking to steal a getaway.

 The Digha-Shankarpur Development Authority launched the clean-up mission last evening in a desperate bid to restore some of the lost glory to the pristine coast that made Digha, about 200 km from Calcutta, a hot spot.

 In the face of eviction, the encroachers tried to force tourists out of the town and close down hotels. A hotel owner, allegedly attacked by them, had to be hospitalised.

 S. Mitra, the chief executive officer of the authority, said the beach town had about 3,500 illegal shops, eateries and other establishments. Yesterday, we demolished about 500 structures. We will clean up the rest in the next few days.

 Mitra echoed the complaints of many tourists, disgusted with the dirty seaside. The encroachers soil the beach and other tourist spots with garbage and plastic. Some of them have settled down in their shanties and started rearing livestock.

 Every year, about 25 lakh tourists flock to the town, one of Calcuttas nearest getaways. Earlier, it took over five hours to reach the sea by car but the new train service has brought Digha closer by about an hour-and-a-half. With industry flourishing in nearby Haldia, tourism should look up even further. 

 Mitra sounded hopeful. Digha will soon look much better. We will plant more trees and add more green, he said.

 Hotel owners said foreign tourists had started avoiding Digha because of pollution and congestion. The encroachers were mostly responsible for nearly ruining a beautiful beach. The administration should ensure that the place is clean through the year, said Girish Chandra Raut, the secretary of the Digha Hoteliers Association.

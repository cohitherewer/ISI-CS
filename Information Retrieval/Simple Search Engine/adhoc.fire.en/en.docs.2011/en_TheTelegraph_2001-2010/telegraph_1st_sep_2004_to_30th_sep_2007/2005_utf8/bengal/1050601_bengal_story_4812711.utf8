 Winners, grocers son or teachers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bankura, May 31: Numbers 1, 2 and 3 all went to Bankura in this years victory stand. 

 For topper Arindam Santra, it came as a surprise.

 But little time did he have to soak in the pleasant feeling. By 1 pm, he was flooded with phone calls, including some from VIPs. State CPM secretary Anil Biswas called up around noon to congratulate Arindam. Tribal welfare minister Upen Kisku, a local legislator, was next. 

 A resident of Sonamukhi, 225 km from Calcutta, he was confident of doing well. But never in my dreams I thought I would emerge on top with 785, he said. 

 Neighbours and friends flocked to his house and his parents greeted everyone with sandesh and rosogolla. 

 We dont want to force our son into any particular stream, said father Balaipada, an electronics lecturer at Sainthia Abhedananda College in Birbhum. 

 The parents attributed their sons success to hard work. He studied eight to nine hours and took tuition in English and mathematics. He was never tensed and played cricket and watched TV, said mother Sikha, a philosophy teacher at Arindams Sonamukhi Bindubasini Jubilee High School.

 Ahana Pradhan of Bankura Mission Girls School in the district town scored 783 to come a close second this year. She is first among girls. 

 Her father, a doctor at the Bankura Sammilani Medical College and Hospital, too, did not want to force her into a stream of his choice.

 Rajen Madan of Ramharipur Ramakrishna Mission High School, Gangajalghati, about 240 km from Calcutta, came third with 782. Son of a grocer, he has made his father proud. All credit goes to the monks, said Lalmohan.

 Rajen aspires to be a teacher, said Swami Kritwibasananda, the principal of his school.

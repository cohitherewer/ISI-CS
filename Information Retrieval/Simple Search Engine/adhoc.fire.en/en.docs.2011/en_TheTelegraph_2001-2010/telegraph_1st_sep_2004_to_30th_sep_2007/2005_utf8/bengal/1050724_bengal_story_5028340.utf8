 Science communication course, on way

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 23: A course to train people to spread the good word of science, complete with an international faculty and a world-class experience, is making its way into the city.

 The National Council of Science Museums (NCSM), in association with the Birla Institute of Science and Technology (BITS), Pilani, launched a masters course in science communication today at its headquarters in Salt Lake. 

 Ingit Mukherjee, the director-general of NCSM, said the course ? the only one its kind in South and Southeast Asia ? aims to spread the word of science among common people, be they in museums or corporate houses.

 The course content includes theoretical, technical and practical training ? from science communication to museum management and operations, history of science and technology and learning science in non-formal settings. 

 Theres a bit of everything, like IT applications in science communications, feature writing and even filming, Mukherjee said.

 Classes for the first batch of 15 students in the two-year course will begin on Monday in a new six-storey building constructed by the NCSM in Sector Vs GN block. The building will also house a library, laboratory, canteen and a hostel.

 The teaching staff will be drawn from BITS, Pilani and NCSM. Every term will have two lecturers visiting from the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC. There will be four terms in a year.

 Guest lecturers will include faculty from IIM Calcutta, IIT Mumbai, NID Ahmedabad, Jadavpur University and Prof Robert Friedel from the University of Maryland in the US.

 Initially, we have students being sponsored by institutions where they work. But we are also offering five fellowships to new students. The numbers may increase, depending on the demand. There have been a lot of queries from universities, science institutions and museums ? from India and abroad ? because this is the only course of its kind in the South and Southeast Asia region, Mukherjee said. 

 We used to have a similar course in BITS, Pilani, but the graduates left to work for software companies during the dotcom boom. So we discontinued it. But Im happy that we can do this again, added Prof. L.K. Maheshwari, the director of BITS, Pilani.

 The cost of the project is within our budget allocation. From next year, we expect the running cost to be around Rs 10 lakh, said Mukherjee. The students will be a charged Rs 15,000 per term along with an admission fee of Rs 10,000. 

 The fourth and final semester has been reserved for dissertation, while the rest of the course has been spilt into 22-week semesters. They will have seminars, tutorials and interactions. 

 The post-graduate degree will be conferred by BITS, Pilani. 

 To be eligible for the course, one should either have a bachelors degree in engineering or technology or an M.Sc.

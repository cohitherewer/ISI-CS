 Rebels strike, police chase

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Purulia/Krishnagar, Oct. 4: Maoist guerrillas blew up an under-construction police camp in Purulias Bandwan early this morning even as reports of the security establishment having upped its drive to weed out the rebels came in from distant Nadia. 

 Although no one was injured, the Maoists dealt yet another blow to the police with the Purulia blast.

 About 150 suspected CPI (Maoist) activists dressed in military fatigues told residents of Gurupana village in the Bandwan forest, about 280 km from Calcutta, to accompany them to the police camp that was being constructed nearby. 

 The police said the guerrillas asked the villagers to demolish the brick-and-concrete structure. The rebels planted explosives in the partly-demolished structure and blew it up. They left behind a stack of posters and Maoist literature.

 The man contracted to build the camp, Mohammad Shahidullah, was threatened with dire consequences if he continued with the work.

 The officer-in-charge of Bandwan police station, Nilmadhab Das, was killed and five policemen injured when a landmine planted by the extremists exploded in the Kantabora forest on October 11, 2003. 

 Purulia superintendent of police R. Shivkumar said: The Maoists tried to stop the construction of the camp as it is being set up at a strategic location, bordering Purulia, West Midnapore and Jharkhand, which they use as a corridor.

 He went to Gurupana with a large force and cordoned off the blast site. Experts are being brought in from West Midnapore to look for landmines in the area as some villagers apprehended their presence.

 In a series of raids over the past 48 hours, 29 suspected CPI (Maoist) activists have been arrested in Nadia. The swoop apparently followed the interrogation of Chandi Sarkar, a top CPI (Maoist) leader who was arrested on September 23 from a hideout in Chapra in Nadia, 130 km from Calcutta. 

 The police said Sarkar was a state committee member of the CPI (Maoist), who led the party in Birbhum, Burdwan, Nadia and Murshidabad. 

 District police chief R. Rajsekharan said among those held was Mantu Chatterjee, a Naxalite of the 1970s who heads Maoist operations in Nadia.

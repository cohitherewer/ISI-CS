 Big cat scare sparks fury

 A STAFF REPORTER

 A fishing cat, not a leopard

 Calcutta, Dec. 5: Villagers, who mistook a fishing cat for a leopard, assaulted forest department officials and tried to force them into a pond in search of it at a village in Hooghly.

 The officials had gone to Jamaibati village in Haripal, about 70 km from Calcutta, to net a fishing cat that mauled two villagers yesterday morning. 

 The animal, spotted in a bush, had attacked Sheikh Mafiz and Sanatan Hata. When Mafiz raised a hue and cry, it mauled him. Hata was attacked after he hit it with a bamboo stick. 

 The injured animal had then jumped into a pond full of hyacinth and nobody saw it thereafter. 

 Sources in the forest department said the cat had probably died. Some of the villagers used spears aimlessly last night to pierce the cover of hyacinth in the pond in a bid to locate the animal, said Subrata Palchowdhury, the technical assistant of the wildlife wing. 

 Forest officials used searchlights throughout last night to trace the animal.

 Trouble again started this morning when some villagers from neighbouring Tarakeswar, who gathered after the news spread, tried to force the forest officials, led by Palchowdhury, to get into the pond in search of the animal.

 The villagers abused us. I was assaulted along with one of our forest guards, Ram Chakraborty. The villagers refused to believe that the animal was not a leopard, but a mere cat. They also refused to believe that it might have escaped. They went on persuading us to get into the pond, said Palchowdhury, who was almost pushed into it. 

 V.K. Jadav, the conservator of forests, wildlife wing, said: Deputy ranger Kanak Mandal was also assaulted yesterday when he refused to get into the pond.

 Chandernagore subdivisional police officer Sujoy Chanda said the pond will be cleared tomorrow with the help of the local people.

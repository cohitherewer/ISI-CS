 Poll panel vigil on

 Calcutta, Dec. 9: The Election Commission, which has its eyes trained on poll-bound Bengal, is sending five teams of observers on Sunday to oversee the revision of electoral rolls.

 Each team will be headed by an official of the rank of commission secretary. They will check whether disposal of applications for revision of the rolls is being carried out according to rules, chief electoral officer Debashish Sen said. The scanner will be mainly on constituencies along the Bangladesh border. 

 North 24-Parganas, Murshidabad and Jalpaiguri officials have been asked to ascertain the citizenship of those who want their names included in the rolls, an official said. Sens office will shift from Writers Buildings to Camac Street by next month.

 Beware, headless schools

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 25: The government today threatened to stop financial assistance to schools if their managing committees delayed filling up headmaster and headmistress posts. 

 School education minister Kanti Biswas said in the Assembly that the posts of institution heads were vacant in over 900 schools across the state. 

 These schools are now being run by teachers-in-charge. The minister said: We do not encourage schools without heads as their academic activities suffer. 

 In most schools, the vacancies could not apparently be filled up because the managing committees did not send their applications to the district inspectors of school despite several reminders. An application from the committees is a must before the government starts the process of recruiting a new headmaster or headmistress in a state-aided institution, Biswas said.

 The government, the minister added, has observed that the senior teacher who performs the schools heads duties in his or her absence often does not want to get the post filled up. In most cases, these teachers lack the qualification to make it to the post officially and do not submit their own resume. 

 Biswas accused the managing committees of failing to act against teachers assuming the headmaster or headmistresss role.

 A candidate should have a Masters degree and at least 10 years teaching experience to apply for a school heads post. 

 The School Service Commission recruits heads for the 11,000-odd state-aided secondary and higher secondary institutions. But a panel of candidates to fill up the vacant posts is prepared only on the basis of applications from the managing committees.

 The Congresss Abdul Mannan pointed out that in many schools senior teachers perform the duties of the head without the pay that should come with the post. But the minister ruled out introducing a system of paying an additional allowance to the teachers-in-charge. 

 The School Service Commission will soon announce tests for recruiting heads of schools that have already submitted their applications.

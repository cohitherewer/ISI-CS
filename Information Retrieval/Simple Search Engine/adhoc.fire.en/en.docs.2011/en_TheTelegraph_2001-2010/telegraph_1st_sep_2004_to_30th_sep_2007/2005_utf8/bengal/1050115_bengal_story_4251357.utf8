 Summit?s ?real? hero in Bengal CM

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 13: And the winner is?

 As the curtain dropped on Partnership Summit 2005 today, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was named the ?real hero?.

 ?Now, it is time to thank the real hero of this meet, the West Bengal chief minister,? says Y.C. Deveshwar, the ITC chairman who is vice-president of the Confederation of Indian Industry that organised the event.

 It may just be a way of thanking the chief minister for turning up for a session he was not supposed to attend, but it may also be that from Indian business? forgotten child, Bengal under Bhattacharjee has travelled at least to the position of Maharashtra?s poor cousin.

 ?I was not supposed to come to the valedictory session, but when the organisers requested me I could not say no to them. I think now I should become a member of CII,? said Bhattacharjee to a round of hearty applause.

 Whether or not that can be interpreted as an invitation to join CII is debatable, but the chief minister played the role of the gracious host as spotlessly as the white of his dhuti-panjabi.

 Hold next year?s summit, too, in Calcutta, he requested CII.

 Sunil Kant Munjal, CII president, said: ?The government is proactive and takes note of our suggestions. Earlier, Hyderabad has hosted the partnership summit in two consecutive years and it can happen for Calcutta as well.?

 That would have been under . Chandrababu Naidu, another favourite of businessmen. He lost the elections, remember?

 There?s little chance of that happening to Bhattacharjee, but he may not like the parallel for different reasons. Though, much like Naidu, he?s banging away at infotech keys, it?s the legacy of farmers? suicides he wouldn?t want to carry.

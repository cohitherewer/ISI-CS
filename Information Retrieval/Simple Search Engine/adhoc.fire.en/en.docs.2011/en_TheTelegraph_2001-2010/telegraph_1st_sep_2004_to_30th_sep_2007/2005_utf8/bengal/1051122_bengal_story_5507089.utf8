 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, Nov. 21: Burglars cleaned up electrical equipment from a powerhouse on the Nadia collectorate campus last night, leaving the premises powerless today.

 Work in the collectorate almost came to a halt with the district magistrate and his three deputies, among about 1,200 officers, sitting in the dark. Generators could not be run as the thieves also stole the metal bars connecting their wires to the powerhouse. After much pleading from DM Rajesh Pandey, employees of 20 departments in two four-storey buildings sat down to work. 

 Barasat: Sajit Mondal, 22, and his sister Radhika, 12, committed suicide on Monday at Halisahar in North 24-Parganas, about 50 km from Calcutta. Police said they consumed pesticide after their mother married a second time.

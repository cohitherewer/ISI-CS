 Gift packet clue to widow murder

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 11: Police today stumbled on a possible lead on the murder of a widow in her Bishop Lefroy Road apartment.

 A gift packet, addressed to Mr Sundaram, was found in the room where 71-year-old Laxmi Sundarams body was found on Thursday. 

 The packet, which contained only some newspaper pages, had the police sniffing a clue. They have sought help from handwriting experts.

 One thing is clear ? whoever brought it along was obviously trying to fool someone, possibly Laxmi Sundaram, said an official of the detective departments homicide wing. 

 The packet and the tag are fresh. So why would anyone want to send something for a gentleman who passed away five years ago?

 Handwriting experts today collected samples from the five persons who were detained yesterday and contacted the Sundarams friends and relatives. We will collect the samples of their handwriting. We have initiated the move because it is confirmed that the assailants were known to the deceased, the officer said.

 Laxmi Sundaram, who used to stay alone in the flat, was found murdered around 6 pm on Thursday. Both her hands and legs were tied and she was gagged to death. 

 A medical examination of the body during post-mortem confirmed that the death took place between 2 pm and 6 pm.

 The police, however, said the buildings gatekeeper and two liftmen had told them that they had not seen anyone enter the building carrying a gift packet. 

 Fingerprint experts were also pressed into service today to collect samples from the two glasses found on the dining table with half-finished soft drinks. 

 They will also go through the list of the friends of the deceased and relatives which was handed over to us by her younger son Rajkumar Sundaram, said another officer working on this case. 

 The two glasses will play a key role in our investigation. It appears that the victim treated the assailants to the drinks minutes before she was gagged to death, he added.

 Laxmi Sundarams daughter Vaijayanthibala arrived from Mumbai today. When she went to her mothers 3,000-square foot flat, she found Rs 45,000 and some US dollars kept under clothes in one of the three almirahs. But no jewellery was found, said the officer.

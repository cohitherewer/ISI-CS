 Residents? no to strikes 

 VIVEK CHHETRI

 Darjeeling, March 11: Whispers against the string of strikes threatened by the GNLF is growing louder here. 

 About 70 residents, from businessmen to tea plantation workers and school heads, braved veiled GNLF threats and attended a meeting to speak their minds.

 Nooren Dunne, a lecturer of St Jospeh?s College, said the citizens should question their leaders. ?We have to meet Ghisingh. It is our right to know,? he said.

 Saurav Gurung, who works in a tea garden, said: ?Despite problems, tea workers eke out a living. Will the strikers give us food? My house was damaged during the Gorkhaland agitation. I?m still a GNLF supporter, but we must ask if strikes are a solution.?

 Father Kinley Tshering, who represented the schools here, said: ?As it is, we find it difficult to complete the syllabi. The ICSE and ISC exams are on... We get the question papers from banks. What if they are closed??

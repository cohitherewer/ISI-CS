 CM on trade trip

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 10: Opening the locks of closed units coupled with setting up green field projects will be top on the mind of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee when he visits Singapore and Indonesia later this month.

 Along with state industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen and special secretary S.A. Ahmed, a 15-member team of industrialists will be part of the chief ministers entourage. 

 He will leave for Singapore on August 22 and be back in the city on August 26 after spending a day Jakarta. During Bhattacharjees absence, labour minister Mohammed Amin will officiate as chief minister. 

 I am hopeful of potential foreign investment for the states industrialisation, Bhattacharjee told reporters at Writers Buildings today.

 Revival of closed units like Dunlop, Titagarh Paper Mill and Bengal Paper Mill will be on the agenda of the chief ministers marathon interaction with investors. 

 The setting up of a special economic zone in the Sonarpur-Baruipur belt of South 24-Parganas by the Indonesia-based Salim group, a manufacturing unit of two-wheelers in the Howrah-Ulberia area and a coal mixing plant at Haldia port will also be discussed.

 Officials said investors from both Singapore and Indonesia have shown interest in setting up logistic hubs at Kona and in the Dankuni industrial town.

 Bhattacharjee said he would meet Singapore Prime Minister Lee K. Lung and representatives from the Indo-Singapore Merchant Chamber of Commerce to discuss investments in Bengal. 

 He will also deliver a lecture at the Institute of South Asian Studies and have a session with the countrys top industrialists before meeting officials from the financial company Temasek Holdings and representatives of the Bengal Association.

 Salim recce for mobike factory

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 23: A team of engineers from Indonesias Salim Group will be in town on Monday to finalise the groundwork for the two-wheeler plant at Uluberia.

 The experts will also inspect the site for the upcoming township in west Howrah, being built by Salim along with the Ciputra Group.

 Beni Santoso, who heads the Salim Group, is scheduled to visit Calcutta on his way back from Russia in the third week of October and review the progress of both the motorcycle and township projects. He will also finalise with the chief minister the location where the proposed special economic zone will come up.

 The Indonesian conglomerate is collaborating with a Chinese company, Quinchin, for the two-wheeler unit. The Uluberia unit is likely to provide jobs to 3,000 people. 

 In west Howrah, the group is investing $350 million in the Calcutta West International City. The township, spread across 400 acres, will house around 6,800 residential buildings, a commercial complex and other facilities like health centres and entertainment zones.

 The Salim Group is aware of the controversy over the acquisition of land for its projects in South 24-Parganas, NRI businessman Prasoon Mukherjee said toady. He added: The group will be paying for the land it takes over. What if it does not invest in Bengal? Whose purpose will that serve?

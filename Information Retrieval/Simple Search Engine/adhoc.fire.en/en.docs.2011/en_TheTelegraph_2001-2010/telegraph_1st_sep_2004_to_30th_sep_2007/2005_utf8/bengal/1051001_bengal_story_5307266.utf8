 Kalchini (Alipurduar) Sept. 30: It was a robbery, but un- like any other ? because an entire building, from its furniture to its bricks and tiles, were stolen.

 From a sprawling British-period structure, European Club here was reduced to a stretch of barren land in a little over a week. 

 Part of the Kalchini tea estate, 34 km from here, the club (called European because it was once frequented by the sahibs) had badminton and tennis courts, billiard and table tennis boards, timber furniture and a bar where wine glasses tinkled five-six years ago. 

 With the sinking fortunes of the tea estates dotting the region, the number of babus dwindled and the club lost its patronage. 

 The building withstood the turmoil, until September 16. Saroj Chakraborty, the man in charge of the it, said: That day, a large mob that had assembled in front of the clubhouse started tearing it apart. I did not venture out or protest. I was scared. I informed the authorities ? the secretary of the club and the Dooars branch of the Indian Tea Association. The secretary called police.

 Alipurduar subdivisional officer Saumitra Mohan pleaded ignorance about the pulldown. But he remembered that tourism minister Dinesh Dakua had declared that the club would be promoted as a tourist destination.

 Pradeep Sarkar, the officer-in-charge of the Kalchini police station, said no formal complaint had been lodged. So, no action can be taken. Another problem is that a large number of people was involved. Initiating action against a mob isnt easy, particularly when workers here are going through a crisis.

 The police suspect that jobless workers of the estate, struggling to stay alive, carried out the demolition. 

 Manufacturing work at the garden stopped long ago. Plucking is on, but for the past month or so the workers have not been getting their rations and electricity supply has been snapped. 

 Sirajul Ansari, who lives in the labour lines and works as a mason, said the workers took possession of all that the club had. 

 I have taken only the bri-cks, he said, insisting that he could not be counted among the estates workers. 

 I have not been getting my salary for six months. When I heard about the tea tourism drive, I thought all would be well again, Chakraborty said. The Clubbabu, as he is known locally, does not know what the future has in store for him. 

 European Club was set up in 1918 by 13 tea gardens of the Dooars. Subscriptions from the then thriving estates were used for staff salary and the clubs maintenance.

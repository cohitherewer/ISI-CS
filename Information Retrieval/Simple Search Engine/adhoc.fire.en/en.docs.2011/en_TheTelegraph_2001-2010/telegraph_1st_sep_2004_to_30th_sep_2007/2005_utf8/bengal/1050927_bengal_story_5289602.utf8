 The ministers of finance, public health engineering, fisheries, irrigation, Sunderbans affairs and relief departments comprise the panel. Finance minister Asim Dasgupta met senior officials today to prepare for the next high tide, expected around October 2 or 3. The last spell of high tide in the Bay of Bengal had killed eight people and resulted in loss of Rs 300 crore. The committee would focus on embankment repairs and reclamation of river basins. 

 Calcutta: A provident fund scheme for domestic helps is now being considered by Writers Buildings. The suggestion came up during discussions Sushanta Ghosh, the minister for labour, employment exchange and employees state insurance, held with officials.

 Asansol: The CPM has alleged that observers appointed by the Election Commission for the Asansol Lok Sabha bypoll are biased against it. They are only videographing our campaign rallies, said the secretary of the partys Burdwan unit, Amal Halder.

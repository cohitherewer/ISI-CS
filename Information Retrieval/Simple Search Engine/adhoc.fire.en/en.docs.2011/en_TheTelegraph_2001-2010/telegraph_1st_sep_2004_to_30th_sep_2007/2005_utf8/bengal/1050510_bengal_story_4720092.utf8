 Left ally demands Gorkhaland

 VIVEK CHHETRI

 Darjeeling, May 9: The Peoples Democratic Front (PDF), an alliance of parties opposed to Subash Ghisingh, submitted a memorandum to Left Front chairman Biman Bose when he came here for the May Day rally, seeking support for a separate Gorkhaland state.

 The memorandum caught Bose and his men off-guard, said a CPM insider who was present at the May 1 meeting at the Tourist Lodge here.

 When the PDF leaders confronted Bose about the Left Front governments stand on Ghisingh, he apparently said Writers Buildings had ?certain obligations?. The PDF leaders then spoke of their ?obligation to the hill people, whose aspiration had always been a separate state?. 

 An apparently uncomfortable Bose reportedly said he would take up the matter with party leaders in Calcutta. 

 The content of the memorandum was kept under wraps as it could ?embarrass? the CPM and the CPI. The Left Front has always been opposed to the idea of a divided Bengal, the reason why it had initially refused to join the PDF when it was floated last year. 

 In Calcutta, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas said: ?We are ready to extend all cooperation to the hill people, but the demand for a separate state is not acceptable.?

 ?The statehood cry was unexpected as the combine had more or less decided to stick to the save democracy plank in the run-up to the polls,? said a political observer of the hills.

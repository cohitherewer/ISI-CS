 Kidnap heat in rural poll 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, Aug. 12: Four Congress leaders were arrested today on charges of kidnapping two women members of a CPM-led panchayat samiti in Murshidabad.

 Asrafan Bibi and Manwara Bibi, CPM members of the Beldanga-II panchayat samiti, went missing after the 13-member Congress Opposition moved a no-confidence motion against the chief of the 15-member CPM board last Tuesday. 

 The Congress leaders allegedly abducted the duo and kept them in hiding ahead of August 16, the date decided by the block development officer for voting on the motion.

 One of those held is the Congress general secretary of the Behrampore subdivision. The others are functionaries of the block unit. 

 They were picked up from their homes at Shaktipur, Rejinagar and Milki, about 180 km from Calcutta. 

 Asrafans husband Rashid Sheikh had lodged a police complaint after she disappeared. The panchayat samiti chief, Alaka Brahmmachari, said that Asrafan and Manwara, who is in charge of food in her council, were kidnapped on Tuesday morning when they were on their way to the BDOs office. The Congress leaders and anti-socials backed by them are trying to wrest the board by kidnapping our members, she alleged.

 District superintendent of police Niraj Kumar Singh said: Rashid Sheikh has alleged that his wife and the other woman were kidnapped and kept confined in a secret place. We are trying to arrest all those named in his complaint.

 The Congress claimed that the women had joined the party and were in safe custody. 

 With the help of these two votes, we will displace the CPM from power. Asrafans husband knows very well where his wife is. CPM leaders have forced him to lodge the police complaint. Asrafan has joined us with Rashid Sheikhs permission. We have told the district magistrate that we will produce the two women in perfect health before him, said district Congress leader and zilla parishad member Sanwar Sheikh.

 District magistrate, N. Manjunatha Prasad said that the police would probe the kidnap charge. 

 As it is a kidnapping case, the police will carry out a full inquiry. On August 16, I will send a senior officer to conduct the vote on the no-confidence motion.

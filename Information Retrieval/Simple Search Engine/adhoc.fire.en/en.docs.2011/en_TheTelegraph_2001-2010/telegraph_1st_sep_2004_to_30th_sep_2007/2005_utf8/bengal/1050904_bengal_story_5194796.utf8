 Local hand in hotel killing

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Sept. 3: One of the assassins of Lalita Devi, 28, the woman found dead in a hotel room yesterday afternoon, might have been a local hand known to her professed husband Ranthir Kumar. 

 The employees of Hotel Atlantic were called to the police headquarters in Lalbazar today and asked to help in making portraits of the suspected killers. Hours after an attempt to trace the womans whereabouts in Gaya proved futile, sleuths revisited the hotel on the first floor of Futnani Chambers ? off the Calcutta Municipal Corporation headquarters ? and learnt that a third man had walked in wearing slippers. Unlike Ranthir, he was medium-built and had a moustache. On September 1, he came around 7.35 pm and didnt ask for either Ranthir or Lalita Devi. He just wanted to know the way to the room and walked in, said Mohammad Mukhtar, one of the two full-time hotel staff members.

 A senior detective department officer said: The murder was done to perfection.... They left behind no vital clue.

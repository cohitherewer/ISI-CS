 Fatwa for picking up ration

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 East Midnapore, Aug. 19: A group of Muslims in an East Midnapore village has prevented a woman and her children from leaving home for work or to attend school.

 Nargis Bibi, 35, of Udalkhali village about 200 km from Calcutta, was even asked by the 150-strong Muslim community of the area to pay a fine of Rs 20,000 by August 15 for leaving her home to do chores not usually done by women of her community.

 Nargiss husband, Sheikh Jehangir, has been undergoing treatment for neurological disorders at the West Bank hospital in Calcutta. Her father-in-law, Juwed Ali, a former block development office employee, also keeps unwell. Thus, Nargis had to do the chores, such as picking up the ration.

 Fellow villagers said this is not acceptable to the Muslim community and imposed the fatwa. Nargis refused to pay the fine and has been confined since August 15.

 Yesterday, Nargiss husband lodged a complaint at the Hedia police post.

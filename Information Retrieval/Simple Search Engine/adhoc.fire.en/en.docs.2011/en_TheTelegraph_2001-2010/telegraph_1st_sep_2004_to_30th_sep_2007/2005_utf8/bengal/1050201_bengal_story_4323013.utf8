 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Jan. 31: The CPM brass today said the government?s pro-industry line springs from a party policy that encapsulates popular aspirations.

 On the last day of the party?s state committee meeting at Alimuddin Street, state secretary Anil Biswas, Left Front chairman Biman Bose, ministers Nirupam Sen and Surjya Kanta Misra and Citu president Shyamal Chakraborty said the pro-industry line was ?reflective? of pro-people policies. The praise was designed to blunt criticism of the government for its industry friendliness at district party meets, where Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was accused of being more concerned about the affluent in the city. ?We need capital and industry to end unemployment and develop Bengal,? a leader said today.

 Asansol: The CPM-controlled municipal corporation here will tax water from April 1. Mayor Tapas Roy said the levy will fetch over Rs 50 lakh a year. 

 Calcutta: Kamarhati Jute Mills labourers forced the factory shut on Monday to protest against the arrest of co-worker Akbar Manowara. He was held on Sunday for allegedly assaulting two mill officers.

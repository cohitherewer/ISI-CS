 Uncle turns rapist 

 Barasat, Oct. 14: A Class VI girl was raped by a neighbour in his 30s whom she called uncle at Ashokenagar in North 24-Parganas on Wednesday. 

 Residents of the locality, attracted by the girls cries of pain, rescued her but Harasit Mondal had fled by then. Her father, Niranjan Bairagi, lodged the complaint with police today, after she complained of pain in the abdomen. 

 Police said a preliminary probe had proved rape.

 The girl, 12, had wanted money from her father, a grocer, to go pandal hopping with friends. Niranjan said he could not give her anything as Harasit owed him Rs 500. He asked her to take Rs 20 from Harasit, said Praveen Kumar, the North 24-Parganas superintendent of police.

 When the girl went next door, Harasit, 35, was alone. His wife and son had gone out for the Puja. He paid her Rs 20 and said he wanted to escort her to the nearest pandal. Harasit took the girl out, covered her face and dragged her to a clump of shrubs behind his house, said Kumar.

 In-laws in judicial custody 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Suri, July 20: A day after being charged with trying to rape his daughter-in-law for dowry, Nemai Das Bairagya was remanded in judicial custody till August 2.

 Shiuli Das Bairagya, a housewife in Birbhum, escaped from her 48-year-old father-in-laws clutches when he tried to rape her last week.

 Nemai and his wife Sarati were today produced in the court of Birbhums chief judicial magistrate at Suri, around 230 km from Calcutta. No bail petition was moved on their behalf. 

 We could not arrange for a lawyer as we were arrested late last night, Nemai said.

 Police picked up the couple yesterday after Shiuli lodged a complaint. Shiulis husband Prasanta, sister-in-law Latika and her husband Kartick Das are absconding. 

 She has also written to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee seeking justice.

 Nemai today said he was paid Rs 11,000 as dowry and not Rs 1 lakh as Shiuli and her father Sakharam Das had claimed.

 Nemai added that he had attended the wedding at Sakharams house with 63 guests last year.

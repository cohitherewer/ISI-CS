 Mobile courts 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Krishnagar, Feb. 24: The Nadia administration today set up mobile courts in 17 blocks during a drive to recover loans amounting to Rs 20 crore disbursed to farmers, owners of small-scale industries and traders. 

 Some of the loans, given by five public sector banks and non-banking financial institutions including the Life Insurance Corporation and General Insurance Corporation, have been lying unpaid for 10 years. 

 Additional district magistrate B.B. Biswas said about 10,000 people had been identified as ?defaulters? and ?if we fail to motivate these people to clear their loans, it will be difficult for them to get fresh loans?. Ten deputy magistrates, four additional district magistrates and four sub-divisional officers (SDOs) have been assigned to recover the loans, Biswas added.

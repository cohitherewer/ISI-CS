 Purse full with promise

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 11: The claim is tall, but there is little to back it at the ground level.

 The government has been saying that it will meet its 2007 deadline for completing work on the Dunlop interchange at the PWD Road-BT Road crossing. But PWD minister Amar Chowdhury today said his department has yet to get a paisa for the Rs 60-crore project. 

 The financing is uncertain. We do not know when we are going to get the money, he said.

 The interchange is key to the under-construction Second Vivekananda Bridge because traffic from its western flank will need it for smooth passage towards Barrackpore and Shyambazar.

 Officials connected with the project said it would take at least two years to complete the interchange and with funds still uncertain, a delay is inevitable. 

 Although private firms are building the bridge, according to their agreement with the government, the PWD has to construct the interchange at Dunlop.

 Were seeking 35 per cent of the project cost from the Centre under the National Urban Renewal Mission. The proposal has already been forwarded to Delhi by the urban development department. The state government will have to make budgetary allocation for 15 per cent, while the remaining 50 per cent will come from financial institutions, which will be the states liability Chow-dhury said. 

 The PWD minister has had preliminary discussions on the issue with finance minister Asim Dasgupta, but nothing has come of them yet.

 Consulting Engineering Services, which is leading the consortium building the bridge, has expressed apprehensions over the fact that no progress has been made in work on the approach roads, especially the Dunlop interchange, and that the governments delay could hold up the entire project. 

 Chowdhury admitted that there was such a possibility.

 Unless traffic flows smoothly on the approach roads, not many will want to use the bridge and, therefore, the toll collection will be poor. After getting the funds, we hope to complete the interchange in 18 months. By then, work on the bridge will also be over, Chowdhury said.

 Chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb, however, claimed that the project ? both construction of the bridge and the approach roads ? was running on schedule. I have recently reviewed the progress. There is no delay. The work will finish within 2007.

 PWD secretary Kalyani Chowdhury said: It is a complex project. Once we start work, BT Road will be paralysed. We have to draw up a plan very carefully.

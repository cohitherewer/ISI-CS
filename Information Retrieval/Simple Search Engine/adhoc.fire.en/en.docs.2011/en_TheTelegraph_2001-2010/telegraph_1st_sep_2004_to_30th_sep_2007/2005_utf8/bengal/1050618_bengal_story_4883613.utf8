 Border vigil with BDR

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Doors closed: A BSF guard on the Bangladesh border

 Krishnagar, June 17: The BSF is expected to begin joint patrolling with Bangladesh Rifles in Nadia next month to check crime along the border, infiltration and build bridges.

 The proposal to work together was discussed at a meeting between the BSF director-general and his counterpart in Dhaka in April 2004 and accepted at a meeting of the inspectors-general this January.

 We have agreed upon the joint surveillance from July. But we are yet to finalise a date for its start as a confirmation is awaited from the BDR, said R.C. Saxena, the BSFs principal staff officer in Calcutta.

 During patrolling, the forces will not go beyond demarcated areas. Both BSF and BDR personnel will move along zero lines. Emphasis will be laid on areas from where large-scale smuggling and infiltration are reported ? Chapra in Nadia and Jalangi in Murshidabad for example. Officers from both sides will hold meetings daily at the beginning and end of patrolling, Saxena said. 

 Initially. the patrolling will be held during the day. Later, we will extend it to night, an official added.

 India and Bangladesh share a 4,100-km border, 2,100 km of which is with Bengal. After Nadia, the simultaneous coordinated patrolling along the Indo-Bangla border will begin in North 24-Parganas, Murshidabad and Malda. Meghalaya, Tripura and Manipur will be included on the list later.

 The patrolling is expected to help resolve disputes over fencing. Such an exercise along the Indo-Pak border in Punjab and Rajasthan has proved fruitful, an officer said.

 Apart from manning the porous border, Saxena said, the purpose of the patrolling was to understand each others problems. It will give the BDR an opportunity to understand why we blame it for infiltration and accuse it of allowing militant camps on its territory. There are allegations of BSF atrocities on Bangladesh villages. The BDR can also prove its point, he added.

 Mock trials with BDR personnel have begun in Nadia, Malda and Murshidabad. BSF inspector-general R.K. Pachnanda said: We have to build a rapport with them.

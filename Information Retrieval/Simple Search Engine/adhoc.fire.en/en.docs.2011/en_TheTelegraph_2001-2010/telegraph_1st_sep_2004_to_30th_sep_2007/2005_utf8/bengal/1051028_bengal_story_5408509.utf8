 Two fugitives, 

two policies

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Oct. 27: One is a CPM minister and a fugitive from justice. The other is a Congress MP facing an arrest warrant.

 While Narayan Biswas, the minister charged with torching the houses of Congress supporters, is roaming free, Adhir Chowdhury, accused of twin murders, faces the threat of his properties being attached if he does not surrender.

 In Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee?s Bengal, two sets of rules seem to govern the police?s approach to VIP fugitives.

 The chief minister, however, denied that political colour defines police action. ?No, that?s not true, only one criterion will be followed,? he said today. Asked why Narayan was not being arrested, Bhattacharjee said: ?Just wait for two to three days.?

 Earlier, the chief minister had brushed off queries on the police?s forked approach towards the two fugitive leaders, saying: ?I do not answer every question.?

 State CPM secretary Anil Biswas said Narayan is busy attending to the party?s organisational work.

 Murshidabad zilla sabhadhipati Siddika Begum today led a Congress team to Writers? Buildings, where they met chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb and alleged that Chowdhury had been falsely implicated. 

 Earlier this week, Murshidabad district police chief Niraj Singh had threatened to attach Chowdhury?s properties if he did not turn himself in.

 ?Properties can be attached on court orders, so what the Murshidabad SP meant to say was that the police would seek orders from the court to attach Chowdhury?s properties,? Deb told Siddika.

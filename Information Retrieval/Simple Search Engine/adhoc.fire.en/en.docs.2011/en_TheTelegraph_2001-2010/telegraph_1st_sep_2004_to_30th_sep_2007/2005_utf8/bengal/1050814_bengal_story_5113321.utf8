 Law class shield for high-tech ideas

 - IIT Kharagpur plans school on intellectual property to protect assets

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Kharagpur, Aug. 13: The seat of technological innovation in the country is now gearing up to protect ideas from being stolen.

 The Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur will set up a school of intellectual property law, the first of its kind in the country, Vinod Gupta, a distinguished alumnus of the countrys oldest IIT, said during its 51st convocation.

 India is producing incredible amounts of intellectual property in the form of research and new inventions and we need to protect that intellectual property of our scientists, engineers and other professionals, said Gupta, while announcing the plan during his convocation speech.

 That means we must have a school of intellectual property law to protect and grow our assets, he said.

 Siddhartha Brahma was awarded the President of India gold medal, Dipanjan Das was given the B.C. Roy memorial gold medal and Arindam Basu received the Prime Minister of India gold medal at the convocation.

 Gupta recounted, during the 30-minute speech, how his stint at the institute changed his life. The US-based businessman, who has helped in setting up a B-school on the campus through generous emoluments, said the law school would be named after late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

 Kalyan Chakraborti, the former dean of the school of management, has been entrusted with working out the details of the programme.

 The authorities are also planning to augment infrastructure facilities at IIT Kharagpur. Sanjiv Goenka, chairman of the board of governors of the institute, said there would be an emphasis on improving and adding to the existing infrastructure on the campus, which would include upgrading hostels and laboratories. 

 Creating world-class infrastructure is very important for an institute like IIT. We have spent around Rs 30 crore on that in the past few years. Over the next two years, we plan to invest around Rs 40 crore to upgrade various facilities on campus, said the board chairman.

 The world class convention centre ? work on which has recently started ? on the campus would be complete in the next 24 months, Goenka said.

 During the convocation ceremony, the institute bestowed special honours on two of its distinguished alumni A.C. Wadhwa and Sanjay Kumar Mukherjee. Industrialist R.P. Goenka was awarded an honorary DSc degree for his contribution to the development of Indian industry and for his efforts to raise the standard of technical education in the country.

 S.K. Dube, director, IIT, said: In honouring R.P. Goenka, IIT Kharagpur honours his unique contribution to Indian business, Indian management, his philanthropy, and his deep commitment to spread education, particularly in the field of technology and business management. 

 He also talked about the bio-technology park that the institute is planning to set up.

 We have had discussions with the industries and commerce minister Nirupam Sen recently. We have appealed to the government to provide 200 acres of land near Kharagpur, and to provide the seed money as well. We have to submit a detailed plan to see the project through, said Dube.

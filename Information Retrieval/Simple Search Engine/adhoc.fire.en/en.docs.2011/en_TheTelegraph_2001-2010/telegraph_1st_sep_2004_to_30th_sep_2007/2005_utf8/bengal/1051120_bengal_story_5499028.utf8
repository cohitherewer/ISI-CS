 Cop-van hit sparks clash

 Krishnagar, Nov. 19: Residents of Ranaghat in Nadia clashed with police this morning after a police van hit two persons, reports our correspondent.

 The mob smashed the van and assaulted constables Santosh Ghosh and Suresh Hala and driver Saktipada Mitra, who was allegedly drunk.

 Bhakti Ghosh and Raju Ghosh were taken to the Ranaghat subdivisional hospital. Bhakti was later shifted to NRS Medical College in Calcutta. Four policemen and 20 people were injured in the clash.

 When police forces reached the spot, about 65 km from Calcutta, and resorted to a lathicharge, a pitched battle ensued. The mob blocked NH 34 for four hours but dispersed after officials assured action if the driver was found guilty.

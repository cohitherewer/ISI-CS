 Minister salary stays put

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 5: The government has decided not to increase ministers salaries and emoluments, though the Assembly passed a bill yesterday hiking legislators salaries. 

 There will be no increase in the ministers salaries, finance minister Asim Dasgupta told reporters at Writers Buildings this afternoon. He added that Bengal was the only state where ministers got such meagre amounts.

 The no-hike announcement came in the wake of last weeks cabinet meeting in which the chief minister requested colleagues to sacrifice for a greater cause when they raised the issue. 

 The Bengal Legislative Assembly (Members emoluments) (Amendment) Bill, 2005, is likely to ensure MLAs a mon- thly pay of Rs 7,000, including allowances. The chief minister now gets about Rs 8,500 a month and his cabinet colleagues about 1,000 less.

 Salaries of the Speaker, Hashim Abdul Halim, and the deputy Speaker, Kripasindhu Saha, have already been enhanced by Rs 1,000. Halim will be paid Rs 5,000 in addition to the existing allowances, Saha will get Rs 4,000 plus the perks.

 22 years on, boy at home

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 26: Around 6.30 on Sunday evening, Kader Ali saw a man with greying hair walking towards his betel shop. As he peered at the unkempt figure, familiar but not really, he suddenly recognised his childhood friend.

 Kader, a resident of Uttarchandamari village in Nadias Madanpur, about 65 km from Calcutta, jumped with joy as he rushed to embrace Zulfikar Mondal who had left home 22 years ago. 

 Having protested against his fathers decision to pay dowry for his sisters wedding, Zulfikar could not stay on at home. 

 He is 42 now. Kader dragged him home shouting all the way Zulfikar bechey achhey, phirey eshechhey (Zulfikar is alive, hes back).

 Zulfikars 70-year-old father Mansoor Ali and mother Sabeda Bibi, 60, could not believe what they saw. Sabeda clasped him hard in a hug and broke down. As word spread, the village converged on the house. 

 I feel sorry for what I did. I had slapped him when he opposed my paying dowry for Momenas marriage. He had asked me to call off the wedding, said Mansoor, remembering another evening, 22 years ago.

 The next morning, the 20-year-old who had studied till Class X left home for Rajabazar in Calcutta, where he had friends. I was very depressed. My father was a poor man and I could not bear to see him having to spend so much to marry my sister off, he said today. 

 Mansoor paid Rs 5,000 and gave jewellery and furniture to Momenas husband, a well-to-do farmer with whom she lives in Haringhata, 10 km away. 

 My friends told me to go to Bihar to seek a job. But my journey turned out to be a disaster. A co-passenger drugged me and took away all my money. I woke up to find myself in Uttar Pradesh, Zulfikar said. He then travelled to Ajmer Sharif in Rajasthan. Someone in the train had told him that he would find food and shelter there. 

 I sold caps there?. I thought I would return home a big businessman, but was slowly reduced to a beggar.

 Home should be warmer for him. Mansoor has already given him his 5 bighas to till.

 Zulfikars brother Anisur, who has set up his own business, is not complaining.

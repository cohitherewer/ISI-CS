 BRIEFS

 Midnapore, Oct. 31: A monkey held residents of a school hostel in Midnapore town hostage today until fire brigade personnel rescued them.

 Seven Class XII students of Vidyasagar Vidyapith, 130 km from Calcutta, who had taken it upon themselves to chase the animal away, had to be escorted out. The monkey, which sat through a lecture in Class VII and hopped into headmaster Saroj Mitras office during lunch earlier, entered Class III this morning and sat beside the headmistress of the primary section, Sipra Samanta. It did not harm anyone.

 The Class XII boys, who followed the monkey with sticks and firecrackers, were attacked. Sandip Maity had to be given seven stitches on his hand. After that, the students retreated, but the monkey parked itself right outside the hostel gate and chased back boys venturing out.

 Burdwan: Results of the BCom Part-I (general) examination of Burdwan University were declared cancelled on Monday. Over 2,500 students who had appeared in the exam had been awarded wrong marks because of an error by a local computer firm responsible for preparing mark sheets. The students will be issued fresh marks sheets, vice-chancellor Amit Mallick said.

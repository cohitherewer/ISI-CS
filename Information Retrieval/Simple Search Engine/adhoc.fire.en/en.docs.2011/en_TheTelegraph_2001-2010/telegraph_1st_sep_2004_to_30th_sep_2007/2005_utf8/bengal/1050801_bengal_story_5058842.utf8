 Calcutta, July 31: Subrata Mukherjee today announced his decision to return to the Congress, but three of his loyalists left him for Mamata Banerjee.

 Tapas Roy, Paresh Pal and Ashok Deb parted ways with the former mayor even as he announced his decision go back to his former party at a convention of the Paschimbanga Unnayan Congress Mancha in south Calcutta.

 The trio ? Trinamul Congress MLAs from Burrobazar, Manicktala and Budge Budge ? had played an active role when Mukherjee broke away from Mamata to float the Mancha in the run-up to the city civic elections last month. The three had also promised to be with the forum till next years Assembly elections. 

 They gave a miss to the much-hyped convention citing engagements elsewhere. 

 Roy, when contacted, said he still considers himself a Trinamul man and Mamata my leader. Pal and Deb could not be contacted till late tonight. 

 With only three rebel Trinamul MLAs ? Nirbed Roy, Paras Dutt and Ambika Banerjee ? by his side on a lacklustre dais, Mukherjee announced that the four of them and five Calcutta Municipal Corporation councillors would formally re-enter the Congress next month. 

 Our Mancha will die a natural death as we have all decided to rejoin the Congress, Mukherjee said, hours after the convention.

 Observers said Mukherjee, facing political oblivion after the abysmal performance of the Congress-Mancha combine in the civic polls, was left with no choice. It will be interesting to see how Mukherjee is rehabilitated in the Congress, said an analyst. 

 Mukherjee said a resolution on sending an appeal to Congress president Sonia Gandhi to admit those who had once floated the Mancha was adopted today. We want to strengthen the Congress in Bengal so that it can fight the CPM effectively, he said.

 State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said Mukherjee had acted judiciously. Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy said his politics was opportunistic.

 As a batch of Trinamul leaders switched sides, two Congress MLAs ? Abdul Mannan and Shankar Singh ? said they had done no wrong by calling on Mamata at her Delhi residence on Friday night to discuss post-poll politics. 

 On his return from the capital, Singh said: We discussed at length how to avoid a split in anti-CPM votes and bring all secular forces on a common platform to take on the CPM in the Assembly polls.

 He also wanted Pranab Mukherjee to quit as the state Congress chief. A person who has to placate the CPM in Delhi cannot lead a strong movement against the same party in Bengal. His dual stand sends a wrong signal to the party rank and file and the people.

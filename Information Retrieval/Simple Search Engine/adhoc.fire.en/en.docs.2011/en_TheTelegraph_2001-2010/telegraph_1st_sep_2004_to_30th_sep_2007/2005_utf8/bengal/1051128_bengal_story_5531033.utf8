 Hunt on for killer brother

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Barasat, Nov. 27: A 65-year-old man is suspected of murdering his brother, 30 years younger than him, at Dum Dum.

 Prasanta Banerjee has been missing since a maid discovered the body of his 35-year-old brother Biswanath lying in a pool of blood on his bed this morning. 

 Last night, Prasanta was at the Bipin Ganguly Street address in Dum Dum, where Biswanath used to live with his 86-year-old mother.

 Police said Prasanta, a part-time lecturer at a private engineering college in Asansol, used to visit his mother and brother ? who is said to be mentally unsound ? every weekend. 

 A hunt is on for Prasanta, North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Praveen Kumar said. We tried calling him at his Asansol flat this afternoon but no one picked up the phone. We have also alerted Asansol police. Although we dont have conclusive evidence that he murdered his younger brother, we dont rule out his involvement.

 An officer from Dum Dum police station said Prasanta was at Biswanaths place throughout yesterday and the brothers quarrelled several times. Biswanath left the house in the evening and was seen at Dum Dum railway station. Around 9.30 pm, the maid brought him home, the officer said.

 The family then had dinner and went to bed around 11. On Sunday morning ? around 7 ? the maid went to Biswanaths room and found him dead. His forehead was smashed, an investigator said.

 Police said Biswanath had the habit of banging his head against the wall when he became excited. 

 Last year, he underwent a brain surgery at a nursing home in Calcutta. Prasanta had borne the cost of the operation, which amounted to around Rs 2 lakh, they added.

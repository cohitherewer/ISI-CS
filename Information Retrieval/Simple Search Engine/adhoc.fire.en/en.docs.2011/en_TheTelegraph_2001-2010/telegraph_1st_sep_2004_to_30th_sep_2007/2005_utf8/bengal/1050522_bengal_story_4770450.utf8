 Task force to stem fraud at hospitals

 BAPPA MAJUMDAR

 Calcutta, May 21: The government has decided to set up a special task force of health department officials to check financial irregularities and frame charges against persons responsible for buying medical equipment without need or at astronomical prices.

 The move comes in the backdrop of financial irregularities rocking state-run hospitals in the city.

 We have taken note of the kind of irregularities occurring in hospitals and have received detailed reports. The government, therefore, has decided to initiate a high-level probe at all hospitals, C.R. Maiti, the director of medical education said.

 We will find out each and every minute detail of the scam and punish the guilty, he told The Telegraph today.

 The latest scam to hit a government hospital was free treatment forms signed by a senior official at SSKM Hospital, without the knowledge of the medical superintendent.

 I have sent a report to the government. Very strangely, someone authorised to award free treatment facilities to patients had signed on a blank document, said Santanu Tripathi, the medical superintendent and vice-principal. 

 Officials suspect that the persons involved in the racket might have received money from either the patient or the investigation department for issuing the recommendation certificates.

 Other city hospitals have also dug out cases where out-patients department tickets have been misused by doctors and expensive investigations carried out, despite the ticket not mentioning the tests. There are cases where doctors might be involved in the scam as well. Therefore, it is important that an inquiry is carried out, said a senior health department official.

 The decision to conduct a full-fledged inquiry was taken shortly after authorities at SSKM Hospital found out during an internal audit session that counterparts of bills issued to patients were not handed over to the financial accounts section by the cash collectors. The cash collectors were keeping the counterparts and the money.

 We not only detected anomalies in the amount scribbled in the counterparts, but the persons assigned to hand over the bills to hospital authorities actually made off with the cash as well as the bills, making the hospital poorer and themselves richer with every deal, said a senior hospital official who first lifted the veil on the Rs 8 lakh financial scam.

 Officials have found that four persons indicted in the scam had kept the money in their homes and a police complaint has been lodged. A section of sweepers, cash collectors and ward masters are on the list of suspects.

 A few weeks ago, a similar case was reported from the BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children, where an internal audit revealed a scam involving bills of over Rs 70,000. The person involved in the scam has returned the money, but will be interrogated for further leads, said an official of the hospital.

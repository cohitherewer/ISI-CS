 Job hunter missing

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 27: A 23-year-old woman who had quit a call centre job last month and left home in Nadias Kalyani on December 24 to appear for an interview at another call centre has not returned home.

 It is not known whether Kiron Adhikari went missing from Salt Lake, where she was headed, or elsewhere.

 Her father, a railway offi-cer, said she was a bright student and had completed her CBSE Plus II with 80 per cent marks in 2002. After that, she got a degree in IT from Manipal Universitys Salt Lake campus. 

 Kiron completed the course this year, added Mrinal Adhikari, 52, who lodged a missing diary with police after looking for his daughter at all probable places.

 Kirons mother Krishna has suffered a cerebral attack after getting to know about the disappearance last Saturday. The 45-year-old woman was admitted to a nursing home in Kalyani, some 50 km from Calcutta.

 Kiron, who stayed in a rented flat in Salt Lake with a girl doing an IT course in another institute, got her first job while studying.

 But her father was not happy. Mrinal said she fell into bad company and that he persuaded her to quit her job and get rid of it. 

 She used to smoke and drink and go to night clubs.... I fear my daughter has been kidnapped and is being forced into something really dark. I never liked the sort of company she kept and I forced her to leave her job at the call centre, he said.

 According to her father, Kiron was trying to avoid some youths of late. 

 They might have a hand in her disappearance. I do not even know whether she is alive, he said.

 Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajsekharan said: We are on the job. We are in touch with our North 24-Parganas counterparts.

 A technical officer posted in the railways Kanchrapara workshop, Mrinal has also lodged a complaint with the CID in Calcutta. 

 His only child, he said, left home around 10 am on Saturday for the interview. 

 Around 5 pm, she called on my mobile and told me that she would reach home by 8.30. But that is the last time we spoke. She never came back, Mrinal said, trying to hold back his tears.

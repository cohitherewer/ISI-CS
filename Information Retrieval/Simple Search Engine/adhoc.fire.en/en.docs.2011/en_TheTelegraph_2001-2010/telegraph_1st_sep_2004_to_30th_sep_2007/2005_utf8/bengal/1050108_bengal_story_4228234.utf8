 SC pressure on state to pay arrears

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: The Supreme Court today directed the personnel of the West Bengal Border Wing Home Guard to ask the state government to pay their back wages in view of its earlier order regularising them in the service. 

 A division bench of Justices Y.K. Sabharwal and D.M. Dharmadhikari asked the petitioners? counsel, Sanjib Sen, to ask them to file applications with the state and gave him liberty to bring the matter to its notice again if Writers? Buildings failed to pay the wages in reasonable time.

 Sen said Bengal chief secretary Asok Gupta and principal secretary, home, A.K. Deb may face contempt of the apex court as the arrears have not been paid yet. 

 In Calcutta, Deb said all dues have been paid. ?Now they (the personnel) are claiming more. We have informed our advocate about it.?

 Trinamul boots out mayor critic 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Ghosh: ?Homeward? bound?

 Calcutta, Feb. 5: Pradip Ghosh, mayor-in-council member in charge of health, in the Calcutta Municipal corporation was removed and also expelled from the Trinamul Congress for six years on the charge of anti-party activities. 

 Mayor Subrata Mukherjee tonight said Amiya Mukherjee, party councillor from ward 48, will replace Ghosh. He will be sworn in as MIC member tomorrow. 

 ?I had to remove Ghosh for some of his recent activities,? said Mukherjee, who got party chief Mamata Banerjee?s assent during a one-to-one meeting on Thursday night. Ghosh received two letters ? one from the mayor removing him from his post and another from Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi informing him of the disciplinary action committee?s decision. 

 Ghosh, who had been shifted from the bustee and parking department to health against his will, seems set to join the Congress and contest the June civic polls under its flag. 

 Sources said Ghosh incurred the mayor?s wrath for criticising him publicly and allegedly hobnobbing with a section of Congress and CPM leaders. The disciplinary action committee, which met this afternoon, said Ghosh had made ?indecent remarks? about Mukherjee several times and tried to ?break the municipal party with an ulterior motive?. 

 Ghosh denied the charge, but conceded he was in touch with the Congress. ?I don?t think I have done anything wrong by maintaining links with the Congress. We were able to capture the CMC board with Congress support,? he said. 

 Asked why he had been vocal against the mayor, Ghosh said: ?Mukherjee has been concentrating on projects in south Calcutta and neglecting the north. Perhaps I incurred his wrath for pointing this out.? 

 The angry leader today vowed to take revenge on Mukherjee in the coming civic polls. ?We have seen how a hi-tech chief minister like Chandrababu Naidu was trounced in the elections for turning a blind eye on the people?s problems. I will see to it that this hi-tech mayor does not get re-elected in the June CMC polls,? he said.

 The development has come as a boon to the state Congress, which has been desperately trying to split Trinamul at various levels. ?We will welcome Ghosh if he wants to return to our party. We hope others like him in the Trinamul municipal party will follow suit and strengthen the Congress on the eve of the civic polls,? said leader Somen Mitra. 

 Last week, several Trinamul councillors of the Bolpur municipality joined the Congress.

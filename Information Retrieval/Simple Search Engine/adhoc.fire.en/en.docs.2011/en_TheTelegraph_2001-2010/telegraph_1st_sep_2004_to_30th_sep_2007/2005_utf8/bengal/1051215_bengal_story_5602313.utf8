 BRIEFS

 Behrampore, Dec. 14: The additional district judge of Behrampore today came down heavily on police and the additional public prosecutor for failing to produce the case diary of the twin murder for which Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury has been arrested.

 Bring it within half an hour, Sourish Chakraborty ordered after Chowdhury moved the court for bail. The police, however, could not fetch the diary. Officials informed the court, through the prosecutor, that the homeguard who had the keys to the cupboard in which the diary was kept was on leave. 

 Chowdhury was produced at the chief judicial magistrates court in connection with the same case. The magistrate transferred the case to the district judges court and fixed the hearing on December 22. 

 Durgapur: Police on Wednesday wielded the lathi to disperse about 1,500 students of junior basic training (JBT) institutes in Burdwan district who were staging a road block on National Highway-II at the Panagarh crossing, 180 km from Calcutta. About a dozen students were injured. The police said the students were protesting against Calcutta High Courts order to close down 40 private JBT institutes as they lack infrastructure. 

 Midnapore: Two members of the CPM district committee in West Midnapore ? Sukur Ali and Tapan Misra ? apprehending arrest in connection with the Chhoto Angaria massacre, in which 11 people were allegedly murdered by their party supporters in 2001, have withdrawn their anticipatory bail pleas. 

 Barasat: Gopal Chandra Seal, a lawyer from Barasat, on Wednesday lodged a complaint with the chief judicial magistrate against a police officer, who allegedly beat him up. Seal said he had gone to Barsat police station to file a complaint. But officer Supriyo Bose turned him away. When the lawyer insisted, Bose allegedly assaulted him.

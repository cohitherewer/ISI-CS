 Police see scrap in realtor kill

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 26: A fortnight after the murder of Baguiati- based realtor Pranab Deb, sleuths have come to know that he wanted to make money by stealing machinery from closed factories and had developed rivalry with associates who killed him.

 Deb was brother of former CPM MLA from Mograhat Anuradha Deb and brother-in-law of Party for Democratic Socialism leader Samir Putatunda.

 The arrest of a trio, Manoj Shaw, Surojit Das and Guddu, from Cuttack in Orissa late last night led to the details about Debs dealings. Six people have so far been held in the case. 

 On November 13, his body, bruised all over, was found in a heap of garbage about half-a-kilometre from his Shyamnagar Road apartment. Preliminary investigations had revealed that Debs involvement in the local construction business might have led to the murder. 

 The reason is now clear to us. He had joined a group infamous for stealing machine-parts from closed factories in North 24-Parganas and Hooghly. Deb was pouring his profit into the business, said an officer.

 District police chief Praveen Kumar said a hunt is on for the duo which killed him.

 Teen quartet goes missing

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Dec. 28: Four teenagers have been missing since Monday from Krishnagunj in Nadia.

 Among them is Moumita Roy, a Class X student, who is scheduled to appear for Madhyamik next year.

 The daughter of Debaprasad Roy, an affluent businessman, was last seen in school uniform on Monday morning travelling in a cycle van in Krishnagunj, 110 km from Calcutta, with three boys ? Mrityunjoy Biswas, Kishore Biswas and Sukhesh Biswas ? aged between 15 and 16.

 The boys fathers ? well-to-do farmers ? have lodged missing diaries. Police said the needle of suspicion points towards the three schoolboys.

 Moumitas father lodged a missing diary last night but has not brought charges against the boys. He, however, said in his complaint that his daughter was last seen with Mrityunjoy, Kishore and Sukhesh.

 Nadia superintendent of police R. Rajshekharan said he had asked Krishnagunj police to launch an intense search.

 If the girls father lodges an FIR against the boys, we will arrest them. But we have to find them first. We are not ruling out the possibility that they are hiding somewhere close by, the SP said.

 Moumitas father suspects his daughter had an affair with Mrityunjoy, a Class X student. The boys who lured my daughter away are also from respectable families. I will wait for a day and see whether my daughter returns. If she comes back safely, I dont want to lodge a complaint against the boys. Or else, I will be forced to lodge an FIR, said Debaprasad. Schoolchildren these days are losing their innocence fast.

 Police said Moumita left home around 8.30 am on Monday for her private tutors house on her way to school. But her tutor told her parents that she had not been there.

 When she did not return in the evening, we went to her tutors house in an adjoining village. But he told us that Moumita did not visit his house. Some villagers said they saw her on a cycle van with Mrityunjoy, Kishore and Sukhesh, said Moumitas uncle Tapan.

 Mrityunjoys father Manmatha Biswas said he was ashamed that his son was being accused of having a hand in Moumitas disappearance. My son is also missing from Monday morning. I have asked police to trace him.

 Subhas kept waiting at door

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Subhas: What now?

 Calcutta, March 7: The doors to the state CPM secretariat remained bolted for transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, waiting for admission to the policy-making body.

 The CPM brass today reconstituted the body leaving a vacancy. ?We did not find it necessary to make changes in a core body that ran the party well in the past three years,? state CPM secretary Anil Biswas said. 

 ?Some quarters had speculated on Subhasda, but the party is in no way responsible for such speculation,? he added. 

 Biswas, with some others, oversaw the reconstitution of the secretariat at a meeting of the state committee today. 

 The seat vacated by Chittabrata Majumder, who quit the committee as well as the secretariat last month because of his assignment as the Citu?s all-India general secretary, will continue to be vacant. The secretariat?s effective strength thus stands reduced to 15 members from 16.

 Neither Chakraborty nor any of his close associates ? state Citu president Shyamal Chakraborty for example ? were present at the state committee meeting. They were attending a conference of the All-India Transport Workers? Federation in Siliguri. 

 Sources said the transport minister expressed dismay at the party?s decision.

 After Majumder?s exit, party functionaries close to Chakraborty felt he would be inducted into the reconstituted secretariat. 

 Observers said the party?s refusal to induct anyone in Majumder?s place shows the leadership?s unhappiness with the minister?s role since the last time the secretariat was reconstituted in 2002.

 At the state conference held in Howrah that year, Chakraborty?s hopes to get accommodated in the secretariat were dashed by allegations of his involvement with criminals picked up from an athletes? accommodation inside Salt Lake stadium. 

 The transport minister then criticised police for raiding the stadium. 

 The party chose housing minister Gautam Deb, who is junior to Chakraborty, for the secretariat.

 Midnapore, Dec. 20: Miscreants broke the right hand of Aghar Roy, the block development officer of Belpahari in West Midnapore, and beat him up while he was returning from Jhargram after attending a meeting tonight. 

 His driver, Aftab Ajam, is now in Jhargram Government Hospital, 150 km from Calcutta. West Midnapore superintendent of police Ajay Nanda said the goons had spread nails on NH6 to stop the car.

 No entry at home for actor mom

 OUR BUREAU 

 June 25: A day after the high court asked Chandernagore police to help Mira Pal ? mother of actor and Trinamul Congress MLA Tapas Pal ? enter her locked house, the police are yet to implement the order.

 We are completely in the dark about the court order. We have not received any communique and, therefore, cannot help her now, Hooghly superintendent of police Supratim Sarkar said today. The local police pleaded ignorance. 

 Pal (picture above), through his lawyer, alleged that his sisters had conspired and instigated his mother to lodge a criminal case against him. My client has been falsely implicated. He has full respect for his mother. His four married sisters want to deprive him of property rights and they somehow managed to influence their mother to lodge a case against Pal, lawyer Saptangshu Basu said. He claimed that Pal did not lock up his mothers house and the allegation of driving her out was incorrect. 

 Following a petition moved by Mira Pal, Justice Asim Banerjee had on Wednesday asked the police to help her enter her house and also ensure her security. She had alleged that her son was torturing her mentally by repeatedly asking her to make him co-sharer of her bank accounts. He is also forcing me to sell out the building on 6 cottahs? which was built by my husband, a doctor, she said.

 Buddha plays hardball, GNLF thickens plot

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 18: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is ?fed up? with Subash Ghisingh and his party?s obstinate opposition to the hill elections.

 ?He (Ghisingh) has been raising one demand after another and stalling the elections to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) for no reason whatsoever,? the chief minister told the Assembly, replying to the governor?s address.

 Leaving for Delhi tomorrow, he is expected to discuss the impasse with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 

 Bhattacharjee said he would thrash out at the meeting a way to go about the polls. Any decision made after that would be binding. ?Everyone concerned will have to follow whatever comes of that meeting on March 20.?

 But the GNLF continued to keep the issue burning. Its Kurseong MLA Shanta Chhetri caused a flutter in the House handing copies of a resolution adopted by the DGHC councillors to the chief minister and Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim, saying ?Subash Ghisingh should be the sole caretaker of the council once its term expires on March 25?. 

 In the face of the GNLF?s opposition to the hill council polls, the government had decided to appoint an administrator with caretaker powers. There is a stiff opposition to Ghisingh?s appointment to the post.

 Chhetri had earlier said the hills ?would be in flames? again if the government did not concede its demands and then scaled down the threat saying the GNLF was happy with the chief minister?s assurance. ?I am sure that the state government will respect the resolution adopted by an elected body,? she said today.

 The government, Bhattacharjee said earlier, acceded to some of Ghisingh?s demands only to maintain peace in the hills. ?I cannot understand his rationale,? he added.

 Chhetri said a move was afoot to put someone or several persons under Ghisingh to act as watchdogs after he was made the caretaker. ?We?ll not tolerate this conspiracy. We want Ghisingh to be the sole administrator and will not bear with an outsider. If the government wants to form a board of administrators, it should be selected from among the councillors,? she demanded, again threatening an agitation. 

 The letter in hand, Bhattacharjee said: ?Once again the GNLF is raising another demand that is hard to explain.?

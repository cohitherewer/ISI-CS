 Somen fights to keep Sealdah

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 31: Chowringhee a more posh address than Sealdah? Dont even suggest it to Somen Mitra.

 The Congress veteran, who counts Sealdah almost as his second name, is upset with the delimitation commissions decision to rename the constituency Chowringhee after its boundaries have been redrawn.

 The Congress has already asked that the seat continue to be known by its old name. The CPM, however, wants it named Bowbazar-Chowringhee. 

 A whole lot of proposals relating to name changes have been placed before the commission, a senior official associated with delimitation said today.

 The exercise will change many constituencies voter profile in a major way ? which may cost long-time winners in votes ? yet to many of them its the name change thats the sore point.

 Many of them have over time got so closely linked with their constituencies in peoples minds that a change in name seems almost an attack on their own identity. 

 The Forward Bloc wants Kabitirtha ? Kalimuddin Shamss seat ? to retain its name even when it becomes part of a larger constituency, proposed to be named Calcutta Port.

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees Jadavpur will now be part of two constituencies, one of which will continue to be called Jadavpur with the other being named Garia. The CPM, however, wants the latter called Netaji Nagar.

 At least 12 proposals relating to constituency names will be heard by the commission in Delhi on June 8. 

 The idea behind delimitation is to have Assembly segments of roughly the same population, chief electoral officer Basudeb Banerjee said. 

 Though Bengal will still have 294 constituencies, Calcutta will have 10 instead of the current 21 while North and South 24-Parganas and the north Bengal districts will get additional seats.

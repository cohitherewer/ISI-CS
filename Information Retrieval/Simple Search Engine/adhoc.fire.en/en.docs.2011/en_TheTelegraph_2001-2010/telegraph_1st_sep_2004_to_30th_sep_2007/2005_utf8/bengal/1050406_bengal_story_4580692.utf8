 Great Eastern exit door open again

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 5: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government today announced a fresh opportunity for Great Eastern Hotel employees to apply for the early retirement scheme.

 They had been asked to apply between February 25 and March 26 but not one opted for the scheme. The new time-frame opens tomorrow and closes on April 18, both days inclusive, tourism secretary T.K. Barman said at Writers? Buildings today.

 ?We are under the impression ? on the basis of inputs from various sources ? that some employees have not been able to apply for the scheme even if they wanted to. They have expressed that given an opportunity, they will apply. So we are now giving them that option,? the officer added.

 Many employees had said union leaders prevented them from applying for the scheme. ?I cannot reveal how we gathered the information, but some people wanted a fresh opportunity,? Barman said.

 Rajdeo Goala, a leader of the Citu, the CPM?s trade union wing, said today?s move was positive because ?extending the option for applying for the ERS only shows the government is creating an atmosphere to discuss the matter?.

 Intuc leader and mayor Subrata Mukherjee said his union would not accept the scheme or the new opportunity.

 The government has this time opened another form collection and submission counter at 2 Brabourne Road, the tourism directorate office, where an official of the rank of deputy secretary would be in charge.

 Barman said the new counter was selected away from the Great Eastern premises because ?some employees might be embarrassed to get the ERS forms from the hotel or feel like being separated from the rest if they are found to collect forms from the hotel premises?.

 Forms will continue to be distributed and submitted at Great Eastern.

 ?After April 18, even if we find that one employee has applied, he would be given his dues under the scheme as it is not dependent on the number of people who apply,? Barman said.

 The applicants will be informed by the hotel?s member-secretary about the date of clearance of dues 15 days after the April 18 deadline.

 The scheme?s structure, Barman said, remains unchanged. Notices informing employees of the new development have already been sent from Writers? to be put up at the hotel.

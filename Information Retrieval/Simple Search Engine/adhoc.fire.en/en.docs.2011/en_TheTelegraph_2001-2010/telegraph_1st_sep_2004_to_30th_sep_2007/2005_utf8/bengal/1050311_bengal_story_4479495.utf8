 Court raps DM on land grab

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 10: Calcutta High Court today directed Burdwan district magistrate Subrata Gupta, to appear before it on March 21 for his failure to submit a report on agricultural land allegedly being grabbed for setting up an industry.

 The court asked why contempt proceedings should not be initiated against the district magistrate for flouting its order of filing a report on the alleged land grab by today.

 On November 23, Purnanda Chatterjee moved the high court alleging that a 12-bigha agricultural plot owned by his family at Gopalpur had been grabbed by an ?influential CPM leader?.

 Chatterjee said he had told the civic authorities of Asansol and Durgapur that the company took possession of the land, under Kanksa police station in Durgapur, though neither had the government acquired it nor had he sold it.

 Justice Pranab Kumar Chattopaddhaya had on February 12 asked the Burdwan district magistrate to file a report on the alleged grabbing of land by the CPM leader by today.

 BRIEFS

 Burdwan, Nov. 6: The state electricity board has decided to record on camera raids it conducts on pilferers.

 Eight state electricity board divisions in Burdwan and Birbhum have been chosen for the launch of the new system. The Electricity (West Bengal Amendment) Bill, 2005, makes power theft a non-bailable offence. Special courts have been set up to try such cases. 

 Next time we go on a raid, we will record it on video and digital cameras and place the pictures as evidence. Many move court after being caught stealing power or on being told to pay their dues. The cases drag for months, said Manojit Pal, a power board manager. Between 10 and 14 per cent of electricity in the grid is stolen in the districts. If 1 per cent is prevented, the power board will save Rs 150 crore in a year.

 Krishnagar: The chief minister said on Sunday that Muslims need reservation because they are the most backward in Bengal. He also told a rally: We are in talks with the Centre about how job and other reservations can be introduced.

 Ranaghat: A 21-year-old girl was molested and her sister beaten up by six youths here in Nadia on Saturday. The incident occurred when the siblings and several others were participating in a post-Puja programme. Sipra Das, 17, a Class IX student, had to be hospitalised with head injuries ? a result of protests against the teasing of her sister.

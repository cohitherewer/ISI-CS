 Conviction of free convict 

 - Justice at last for parents of raped girl

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 26: For Trilochan Maity, whose daughter was raped and murdered by a man who roamed free for over a decade armed with a bail order, justice was delayed but not denied.

 A division bench of the high court comprising Justices Alok Kumar Basu and Pranab Kumar Deb today upheld the order passed by the Midnapore sessions judge in 1992 sentencing Goutam Biswas for raping and killing 11-year-old Putul.

 Surprisingly, Goutam was granted bail by the high court soon after his conviction and has lived a free man since. 

 Maity, a resident of Syedpur in East Midnapore, bec- ame hopeful about getting Goutam punished once again after Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who raped and killed Hetal Parekh in Calcutta, was hanged last year. He wrote to the then Chief Justice, A.N. Roy, and sought his intervention. He assigned the case to the division bench. 

 After todays order, Goutam, whose appeal to the high court against the trial court order has been pending for 12 years, will have to go behind bars again. 

 Putuls father, who owns a paan-bidi shop at Syedpur, had told the chief justice that the Class III student went to her maternal uncles house in the same village in December 1988. A neighbourhood boy, Goutam called her to the roof of an abandoned house promising her candies around 9.30 am on December 18 and raped her. When she threatened to tell all about the incident, he throttled her and threw the body from the roof.

 Neighbours found the girl dead in a nearby bush. Officers of the local police station concluded after interrogating the neighbours and other villagers that Goutam raped and killed the girl. Goutam, who had fled then, was held in a neighbouring village.

 Then district and sessions judge, R.N. Kali, the same person who as the sessions judge of Alipore had in 1991 awarded death sentence to Dhananjoy, sentenced Goutam to life imprisonment on July 6, 1992. The convict had moved the high court against that order and obtained the bail.

 After the news about Maitys letter to the chief justice was published in The Telegraph, the district police began looking for Goutam again, but failed to trace him.

 Today, Putuls mother said: We are relieved.

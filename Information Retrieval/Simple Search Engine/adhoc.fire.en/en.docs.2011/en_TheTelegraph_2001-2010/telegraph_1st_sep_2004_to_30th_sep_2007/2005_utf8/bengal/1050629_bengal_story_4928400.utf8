 School No. 2 with fake BEd

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 28: The assistant headmaster of a Purulia school resigned from his post today after it was proved in the high court that his BEd certificate was fake. 

 Going through the documents furnished by Burdwan University, Justice Aniruddha Basu asked police to take app-ropriate action against Ram Ranjan Chatterjee, who held the post since 1998.

 The judge also asked the education department to appoint Hrid Baran Mahato, who stood second in the interview and fought a legal battle for over seven years to justify his claim to the top slot, in place of Chatterjee.

 In 1996, Sreekrishna Vidyapith of Jhalda, about 260 km west of Calcutta, issued an advertisement to fill the vacant post. Both Chatterjee and Mahato were interviewed in August 1997. But after Chatterjees appointment was announced, Mahato approached the school management alleging that he had got the job by submitting forged MSc (from Ranchi University) and BEd certificates.

 When the school authorities declined to act on the basis of his plea, Mahato lodged a complaint with the local police station. The police arrested Chatterjee and he spent a fortnight behind bars. But the school did not go back on its decision to appoint him. Mahato then moved the high court.

 Burdwan University informed the court that Chatterjee had failed in its BEd exam.

 Education department officials said over the past year, about 50 schoolteachers have been caught working on the basis of fake mark sheets. However, they could not immediately recall any assistant headmaster being caught having furnished false credentials.

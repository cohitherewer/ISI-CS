 Calcutta, Oct. 19: When the Left Front government takes on Mamata Banerjee tomorrow, industry?s might will be on its side.

 The Trinamul Congress chief?s threat to block the government?s bid to hand over ?prime agricultural land? to the Salim Group has the business lobby crying foul.

 ?This gives a bad impression of Bengal and the prevailing political scenario here. Investors have their own dynamics to assess market viability, and this particular situation certainly does not help,? said Rajesh Singh, regional director, CII, eastern region.

 The Salim Group is the first major player in decades to invest in infrastructure and manufacturing in the state. 

 Biswadeep Gupta of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce said: ?Foreign investment in the infrastructure sector is needed and needs to be supported. The government has to make sure that the necessary land reforms are made. It is a pure business transaction (and should not be mixed with politics).?

 One of Mamata?s main arguments has been that Benny Santoso, the Salim Group chief, is no Ambani, and therefore not a ?genuine entity?. 

 Nazeeb Arif, secretary-general, Indian Chamber of Commerce, countered: ?With the kind of diversified investment needed by Bengal, investors from all quarters need to come. If the Salim Group projects are a success, they will attract more FDI. After all, success breeds success. Santoso will not invest unless he knows there is going to be a good return on his investment.?

 The damage potential, if Mamata manages to stage a rasta roko, is enormous, warn industry watchers. ?It will send the wrong signal to all future investors. It has to be kept in mind that there has been a resurgence in investments in Bengal, and the momentum cannot be allowed to slow down,? said Amiya Gooptu, chairman, Bengal Initiative.

 Industry bodies are united in their cry for more foreign investments. ?Investors need to be encouraged constantly. If there is economic development in the state, that adds up to more employment opportunities. No political party can oppose economic development,? said Arif.

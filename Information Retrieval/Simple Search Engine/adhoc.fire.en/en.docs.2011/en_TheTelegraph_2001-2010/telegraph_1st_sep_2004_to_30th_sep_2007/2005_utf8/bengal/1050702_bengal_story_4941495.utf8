 Sikdar gets the stick 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 1: Former Bengal BJP president and Union minister Tapan Sikdar was today suspended from the party, a move that triggered a virtual split in the beleaguered organisation.

 Sikdar called the decision unconstitutional and said the state unit had no authority to suspend him. This is a unilateral decision without the approval of the partys rank and file, he said. 

 Even the state president cannot suspend me. He can at best recommend disciplinary action to the high command. 

 Sources later said several district party units have already sent feelers protesting against the unceremonious ouster. This will stoke resentment among grassroots BJP workers, who will rally behind Sikdar, said a senior leader. 

 Party vice-president G.D. Beriwala, who is doing the presidents job in the absence of Tathagata Roy ? he is out of town ? said the decision to suspend Sikdar was taken unanimously at a secretariat meeting held on June 29. 

 Some of his activities had harmed the organisation, particularly his decision to address meetings in the districts without the leaderships approval, Beriwala said, adding that the central leaders in Delhi had been apprised of the disciplinary measure. He was also accused of making statements against the party brass. 

 In a letter, Sikdar was told to explain within 10 days why he should not be expelled for indulging in anti-party activities. He has 10 days to justify his conduct, Beriwala said. 

 Sikdar, who dubbed the charges against him concocted and motivated, denied having received any letter regarding the suspension.

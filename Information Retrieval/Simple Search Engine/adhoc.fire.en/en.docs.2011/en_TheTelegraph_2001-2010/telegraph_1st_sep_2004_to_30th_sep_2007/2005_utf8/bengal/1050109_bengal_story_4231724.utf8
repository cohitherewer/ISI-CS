 Council chief raps schools for textbook load

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Primary schoolchildren rush out after classes. 

 Calcutta, Jan. 8: The Council for Indian School Certificate Examinations today directed all Anglo-Indian schools to immediately reduce textbook load on students till Class V. 

 ?There should be fewer textbooks for children studying till Class V in your schools. Your objective should be to ensure that children in lower classes do not end up overworked,? Francis Fanthome, the chief executive of the board, better known as the ICSE or ISC board, told a meeting of the heads of Anglo-Indian schools at Loreto House today. 

 ?The learning process should be made as much joyful as possible for every child attending your schools,? the newly-nominated MP representing the Anglo-Indian community told the heads of schools.

 The problem of too many textbooks at the primary level has worried the council for quite some time. 

 The principals of all ICSE Anglo-Indian schools can prescribe textbooks of their choice for the primary classes. 

 This is so because the council does not have a list of textbooks or a definite syllabus for the primary level. Its Class X level ICSE course covers only the secondary level.

Fanthome today also urged all affiliated schools to ensure the implementation of an ?automatic promotion? system till Class V, so that no student at the primary level would be detained. 

 The council was one of the first to introduce the Centre?s policy of decreasing school load for children at the primary level.

 However, Fanthome does not seem satisfied with the schools. 

 Though J.K. Sen, general secretary of the Bengal chapter of the Association of Heads of Anglo-Indian Schools in India, stressed that the policy of ?continuous assessment? of students and a no-detention regulation till Class V had already been introduced in almost all Anglo-Indian school, Fanthome said he was still getting reports that many schools were not adhering to the council?s guidelines. 

 On the concluding day of the meet, Fanthome also announced a string of regulations, including the introduction of environmental science as a compulsory subject from the current academic session slated to begin from April-May this year.

 In compliance with a Supreme Court order, every student between Class I and Class XII will have to write a 100-marks examination on environmental science. 

 In 2007, the paper on environmental science will be included for the first time in the ICSE and ISC examinations.

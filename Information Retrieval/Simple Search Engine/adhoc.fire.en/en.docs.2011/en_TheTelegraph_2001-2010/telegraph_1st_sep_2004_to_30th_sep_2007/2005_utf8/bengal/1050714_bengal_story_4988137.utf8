 Exam boost to sightless

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 13: The high court today directed the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government to allow eligible visually-challenged candidates to appear with scribe writers in competitive examinations for appointments in its offices.

 A division bench of Justices Aloke Kumar Chakraborty and Sailendra Prasad Talukdar also directed the government to reserve one per cent seats for disabled candidates in government jobs.

 In the same order, the judge asked the government to consider relaxation in payment of fees for blind examinees appearing for such examinations. Try to give them more time to answer questions as they will have to take the help of scribe writers, the court order said.

 The division bench observed that persons who can see have no idea about the ability of visually-challenged persons. They do very well if they are given opportunity to work, the judges said.

 The court order was passed following a public interest litigation by the Blind Persons Association challenging the validity of some advertisements released by the government not allowing the visually-challenged to sit for the exams with scribe writers.

 Appearing for the petitioner, advocate Pratik Dhar, told the court that by disallowing the blind candidates in the examinations for government jobs, the state had violated fundamental rights of the blind people.

 The lawyer also claimed that in 1995, the Centre had enacted a law to provide disabled persons with government jobs. All the state governments except Bengal are allowing blind candidates to appear in the examinations with the help of scribe writers, he said.

 Sources from the legal circle said todays order of the division bench is significant because the state will have to modify its recruitment policy after this order.

 Various associations of visually-challenged persons have been fighting over the issue, organising rallies and dharnas to press for their demand for government jobs.

 Scanner on civil service failures

 SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE

 Calcutta, March 6: A panel will probe the increasingly poor performance of candidates from the state in the Union Civil Service Examinations.

 The first session of the committee, chaired by chief secretary Asok Gupta on Saturday, discussed at length the ?basic problems? responsible for the poor showing.

 Representatives of three premier city institutions that conduct preparatory courses for the entrance tests attended the meeting. Personnel and administrative reforms secretary Trilochan Singh, higher education secretary Jawhar Sarkar, home secretary A.K. Deb, Calcutta Port Trust chairman A. Chanda, the Administrative Training Institute director, Pradosh Bhattacharya, and several retired IAS officers were also there, trying to reach the root of the malaise.

 Gupta said the government is worried. ?We are trying to improve the quality of training being imparted to the aspiring civil servants in the three recognised institutes.?

 J. Pal Chowdhury, the head of Bose?s Academy of Career Advancement, said meritorious students are no longer keen on joining the administrative services. He also admitted to shortcomings in the training ? lack of well-planned modules, quality teachers, books and published notes.

 Courses to help crack the all-India entrance tests are also offered by the Indian Institute of Social Welfare and Business Management (IISWBM) and Presidency College. 

 An official who was at the meeting said the course fees ? about Rs 10,000 for a year ? keep many meritorious students away. ?Few students can clear the tests at one go. Many have to make multiple attempts and that means more money. The good ones are often lured by other jobs in between.? 

 R.. Muhuri, the coordinator of the IISWBM course, said the committee discussed teaching procedures. ?In institutes that have mushroomed, the standard of teaching is poor and meant more for the state civil service examinations,? he added.

 A lack of awareness of career options after clearing the civil service exams, an official said, is also responsible for the dipping success graph.

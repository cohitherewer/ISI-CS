 DGHC poll pushed back

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 16: Asok Bhattacharya, the state urban development minister, today said elections to the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council cannot be held by September 24 as the notification for the polls has not been issued yet. 

 The state has extended the term of the DGHC twice. 

 Bhattacharya said a tripartite meeting would be held in Delhi next month when the Centre, the state government and the Gorkha National Liberation Front would discuss the DGHC elections. 

 However, there is no legal hurdle in granting another extension to the DGHC under Subhas Ghisinghs leadership. At the meeting, we will try to find out ways on how to hold the DGHC elections at the earliest. The elections can be held under the existing DGHC Act. This can also be organised after amending the Constitution. Bhattacharya said. 

 He clarified that Ghisingh had not demanded the inclusion of new areas. The GNLF chief had earlier asked for the inclusion of the entire Darjeeling district, parts of Dooars and Siliguri Municipal Corporation and the Siliguri Mahakuma Parishad into the DGHC.

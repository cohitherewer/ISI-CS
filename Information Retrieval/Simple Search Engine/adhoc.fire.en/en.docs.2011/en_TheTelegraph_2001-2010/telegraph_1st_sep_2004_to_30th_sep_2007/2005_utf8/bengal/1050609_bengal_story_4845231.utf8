 Jawan bail tied in knots

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 8: Calcutta High Court today granted conditional bail to a BSF jawan, accused of luring his girlfriend to physical intimacy with the promise of marriage and then dumping her.

 A division bench of Justices Amit Talukdar and S.P. Mitra asked Partha Gupta to marry the girl in three weeks and produce the marriage certificate before the court.

 The bail order will be confirmed only after submission of the marriage certificate. If the petitioner fails to submit the same, his bail order will be cancelled and he will be sent to jail again, the bench said.

 Police arrested Partha after Gita Sarkar from Madhyamgram lodged a complaint on May 10, alleging that the jawan, a resident of Nadias Chakdah now posted in Kashmir, had fled with her 18-year-old daughter Sutapa on March 29.

 On March 31, Sutapa returned home and told us that Partha took her forcibly to a house in Calcutta and got physically intimate with her after promising marriage, Gita said in her complaint. 

 She also told the police that after staying with her daughter for two days, Partha refused to marry her.

 Madhyamgram police picked up the jawan from his Chakdah home on the day the complaint was filed.

 Parthas lawyer today told the high court that his client had stayed with Sutapa after marrying her at Kalighat temple. He added that if granted bail, Partha would live with his wife.

 Additional public prosecutor Ashimesh Goswami accused Partha of cheating Sutapa. During her stay with Partha, Sutapa asked him to marry her but he refused. Now he is promising to marry Sutapa only to get the bail, he said.

 After hearing both parties, the bench said: Partha will have to register his marriage with Sutapa. We are giving him three weeks time. He will have to produce his marriage certificate before us in the meantime.

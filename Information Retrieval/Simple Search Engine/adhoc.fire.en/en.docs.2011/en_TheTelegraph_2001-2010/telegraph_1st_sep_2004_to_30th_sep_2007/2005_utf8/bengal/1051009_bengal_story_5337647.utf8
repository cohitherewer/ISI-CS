 Cop push to war on trafficking

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 8: Police have tied up with a non-government organisation to spread the word against girl trafficking in villages of South 24-Parganas, following a spate of such cases.

 From Sunday, the police will throw their weight behind Sonata Foundation for a campaign calling on villagers to ensure that if someone offers to take a girl outside, he should register with the police and give the address of the place where she is being taken.

 Earlier, people would shy away from a police station. But now, villagers have mustered courage to inform the police about girl trafficking. We want to take a step ahead and win their confidence to tackle the menace, said district superintendent of police S.N. Gupta.

 While the foundation will contact puja committees for a 40-minute presentation on how to prevent trafficking and protest against it, some filmstars and director Hara Nath Chakrabarty have been roped in to add a dash of glamour.

 The campaign will cover areas like Sonarpur, Baruipur, Joynagar and Canning in the district ? places most affected by the menace.

 Shobhandeb vs Subrata

 Calcutta, May 11: Mamata Banerjee, who today released the list of Trinamul Congress candidates for the June civic polls, has got Sobhandeb Chattopadhayay to take on mayor Subrata Mukherjee. 

 The Trinamul leader however, ruled out a three-way split of Opposition votes. She dismissed the newly-floated United Democratic Alliance (UDA) as a non-starter and said it would be a straight fight between the ruling Left Front and her party. 

 Those who have floated the UDA are nothing but the CPMs stooges and we dont attribute any importance to them. There will be a complete polarisation of votes between my party and the CPM. 

 Subrata recently broke away from the Trinamul to float the Paschimbanga Unnyan Congress Mancha.

 Out of 141 seats, Mamata will put up candidates in 118 and the rest have been offered to her ally, the BJP.

 Among heavyweights on the Trinamul list are Ajit Panja, former party MP from Calcutta north-west, Partha Chatterjee from Behala (West) and Satgachhia MLA Sonali Guha, apart from Chattopadhayay, the MLA from Rash Behari.

 The party leadership had decided to put up Mamatas confidant Kakali Ghosh Dastidar against the mayor after Chattopadhaya declined to contest. But the MLA had to change his decision when Mamata insisted.

 Chattopadhaya will take on the mayor in ward 87, which falls under his Rash Behari Assembly segment. 

 Ghosh Dastidar, who has unsuccessfully contested two Lok Sabha and one Assembly polls, has been fielded against the outgoing mayor-in-council member, Mala Roy, in ward 88. Roy switched over to the UDA.

 Chatterjee has been pitted against the CPMs mayoral candidate, Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, in ward 100. Panja, who is contesting from ward 63, is expected to head the civic body if the Trinamul-BJP combine is voted to power.

 Six out of 11 mayor-in-council members of the outgoing civic board have been re-nominated in their respective wards. Over 50 per cent of the candidates are new faces.

 All sitting party councillors, except those who have joined the UDA, have been given tickets. Minority candidates have been allotted 15 seats.

 The list was ratified by the partys working committee, which met at Mamatas Kalighat residence this afternoon. 

 The Trinamul leader said her party would not project any one as mayoral candidate before the elections. Our councillors will elect their leader after getting a clear mandate from the electorate, she said. 

 We are confident of retaining the board for the second time since my party councillors worked as a team for the last five years to develop Calcutta and provide its people quality civic amenities, Mamata said. 

 In a veiled attack on the mayor, the Trinamul leader said she would go around the town telling people that no individual can claim credit for good civic performance. It is unfair to blow ones own trumpet.

 A group of Trinamul activists from Entally held a demonstration at Mamatas residence demanding a change of the party nominee in ward 56. Party leaders had a tough time controlling the agitators who shouted slogans for hours.

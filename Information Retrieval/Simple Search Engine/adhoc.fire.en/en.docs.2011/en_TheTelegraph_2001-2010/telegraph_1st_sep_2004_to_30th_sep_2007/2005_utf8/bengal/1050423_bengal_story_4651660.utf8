 Suicide after TV scolding 

 Krishnagar, April 22: A 14-year-old girl who could not resist watching television despite poor performance in school hanged herself last night after a snubbing from her mother.

 Suparna Thakur?s suicide at Kalyani in Nadia, about 50 km from Calcutta, came eight days after Pinky Mondal, a Class III student, drank pesticide at Nakashipara in the same district after being beaten up by her mother for not doing well in her annual exam.

 A student of Kalyani Experimental School, Suparna did not fare well in her exam. ?She was promoted to Class VIII but barely got pass marks in many subjects,? said her father Panchananda, a high school teacher in nearby Kanchrapara.

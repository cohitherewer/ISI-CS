 Chaos breeds in hour of crisis

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Uttarpara, Sept. 16: At 10.30 am, the area around the state general hospital here was as usual ? teeming with cycles, rickshaws, autos, the odd four- wheeler and hundreds heading to Uttarpara station for a train to Howrah. 

 The routine was broken by two taxis ? one following the other ? with two men waving red cloths and yelling move away? hurry? accident? patients to make way through the congestion. A hooter-blaring ambulance followed. 

 In 10 minutes, police had to stop traffic on GT Road to allow smooth entry to the procession of the injured from Bally Halt, around 2 km away. More ambulances, taxis, trucks and matadors.? The rush of bleeding men and women continued for one-and-a-half hours. 

 A man was pronounced dead and four were treated and discharged. Six others died within 15 minutes.

 With the injured pouring in, other patients queuing up and anxious relatives and curious onlookers thronging the place, it was no more the usual commotion, but much worse.

 Superintendent Ranajit Ghosh referred the more serious to Calcutta hospitals without wasting time, but with only one ambulance at his disposal, his hands were tied. Local clubs pitched in. 

 Till then, blood and burnt oil trickled down the bodies of the injured, many of who lay on hospital floors. Some of the men were even being treated in the female wards. 

 Swagata Roy, a Beleghata resident who teaches in a school in Howrahs Salap, was groaning in pain on a stretcher. She boarded the bus at Bally. Before it made it to the next stop, the bus plunged around 40 feet below. Roy was later shifted to a nursing home with a broken shoulder.

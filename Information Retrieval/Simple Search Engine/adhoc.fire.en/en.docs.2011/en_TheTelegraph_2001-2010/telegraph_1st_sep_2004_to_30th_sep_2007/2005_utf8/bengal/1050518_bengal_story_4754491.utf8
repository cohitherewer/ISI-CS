 Ghost bill relief

 Calcutta, May 17: The high court today directed the state electricity board to restore within 48 hours the connection of a Garia resident who was sent several fictitious bills and accused of not paying her dues in time, reports our legal correspondent.

 Bakul Rani Sarkar, a resident of Vivek Park, moved court after the board disconnected her power supply on February 25.

 The local power board office told Sarkar that her bills from 2001 to 2004, amounting to Rs 29,000, were unpaid. On three earlier occasions it had sent fictitious bills. Once I received a bill of Rs 1.28 lakh. On another occasion, I got a bill of Rs 1.29 lakh and then Rs 77,000. When I contacted the zonal officer, he asked the assistant engineer to withdraw all the bills, Sarkar said.

 Then her electricity line was disconnected and she was told that there was the unpaid bill of Rs 29,000. Sarkars son Debabrata had lodged a complaint with the Regent Park police station. The police did nothing, said the petitioner. 

 Justice P.K. Chattopadhyay said: The assistant engineer will have to file an affidavit stating the reasons behind the harassment.... The line will have to be restored within 48 hours.

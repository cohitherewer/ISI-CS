 BRIEFS

 Behrampore, Aug. 14: Police today rescued Asrafan Bibi and Manwara Bibi, the CPM members of Beldanga-II panchayat samiti who were allegedly abducted by Congress supporters. 

 The two were found in lawyer and Congress leader Haroon Rashids house at Shyamnagar, 50 km from Beldanga. The Congress, which had moved a no-confidence motion against the CPM board, had claimed that the two had shifted allegiance. A police officer today said: Asrafan told us they were kidnapped. Four Congress leaders were arrested on charges of kidnapping last Friday after Asrafans hus-band filed a complaint.

 Santiniketan: A woodcutter was held here on Sunday for felling a Sonajhuri tree with the permit to axe a Krishnachura. Visva-Bharati floats tenders for felling trees that are damaged or decaying. Two days ago, Adhir Garai had allegedly felled another Sonajhuri tree. Police said he had links with Akhtar, who was arrested for smuggling a sandalwood tree in March last year.

 Salt Lake boss chosen

 SANJAY MANDAL 

 Majumdar: No. 1

 Calcutta, June 26: Biswajiban Majumdar will be the new chairman of the Bidhannagar municipality, party sources said today.

 In a meeting of the state secretariat last week, the leaders formally decided that the former college teacher would replace Dilip Gupta. The state leadership has informed the district committee about this at an informal meeting, said a senior North 24-Parganas CPM leader. 

 Officially, the district leadership said the name of the chairman would be formally announced in a day or two. The gazette notification on the new municipal board will be issued tomorrow. We will announce the name of the chairman soon after that, Amitabha Basu, the CPMs North 24-Parganas secretary, told The Telegraph today. 

 Party insiders said the state leaders had agreed in principle that Majumdar would become the next chairman ? if he wins the ward in the June 19 polls ? after the meeting at Jyoti Basus house, where it was decided that Dilip Gupta would be removed. 

 Another name was also sent to the state leadership for the chairmans post but the state secretariat has informed the district party that Majumdar would replace Gupta, a CPM leader said. 

 Party sources said Majumdars clean image and acceptability among the upper middle-class as well as non-Bengali residents of Salt Lake gave him an edge over his comrades aspiring for the post.

 He contested from ward 15, form where Gupta was elected councillor on two earlier occasions, and defeated his BJP rival by over 3,500 votes. 

 There was little dispute over Majumdars selection as the chairman but there are complications over picking the possible vice-chairperson and chairman-in-council members. 

 Initially, Ila Nandi, the CPM councillor from ward 23 and wife of Dum Dum MP Amitava Nandi, was being thought of as vice-chairperson, but sources said the clash between the partys state and district leaderships on polling day over police excesses complicated matters. Other names have cropped up meanwhile.

 Alimuddin Street and the chief minister are not happy with Nandi for his comments on the police action and threat to withdraw candidates, a senior leader said. 

 There is also the possibility of offering the vice-chairpersons post to Chumki Bannerjee, the lone CPI councillor in the 23-member board. She won ward 7. Our policy is to offer the post to a front partner, a CPM leader of Salt Lake said. 

 Sources said if Bannerjee does not get the No. 2 slot, she may be included in the chairman-in-council along with Nanda Gopal Bhattacharya, transport minister Subhas Chakrabortys brother-in-law.

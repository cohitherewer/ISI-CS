 Book list stricture for HS schools

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 18: Higher secondary schools will now have to get their book lists approved by the council before they are given out to students.

 The West Bengal Council for Higher Secondary Education?s decision is an apparent bid to prevent the institutions from teaching topics out of the prescribed syllabi. 

 Till last year, the schools had the liberty to select their own textbooks.

 A flurry of complaints from students and guardians about schools following textbooks comprising topics beyond the syllabi prompted the present move. The complaints, officials said, were wide-ranging: 

 Additional topics leading to undue pressure on students

 Important topics being left out; as a result, the students are being unable to cover the entire syllabus

 Topics relevant only to the Joint Entrance Examination to enter engineering and medical colleges also being included, leading students to believe that those topics form part of the higher secondary course

 Publishers increase the prices of the books by unnecessarily making the contents voluminous; the more the number of pages, the higher the price of the book. 

 The decision will come into effect from the 2005-2006 academic session beginning June, said a council official.

 ?Each and every school teaching higher secondary courses will have to strictly follow our syllabi and the textbooks prescribed by us,? said Gopa Dutta, the council president. 

 The council has also decided to prepare a booklet containing the names of its approved textbooks. 

 Every prescribed textbook will also have a particular TB (Textbook) number. Copies of the booklet will be sent to over 7,000 higher secondary schools across the state. 

 The schools will have to draw up their selection from the booklet and then send the list to the council for clearance. 

 The institutions will be allowed to distribute the book lists only after getting an approval from the council. 

 The council president said the first phase of preparation of the booklet is already complete and work for the second one is under progress. 

 Till last year, the council had no system of numbering the textbooks and the publishers and authors only had to take its permission for printing them. ?Irregularities in the books often lead to confusion among students,? said Dutta. 

 An official admitted that some textbooks now in circulation burden students unnecessarily. Besides, many who follow below-par books learn less and are also inconvenienced during examinations.

 Prithwis Basu, president of the West Bengal Headmasters? Association said it is a step in the right direction. ?Under the old system, prices of many HS textbooks were high as their volume was unnecessarily increased by the publishers.?

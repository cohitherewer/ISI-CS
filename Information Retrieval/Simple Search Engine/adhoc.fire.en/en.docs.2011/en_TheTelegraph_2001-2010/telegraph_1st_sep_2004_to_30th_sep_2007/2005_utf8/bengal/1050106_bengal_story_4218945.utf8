 Power struggle with DVC

 ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE

 Durgapur, Jan. 5: The state government is planning an attractive package for power supply to entrepreneurs willing to set up industries, especially in Durgapur and its adjoining areas in Burdwan. 

 The reason behind this is the stiff competition from Damodar Valley Corporation, a central power utility. 

 Officials said that in Durgapur new investors are being attracted by the lower tariff of close to Rs 3 per unit offered by the DVC, while the power supplied by the state electricity board (SEB) costs around Rs 5 per unit on average. Also, the SEB cannot fix its own tariff as the State Electricity Regulatory Commission (SERC) is the sole arbiter on fixing of tariffs. 

 Power minister Mrinal Banerjee today said discussions were on with the commerce and industries department on how to check the uneven competition. 

 ?Our officers have taken up the matter with their counterparts in the industry department. We need to offer an attractive incentive package to industrialists who are interested in setting up units in the Durgapur industrial belt and take power supply from SEB,? he said.

 ?We hope to bring out a formula. We have discussed the possibility of charging lower rates than what has been set by the SERC, with the industries department filling the gap by paying us the difference.? Banerjee said a final decision on whether the industries department would be paying a subsidy is yet to be taken.

 Commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen is not averse to the idea of a lower rate for bulk consumers. ?We have also discussed whether we can pay to the SEB the difference in tariff that has been fixed by the SERC...? he said.

 Explaining the tariff gap, DVC officials said their tariff for bulk consumers has been unchanged since 2000. As the DVC has operations in Bengal and Jharkhand, it is yet to be ascertained which regulatory commission will control the power utility. Once this is sorted out, the power tariff for industries in Durgapur may not as cheap as it is now, a DVC official said.

 The SEB has also petitioned the SERC to bring down the tariff for bulk consumers.

 Varsity gives shape to Vivekanandas vision

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 2: Swami Vivekandas vision is set to become a reality.

 The spiritual impact that has come to Belur (Math) will last 1,500 years, and it will be a great university. Do not think I imagine it. I see it. he had said in 1902.

 More than a century later, the Ramakrishna Math and Mission is fulfilling its founders dream. 

 The Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Education and Research Institute (Deemed University) at Belur Math, Howrah, will open its doors on Monday. 

 It will be inaugurated by Union human resource development minister Arjun Singh. Although the central administrative office will be located at Belur Math ? the Mission headquarters ? classes will be held across the country.

 At present, the courses offered will be taught at various branches of the Ramakrishna Mission, an official said. However, at a later date, a separate university building will be set up in Belur.

 Swami Atmapriyananda, vice-chancellor of the institution, said: The type of university Swami Vivekananda had envisioned was a subject of debate among his followers over the decades. But what is being set up is a deemed university with a difference. It is not going to be the same as those already existing. 

 Apart from the countrywide campus, the courses on offer will make it a university with a difference. 

 The varsity will focus on teaching disability management, integrated rural development, including tribal development, Indian spiritual and cultural heritage and value education and disaster management, including relief and rehabilitation.

 According to officials in the state higher education department, the deemed university has been set up under Section 3 of the University Grants Commission Act, 1956. This has added more prestige to the university as this section allows only institutions or organisations with exceptional contribution to society to set up a deemed university, an official said.

 The Centre, after getting the nod from the UGC, had issued the notification on setting up the university in the Union government gazette in January this year.

 The vice-chancellor said that keeping in mind the educational system envisioned by Swami Vivekananda, the university intends to stress on building life and character.

 Besides the unconventional subjects, the university will teach courses on emerging areas such as biotechnology, nano-science, nano-technology, informatics, microbiology, information and communication science and technology.

 Among the fundamental sciences, theoretical physics, pure mathematics and theoretical computer science will be offered.

 The university will, however, not receive financial assistance either from the state or the central government.

 BRIEFS

 Midnapore, March 3: Dharani Mahato, a suspected Naxalite, was held in Belpahari today with 49 gelatine sticks on him.

 Last Saturday, the chief minister was on the Naxalite turf in West Midnapore, calling the rebels to return to mainstream. District police chief Ajay Nanda said the sticks are used to explode landmines and ?we have reasons to believe that the Naxalites were planning an assault on the police?. Inspector general, law and order, Chayan Mukherjee said in Calcutta: ?Mahato?s links with the Naxalite outfits are known.? An intelligence team has left the city for the seizure site.

 Calcutta: A middle-aged man, later identified as Murari Mohan Adhikari, was found with his throat slit in a hotel in the New Market police station area on Thursday evening. Adhikari was rushed to SSKM Hospital, where he underwent surgery and was said to be stable. Police said he was wanted in a fraud case at Singur in Hooghly.

 Siliguri: The weekly auction at Siliguri Tea Auction Centre was stalled for the second week amid protests from buyers who demanded that proxy bidders take responsibility for a tax evasion scam. The commercial tax directorate recently unearthed evasion of crores by tea traders for post-auction sale.

 Shalishi meet called to save minors future

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Krishnagar, Oct. 5: Police today registered a case against a Class VI student for allegedly raping a seven-year-old girl a fortnight ago in the Krishnagunj police station area, about 110 km from Calcutta.

 We have initiated the case on the basis of a complaint from the girls father, said the Nadia superintendent of police, R. Rajasekharan. The superintendent said neighbouring police stations have also been directed to conduct raids in search of the boy.

 However, medical report confirming the rape of the girl ? a student of Class I in a school at Krishnagunj ? is yet to reach police. The victim was first taken to the Krishnagunj block health centre and from there shifted to the Saktinagar hospital.

 Police learnt of the rape after the girl complained of abdominal pain at a shalishi meeting convened during the day to settle the matter. The girls father then lodged a complaint with Krishnagunj police. 

 Investigators wondered about the delay in lodging a complaint with police. How could the parents sit on the incident, which took place a fortnight ago? asked a police official.

 Netai Sardar, 14, accosted the girl in the afternoon of September 16 when she was coming home from school, according to the police. The boy lured the girl to a relatives house in the locality and allegedly raped her there.

 An elderly neighbour, who had seen Netai taking the girl to his relatives residence, later told the girls mother.

 I saw my daughter crying in pain and took her home. Later, we told some village elders who suggested that we settle the matter amicably and not inform the police as it involves the future of two minors, she said.

 Police said shalishi meetings were arranged by village elders thrice and it was decided that the boys parents would hand over Rs 40,000 as compensation to the girl. Todays meet was crucial as the boys father was supposed to hand over the money to the victims parents, said a village elder.

 However, everything changed when the girl fell ill at todays shalishi meet. We feared trouble and suggested that the victims parents lodge a complaint with the police, said local CPM leader Lakkhi Sardar, a member of the Taldaha gram panchayat.

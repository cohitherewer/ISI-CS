 To Delhi with Salim shield

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bhattacharjee: Armed

 Calcutta, Aug. 31: The state CPM leadership will walk into tomorrows central committee meeting in Delhi armed with an elaborate defence of Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees industrialisation initiative with investment from Indonesia.

 The chief ministers efforts to get the Salim Group to invest in South 24-Parganas during his recent trip to Jakarta have sparked a debate among Left Front constituents on economic policy.

 Generally speaking, the representatives from Bengal on the CPM central committee and the politburo are expected to support the Bhattacharjee initiative, a state CPM functionary said today. But one cannot rule out a critical line emanating from the Citu brigade on the two panels. 

 The three-day meet will start on Friday.

 State CPM officials today said the leaders would take along a note that explains in detail the circumstances that led the government to scout for investments abroad. The note also spells out the state party units position, the prevailing socio-economic conditions, compulsions for the party and Bhattacharjees shrinking options. 

 Citu general secretary Chittabrata Majumdar and president M.K. Pandhe ? both members of the central committee and the politburo ? are known to be under pressure from the unions rank and file for not raising their voices against the Bhattacharjee governments bias towards building shopping malls, housing complexes and townships that do not generate high employment opportunities.

 To counter resistance from any section, the Bengal CPMs note is also packed with information on jobs that the proposed ventures will throw up and the safety net in place for the farmers who have to be displaced for the execution of the projects.

 Once the state leaders are back from the capital, Bhattacharjees initiatives will come up for discussions at bipartite meetings with the Forward Bloc and the RSP, CPM state secretary Anil Biswas said today.

 The meetings are expected to be convened on September 5 and 6 in the city. There will also be a Left Front meeting later.

 Reacting to leader of Opposition Pankaj Banerjees demand that an emergency Assembly session be called to discuss the Salim Group project, Biswas said: The issue does not demand taking any such immediate measure.

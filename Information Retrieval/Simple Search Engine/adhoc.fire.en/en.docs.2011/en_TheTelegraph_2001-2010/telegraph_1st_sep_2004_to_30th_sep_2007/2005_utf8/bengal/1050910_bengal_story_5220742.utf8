 CPM fuels Bloc feud

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Behrampore, Sept. 9: Under fire from the ally in Calcutta over the governments pro-industry policies, the CPM is trying to make use of feuds within the Forward Bloc in Murshidabad to strengthen its grip there and, possibly, settle scores.

 Since the split in the district Bloc unit following the expulsion of former minister Chhaya Ghosh and former MP Jayanta Roy, the district CPM leadership has been secretly maintaining ties with the duo to keep the official Bloc leadership headed by Ashok Ghosh under pressure.

 A district CPM leader said: Our leadership is not pleased with the Bloc, which has openly opposed the land reforms bill and joined hands with the Trinamul Congress to stall it.

 The Bloc has differed with the CPM on key issues and criticised the Left Front, which is barred by a code of conduct, said CPM district secretary and district front chairman Nripen Chowdhury. 

 The murder of the district Bloc president, Sampad Das, on August 31 handed the CPM an opportunity to consolidate its position. Das had taken over Roys post after his ouster. As one Bloc faction lodged an FIR alleging that the supporters of Ghosh and Roy were involved in the murder, district CPM functionaries assured help to the rebels. The intention ? to widen the split in the ally.

 Das had been accused of having assets disproportionate to his income as had been Bibhas Chakraborty, who replaced Ghosh as Bloc secretary.

 Ashok Ghosh, the Bloc state secretary, and Anil Biswas, his CPM counterpart, declined comment on the controversy.

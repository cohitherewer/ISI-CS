 Plan to ease teacher hiring norm 

 - Training clause to be put on hold

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Nadia, Dec. 11: Alarmed over an acute shortage of teachers in state-aided primary schools, the government is planning to temporarily withdraw a two-year-old policy which makes it mandatory for primary teachers to obtain teachers training degrees before joining.

 Most of the aspirants for the teaching posts do not have the teachers junior basic training degree. Officials say the government is planning to relax the norm to attract more applicants, making it easier to fill up vacancies.

 In 2003, the state government announced that primary school teachers must get their teachers training degrees before joining. Only 50 per cent of teachers of a primary school were required to have the degree before the announcement was made.

 As a result of the shortage, the teacher-student ratio has gone down in many districts like Nadia, Howrah and some north Bengal districts. In Nadia, there is only one teacher for about 65 students whereas the ideal teacher-student ratio should be 1:40. This has led to tremendous pressure on the existing number of teachers. The chief minister has repeatedly emphasised the need to improve the primary education sector and engage more teachers.

 School education department officials said there are not enough number of institutes in Bengal from where candidates can get teachers training degrees, which has led to the lack of trained hands. There are around 135 primary teachers training institutes in the state with enrolment capacities between 80 and 125.

 Justifying the move to relax the norm, the officials said nearly 45,000 of the 1.75 lakh teaching posts are lying vacant. What has aggravated the problem is a recent decision of the government to create 10,000 more teaching posts.

 The 135-odd training institutes will be able to produce nearly 16,000 trained candidates though we are in immediate need of at least 55,000 candidates having passed the teachers training course, said Sulapani Bhattacharya, president of the West Bengal Board of Primary Education.

 The shortage has worsened with the closure of over a dozen training institutes following an order by Calcutta High Court.

 The court ordered the closure after a section of private institutes, which were denied affiliation by the government, moved court against the government, complaining that some institutes had been granted affiliation despite lack of proper infrastructure.

 Teachers bodies said the governments decision to make the degree mandatory was at the root of the problem. The government should have introduced the rule after ensuring that there were enough institutes to produce a large number of trained teachers, said Kartick Saha, general secretary, Bengal Primary Teachers Association.

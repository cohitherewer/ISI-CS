 Kidnap 7 set free

 Calcutta, Nov. 29: All seven accused in the kidnap and murder of Mullickbazar trader Jayparakash Gupta were acquitted today for want of evidence. 

 The magistrate of the fast-track sessions court said the detective department, which has been handling the case for six years, had failed to submit any strong evidence against them. 

 Police presented 23 witnesses, including Guptas relatives, but most of them turned hostile. We will move high court and file a petition, said Ganesh Maity, the public prosecutor.

 Gupta was abducted on November 12, 1999. The next day, his family started receiving ransom calls. They agreed to pay Rs 3.8 lakh, said a police officer. But the family also lodged a complaint with the police and the case was handed over to detective department. 

 The abductors told Guptas family to come with the money on November 14 to a spot in central Calcutta, the officer said. As soon as the abductors came, the police gave a chase and arrested Abhijit Halder. The rest fled without the money.

 During Halders interrogation, the police came to know the whereabouts of his associates. The investigators called up one of the abductors on November 14 and asked him to release Gupta, an officer said. On November 15, Guptas body was found in a pond in Belghoria. The post-mortem confirmed that he was murdered a few hours after Halder was arrested.

 The Guptas accused the police of bungling. They believed he would have come back fine had they not called the police.

 Six others, including Raju Nayek whose name figures in police records as an extortionist, were arrested later.

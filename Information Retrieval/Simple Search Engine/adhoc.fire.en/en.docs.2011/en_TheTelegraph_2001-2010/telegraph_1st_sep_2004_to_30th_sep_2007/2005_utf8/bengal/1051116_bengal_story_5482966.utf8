 BRIEFS

 Calcutta, Nov. 15: The government has initiated a move to transfer Maoist leaders lodged in jail to different addresses in the wake of the Jehanabad strike. 

 The move follows information from Patna that the extremists who raided the Jehanabad jail on Sunday night had left behind posters saying that the torture and detention of two of their leaders in Bengal was one of the reasons behind the strike. 

 CPI (Maoist) leaders Sushil Roy and Patit Pawan Halder, who were arrested in Calcutta in May and are lodged in Midnapore Central Jail with 17 other Maoists, are believed to be the leaders the rebels referred to. They are key leaders from their action squad. Talks are on to transfer them to a jail in Calcutta, said a senior police officer. Rebels who have stayed for over five months in one jail will also be shifted.

 Sources said jails secretary P.K. Agrawal has already ordered a mass transfer of Maoist leaders lodged in the states six high-security jails. Mohan Baidya from Nepal, another action squad leader who is now in the Jalpaiguri district jail, might be brought to Midnapore. 

 Calcutta: The secondary education board has published textbooks in Braille for Classes IX and X. They can be collected from Narendrapur Ramakrishna Mission. 

 Bankura: Mamata Banerjee said her party will forge poll pacts with like-minded parties before next years Assembly elections. She was addressing a rally at Jhilimili in Bankura, about 320 km from Calcutta.

 College turns into war zone

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, Sept. 3: SFI and Chhatra Parishad supporters fought a pitched battle for more than four hours at Katwa College this morning, forcing police to fire three rounds to disperse the warring students.

 At least 10 students were injured in the clash at the institution, about 160 km from Calcutta. College authorities suspended classes indefinitely.

 The trouble started yesterday when SFI members allegedly assaulted Sheikh Hafizul, a first-year BA student, for not attending a conference at Rabindra Bhavan in Katwa town. Hafizul lodged a complaint with college principal Debaprasad Samanta.

 SFI members again tried to assault Hafizul when the college reopened around 11 am today. Members of the Chhatra Parishad, which controls the students union, protested and a clash erupted.

 Members of the two groups threw stones at each other, turning the college campus into a battlefield for more than four hours. The students ransacked the common room and broke furniture. Three motorcycles were damaged. Two bombs were also hurled.

 DFID pat on Buddha back 

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, Feb. 10: The Bengal government and Britain?s Department for International Development (DFID) began their annual dialogue today by taking stock of the projects in progress and discussing the programme for the coming year. 

 A six-member team headed by DFID?s acting country head, Howard Taylor, met 10 secretaries to review the DFID-funded projects in Bengal, like the Calcutta urban services for the poor, Calcutta environment improvement project, district primary education programme and the pilot project of restructuring 18 loss-making PSUs. 

 After the meeting chaired by chief secretary Ashok Gupta, the British funding agency expressed satisfaction at the state?s performance. 

 The government today proposed that DFID take up a project for development of the Sundarbans by improving basic services on the islands, living conditions of the people and income generation. 

 DFID has communicated its approval of a proposed project for decentralisation of the panchayat system. The panchayat and rural development department had sent a Rs 900-crore plan for strengthening the panchayat system through capacity building of panchayats, improvement of their accounting system and planning process. 

 The agency will conduct a study on good governance in the state taking into account public finance management, decentralisation and e-governance. Another study on restructuring five state transport undertakings is being done. 

 DFID is also sponsoring a study on small industries and labour issues. 

 The health department placed a Rs 100-crore proposal for upgrade of health units in backward districts, including some in north Bengal.

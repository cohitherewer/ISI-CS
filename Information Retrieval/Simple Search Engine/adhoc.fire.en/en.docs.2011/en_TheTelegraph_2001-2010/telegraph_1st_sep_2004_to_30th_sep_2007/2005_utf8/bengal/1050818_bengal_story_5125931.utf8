 Panic strikes in city

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Aug. 17: Ashraful Biswas desperately tried to get in touch with his family in Dhaka today, but failed. So did Zia-ul Haq, whose family cannot be traced. 

 Bangladeshi families in the city today slowly woke up to the tragedy across the border. Within hours of receiving news of the serial blasts, they tried to contact their loved ones. But only a few managed to speak to them. 

 There was palpable panic in the departure area of the city airports international terminal after an unidentified suitcase was found lying there. 

 We immediately brought our bomb disposal squad into the frame and they evacuated people from the area and found that a passenger had simply forgotten to pick it up, CISF commandant Sanjay Prakash said.

 At the Calcutta Travels ticketing office, Osman Goni and his family were shocked. Fifty-six blasts! I had no idea. My elder daughter is studying medicine in Dhaka. I will call her as soon as I can to check. How awful! I am going to Chennai tomorrow for treatment, he said, before requesting an official to turn on the TV so he could watch the news.

 A Bangladeshi family waiting at the Marquis Street ticketing office of Raj Travels and Tours for tickets on the bus to Bangladesh tomorrow had good news. You are lucky. All three buses for tomorrow are sold out. These were the last tickets, Syed Irshad of Raj Travels said.

 Abu Yusuf Choudhory had come to Calcutta for medical treatment. Scheduled to leave for home tomorrow, he is glad to go back to his family. 

 Holidaymaker Zia-ul Haq, staying at the Gulshan Palace Hotel, said: I heard about the blasts. Im not from Dhaka, but I have family there. I have tried to call Dhaka, but havent been able to get through.

 Also at the same hotel are Razia Mirza and Shehnaz Parveen Chowdhury, who are on their annual vacation to India. We are scheduled to return by bus tomorrow. We have watched news of the blast on the TV. We will ring our families at night and check the situation and then finalise our plans.

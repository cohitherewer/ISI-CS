 Pranab faces party fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 27: A torrent of fiery rhetoric marked a meeting of the state Congress today as party leaders sat down to chalk out plans for tomorrows campaign in support of Behrampore MP Adhir Chowdhury. 

 But after three hours of splitting hairs, there was no schedule in sight. 

 The Congress has been threatening to hold protest rallies in Behrampore since Chowdhurys arrest last week in connection with a double murder.

 However, most senior leaders ? including Pranab Mukherjee, Somen Mitra, Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and Pradip Bhattacharya ? cried off tomorrows campaign. 

 Mukherjee, the Union defence minister, and Das Munshi, the parliamentary affairs minister, cited the must-attend winter session in Delhi, while Mitra said he has to go for a medical check-up. 

 The leaders decided to organise a march to Writers Buildings in the first week of January.

 As Mukherjee stepped out of the state Congress headquarters after the meeting, angry party supporters pounced on him. 

 We have to eschew our differences and work together for Adhir, a victim of political conspiracy, as well as the Congress in Bengal, Mukherjee told them. He had mouthed the same line at the meeting. 

 At Burrabazar, another group of protesters, demanding the scalp of Atish Sinha, the leader of the Congress legislature party, awaited him. 

 There is no question of ousting anyone, because an ouster is not going to serve our purpose, he told nearly 200 party workers, who stopped his car around 3.15 pm.

 A former mentor of Chowdury, Sinha has been facing flak because of his comments against the arrested MP. However, Mukherjee later told reporters he would consider taking action against Sinha.

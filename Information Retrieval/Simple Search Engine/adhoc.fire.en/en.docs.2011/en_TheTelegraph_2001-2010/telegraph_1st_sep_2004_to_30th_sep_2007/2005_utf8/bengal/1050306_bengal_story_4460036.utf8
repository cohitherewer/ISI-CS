 Jhawar suspect ready to talk

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 5: Mukesh, who was driving the Maruti Omni in which Arvind Bhai, an accused in the Roma Jhawar kidnap case, was murdered a month ago, has agreed to give a confessional statement to the magistrate. 

 The sub-divisional judicial magistrate?s court will record his statement on Monday and has asked the Dum Dum jail authorities, where Mukesh is lodged, to keep him in a separate cell till then.

 Two others ? Guddu and Munna ? held in connection with the abduction of Roma (in picture above) near her Salt Lake home on February 4 have refused to give any statement. 

 The duo has been remanded in judicial custody till March 19 by sub-divisional judicial magistrate, Alipore, Manjit Singh.

 Guddu, who owns the Kadapara garage where Roma was kept hostage in a taxi, and Munna, who was guarding it, were arrested by the Criminal Investigation Department within 48 hours of Roma?s return a day after she was kidnapped. However, police failed to trace Mukesh till he surrendered at Entally police station a few days ago. 

 Last Tuesday, the police found three countrymade pistols and a revolver in a bag lying close to a blind lane. Sleuths claimed that one of the arms had been used for Arvind?s murder, allegedly planned by Gunjan Ghosh, the brain behind the kidnap. 

 ?Had they (Guddu and Munna) given their statement, it would have been easier for us to prove Gunjan?s guilt in the murder of Arvind,? a CID official said.

 While filing Guddu?s bail plea, his lawyer Subrata Sanyal said his client had no idea about the murder. 

 ?The CID officials have failed to trace Arvind?s family members. They forced the accused to identify the body. Apart from the accused, no one came forward to identify the body. And it puts a question mark on whether the deceased was Arvind or not,? Sanyal pointed out. 

 ?Guddu used to run the garage, which was very popular in the locality, and he was no way involved in the incident,? he added.

 After going through the seizure list submitted by the CID, magistrate Singh rejected Guddu and Munna?s bail plea and remanded them in judicial custody.

 The CID, however, is still clueless about the whereabouts of Pappu Yadav, who allegedly pulled the trigger on Arvind.

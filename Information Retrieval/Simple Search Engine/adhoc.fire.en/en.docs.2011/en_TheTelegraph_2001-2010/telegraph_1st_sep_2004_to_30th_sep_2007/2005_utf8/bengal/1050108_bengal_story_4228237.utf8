 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, Jan. 7: A woman was allegedly molested and her polio-afflicted daughter assaulted by a senior medical officer of the railways at his clinic in Ranaghat, 65 km from Calcutta, on New Year?s eve. 

 The 30-year-old woman had refused to pay Dr Sanjit Chakraborty Rs 500 that he demanded for a medical certificate for claiming an annual financial assistance for her teenaged daughter. The doctor is absconding.

 Krishnagar: Farha Bibi, 18, was allegedly burnt to death by her husband and his mother at Sutragar in Shantipur, 70 km from Calcutta, because her cooking skills did not meet their standards. Police arrested Farha?s mother-in-law after her father lodged a complaint. Her husband is at large.

 Calcutta: The government has transferred five IAS officers, including tourism secretary A.K. Patnaik and the secretary of the excise department, T.K. Barman.

 ?Bigamy? blow to judge

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, May 4: A senior judge has been asked to step down after he was accused of attempting to marry a second time without disclosing or dissolving the first relationship, judicial officials said. 

 The chief justice of Calcutta High Court advised Subir Guha, the chief judge of the city civil and sessions? court, to resign, according to the officials. Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar was not available for comment.

 But an official associated with efforts to contain the damage arising from the controversy said: ?We have reasons to believe Subir Guha met the chief justice in the wake of reports that his first wife has written to the government as well as the chief justice. She has pointed out that Guha has concealed his first marriage while making a formal move to marry for a second time.? 

 ?After hearing him, we believe the chief justice advised Guha to consider stepping aside for safeguarding the honour of the judiciary,? said a senior member of the state judicial services? association.

 A former secretary of the state judicial department, Guha, 58, found himself at the centre of a storm after his wife Anubha, a former college teacher once posted in Agartala, complained to the chief justice, the law department and the marriage registrar concerned that Guha was close to committing bigamy.

 ?We are not very sure the family wants to talk about the sordid episode,? said a woman at Guha?s official residence at Salt Lake, declining to identify herself. Several messages left for Guha went unanswered.

 ?If true, the reports against Guha, I must say, are very unfortunate,? said law minister Nishith Adhikary. ?But I don?t want to talk about it at this point because the Guha episode directly concerns the chief justice who supervises all subordinate judges.? 

 In mid-April, Guha allegedly made a declaration before marriage registrar Mousami Ghatak, stating he had married 35-year-old Aparna Bandopadhyay in 1995 and wanted to formally register the union.

 The marriage registrar has sent notices to both Guha and Anubha, asking them to appear before her.

 According to the complaint, Anubha married Guha in 1974, and the couple has two children, a son and a daughter. In his notice to the registrar, Guha has made no mention of this marriage.

 Since Anubha was based in Agartala where she taught in a college, she would visit the city only on vacations. Guha stayed at his Salt Lake residence with his daughter.

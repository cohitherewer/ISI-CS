 BSF sniffs bigger Bangla threat

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Krishnagar, March 30: The director-general of the Border Security Force, R.S. Mooshahary, today said Indian insurgent groups are getting ?something more? than mere sanctuary in Bangladesh.

 He, however, refused to elaborate on what he meant by ?more?.

 Mooshahary said some of the camps belonging to Indian groups in Bangladesh were in the hinterland while the rest were near the border. 

 The BSF officer declined to name any militant group or disclose the number of camps. He said they were mostly from the Northeast.

 Mooshahary, who today visited Nadia and North 24-Parganas for the first time after assuming office last month, said the sanctuary issue as well as trafficking of humans and weapons across the border would figure in a meeting with his Bangladeshi counterpart in April.

 He told reporters in Calcutta that infiltration across the 4,097-km border has lessened over the years because of stricter vigil.

 Referring to the barb-wire fencing along the border, Mooshahary said the Bangladesh Rifles has raised a few objections. ?According to the India-Bangladesh border agreement of 1975, there should not be any movement of defence items within 150 yards of the India-Bangladesh border. Barb-wire fencing is not a defence activity, but still Bangladesh is opposing our fencing programme at certain places.? 

 However, the BSF officer added, border management has become easier since the fence came into being. 

 About 50 per cent of the land area and one-third of the riverine border are yet to be fenced, he said. 

 Mooshahary pointed out some vulnerable points on the border. ?Those are mostly in the riverine areas in south Bengal from where we get the maximum complaints of infiltration.? 

 Earlier, speaking to reporters in Krishnagar in Nadia district, Mooshahary said the BSF?s plans to investigate criminal cases on the border have been shelved for the time being.

 Asked about repeated BSF excesses on residents of border areas, Mooshahary said: ?Whenever there is a complaint of misbehaviour against BSF personnel, we try them, and if found guilty, they are punished. We have a well-defined internal investigation machinery.?

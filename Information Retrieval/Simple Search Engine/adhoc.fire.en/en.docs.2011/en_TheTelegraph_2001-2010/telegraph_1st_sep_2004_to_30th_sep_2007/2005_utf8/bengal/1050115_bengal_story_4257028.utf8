 Uncertain wait: A mother outside BC Roy hospital

 Calcutta, Jan. 14: The high court today expressed dismay at reports that many state-run healthcare institutions like BC Roy Memorial Hospital for Children work without generators.

 The absence of generators, which rendered incubators useless, had killed four newborns at the highest referral hospital for children in the state on September 27.

 In its interim order, a division bench of acting chief justice Altamas Kabir and Justice Asit Bishi asked the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government to make immediate arrangements for the installation of generators in hospitals.

 ?It is a serious issue, they (the government) must take steps immediately. Generators must be installed in the government-run hospitals,? the court said.

 The bench issued the directive on a public interest litigation filed by members of the All India Minority Forum, who alleged that the hospital authorities were responsible for the baby deaths. 

 The petitioners demanded damages for the bereaved families. Their lawyers, Idris Ali and Sreemoyee Mitra, told the court that they had evidence to prove that not only generators, dereliction of duty by doctors and hospital employees was also a cause of the deaths. ?There are several other reasons? Absence of life-saving drugs, primary vaccines, accommodation in the hospital?s emergency department?? 

 They pointed out that 13 infants, admitted to the hospital for treatment, had died in a span of 36 hours in 2003 ?because of negligence?.

 Government pleader Rabilal Moitra claimed that the petition was not maintainable as none of the petitioners was affected by the mishap. He added that the government had done much for the hospital since then.

 The 2003 deaths had landed the health administration in a major controversy. The chief minister had to step in to shield health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra, who was under Opposition fire. Bhattacharjee also visited the hospital with the promise of proper treatment.

 Today, the division bench asked Moitra to file an affidavit in three weeks stating the government?s stand on the charges against it and to get the generators going.

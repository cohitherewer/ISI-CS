 BRIEFS

 Krishnagar, May 21: The ailment of a daily wage labourer has left doctors of the state-run Karimpore hospital clueless, as maggots have been coming out from his nostrils and mouth for the last three days.

 Dukhiram Haldar, 45, of Nandanpur village in Karimpore, about 190 km from Calcutta, had been suffering from acute headache for the past week. About a hundred white maggots ? each about half-an-inch long ? have been coming out of his nose and mouth along with blood.

 Doctors in the hospital said they havent come across such a case in the recent past but diagnosed it as myiasis, a disease in which a type of fly (chrysomia), is attracted to infections, specially in the nose, and lays about 200 eggs at a time. 

 Within 24 hours, the larvae start coming out of the nose and mouth, said ENT expert Anirban Biswas. Cleaning the infected area with chloroform and treating the patient with antibiotics are the only options left.

 Haldar is being shifted to Saktinagar Hospital in Krishnagar.

 Calcutta: Left trade unions have withdrawn the 48-hour nationwide strike scheduled from May 31 following the Centres assurance that the Electricity Act, 2003, would be amended and their demand for continuation of cross subsidy in the power sector would be considered. The unions had called the strike to oppose the Centres move to privatise state electricity boards in the country, which the government assured to reconsider.

 Midnapore: Fifteen fishermen were rescued on Saturday night after their trawler capsized near the coastal belt of Digha around 9 pm. Police said they were trying to trace one missing fisherman. The fishermen, coming from Kakdwip in South 24 Parganas, were rescued by a trawler of the Digha Fishermen and Fish Industry Association.

 Calcutta: The prison directorate has asked superintendents of 54 jails across Bengal to identify prisoners who have completed 70 years of age in confinement. A senior jail official said ailing prisoners above 70 would be released.

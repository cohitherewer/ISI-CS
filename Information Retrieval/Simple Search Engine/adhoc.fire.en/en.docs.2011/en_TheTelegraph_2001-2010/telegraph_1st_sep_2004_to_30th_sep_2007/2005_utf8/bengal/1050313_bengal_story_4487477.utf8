 ...Relieve city

 Calcutta, March 12: Yesterday?s Nor?wester brought respite with the day temperatures dropping as a result, but left a worry over the weather during the Eden Test beginning Wednesday. 

 The maximum temperature recorded today was 23.9 degrees Celsius, 10 degrees below the normal. The maximum yesterday was 30.6 degrees. Till this evening, there was 26.1 mm of rainfall in 24 hours. K.K. Chakraborty, the chief of the regional meteorological centre at Alipore, said there might be thundershowers tomorrow. But the effect of a low-pressure trough and westerly winds that resulted in the shower would gradually subside. 

 It is too early to comment on the weather during the India-Pakistan Test, Chakraborty added.

 The low-pressure trough stretched from eastern Uttar Pradesh to north of Bay of Bengal across Bihar, Bengal and Bangladesh. A deep trough of westerly winds lay along central India in a north-south direction between 5 to 9 km above sea level. 

 Today, Calcuttans were not complaining, despite waterlogging in pockets. The weather remained pleasant throughout and the ?water receded very quickly because the showers were not continuous?, said an officer at the city police traffic control.

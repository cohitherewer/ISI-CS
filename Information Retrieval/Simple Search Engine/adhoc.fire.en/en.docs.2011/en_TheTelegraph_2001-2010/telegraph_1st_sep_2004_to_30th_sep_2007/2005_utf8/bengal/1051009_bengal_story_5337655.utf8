 Calcutta, Oct. 8: Calcuttans who wish to flock to the Maidan to watch the 10-headed Ravan turn to ashes are in for a disappointment this year.

 The army, in accordance with a Calcutta High Court order, has denied the organisers permission to hold the festival this year.

 An annual event since the 1930s, Dussehra on the Maidan has been an integral part of the festival season.

 Officials of Punjabee Bradree, who organise the Dussehra in the citys lungs, said that while police gave their permission, the army refused to give the nod to the festivities off Park Street. 

 We received the negative reply so late that we were left with virtually no time to find out another suitable site, said Kapil Kumar Katyal, the president of the Bradree, which has been organising the event since 1972.

 In accordance with the high court order that bars any activity that can damage the sanctity of the Maidan, we denied the organisation permission to hold the festival, said D. Ghosh, the deputy general officer commanding and station commander of the army in Calcutta. 

 He added that the army had nothing against the festival and the decision to bar the Bradree was taken in view of the court order.

 During the festivities, which start around 3 pm and continue up to 8, the Ramayana is staged and giant effigies of Ravan, his son Meghnad and brother Kumbhakarna are burnt in its climax.

 About 1.5 lakh people witness the triumph of good over evil on the Maidan every year, Katyal said. They would be deprived of an opportunity to celebrate this time.

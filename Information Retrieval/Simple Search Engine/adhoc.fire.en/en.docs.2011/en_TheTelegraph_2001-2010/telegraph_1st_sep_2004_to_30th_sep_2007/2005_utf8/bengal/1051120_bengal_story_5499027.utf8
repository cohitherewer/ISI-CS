 School beating

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Chinsurah Nov. 19: Saumalya Baral, a Class IX student of Naity High School in Hooghly, was hospitalised yesterday after a teacher allegedly beat him.

 Doctors of Chanditala Rural Hospital, about 35 km from Calcutta, released the 15-year-old at night and advised to get a brain scan done.

 Police have begun a probe following a complaint by Saumalyas father Susanta against teacher Dipali Pal and headmaster Kartic Chandra Guchait. 

 Pal, a history teacher, had seen Saumalya talking to a classmate and asked the students to keep quiet as Madhyamik students were taking a pre-test in another room, the police said.

 I was adjusting my spectacles. But Dipali aunty thought I was making faces at her and started beating me, said Saumalya, who stood first in his Class VIII finals. My glasses were broken and blood was coming out from my ears.

 He sought Guchaits permission to go home but was refused. Some of his friends informed his mother, who took the boy home. 

 The boy may have been thrashed. But some people are trying to make it an issue to harass Pal and me, Guchait said.

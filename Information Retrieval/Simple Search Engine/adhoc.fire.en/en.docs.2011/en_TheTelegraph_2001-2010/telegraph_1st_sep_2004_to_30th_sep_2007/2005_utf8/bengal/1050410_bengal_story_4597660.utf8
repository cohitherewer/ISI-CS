 ?Trafficker? kidnap

 - Who?s 

the criminal? 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 9: A man who allegedly led dozens of innocent girls through a maze of dingy lanes to an uncertain future went through the ordeal himself till police rescued him and took him into custody.

 Pratap Mondal, who the police said could be a girl-trafficker, was picked from Sealdah last night. The kidnappers used a woman, said to be close to him, as bait to fetch him to the city from a place called Durgapur, in South 24-Parganas. 

 This morning, they telephoned a relative saying Pratap was in hospital and his mother should call up immediately.

 Ambika Mondal, who called her son on his cellphone, was told he had been kidnapped and Rs 1 lakh had to be delivered at College Street to secure his release. ?I turned up with my daughter at Muchipara police station,? she said. 

 Based on her information, the police set up a trap. As two youths walked up to collect the money from Pratap?s sister Kajal, plainclothesmen rounded them up. The duo led the police to Sraddhananda Park where four others were arrested and Pratap was rescued. Three daggers and a six-chamber revolver were recovered from an abandoned room of a dilapidated building where he was housed for about 15 hours.

 A search is on for the woman, said to be from Barasat in North 24-Parganas, used to lure Pratap to the city. The police said she asked him to see her last evening at a place off Chhobi Ghar, a cinema in Sealdah. 

 Pratap was taken away at gun-point within moments of his arrival. 

 ?They made me walk through narrow lanes and dark alleys and took me to a room at Sraddhananda Park. They beat me for money, took away Rs 200 I had on me and demanded a lakh. I said it was not possible,? said Pratap, his swollen face bearing proof of his torture. 

 Ajay Kumar, deputy commissioner of police, central, claimed it was ?one the fastest operations? conducted by the force. The gang, he added, ?was desperate to make quick money and confined Pratap to a room at gun-point?. 

 The plot to kidnap Pratap was chalked out after one of his friends, Kamal Sardar alias Brijesh, of Sonarpur, turned back on him and joined hands with gangsters in the Sealdah area.

 Kumar said the kidnappers told the police they were aware that Pratap was engaged in girl trafficking. ?So, he was targeted. They knew Pratap would not only cough up the money but also refrain from complaining to the police.?

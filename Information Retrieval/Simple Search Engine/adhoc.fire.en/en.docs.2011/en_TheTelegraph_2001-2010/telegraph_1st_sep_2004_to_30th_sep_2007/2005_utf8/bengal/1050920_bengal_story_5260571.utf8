 Front allies ready repartee to CM note

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 19: The CPI, RSP and the Forward Bloc are finalising their respective notes to be sent to Left Front chairman Biman Bose by Wednesday seeking information from Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on the proposed projects of the Salim Group.

 The three constituents of the coalition today said they have raised important questions on the chief ministers note distributed by the front chief a fortnight ago. 

 They had missed the deadline fixed by Bose to send their notes by September 18.

 The partners of the ruling coalition, who had earlier decided to submit their opinions in writing, later changed their decision as they felt that Bhattacharjees note lacked details of the proposed industries.

 Bose has decided to convene a Left Front meeting by the month-end after getting the partners opinions. It is likely that the second round of talks among the front partners will begin shortly.

 We know nothing about the Salim Group projects as the note given to us lacks details. We want to know the land involved in the projects and the exact number of farmers or others who will lose their lands. We also want to know how many people will get jobs in the projects. Will they get permanent employment or temporary jobs? What kind of units is the Salim Group planning? asked CPI state secretary Manju Kumar Majumder.

 The CPI leadership, which met in Delhi on September 17 and 18, had approved the points raised by the state unit of the party regarding the projects.

 CPM state secretary and politburo member Anil Biswas said the party has told front partners that the government will try to avoid taking over farm lands. But if we have to acquire farm lands, the government will certainly compensate those who lose their lands. I feel our partners will buy our argument.

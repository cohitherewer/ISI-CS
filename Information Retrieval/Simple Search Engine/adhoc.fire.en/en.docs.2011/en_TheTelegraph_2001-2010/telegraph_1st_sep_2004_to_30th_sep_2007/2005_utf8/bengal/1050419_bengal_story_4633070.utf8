 Blood stock dries up 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Midnapore, April 18: An acute scarcity of blood has hit West Midnapore. 

 The district authorities said the number of blood donation camps has dwindled with the onset of summer compounding the situation.

 Chief medical officer Mangobinda Mondal, said police and youth organisations have been alerted and asked to organise blood donation camps. ?We face this problem every summer but this year it appears more acute,? he said.

 At Midnapore Medical College and Hospital, there were only two pouches of A- blood yesterday. At Kharagpur State General Hospital there was no blood at all and at Jhargram Subdivisional Hospital there were 13 pouches. 

 However, the authorities said the stocks were higher today as the appeals for donation camps bore some fruit.

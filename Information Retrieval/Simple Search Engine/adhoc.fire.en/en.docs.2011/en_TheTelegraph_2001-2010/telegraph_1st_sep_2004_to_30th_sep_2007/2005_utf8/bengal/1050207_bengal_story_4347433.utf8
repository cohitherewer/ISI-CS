 Erosion onus on Centre 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Swathes of land devoured by the Ganga

 Malda, Feb. 6: It is official now. The Union water resources ministry will from now on be responsible for fighting erosion caused by the Ganga and the Phulhar in Malda and Murshidabad, instead of the state irrigation department.

 Talking to The Telegraph here today, irrigation minister Ganesh Mondol said the state government?s decision to accept the proposal put forward by Union water resources minister Priya Ranjan Das Munshi ? to bring erosion control under Delhi?s wings ? has been conveyed to the ministry.

 ?On February 2, the state irrigation secretary conveyed to the Union water resources secretary that the Centre was free to undertake erosion control measures from Jalangi in Murshidabad to Bhaluka in Malda,? said Mondol.

 With this, two divisions of the state irrigation department will also be winded up. These are the Ganga division in Malda, which employs around 250 engineers and employees, and the Padma division that has a staff strength of 200. These employees will now be deployed in other divisions.

 Only the Mahananda division ? where 200 people work ? is being retained as it does not fall in the area being transferred to the Union ministry. 

 ?We had been facing problems while tackling the river erosion. There is the funds problem, as a result of which we cannot carry out important work. Then, when we finish a project, we are blamed needlessly,? Mondol said.

 The decision to do away with the two divisions, the minister said, would also prove beneficial. ?With a freeze in employment, there is currently a 40 per cent shortfall in the number of engineers required. We will re-deploy the engineers of these two divisions in other projects like the Teesta, where posts are vacant,? the minister said.

 The irrigation department will now concentrate on the damage done by rivers like the Mahananda and the Kalindi. 

 The minister added: ?We would also like to see how serious the Centre is about the erosion caused by the Ganga and the Padma.? Asked about the water resources ministry?s request for irrigation department engineers to work on deputation, Mondol said: ?We cannot let go of engineers. We are only sparing the executive engineer of the Mahananda division, Sandip Dutta.?

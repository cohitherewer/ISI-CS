 Police storm meeting of Mao youths

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 17: A police team barged into a small room in a house on Muraripukur Road this morning in the middle of a news conference organised by the CPI (Maoist)s youth and student wings.

 Personnel from the Manicktala police station questioned leaders and members of the Revolutionary Youth League and the Revolutionary Students Federation on a range of subjects ? from the full name of the organisations to their politics and policies.

 Shaken up by the strikes in Bankura and Purulia last Saturday in which three CPM leaders and an officer were killed, the police have decided to put all CPI (Maoist) wings under the scanner. 

 Officials from the Special Branch ? the intelligence wing of the city police ? have been deployed in the Manicktala area. They will keep an eye on the CPI (Maoist) sympathisers and their activities. 

 The police have even set up a picket in front of the place where the media interaction had been organised.

 Elaborating on what led the police in Calcutta to become active in tracking down the Maoists movement, an officer said: In the July 9 attack at Dulukdihi in Purulia, two youths from Calcutta and its adjoining areas were in the action squad. We have identified them as Kamal and Akash. Besides, a few days before the twin strikes by the Maoists, three members of their greater Calcutta committee ? Sabyasachi Goswami, Kanika Debnath and Dipanjan Mukherjee ? were arrested from the city.

 Sources said four members hold the key to the outfits activities in the region. 

 Prasanta Bose left his house in Jadavpur 20 years ago and has been staying in the jungles of Jharkhand. Another member, 55-year-old Pareshda from Sonarpur, looks after the organisation in Assam, said a police officer. 

 In Chhattisgarh, Sahebda from Bansdroni is in charge. A Howrah resident, Kanchanda, looks after the organisation in Jharkhand. All four were earlier attached to the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC). 

 The Peoples War and the MCC merged last year to form the CPI (Maoist).

 Talking to the media this morning, Sukumar Kayal, the state secretary of the Revolutionary Youth League (RYL), said his outfit supported the CPI (Maoist) policy. 

 The CPM is our only Opposition and organisations like the RYL and the RSF (the students federation) are the forces that can remove the CPM from the state, he said. Those arrested from Calcutta recently have no link with the incidents in Bankura, Purulia and Midnapore. The police have booked them under false charges.

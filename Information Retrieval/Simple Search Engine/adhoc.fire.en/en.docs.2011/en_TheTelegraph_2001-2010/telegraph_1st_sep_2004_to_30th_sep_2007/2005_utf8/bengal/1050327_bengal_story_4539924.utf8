 Buddha sermon to workers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 26: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today urged the working class to increase productivity to develop the state?s industrial units.

 ?You (the working class) will benefit once your factory can make profit and you have to keep this in mind,? Bhattacharjee told a gathering at Bishnupur in South 24-Parganas this morning. 

 Inaugurating a new plant of a plywood manufacturing unit, the chief minister said good relations between workers and owners would attract more investors to the state and help the government solve the unemployment problem.

 At Bakkhali in South 24-Parganas, where the chief minister inaugurated a workshop on tsunami-control this morning, he said the Planning Commission has sanctioned Rs 100 crore for the development of the Sunderbans. ?We will get the money soon,? Bhattacharjee added.

 ?The deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, Montek Singh Aluwaliah, has agreed to sanction the fund to our government after our officers have convinced him of the necessity to develop the delta.? 

 The chief minister was accompanied by Sunderbans development minister Kanti Ganguly and local MPs Sujan Chakraborty and Basudeb Burman.

 Bhattacharjee said the Centre has also agreed to assist his government in constructing a bridge over the Hatania-Doania river, which will help boost direct trade with Bangladesh. 

 He added that his government is busy drafting a development plan for the Sunderbans, where about 40 lakh people live in 19 blocks.

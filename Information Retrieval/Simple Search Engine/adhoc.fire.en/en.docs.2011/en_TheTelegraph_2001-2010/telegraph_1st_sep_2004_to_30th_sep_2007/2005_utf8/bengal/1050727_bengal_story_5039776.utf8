 Doctors under scanner

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Burdwan, July 26: A section of doctors in the district is under probe for issuing doubtful birth certificates.

 Thirty doctors, some of them homeopaths, have already been served showcause notices. District magistrate Subrata Gupta said the doctors concerned ? mostly from the Burdwan, Durgapur, Memari and Katwa municipal areas ? are being summoned for questioning. If we are not satisfied with their explanations, we will initiate legal action against them and seek the intervention of the state medical council, he added.

 The doctors are being interviewed individually by the district authorities. The municipalities and the administration receive many applications for delayed birth registrations. According to the rule, an inquiry must be conducted at the administrative level before an official birth certificate is issued, said additional district magistrate Debashish Basu, who has questioned over a dozen doctors.

 A general physician of Durgapur had certified in his pad that a woman had given birth to her son under his treatment on April 4, 1996. But his letterhead carried a seven-digit telephone number beginning with 2, which the BSNL introduced only in 2003.

 A homeopath of Mangalkot had issued a birth certificate on January 1, 2005, claiming he had handled a case on April 4, 1973, when a woman gave birth to a daughter. 

 How can a homeopath certify a birth 32 years ago? a district official asked.

 Parents should apply for a birth certificate at the local civic body or panchayat within three weeks of childbirth with hospital and medical documents. In rural areas, where childbirths often take place at home, with the help of midwives, parents have to inform panchayats or local health workers. In case of a birth at home under the supervision of a doctor, his or her certificate is also accepted by the local panchayat or municipality, which issues the official birth certificate.

 The Indian Medical Association said it would not try to protect the doctors if they are found guilty. We will help the administrations if they deserve punishment. But the administration has to prove the doctors guilt beyond doubt, said Rupak Dutta, a member of the IMA executive committee in Burdwan.

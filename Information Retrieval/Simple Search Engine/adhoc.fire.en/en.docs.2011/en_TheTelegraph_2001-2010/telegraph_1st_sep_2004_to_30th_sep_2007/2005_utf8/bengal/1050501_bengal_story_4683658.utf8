 Mask off Banka killer

 A STAFF REPORTER 

 Calcutta, April 30: Police have identified the murderer of the Bankas of Camac Street but failed to hunt him out of his hideout. 

 A treacherous terrain, dense forests and policemen who would not dare to venture out after sunset were some of the hurdles that stood in the way of a city police team that went to Bihar to trace the domestic help who bludgeoned to death 68-year-old Tara Chand Banka and his wife Sarda on the morning of April 18.

 Two teams had fanned out across Jharkhand and Bihar looking for the man identified as Kebol Roy.

 While one returned late last night, the other has not given up.

 ?After combing at least eight villages under Katoria police station in Bihar for days, we have come to know that the domestic help is neither Pancham nor Mahesh, but Kebol Roy,? an official said. 

 ?The eldest among three brothers, Kebol hails from Khejuria village under Katoria police station. A day after murdering the couple, he returned to the village,? he added. 

 A section of senior police officials expressed regret that despite his mask being ripped off, Kebol, who had gained entry into the Banka household under a false identity, had managed to give them a slip. 

 They blamed villagers for refusing to cooperate. Instead, they would pass on information to Kebol everytime the police raided the village, the officials claimed.

 With an uncooperative local police, no electricity and roads dotted with potholes, the job became even more difficult. 

 ?The local police would simply refuse to go out without adequate force. Even then, we raided Khejuria on more than one occasion. But the moment villagers saw a police jeep cut through the dark from a distance, they would pass on the information. And if someone walked into the forest, there was no way one could fish him out,? said an official attached to the detective department of the city police. 

 ?The day before (the murder), Kebol had learnt that the Bankas had withdrawn a large amount from the bank to attend a wedding?. He first killed Tara Chand and then his wife before opening the almirah to take the money. Kebol also took away two bracelets of Sarda, each costing around Rs 25 lakh,? said an official.

 The police tracked down the numbers of two mobile phones Kebol had stolen and learnt that he had taken a train to Josidih. Later, he bought a charger from Deogarh but did not use the sets after that.

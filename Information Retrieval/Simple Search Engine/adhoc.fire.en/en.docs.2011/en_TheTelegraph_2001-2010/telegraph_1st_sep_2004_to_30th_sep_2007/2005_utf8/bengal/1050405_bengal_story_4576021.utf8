 Boy death under wheels triggers free-for-all amp; firing

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Behrampore, April 4: About 2,000 villagers fought police and ransacked and set fire to a house and a sweet shop after four-year-old Sohail Sheikh was crushed under a truck in Raghunathgunj this morning.

 The owner of the house at Sammatinagar, 260 km from Calcutta, where the truck driver took shelter to escape the mob, fired from his gun, injuring Sohail?s uncle Akbar. The police said the bullet grazed his head. Over a dozen villagers and two policemen were injured in the melee.

 Tamal Das has been arrested and his licensed gun seized. The truck driver, however, managed to escape through a back door. 

 Sohail was accompanying his father Sahabul Sheikh and his mother to a wedding. ?They were walking down the Jangipur-Lalgola road when the truck laden with earth hit the boy, killing him on the spot,? a police officer said.

 The driver tried to flee with the truck but villagers, attracted by the screams of Sohail?s parents, rushed in from all corners and blocked its path. The driver ran into Das?s house, about 30 metres away, with the villagers hot on his trail.

 They asked Das to hand over the driver, but he refused. The mob first poured its anger on an adjacent sweet shop. The sweets, soft drinks and cash were looted. Chairs inside the shop were set on fire. Then the gate in front of Das?s two-storey house was smashed. The mob stormed the house armed with flaming chairs from the shop. 

 His double-barrel gun in hand, Das warned the villagers from his first-floor balcony, but they were in no mood to listen. Brickbats were hurled at him and newspapers were used to spread the sweet shop fire. Das shot at the mob twice. 

 Half a dozen policemen arrived from the Raghunathgunj police station, but they proved no match. Then came subdivisional police officer Arindam Dutta Chowdhury with a large force. The mob attacked the contingent with brickbats and other missiles. The officer was hit even as a lathicharge ensued. 

 Murshidabad superintendent of police Sanjay Singh said the rampage continued for about two hours. ?We are yet to arrest anyone from the mob, but raids are on.?

 Grumbles greet CM

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Egra, Oct. 28: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today ticked off irrigation officials in East Midnapore after hearing complaints against them for turning deaf to demands of local people and the administration. 

 The chief minister arrived here by road this morning to assess the flood situation. After visiting relief camps at Khejuri, Contai and Egra, he met legislators from the district. 

 At the Egra community hall, about 200 km from Calcutta, many of them complained about the dismal performance of the irrigation officials. 

 East Midnapore was the worst hit by the recent floods in south Bengal with about 20 lakh people affected. 

 Left leaders told Bhattacharjee that irrigation officers had ignored their complaints regarding breaches in embankments. Patashpur MLA and former water resources minister Kamakhya Nandan Das Mahapatra also pointed fingers at jails minister Biswanath Chowdhury, who is now overseeing irrigation. The government, Bhattacharjee promised, would release Rs 3.5 crore for embankment repairs.

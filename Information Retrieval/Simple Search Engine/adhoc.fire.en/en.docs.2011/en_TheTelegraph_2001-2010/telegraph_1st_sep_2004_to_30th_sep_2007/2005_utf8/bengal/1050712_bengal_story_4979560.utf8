 CM frowns on police network

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, July 11: The chief minister today expressed his displeasure over lack of intelligence regarding the Maoist strike on CPM supporters and the subsequent death of the police officer. 

 At a meeting with senior officials at Writers Buildings this morning, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wanted to know why police did not have information about the extremists infiltration into the Bankura and Purulia villages. Security in the districts had been tightened in the wake of a spurt in rebel activities. 

 Intelligence branch (IB) additional director-general Sujit Sarkar and inspector-general Sandhi Mukherjee were left red-faced as they struggled to explain their network failure. 

 Chief secretary A.K. Deb, home secretary P.R. Ray and director-general of police S.C. Avasthy were also present at the meeting. 

 Delhi has been informed about the developments, said an official.

 Asked to comment on the outcome of his talks, the chief minister declined comment. Parliamentary affairs minister Probodh Sinha later said he would place a report on Saturdays killings in the Assembly ? on July 14. 

 Avasthy, who had yesterday visited the affected areas, submitted a report to the chief minister on his return. A fresh team of officials was also despatched during the day to help the administration of the two districts. 

 After the meeting, the home secretary admitted that there was lack of intelligence in connection with Saturdays attack and the explosion that followed. Though 29 companies of policemen are stationed there, we did not get any prior information about extremists sneaking into Mejhgeria village of Bankura on Saturday evening and into Dulukdihi village of Purulia, he said. 

 Deb suggested that Prabal Sengupta, the officer-in-charge of the Barikul police station, should not have opened the black leather-and-canvas bag that blew up in his face. 

 It is sad that Sengupta got killed. Had he been careful, the mishap would not have taken place. Policemen have been trained in how to deal with bags or other such things lying around, he said.

 The states top bureaucrat did not rule out the involvement of local people in the attacks. We have information that the extremists involved in Saturdays killings have a strong base at Kankrajhor in neighbouring Jharkhand. 

 Police there are being contacted for joint raids.

 Govt to blame, says minister

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta/Midnapore, July 12: A minister today hit out at the government for failing to carry out development work among the poor in Bankura, Purulia and the Midnapores, where poverty was proving fodder for rebellion. 

 The minister for tribal affairs, Upen Kisku, told a public meeting at Bijaharpur in Panskura, about 70 km from Calcutta, that Maoists have spread their tentacles among the tribal people as we have not been able to provide irrigation facilities and electricity to them. 

 Poor people are aggrieved having been denied basic irrigation facilities and electricity and the Maoists are taking advantage of it, he added. 

 In Calcutta, state CPM secretary Anil Biswas also admitted this afternoon that there were under-developed areas in Bankura, Purulia and East and West Midnapore ? the districts Kisku had mentioned earlier in the day.

 The Maoists are misguiding a section of youths in the poverty-stricken areas, cashing in on the lack of development, he told a news conference at the partys Alimuddin Street headquarters. 

 Biswas ruled out the possibility of holding talks with the Maoists as they have taken the path of violence and are killing our men. 

 The rebels have no ideology, he said. According to the CPM leader, Maoism has become obsolete even in China. But in our country, some forces are misguiding the youths in the name of a distorted theory of Maoism.

 He also refuted the allegation that the CPM activists, killed by the Maoists were police informers. Why should our members work for the police? Biswas asked. He scoffed at suggestions that the attacks were a result of feud between the Naxalites and party supporters working for them.

 About 3,000 police and paramilitary personnel today continued to search the forests of Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore for extremists.

 Inspector-general (western range) Anil Kumar, deputy inspector-general (Midnapore range) Gangeswar Singh and West Midnapore police chief Ajay Nand held a meeting in the Belpahari police station, about 80 km from Dulukdihi, to review the situation in the wake of the spurt in extremist activities.

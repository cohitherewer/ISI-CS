 Calcutta, Nov. 12: Panic gripped passengers of a tram when they saw smoke billowing out of the first-class compartment after an electrical component caught fire this afternoon. 

 The tram ? No. 217 ? was on its way to Shyambazar from Dharmatala, when it developed an electrical snag at the Bidhan Sarani and Vivekananda Road crossing around 1.15.

 Suddenly smoke filled the first-class and the drivers compartments of the tram ferrying around 60 passengers. 

 It was a scene of utter chaos. People were fighting one another to get out of the tram. The inside of the first-class compartment was filled with smoke, said Kalyan Haldar, the owner of an electrical goods shop near the crossing.

 No one was injured in the melee.

 Haldar said the driver and conductors of the tram rushed to a nearby house where masons engaged in renovation work brought sand to douse the fire. 

 Passers-by crowded around the tram and the traffic police had to drive them off the road.

 The joint box caught fire because of an electrical fault. Later, the tram was towed away to our Shyambazar depot, said L.C. Ghosh, the transport superintendent of Calcutta Tramways Companys (CTC) Belgachhia depot. 

 A CTC official said fire in a trams joint box, which is attached between the two compartments near the wheel and supplies electricity to the motor from the overhead wires, is not uncommon. Especially if the tram is old, the joint box develops frequent electrical snags. It works as a fuse system and prevents passengers from getting electrocuted in case of an electrical short circuit.

 He said that in such cases, the joint box needs to be replaced. 

 Traffic on the busy Vivekananda Road-Bidhan Sarani crossing came to a standstill as seven trams queued up behind the one that caught fire. It took more than an hour to clear the mess.

 Ghisingh?s Germany tour off 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Darjeeling, March 2: Subash Ghisingh has called off his trip to Germany, deciding instead to convene an emergent general council meeting aimed at ending the uncertainty over the hill council?s future.

 The DGHC chief was slated to attend the annual International Tourism Exchange Fair at Messe Berlin ? the city?s main trade show venue ? from March 11 to 15. 

 ?There is no talk of him (Ghisingh) going to Germany,? D.T. Tamlong, the principal secretary of the DGHC, said today. 

 He declined to spell out the reasons that led to the change of plans, but confirmed the general council meeting would be held at Darjeeling?s Tourist Lodge on March 5. 

 The main agenda is to chart a future course for the council, whose extended tenure will end on March 25. 

 A cloud has been cast on the autonomous body after a standoff between Ghisingh and the government over elections to the council.

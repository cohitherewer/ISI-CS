 Bidi to books amp; super success

 NARESH JANA

 Midnapore, June 9: From the lap of poverty has emerged an HS star, a doctor-to-be.

 When Sandeep Chandra finished Class VI, his father decided he had had enough of school. Nirmal had himself studied till Class IX and he thought Sandip would do better helping his mother bind bidis.

 Sandeep has scored 993 in HS and ranked 13 on the JEE merit list for MBBS aspirants.

 Six years ago, Nirmal would much rather spend the money on daughter Tinkus education ? it would help him find a good groom. There was not much else he could do. The resident of Anandapur in West Midnapores Keshpur, about 150 km from Calcutta, earned Rs 750 a month giving tuition to little boys. His wife Anjali earned about Rs 20 a day at a bidi manufacturing unit.

 When Nirmal asked his son to stop going to school, he thought he would put him in his wifes bidi factory. But Chittaranjan De, his English teacher at Teghari High School, where he studied till Madhyamik, would not listen. 

 He proved right. How could we lose such a brilliant student? We told Sandips father we will help him provide for his education, De said today.

 Sandeep had learnt how to roll bidis and still helps me out on off days. I can make 750 bidis a day. With his help I can roll 1,000, his mother said.

 But in the season of rejoicing, Nirmal is again in a quandary. My daughter has passed Madhyamik but I have not been able to marry her off. How can I dream of providing Rs 2,000 every month for my sons MBBS? Nirmal broke down.

 After Madhyamik, De got Sandeep admitted to Godapiashal M.M. High School, 12 km from his village. Biology teacher Rabindranath Saha guided me in science. Chitta sir arranged free guidance from other teachers in Midnapore town, Sandeep said. He travelled 25 km for the help everyday. 

 At 5 am, he took a bus to the town, then attended school and visited teachers for another round of tuition before reaching home at 11 pm. 

 The bus operators came to know of him. De said: We had put in our collective effort. More needs to be done.

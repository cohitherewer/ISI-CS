 Mistrust to murder, suicide

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 9: Enraged by his wife?s suspected extra-marital affair, a resident of Krishnapur in North 24-Parganas, on the fringes of the city, killed her and committed suicide.

 Bibhas Pramanik, 24, of Rajbanshi Para in Rajarhat, strangled Soma, 20, in their bedroom when all other members of his family were asleep last night. Soma was three months pregnant

 Pramanik, a guard attached to a private security agency in Salt Lake?s Sector V, then slashed his wrists and throat with a shaving blade in a desperate bid to end his life. When the process proved ineffective, he tried to hang himself from the ceiling fan, but in vain as his feet touched the bed. 

 He then hanged himself from the ceiling fan in the adjacent dining room, a district police official said.

 Dharmadas Pramanik, who runs a grocery shop in his house, came to know about the tragedy when he went to open it around 6 this morning. 

 Having found the door of the dining space leading to his shop closed from inside, he called out his sons Subhas and Bibhas, who live in two adjoining rooms facing the dining space. 

 Coming out of his room, Subhas found his brother hanging from the fan. In the room, he found Soma lying lifeless on the floor. 

 He started screaming and neighbours came running. Police removed the bodies and sent them for post-mortem. 

 Soma?s mother lodged a complaint with the police saying her daughter was murdered. ?Preliminary investigation suggests the husband strangulated the wife and later killed himself. We have lodged a case of murder,? said Praveen Kumar, the North 24-Parganas superintendent of police. 

 A senior police officer said suspicion that his wife had an extra-marital affair led to the murder. ?We are yet to know why he ended his own life in such a bizarre way,? he added. 

 Mana Mandal alleged that her daughter was being pestered regularly by her husband. ?He suspected my daughter of having an affair. My daughter, an introvert, was very unhappy,? she said. 

 The mother said Bibhas and her daughter had a relationship since she was in the local Chanchal Kumari School. ?Nine months ago, they got married. I was against it all through, but had to accept,? she said, sobbing. 

 According to both the Pramaniks and Mandals, Bibhas?s suspicion grew when Soma conceived. ?She was three months pregnant. Bibhas was asking for an abortion, which Soma had refused. His family stood by her,? said Mandal. 

 Neighbours said Bibhas picked fights with his wife at the slightest provocation.

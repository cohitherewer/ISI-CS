 Another fish harbour 

 Calcutta, March 1: The state is set to have its sixth fish harbour at Petuaghat in East Midnapore.

 Fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda today said the nod from the Union finance ministry reached his department yesterday. 

 Four fish harbours are in operation at present ? two at Sankarpur near Digha and one each at Frasergunj and Diamond Harbour. The fifth is coming up at Kakdwip, South 24-Parganas. It will have a jetty, boat repairing yard, provisions for packaging, a fuel station, cold-storage and ice-plant. 

 The Rs 32-crore project, funded equally by the state and the Centre, is scheduled to be completed by 2008, though the government aims to finish the job by 2007. 

 Nanda said the state is keen to boost fish export from its present value of Rs 600 crore a year.

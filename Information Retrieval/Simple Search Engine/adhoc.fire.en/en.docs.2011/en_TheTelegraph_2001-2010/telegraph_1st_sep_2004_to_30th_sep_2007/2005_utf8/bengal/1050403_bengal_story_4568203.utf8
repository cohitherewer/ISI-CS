 Govt to buy time on eviction

 OUR LEGAL REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 2: With an eye on the elections to over 80 civic bodies slated for May and June, the government is planning to move a fresh petition before the Supreme Court seeking more time to carry out its order on the eviction of 25,000 settlers along Rabindra Sarovar.

 A day after it was hauled up by Calcutta High Court for having failed to carry out the eviction of the settlers on March 2, the government, officials said, has no alternative but to approach the apex court to avoid further embarrassment. 

 ?Our counsel will tell the whole story. The government is sure that an effort to evict the settlers will claim several lives as an encounter is inevitable if such a move is undertaken,? said a home official. 

 The state will get the opportunity to approach the apex court on April 4, when a petition filed by Ekata, an organisation of the squatters, would come up for hearing before a division bench. In the petition, the organisation demanded that the eviction should not be carried out without proper identification of illegal settlers.

 Sukehndu Sekhar Roy, an advocate for Ekata, who had left Mamata Banerjee?s Trinamul Congress to join the Congress, said he switched over ?only to save the squatters from forceful eviction?. He also claimed that senior Congress leaders had promised him that they would pressure the Centre to ensure alternative arrangements for the squatters.

 The settlers are also hopeful. ?We hope the government would not use bulldozers against us and, instead, find out an alternative accommodation,? said an elderly member of the Gobindapur Sangram Committee. Ratan De, its secretary, said: ?We are happy that railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav has announced that there would be no fresh move to evict the squatters till the government allots substitute land.?

 Yesterday, a division bench of Chief Justice V.S. Sirpurkar and Justice A.K. Ganguly rapped the government for its failure to follow the apex court?s directive. It also asked city police chief Prasun Mukherjee to file an affidavit saying when he would get the settlers evicted.

 Lawyers representing the railways today said the state had requested Laloo Prasad to side with it in the apex court.

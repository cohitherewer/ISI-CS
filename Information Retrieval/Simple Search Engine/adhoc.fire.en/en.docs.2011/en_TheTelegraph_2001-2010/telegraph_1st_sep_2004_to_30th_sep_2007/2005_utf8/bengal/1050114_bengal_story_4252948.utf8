 Cops in Academy greenroom

 Calcutta, Jan. 13: Police stormed the Academy of Fine Arts greenroom at the end of a play tonight in search of an actor accused of cheating and rape.

 The joint raid, by Regent Park and Hastings police stations, drew a blank as the actor was not present.

 Debesh Chatterjee, the director of the play, Patharu, accused the policemen of posting themselves in the wings and walking on to the stage even as the curtains fell. ?They displaced the props and rushed to the greenroom, where women were changing. One of them shoved me aside?? he said.

 Chatterjee has lodged a complaint with the Hastings police station.

 Anuj Sharma, the deputy commissioner, south division, said: ?My officers raided the place to arrest an actor accused of cheating and rape. I have ordered a probe into what Chatterjee has complained about.?

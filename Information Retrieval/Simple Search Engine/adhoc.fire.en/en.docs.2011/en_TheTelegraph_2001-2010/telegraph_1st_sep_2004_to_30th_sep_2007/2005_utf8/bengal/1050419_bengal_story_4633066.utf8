 Trinamul stops work

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Durgapur, April 18: Supporters of the Trinamul Congress?s trade union wing today prevented resumption of construction of a factory in the Durgapur-Faridpur industrial zone.

 After no work for a month because of opposition to recruitment policies by unions backed by Trinamul, the CPM and the Congress, the company engaged labourers from a list of below-poverty line people provided by the administration to break the deadlock. 

 When the construction resumed, about 230 km from Calcutta, the Trinamul union staged a demonstration and threatened the project supervisers with dire consequences if it continued. Ten mid-sized units were coming up in the zone till work was forced shut.

 Meet over progress report

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 21: The government today reviewed the progress of work on more than a dozen proposed railway overbridges and underpasses.

 Railway overbridges would be given even more attention and the government intends to allocate more funds for them, public works department minister Amar Chowdhury said at Writers Buildings. 

 He met the general managers of Eastern Railway and South Eastern Railway to review the ongoing and proposed projects.

 Observers said the move was an effort to turn public opinion in favour of the government before next years Assembly polls.

 After the meeting, Chow-dhury said: We reviewed progress of work at Barasat, Madhyamgram and Birati among other places.

 Along with overbridges, underpasses are also being planned there to ease congestion, the minister added.

 An underpass is also necessary in Jadavpur, where an overbridge has already been built, the minister said. This has not yet been finalised?. We are working on the possibility of having underpasses for the benefit of commuters in busy and congested areas where the vehicular traffic is being handled by railway over-bridges. 

 Work on overbridges at Dankuni, Barrackpore and Baruipur is expected start this financial year. The one at Kamarkundu in Hooghly is expected to start in the next. 

 Four overbridge projects in East and West Midnapore ? at Rangamati, Balichowk, Jhargram and Purigate ? are expected to be kicked off in two to four months. 

 Some difference of opinion with the railway authorities had apparently prevented work on the Ranaghat overbridge in Nadia from progressing, Chowdhury said, expressing hope that the differences would be set aside and the work would begin in a few weeks.

 An official said it takes time to get started with a railway overbridge or underpass project because of difficulties in acquiring land and relocation of underground utilities.

 Audit bodies to get a boost

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 6: The government today introduced three bills in the Rajya Sabha to amend the acts relating to chartered accountants, cost accountants and company secretaries. The amendments are aimed at more transparency in the functioning of the bodies governing these professions while giving them more autonomy.

 The bills give the institutions powers to take punitive measures against members guilty of professional misconduct and are expected to usher in more stringent norms for corporate governance.

 Minister of state for company affairs Prem Chand Gupta introduced the bills after incorporating the recommendations made by a group of ministers (GoM).

 These bills, which were earlier introduced in 2003, were referred to the GoM after the parliamentary standing committee on finance suggested major amendments.

 The new bills provide for disciplinary committees of bodies running the three professions to try both minor and major misconducts and debar members for up to six years.

 Another amendment increases the fine on unqualified individuals signing accounts from Rs 1000 to Rs 1 lakh. If an individual commits the same offence a second time, the fine will be Rs 2 lakh and imprisonment. The amendments come in the wake of the securities scam of 2001 and also the Global Trust Bank (GTB) crash, where auditors had misrepresented the financial statement of the beleaguered bank.

 The bills also make it clear, as recommended by the GoM, that prior approval of the government for creation of any posts by the respective councils (CS, CA and ICWA) is not necessary.

 This puts at rest fears about the erosion of autonomy of the institutes because of government interference in routine operational and academic matters. Besides, it has been made clear that the government will have the power to direct dissolution of the ICAI council only in case of persistent default in compliance with guidelines, which have been laid down.

 The proposed amendments in bills are also aimed at removing certain provisions of the three acts. The existing provision of prohibiting a university from imparting courses in chartered accountancy will not be disturbed as the GoM has termed it appropriate.

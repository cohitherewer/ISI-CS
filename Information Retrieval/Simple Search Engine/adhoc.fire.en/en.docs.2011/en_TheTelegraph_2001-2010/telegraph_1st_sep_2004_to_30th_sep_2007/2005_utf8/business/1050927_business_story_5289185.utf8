 Training for independent directors favoured

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: Corporate mavens favour an induction programme for independent directors before they join the boards of companies.

 Independent directors should work in a few companies at a time and an induction programme must be held for them before taking them on the board to understand business and risks, said Pramod Bhasin, president, GE Capital India, at a seminar on Series on Governance recently organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 Each independent director could be given the responsibility to understand one aspect of the company such as human resources, sales, marketing or purchases, he added.

 Speaking on corporate governance, Bhasin said, Liability factors make it difficult to get good independent directors as they can face criminal charges for certain decisions.

 The more independent the director, the less the person is likely to understand the business of the company, he added.

 Talking about independent directors pay-packages, he said they must be compensated well as they would shoulder huge responsibilities.

 How independent a director is depends on who signs the cheque or who has appointed the person on the board. But outside evaluators should assess their performance, Bhasin said.

 External evaluators could help implement good governance through programmes organised for committees and individual directors. Their assessments should be conducted in the absence of the management to ensure independence, he said.

 Emphasising that an independent director should not be a customer or buyer of the company, he said such directors need to hold executive meetings without the managements presence.

 In the beginning, the CEO of a company may feel that his or her authority is being encroached, but some balancing act should be done without crossing the line into managements responsibilities, Bhasin said.

 There is now a greater scrutiny following the accounting fallacies in Enron, Tyco, WorldCom and AIG. Besides, shareholders have also started demanding highest standards of governance from their board.

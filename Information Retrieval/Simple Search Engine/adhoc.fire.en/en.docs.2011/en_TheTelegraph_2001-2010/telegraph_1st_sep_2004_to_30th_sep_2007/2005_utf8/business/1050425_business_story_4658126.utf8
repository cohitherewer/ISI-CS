 Petronas, IOC seek nod for LPG exports 

 New Delhi, April 24 (PTI): Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Petronas of Malaysia have sought government permission to export LPG to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

 Indianoil Petronas Pvt Ltd (IPPL), a 50:50 joint venture between IOC and Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas), wants to export LPG to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh from Haldia, a senior official said.

 ?We have been receiving enquiries from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka for purchase of LPG. We, therefore, propose to blend propane and butane imported separately and produce LPG according to their specifications and export the same by ship on FoB basis ex-Haldia to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka or by road to Bangladesh,? IPPL CEO Mrinal Roy wrote to the petroleum ministry on April 5.

 IPPL wants to export 12,000 tonnes of LPG in 2005-06, 30,000 tonnes in 2006-07, 36,000 tonnes in 2007-08, 42,000 tonnes in 2008-09 and 50,000 tonnes in 2009-10.

 The company would earn $20 per tonne of exports.

 IPPL has been importing LPG since February 2002. It imported 8192 tonnes worth Rs 9.39 crore in 2001-02.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Brazil far behind but China way ahead

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 11: It takes 203 days to start a business in Haiti, but just 2 days in Australia. It takes 0.4 years (almost five months) to close down a business in Ireland while it takes as many as 10 years to pull down shutters in Brazil and Chad.

 India is lumped somewhere in the middle of the pack in a World Bank study titled Doing Business in 2005 that analyses the ease of doing business in 145 countries around the world.

 The study, which was released here today, says it takes 89 days to secure all clearances and approvals before one can start up operations in India. The comparable waiting period is 41 days in China and 152 days in Brazil ? which along with India are widely regarded as the three most vibrant emerging economies.

 India compares poorly within South Asia itself and is far below the South Asian average of 46 days to start a business in the region. Nepal has the shortest start-up time at 21 days followed by Pakistan (24 days), Bangladesh (35 days) and Sri Lanka (50 days).

 But it?s harder to close down operations in the country ? which, at 10 years, puts it among the worst countries along with Brazil and Chad. In contrast, businesses in China can be wound up in 2.4 years.

 The cost of firing ? which is an indicator that measures the cost of advance notice requirements, severance payments and penalties due when firing a worker in terms of weekly wages ? is also high at 79 weeks of wages though it is lower than the South Asian average of 84 weeks and that of China (90 weeks).

 The other big worry is over the enforcement of contracts in India where companies need to complete 40 procedures and the time taken is about 425 days ? which is worse than the South Asian average of 425. It takes 241 days to enforce contracts in China, 350 days in Nepal, 365 days in Bangladesh and 395 days in Pakistan. 

 Only Sri Lanka is worse off at 440 days.

 The World Bank ranks India fifth among the top 10 reformers in the world because of the way it has tweaked regulations in three key areas: the enforcement of contracts, the ease in getting credit and an improvement in the regulations governing the closure of businesses (even though it might take 10 years to actually do so).

 However, the Bank expresses concern about the huge gulf between per capita incomes of the rich and poor regions in the country. ?The gap in per capita incomes ? is a lot wider between Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, or Punjab and Madhya Pradesh, than it is between India and China,? it says.

 India presents several worrying factors for overseas investors, who might be looking at business opportunities in the Asia Pacific region. 

 A survey on India?s investment climate assessment that accompanied the study says respondents identified several bottlenecks in the country?s current investment climate: excessive or costly business regulation; corruption that this seems to breed and sustain; and serious deficiencies in power supply, the allocation of urban land, access to finance and the supply of skilled labour.

 If a company turns insolvent and enters into bankruptcy, creditors will stand to get just 13 cents on the dollar in Mumbai against 90 cents in Tokyo, says the World Bank study.

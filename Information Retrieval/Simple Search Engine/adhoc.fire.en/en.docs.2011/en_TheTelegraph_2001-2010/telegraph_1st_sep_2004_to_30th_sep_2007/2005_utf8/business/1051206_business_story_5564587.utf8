 Suspense on RIL demerger lingers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 5: Bombay High Court has reserved its order regarding the proposed demerger scheme of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) till December 9.

 The order was reserved by Justice Nishita Mhatre after counsels of Kalpesh Bharatkumar Mankad and RIL completed the arguments.

 Mankad counsel Jal Unwala said the demerger scheme contained contradictions and that circulated among the shareholders and produced before the court differed in some respects. He also contended that the company did not disclose its latest financial position.

 He pointed out that RIL has not specified the assets and liabilities that will be transferred to the new entities. Unwala said while the shareholders have been informed that some assets are being demerged to the coal-based undertaking, the company has not specified these assets or liabilities. This is also the case with the financial services undertaking, he added.

 If these aspects are not highlighted, on what basis will shareholders cast their votes? he asked. 

 Unwala made it clear that his client was not against the demerger scheme, but was concerned about non-disclosure of material facts. 

 According to Unwala, while the cut-off date for the demerger was August 31, RIL had not informed about its latest financial position, which amounted to non-disclosure of material facts. He also said financial data between March 31 and September 30 showed a fall in segment revenue.

 Unwala added that the discrepancy in the scheme as presented to the shareholders and the court will lead to easy swapping of assets between the entities if the version presented to the court was passed unchanged.

 Appearing on behalf of RIL, Iqbal Chagla said while the cut-off date was September 1, the transfer of assets was done prior to this date. 

 Countering the allegations of a possible asset swapping, Chagla said after the demerger, the transferred assets are to be held by new entities, which will be carved out of RIL. As every shareholder of RIL will hold equal shares in newly formed companies, there is no scope for any unfair swapping of assets and members would not lose on their investment

 The company could not present its latest financial data as the results were announced after an application was made to the court, he added. 

 Regarding the discrepancies between the text of the scheme presented before the shareholders and the court, Chagla said those were only typographical errors.

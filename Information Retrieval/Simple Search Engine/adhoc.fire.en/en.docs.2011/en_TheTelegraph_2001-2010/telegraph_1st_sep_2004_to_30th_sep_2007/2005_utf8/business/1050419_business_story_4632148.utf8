 Deep divide on network cyber laws

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 18: Private network service providers ? like Internet service operators and telecom firms ? have opposed a separate law to deal with cyber offences related to network operators.

 The network operators strongly countered the government?s proposed separate sectoral laws and suggested framing of rules and regulation under the Information Technology Act governing them.

 Speaking at a legal seminar on cyber security organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), T. K. Vishwanathan, secretary, legislative department, ministry of law and justice said, ?The IT act has been blamed for shortcomings in areas which it was not meant to address. For example, network service providers were meant to be covered under another act and not under the IT act.?

 ?There is a need for sectoral laws to deal with them effectively. If we bring in more amendments to the IT Act, it will only weaken it,? said Vishwanathan.

 He said six years back India undertook a limited mission with the IT Act even though the law enforcement agencies were not aware of the possible cyber offences. 

 ?New technologies pose problems and fascinate us. Cyber space is an illusion and not a reality but when it strikes, you have to take note and address the challenges,? said Vishwanathan.

 Amitabh Singhal, director general of Internet Service Providers Association, vehemently opposed a separate law for network service providers and said, ?There is no need for a separate law. The current provisions in the IT act are enough, the government should frame rules and regulations that are not still spelt out regarding the network service providers or are vague.?

 The private telecom operators pointed that the government had deliberated the aspect of a separate law for network service providers, but had decided to incorporate the same in the IT act to make it more robust. 

 Pawan Duggal, a senior cyber law expert, said, ?Section 79 of the IT act needs to be revisited by the lawmakers. Rules and regulations need to be framed urgently for many of the provisions in the IT act, without which confusions like that witnessed in the Bazee case will be repeated.?

 A senior AirTel executive said, ?We already have many old laws that are still used. It would be prudent for the government to examine those issues. The case on telemarketing is already pending before the Supreme Court and the outcome will certainly set a benchmark for future cases on network operators.?

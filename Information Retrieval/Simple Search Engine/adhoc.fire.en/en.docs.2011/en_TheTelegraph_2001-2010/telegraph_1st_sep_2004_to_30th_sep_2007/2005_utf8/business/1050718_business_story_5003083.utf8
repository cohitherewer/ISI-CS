 Numaligarh refinery rides Bangla tide

 Supply chain

 New Delhi, July 17: A diesel consignment from Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) has reached Budge Budge by barge via Bangladesh through the Brahmaputra in 42 days.

 The commercial success of the trial run has opened up the possibility of exporting diesel to Bangladesh through the river route, which land-locked NRL intends to explore.

 The diesel was first brought by road from Numaligarh to Silghat, situated at a distance of 110 km on the banks of the Brahmaputra. It was then loaded on to the barge named Naharkatia, which carried 1,500 tonnes of diesel to Budge Budge in 42 days. Consignments will reach Bangladesh sooner as they are nearer to Silghat than Budge Budge.

 The barge is one of two owned by Vivada, a private company, and has a capacity of 1,800 tonnes. Since night navigation is not possible on inland waterways, the barge could sail only during daytime. 

 The trial run is considered to be a commercial success as an earlier attempt by the Calcutta-based Central Inland Waterway Transport Corporation to carry diesel to Budge Budge had taken around 85 days.

 While Naharkatia has taken 42 days to reach its destination, it can reach sooner if night navigation facilities are made available, at least on some sections of the route. 

 The government is keen on developing the inland waterways for a cheap and eco-friendly way of transporting goods. Attempts have been made earlier to encourage night navigation by installing lighting facilities on some river routes, but these have ended up being stolen by local miscreants. 

 A senior official told The Telegraph a security system backed by the local village panchayats would have to be evolved to safeguard night navigation facilities.

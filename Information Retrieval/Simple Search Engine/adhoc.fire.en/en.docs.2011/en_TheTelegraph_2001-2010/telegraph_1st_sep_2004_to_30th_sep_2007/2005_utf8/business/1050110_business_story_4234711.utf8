 PowerGrid foots delay bill

 Tall order

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd faces an extra expenditure of Rs 217.22 crore and a 30-month delay in construction of the Kishenpur-Moga transmission system as Cobra Instalactiones Y Servicios of Spain, the foreign contractor in the project, has failed to set up towers to carry power lines.

 The power transmission company is avoiding an enquiry from the ministry and claims that there was no discrepancy while selecting the foreign contractor for the project. PGCIL also claims that the extra expenditure would have been low if the World Bank had not insisted on granting two lines of 800 KV each.

 PGCIL is a public sector company and one of the largest transmission utilities in the world, which owns and operates regional and national transmission network of more than 48,000 circuit kilometers high-voltage transmission lines and 82 sub-stations across the country.

 The Kishenpur-Moga power transmission project (KMTS) was sanctioned in 1993 at an estimated cost of Rs 417.71 crore with a completion target of March 1998. The KMTS aims to transfer power from various generation projects in Jammu and Kashmir to the load centre at Moga in Punjab.

 A presentation made by PGCIL to the power ministry and members of Parliament said, ?Cobra emerged as the lowest bidder for both the lines of KMTS. (But) based on pre-qualification and evaluation of bidders, the company had assessed that Cobra would not be able to execute both the lines in view of the tower material required for both and 800-KV lines being constructed for the first time in India.?

 In its presentation, the company claimed, ?We had recommended the award of work for only one line to Cobra, which was, however, not accepted by the World Bank. So the contract was awarded for both lines to Cobra in 1995.?

 However, the World Bank supervision mission in 1993 had suggested construction of two 400-KV double circuit lines instead of 800- KV lines, to defer the 8000-KV conversion investment till 2015-20. 

 But PGCIL went ahead with the construction of the 800-KV transmission lines on grounds of difficulties in acquiring right of way and prolonged government clearance procedure.

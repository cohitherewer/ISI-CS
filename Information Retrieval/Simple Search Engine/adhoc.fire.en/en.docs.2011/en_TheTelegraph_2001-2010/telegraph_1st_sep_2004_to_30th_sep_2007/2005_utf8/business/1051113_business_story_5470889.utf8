 Skoda bets on new models

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 12: Skoda Auto is planning to ramp up its presence in India by rolling out new models or variants of its existing ones. As a step towards that, the Indian subsidiary of the Czech auto major today commissioned its expanded assembly line at Aurangabad in Maharashtra. The assembly line will double the production capacity to 30000 units. This greenfield assembly line is the first plant of Skoda Auto outside Europe.

 Czech President Vaclav Klaus, who is on a state visit to India, commissioned the unit today. Work for the project had started in March this year and was completed ahead of schedule.

 The expansion of the assembly line was necessitated for the adoption of new technologies.

 Sources close to the automaker said the new line would enable Skoda to launch other models from its parents stable. In fact, plans are afoot to make the Aurangabad unit Skodas manufacturing hub for the South Asian region. 

 The idea is to bring out a new model or a variant of the existing models every 2-3 months. On this new A5 platform, a new Octavia will be launched, company sources said.

 Skoda Auto Indias current year sales are riding high. For instance, last month alone, we sold 990 cars, which was a 64 per cent increase from 603 cars sold in the same month last year, a Skoda official said.

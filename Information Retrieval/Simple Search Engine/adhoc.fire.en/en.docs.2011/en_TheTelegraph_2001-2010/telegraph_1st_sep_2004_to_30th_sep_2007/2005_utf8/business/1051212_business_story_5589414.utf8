 Ma Foi to focus on career counselling

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, Dec. 11: Ma Foi Management Consultants is betting big on career training to achieve a turnover of Rs 1000 crore in the next three years.

 Ma Foi managing director K. Pandia Rajan said, Our staffing services have grown by 75 per cent over the last 13 years. We expect a continuous growth between 50 per cent and 55 per cent over the next few years. However, our career training academy is expected to grow faster and finally contribute much more than the staffing services to the companys turnover.

 Ma Foi recorded a turnover of Rs 122 crore last year (Jan-Dec 2004) and expects to close this year at Rs 205 crore. The HR services provider currently has five academy centres but plans to increase the number to 150 by December 2006. Seven more centres will be added by December this year, including one in Calcutta.

 The academy is a finishing school for those seeking to finetune their skills to meet the requirements of the industry across major verticals like ITeS, e-learning, retail and sales and also in soft skills, said Rajan. These career training centres are aimed at enhancing the employability of aspirant candidates.

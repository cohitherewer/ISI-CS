 Calcutta, March 15: Purnendu Chatterjee, one of the principal promoters of Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL), wants to take full management control of the Rs 5,170-crore petrochem company. Last week, Chatterjee placed a proposal before the state government in this regard.

 At present, Chatterjee controls 41 per cent of HPL. The state holds a 56 per cent stake in the Rs 1410-crore equity and the remaining 3 per cent is with the Tatas.

 Chatterjee will have to increase his stake by 10 per cent to take management control. The state has discussed the matter with adviser L. B. Jha amp; Co.

 Bengal commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen today had a two-hour meeting with chairman Tarun Das.

 HPL will soon appoint a consultant to carry out the valuation of its shares.

 Senior officials in the state commerce and industry department said: ?HPL has come out of the woods and has turned around. The value of its share, which was at one point of time below par, has gone up. We are not in a position to offer shares of the company at Rs 10. Unless HPL gets a better price, its shares will not be diluted.?

 They added that the company is expecting a Rs 700-750-crore net profit in the current fiscal. 

 Das, who attended an interactive session with the students of ICFAI after his meeting with Sen, told newspersons: ?We will hold a board meeting soon. Lots of issues will come up at the meeting, including the IPO, for approval. The issue of shares to Indian Oil Corporation will also be cleared in this meeting.? 

 However, he refused to speak about Chatterjee?s intention to jack up his stake in the petrochemical company.

 HPL will launch its much-awaited initial public offer in the second or third quarter of the next financial year. The IPO is part of the corporate debt-restructuring package.

 ?We have asked the CDR cell for more time to float the IPO,? Das said. Earlier the company had committed before the CDR cell that they would come up with the IPO before May 31.

 HPL officials said with TCG now claiming higher stakes in the company, the entire thing will have to be reworked. ?Therefore, the delay in floating the IPO,? they added.

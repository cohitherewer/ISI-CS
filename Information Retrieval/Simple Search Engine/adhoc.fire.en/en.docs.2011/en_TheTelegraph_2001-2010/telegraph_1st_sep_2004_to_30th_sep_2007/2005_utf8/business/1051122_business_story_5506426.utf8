 Mentor bids for Medicis 

 Chicago, Nov. 21 (Reuters): Mentor Corp, a US-based maker of breast implants and other medical devices, said it had proposed a $2.2-billion bid for Medicis Pharmaceutical Co, turning an existing industry takeover battle on its head. 

 Official word of the proposal came on Sunday from Medicis, a Scottsdale, Arizona-based drug maker embroiled in a bidding war of its own for another breast implant maker, Inamed Corp. 

 Medicis said its board had received an offer from Mentor ? and unanimously rejected it. In the statement, Medicis said the Mentor bid was inappropriate in light of the recent trading history of the two companies and the pending stockholder votes on its now faltering acquisition of Inamed. 

 But in its own statement, Mentor said its proposed offer was superior to Medicis Inamed deal and had a better chance of closing quickly. 

 Under the terms of the proposed deal, Mentor would exchange 0.62 of its own shares for each share of Medicis. That represents an offer price of about $34.81 a share ? a premium of about 25 per cent over where Medicis shares closed Friday. 

 Josh Levine, the president and chief executive of Mentor, also suggested his company was willing to alter the terms of the offer to include some cash component.

 Should the Medicis board want Medicis stockholders to receive a portion of the consideration in cash, we would be prepared to move in that direction, he said.

 That Medicis, which makes drugs to treat skin problems, has become the target of a takeover by Santa Barbara, California-based Mentor is sure to generate feelings of deja vu among some investors.

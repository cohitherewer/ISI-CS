 Duke buys Cinergy for $9bn

 New York, May 9 (Reuters): US power company Duke Energy Corp on Monday said it would buy Cinergy Corp for nearly $9 billion in an all-stock deal to expand its reach in the regulated utility and merchant power businesses.

 The move boosts Charlotte, North Carolina-based Dukes presence in the US Midwest, particularly in the retail electric and gas business, while offering cost savings on the merchant power front.

 Under the terms of the deal, each Cinergy share will be converted into 1.56 shares of Duke Energy. Cincinnati-based Cinergy has an average of about 198 million shares outstanding, according to a company spokesman, which would value the deal at about $9 billion. 

 Dukes offer was worth $45.80 a share, a 13.4 per cent premium to Cinergys closing share price on Friday of $40.38 a share.

 ?For Cinergy shareholders this is a home run,? said Gordon Howald, analyst with Natexis Bleichroeder. ?Its a natural extension of where theyve been headed.?

 About 1,500 jobs ? or about 5 per cent of the companies combined work force of 29,350 ? will be cut, mainly through attrition, early retirements and other severance programmes. 

 The combined company will own or operate about 54,000 megawatts of electric generation domestically and overseas.

 Cinergy shareholders will own about 24 per cent of the firm, while Duke Energy shareholders will own the remaining 76 per cent. The deal will be accretive to Dukes earnings in the first full year of operation. Dukes CEO Paul Anderson will become chairman of the combined firm, while Cinergys top executive James Rogers will assume the post of CEO and president.

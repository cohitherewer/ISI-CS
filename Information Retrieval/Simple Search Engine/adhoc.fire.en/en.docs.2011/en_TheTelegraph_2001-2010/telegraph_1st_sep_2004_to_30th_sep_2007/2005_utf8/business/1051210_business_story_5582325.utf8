The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Roadmap to draw investors

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 9: Bengal information technology minister Manabendra Mukherjee today called for a common cluster of the eastern and northeastern states to attract investments.

 If the country has to increase its software exports potential, investment flow cannot be confined to a select few states, Mukherjee said at the conclusion of the three-day Infocom 2005.

 The eastern and northeastern states should share their experiences and draft a common agenda that will drive investments. Infocom has provided us a platform for dialogue in this matter, he added.

 The minister also urged the governments to ensure that technology is used to add value to the everyday life of the common man.

 The government should be proactive in bridging the digital divide. The success of any e-governance project will depend on the political, ideological and social attitude of the government, he said.

 GE earnings rise 18%

 Getting Into Growth mode

 Boston, Jan. 22 (Reuters): General Electric Co. has posted an 18 per cent rise in quarterly profit, driven by broad-based growth as it won new jet engine service contracts and had solid orders for ultrasound equipment. 

 GE, whose products range from gas turbines to television shows and credit cards, repeated its forecast for earnings growth in 2005 and said an increase of more than 10 per cent was sustainable into 2006. GE chief executive Jeff Immelt also delivered a bullish view on the global economy, categorising it as ?excellent?.

 GEs fourth-quarter net profit rose to $5.38 billion, or 51 cents a share, from $4.56 billion, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average forecast earnings of 50 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue jumped 18 per cent to $43.7 billion, and orders rose by more than 15 per cent. 

 ?Orders were up very strongly and that points to a very good outlook for the rest of the year, and the possibility that earnings estimates for the year will rise,? said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management, which owns a small stake in GE. 

 By late afternoon, the shares of GE were down slightly as rising oil prices pressured the broader market after being up more than 1 per cent earlier in the day. GE reported double-digit percentage growth in earnings at nine of its 11 business segments.

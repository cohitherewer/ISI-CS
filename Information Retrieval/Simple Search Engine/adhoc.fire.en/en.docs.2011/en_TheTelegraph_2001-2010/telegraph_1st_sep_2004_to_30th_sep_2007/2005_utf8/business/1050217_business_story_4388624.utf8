 CLB verdict on Birla petition after full hearing

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 16: The Company Law Board (CLB) today declined to pass an interim order on the petition filed by late M. P. Birla?s sisters, Laxmi Devi Newar and Radha Devi Mohatta. 

 The petition accused Rajendra Singh Lodha of fraudulently transferring 33,715 shares of East India Investment Company in his name after Priyamvada Birla?s death.

 The sisters had prayed for cancellation of the transfer of shares, which were in the name of Priyamvada Birla, and appointment of a special officer to take possession of the shares, register of members and other relevant records of the company.

 As the matter came up for hearing today, the lawyers representing the sisters argued that the transfer of share was done with the objective of usurping control of the MP Birla group. 

 Arguing before CLB chairman S. Balasubramanian, they pleaded for an interim order to restrain Lodha from exercising voting rights, selling of these shares and getting dividends. 

 But the CLB decided against passing an interim order and said it would pass its judgment only after fully hearing the case.

 HP to lower headcount

 London/Frankfurt, Sept. 13 (Reuters): Hewlett-Packard (HP) will cut 2,500 jobs in Germany and Britain, it said on Tuesday ? a sixth of the jobs it plans to slash worldwide as it slims down to compete in cut-throat printer and computer markets.

 The worlds second-biggest computer maker said it would cut 1,500 jobs in Germany and 968 jobs in Britain as it streamlines its global workforce to save $1.9 billion a year.

 In Germany, Europes biggest economy, HP will lose a sixth of its staff by the end of next year, adding to anxieties about record unemployment there ahead of a general election on Sunday which Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is expected to lose.

 A spokesman for HP Germany said all the companys main divisions would be affected, and that negotiations had begun with trade unions.

 In Britain, the jobs will be cut over the next 12 months. A spokesman said production there would be little affected, with the job cuts mainly in human resources, IT and finance.

 He would not give a figure for compulsory redundancies, saying it was too early in the process.

 HPs five British sites ? Bracknell, Bristol, Glasgow, Reading and Warrington ? will all see job cuts but Glasgow will not be heavily affected because it is a production centre. It is all about streamlining the company, the UK spokesman said.

 The job cuts, announced by new chief executive Mark Hurd in July, are the deepest since ousted CEO Carly Fiorina cut around the same number of staff in May 2002 after HP bought rival Compaq Computer. On August 16, HP posted quarterly results that topped Wall Street forecasts as its personal and business computer units showed strong improvement.

 But analysts still want HP to cut more jobs, to spin off its lucrative imaging and printing group or to divest its personal computing business, where costs are still higher than those of Dell.

 RBI slaps penalty on ING Vysya

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 24: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has imposed a penalty of Rs 5 lakh on ING Vysya Bank for violating its instructions and guidelines. Close to 44 per cent in the bank is held by the ING Group,

 The RBI said ING Vysya Bank had not deducted the full amount of unamortised VRS expenditure, thereby violating the central banks instructions. This resulted in overstating Tier I capital and CRAR in the disclosures in the banks balancesheet for March 31, 2004, it added.

 Moreover, the bank had also not provided for outstanding debit entries in inter-branch accounts pending for more than six months, as required by the RBI, thereby impacting the profits for 2003-04.

 This apart, the bank had also contravened RBI guidelines in financing promoters contribution; offering interest concession to borrowers availing of insurance products floated by its group company and classifying ineligible advances under priority sector credit.

 The penalty was imposed under provisions of Section 47 A (1) (b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

 The Reserve Bank has also directed the bank to disclose the particulars of the penalty in the notes on accounts to the balancesheet in the annual report.

 The central bank said it had issued a show-cause notice to ING Vysya Bank, in response to which the banks CEO had sought a personal hearing, which was given. 

 The bank had then made a written submission. On a careful examination of the submissions, the Reserve Bank concluded that the violations were substantiated and a penalty was imposed, the central bank said.

 In October 2004, as part of measures to improve the transparency of banks, the Reserve Bank had decided to disclose, in public domain, information on penalties imposed on banks after due process of advising the bank concerned and seeking its explanation.

 The Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on stock market scam in its report had recommended that the comments made by the Reserve Bank in the inspection reports should be published in the annual reports of banks along with financial results to ensure greater transparency. 

 These recommendations were examined by the RBI in consultation with the Standing Technical Advisory Committee on Financial Regulation and the Board for Financial Supervision.

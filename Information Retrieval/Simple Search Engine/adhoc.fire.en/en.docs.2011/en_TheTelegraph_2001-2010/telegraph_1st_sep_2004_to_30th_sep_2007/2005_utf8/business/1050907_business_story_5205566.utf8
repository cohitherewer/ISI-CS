 Calcutta, Sept. 6: LG Electronics India Limited (LGEIL) is gearing up to cash in on the festive season to reach its turnover target of Rs 9000 crore for the current accounting year (Jan-Dec 2005).

 The consumer electronics firm had sold goods worth Rs 1000 crore for the two-month festive season in 2004 and expects to register Rs 1500-crore sales this year from products across all categories.

 As part of its thrust on seasonal sales, LG has launched a range of products in the colour TV category, which includes slim flat TV, DTH flat TV and wireless audio output TV.

 Amitabh Tiwari, product group head for CTVs, LGEIL, said, We plan to tap the 40 million homes in the country that do not have cable connection with the DTH-enabled television. This product will mainly cater to the rural and semi-urban population. The slim TV, on the other hand, is meant for the urban citizen who has space constraints.

 LG also plans to bring in a conventional DTH model to tap the entry-level consumer in the next three months.

 We expect the DTH TV to contribute to 3 per cent of the total colour TV sales, said Tiwari. We do not expect to see a huge demand in the urban areas. The product will mainly be a facilitator in the range of products. The idea is to create a market space for this product.

 The digital audio-video business is expected to contribute Rs 300 crore to the total target turnover. Thirty-nine per cent of the total turnover comes from the consumer electronics division.

 LG has 27 per cent of the CTV market in India and expects to increase its market share to 30 per cent this year. Its share in the east is also expected to go up to 35 per cent from 32 per cent.

 Peirer: Big plans

 Mumbai, Feb. 9: Siemens India plans to invest $500 million in the country over the next three to four years to set up new factories, expand existing capacities and improve research and development, said Heinrich Pierer, chairman of the supervisory board of Siemens AG, today. 

 Peirer was speaking on the sidelines of the Nasscom 2005 India Leadership Forum. 

 While Siemens India will make most of the investments, the parent company, which holds close to 55 per cent, might chip in if necessary.

 ?Primarily, the investments will be made by Siemens India as it is in a good financial shape. But if necessary, Siemens AG will also chip in with new investment plans,? he said. 

 Pierer said India occupies a crucial place in the multinational?s global operations as the country is a base not only for local business but for global business too.

 Siemens? investment plans comes after the company announced robust quarterly results recently. Analysts expect the performance to improve in the coming months, particularly after the Centre has cleared the electricity act.

 ?We will build new factories and expand existing ones, and also invest heavily in R amp;D. May be it will take three to four years,? Pierer added.

 On the companys R amp;D plans, he said Siemens will set up more R amp;D centres and recruit around 70 software professionals at its Bangalore centre. 

 The company is planning to export software solutions, hardware and medium-sized switch gear, even as it expects a 10 per cent growth from the country.

 For the first quarter ended December 31, Siemens India posted a 88 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 44.5 crore against Rs 23.7 crore in the corresponding period last year. This came on the back of a 64 per cent rise in sales turnover to Rs 503 crore against Rs 308 crore. The growth and volume drivers were the power, automation, industrial solutions and services segments. 

 The company also has a healthy order book position reflecting the positive times being faced by the Indian economy.

 Unpaid bank dividend heads to investor kitty

 GAURAV CHOUDHURY

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: Banks will have to compulsorily park the dividends unclaimed by their shareholders with the Investor Education and Protection Fund (IEPF) ? a kitty dedicated to create awareness among investors.

 The Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) and Financial Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2005 entails a new accounting system, under which banks will have to stash away the unpaid portion of the dividend kitty declared for shareholders to a special account called unpaid dividend account. 

 The money will remain parked in the specially created account for a period of seven years after which it will be transferred to IEPF, said a senior banker.

 A seven-year period is time enough for any investor to stake his or her claim. The objective is not to put the genuine investors into any kind of inconvenience, but to make good use of the money as its lying unutilised, he added.

 The unclaimed dividends refer to the part of the total payout which has not been tendered (or encashed) by the shareholders within a period of six weeks from the date posting of the dividend warrants.

 The bill, introduced earlier this year, is currently before the standing committee on finance. 

 The money in the unpaid dividend account will eventually be transferred to the IEPF, which was created by amending the Companies Act, 1956 after a scam rocked the countrys stock markets in 2001.

 At present, banks are not required to transfer their unpaid dividends to the IEPF ? only companies need to do so under section 250C of the Companies Act ? and it remains in their books as a suspense account. 

 Officials said since it was set up, the IEPF has been funding various activities, including the setting up of a national registry of economic defaulters and vanishing companies. After the amendment in the Companies Act, listed companies are required to declare the amount of unclaimed dividend and the seven-year time frame within which the amount will be transferred to the IEPF.

 According to sources in the department of company affairs (DCA), the nodal administrator of the fund, the corpus of IEPF has crossed Rs 500 crore already.

 Europe clears Sony?s $3bn bid for MGM

 Turning point

 Brussels, March 31 (Reuters): A group headed by Sony Corp of America won approval from the European Commission on Thursday to buy Hollywood film studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for close to $3 billion in cash.

 The deal will allow Sony to make use of MGM?s lucrative library for the DVD market, and also create the world?s largest film library of about 7,600 titles.

 ?After examining the operation, the Commission concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition in the EEA (European Economic Area) or in any substantial part of it,? the EU executive said in a statement.

 The Sony Group comprises Sony Corp of America, private firms Providence Equity Partners, Texas Pacific Group and DLJ Merchant Banking, and cable television company Comcast Corp.

 It is paying $12 per share, or about $3 billion in cash, plus another $2 billion in assumed debt for MGM, whose principal asset is its large film catalogue.

 The 80-year-old studio owns films featuring icons from Elvis to James Bond and produced such classics as ?Gone With the Wind? and ?The Wizard of Oz?, both in 1939.

 MGM chief financial officer Dan Taylor will run the film studio after the group acquires it later this year.

 ?The market shares or market position of the combined entity would not materially affect the competitive landscape for the release of films, TV programs ? including films ? or home entertainment,? the Commission statement said.

 When the deal was announced last year, Sony said it had reached a separate deal with top US cable TV operator Comcast to offer Sony and MGM movies over its video-on-demand systems and new cable channels that it would form with the Sony group.

 Including the titles owned by Sony Pictures Entertainment, the Sony group will now control about 40 per cent of all movies ever produced by Hollywood, according to some estimates.

 Protect capital, reap profit 

 IN THE ERA of market-linked returns, ICICIPru Life Insurance has unveiled unit-linked products to protect a policyholder?s capital while making provisions to earn such profits.

 InvestShield ? a unit-linked capital guarantee insurance plan ? is structured in four variations.

 InvestShield Life gives the value of the policy only at the end of the term. InvestShield Cash gives liquidity benefits during the policy term and returns the policy value at the end. Invest Shield Gold is for people who want a limited premium-paying term, but seek the protection and savings benefits over a longer tenure. InvestShield Pension is a retirement solution.

 The plans are structured so that the premiums are invested in a market-linked unit fund. A maximum of 30 per cent of the fund (other than Cash) is invested in equities and the balance in debts or bonds. While the market-linked unit fund offers the opportunity to get the upside of the market, the risk on investments due to volatility is protected by a guarantee, which increases every year.

 Other features include extended life cover, whereby apart from the insurance cover during the term of the plan, InvestShield Life also offers an additional insurance protection of 50 per cent of the sum assured free for 10 years, after the maturity of the plan.

 With the policies, one can earn up to Rs 13,500 as guaranteed additions, paid in lump sum on death or maturity. Higher the premium and term of the plan selected, higher will be the amount of guaranteed additions.

 One can choose the level of protection and can also invest more by using a top-up facility. The plans also provide the flexibility to increase or decrease one?s annual premium. One can also choose automatic premium payment to avoid lapse of policy.

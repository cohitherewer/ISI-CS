 Calcutta, Sept. 6: In a major consolidation move, Global Steel Holding Ltd (GSHL) ? the UK-based company owned by Pramod and Vinod Mittal ? has taken home-grown Ispat Industries into its fold.

 GSHL, which has operations in six countries with a total steel-making capacity of 14 million tonnes, has taken over the smaller companies that formed the promoters group of Ispat Industries.

 GSHL has an asset base of $10 billion and Ispat Industries, which is in the process of expanding its capacity to 3.3 million tonnes by the year end, will get a bigger financial leverage to raise funds.

 The Indian promoters hold about 6.77 per cent of Ispats equity while the remaining 47.71 per cent was with foreign promoters on June 30.

 The latest balance sheet of Ispat Industries reveals that GSHL is now the holding company of Ispat Steel Holding Ltd with a shareholding of 37.14 per cent. Securex Holding Ltd has another 3.84 per cent. Before the consolidation, GSHL held a 6.73 per cent stake.

 The PK-VK Mittal group, which is headquartered in Jebel Ali in Dubai, will now be a strong international player in steel. It also now becomes the largest steel group operating in India, overtaking state-run Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Tata Steel.

 Incidentally, Mittal Steel, the largest steel maker in the world with 70 million tonnes, is owned by Laxmi Niwas Mittal, the elder brother of Pramod and Vinod Mittal. All three are from Calcutta.

 Industry sources said GSHL was now looking at expanding capacity at a rapid pace. GSHL is looking to raise capacity to 20 million tonnes across the globe, sources added. 

 In the recent past, the group has grown at a scorching pace by acquiring plants in various locations. At present, it has operations in Nigeria, the Philippines, Libya, Bulgaria and Bosnia in addition to India. 

 Sources said the company was looking at takeovers in other parts of the world to scale up capacity to the targeted level of 20 mt.

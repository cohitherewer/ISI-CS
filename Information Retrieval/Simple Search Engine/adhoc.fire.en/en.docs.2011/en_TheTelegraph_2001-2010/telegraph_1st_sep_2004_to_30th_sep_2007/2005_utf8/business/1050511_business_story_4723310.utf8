 Orchid inks fresh pact with Par Pharma

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 10: Chennai-based Orchid Chemicals amp; Pharmaceuticals has signed a fresh marketing pact with Par Pharmaceuticals Inc to include its four non-antibiotic products for distribution in the US generics market. 

 The Indian drug manufacturer has also signed a deal with Phoenix Scientific Inc for a unique veterinary cephalosporin product for selling in the US, Canada and Mexico markets.

 Orchid has informed the stock exchanges today that the four non-antibiotic products Par Pharma will sell fall under the CNS and anti- emetic segments.

 The two distribution deals come in the wake of two other major agreements Orchid had signed in February with Alpharma and Stada for the non-antibiotics segment for the US and Europe markets. Under the agreements, Orchid will exclusively develop and manufacture 10 non-antibiotic formulations in specific dosage forms and strengths for exclusive distribution and marketing in the US and Europe. Orchid had then said the market size of the 10 products in the US and Europe totalled around $10 billion.

 All these four agreements taken together cover most of Orchids blockbuster products currently under patent and involve a development funding revenue stream of $25 million. The money is payable to Orchid between 2005 and 2007 in milestone-linked instalments. The first milestone payment, the company said, has already been received upon execution of the agreements.

 The company had earlier entered into such agreements with Apotex and Par Pharma for the distribution of its sterile and oral antibiotic formulation range of products, which are set to be launched in the US this fiscal pending the regulatory approval and patent expiry.

 Orchid will also receive a profit share as and when the products are commercialised. Currently, these products have a $25-billion retail market in the US and select European countries. 

 The Indian pharma major has announced a net profit of Rs 31.01 crore for 2004-05 compared with Rs 31.03 crore in the previous year. Orchids turnover for the year slipped to Rs 689.29 crore from Rs 713.41 crore in 2003-04. In 2004-05, its sale of bulk actives accounted for Rs 600.93 crore. 

 However, the domestic formulations business was affected by the slowdown in the trade channels due to the new value-added tax. As a result, this business generated a lower turnover for the company at Rs 96.20 crore compared with Rs 104.41 crore in the previous year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Jessop rights to open on Oct 26

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 21: Wagon maker Jessop amp; Cos Rs 50-crore rights issue will open on October 26. The issue will close on November 1.

 The Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) has exempted Jessop from getting Sebi clearance for the rights issue, said a spokesperson and added that it would reduce expenses.

 The rights issue will strengthen Jessops balance sheet and help it become a positive net-worth company. Following this, the company will be able to move out of the BIFR net. 

 The rights issue will be at par and is to be issued at the rate of 5.5:1 ratio.

 At present, promoter Pawan Ruia holds 72 per cent stake in the company, the central government 27 per cent and the rest 1 per cent is with retail investors.

 If the government declines to put in its share of funds ? and it is likely that the Centre will not subscribe to the new shares ? Ruia companies are willing to chip in the money. This will raise the promoters stake to above 80 per cent.

 According to the shareholders agreement signed during the divestment, the combined shareholding between us and the government has to be 99 per cent. So, we are willing to put in the money, Ruia had said earlier.

 The agreement also mentions that the government has to make an offer to part with its existing stake in the company after August 29, 2006. In such a scenario, the government is likely to renounce its obligation in the rights issue with Ruia.

 The spokesperson pointed out that the government is yet to inform about its decision.

 According to the restructuring strategy, the paid-up capital of Jessop was brought down to Rs 9.5 crore from Rs 95 crore by reducing the face value of shares to Re 1 of each Rs 10 paid-up share.

 This helped the company reduce losses to Rs 33 crore from Rs 118 crore. It set off the losses against the capital written off. 

 After the rights issue, the total paid-up capital will rise to Rs 59.5 crore and the accumulated losses will stand at Rs 33 crore.

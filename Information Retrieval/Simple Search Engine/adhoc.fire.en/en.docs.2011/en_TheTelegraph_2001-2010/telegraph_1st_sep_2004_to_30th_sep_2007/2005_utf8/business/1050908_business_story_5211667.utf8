 Battle for spectrum turns raucous

 M. RAJENDRAN 

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: Mobile operators, led by Bharti and Hutch, have complained to communications minister Dayanidhi Maran that they would face an additional investment burden of Rs 3,000 crore if the government decides to allocate additional spectrum to operators like Reliance and Tata. 

 Spectrum represents airwaves on which calls and data travel. 

 The war over spectrum allocation between operators using code division multiple access (CDMA) like Reliance and Tata and those using global system for mobile communications (GSM) like Bharti and Hutch reached Marans office yesterday. 

 It prompted the minister to immediately set up a joint working group to sift through the claims and counter-claims in what is turning out to be a pretty raucous debate. 

 Before that, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) and the Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India (Auspi) ? the rival forums that represent GSM and CDMA operators respectively ? had made presentations to the communications minister to buttress their arguments.

 In its presentation last week, Auspi did not focus on any monetary loss and highlighted the fact that it had been given a raw deal in allocation of spectrum when the CDMA operators migrated from a single licence system. 

 However, COAI said GSM operators were being asked to shoulder an unfair cost burden in terms of additional capital expenditure in setting up extra cell sites. 

 In Delhi alone, each large GSM operator has made an additional capital expenditure of about Rs 200 crore to Rs 250 crore and each GSM operator in the capital is spending about Rs 4 to 5 crore per month on operational expenses, the COAI told Maran in its presentation.

 The presentation claimed that the total additional cost per GSM operator in Delhi would exceed Rs 125 crore a year. 

 COAI also told Maran that it was important that both GSM and CDMA operators should make equal efforts to maximise the capacity of their assigned spectrum, and further assignments should be made only after ensuring optimal utilisation of existing assignments 

 Contesting the claim, Auspi has told the minister that spectrum charges have never been linked to subscriber numbers. This misinformation has been spread by a certain section within the industry (read COAI), which has always strived to derail progress in the telecom sector. Spectrum charges have always been fixed for a particular quantum of spectrum. This has been the governments policy and clearly mentioned in their order, said S.C. Khanna, secretary-general of Auspi. 

 The cellular operators, on the other hand, have strongly opposed any additional allocation of spectrum to CDMA operators as this would give them a backdoor entry in third generation (3G) services.

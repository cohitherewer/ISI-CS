 Global forces cast shadow on growth

 Reddy: Worrying signs

 Mumbai, Nov. 5: India?s growth outlook has improved in recent months but the persistence of global imbalances and high oil prices pose new challenges in maintaining price and financial stability, Reserve Bank governor Y.V. Reddy said during a round table discussion organised by Banque de France in Paris. 

 Speaking at the international symposium on ?Implication of global financial imbalances for the emerging market economies?, the RBI governor said, ?India would also be indirectly impacted by currency readjustments and changes in global interest rates.? 

 Outlining the risks facing India, Rao added, ?Persistence of global imbalances and high oil prices with a significant permanent component do pose some risks. Furthermore, the credit growth has recently been extremely strong, possibly affecting credit quality. The money supply is over-shooting the anticipated trajectory and strong investment demand coupled with high oil prices is turning the current account surplus into a deficit, though modest and manageable through normal capital flows. These developments give rise to new challenges to maintain price and financial stability while ensuring momentum in growth.?

 To contain and manage such risks, the RBI had raised the reverse repo rate (overnight liquidity absorption by the RBI) by 25 basis points to 5.25 per cent in its mid-term annual policy review on October 26. It also rationalised the limits on banks? exposure to capital markets. Moreover, the general provisioning requirement for standard advances was increased to 0.40 from 0.25 per cent.

 According to Reddy, it is not the Indian economy alone that will be impacted by changes in global interest rates. All the governments taking recourse to external borrowings to bridge their fiscal deficit will be affected. Though India does not raise resources from international capital markets, ?the spill-over of external developments on domestic interest rates can affect it,? the RBI governor added. ?This is because, if there is a rise in domestic interest rates, there could be an increase in the cost of government borrowings,? he clarified. 

 For the corporate sector too, an increase in global interest rates putting an upward pressure on the benchmarks such as Libor, may increase the cost of variable-rate debt contracted by them. Indian corporates have been borrowing extensively over the past two years from international markets to fuel their expansion and take advantage of low foreign interest rates.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Q amp;A

 On the age

 I want to invest in the senior citizens scheme jointly with my wife. Though I am 65 years old, my wife is not yet 60. Can I make the investment in joint name or do I have to make it in my name only? 

 R. C. Mallick, Calcutta

 For joint investment in the scheme, it is not necessary for both the spouses to be 60 years of age. Only one needs to fulfil the age criterion. 

 Joint venture

 We have invested Rs 6 lakh in a joint account of post office monthly income scheme. Can we invest an additional Rs 6 lakh in another joint account?

 Prihivijit Sengupta, Howrah

 No, the investment limit on post office MIS joint account is Rs 6 lakh.

 On my behalf

 I am an NRI and have given a power of attorney to my resident brother for conducting certain businesses on my behalf. Can he open a non-resident account and operate it?

 Sreepriya Mitra, by e-mail

 No, your brother cannot open the account. However, he can operate the accounts for the purpose of local payments to be made on your behalf. He is again not permitted to make gifts from these accounts and is also not allowed to make remittances outside India. 

 Giving up

 I had taken an insurance policy a few years back. However, I do not wish to continue it any longer. How do I surrender my policy?

 Amar Sharma, by e-mail

 The terms and conditions of policies attaining surrender value differ across the types of policies and the insurer. In most cases, if you pay a premium for a specified number of years, the policy acquires a surrender value. Thereafter, the policy can be surrendered for payment in cash. Once the policy is surrendered the insurance contract is terminated.

 Two more US airlines bankrupt

 New York, Sept. 14 (Reuters): Delta Air Lines and Northwest Airlines have declared bankruptcy as the industrys struggle with soaring oil prices and low-cost competition led to one of its darkest days.

 With the filings, both made in US bankruptcy court in Southern District of New York, four of the seven largest airlines in the US are now operating under Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection from their creditors.

 Both airlines would likely use bankruptcy to slash labour and pension costs, following in the footsteps of United Airlines, the main unit of UAL Corp and US Airways.

 With respective assets of $21.6 billion and $14.4 billion, Delta and Northwest became the second and third-largest US airline bankruptcies ever.

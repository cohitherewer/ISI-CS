 Pakistan lifts ban on Indian sugar import

 Islamabad, Aug. 2: After a gap of four years, Pakistan today lifted the ban on sugar import from India. It is expected to stabilise the sugar price in the neighbouring country.

 The decision was taken at the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz. ?Import of sugar from India, both refined and raw, has been allowed to stabilise its prices through enhanced supply,? said an official statement issued after the ECC meeting.

 The ECC has decided that besides the private sector, which has been allowed quota-free import of the commodity, the state-own Trading Corporation of Pakistan would also import 100,000 metric tonne of sugar from India.

 New Delhi has welcomed the move and Indian traders said they would be able to supply sugar at competitive prices. 

 Pakistan?s attempts to check sugar prices, which touched a four-year high in February, have been thwarted by low rainfall that is set to trim the crop by at least a fifth. Imports from other countries haven?t been enough to make up for the shortfall. 

 Pakistan had banned sugar import from India in 2001, after its domestic industry said cheap Indian sugar was hurting cane growers and processors. 

 Relations between the two South Asian neighbours began to improve with the commencement of the composite dialogue process early last year. Pakistan has already ordered import of livestock after buying garlic from India.

 Following the first consignment of fresh garlic from India, Pakistan will receive about 100 buffaloes and 200 goats later this week.

 However, media has reported that Indian authorities have refused to send cows as part of livestock exports to Pakistan, apparently for religious reasons. 

 Pakistan has allowed imports of fruits, vegetable and livestock via the Wagah border in May. The 13 commodities, allowed to be imported from India on zero-duty, include potatoes, onions, tomatoes, garlic, buffaloes, cows, goats, sheep and frozen meat.

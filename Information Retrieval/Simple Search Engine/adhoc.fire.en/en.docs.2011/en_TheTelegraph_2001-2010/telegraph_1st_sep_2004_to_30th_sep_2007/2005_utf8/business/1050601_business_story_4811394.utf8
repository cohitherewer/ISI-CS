 More room for Kenilworth 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 31: The Calcutta-based Kenilworth hotel is eyeing non-metros for expansion. 

 We are eyeing the high growth cities other then the metros for setting up four star properties, said Raju Bharat, managing director, The Kenilworth, which also has a property in Goa.

 Hyderabad is on the priority list of the company, followed by Pune, Bharat added. He said the total investment, excluding the land, for each property would be around Rs 35 crore.

 The company is also planning to test the water in Malaysia where it is taking part in a food festival. The company is toying with the idea of setting up restaurants offering authentic Indian cuisine in that country. We will explore the idea and may also consider other countries. However, we would prefer to commence with Malaysia since it is a low-cost destination, explained Bharat.

 The company is considering various options, including leasing of properties, for setting up restaurants in Malaysia. Leased property is the best option, Bharat said.

 An investment of at least Rs 2 crore would be required for such a project, he mentioned, adding that the company is also interested in taking part in the development of tea estates, the plan for which is still at the conceptualisation stage. He noted that the state government was considering to develop tea estates in the state to promote tourism, which would rekindle the fledgling hotel business. 

 We believe that North Bengal has got tremendous potential for developing tourism and such an attempt shall enhance the attraction of the region, Bharat said.

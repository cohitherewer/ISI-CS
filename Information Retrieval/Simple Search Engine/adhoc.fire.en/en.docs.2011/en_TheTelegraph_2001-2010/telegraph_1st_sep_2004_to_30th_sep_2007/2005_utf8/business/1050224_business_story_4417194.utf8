 New Delhi, Feb. 23: The government is keen to allow foreign direct investment (FDI) in retailing but feels that the initial focus should be in a sector like food processing.

 ?We are looking at it with a great sense of urgency. If we look at the food sector, it is the most compelling reason to allow FDI as 40 per cent of our fruits and vegetables rot due to lack of processing facilities,? Union commerce minister Kamal Nath said in his inaugural address at a retail seminar organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 However, he refused to spell out by when the government would decide on the issue.

 Allaying fears that FDI in retail will hurt small domestic traders in the country, he said, ?Any FDI should be incremental and not displace or replace the existing players.?

 He further said the primary focus should be on policy initiatives for the growth of the sector.

 ?We are clear that if at all FDI is permitted in retail trade, it should lead to incremental economic benefits and not substitute the on-going activities,? he added.

 Noting that the nature of the retail sector in India is far too complex for a hasty decision, he said greater caution was required to understand all the implications to take a consolidated view.

 Nath said, ?This whole fixation of permitting or not permitting FDI in the retail sector in my opinion is misplaced. FDI is not an end in itself but a means towards the end.? 

 The organised retail sector in India constitutes only 2 per cent of the industry in India against 20 per cent in China. In Asean nations, it is as high as 40 per cent. The minister said the expansion of the construction industry would have to be synchronised with the expansion of the retailing sector as the high costs of commercial space would determine future growth.

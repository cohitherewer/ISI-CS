 Trai suggests cut in mobile rates

 A STAFF REPORTER

Calcutta, March 17: Long distance calls from 

mobile phones could become marginally cheaper if the reviewed interconnection 

usage charges (IUC) suggested by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) 

come into effect.

 In a consultation paper issued today, Trai has recommended a cut in carriage charges for the higher distance slabs less than two months after it announced a reduction in the access deficit charge (ADC). Trai feels the carriage charges are higher by 10 per cent in the slabs of 200-500 kms and above 500 kms.

 IUC has three components ? carriage, termination and ADC ? which have to be determined based on usage time, according to the regulator. The cost-based charges for long distance carriage have been calculated at 21 paise, 65 paise, 85 paise and 94 paise per minute for distance slabs of 0 to 50 kms, 50-200 kms, 200-500 kms and above 500 kms respectively.

 International and national long distance charges have already seen a dropped after the implementation of the ADC regime from February 1. ADC is a fee that telecom operators pay to fund players who offer telecom services in rural and inaccessible areas where revenue earnings do not cover costs.

 Trai had said it would review the market in the next three months based on the growth in the subscriber base and minutes of usage. Trai has maintained since October 2003 that it will work towards a ?death of distance? concept. The regulator has also asked for usage data from all service providers, including BSNL, to review the termination charge, which is 30 paise per minute.

 Big two calm nerves over tax

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 13: Finance Minister P. Chidambaram today said fund inflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) would be watched, but reiterated that these would not be taxed. 

 The statement, widely seen as a bid to calm volatile markets, was supported later in the day by another from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh who said the government favoured an ?open economy? with greater foreign investment flows. 

 ?Every country monitors capital flows. We are also watching capital flows to the country,? Chidambaram told reporters at a conference here. ?But that does not mean curbing, capping or taxing foreign institutional investors.?

 The ministers statement came a day after Reserve Bank of India said it favoured curbs on such inflows. 

 RBI governor Y. V. Reddy had said in Mumbai yesterday that ?a view needs to be taken on capping FII flows. Price-based measures such as taxes could be examined though their effectiveness is arguable.?

 Chidambaram had reacted yesterday itself saying the governors statement had been misunderstood. The minister told newspersons he had spoken with Reddy on Wednesday evening and was told the RBI governors statement was misunderstood. 

 ?We want more foreign investment in India and also want Indians to invest abroad,? Singh said at a function held to launch a new television channel.

 The Prime Minister said the government would seek to encourage trade and investments by taking various steps, including lowering tariffs at least to Asean levels. ?This is a policy priority for us,? he said, adding India was also negotiating free trade agreements with Singapore and Asean. 

 Singh said he has already stated his commitment to the idea of creating an Asian economic community in which there are no barriers to trade and investment flows and to the movement of people.

 Singh added that his government had begun the process of rationalising indirect taxes and was moving towards a nation-wide value-added tax system and a common goods and service tax.

 He also pointed out that India has opened up international markets for domestic airlines so that they could become global players.

 Singh said policy steps were being taken to make a ?quantum leap in core sectors such as airports, roads, power, ports and railways.?

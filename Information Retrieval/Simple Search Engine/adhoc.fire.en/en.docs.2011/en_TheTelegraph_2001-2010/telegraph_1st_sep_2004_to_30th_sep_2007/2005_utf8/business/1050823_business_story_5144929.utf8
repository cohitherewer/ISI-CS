 Doosan eyes US nuclear tech firm

 Power-packed

 Seoul, Aug. 22 (Reuters): South Koreas Doosan Heavy Industries said on Monday it was considering bidding in a consortium to buy US nuclear power plant builder Westinghouse Electric Co from British nuclear energy company BNFL.

 South Koreas largest manufacturer of power generation equipment would be able to reduce costs and acquire nuclear technology and know-how from the US firm if a bid was successful, analysts said.

 Westinghouse provides nuclear fuel services, technology, plant design and equipment for nuclear power producers. State-owned BNFL bought the business, which employs about 9,000 people, from Swiss engineer ABB in 1999.

 We plan to form a consortium with other companies to bid for the company, Lee Soo-young, a vice president of Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction Co Ltd, said by telephone. Lee declined to name potential partners.

 Doosan, also the worlds leading builder of desalination facilities, would join a preliminary bidding process for Westinghouse due in the middle of September and a final bidding process would likely be held near the end of the year, he added.

 Nuclear-related businesses occupied around 20 per cent of Doosans total operations, Doosan spokesman Jang Mun-jo said. A significant part came through ties with Westinghouse.

 The US firm constructed South Koreas first nuclear power plant in the 1970s and has been sharing its technology with Doosan for more than 20 years, Jang said.

 Westinghouse also cooperated with Doosan to build a nuclear power plant in China this year, he added.

 Jang declined to provide specific figures Doosan paid for those services or discuss the exact nature of the cooperation, noting the sensitivity of the information.

 Kang Young-il, an analyst at Korea Investment and Securities, said Doosan would benefit from being part of an acquisition of Westinghouse.

 It would reduce their costs and it would acquire new technology, he said.

 Doosan, whose total market capitalisation stands at $1.73 billion, would be unable to finance an acquisition on its own, he added.

 They dont have enough money, Kang said.

 Japans Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd said early last month it would offer to buy Westinghouse Electric, with the companys spokesman estimating the deal would be worth about $1.78 billion.

 Washington is growing cautious about sales abroad of strategic energy-related companies, highlighted by the failed bid by CNOOC Ltd. of China for US oil group Unocal Corp., and some analysts predict this could prolong the bid process.

 Rossell flaps wings of desire

 Flying in 

 Calcutta, July 27: Rossell Tea Limited (RTL) may enter into the hotel and aviation businesses. It has sought shareholders approval to amend the companys memorandum of association to make a foray into these areas.

 The sluggishness in the tea market for the last four years has forced the company to consider new avenues.

 The tea industry is subject to cyclical fluctuations, which have a direct bearing on the performance and results of the company. The continued sluggishness in the tea market over the last few years has put severe pressure on the profitability. Therefore, the company had been looking at different diversification projects while evaluating its future prospects, N.K. Khurana, vice-president finance-cum-company secretary of Rossell Tea, said.

 The company is evaluating proposals for entering the business of hotels, restaurants, inns, cinemas, caf?, tavern and beer house.

 It is also looking at the options of manufacturing, buying and selling aircraft, aircraft systems, avionics and electronic components.

 Nearly five years ago, Rossell Tea had decided to enter the hotel business. They had also started negotiating with hotel chains at home and abroad. However, talks failed and Rossell Tea went in for tea estate acquisition.

 Khurana said there had been no discussions with any hotels so far. We are just seeking shareholders approval so that we do not have to delay if any opportunity arises, he added.

 Rossell Tea has five gardens within its fold ? Dikom, Nokroy, Nagrijuli, Romai and Bokakhat in Assam. 

 The total production of these five estates is 5.5 million kg. The company mostly produces quality orthodox tea. It exports tea to Germany, Ireland and United Kingdom. Currently it is exploring opportunities in West Asian countries like Iran. An improvement in relations with Pakistan could also boost tea trade, the company officials feel.

 The company had also undertaken corporate restructuring, after which, the Borahi Tea Estate has been transferred to its wholly-owned subsidiary Jyoti Holdings Pvt Ltd. The estate produces 1 million kg of black tea.

 The company has substantially saved on its overall cost of debt by replacing high-cost rupee loans with low-cost external commercial borrowings (ECBs). 

 The interest outgo of the company has come down to Rs 2.51 crore from Rs 3.73 crore in the previous year.

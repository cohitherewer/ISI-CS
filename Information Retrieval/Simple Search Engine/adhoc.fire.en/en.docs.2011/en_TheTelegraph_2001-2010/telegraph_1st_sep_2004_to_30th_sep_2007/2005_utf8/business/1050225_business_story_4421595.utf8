 Orchid in pact with Alpharma

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 24: The Chennai-based Orchid Chemicals amp; Pharmaceuticals Ltd (Orchid) has entered into an exclusive agreement with Alpharma Inc (Alpharma) to market its select non-antibiotic generic formulations in the US and Europe. 

 Under the agreement, Orchid will develop and manufacture 10 non-antibiotic formulations in specific dosage forms and strengths for exclusive distribution and marketing by Alpharma in the US and Europe. The current market size of the 10 products in the US and Europe aggregates to around $10 billion. 

 According to an Orchid statement, the 10 oral formulations come under speciality and chronic therapeutic segments such as cardiovascular (CVS) and central nervous system (CNS) categories.

 Orchid would commence supply of these products once they go off-patent progressively from 2007 based on its regulatory filings and approvals. 

 Alpharma would provide development funding to Orchid for the products based on milestones, while the net profit from marketing would be shared between both the partners.

 Both the partners said the combination of their manufacturing and marketing competencies would result in a leading position when the products become generic.

 The companies also hinted at the possibility of expanding the product range when they said there is opportunity to add further products progressively in subsequent years.

 Orchid is now establishing new US FDA-compliant infrastructure to develop and manufacture drugs in these non-cephalosporin segments. While the bulk active facility is being set up in Aurangabad, a formulations facility is coming up at Irungattukottai near Chennai. Both these facilities will be progressively commissioned during the first half of this year.

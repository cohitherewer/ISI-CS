 Ruia seeks state help to get Dunlop rolling

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ruia: Lets do it together

 Calcutta, Dec. 8: Pawan Ruia today sought the Bengal governments help in reopening Dunlops Sahagunj factory and winning back real estate now out of the firms control.

 Emerging from a meeting with commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen at Writers Buildings, Ruia said he hoped to get the Sahagunj unit humming by 2007. This would require an investment of Rs 150 crore.

 Ruia requested Sen to work out a package that waives a part of the sales tax dues and electricity arrears run up by the factory, closed for almost six years.

 I shall try to bring back senior officers and technicians who left Dunlop after it was closed, said Ruia, who had a first-hand account of the situation when he visited Sahagunj to a rapturous welcome on Sunday. 

 Sen promised help in getting the factory back on rails, including the relief sought in pending electricity bills and sales tax dues. We expect him to run it effectively, professionally.

 Ruia also told the state government he was keen to wrest back Dunlop House on Mirza Ghalib Street. The building where Dunlop was based now belongs to the Pataka group, which paid Rs 10.75 crore for it. Dunlop House is a heritage building and I want it back, he added

 The new Dunlop owner claimed the unions at Sahagunj have assured him all help in re-employing 2700 workers. Ruia also said arrangements were being made to restore electricity and supply of drinking water to the staff quarters of the closed factory. I am trying to bring back the two key amenities for workers in the quarters.

 Ruia said his first job will be to resuscitate the idle machines, revive the marketing network with help from senior executives who left the organisation after its woes. 

 Carter Puller ERS 

 All 86 employees of the loss-making state government undertaking Carter Puller have agreed to accept the early retirement scheme (ERS). Also, the labour logjam at Wimcos Dakshineswar unit was broken today at a meeting between the state, unions and the company.

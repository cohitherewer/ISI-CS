 Govt to turn FDI tap on for oil refineries

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Aiyar: Welcome note

 Calcutta, March 14: The government plans to court international players as stakeholders in the domestic refining sector to forge closer ties with nations where the country is eyeing oil and gas properties.

 The ministry of petroleum and natural gas has decided to aggressively court foreign direct investment (FDI) in the refining sector, which has not seen international participation in any significant manner.

 In an exclusive interview with The Telegraph, petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said the agenda for his ministry this year would be to replicate the success of the exploration and production (E amp;P) sector, which evoked a good number of foreign interests.

 ?The E amp;P sector has taken off. I will now give special emphasis on the refining sector. There are a number of projects like Bina, Bhatinda and Allahabad that are stuck. My agenda is to push them forward this year,? Aiyar said.

 It would be in the larger interest of the country to offer foreign players a stake in the domestic downstream sector, he added.

 ?We have to build a community of common interest in the oil sector. For that we need to bring in foreign investment as well as invest abroad,? the minister said.

 The strategy will benefit the country significantly apart from close co-operation. To offset the impact of a huge oil bill, India needs to push up exports of petro products.

 ?We have to increase our export of petroleum products substantially,? Aiyar said.

 So far, only Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd (CPCL), an Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) subsidiary, has a foreign equity participation in the form of National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC).

 Projects like Bhatinda of Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) and Bina and Allahabad of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) had evoked interest among international players but none took off. 

 India?s total refining capacity is about 127 million tonnes (MT) with IOC having the largest share. It owns 10 of 18 refineries in the country. Reliance Industries comes second with the standalone Jamnagar refinery of 27 million tonnes.

 If Aiyar?s gameplan clicks, it will augur well for Bina, Bhatinda, Allahabad and the Paradip refinery of IOC. Together, they entail investments close to Rs 40,000 crore.

 ONGC is also looking at increasing the capacity of Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemical Ltd (MRPL) from 9 MT to 15 MT.

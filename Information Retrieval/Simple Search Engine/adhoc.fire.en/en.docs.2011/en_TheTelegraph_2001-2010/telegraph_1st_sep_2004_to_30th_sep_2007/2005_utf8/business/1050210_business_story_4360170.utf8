 TCS to help govt in e-governance drive

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Gupta: New horizons

 Mumbai, Feb. 9: The ministry of company affairs today launched its e-governance project by handing over the letter of award to the Tata Consultancy Services-led consortium.

 The project, which is estimated to cost around Rs 341 crore, was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs in its meeting held on February 2. 

 Company affairs minister Prem Chand Gupta said, ?This project will not only provide easy and secure online access to the services related to registration and filing throughout the country but will also improve their quality.?

 Ministry of company affairs secretary Komal Anand said it was a moment of great pride for the ministry to launch DCA21 ? the country?s largest e-governance initiative based on the public-private partnership model. DCA21 builds on the government?s vision to introduce a service-oriented approach to make the country globally competitive. The DCA21 e-governance programme will be implemented within a BOOT framework. The project timeframe would include implementation and rollout at all sites along with testing and certification. 

 During this period, fixed equated quarterly instalments would be paid to the BOOT operator by the project owner. 

 TCS managing director S. Ramadorai said, ?TCS has been a pioneer in bringing better management, control and governance by introducing a service-oriented approach in the design and delivery of government services, thereby establishing a healthy business eco system to make the country globally competitive.?

 TCS, with offices in 32 countries and development centres in 10, offers a comprehensive range of IT services in diverse industries such as banking and financial services, insurance, manufacturing, telecommunications, retail and transportation. 

 DCA21 has been conceptualised to cater to the spurt in growth in the corporate sector. From 29,874 companies in the country on April 1, 1956, the number has grown to about 6.5 lakh at present. While it took 34 years to reach a total of 2.02 lakh firms in 1990, the number has increased by 4.5 lakh in the last 14 years. 

 Realising that the administrative machinery has not been able to keep pace with this phenomenal growth in terms of delivery of services to various stakeholders, the ministry wants to address this weakness through the e-governance drive. 

 It involves rollout at all locations within 60 weeks and actual operations over a period of six years after that. The ministry targets switching over to complete e-registration and e-filing by all companies within three years. The project, once operational, would help in providing an easy e-filing system for business and industry.

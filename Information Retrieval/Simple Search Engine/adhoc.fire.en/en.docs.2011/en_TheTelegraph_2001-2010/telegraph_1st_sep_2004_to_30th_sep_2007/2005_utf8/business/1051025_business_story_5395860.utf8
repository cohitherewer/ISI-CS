 Capital call for banks

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 24: Finance minister P. Chidambaram will meet public-sector bank chiefs early next month to discuss ways to raise capital to meet the additional credit requirements of Rs 60,000 crore over five years.

 The finance ministers statement comes a day ahead of the Reserve Banks busy-season credit policy and puts the onus of increasing the capital base on banks.

 Bank credit contributes about 30 per cent to the GDP. Assuming that the economy grows at an average rate of 7 per cent, the additional credit requirement would be Rs 60,000 crore, Chidambaram said after inaugurating a network operating centre of Punjab National Bank (PNB). 

 In dynamic economies, the banking sector contributes between 50 per cent and 70 per cent to the GDP.

 Next months meeting will be held after all banks have announced second-quarter results. 

 It is a hard fact that bank capital has to be increased by Rs 60,000 crore over the next five to six years, he said.

 The finance minister dropped hints that the public sector banks put their houses in order if they want to retain the leadership position. The public sector banks have surrendered their leadership positions, which can be regained by using technology extensively and increasing the capital base. Unless we change fast enough, we cannot remain competitive, he said.

 The customer today has a wide array of choices, he added. One need not borrow from a public sector bank or, for that matter, from an Indian bank, he said.

 One of the reasons for the slow growth of public sector banks was that the management was not given sufficient autonomy to chalk out strategies. However, that is not the case now as each bank has worked out its own growth path and the government has given them appropriate autonomy.

 There are wide variations within the banking industry. We have one public sector bank, which has started using core banking solutions (CBS). On the other hand, there is a bank like PNB, which expects to extend the CBS network to 2000 branches by March 2006, he said.

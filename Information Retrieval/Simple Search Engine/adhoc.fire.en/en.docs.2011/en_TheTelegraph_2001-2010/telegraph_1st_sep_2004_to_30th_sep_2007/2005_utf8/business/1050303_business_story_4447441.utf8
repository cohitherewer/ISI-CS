The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 AllBank to cash in on star appeal

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Bank on us

 Calcutta, March 2: Allahabad Bank has firmed up plans to rope in a successful Bollywood actress of Bengali origin as the brand ambassador of the bank. The names that are doing the rounds are Rani Mukherjee and Sushmita Sen. 

 The deal will be clinched within the next three to four months. Through the brand ambassador, the bank wants to convey that even though it has its roots in Bengal, it is doing business successfully in other parts of the country. 

 Using Bollywood stars in the banking sector is not new. Earlier, ICICI Bank had appointed Big B as its brand ambassador. ICICI Bank feels that the promotional campaigns with Big B yielded satisfactory results. 

 Allahabad Bank chairman and managing director O. N. Singh said, ?We plan to promote our bank. However, it is premature to talk about it.? 

 However, Singh shared the growth plans of the bank. He said with the Union finance minister P. Chidambaram relaxing the takeover norms for public sector banks, Allahabad Bank will now look for ?higher synergies? in a private sector counterpart in the south.

 Elaborating his merger plans, Singh said, ?We are quite strong in the west. We have 90 branches in Maharashtra and 30 in Gujarat. But we are not aggressively present in the south, where we have 60?65 branches. Therefore, we are planning to expand our base in the south, which is a potential area for retail credit takeoff.? 

 The bank will appoint a consultant to carry out a due diligence on the south-based private counterpart it is eyeing, after its second public issue. 

 Singh expects that the Securities and Exchange Board of India will clear the draft red herring prospectus by the middle of March. The issue of 10 crore shares of Rs 10 each with a premium, which will be decided through the book-building method, will hit the market on April 12, Singh said. Market expectations place the price band in the region of Rs 65-Rs 70. 

 Singh said the bank expects to earn a net profit of Rs 600 crore in the current fiscal and bring down the non-performing asset to 1.64 per cent of the total advances. The NPA coverage of the bank is 77 per cent. 

 AllBank Finance 

 AllBank Finance, a 100 per cent subsidiary of Allahabad Bank, has decided to provide advisory service for mergers and acquisitions. Ernst amp; Young will submit a report on the subsidiary?s growth strategy. The other services that it will offer are merchant banking, apprising state loans and syndication. ?We are formulating a manpower policy for it and we want to develop it into an additional profit centre,? Singh said.

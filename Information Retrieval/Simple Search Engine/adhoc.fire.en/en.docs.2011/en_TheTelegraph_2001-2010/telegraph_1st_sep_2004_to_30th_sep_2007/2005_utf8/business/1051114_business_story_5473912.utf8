 Tarmac Asia for global take-off

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 13: With the air routes connecting China, India and the West Asian countries, the global aviation sector is set to bounce back to its growth trajectory shaking off the shackles tying it down for a few years now.

 Among the individual countries, Polands international traffic is expected to grow at the fastest rate of 11.2 per cent, followed closely by the China (9.6 per cent) and Czech Republic (9.5 per cent).

 The rebound in passenger traffic growth in September is a welcome surprise. Unfortunately, it is likely to be temporary. The continued slowing down in freight volumes indicates that high oil prices are taking a toll on economic activities. It is only a matter of time before the trend is reflected in passenger volumes, too, said Giovanni Bisignani, IATAs director general and chief executive officer.

 Bisignanis remark came with the IATA release of passenger and freight traffic forecasts for 2005-2009. The forecast was a 5.6 per cent average annual growth rate for international passengers and a 6.3 per cent for freight tonnage. 

 IATA pointed out that the international passenger growth would come from the routes within Asia-Pacific, which expect a 6.8 per cent average annual growth rate largely on the back of economic expansion and market liberalisation in China and India. Within Europe, traffic growth forecast has been pegged at 5.1 per cent average annual growth rate, though the same for the Central and Eastern Europe routes has been made at 5.1 per cent. The Central and Eastern Europe routes are expected to grow at a faster pace than in Western Europe.

 Air transport is critical to the global economy, said Bisignani. We generate 29 million jobs globally with a revenue generation exceeding $2.9 trillion. Our growth prospects are clear, but profitability remains illusive. With $36 billion in losses between 2001 and 2004, and another $7.4 billion expected for 2005, the global aviation industry is in need of massive turnaround.

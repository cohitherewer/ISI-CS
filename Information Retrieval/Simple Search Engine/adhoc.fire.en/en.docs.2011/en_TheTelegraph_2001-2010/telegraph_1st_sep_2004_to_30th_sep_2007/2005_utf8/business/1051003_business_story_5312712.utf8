 Taking into account

 Keep a check on your savings account transactions, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 Spend, spend, spend... That?s the voice-over during these festive times. This is when you splurge on clothes, travel and eat out. 

 You must be spending too. But are you reaching out for your credit or debit card or popping into an ATM counter every time you need to replenish the fast-depleting kitty? 

 Beware, too many transactions on your savings bank account may prove costly. 

 Your bank may not tell you that there are limits to the number of free transactions on a savings account during a given period of time, say a year or six months or a quarter. Once you top that limit, there will be a fee for every additional withdrawal and deposit to your account.

 Penny pinch

 The fee is not a trifle either ? it ranges between Rs 5 and Rs 60 per transaction from bank to bank.

 Just add the number of payments you have made through cheques, ECS and debit card, the number of times you have withdrawn cash from your bank?s ATM. If the total turns out to be more than 50 in a quarter (or four in a week), you are on the wrong side. 

 High price

 The State Bank of India deducts Rs 55 from your savings account for every transaction over above the 50 permitted for each quarter. ?These transactions include both credit and debit entries (read deposits and withdrawals). In fact, with the use of cards, the number of transactions per savings account has increased significantly. But, after all, it?s a savings account, not a current account ? people tend to forget this,? an SBI official said. 

 State-run Bank of Baroda (BoB) has recently lifted the limit from the credit (or deposit) entries to a savings account.

 ?A savings account holder in BoB can deposit money any number of times without paying a service charge. But there is a limit to debit entries or withdrawals ? it is 100 half-yearly. Beyond that every debit entry is charged at Rs 12,? said BoB chief manager Ashok S. Joshi.

 ?These 100 withdrawals include all debit transactions ? cheque withdrawals, debit card, ECS and credit card payments,? he added.

 ?For cheque withdrawals, 40 transactions are free in a year. Beyond that, the account holder will have to pay Rs 2.50 for each cheque leaf,? he said.

 Other public sector banks also levy such charges. 

 By another name

 And they are not the only ones. Their peers in the private sector also levy similar charges, but they put it differently. 

 ?Till the account holder maintains an average quarterly balance of Rs 5,000, he or she is free to do any number of transactions. But we discourage account holders from misusing this and pursue them to switch to current accounts if they really need to do more transactions than is normal in a savings account,? said a manager with ICICI Bank.

 ?If the average quarterly balance, which is calculated as the sum total of daily balances (deposits net of withdrawals) for 90 days divided by 90, goes below Rs 5,000, there is a quarterly deduction of Rs 750 for non-maintenance of minimum balance. In addition to this, there is a service charge of Rs 60 per transaction if it is done at the branch and Rs 30 if done at an ATM. However, three transactions, including both deposit and withdrawal, are free during a quarter,? an HDFC Bank official said.

 Convenience comes with a cost. So, use your plastic money wisely.

 Verizon set to hang up on directory business

 KEN BELSON

 New York, Dec. 5: Verizon Communications said on Sunday that it was considering whether to sell or spin off its directory business so it can concentrate more on providing wireless, data and phone services.

 Verizons board has authorised the company, the second-largest telecommunications carrier after AT amp;T, to hire bankers to explore its options now that its purchase of MCI is almost complete. The company could sell or spin off the directories group, Verizon Information Services, in 2006.

 This is the right time for us to take action that helps us sharpen our focus on our three network-based businesses, said Peter Thonis, a Verizon spokesman. This move will give them additional flexibility to manoeuvre in a fast-moving marketplace.

 Verizon Information Services publishes 1,750 directories in 44 states and Washington. The division also operates SuperPages.com, which it says is the nations largest online yellow pages. The division generated $3.6 billion in revenue and $1.7 billion in profit before taxes and other charges last year, and it employs 7,300 people. Sales fell 5.7 per cent last year, and they may slip an additional 2.4 per cent this year, according to the investment firm Sanford C. Bernstein.

 Directory businesses are typically more profitable than many other divisions at phone companies like Verizon because they require far less investment in equipment. Automation and revenue from Web sites have also improved profitability for phone companies. Qwest Communications, the smallest of the four big Bell operating companies, sold its directory business for $7 billion in August 2002.

 Verizon has hired Bear, Stearns amp; Co and JP Morgan Securities as its financial advisers.

 The justice department and the Federal Communications Commission, as well as two dozen states, have already approved Verizons purchase of MCI, the countrys second-largest provider of telecommunications services to corporations.

 Regulators in five states must still give their approval, which Verizon expects as early as the end of the year.

 In addition to concentrating more of its energy on its core businesses, Verizon is trying to reassure investors, who have seen the companys stock fall 21 per cent this year.

 Calcutta, Aug. 16: Upper Ganges Sugar and Industries Limited (UGSIL), a KK Birla group company, will come out with a rights issue of Rs 70 crore. 

 The fund will be utilised to augment the long-term working capital of the company, said C.S. Nopany, director, UGSIL.

 The pricing and the ratio of the issue will be determined at a later date, mentioned Nopany. However, the whole exercise will be completed by the end of this year, he added.

 The company had last offered a rights issue in 1995 in the ratio of two shares for every share held mopping up Rs 9.30 crore. 

 Upper Ganges Sugar plans an expansion drive doubling its ethanol capacity from 55 kilo-litre per day to 110 klpd. The company is also mulling to take up various co-generation projects at its existing facilities and set up a green-field sugar factory, too.

 We are currently in the process of finalising the various aspects of the expansion plan and have received several letters of intent from project executors. The company will make a decision within the next 30 days, mentioned Nopany. 

 He added that UGSIL has been looking for a suitable site in Uttar Pradesh for the new sugar factory. The project will be operational within the next 14 months. 

 The new plant will have a crushing capacity of 7,000 tonnes per day (tcd), which will take the total capacity of the company to 23,000 tcd. However, this includes the 2,200-tcd capacity of New India Sugar Mills, a group company, which is in the process of being merged with UGSIL. 

 The scheme of arrangement is lying before the high courts of Calcutta and Allahabad.

 The KK Birla group has two other sugar companies in its fold, namely Oudh Sugar Mills and Govind Sugar Mills. The groups total crushing capacity is 40,000 tcd and distillery capacity of 130 klpd.

 Oudh Sugar Mills has also undertaken a rights issue to raise Rs 39 crore. The company will further expand its crushing capacity from 7,500 tcd to 10,000 tcd. It will also double its distillery capacity from the current 65 klpd, mentioned Nopany.

 Govind Mills, which currently has a crushing capacity of 6,500 tcd, will look at further expansion next year.

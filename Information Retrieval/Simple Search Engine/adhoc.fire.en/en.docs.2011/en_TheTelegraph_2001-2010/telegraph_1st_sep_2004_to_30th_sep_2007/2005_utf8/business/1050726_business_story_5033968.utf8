 New Wipro sales head for America

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, July 25: Wipro Ltd has appointed P.R. Chandrasekhar to head its sales operations in the Americas and Europe ? two key regions accounting for 92 per cent of its market.

 Chandrasekhar, who was the chief executive officer of the European operations, has been given the charge of the Americas as well after CEO Rich Garnick put in his papers. Garnick has resigned less than a month after the exit of vice-chairman and CEO Vivek Paul, who will join the US-based Texas Pacific Group, a global private investment fund. Pauls exit was announced on June 30.

 Chandrasekhar, known as Sekar in the organisation, will report to chairman Azim Premji.

 Sekars ability to create a win-win situation is enhanced by his prior experience in the Americas and Europe. We have more and more clients across multiple geographies, and having a common head for Europe and the Americas will align us better with this trend. quot; Premji said.

 Under Chandrasekhars leadership, Wipros European operations had grown, driven by key deals, better client interactions and a new strategic consulting unit. 

 Earlier, Chandrasekhar was responsible for global merger and acquisition, channel development and the .Net business. 

 He also had a successful sales stint in Wipro GE Medical Systems.

 Rich Garnick, head of Wipros America sales, has resigned after four years with the company. Rich has contributed to building our sales engine in North America. We wish him success in his future endeavours, Premji said.

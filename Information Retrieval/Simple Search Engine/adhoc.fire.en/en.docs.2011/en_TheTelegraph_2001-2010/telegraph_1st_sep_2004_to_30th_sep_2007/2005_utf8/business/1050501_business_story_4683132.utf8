 Pay cut for GM chairman

 Wagoner: Fight is on

 Detroit, April 30 (Reuters): Cash compensation paid to General Motors chairman and chief executive officer Rick Wagoner fell by 43 per cent last year, as its automotive operations lost money on weaker US sales and market share.

 GM, the world?s largest auto maker, also said in a securities filing on Friday that cash compensation paid to its top five executive officers fell 37 per cent last year versus 2003.

 GM?s net earnings fell to $2.8 billion last year from $3.8 billion previously, due in part to a $886-million after-tax payment to Italy?s Fiat SpA to dissolve a failed industrial partnership. Including that payout, GM?s automotive unit posted a loss of $89 million versus a profit of $995 million in 2003.

 GM recalled more than 11 million vehicles in 2004, a record for the auto maker. GM?s US sales fell about 1.1 per cent last year, cutting its US market share to about 27.3 per cent for 2004 from 28 per cent in 2003, according to Autodata.

 Wagoner?s cash compensation last year fell to $4.8 million from $8.5 million in 2003. He also received options for 400,000 GM shares valued at $5.1 million. In 2003, the company granted him options for 500,000 shares valued at $4.3 million at the time they were granted.

 The company didnt pay any long-term incentives to GM executives last year because the shares failed to hit a company target.

 The Detroit auto maker?s fortunes have worsened this year. Earlier this month, GM posted a first-quarter loss of $1.1 billion, including a loss of $1.56 billion in North America alone, its worst quarterly result since it skirted bankruptcy in 1992.

 GMs financial deterioration has caused its shares to drop sharply, and ratings agencies to warn that it could downgrade the auto makers debt to ?junk? status at any time.

 Earlier in April, Wagoner took day-to-day control of GMs North American automotive operations from two deputies, a move analysts said puts his job on the line as he tries to turn around the money-losing business.

 Also in the securities filing on Friday, shareholders have submitted five proposals to be considered at the GM annual meeting to be held in June.

 Nokia eyes co-branding 

 Helsinki, Sept. 18 (PTI): Nokia is in talks with Indian moblie service providers, including Reliance, for co-branding of handsets.

 The worlds largest mobile phone maker had announced at the GSM World Congress Mobile Phone Trade Fair in Cannes in Feburary that it was willing to go in for co-branding.

 We are talking to major players in the operator community, including Reliance, for co-branding of handsets, Heikki Norta, senior vice-president (marketing), mobile phones, Nokia, said.

 He said, While negotiating on co-branding, talks normally focus on how the operators name would appear on handsets, how it is manifested in packaging and points of sale, and how the handset functions. All these points are being negotiated in the Reliance deal, Norta said.

 He said the success enjoyed by Nokia in India has been due to the fact that the company has understood differences.

 Going forward we will have interface on mobile phone in 10 Indian languages, Norta added.

 He said the companys mobile phone manufacturing plant, coming up in Chennai, would initially cater to the Indian market and it would be capable of manufacturing all models of handsets.

 Norta said by 2010, mobile phones around the world would go up to 3 billion and would cross 2 billion by end of 2005.

 He said there was consolidation happening in the mobile phone market globally with the market share of top three players going up at the cost of smaller players, who are gradually losing the market.

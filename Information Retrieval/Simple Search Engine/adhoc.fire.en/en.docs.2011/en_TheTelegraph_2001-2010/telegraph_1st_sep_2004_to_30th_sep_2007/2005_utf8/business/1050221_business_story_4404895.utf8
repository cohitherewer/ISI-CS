 Yukos tilts to China, ONGC on the fringe

 S. P. S. PANNU 

 High stakes

 New Delhi, Feb. 20: India appears to be out of the race for a stake in the giant oilfield of Yukos in Russia as the Chinese offer of a $6-billion medium-term loan in exchange for assured crude supplies provides a better deal for the Russians.

 India, on the other hand, has informed the Russians that a purely loan-based deal does not suit ONGC-Videsh (OVL) as the geographical distance and location of the oilfield would make it uneconomical to bring the oil back home.

 While ONGC-Videsh had initially offered $2 billion for a 15 per cent stake in the oilfield, it was ready to increase the bid to $6 billion to match the Chinese. OVL was ready to go in for a deal on the lines of Sakhalin I, where it had paid for a 20 per cent stake and extended a loan to the Russian company Rosneft to develop the field. However, the Russians are not willing to play ball this time as the Chinese offer is far better. It gives the Russians the required cash without parting with a share in the valuable oilfield.

 ?India is not a neighbour of Russia and deals based on loans against crude supplies are suitable only for countries which can easily evacuate the product,? petroleum secretary S. C. Tripathi had said.

 He admitted that at this point, there are no indications from the Russians for offering OVL a share in the Yukos company?s Yuganz oilfield. It was quite evident that the response from the Russians is lukewarm.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar had said that ?discussions are still open with the Russians on the issue and there is no full stop.? He will be leaving for Moscow on Sunday night. The main purpose of his visit is to woo Russian oil and gas companies to join in the Indian oil hunt in the blocks being offered under the Fifth Round of the New Exploration Licensing Policy.

 He will be exploring other opportunities for OVL in Russia, which include the Vankor oilfield. Talks for this deal are under way. 

 OVL has signed a confidentiality agreement with Rosneft to carry out negotiations on the field. The Sakhalin 3 field is another area OVL is interested in.

 The truth is that while the Russians are looking for investment, their economy is in much better shape than what it was when the Sakhalin I deal was struck. 

 The price of oil has shot up more than $10 per barrel since then and the value of Russian oilfields has also escalated.

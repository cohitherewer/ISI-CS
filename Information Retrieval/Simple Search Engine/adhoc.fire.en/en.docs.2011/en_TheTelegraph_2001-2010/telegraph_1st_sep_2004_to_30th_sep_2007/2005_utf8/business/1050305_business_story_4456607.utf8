 Govt review plea in ITC case spiked

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 4: The Supreme Court has rejected the review petition filed by the Union government last October that sought to collect Rs 803 crore from ITC Ltd in excise dues. 

 The court decision, however, becomes irrelevant in view of the ordinance issued by the government in January.

 The ordinance tweaked excise laws retrospectively to force the Calcutta-based cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate to pay the unpaid amount arising from a case that goes back to 1983. 

 A claim of Rs 803 crore had been made on the ground that ITC had sold cigarettes at a price higher than the maximum retail price printed on the packets.

 Last September, ITC had come out triumphant from a bruising legal battle when the Supreme Court struck down the Rs 803-crore excise tab.

 The government filed the review petition immediately after that.

 Baidu sizzles on US debut

 Big day

 New York, Aug. 6 (Reuters): Shares of Chinas largest Web search company, Baidu.com Inc., more than quadrupled in value in their US market debut on Friday in the most spectacular entry ever by a foreign company, overshadowing world search leader Google Inc.s float last year. 

 The meteoric debut of the Beijing-based firm was reminiscent of the Internet heyday, when shares of new online and technology companies routinely trebled on their first trading day. 

 The Chinese firms float, with its irresistible mix of China and the Internet, sparked huge interest globally, with the company described as a potential Chinese Google well placed to serve the worlds most populous country, where Web use is surging. 

 But even analysts expecting a strong debut were stunned as Baidu.com shares more than quadrupled the $27 per American Depository Share (ADS) pricing of its initial public offering, the first US listing of a pure-play Chinese search engine. 

 Its just been amazing. It could be over-enthusiasm, it could be the way Google charted, but there is obviously a lot of speculative buyers who think this could be an Asian Google, said Sal Morreale, who tracks IPOs for Cantor Fitzgerald. Baidu.com shares surged over 450 per cent to a high of $151.21 during intra-day trading on Nasdaq on Friday. They closed almost 354 per cent up at $122.54. 

 A list of market debuts compiled by Dealogic showed this was the biggest one-day gain by a foreign company in the United States and the largest gain of any company in five years. 

 Baidu had its ADS priced at $27 late Thursday, having a day earlier raised its indicative price range to $23-$25 a share from $19-$21 amid strong investor demand. It also raised its offering size to 4.04 million ADS from 3.7 million. 

 Comparisons between Baidu.com and Google ? which owns 2.6 per cent of the Chinese company ? generated strong interest in the offering, which raised about $109 million and valued the 5-year-old company at $872 million. 

 Expectations for the listing the company were high since Googles share price has more than tripled since it went public a year ago. 

 Baidu.coms market capitalisation quickly soared to about $4 billion as its stock rocketed. But its still only a fraction of Googles market value of about $82 billion.

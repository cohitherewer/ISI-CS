 Demand for used PCs grows 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: The market for used personal computers is gaining ground around the globe and will continue to grow for years to come, says the analyst firm Gartner.

 A survey done by the company on used PC market worldwide says, for every two new personal computers shipped to developed countries in 2005, one secondary PC is resold.

 A secondary PC, as defined by Gartner, is a computer that has been in use for more than three months and then made available to another user.

 The study also says that at present one in 12 PCs in use worldover are secondary PCs. In 2004, as many as 152.5 million assembled PCs were shipped and an estimated 36 per cent of them or 55 million units were dedicated to reuse.

 It is these secondary machines which will provide a strong base from which the used PC market will grow, the study comments.

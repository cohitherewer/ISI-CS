 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Jan. 12: Tata Power is keen to set up a 500-MW power plant in Bengal. The company also wants to foray into the distribution sector in the state.

 Bengal commerce and industry department sources said Tata group supremo Ratan Tata had preliminary talks with Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, power minister Mrinal Banerjee and commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen on the proposed project.

 ?We are keen to set up a generating plant in Bengal. We may go alone or with a joint venture partner. We also want to enter the distribution sector. We are currently discussing ways to implement our future growth plans,? Tata Power managing director Firdose Vandrevala told The Telegraph on the sidelines of the 11th CII Partnership Summit here today.

 The total investment for the power plant will be Rs 1,500-Rs 2,000 crore.

 The company has an installed power generation capacity of 2278 MW at the thermal power station at Trombay and the hydro electric power units at Bhira, Bhivpuri and Khopoli. 

 There has been an increase in sales in the Mumbai licence area as the company expanded its network and customer base.

 A substantial quantum is supplied to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, while maintaining assured power supply to the metro?s railway network, refineries, ports, and other organisations. 

 Regarding the Maithon Right Bank project, Vandrevala said, ?Tata Power will have a 51 per cent stake and Damodar Valley Corporation 49 per cent in the proposed joint venture. The proposal has been sent to the power ministry and its approval is awaited.?

 Tata Power has also entered into the renewable energy segment. It has commissioned a 17-MW wind power project at Supa near Ahmednagar in Maharashtra.

 Fitch cautions polyester makers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 19: While cotton yarn makers are rejoicing over a bumper cotton crop that has resulted in low raw material prices, the countrys polyester manufacturers are heading for hard times. The synthetic segment, marred by high crude oil prices, is now apprehending a possible shift in textile consumption to cotton.

 According to a report by Fitch Ratings, its not only in crude oil prices ? the basic raw material from which variety of petrochemicals are produced ? where the polyester manufacturers are facing the pinch, their margins are also under pressure from increasing competition. The rating agency has estimated that more than 1 million tonnes per annum of new polyester fibre/yarn capacity would go on stream in the country between 2006 and 2008.

 Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is the market leader in the polyester fibre/yarn segment and the other players include Indo Rama Synthetics and Bombay Dyeing, a new entrant. According to Fitch, the capacity in the pipeline is massive considering the current base of about 1.6 million tonnes and this may prove out-of-proportion comparing with the demand, which is growing only at 4 per cent annually since 2000. A combination of over-capacities and subdued demand may lead to pressure on polyester margins in the future, Fitch warned.

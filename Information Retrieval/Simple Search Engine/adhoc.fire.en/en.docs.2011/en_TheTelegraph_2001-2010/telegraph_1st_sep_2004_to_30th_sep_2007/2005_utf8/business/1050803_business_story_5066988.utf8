The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Balmer Lawries five-year plan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 2: Balmer Lawrie amp; Co has chalked out a strategic plan for the next five years.

 Managing director S. K. Mukherjee said the management has worked out a corporate plan on its own and the board approved it on July 28.

 The company, which has nine businesses ? five in the manufacturing sector and four in services ? was on the divestment list till recently.

 The UPA government struck it off the list in February this year, following which the company started working on this plan.

 We will seek an external view from consultants. After accommodating the view, the board will put the plan into action, Mukherjee told The Telegraph.

 The consultant opinion is expected in the next 2-3 months.

 Under the plan, the company will look at the viability of its businesses in a changing environment and offer measures to strengthen them.

 The company could even hive off some of its operations if they were not profitable in the long term.

 Mukherjee, however, declined to give the details of the plan.

 In the past, the company had tried to restructure its operations by defining core and outer-core businesses and inducting a joint venture partner for the latter.

 Leather performance chemicals, container freight stations, tours and tea blending and exports were identified as outer-core businesses.

 However, no headway was made on this as the NDA government put it on the block.

 The corporate plan, however, has not classified businesses in core, outer-core and value destroying categories.

 However, Mukherjee said the company would explore all the options, including hiving off, to restructure business.

 Apart from tea, no other business has been perennially loss-making.

 Industrial packaging made profit last year, while grease and lubricant, a core business of Balmer Lawrie, slipped into the red due to high base oil prices. 

 The leather chemical business turned around last year, while the manufacturing unit of speciality containers made a small profit.

 In the service sector units, the project engineering division suffered loss due to lack of orders. 

 However, the situation is better this fiscal with a strong order book situation.

 Meanwhile, the companys stock leapt to Rs 369 on Tuesday before cooling off to Rs 366.10, up by Rs 19.60 or 5.66 per cent on the National Stock Exchange.

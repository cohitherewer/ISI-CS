 Vinod Doshi: Making room

 Mumbai, July 13: Vinod L. Doshi will relinquish his responsibilities as executive chairman of Premier Ltd (formerly Premier Automobiles Ltd) in favour of Maitreya Doshi, managing director. 

 Vinod Doshi will now focus his attention on planning broader strategies for Premier, which has positioned itself as a vehicle, machine tools and engineering company. He will, however, continue to serve as the non-executive chairman.

 Vinod Doshi, who has been the executive chairman of the company since 1984, has been appointed as an adviser/consultant for three years. He will be paid a fee of Rs 30,000 per day (not exceeding four days per month). His travelling, lodging and boarding expenses will be borne by the company.

 Premier had posted a profit of Rs 11 crore for the year ended March 31 compared with Rs 65.74 lakh in the previous year. Its vehicles were commercially launched in the last quarter of 2004. These included multi-utility van Sigma and pick-up van Roadstar. According to the company, customer response to the vehicles have been encouraging. 

 Premier plans to put a nationwide sales, spares and service network with 50 dealers in place by this fiscal.

 The machine tool operations of the company, which is its mainstay, include designing, developing, servicing and offering complete engineering solutions to a wide range of clients like auto ancillary manufacturers, defence, railways and public sector undertakings. The order book position at the beginning of this year was put around Rs 35 crore.

 According to Premiers annual report for 2004-05, it has come back to the dividend list after a gap of six years due to the right combination of product mix.

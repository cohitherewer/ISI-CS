 Welspun weaves capacity rejig plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Sept. 1: Welspun India Ltd today announced a Rs 650-crore expansion programme to augment the production of terry towels, bed-sheets as well as increase the capacity of the spinning facilities. It will also utilise the fund to venture into the new product line of decorative bedding.

 The company said it would be raising the money through a mix of debt and equity, adding that no equity dilution would be required to fund the expansion project.

 While Welspun has already raised Rs 165 crore through equity/warrants, close to Rs 85 crore will come from internal accruals and the remaining Rs 400 crore will be raised under the textile upgradation fund that carries an interest rate of 3 per cent per annum.

 The move is part of the companys strategy to exploit the business opportunity thrown open by the lifting of quotas from the beginning of this year. Along with this, the rising demand in home textiles globally and the shrinking base of the US and European textile manufacturers offer an unique opportunity, which Welspun is planning to capitalise.

 The expansion project will come next to its existing Anjar facility in Gujarat. Welspun will increase the weaving capacity of terry towels by 10,000 tonnes annually. Similarly, it will spruce up the weaving of bed-sheets by 30 million metres.

 To match the increase in towels and bed-sheets and to reduce dependence on outside sources for cotton yarn, the company will also augment cotton yarn production at the Anjar factory from 25,000 spindles to 50,000 spindles. 

 Regarding its foray into decorative bedding, Welspun said it perceives a high demand in the decorative bedding market, especially in the US, due to the closure of big textile manufacturers.

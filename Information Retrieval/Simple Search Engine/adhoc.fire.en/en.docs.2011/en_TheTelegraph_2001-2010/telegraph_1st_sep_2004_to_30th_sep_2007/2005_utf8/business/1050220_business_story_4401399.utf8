 Oriental Bank gets go-ahead for mega flotation

 Narang: Upbeat

 New Delhi, Feb. 19 (PTI): Oriental Bank of Commerce will go for a second public offering to raise about Rs 2,000 crore any time after March 15, its chairman B. D. Narang announced today.

 ?We received the approval from the finance ministry yesterday,? Narang said, adding the public offer, through the book-building process, will be for 5.8 crore new shares.

 This will bring down government equity in the bank by 15 per cent to 51 per cent from the present 66 per cent, he said at an interactive session with the ?Forum of financial writers?.

 Narang ruled out any buy-back of shares by the government. Nor is there any plan to raise tier-II capital, he added.

 Going by the current price of the OBC scrip, ruling at about Rs 308, the offer of 5.8 crore shares should fetch over Rs 1,800 crore.

 ?The timing of the offer would depend on the approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and if the due-diligence process takes three weeks we will be ready to hit the market anytime after March 15,? Narang said. 

 Oriental Bank is raising the capital to meet its business needs and comply with the stringent Basel-II norms by 2006.

 The bank targets to increase its business (deposits and loans) to over Rs 1,00,000 crore by the end of March 2006.

 The bank had earlier set a target of Rs 80,000-crore business by the end of this fiscal from Rs 55,000 crore in 2003-04, which subsequently rose to Rs 65,000 crore after the merger of Global Trust Bank.

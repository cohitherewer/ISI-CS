 Bonanza for ICICI Bank credit card users

 Calcutta, Aug. 5: The credit card battle rages on.

 In a trend-setting move, ICICI Bank has waived the annual fee on all its credit cards, except co-branded cards with Deccan Air and Kingfisher Airlines.

 ?The waiver is not only for new customers but also for our existing 3.5 million credit card holders,? said Chanda Kochhar, executive director of ICICI Bank.

 Who would bear the expenses that the bank incurs for issuing and servicing the cards? Kochhar did not divulge the extent of the loss, but said, ?We will bear the total expenses and expect that it will be compensated by an increased volume and per customer use.?

 ?This is one of the biggest initiatives in the credit card industry since its inception. As market leaders, we strive for growth and this is a step in that direction. We also believe that this decision will widen the market and help the industry make deeper inroads in this segment, which has a huge growth potential,? she added.

 Other banks have adopted a cautious approach on the move. HDFC Bank officials have declined to comment on the ground that it is not possible to evaluate the move till the related details regarding the terms and conditions are available.

 Other major banks hold a similar stance.

 A private bank official cited the example of the Standard Chartered Manhattan Card. ?In principle, it is also a free-for-life card and is positioned accordingly. However, a customer has to fulfil certain criteria to avail of that benefit,? he reasoned. Therefore, it is important to be aware of all the associated terms and conditions and hidden costs, if any, he added.

 A State Bank of India official said, ?We have no plans to follow suit or change the current fee structure of our credit cards as we believe in transparency. So till the time a clearer picture emerges, we will not announce any move.?

 Kochhar, however, clarified the complaints of hidden costs.

 ?The whole offer is extremely simple and clear. A customer does not need to pay any fees such as membership, one-time or any such subsequent charges. One is just required to pay the applicable transaction charges and the rate of interest on revolving credit,? she said.

 Also, there are no terms and conditions attached to the offer such as spending a minimum sum on the card, she added. ICICI Bank dethroned Citibank as the number one card issuer in India in January. Citibank, with a credit card base of 2.7 million, has been left way behind by ICICI Bank with nearly 3.5 million credit card holders. The industry has a total customer base of 1.4 crore. 

 ICICI Bank has a 25 per cent share in the total spend of Rs 2,000 crore per month on credit cards issued by all banks.

 ?While the market is growing at 25 per cent, we are definitely growing faster,? said Kochhar. Last year, the bank?s credit card users grew at almost 50 per cent.

 Merger laurel for DSP Merrill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 5: DSP Merrill Lynch has bagged top honours in advising companies on mergers and acquisitions.

 The rankings have been made in Bloomberg League Tables, which indicate that the growing number of acquisitions and mergers is a trend that will continue for sometime.

 DSP Merrill helped forge 19.4 per cent of all deals in India, pocketing $1,400 million (Rs 6300 crore) from nine transactions. Rival Citigroup took second spot, with a tally of $998 million (Rs 4491 crore) from just three deals. It had a market share of 13.8 per cent. The third place went to ICICI Securities, which had a share of 8.1 per cent from nine deals worth $589 million (Rs 2650 crore).

 ?DSP Merrill Lynch?s top ranking by Bloomberg underlines the strength of our franchise and is a recognition of the value that we bring to our clients. This year has been significant in terms of size, complexity and nature of deals. It indicates a widening of the M amp;A landscape over last year,? said Amit Chandra, joint managing director of DSP Merrill Lynch Limited.

 More deals are expected in the months ahead, as Indian companies consolidate at home and mount acquisitions abroad. Investment bankers say the trend will be more pronounced in banks, infotech and automobiles. The boom in the primary market will also keep their cash registers ringing and deal-books overflowing.

 In recent weeks, Bharat Forge was in the news for acquiring a company in the US. Within a week, its rival, Amtek, forged the buyout of a European ancillary firm. Eicher Motors? acquisition of Design Intent last week and Amco Batteries? sale of 50 per cent to a French firm were the other big deals. Barings is looking to sell shares in MphasiS in a deal expected over the next few months. Efforts to restart Dabhol Power Company have also drawn hordes of investment bankers hungry for fat fees.

 Sources in the industry say the recent acquisition of Shaw Wallace amp; Company by UB will see investment bankers sniffing around amid signs that Vijay Mallya could flog some brands of the one-time Manu Chhabria company. UB itself could uncork a few foreign brand buyouts.

 United Breweries? grand plan to create a spirits monolith by merging McDowell, Shaw Wallace, Herbertsons and TDV in the second half of this year will throw up a big opportunity for merger specialists too. DSP Merrill Lynch is one of the leading investment banking and securities companies in India.

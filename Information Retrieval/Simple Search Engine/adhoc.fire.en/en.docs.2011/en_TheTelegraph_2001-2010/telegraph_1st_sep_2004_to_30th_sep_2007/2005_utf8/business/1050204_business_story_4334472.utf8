 Nath finds foreigners? appetite growing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nath: Upbeat

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: Commerce minister Kamal Nath said today that India had figured more strongly than China on the ?radar screen? of prospective foreign investors at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos.

 An upbeat Nath said while China had been attracting more foreign investment than India, it was now being increasingly felt that the proportion of profitable investments in India were much higher than China. 

 ?While 77 per cent of foreign direct investments in India were making money, only 20 per cent of the FDI was profitable in China,? he added.

 The minister said the crucial difference between the two countries was that India had a larger domestic market than China that the companies could tap. Foreign companies investing in China, however, had to depend mainly on exports for their profit. He said there were 400 million people in India who had adequate purchasing power to provide a strong demand for goods produced in the country. ?Studies carried out by financial consultants have revealed that China is a high-investment but low-returns country,? he added.

 He claimed that the growing impression worldwide was that the Chinese economy had overheated. This had put the Chinese on the defensive at Davos, he said. 

 He said FDI flows into India in the current financial year ending March 31, 2005 were expected to go up to $15 billion compared with $5.6 billion last year.

 Nath admitted that India was seen as a country with poor infrastructure as a result of which foreign investors had fought shy of investing in the country.

 However, he claimed that the scope for profitable investment in the development of infrastructure had now emerged as a new opportunity for investors. 

 The policies of the government were geared to making investment in the infrastructure more attractive and major FDI flows were expected in this sector.

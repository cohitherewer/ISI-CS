The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Graphite to shop for funds 

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Aug. 19: The Bangur group-owned Graphite India Ltd is planning to mobilise over Rs 125 crore to meet its capital expenditure requirement. 

 The companys board will meet next week to decide on the modalities of the fund-raising programme and chalk out the future business plan.

 Graphite chairman K.K. Bangur said the board would ultimately decide on the amount and how it would be raised. I cannot comment on how much the company will raise, Bangur told The Telegraph.

 However, market sources said that it could be in excess of Rs 125 crore.

 Bangur said the company was considering many options, including private placement of shares and an overseas issue like GDR/ADR. The funds would be utilised for business expansion and acquisitions.

 Graphite India has bought a German company recently and it is looking for more such takeover opportunities. 

 Bangur, however, clarified that there was no binding offer before the company at present. We are looking at opportunities both in India and abroad, he added.

 Graphite India has embarked on a mega expansion drive at its local as well as German facility.

 The company plans to increase the capacity of graphite products at its local facility to 60,000 tonnes in India from the current level of 40,000 tonnes.

 It will also double the capacity at the newly-acquired German facility to 20,000 tonnes.

 Graphite India will spend around Rs 160 crore on its domestic plants and another Rs 20 crore on the Germany factory.

 The capacity expansion at the local facility will be completed by the end of this year while the German expansion will be finalised within the next three months. 

 The development comes at a time when graphite product prices are rising.

 Graphite India has already booked it production till December at $2,500 a tonne. However, in the spot market, graphite is quoting at $4,000 a tonne.

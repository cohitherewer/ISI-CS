 Big push to call-carrier selection 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 11: The telecom regulator today issued letters to all service providers seeking a report on the status of the implementation of carrier selection on their respective networks.

 This is a prerequisite for allowing individual subscribers to select a domestic long-distance operator of their choice from a single instrument. In the UK, the subscriber can choose the STD operator by pressing a specific colour on fixed-line phones. 

 This allows the customer to use a network that offers low cost on a particular day or at a particular time. 

 In 2002, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India had issued a direction regarding the implementation of call-by-call and carrier-pre selection facility. At that time, Bharat Sanchar Nigam could not handle this kind of billing and, hence, the DoT had relaxed the implementation of call-by-call selection or pre-selection on BSNL network for 12 months.

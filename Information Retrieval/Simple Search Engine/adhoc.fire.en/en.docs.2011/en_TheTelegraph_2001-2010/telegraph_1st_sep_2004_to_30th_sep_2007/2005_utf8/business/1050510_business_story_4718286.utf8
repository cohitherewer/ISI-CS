 Calcutta, May 9: Allahabad Bank plans to enter into the insurance business through its 100 per cent subsidiary ? Allbank Finance. The subsidiary is also looking at floating a realty fund prompted by the booming domestic housing sector.

 The bank has already discussed the different aspects of life and non-life insurance businesses with the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA).

 Allbank Finance has a capital base of Rs 60 crore. If it wants to make a foray into insurance, its own capital is not enough to sustain the business. The capital base of an insurance business should be Rs 100 crore.

 Sources said some Singapore-based foreign institutional investors have already shown interest in becoming partners in the banks foray into this new line of business. The bank is also open to the idea of strategic tie-ups with other banks for floating the insurance arm.

 Allahabad Bank chairman and managing director . N. Singh said, ?We will have to do a detailed due diligence for the insurance business.? The bank has appointed Ernst amp; Young as a consultant and is taking the views of many insurance experts.

 The recent boom in the housing sector has also prompted the bank to float a realty fund through Allbank Finance. At present, there are three players in the realty fund ? ICICI Ventures, HDFC and Kotak.

 Singh said their second float has helped the bank to access high networth individuals (HNIs). ?We have a huge database of HNIs whom we can approach for our realty fund. We are currently discussing with our consultant on the proposed structure of the realty fund,? he added.

 Apart from entering the insurance business, Allbank Finance has applied to Sebi for a merchant banking licence. 

 The subsidiary plans to enter into investment banking (including structured finance amp; debt advisory), stock broking, wealth management and portfolio advisory and underwriting.

 Bank profit 

 The net profit of Allahabad Bank has gone up by 16.92 per cent to Rs 541.80 crore in 2004-05 from Rs 463.38 crore in the previous year.

 The operating profit of the bank has increased to Rs 1072.62 crore from Rs 876.25 crore ? a growth of 22.41 per cent.

 The banks total business grew by 31.44 per cent to Rs 62914 crore from Rs 47,865 crore in the previous year. Singh said the bank has set a target of 27 per cent growth in business (Rs 80,000 crore) in the current fiscal.

 The bank has drawn up an extensive plan to implement managerial and operational autonomy.

 ?The entire structure of remuneration, recruitment and promotion will undergo a change,? Singh added.

 Kanoria Chem in power pact

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 30: Kanoria Chemicals amp; Industries Ltd, one of the leading manufacturers of chemical intermediates in the country, has signed a power purchase agreement with Power Trading Corporation for selling its captive power.

 Kanoria Chemicals (KCI), which has its registered office here, will supply 10 MW surplus power from the coal-based thermal power plant at its integrated chlor-alkali manufacturing facility in Renukoot, Uttar Pradesh. 

 According to the agreement, the company will sell the surplus power to Power Trading (PTC), which in turn, will wheel or evacuate the power to its deficient, but revenue yielding locations.

 Apart from efficient utilisation of the surplus power, this deal would also add a new revenue stream for KCI, said R. V. Kanoria, chairman and managing director of KCI.

 The contract has the flexibility to allow KCI to continue to aggressively grow its own captive requirements in future, he added. The company is currently midway through its twin complementary Rs 180-crore expansion project in Renukoot.

 Following the expansion, Kanoria Chemicals? power generation capacity would double to 50 MW, from the existing 25 MW.

 It is also setting up a state-of-the-art chlor-alkali plant with a capacity of 110 tonne per day, which would help KCI add to its caustic-soda manufacturing facility and also strategically de-risk its business amidst rapid technological developments and ensure enhanced profitability.

 The additional caustic-soda production facility will consume about half of the power generated by the new power plant and the balance power would be sold to PTC.

 New Delhi, March 4: Korean giant Samsung India Electronics plans to invest $5 million in India to manufacture ?heat exchange component? for air-conditioners.

 ?At present, we import this component from Korea. We will invest $5 million for this purpose in our Greater Noida (near Delhi) plant before the end of this calendar year. This will help both in cost cutting and faster availability of ACs,? said Pradeep Tognata, senior vice president-sales, Samsung India Electronics (SIE).

 Addressing the issue of any possibility in upward price revision of products post-budget announcements, he said, ?Our commercial department is working on the details. If there is any such move, we will announce it in a week?s time.?

 The company, which today launched ?silver nano technology?, a silver anti-bacteria technology used in washing machines, air-conditioners and refrigerators to keep it germ free, has projected its total sales to cross Rs 6,500 crore in the current calendar year. This marks a jump of approximately 40 per cent from Rs 4,900 crore worth of sales done in 2004.

 ?This technology has been developed in a period of three years with an investment of $10 million invested in its research and development,? said Ravinder Zutshi, director-sales, Samsung.

 The company had, a couple of months back, introduced this same technology in few of its refrigerator models and on an expensive AC-split model.

 ?Yes, we did some test marketing few months back. The results were quite positive. We have now formally introduced the technology across our product line up,? Zutshi said.

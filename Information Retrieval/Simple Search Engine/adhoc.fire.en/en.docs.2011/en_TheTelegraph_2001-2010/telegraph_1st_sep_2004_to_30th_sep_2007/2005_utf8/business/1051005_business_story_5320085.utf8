 Online coal trade yet to pick up

 Calcutta, Oct. 4: Coal India Limited may miss the target of coal offtake through the e-auction route as set out by the government. 

 The ministry had set an offtake target of 10 million tonnes through the e-auction route. But the figures released by CIL for the April?August period this year show that the total quantity of coal allocated by it through the e-auction route is 5 million tonnes.

 Senior officials of CIL said, The e-auctioning of coal is receiving a lukewarm response. We had initially thought that CIL will be able to surpass the figure. But going by the trend it seems that we may even miss the target set out by the ministry.

 The bid-price for the allocated quantity is Rs 829.1 crore, which is at a 30.9 per cent premium over the floor price of Rs 633.2 crore.

 Coal India introduced the e-auctioning of the mineral for non-core consumers. The objective was to bring about more transparency in marketing of the fuel to non-regular consumers so that they can buy their choice of coal by paying the market determined price and that, too, from a particular source or siding. Under the new system, buyers get access to a bidding process, which is transparent. 

 The sale of coal is based on the market-determined price, thereby reducing the chances of black marketing. Registration for e-auction is permitted online for all. Any bidder located in any part of the country is free to bid for coal from any mine or siding from where it is being offered for sale without any reference to linkage.

 Even though CIL may miss the target on the e-auction front, it has surpassed the profit target for the April-August period. Its profit before tax for the period stood at Rs 2461.79 crore against a target of Rs 1966.05 crore. 

 The company had earned a profit of Rs 1851.70 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.

 During the first five months of the current fiscal, coal production stood at 125.36 million tonnes compared with a target of 127.86 million tonnes. Production during the same period last year was 118.13 million tonnes.

 Despatches during the period was 131.50 million tonnes against a target of 134.77 million tonnes, up from 127.88 million tonnes recorded in the same period last year.

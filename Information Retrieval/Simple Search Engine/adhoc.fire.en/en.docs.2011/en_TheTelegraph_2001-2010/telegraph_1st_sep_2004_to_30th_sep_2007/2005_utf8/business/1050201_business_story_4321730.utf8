The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Safe on the bottomline

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 31: The ordinance to recover Rs 450 crore from ITC in the 17-year-old excise evasion case will have no immediate impact on the company?s bottomline, feel observers who have watched the firm over the years.

 The Central Board of Excise and Customs had filed a case against ITC alleging that the company evaded excise duty to the extent of Rs 803 crore between 1983 and 1987 by selling cigarettes at a price higher than what was printed.

 The company has set aside the entire amount in its accounts, which would have been freed if the Supreme Court order quashing the excise demand took effect.

 ?This would have resulted in higher earnings per share (EPS) and, therefore, raised returns for shareholders. However, the ordinance will not affect cash flows. What it will impact is the movement of the ITC stock,? analysts feel. Some say the share could take a knock of Rs 18.

 The ordinance issued today redefines retail prices for excise-duty calculations. It will be based on the printed, or market price, whichever is higher. 

 For the first nine months of this financial year, ITC?s net sales stood at Rs 5,308 crore, profit before tax at Rs 2,000 crore and profit after tax at Rs 1,396 crore; its earnings per share was Rs 56.35.

 Cigarette sales in the third quarter rose to Rs 2,419 crore from Rs 2,302 crore in the same period of 2003-04, while profit before tax inched up to Rs 560 crore from Rs 510 crore. Despite laws curbing consumption of tobacco products, the education cess on excise and rising state levies, brand launches and new pack designs helped ITC sell more cigarettes. 

 In non-cigarette products, the company?s sales rose to Rs 152 crore in October-December from Rs 88 crore same time last year. Losses in this segment fell to Rs 37 crore from Rs 40 crore.

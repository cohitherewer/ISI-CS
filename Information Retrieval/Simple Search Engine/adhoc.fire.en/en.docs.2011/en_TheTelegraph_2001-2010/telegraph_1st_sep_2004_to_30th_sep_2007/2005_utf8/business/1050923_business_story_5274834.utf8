 Nuclear power put on fast track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi. Sept. 22: The Union cabinet today approved four sites for the construction of eight new nuclear reactors, but Nuclear Power Corporation (NPC) officials said it is unclear where four of the reactors will come from.

 The approval covers two 700 mw reactors in Kakrapar, Gujarat, two 700 mw reactors in Rawatbhata, Rajasthan, two 1000 mw reactors in Kudankulam, Tamil Nadu, and two 1000 mw reactors in Jaitapur in Maharashtras Konkan region.

 While Kakrapar, Rawatbhata and Kudankulam already host either operating or under-construction nuclear power plants, Konkan is a new site picked for a nuclear power installation.

 While the 700 mw reactors are homegrown pressurised heavy water reactors, the 1000 mw reactors are intended to be imported light water reactors. 

 A senior NPC official said acquisition of light water reactors from foreign countries will hinge on the Indo-US nuclear agreement signed earlier this year moving forward. The US has indicated that it would help India acquire nuclear power plants and fuel in exchange for India separating its military and civilian nuclear facilities.

 This is only site approval, we now have to prepare detailed project reports, said the official. Well be ready to do it for the 700 mw plants, but well have to wait for a deal on the light water reactors, the official said. 

 Coastal sites have been picked for the light water reactors because their construction will involve importing equipment on ships, the official said.

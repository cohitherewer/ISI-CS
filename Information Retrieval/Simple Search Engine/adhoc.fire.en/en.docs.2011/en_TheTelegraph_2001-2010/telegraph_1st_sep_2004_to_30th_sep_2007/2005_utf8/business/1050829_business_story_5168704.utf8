 Q amp;A

 Half ticket

 Many airlines offer check fares and low-cost air tickets. Since these are already bought at a concession, do they qualify for LTA rebate ? 

 T. M. Kumar, by e-mail

 Under LTA, one cannot claim more than the economy 

 class fare in case of air travel. Therefore, if the 

 tickets you buy are within the limit of economy fares, 

 such tickets should be eligible for leave travel concession.

 Returned with thanks

 I have a PAN and had been submitting income tax returns regularly during my service. After superannuation, my income became far less than the taxable limit of Rs 50,000 and, therefore, I stopped filing my IT returns. Is it correct? My age is 65. Please Advice. 

 Ajay Sharma, Hazinagar 

 If you are not covered under the one by six scheme, you are not required to file income tax returns based on your income. However, it is prudent to inform your assessing officer about the discontinuation of filing the returns.

 Rebate debate

 I am a govt employee. I regularly file my IT returns. My total yearly income is approximately Rs 3 lakh. I purchased a flat in 2003 and took bank loan for Rs 8 lakh. I am getting income tax rebate on the interest. Recently, I have sold my flat, but am regularly repaying the EMI as before. May I continue to get the rebate as before?

 W.J. K Singh, by e-mail

 Such exemptions are provided on the basis of the assets acquired by you. Since you have sold the flat against which you were claiming the benefits, you will no longer be able to do so.

 Building bonds

 How shall the interest earned from infrastructure bonds be treated from the current year?

 Sandeep Singh, Ludhiana

 After the removal of section 80L, interest on infrastructure bonds shall be added to the total income.

 Selloff heat leaves govt cold on Nalco

 New Delhi, Aug. 22: The mines ministry will accept a 10 per cent stake sale in Nalco through a market offering of shares, a proposition the finance ministry and Planning Commission feel is a political hot potato at this juncture. The slide in aluminium prices is also a hurdle.

 The mines ministry made its views known in response to a suggestion from North Block several months back for a 20 per cent divestment through stock exchanges. It is now ready for half of that, but the finance ministry is no longer keen on going ahead with the sale. 

 Officials in other key ministries consulted on divestment say the sale would not be expedient at this point of time. They also point to the weakening aluminium prices in the futures market to argue that stocks of firms using the metal as their key input would tumble.

 This is a bad time to sell. The price curve for aluminium on the London Metal Exchange is plunging. We will voice our concerns on that score, an official said. 

 For the government too, the decision is a tough one, politically. With the Lefts resistance to the sale of navratnas, taking a decision on stake sales ahead of the Bihar elections would be like waving a red rag before the bull. 

 Finance ministry officials say they are trying to bring profit-making state-run enterprises, not part of the navratna club, to the stock market. However, the cabinet will find it difficult, financially and politically, to sell Nalco shares on bourses at this stage, an officials said. 

 Shares of the state-run aluminium firm are traded in the range of Rs 165-170 now, down from its 52-week high of Rs 209. A 10 per cent stake sale at current prices should yield about Rs 900-1,000 crore, but the government would rather lose this money than spark a selloff shindig.

 The Centre, which owns 87.15 per cent of Nalco, had sought to sell 29.15 per cent and hand over management control to a strategic buyer in 2003. However, opposition from Naveen Patnaiks Biju Janata Dal, which was part of the BJP-led ruling coalition, nixed the plan.

 Proposals to sell a 30 per cent stake ? 10 per cent in the local market and 20 per cent through American depository receipts (ADR) ? later also ran into a wall of resistance.

 Nalco is now in the throes of a Rs 4,091-crore project to raise its aluminium smelter capacity at Angul from 3.45 lakh tonnes to 4.6 lakh tonnes, and expand the companys power plant from 960 megawatt (mw) to 1200 mw. 

 Ramping up the smelter will go hand in hand with the expansion of Nalcos bauxite mining facilities at Pattangi in Koraput district and Kodingamal in Raygarda. These will raise its mining capacity by 15 lakh tonnes.

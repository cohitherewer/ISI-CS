 Left wants trade text rewritten

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Nath: Balancing act

 New Delhi, Oct. 17: The Left parties today asked the government not to make commitments in WTO talks without a national consensus, especially on farm issues that appear to be heavily loaded in favour of developed countries.

 The 14-page response from the parties follows the government-framed note on WTO negotiations in the run-up to the December ministerial meeting in Hong Kong. 

 The leaders have sought a white paper on the strategy that India would adopt at the WTO ministerial talks. The Left insisted that South-South co-operation should underpin the approach to the discussions. 

 The Left parties explained how the agreement on agriculture favoured capital-intensive methods and corporate groups and how it hurt the livelihoods of poor farmers. 

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath has promised there would be no compromise on the interests of farmers, but he has been trying hard to remove the Lefts perception that the government had agreed to non-linear Swiss-type formula under the Argentina-Brazil-India proposal. These parties said there was a need to reconsider this arrangement since it obliged India to grant tariff concessions without corresponding give-aways from the developed countries.

 The parties have urged the government not to dilute the position on agriculture or non-agriculture market access to make gains on services like BPO and movement of professionals. The leaders said there was a need to revise the offer on services since it was aimed at meeting the demands of developed countries, rather than local needs.

 On industrial tariffs, there was concern over India agreeing to rewrite the Derbez text, rejected by most developing countries, including India, at the Cancun talks.

 Meeting put off

 Nath today ran into trouble when some Left leaders were turned back from his Parliament chamber for not carrying entry passes. He will now meet them on Thursday.

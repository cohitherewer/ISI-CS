 GE divests insurance unit

 Immelt: Looking ahead

 New York, Nov. 18 (Reuters): General Electric Co on Friday forecast sharper earnings growth for 2006, boosted its dividend and stock buyback plan and agreed to sell most of its reinsurance business to Swiss Re for $6.8 billion.

 After the deal closes, GE said it would own between 10 per cent and 13 per cent of Swiss Res common stock and have the right to nominate one representative for election to the reinsurers board.

 The improved outlook and plans to return more cash to shareholders come as GE shares remain mired in a slump. The companys stock has fallen 5 per cent in the year to date versus a 2 per cent decline on the S amp;P 500.

 Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer with Solaris Asset Management, which owns GE shares, praised the moves. Raising the dividend is a long-term vote of confidence by the board in the direction of the company and the growth of the company. The repurchase plan really is very much in the same light.

 GE, whose shares rose 2 per cent in pre-market trade, said it expects earnings, excluding the insurance business, of $1.92 to $2.02 a share for 2006, up 12 per cent to 17 per cent from its current forecast for 2005.

 The company had previously forecast 10-15 per cent growth. It now targets 2005 earnings from continuing operations of about $1.72 a share. Before the sale, it had been on track to meet its forecast of $1.81 to $1.83, it said.

 The company will report most of its insurance earnings, which it had expected to contribute about 10 cents per share to earnings in 2005 and 2006, as discontinued operations.

 GE will receive up to $3.7 billion in cash and notes for the insurance business, about 55 per cent of the $6.8 billion purchase price. The remaining 45 per cent of the deal value will be paid in Swiss Re shares, GE said.

 Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE has been scaling back its insurance business to reduce some earnings volatility and allocate capital for faster-growing businesses, such as consumer finance and medical equipment.

 Since 2002, GE has shrunk its reinsurance business and spun off its life and mortgage insurance firm Genworth Financial Inc. Analysts and investors had expected the sale of the reinsurance business for some time.

 CEO Jeff Immelt said after the sale, the company would have a better mix of growth, higher return on equity financial services businesses and faster-growing industrial businesses, all driving stronger free cash flow.

 Global trade issues to be resolved fast

 Dalian, China, July 13 (Reuters): Ministers from around the world accepted blame on Wednesday for the snails pace of global trade talks and pledged to raise their game in time for a make-or-break meeting in Hong Kong in December.

 The ministers, from more than 30 rich and poor countries, took comfort from progress toward a compromise formula on how to cut farm tariffs, a major obstacle to a trade deal that the World Bank says would lift tens of millions out of poverty.

 We will work to increase momentum towards our goal of a successful conclusion of the Doha negotiations by the end of 2006, our highest common priority in trade policy for the year ahead, a statement issued by the chairmen of the meeting said.

 But wrapping up two days of talks in this northern Chinese coastal city, they admitted to grave concern that the talks were moving more slowly than anticipated and they abandoned the goal of reaching the first sketch of an agreement by the end of July.

 Supachai Panitchpakdi, director-general of the World Trade Organisation, said the talks ? named after Qatars capital, where they were launched in 2001 ? were at a critical juncture.

 My overall assessment of where we stand at the moment is still one of great concern, Supachai told a news conference.

 This did not mean the Hong Kong meeting, which will aim to agree on the parameters of a deal, was doomed to fail. But all 148 WTO members needed to work harder. This is the time for decisions to be made at the political level, said Supachai.

 European Union trade commissioner Peter Mandelson said, Can we make it to Hong Kong? The answer is yes, but not at this rate of progress.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Sea breeze from all sides, laden with lucky charm

 My First Home

 Celina Jaitley - Actor 

 Its been just three months since I moved into my first real home ? a penthouse that I have bought with my hard-earned money. Its like a dream come true for me. Before this, I was staying in a rented apartment in Lokhandwala.

 The penthouse is in Versova and faces the sea ? every room looks out to the water. The place has four bedrooms and a study apart from a huge terrace facing the sea. I am planning to instal a jacuzzi and a steam bath on the terrace so that I dont have to go out to keep myself fit.

 As for the design of the new place, well, I havent taken the help of any interior designer as I wanted to do up the place by myself. We have got down some Victorian furniture from our ancestral home up in the mountains. Its all dark teakwood and theres a lot of glass and crystal everywhere. So the blend of the old wood and the glass makes for a very nice look. As for the upholstery, I have gone for off-white to contrast with the dark shades of the furniture.

 There is a lot of natural light coming in all the time and the sea breeze blowing in is the best thing about this penthouse. While I cant just go out walking on the beach ? I will be mobbed and molested (laughs) ? I do enjoy looking at the sea from my home. The sea changes colour more than 10 times a day and its such a beautiful sight.

 The penthouse has been such an old dream of mine but property here in Mumbai is so costly ? its more expensive than Singapore. But God has been really kind and I am just loving this new place.

 I am a big believer in God, especially Ma Kali and Ma Durga. So I have this small little puja ghar in my kitchen. Thats where panditji asked me to put it up. If Gods with you, all the Vaastu Shastra and the Feng Shuis will be taken care of.

 I feel this new home of mine has been really lucky. I have got two new films, my brother has become a para-commando and I am meeting such great people ever since I have moved base here. Theres so much of positive energy at my new penthouse!

 Cutbacks weigh on Hewlett earnings

 DAMON DARLIN

 San Francisco, Nov. 18: Hewlett-Packard reported Thursday that its quarterly net income declined sharply because of expenses related to cost-cutting, but it said the cutbacks resulted in a strong increase in operating income.

 Hewlett said profit for its fourth quarter ended October 31 fell 62 per cent to $416 million, or 14 cents a share, from $1.09 billion, or 37 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. The company said the decline was caused by about $1.1 billion in costs related to the revamping effort. Since July, Hewlett has announced plans to eliminate 15,300 jobs and cut costs about $2 billion a year.

 About 4,700 employees have already left the company.

 The cost cuts have had an immediate effect. The company noted that operating income was 51 cents a share in the quarter, up 24 per cent from a year earlier. It was a far greater increase than even the most optimistic Wall Street analysts had expected. The consensus estimate was 46 cents a share. 

 Our efforts are paying off, said Mark V. Hurd, president and chief executive.

 Revenue rose 7 per cent, to $22.9 billion from $21.4 billion, across all lines of Hewletts business. The earnings report reflected the beginning of a turnaround effort by Hurd, who joined the company in March after 25 years with NCR. Hewlett generated free cash flow of $6.6 billion for the year, the highest level in its history.

 Hewlett stock closed Thursday at $29, up 73 cents, before the earnings announcement was made. It rose another 6 per cent in after-hours trading, climbing as high as $30.79. 

 The stock price is up more than 45 percent since Hurd was named chief executive.

 Moreover, the companys revenue growth is drawing closer to that of its archrival, Dell, whose growth rates have far outpaced those of others in the industry. Dell reported last week that its revenue growth had slowed to 11 percent year-over-year and could slow to 8.5 percent in the current quarter.

 Hurd told analysts after the earnings release that the company was executing its plans well. quot;We grew revenue, quot; he said. quot;We were more disciplined in pricing. We were tighter with the buck. quot;

 Hurd said he had not expected revenue growth to climb substantially, so he had focused on improving profit margins by cutting costs.

 quot;It remains a cost-concentric story, quot; said A.M. Sacconaghi, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. As more jobs are cut and the company finds more efficient ways to do business, earnings should continue to improve, he said.

 Hewlett projected that net income for the current quarter, ending Jan. 31, would be up as much as 33 percent, despite a decline in revenue growth to about 4.6 percent, largely because of overseas currency conversions. quot;You are seeing the benefits of big, big cost cuts, quot; Sacconaghi said.

 Hewlett also said it had awarded significant bonuses to employees, the first time it has done so in four years. It refused to disclose the amount.

 Analysts were struck by the results in the companys enterprise storage and servers group, which sells multimillion-dollar orders of computers and storage devices to large companies. Overall revenue in that group was up 10 percent to $4.5 billion, with an operating profit of $405 million, an increase of 9.1 percent from the year-earlier period.

 Richard S. Chu, an analyst with SG Cowen Securities, said the performance in that area was encouraging because it had been the most inconsistent and volatile line of business for the company.

 Hewletts printer group posted lower operating profit, down 18.5 percent, to $896 million from $1.1 million a year ago. Revenue, however, increased 4 percent, to $6.8 million.

 Hurd said the company was shipping ink-intensive printers, like colour laser printers and multifunction printers, at a faster pace, but consumer printer shipments declined 4 percent in the quarter.

 Printers provide almost half of the companys revenue, so growth in this area is crucial. The growth rate for printer shipments has been slowing throughout the year.

 In the PC segment, operating profit climbed 159 percent, to $200 million from $77 million a year ago, although revenue grew 9 percent. Notebook computer revenue growth of 23 percent offset flat revenue for desktop PCs. The company also performed strongly in the commercial area.

 Hewletts net income for the year was $4.7 billion, or $1.62 a share, up from $4.07 billion, or $1.33, in fiscal 2004. Revenue for the year rose 8.5 percent, to $86.7 billion from $79.9 billion a year ago.

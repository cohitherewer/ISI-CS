 Stamped out: Duty for bourse rejig

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 28: The finance minister today granted a one-time exemption from stamp duty on the transfer of assets to allow leading stock exchanges to convert themselves into corporate entities.

 The Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, amended recently, requires all stock exchanges to be corporatised and de-mutualised. Three stock exchanges are not yet corporatised. 

 ?To facilitate their corporatisation, I propose to grant a one-time exemption to them from stamp duty on the notional transfer of assets,? finance minister P. Chidambaram said in his speech.

 The move will enable the premier stock exchange to convert itself into a corporate entity. The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) is in the process of transforming itself from an association of members to a corporate in line with the other leading bourses in the country. The finance minister?s sop is expected to allow the bourse to complete all formalities by 2005-06.

 Chidambaram also made provisions for a level-playing field for banks and non-bank entities.

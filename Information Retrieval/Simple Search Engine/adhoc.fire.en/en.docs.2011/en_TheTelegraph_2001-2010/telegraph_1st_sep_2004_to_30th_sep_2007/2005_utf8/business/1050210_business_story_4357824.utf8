 Foreign funds buy when mutuals sell 

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Calcutta, Feb. 9: Foreign institutional investors and domestic mutual funds took contrarian equity investment strategies last year.

 FIIs pumped in a record Rs 38,965 crore in the equity market, while mutual funds pulled out Rs 917 crore last year.

 The buying decision of the two entities converged only in January and March, when both emerged as net buyers. 

 In January, when the 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange sensitive index crossed the 6,000 points, both FIIs and funds bought stocks worth Rs 3,177 and Rs 942 crore, respectively.

 Again in March, when the sensex was down 1.36 per cent, the duo turned out to be net buyers.

 However, barring these two months, the entities followed opposite investment strategies and in May, when the equity markets catapulted on account of unexpected parliamentary poll results, they chose to differ.

 While FIIs pulled out over Rs 3,247 crore during the month, mutual funds pumped in Rs 1,005 crore. This was also the highest monthly investment made by domestic mutual funds in 2004.

 In the past too, FIIs and mutual funds have taken opposite calls on the equity market and this is apparent from the figures available for the three calendar years from 2002 to 2004.

 Of the 36 months from January 2002 to December 2004, FIIs and mutual funds adopted opposite investment strategies in 23 months.

 However, Sethuram Iyer, chief investment officer of SBI Mutual Fund, says: ?There is no specific reason for this contrary strategy. Foreign investors bring money in India whenever they wish to invest and the last year reflected their bullishness on the country.?

 ?The domestic funds, on the contrary, faced redemption pressure during the year and that is the reason they emerged as net sellers during the major part of the year,? explained Iyer.

 The domestic funds mirrored the investment decision of its foreign counterparts during the last two weeks of 2004. Between December 14 and December 30, the mutual funds also became net buyers and have pumped in over Rs 450 crore.

 In January this year, mutual funds invested Rs 547.71 crore surpassing the FIIs buying of Rs 457.10 crore. The trend is again on a reversal in February with FIIs purchasing stocks worth Rs 3,944 crore till February 7 and funds selling Rs 153 crore.

 Calcutta, Oct. 22: The interest rate movements in the country would determine the behaviour of stock markets.

 Interest rates would play an important role in directing the movement of stocks, said R.K. Nair, executive director of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). He was addressing an investors conference organised by the Association of NSE members of India (Anmi). The conference was sponsored by Guiness Securities.

 In India, stock market turnover was greater than that from the debt markets, while the trend is reverse worldwide, he said.

 According to stock market analyst P.N. Vijay, while interest rate would be an important factor, gross domestic product growth and exchange rate would determine the behaviour of bourses in India.

 Vijay said it was expected that the current bull-run would continue for another 18 months due to the forecast of a good economic growth. India should register a GDP growth of around 7-7.5 per cent backed by agriculture growth of 3.5-4 per cent due to sufficient, though late, monsoons and industry growth of 9 per cent, he said. The next fiscal would also maintain the growth momentum with high consumption, spending and demand, he added.

 World over, interest rates are amongst the most important factors that determine the stock market movement. The analysts on Wall Street always keep an eye on Feds decisions on interest rate movements to gauge the direction of the equity market, he said.

 Interest rate is of high relevance because as cost of money goes up with rising interest rates, it proves bearish for the stock market, he explained.

 High interest rates make it more attractive to invest in the debt market with the safety of assured risk free returns. 

 Also, it makes borrowing more expensive and, therefore, less borrowed funds is channelled into the stock markets, he added.

 BPO unit to be set up in Romania 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Bangalore, Oct. 19: Wipro will open its first overseas BPO facility in Romania later this year. 

 The company, however, declined to reveal the quantum of investment or headcount at the centre in eastern Europe. 

 The BPO facility will be located in Romania to expand our language capabilities for voice, transaction processing and level one and level two (L-1 amp; L-2) support services for infrastructure management, chief financial officer Suresh Senapaty said today.

 With Europe accounting for 33 per cent of its global IT business revenue during July-September, the company has decided to locate its service offerings in the lower end of the value chain closer to the growing number of customers there. 

 Chairman Azim Premji said while onsite and offshore locations operate in line with the requirements of customers, near-shore centres help accelerate growth and enhance comfort level of clients. 

 We believe its a win-win situation for our customers as well as the company to be located as close as possible to our BPO customers, he added.

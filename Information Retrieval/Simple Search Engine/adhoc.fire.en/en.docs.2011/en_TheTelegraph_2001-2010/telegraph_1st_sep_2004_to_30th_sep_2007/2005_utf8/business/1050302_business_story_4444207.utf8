 Fillip for small finance firms

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Calcutta, March 1: The importance attributed to the micro-finance institutions by finance minister P. Chidambaran in the budget could turn out to be one of the best moves to alleviate poverty and increase employment in rural India.

 Apart from institutions and self-help groups, Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) would see a spurt in activities following an increase in kitty and streamline finance mechanism at the grassroots level .

 ?The rural poor will benefit the most. They could expect easier and cheaper source of funds to set up small enterprises and also supplement income,? said Chandrasekhar Ghosh, chief executive officer of Bandhan, a city-based institution.

 As the details of the proposed Micro Finance Development and Equity Fund is awaited, the financial institutions, self-help groups and institutions are enthusiastic about easier flotation and funding opportunities of these organisations engaged in rural employment.

 The provision to increase funds for development of micro-finance institutions and self-help groups from Rs 100 crore in the current fiscal to Rs 200 crore in 2005-06 and the plans to enlarge their number from 1 lakh to 2.5 lakh next year would give them a fillip to set up small businesses, a Sidbi official said.

 Sidbi offers funds to over 10 major institutions in Bengal and there was hardly any default, a top official noted.

 According to sources, each of the 2 lakh self-help groups that function in the rural areas offers funds and monitor the progress. The target to increase the number of self-help groups would definitely mean a much higher coverage of these institutions and also beneficiaries in rural India.

 Funds for the micro-finance institutions, which remained a major constraint, could be overcome following a move to get the institutions and self-help groups tie up with banks for cheaper and easier sourcing. The indication to let the organisations tap the external commercial borrowing route could help raising funds at cheaper rates.

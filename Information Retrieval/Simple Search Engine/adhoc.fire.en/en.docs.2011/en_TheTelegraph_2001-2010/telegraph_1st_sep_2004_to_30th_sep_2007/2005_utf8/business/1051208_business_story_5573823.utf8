 S Kumars to expand

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 7: S. Kumars Nationwide has earmarked Rs 400 crore to be invested over the next four years in consolidating its textile business.

 The company is planning to enter the home textile segment and increase its presence in the ready-to-wear market. Apart from this, it will also expand the manufacturing capacity of its Reid amp; Taylor branded garments.

 According to the company officials, these measures have been mooted to capitalise on the opportunities thrown up by the buoyant textile market in the post-quota regime and circumvent competition in the wake of sizeable investments currently being made in the industry.

 In a communication to stock exchanges today, S Kumars said the expansion-cum-diversification plan would focus on expanding the Reid amp; Taylor capacity at an investment of Rs 90 crore and enhancing its share in the ready-to-wear garments with an investment of Rs 50 crore. This apart, the company has decided to venture into home textiles, for which Rs 80 crore has been budgeted, and another Rs 130 crore has been kept aside for manufacturing high value cotton shirts.

 These investments will be partly funded through internal accruals and partly by tapping the market with equity-related instruments or foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs), American depository receipts or Global depository receipts.

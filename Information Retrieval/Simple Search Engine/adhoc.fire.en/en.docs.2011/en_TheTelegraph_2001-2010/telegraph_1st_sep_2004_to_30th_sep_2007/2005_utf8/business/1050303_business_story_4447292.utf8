 Calcutta, March 2: The National Investors? Forum (NIF) has demanded an exit option for shareholders in case of company mergers.

 Chandravadan Desai, managing trustee and settler of NIF, said dissenting investors, who were unhappy with the merger ratio, should be given a choice of selling their stake by the reverse book-building process.

 ?There is the Reserve Bank guideline for valuation in case of a merger. There is also the Securities and Exchanges Board of India (Sebi) delisting norms by the reverse book-building process,? Desai said.

 In case of the recent merger of Kochi Refineries Ltd (KRL) with Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), the merger ratio adversely impacted the stock prices of KRL.

 The NIF has written to ministries of finance, petroleum and natural gas and the standing committee on public sector undertakings regarding the BPCL-KRL merger. The KRL stock prices tumbled from Rs 240 to Rs 170 after the swap ratio was announced. Desai said KRL should have been valued at a much higher price. ?We will take up the entire merger issue with Sebi and also the Company Law Board (CLB),? he added.

 The reverse book-building process would realise the true value of a stock, Sudip Bandyopadhyay, an NIF trustee, said.

 The foundation also supported the hostile takeover moves as long as these benefit the shareholders.

 ?We are concerned about an investor getting good prices. If the stocks move up in case of a hostile takeover, we have nothing to say,? Bandyopadhyay clarified.

 Meanwhile, the NIF is also looking for greater participation of general public in the divestment programme.

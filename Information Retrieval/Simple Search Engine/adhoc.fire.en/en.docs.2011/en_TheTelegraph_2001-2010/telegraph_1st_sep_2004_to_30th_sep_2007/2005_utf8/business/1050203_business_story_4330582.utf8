 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: The Union cabinet today gave its approval for the proposed Saarc Limited Multilateral Agreement to avoid double taxation and promote mutual administrative assistance in tax matters.

 The agreement seeks to promote mutual administrative assistance and co-operation in tax matters among member states of the South Asian Association for Regional Co-operation (Saarc). It will also provide tax relief to students and teachers for pursuing their academic interest.

 The responsibility of preparing a draft on the issue was entrusted to India, said Union finance minister P. Chidambaram.

 Chidambaram said the cabinet approved the creation of a post of chairman of the National Council of Rural Institute as proposed by the human resource development ministry. 

 In an attempt to eliminate obsolete regulations, the cabinet also approved a proposal to amend the Standards of Weights and Measures Act 1976.

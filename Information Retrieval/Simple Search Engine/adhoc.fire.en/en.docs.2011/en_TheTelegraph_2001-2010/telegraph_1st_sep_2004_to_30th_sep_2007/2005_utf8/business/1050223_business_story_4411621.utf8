 Calcutta, Feb. 22: A fresh revival package for ailing tyre company Dunlop India Ltd will be ready in four months. 

 The package will suggest measures for revival as well as long-term survival of the company.

 The company decided on a fresh revival package at a two-hour tripartite meeting today. ?We want to revive and reopen Dunlop. We have asked the management to come up with a feasible revival plan,? Union labour minister C. S. Chandrasekhar Rao said.

 Dunlop?s Sahagunj and Ambattur factories are closed since February 7 and 8 of 1998, respectively.

 State labour minister Mohammad Amin, chief secretary Ashok Gupta, a team of managers from Dunlop and representatives of Citu and Intuc unions of Sahagunj and a union representative from the head office were part of the meeting.

 Rao said the Jumbo group, the holding company of Dunlop, has already appointed the National Productivity Council (NPC) for working out a revival package. The report will be tabled within the next three months.

 ?Dunlop had appointed NPC after the government called a meeting in January last year,? the minister added.

 The government has also decided to set up a four-member committee that will interact with the management and NPC for working out the package. The committee will have three representatives from Bengal and one from the Centre.

 ?A decision on how to revive the company will be taken within 15 days of tabling the NPC report,? Rao said.

 The Union minister, however, made it clear that the Centre is serious about reviving Dunlop. ?The committee will look into the concessions that the company wants. We will do the needful,? he said.

 The company today submitted a fresh wish list to the government. It wants waiver of provident fund and ESI penalty, central excise duty waiver, electricity duty waiver among others.

 Rao added that the company will pay Rs 10.75 crore to its employees at Sahagunj and its head office to clear their PF dues and wages. 

 On January 30, the minister had announced that the company will pay 10 per cent of arrear wages of Rs 29 crore to the employees at Sahagunj and head office.

 The company had sold its head office ? Dunlop House ? to the Pataka Group for Rs 10.75 crore. The money is in the no lien account of State Bank of India. The company will have to go to Calcutta High Court for release of the funds.

 Citu representative Ashok Pal said, ?The management has appealed to the court to withdraw the entire money. However, we will plead to the court to release funds to clear 10 per cent of our arrear wages.?

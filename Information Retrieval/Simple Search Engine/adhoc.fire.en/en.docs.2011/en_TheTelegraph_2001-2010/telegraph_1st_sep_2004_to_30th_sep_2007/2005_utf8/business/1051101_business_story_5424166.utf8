 Japan, India to rework tax treaty

 Tokyo, Oct. 31 (Reuters): Japan and India have reached a broad agreement on revising a tax treaty as part of efforts to encourage more investment between the two countries, Japanese finance minister Sadakazu Tanigaki said today. 

 They agreed to cut the withholding tax on fees on technical services ? such as the value of cross-border technology transfers between companies, technical assistance and software development ? and the tax on royalties to 10 per cent from 20 per cent now.

 Given the importance of economic relations between Japan and India, this aims at promoting investment between the two countries, Tanigaki said. Software-related industries in both the countries have been asking for the tax to be abolished.

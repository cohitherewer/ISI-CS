 VAT-spectre haunts tea traders

 RAJA GHOSHAL 

 Bitter brew

 New Delhi, Feb. 11: Packaged tea traders are running scared of the value-added tax regime that kicks in on April 1.

 They are spooked by the buzz that major tea-consuming states like Orissa and Maharashtra will slap a 12.5 per cent VAT rate on tea, which could spark a Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kg rise in retail prices. Such a prospect would severely hit tea consumption and, therefore, their businesses.

 The states have been given the option of slapping a 4 per cent or a 12.5 per cent VAT rate on tea: and therein lies the rub. 

 States like Bengal, which is one of the strongest votaries of the VAT regime, have already announced that they will impose a 4 per cent VAT. 

 Other states are seen as being less sensitive to the concerns of the tea trade. Already, the sales tax (which will be replaced by VAT) in these states is as high as 8 per cent ? and they seem less keen to reduce their revenues from the trade.

 Regional brands like Waq Bakri in Gujarat, Girnar in Maharashtra, Lamsa in Andhra Pradesh, Today in Delhi, Marble in Maharashtra are on tenterhooks over the VAT schedule for tea in their states, which is expected soon. 

 Speaking to The Telegraph, Inder Singhee, president of Tea Packeters Association of India (TPAI), said, ?There is a vast gap between keeping it at 4 per cent and 12.5 per cent. Keeping it at such a high rate may mean the collapse of the tea industry in those states.?

 Singhee, who is the general manager of Godfrey Philips, said the states would gain more by way of revenue to the extent of Rs 2 per kg because VAT would be charged on the maximum retail price. The present tax is levied on the loose tea that the tea packeteer sources from the market.

 With Bengal announcing that it will levy VAT at 4 per cent on tea, tea packeteers feel that non-uniformity in the rate will lead to smuggling and other illegal activities. No other state has announced its intended VAT rate. Nor has any state come up with the schedule.

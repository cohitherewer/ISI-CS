 New Delhi, April 7: Consumer electronics major Samsung India plans to invest $12.5 million (over Rs 58 crore) this year to strengthen its research and development operations in India.

 The fresh infusion will raise its total R amp;D investment to over $24 million.

 At present, Samsung India?s R amp;D centre develops software for all of Samsung?s global requirements for colour TVs ? both analog and digital.

 The company is planning to shift the production lines of DVD and audio segments to India. ?At present, it is entirely imported from Korea, but we are studying the possibility of shifting the base to India,? said Neeraj Sethi, general manager-national sales (audio visual), Samsung India Electronics.

 Samsung today launched three digital video camcorders with its flagship model being the Samsung miniket.

 However, there are no plans to shift the production of projection televisions to India. ?This segment has not done significantly well. The market size is only 30,000 units,? he added.

 At present, Samsung enjoys a 21 per cent market share in this segment.

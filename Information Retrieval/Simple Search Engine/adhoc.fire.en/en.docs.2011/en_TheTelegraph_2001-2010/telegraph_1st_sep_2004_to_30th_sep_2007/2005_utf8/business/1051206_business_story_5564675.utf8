 Bank peaks to get crowded

 GAURAV CHOUDHURY

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: Recognising the expanding horizon of banking services, the government is planning to restructure the boards of nationalised banks and appoint three executive directors in each of them. At present, a public sector bank cannot have more than two whole-time directors ? a CMD and an executive director.

 According to sources, the experience of having one chairman-cum-managing director and one executive director on the boards of nationalised banks has been largely unsatisfactory and now there is a need for specific intensive attention to various activities such as credit, development, and personnel.

 The government will have to amend Section 9 (3) of the Banking Companies Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings Act, 1970/1980 to accommodate more whole-time directors on the boards of nationalised banks. 

 The government has also proposed a change in the number of shareholder-directors to provide for a more equitable representation on the bank boards. According to the existing norms, all the six non-official directors nominated by the government are replaced by shareholder-directors if the Centres shareholding falls below 60 per cent.

 This representation of directors does not correctly reflect the ownership pattern, sources said. The proposed norms will allow a maximum of three shareholder-directors on the board ? one for public shareholding up to 16 per cent, two for those up to 32 per cent and three for those above 32 per cent.

 After the amendment is made, the government can appoint six directors if its shareholding in the bank is 100 per cent, five if its stake is between 84 and 99 per cent, four if it holds between 67 and 83 per cent and three if it owns between 51 and 66 per cent.

 At present, the Centre holds the entire stake (100 per cent) in four nationalised banks and has majority equity (more than 51 per cent) in the remaining 15.

 The government has also proposed that the existing provision of nominating two directors by Sebi and financial institutions (FIs) be removed. Sources said the government feels that this norm should be deleted from the amended act on grounds of relevance as also considerations of conflict of interest between financial institutions and banks as they are beginning to compete for similar business in the same domain area. 

 So far Sebi has not nominated any person on the boards of nationalised banks.

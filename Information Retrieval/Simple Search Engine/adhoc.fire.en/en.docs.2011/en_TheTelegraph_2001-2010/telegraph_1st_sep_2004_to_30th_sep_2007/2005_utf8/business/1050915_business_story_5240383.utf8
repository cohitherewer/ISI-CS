 Sweatshop slur stalks Wal-Mart in wage-bias suit

 Shopping for Trouble

 Los Angeles, Sept. 14 (Reuters): Workers in six countries have filed a class-action lawsuit against Wal-Mart Stores Inc, claiming the worlds largest retailer overlooks sweatshop conditions at toy and clothing factories from China to Nicaragua.

 The suit, filed in California state court in Los Angeles, lists as plaintiffs 15 workers in Bangladesh, Swaziland, Indonesia, China and Nicaragua. They claim they were paid below minimum wage, forced to work unpaid overtime and in some cases even endured beatings by supervisors.

 The lawsuit also lists four California plaintiffs, including two unionised workers at Kroger Co unit Ralphs and Safeway Inc grocery stores, who claim Wal-Marts entry into southern California forced their employers to reduce pay and benefits.

 The suit could cover anywhere from 100,000 to 500,000 workers, according to attorney Terry Collingsworth of the International Labor Rights Fund, which represents the plaintiffs. Wal-Marts potential liability could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars, he said.

 Beth Keck, a spokeswoman for Wal-Marts international operations, said the retailer had not been formally served with the lawsuit, but had received a copy from journalists who obtained it from the lawyers involved.

 Its really too early for us to be able to say anything about this particular complaint, Keck said.It involves a number of companies and manufacturers and were just beginning our research to learn more. Were just at that beginning research phase.

 Wal-Mart became the worlds largest retailer by buying cheap, foreign-made goods and selling them to consumers at rock-bottom prices every day. Critics, however, say that low-price obsession has pressured store managers to overwork non-union employees and the retailer has been hit with dozens of lawsuits claiming violations of wage-and-hour laws.

 The company has also been the target of discrimination lawsuits. Last year, a judge said a lawsuit that charges the company discriminated against women in pay, promotions and training could proceed as a class action. That suit, the largest workplace bias lawsuit in US history, covers as many as 1.6 million current and former female US employees. The mounting litigation has taken a toll on Wal-Marts reputation.

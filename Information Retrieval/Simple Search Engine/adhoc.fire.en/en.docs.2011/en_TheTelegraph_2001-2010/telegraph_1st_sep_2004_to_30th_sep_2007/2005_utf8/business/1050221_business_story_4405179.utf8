 Q amp;A

 Payout missout

 I held units of Tata Balanced Fund, which I had redeemed on December 29, 2004. Again, on January 11, 2005, I bought units of the fund. In the meantime, the fund declared dividend on the fund with the record date being January 12, 2005. Shall I be entitled to the dividend?

 Bina Kantha Majumdar, Hooghly

 Yes, you shall be entitled to the dividend since all the unit holders whose names appear on the books of the fund on the record date are eligible to receive the dividend.

 Gain game

 I made some long-term capital gains by selling units of mutual fund in April 2004. Subsequently, I suffered some long-term capital loss while selling units of mutual fund and some shares in November 2004. Can this long-term capital loss be set off against long-term capital gains made earlier for calculating income tax dues for the year 2004-05?

 Saktinath Mukherjee, by email

 Yes, you can set off the long-term capital loss against the long-term capital gains for this financial year since such a gain was made prior to the announcement of abolishment of long-term capital gains on securities.

 Tax on NSC 

 Is tax deducted at source from the maturity proceeds of National Savings Certificate (NSC)?

 Rahul Saxena, Calcutta

 No, tax is not deducted at source from the maturity proceeds of NSC.

 Deduction on donations

 How much deduction can be claimed on donations made under section 80G?

 B. Dasgupta, Calcutta

 Deductions for donations under section 80G are mostly available for 50 per cent of the total sum donated. However, for special cases such as the Prime Minister?s Relief Fund and other specified funds, 100 per cent of the amount can be claimed as deduction.

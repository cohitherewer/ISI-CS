 New Delhi/Chandigarh, July 30: All the sacked and suspended workers of Honda Motorcycle will return to work.

 Under a deal late last night, the Japanese firm agreed to reinstate the sacked and suspended employees, but extracted the promise from union leaders that they will not raise fresh demands in the next one year.

 ?It?s a partial victory for us,? said Gurudas Dasgupta, who heads the powerful Left trade union AITUC with which the Honda union is affiliated. ?Our people still remain prisoners in Haryana jails ... many are still missing.?

 ?There was a dispute. We were facing a bit of difficulties then. But now there is no dispute. We have agreed to work together,? Yukihiro Aoshima, chief executive of Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Ltd, said after signing the deal.

 The Honda agitation had started two months ago over wages and attempts at not allowing workers to form a union. It turned into a full-fledged strike in June after the Japanese two-wheeler maker sacked four union leaders and suspended 50 others.

 Earlier this week, the agitation snowballed when police brutally attacked a workers? rally outside the district administration?s offices in Gurgaon and injured more than 100 workers.

 Haryana chief minister B.S. Hooda, who brokered the truce, said: ?The problem has been amicably solved. The management will take back the employees sacked or suspended.?

 Under the pact, workers will be allowed to remain members of the union they have formed and fresh talks will begin on wage hike. But the workers will lose pay for the days they were on strike.

 Honda officials said they would increase workers wages subject to their ?whole hearted cooperation, proper conduct, and meeting production targets?.

 A Honda spokesman, however, added that the injured workers would be given paid leave and those whose pay has been cut would be allowed to draw a salary advance. The deal said this was a final conciliation and in future both sides would maintain cordial relations.

 The agreement was signed by three representatives of the management ? Aoshima, director, general affairs, Masayoki Kato, and manager, human resources, Vivek Vishwanath. Those who signed on behalf of the workers included union leaders Suresh Gaur, Sujender Singh and Harjeet Singh. It was signed in the presence of Hooda and state financial commissioner and principal secretary, labour and employment, Promila Issar.

 ?We have resolved many outstanding issues. It is time for all of us to get back to work,? union leader Gaur said, denying there any pressure from the state government. ?The agreement is not one-sided,? he added.

 According to the agreement, all four dismissed workers would be re-employed after they tender an unconditional written apology.

 Asked about the criminal cases drawn up against the striking workers, Hooda said the ?law will take its own course?.

 This could set the stage for yet another round of confrontation between the Congress, which rules the state, and the Left, which is its ally at the Centre. ?These (legal cases against striking workers) are issues that we will continue taking up just as we will continue negotiating for a wage hike,? AITUC leader Dasgupta said.

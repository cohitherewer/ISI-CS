 Tech leap with TCS venture

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 14: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and the State Bank of India are together setting up C-Edge Technologies, which will provide advanced technology solutions and world-class domain consulting for the banking and financial services sectors. 

 The initial equity capital invested by TCS and the State Bank will be in the ratio of 51:49 and aggregate Rs 40 crore. 

 They (TCS) are the technology providers and we (SBI) are the implementors, said SBI chairman A.K. Purwar at a joint press meet with TCS chief S. Ramadorai. 

 The State Bank of India has built a huge domain knowledge in banking and insurance and we now propose to put value to that knowledge, said Purwar. 

 The SBI chief was referring to the fasttrack computerisation programme at SBI that saw 6690 branches getting connected through core banking solutions, enabled inhouse, with inputs from TCS. 

 The joint venture will develop high-value niche assets and solutions by leveraging domain and technology capabilities of the two parent companies. These new assets will complement and leverage TCS comprehensive suite of banking assets. 

 Ramadorai has been associated with the project to get SBI running on computer technology way back in 1974. He was present when the first Tata Burroughs computer was installed at SBIs Worli branch in Mumbai. 

 The move by TCS and State Bank follows a pattern set by Citibank, which has spawned outfits like e-Serve and invested in companies such as Polaris Software in the past. 

 Well look at some cutting edge technologies, said Ramadorai. The new company, Ramadorai hopes, will become profitable in two to three years.

 The move to align with its biggest customer in the local banking space follows TCS recent acquisition of FNS, a banking products company from Australia. C-Edge will play a key role in deploying banking products from Sydney-based Financial Services Network Services (FNS). 

 FNS products will be the preferred systems integrator in the new joint venture and leverage the experience both organisations have gained in the core banking roll-out in the SBI group, TCS said. 

 FNS, whose main product helps automate a banks operations, mainly caters to larger companies in emerging markets. 

 State Bank and TCS have a long tradition of working well together and this relationship will now on focus on developing cutting edge financial technologies, Ramadorai said. 

 The SBI group has excellent banking technology professionals and this venture with TCS will give it a platform to exploit their domain knowledge to create exciting new solutions and add great value to the new firms implementation capabilities, Purwar added.

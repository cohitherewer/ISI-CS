 Infy trio makes a killing in second ADS offer

 Nilekani, Narayana Murthy and Gopalakrishnan: Quite a threesome

 Mumbai, May 24: Make way Richie Rich, here come the big three. The three founders of Infosys Technologies are laughing all the way to the bank having sold a part of their shares in the companys second ADS offering.

 Chief mentor N R Narayana Murthy has gained a whopping Rs 462 crore, CEO Nandan Nilekani struck a Rs 320-crore booty, while S Gopalakrishnan, the chief operating officer, went home with Rs 310 crore by selling a fraction of their shareholding in the company they founded.

 They have together earned Rs 1,539 crore, the company said in a report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 A large portion of their holdings is believed to have accrued during the 1994 stock option plan. Sebi was yet to formulate the rules governing stock options then.

 The 1994 stock option plan was granted to employers at Rs 12.5 per share.

 Narayana Murthy, the largest employee-shareholder of Infosys, will continue to own 6.01 per cent, down from the earlier 6.58 per cent. 

 After the sale of 10.76 lakh shares, Nilekanis holding has come down to 4.17 per cent from 4.57 per cent. S Gopalakrishnan sold 10.42 lakh shares and his stake has been cut to 4.04 per cent from 4.42 per cent.

 Larry Lee Pressler, the US senator on the board of Infosys, did not miss out on the opportunity to sell a few shares from his kitty. He sold 653 from the 8000 shares that he holds in Infosys. 

 Omkar Goswami, Rama Bijapurkar and Deepak Satwalekar have, however, retained their shares as independent directors.

 Infosys boasts of a record 36,750 attendance on a given day, which begins with opportunity and ends in achievement.

 Speed, agility and excellence are the hallmarks of the company, an annual report states. We processed 14,13,018 job applications and conducted 47,467 interviews. It resulted in 14,981 new Infoscions.

 Even as we achieve a meteoric rise, we create manageable clusters to keep alive the small company feel, the report said.

 The three top officials ? Narayana Murthy, Nilekani and Gopalakrishnan ? try to retain their middle class attitude, it added.

 However, their ambitions for Infosys can be compared only with the biggest mega-corporates around. Wal-Mart, Dell and Toyota have grown with great regularity to become leaders in their segments. 

 The Infosys business model is founded on creating a global platform for delivering intellectual output that solves business problems in diverse industries across the world, the annual report for 2004-05 says.

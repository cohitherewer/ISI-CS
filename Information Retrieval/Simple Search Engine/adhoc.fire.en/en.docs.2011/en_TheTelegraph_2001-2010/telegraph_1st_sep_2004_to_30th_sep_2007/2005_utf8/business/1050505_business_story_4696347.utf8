 Assam cracker unit hits a roadblock

 S. P. S. PANNU

 New Delhi, May 4: The Rs 5,285-crore proposal for the Assam gas cracker project has run into rough weather. The finance ministry has held back its approval and has asked the petroleum ministry and the department of chemicals and petrochemicals to take a closer look at the economic viability of the project.

 A senior official told The Telegraph that the finance ministry wants ?their clear views on the relevance and viability of the project as it entails a large investment and has to be supported by huge subsidies and tax concessions.?

 Senior finance ministry officials were not impressed by the Gail?s presentation at the meeting of the Public Investment Board held recently to consider the project. 

 The proposal had been cleared by both the petroleum ministry and the department of chemicals and petrochemicals.

 Gail?s proposal lacks clarity, the ministry said. It wants the gas major to clearly spell out the extent and nature of support required to make the project commercially viable. Gail has been asked to take into consideration all the concessions that are already available to the Northeast under the existing industrial policy package and then work out the additional sops required. 

 The finance ministry expects the free trade agreement with ASEAN to affect the project and, therefore, wants a financial analysis that takes into account the possibility of increased foreign competition due to the scaling down of import duties.

 The Gail proposal did not indicate the status of the environmental clearance for the project and the petroleum ministry has been asked to ensure that this aspect is taken care of before the next meeting of the investment board. 

 The finance ministry feels that Rs1, 983-crore capital subsidy required for the project may not be justified as the cracker has a low employment potential. It has pointed out that if the money is directly utilised for health, education and roads it would be of greater benefit to the region. 

 Gail has been asked to look into the feasibility of the project at a lower internal rate of return of 8 per cent instead of 12 per cent as this would lower the amount of capital subsidy required for the project. 

 However, a senior Gail official told The Telegraph that the subsidy would have to be paid over a period of five years. This would make it more feasible for the government to undertake the project.

 As far as the excise and sales tax waivers are concerned, Gail officials feel that the central and state governments are not getting these taxes in any case and the only direct outgo from the government coffers would be the subsidy element. 

 Customs duty exemptions for importing equipment have also been extended in the past to set up new projects such as the Reliance refinery in Jamnagar, a senior Gail official pointed out.

 The gas cracker project, proposed to come up at Lepetkata in Dibrugarh district, proposes to use both natural gas and naphtha as raw material. The plant would produce 1.10 lakh tonnes of high-density polyethylene and another 1.10 lakh tonnes of low-density polyethylene. It would also produce polymers, raw pyrolysis gas and some fuel oil. 

 The petrochemicals unit, which was initially planned as part of the political package for the state under the Rajiv Gandhi accord, did not see the light of day as Reliance Industries had backed out of the project. Now with the Congress government in power at the centre the project has bounced back into contention.

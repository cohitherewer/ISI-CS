 Panel steps on the gas for pipeline

 Grid supply 

 Calcutta, May 15: The parliamentary standing committee on petroleum and natural gas has recommended that a national gas grid (NGG) should be developed under government control soon to ensure even gas supplies.

 Dipankar Mukherjee, a Rajya Sabha MP and a member of the House panel, said the grid should be developed along the lines of the existing power network to remove what he called regional imbalances in gas across the country.

 Like power, gas is part of the national infrastructure and, therefore, should be under government control, Mukherjee said. A grid will benefit the gas-starved east, where industry uses more expensive fuels like naphtha and coal.

 Mukherjee said Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has written to petroleum and natural gas minister Mani Shankar Aiyar to speed up the national grid.

 The panel has discussed the thorny issue of allowing private firms in building the pipeline, an area where public sector company Gail has been lobbying to retain its stranglehold on building, operating and maintaining such grids.

 The company is of the view that globally, only one agency, mostly government-owned, develops cross-country high-pressure gas pipelines, except in the US. It argued that multiple pipelines on the same route would lead to under-utilisation and, therefore, a waste of resources.

 Mukherjee, however, argues that private firms will not take care of the regional imbalances. They could be more concerned with gas for captive consumption, he added. 

 He said states like Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand should also get a share of the gas produced at Bombay High.

 If the national gas grid is not laid, the industry will continue to suffer from high fuel costs even as some in other parts of the country prosper. To create a level-playing field, the government should prepare a concrete plan and execute it with its own agency, Mukherjee said.

 The government has, however, justified allowing private companies like Reliance into laying pipelines, saying they did not completely own the source of the natural gas. Oil exploration and production is the most globalised and liberalised part of the Indian petroleum industry. The centre has to ensure that a limited number of players in transportation and distribution of gas does not inhibit competitive forces, a government source said. 

 The national gas grid will see the development of 8,000 km high-pressure pipelines at an investment of Rs 20,000 crore.

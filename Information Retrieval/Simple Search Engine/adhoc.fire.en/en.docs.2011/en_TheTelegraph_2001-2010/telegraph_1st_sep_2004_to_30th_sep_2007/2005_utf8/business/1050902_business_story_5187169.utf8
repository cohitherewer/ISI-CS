 IOC closes in on Turkish firm

 S.P.S PANNU

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is taking on Shell and Total for a majority stake in Turkish oil refining company Tupras. IOC will put in a qualifying bid tomorrow jointly with Cellec ? a Turkish company with a presence in energy and textiles businesses.

 There are eight companies in the fray for the 51 per cent stake of Tupras ? the second largest refining company in Turkey with a capacity of 28 million tonnes.

 The companies shortlisted after the qualifying round will participate in an open auction for the Tupras stake.

 An official told The Telegraph that the IOC team, led by director (business development) N.K. Nayyar and director (finance) S.V. Narasimhan, has left for Turkey with some petroleum ministry officials. IOC is keen on investments abroad as it will get an opportunity to operate in an open-market economy free of price controls.

 Although IOC has plunged into the red for the first time, we cannot let the single-quarter loss deter the company from pursuing its long-term business strategy, an official said. 

 Refining margins in overseas refineries are much higher than at home and acquiring a stake in Tupras will enable IOC to boost its bottomline.

 IOC officials also expect the revival package for the downstream oil marketing companies to come through soon as the Prime Ministers Office has stepped in to sort out the matter.

 Funds for the deal were not a problem as IOC has huge cash reserves and a very low debt-equity ratio, the official said. This will enable the company to easily raise loans from the market if it wants to do so. The company also owns a chunk of ONGC shares, which it can offload in the market to raise funds if required, he added.

 With the monsoon session of Parliament being over and international crude prices having skyrocketed to unprecedented levels, company officials expect the government to allow them to increase the prices of petroleum products.

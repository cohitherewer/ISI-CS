 New Delhi Nov. 1: The government is planning to spend more on e-governance. By the end of this year, the Centre is likely to spend Rs 3,014 crore on e-governance, up 37 per cent from Rs 2,200 crore spent in 2004.

 The Skoch survey that examined the implementation of e-governance projects, defined it as electronic delivery of government services to citizens and businesses in a reliable, timely and transparent manner and not just computerisation of a government department.

 ?In the next two years, most of the increased IT spending is likely to be channelled for rural projects, education, panchayati raj, common service centres and communications connectivity, said Sameer Kochhar, CEO of Skoch Consultancy Services.

 He said the data collected for the two e-governance report cards indicate that to sustain the growth in e-governance, the government must ensure that projects are replicated widely and quickly.

 The second report is based on intensive one-to-one interviews with about 350 citizens across seven states that included Punjab, Sikkim, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Assam, Andhra Pradesh and Bengal.

 The report focused on measuring the outcomes and rated top 16 projects in the country on the basis of concrete deliverables to citizens. 

 All 16 projects were carefully pre-qualified by a panel of experts. Each project has been rated on 14 parameters ? from reduction in corruption to ease of use. 

 ?The Skoch e-Governance Report Card 2005 was prepared after eight months of research, which included field visits to various e-governance sites spread across the country, interfacing with citizens and collecting first-hand feedback,? Kochhar said.

 The report noted that some of the pilot projects are being replicated enthusiastically and the citizen approval is similar to benefits reported from the original projects. But it also suggested that there is a need for quick replication to keep up the momentum.

 ?For example, land records at Hooghly in Bengal this year got an approval rating of 7.6 on a scale of 10 compared with a rating of 7.2 for a similar project in Uttaranchal last year. Sarita, the property registration project in Maharashtra, got a rating of 8.3 last year compared with a rating of 8.2 for a similar project in rural Shimla this year,? Kochhar said. 

 Some of these initiatives are now covered under the Department of Information Technology Replication Projects that extend to over 35 districts/projects.

 The survey noted that rural projects are getting high citizen approval. Suwidha in Punjab and Rural e-Seva in Andhra Pradesh have been rated at 8.9 ? the highest rating nationally.

 This year, 16 projects got an overall citizen approval score of 8.3 out of 10, which is substantially higher than last time, when 21 projects got a score of 7.6. 

 The report said this year the decline in corruption scores 8.6 (on a scale of 1-10) compared with 8.1 last year. Alignment with user expectation is up from 7.5 last year to 9.0 this year.

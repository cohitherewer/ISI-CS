 Reliance call rates under scanner

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Time for hard talk 

 New Delhi, March 30: The telecom regulator has raised doubts about Reliance Infocomm?s low tariff rates in Calcutta, Bengal, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, Mumbai and Maharashtra. The regulator wants to know if the rates are anti-competitive.

 The tariff plans under scrutiny are Plan 700, which offers unlimited talk time to Reliance phones across India and Plan 435, which offers unlimited talk time to Reliance phones across two circles ? Calcutta-Bengal, Chennai-Tamil Nadu and Mumbai-Maharashtra.

 The issue was brought to the notice of the regulator by cellular operators who felt these two Reliance tariff plans were violating the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India?s orders released last year. 

 Trai had stated in the order: ?Any differential tariff assuming the nature of vertical price squeeze?. will not be permitted ?? and that ?service providers shall conduct a self-check of existing tariff in view of the above guidelines and if any scheme in operation is inconsistent with these guidelines, the same shall be immediately withdrawn under intimation to the authority.?

 The regulator, in its telecom tariff order (TTO), has clarified that vertical price squeeze is a recognised anti-competitive practice that may be engaged by an operator with significant market power. 

 In cases of vertical price squeeze, where the retail rate is lower than the (wholesale) figure offered to operators, Trai would continue to intervene since a situation unfairly limits competition.

 The Cellular Operators Association of India (Coai) in its letter sent on March 24 has pointed out that Reliance is an operator with significant market power and by offering tariff plans with ?unlimited? talktime to its customers across different service areas, it is resorting to predatory pricing.

 ?It is submitted that these tariffs are predatory as the same rates are not transparently available to the other access providers. We believe that by offering such tariffs, Reliance is squeezing the margins of its competitors. It has lowered its retail tariffs of competitive services in the downstream market while not extending this facility to its competitors for wholesale prices (carriage charges) in the upstream market,? the representation said.

 T. V. Ramachandran, director-general of Coai, said: ?It is a clear case of treating STD calls as local calls and we have sought intervention of the telecom regulator since Trai itself had stated that no predatory pricing would be allowed. So we have requested them to direct the operator concerned to immediately withdraw the predatory tariff plans.?

 Reliance Infocomm executives refused to comment on the issue.

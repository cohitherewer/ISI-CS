 Shine back in bonds 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 26: Government bonds today rallied on a fresh wave of buying spurred by the Reserve Bank of Indias status quo policy to maintain growth momentum of the economy for 2005-06 by keeping key interest rates unchanged. 

 Select securities surged over 120-200 paise on frenzied buying; yields tumbled over 15 basis points. 

 Bond market dealers say there is enough liquid money (read cash) in the market and the government borrowing this year will be less than what was estimated earlier. 

 The current assessment of the macroeconomic outlook and the overall stance remains broadly unchanged from the annual statement made by the central bank in April this year. 

 The apex bank not only didnt change the bank rate, which currently rules at 6 per cent, it also left the reverse repo rate unchanged at 5 per cent. The market, however, had discounted speculation of a possible 25 basis points hike. The repo rate was last hiked in April, by 0.25 per cent.

 The benchmark 10-year paper ? 7.38 per cent 2015 stock ? shot up by over 120 paise to Rs 102.74/81 with the yield plunging by 17 paise to 6.99 per cent. The 9-year paper ? 7.37 per cent 2014 bond ? surged to Rs 103.08/18 from Rs 101.50/55 yesterday. The 10.25 per cent 2021 security spurted to Rs 125.85/95 from Rs 122.92/123.00.

 Stock surge

 The BSE sensex today gained another 47 points to end at yet a new peak of 7552.77. The flow of foreign investments in equity remained unabated and operators were hurrying to square up their short-sold positions. 

 The bank shares led the rally. The bank share index (bankex) rose 94 points to close at 4604.84.

 metaljunction ups target

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 19: The online trading company for steel and coal, metaljunction.com, is aiming at Rs 8,000 crore transaction through its platform during the current financial year.

 The Tata Steel-SAIL joint venture has carried out transactions worth Rs 2,200 crore during the six months ended September 30, 2005.

 Encouraged by the growing trade volume, the company has set a higher target for the rest of the year and plans to include cement trading, too. 

 We have started talking to some cement manufacturers for trading on our platform, said Viresh Oberoi, managing director, metaljunction Services Ltd.

 Well start working on it (cement trade) during this fiscal only, he said at a press meet here today.

 Oberoi admitted that the transaction target the company has for this fiscal would be a difficult challenge to meet. But, if the trade in cement and coal picks up, it can be achieved, he added.

 The company is also starting two new initiatives ? online store and aggregated rate contract. 

 The online store, which will come up in the next five months, will primarily deal in steel to begin with. In this system, sellers and buyers will strike deal and the product will also be delivered at the customers doorstep. This is expected to reduce number of intermediaries in the entire system leading to savings of more than 10 per cent to both the parties. The service will start from November 1 in Calcutta and then be taken to other cities of the country. 

 metaljunction will also arrange the logistics for delivery.

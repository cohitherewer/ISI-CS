 Energy panel report in a month

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 14: The committee on synergy in energy, set up to look into the restructuring of public sector oil companies, is expected to submit its reports in four weeks.

 The members of the committee, headed by V Krishnamurthy, met petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar recently in this regard. 

 The committee said it would take into account the existing setup of the oil companies and make practical recommendations for implementation.

 A senior member said the focus of the discussion had been on upstream oil exploration and production. The need to boost research and development in the hydrocarbon sector was also deliberated upon, he added.

 The committee will look into the merger issue of the national oil companies into two monolithic corporations so that the new companies have a higher critical mass to take on global competition effectively. 

 The petroleum ministry has already asked Oil India (OIL) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) to work closely towards the acquisition of oil assets abroad. A closer co-operation between the two companies will enable OIL to leverage the financial muscle of IOC, while the latter will be able to avail of the upstream expertise of OIL.

 The ministry has also initiated a move to enable the two companies to take fast-track decisions for acquiring hydrocarbon assets abroad in the same manner as ONGC-Videsh. This is considered essential given the fierce competition.

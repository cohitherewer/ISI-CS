 Godrej to restructure group firms

 Mumbai, July 26 (PTI): Godrej Industries chairman Adi Godrej today said the company might look at restructuring, including pumping in more funds, of some of its loss making subsidiaries like Godrej Tea.

 We are expanding our operations are also looking at acquisitions to organically enter manufacturing in some countries, he said at the companys AGM here. 

 The company is planning to increase its Natures Basket outlets in Mumbai as well as other cities.

 Godrej said the companys Vikhroli unit would turnaround soon due to reduction in octroi taxes on certain items ? from 5.5 per cent to 3 per cent ? by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. 

 Godrej shareholders have approved further investments in Avestha Gengraine Technologies Pvt Ltd and Cbay Systems Ltd, USA.

 The company had proposed to invest Rs 5 crore in the Bangalore-based contract research company Avestha and Rs 20 crore in Cbay.

 Godrej Industries has reported a net profit of Rs 12.01 crore for the quarter ended June 2005 against a loss of Rs 6.35 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. The total income increased by 12 per cent to Rs 187 crore.

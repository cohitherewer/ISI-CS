 Orissa focus on infrastructure

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, April 22: The Orissa government has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Infrastructure Leasing amp; Financial Services (IL amp;FS) to develop infrastructure.

 The agreement was signed between Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (Idco) chairman-cum-managing director L. N. Gupta and IL amp;FS vice-president Sunil Bahl.

 The agreement is in keeping with the public-private partnership route of development enshrined in the State Industrial Policy, 2001. The partnership will function under the overall guidance of a project development committee headed by chief secretary Subas Pani.

 Under the pact, IL amp;FS will provide services relating to project development, implementation, preparation of proposals and process management to access funds from the Centre.

 The partnership will also enable the Bhubaneswar Development Authority and other departments like housing and urban development, tourism, IT, water resources, energy and works to develop and implement infrastructure projects.

 IL amp;FS, an investment banking institution to develop infrastructure projects on a commercial format, is partnering with Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Tripura and Kerala.

 The Orissa government has already asked the Centre for immediate assistance in developing roads and railways to provide support to the steel, alumina and petrochemical facilities coming up in the state.

 Orissa is considering developing 41 steel projects, including 6 mega projects of over 3 million tonnes per annum capacity, three alumina projects and one petrochemical project. In a presentation before the Planning Commission, state officials said the condition of several link roads was bad. Four-laning and six-laning of these roads were necessary, they added. 

 It has also asked the Centre to provide Rs 1,000-1,200 crore over and above the railway budget in the next 3-4 years to help develop the railway infrastructure in the state. Two of the rail projects identified by the Orissa government, namely Daitari-Banspani and Haridaspur-Paradip, have been taken up for implementation by Rail Vikas Nigam Limited.

 Yellow metal shines in dollar march

 Owner?s pride

 Gold prices are at a 24-and-a-half-year high. But, while gold has traditionally been viewed as a hedge against a falling dollar and against inflation, the strange thing this time is that gold prices have been rising sharply in spite of a stronger dollar. What?s more, oil prices have fallen from their peak, which means inflation looks much more benign. Also, ?core? inflation, that is inflation less volatile fuel and food prices, has remained low. So, why is everybody turning to gold? Also consider that European central banks have sold gold worth euro 1.36 billion since September, and have been net sellers throughout the year. But that has not stopped gold prices from rising. 

 Several reasons for the rally have been offered, including that of supply and demand, the problems with augmenting supply from mines, rising jewellery demand from the fast-growing Indian and Chinese economies, the announcements by the Russian, South African and Argentine central banks that they will diversify their reserves by holding more gold, the hope that Asian central banks will follow suit, investment of petrodollars into gold and so on. But it?s useful to remember that it?s not just gold that?s rising in price ? most other commodities are too. That points to a speculative build-up, which has driven prices so high. It?s probable that the shift of investment to gold has much to do with the current disenchantment with the euro. As oil prices stabilise, interest rates rise and the euro becomes more attractive, the speculative rally in gold could fizzle away. 

 Value of local brokerages

 The high value that Merrill Lynch puts on the Indian market can be gauged not only by its decision to increase its stake in DSP Merrill Lynch from 40 per cent to 90 per cent but also from the price that it?s willing to pay for the acquisition. The deal values the company at Rs 2044 per share, or 35 times the earnings for calendar year 2004. But DSP Merrill?s earnings for the quarter ended September were Rs 20.13 per share, and they showed a year-on-year growth rate of 43 per cent. On that basis, the company is being bought at around 25 times calendar 2005 earnings. 

 That is a price easily worth paying, considering the extensive pipeline of mandates that the company has in a red-hot IPO market. Perhaps more significantly, while foreign banks will have to wait till 2009 to spread their wings in India, other parts of the financial pie (apart from the purely banking one) are up for grabs. Foreign players are dominant in the FII trades and it?s likely that this share will increase, given the increasing number of FIIs being registered. Foreign players are also a major force in investment banking, again a trend that will strengthen in view of the number of issues being floated abroad. 

 That is true not only for equities but for debt and convertible placements as well. And finally, foreign players have floated NBFCs that have tapped into the high-growth consumer finance business. 

 Yet another way of looking at how attractive the Indian market has become can be gauged from the fact that while the US firm paid $30 million for 40 per cent of DSP?s stake years ago, it will now pay $500 million for another 50 per cent of the company.

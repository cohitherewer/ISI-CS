 Co-op bank merger rules set 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 2: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today issued guidelines to facilitate urban co-operative banks? mergers and acquisitions. 

 Under the guidelines, the RBI would consider merger proposals of urban co-operative banks where the net worth of the bank being acquired was positive and the acquirer agreed to protect the interest of all depositors.

 It would also look at merger proposals where the net worth of the acquired bank is negative but the buyer assures to protect the depositors of the weak bank.

 The central bank will also consider proposals where the acquiring bank assures to protect the deposits of the bank with a negative net worth with financial support from the state government.

 A co-operative bank could merge only with a similar entity situated in the same state or registered under the multi-state co-operative societies, the central bank added in its policy guidelines.

 In all the cases of consolidation, the financial parameters of the acquirer after the merger would have to conform to the prescribed minimum prudential and regulatory requirements for urban co-operative banks.

 ?The realisable value of assets would have to be assessed through due diligence,? the RBI said. 

 While considering such proposals, the RBI would confine itself to the financial aspects of the merger, depositors? interests and stability of the financial system, it added.

 An application for merger with the proposed scheme would have to be submitted by the banks concerned to the state registrar of societies and Central Registrar of Societies.

 The acquirer bank would also forward a copy of the scheme, valuation report and other relevant information to the central bank.

 The RBI would convey its decision to the registrar of societies in the state concerned and to the central body when the acquirer is a multi-state co-operative bank.

 Registrars would ensure that the due process prescribed in the statutes has been complied before they seek the approval of the central bank, the policy guidelines said.

 Registrars would also ensure compliance with the statutory procedures to notify the amalgamation after obtaining the sanction of the central bank, it added.

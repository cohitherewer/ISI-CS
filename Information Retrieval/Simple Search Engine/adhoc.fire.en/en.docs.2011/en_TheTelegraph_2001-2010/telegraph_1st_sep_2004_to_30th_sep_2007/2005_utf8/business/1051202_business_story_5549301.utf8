 New Delhi, Dec. 1: ONGC chairman Subir Raha, who has come under fire from the petroleum ministry for not fully concentrating on the core business of oil exploration, today said 95 per cent of the companys investible corpus of Rs 14,354 crore for the next fiscal has been earmarked for domestic oil hunt. 

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar had criticised Raha for diverting ONGCs focus to non-core businesses like petrochemicals and power at the cost of its core business of oil exploration and production (E amp;P).

 Raha, whose extension as ONGC chairman is being considered by the government, told reporters, We have stepped up our investment in E amp;P. Our investments in exploration has more than tripled over the last two years and reached the optimal level.

 While ONGC had spent Rs 4,041 crore on domestic exploration in 2001-02, it has earmarked up to Rs 12,251 crore this fiscal. However, Rs 485 crore has been allocated for diversification plans in 2005-06.

 In the next fiscal, Rs 13,580 crore will be invested in E amp;P and only Rs 774 crore has been set aside for other related businesses, Raha said. 

 The companys diversification plans are not at the cost of E amp;P spending. We have sufficient internal resources to meet our commitments, Raha said.

 ONGC would produce 26.88 million tonnes of crude oil in 2005-06, which is more than a million tonne less than 28.13 million tonnes produced last year. The company expects to increase its crude output to 29.09 million tonnes in 2006-07.

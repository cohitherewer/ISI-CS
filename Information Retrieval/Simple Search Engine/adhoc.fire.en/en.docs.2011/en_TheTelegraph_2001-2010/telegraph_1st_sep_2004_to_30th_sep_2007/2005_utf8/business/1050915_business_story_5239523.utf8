 Bharti lines up offers for small firms

 M RAJENDRAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The Bharti Group is targeting the Rs 1000-1500 crore small and medium-sized business units with its bouquet of telecom and information technology services. An exclusive business unit will be set up at an investment of Rs 50-75 crore to service this segment.

 Small and medium business (SMB) enterprises are units with an annual turnover of Rs 3-10 crore and an employee strength of less than 50.

 Bharti plans to synergise its various telecom services like fixed and mobile, and offer all products and services through a single window to the SMB segment.

 The company has roped in an old hand in the industry, Mohan Menon, to head this unit. He has joined the group as chief executive officer and would report to Badri Agarwal, president of Bharti Infotel.

 Menon has worked with Motorola International Inc as its vice president and director of distribution for Southeast Asia and India.

 The new unit has been christened Small and Medium Business Services under the Infotel division. The data business related to SMEs will be brought under this unit. Currently, it is managed by the Enterprise Services.

 Sources in Bharti Infotel said, This is a virgin area. This sector has remained untapped and was largely dependent upon grey market operators for the supply of IT and telecom equipment. SME has a potential for about 7 million customers in India.

 It is a good opportunity for us to become the first mover and take the maximum advantage of our experience in the enterprise business in offering integrated telecom and networking solutions, sources said.

 They also pointed out that the company would be able to leverage its alliances with IT companies for hardware and software. The new unit will be similar to the existing AirTel Enterprise business unit.

 Present tense, future secure

 Mutual funds offer plans to secure a child?s future. Chandralekha Tulal surveys the field

 Your child is the apple of your eye and you would do everything possible to secure his or her future. 

 In an uncertain investment climate, it has become necessary for parents to become a little more savvy about the options before them while trying to secure the future of their children. The good old days when assured return schemes provided a return of 12 to 15 per cent are gone forever ? and with them the comforting thought for parents that they didn?t need to worry after plonking down the money.

 To alleviate interest rate blues, some mutual fund houses have come out with schemes that are designed for children. Typically, these funds advocate investing when children are a few months old and staying invested till they become adults so that the capital appreciation of the investments can be used to finance their ambitions. 

 What?s on offer

 At present, there are 13 such schemes on offer from nine fund houses. 

 This may appear to restrict your choice but it is actually a blessing as you dont have to pore over the fine print of loads and schemes before making an informed decision on which one suits your child best.

 Debt-equity balance

 All the schemes are a balance of equity and debt, except UTI Children Career Plan Bond, which is a pure debt fund. However, the balanced funds have varying proportions of equity and debt, based on the risk-return matrix. 

 For example, HDFC Children?s Gift Fund has two plans ? Investment (with a higher equity allocation) and Savings (with a higher debt component). 

 Prudential ICICI also gives two options: Childcare Gift (equity-oriented) and Study (debt-oriented). 

 Averse to equity?

 One should not view investments in equity with trepidation even if one is extremely risk-averse. One must remember that this is an investment for one?s child and not for oneself. For a child, a higher equity component is better as age is on the right side. 

 But what is the logic of investing in such specific schemes when there is a gamut of diversified equity and balanced funds that seek to provide long-term capital appreciation for investors? 

 Though similar to balanced funds, either equity or debt-oriented, the differentiating factor in a child plan is the selection of stocks and the churn in the portfolio. 

 The fund manager of a child plan picks companies that display long-term potential as opposed to short-term upsides, which other balanced funds are keen to exploit.

 Locked in

 Moreover, child plans have a lock-in period ? a minimum of three years in most cases and in some others till the child attains 18 years of age. If the parent wishes to exit before then, he will incur a load, which is a deterrent factor for most investors. 

 Wealth chart

 The difference crops up when it comes to making actual long-term investments to generate wealth. Though a diversified equity or a balanced fund also declares its objective to be long-term capital appreciation, the fund manager does not really have the liberty to make equity investments over the long term. This is because the fund witnesses daily redemption pressure with investors constantly monitoring its performance. 

 Thus, often the fund manager is forced to make investments purely to clock short-term gain to keep investors satisfied.

 When we compare the performance of child plans with other balanced funds, there are not much differential returns that tilt in favour of the former. ?There are only three child plans which have been around for more than five years and all the three have posted annual returns between 11 and 15 per cent. Also, one has to keep in mind that most of the schemes maintain a low-risk return profile and are conservative in nature compared with their counterparts,? a fund analyst said. 

 How to choose

 The factors that determine the choice of a child plan are much the same as those for picking any other mutual fund. 

 The track record and the performance history of the fund are extremely important. Performance of other equity or balanced funds from the same mutual fund goes some way in establishing its competence in managing the child plan. 

 Be sure to look at the long-term performance over three to five years, as that is the time frame of investment you would be bound to opt for. 

 Since child plans are retail products, the corpus is not necessarily an important factor and while comparing child plans, make sure you are comparing like to like.

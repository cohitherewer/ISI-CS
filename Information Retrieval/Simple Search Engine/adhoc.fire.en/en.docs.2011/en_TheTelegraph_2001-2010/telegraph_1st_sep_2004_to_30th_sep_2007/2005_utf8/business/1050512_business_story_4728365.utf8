 Bertelsmann agrees to buy Columbia

 Frankfurt, May 11 (Reuters): German media conglomerate Bertelsmann is set to buy US direct CD seller, Columbia House, for $400 million to bolster its ailing club business in a deal it had walked away from four years ago.

 Bertelsmann agreed to buy Columbia, which had $800 million in sales last year, from private equity firm Blackstone and will add it to US CD seller BMG Direct, Bertelsmanns DirectGroup division has said.

 The club business, the root of Bertelsmanns rise to be the worlds fourth-largest media group, has struggled with an ageing and declining membership as people flock to the Internet to buy books or CDs. Its sales fell 5 per cent last year.

 Bertelsmann, with up to 3 billion euros under its belt for purchases, last month already bought French bookstore chain Privat in another deal to beef up DirectGroup, its least profitable unit.

 This once again clearly demonstrates that all signs at DirectGroup are pointing to growth following its successful turnaround, said Bertelsmann chief executive Gunter Thielen in a letter to employees, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters.

 British Petroleum in ?10bn funding recce

 S.P.S PANNU

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: British Petroleum (BP) could invest up to ?10 billion in the Indian hydrocarbon sector if it finds the right possibilities.

 The British oil companys response to Indian diplomatic efforts has been formally conveyed to the petroleum ministry by the Indian High Commission in London, sources said. The letter says the British oil firm will invest the amount in phases.

 The ministries of petroleum and external affairs want BP to bring in finance and technical expertise to give a fillip to the oil and gas sector.

 Diplomatic efforts are on to get BP chief executive officer Lord Brown to visit India in October to get a first-hand feel of the countrys oil and gas business.

 BP has been in touch with the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) when oil and gas blocks were offered under the fifth oil hunt round this year. However, the UK giant is still not convinced that India is a key oil destination.

 An oil industry executive told The Telegraph that big companies like BP usually looked for discovered oil fields. If they undertake exploration, it is in proven areas of big finds.

 Hindustan Petroleum has also approached BP and some other multinationals like Total of France to pick up stakes in the Bhatinda refinery project and invest in the proposed expansion of the Vizag refinery.

 A senior HPCL official said the company had sent letters inviting these multinationals to invest but has not received any response yet. Cairn Energy of the UK has struck oil and gas in India at regular intervals but these discoveries are either medium or small. BP expects a big find if it carries out exploration in India.

 The government is, therefore, trying to showcase the Krishna Godavari basin gas finds, including those of Reliance and that of Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation. 

 ONGC has adopted the joint venture route and selected Cairn Energy as a partner in four of the seven blocks awarded to it under the Nelp 5 round. 

 It has also forged partnership with ENI of Italy in one of the blocks and will go it alone in only two.

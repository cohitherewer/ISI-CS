 Backoffice deals to dwindle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: Business process outsourcing (BPO) deals are likely to shrink both in terms of value and the period of contract, according to a report compiled by TPI Inc ? a sourcing advisory firm to Global 1000 organisations.

 TPI, which was an adviser to the deal inked today by ABN Amro and Infosys, Patni, Accenture and TCS, expects the quantum of BPO pacts to decrease from $10 billion to about $2-3 billion.

 It also forecasts that increasing external vagaries will force firms to go for deals of less than five years duration against the 8-10-year contracts that are common at present. TPI has published its initial findings on the state of global service delivery, based on analyses of more than 200 respondents in a comprehensive survey undertaken in mid-2005. 

 The report says global service delivery or offshoring is expected to grow during the next 18 months, particularly among companies with experience of three to five years.

 TPI also foresees a shift in outsourcing deals of European firms to countries in eastern Europe such as Hungary and Romania.

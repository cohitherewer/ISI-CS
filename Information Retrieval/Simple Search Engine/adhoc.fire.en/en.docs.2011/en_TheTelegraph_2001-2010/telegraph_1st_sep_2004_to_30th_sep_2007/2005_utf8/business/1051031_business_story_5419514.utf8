 Macmet eyes export boost

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Building blocks

 Calcutta, Oct. 30: The Neotias-promoted Macmet India has set its sights on a Rs 100-crore turnover in the near term.

 The project engineering company has a technological edge over competitors in solid bulk handling and water cleaning systems. It has recently concluded a fairly complicated, 2.4-kilometre long bulk material transportation system in ACCs Chaibasa plant.

 Macmet managing director P.K. Madappa said the company would concentrate more on the export market than at home as the company has the technologies comparable with the best of the world.

 Export income is already contributing 30 per cent of Macmets total turnover. We expect this to go up to 50 per cent going forward, Madappa added.

 The company has successfully bid few projects abroad and is currently executing a project in Singapore.

 We are primarily targeting at the West Asian countries. Small projects, like the one in Singapore, could be a stepping stone for bigger things to come, Madappa noted. 

 The water cleaning system, which is used by all industrial units requiring water without any floating or submerged particles, finds application mainly in the power and cement sectors, besides the civic infrastructure system.

 Calcutta-headquartered Macmet made Rs 35 crore profit last fiscal and has recently undertaken a restructuring of its manufacturing facility. 

 It is setting up a new unit each in Bengal and Andhra Pradesh at an investment of Rs 3 crore.

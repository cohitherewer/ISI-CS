 UBI keen to set off loss against capital

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 1: United Bank of India has put forward a proposal to the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank of India to allow it to adjust its accumulated loss of Rs 278 crore against its Rs 1811-crore paid-up capital.

 Adjustment of loss against capital forms part of the restructuring exercise that has been taken up by the bank.

 This will create room for raising capital by the bank. Reserves will also increase and market-related ratios will improve, said chairman and managing director P.K. Gupta.

 If the proposal is cleared by the government as well as the regulator, the bank will wait for RBI guidelines on capital rejig, Gupta said.

 The bank now has enough capital to meet Basell?II requirements. We have room to raise tier?II capital of Rs 900 crore, said executive director Sunanda Lahiri.

 Rating agency Icra will work out a credit risk model for the bank.

 The bank has registered a net profit of Rs 104 crore between April and September against Rs 103 crore in the year-ago period.

 Operating profit has increased to Rs 359 crore against Rs 336 crore in the previous year.

 The banks profit figures were adversely affected due to an increase in wage bill after a salary revision, additional provision for non-performing assets and depreciation on investments, said Gupta.

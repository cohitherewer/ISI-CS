 Calcutta, Oct. 17: Allahabad Bank has decided to go beyond the boundaries of the country by opening its first overseas branch in Hong Kong. It has already submitted the required papers to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.

 The bank is also mulling a second foreign branch in Shenzen in China.

 The Calcutta-headquartered bank today announced its financial numbers for the first half of the current fiscal. Its net profit for the April-September period increased by 9.27 per cent to Rs 331.33 crore from Rs 303.22 crore in the corresponding period last year. During the six months, the bank has done a business of Rs 68,933 crore. 

 Total income during the period stood at Rs 2068.09 crore compared with Rs 1958.53 crore a year earlier.

 Allahabad Banks trading profit, however, has plunged steeply to Rs 70.73 crore from Rs 306.71 crore in the year-ago period, resulting in a moderate growth in its earnings this year. 

 Addressing newspersons here today the banks chairman cum managing director, .N. Singh, said that a business target of Rs 80,000 crore has been set for the entire year against Rs 55,000 crore in the previous fiscal. He added that the bank aimed at a credit growth of 31 per cent and a 25 per cent deposit growth in 2005-06. We are aiming at an overall growth of 25 per cent in the second half, Singh added.

 He emphasised that Allahabad bank has become ready to meet the Basel II risk capital norms which will become effective from April 1, 2006 as its capital adequacy ratio (CAR) has improved significantly. The bank has a CAR of 13.32 per cent as on September 30, 2005, up from 12.74 per cent a year ago.

 The bank doesnt need to raise Tire I or Tier II capital as both are at a comfortable level, Singh said. 

 The bank has made a provisioning of Rs 140.46 crore as on September 30, 2005 as against Rs 140.46 crore in the corresponding period last year. The net non-performing asset of the bank has also come down to 0.67 per cent of net advances. 

 Singh said the bank would put special emphasis on technology and has identified 900 branches that would be brought under its core banking solution (CBS) programme. The bank has earmarked an investment of Rs 375 crore for this.

 Meanwhile, Allbank Finance, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allahabad bank, is all geared up to enter the general insurance business along with other joint venture partners.

 PNB plan

 Punjab National Bank will open new branches in Singapore, Canada and Hong Kong and convert its representative office in Lndon into a subsidiary. 

 We are going to convert our London representative office into a full-fledged subsidiary, PNB chairman S. C. Gupta told reporters in Dehradun today. 

 The PNB board has already given its sanction for opening branches abroad, but a decision in this regard is pending with RBI. 

 After RBI gives its clearance, PNB will approach central banks of the respective countries for licenses to start operation.

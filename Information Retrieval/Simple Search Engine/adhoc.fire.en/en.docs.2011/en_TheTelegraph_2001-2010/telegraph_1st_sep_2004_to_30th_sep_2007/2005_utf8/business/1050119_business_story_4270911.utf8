 Surveys see strong industry growth

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: India Inc is looking at strong growth this year. Two independent evaluations ? one by Dun and Bradstreet (D amp;B) and the other by Assocham ? indicate that industry is looking at the start of a go-go year.

 Projecting growth during the first quarter of 2005 (January-March), D amp;B says a majority of 84 per cent of the respondents expect sales volume to increase while only 3 per cent expected a downtick in sales. The optimism index for sales volume stands at 81 per cent compared with 69 per cent in the previous quarter.

 The D amp;B study asked respondents to state whether they expected an increase, decline or no change in six areas: net sales, net profit, selling prices, new orders, inventories, and employees.

 The report says optimism was highest in the services and capital goods segments. However, the basic goods sector was the least optimistic in the sales parameter.

 The optimism index for the ?selling prices? category stands at 21 per cent compared with 13 per cent in the previous quarter. The index was highest in the basic goods segment with nearly 45 per cent respondents anticipating an increase in prices.

 ?It was observed that in all segments, a large majority of respondents expect no change in the level of selling prices of the products,? said D amp;B.

 On the issue of increasing number of employees, about 44 per cent of the respondents said they intended to raise the staff strength, a growth of 21 percentage points over the previous quarter. The services sector was the most optimistic about raising the number of employees, while the capital goods industry was the least inclined to do so.

 On maintaining inventory levels, 27 per cent of the respondents expect the level of stock to increase, while just over 11 per cent predicted it would decline in the forthcoming quarter.

 The optimism index for inventory level stands at 16 per cent compared with 14 per cent in the previous quarter.

 The Assocham study took a more macro-economic perspective in its business barometer survey. Sixty-one per cent of the respondents said they expected double-digit growth in fiscal 2005-06 despite rising oil prices and increasing pressure on interest rates.

 Respondents were not apprehensive about the impact of a rising rupee on the economy though inflation remained a cause for concern.

 The Assocham survey said the sustainability of robust industrial growth would largely depend on the performance of the agriculture sector.

 Furore over ITC settlement

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 3: ITC Ltd continued to cause an uproar in Parliament, with members of the ruling alliance demanding the finance minister name the Opposition NDA leaders who had written seeking withdrawal of an ordinance to recover Rs 803 crore in tax arrears from the tobacco major. 

 Congress MP Pawan Kumar Bansal and other ruling alliance MPs who made the demand also sought to clarify whether the leaders were George Fernandes and Murli Manohar Joshi.

 However, Speaker Somnath Chatterjee refused to give any directions on naming the NDA leaders who had written to the finance minister and said it was up to the government to take any such decision. 

 Today?s uproar in Parliament where two NDA leaders were named by MPs as the possible letter writers seemed to be in response to the taunt made by BJP MPs yesterday.

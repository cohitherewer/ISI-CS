 Dabhol put on fast track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 11: The cabinet committee on economic affairs today accepted the recommendations of the empowered group of ministers to let the National Thermal Power Corporation and Gail restart the mothballed Dabhol power project.

 Parliamentary affairs minister Jaipal Reddy told reporters that all the recommendations of the GoM had been accepted. However, he did not divulge any further details as Parliament is in session. 

 The CCEA has approved ONGC-Videshs proposal to develop the oil exploration block 5A in Sudan. The company has been allowed to invest another $100 million in the Thar Jath field of the block. 

 Reddy said the CCEA has fixed the minimum support price of sugarcane at Rs 79.50 per quintal. 

 The petroleum ministry and the power ministry had sought the cabinets approval for Gail and NTPC to invest Rs 500 crore for a 28 per cent stake each in Ratnagiri Gas and Power, the special purpose vehicle floated to revive the Dabhol plant.

 According to this proposal, an IDBI-led consortium of financial institutions will pick up another 28 per cent stake for Rs 500 crore, while the Maharashtra State Electricity Board would get a 15 per cent share in the project. 

 Gail will source liquefied natural gas (LNG) for the project and set up the import terminal to bring the gas, while NTPC will run the plant. 

 Gail is confident of arranging the LNG supply by mid-2006 when the plant is expected to start generation. 

 It plans to import 5 million tonnes of LNG per annum at Dabhol, which could generate up to 5,000 mw of power. About 2.1 million tonnes of LNG will be used for running the plant. The remaining 2.9 million tonnes will be sold to other consumers in the energy-starved western region. 

 A team of Bhel, Gail and NTPC officials have already inspected the plant and found it in good shape despite being closed for the last five years. 

 Recently, a settlement was reached with US engineering and construction companies GE and Bechtel, who had a stake in the Dabhol plant set up by Enron corporation. This paved the way for restarting the power plant.

 According to Gail chairman Proshanto Banerjee, the cost estimates have been worked out to enable power from Dabhol plant to be supplied at Rs 2.30 per kwh. 

 However, all financial claims from GE and Bechtel would have to be settled before Ratnagiri Gas and Power could become operational.

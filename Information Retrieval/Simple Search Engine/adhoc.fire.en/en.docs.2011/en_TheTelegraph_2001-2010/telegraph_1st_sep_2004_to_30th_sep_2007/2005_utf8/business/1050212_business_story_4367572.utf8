 Boost to twin SAIL units 

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Feb. 11: The surge in demand for flat products has boosted the bottomline of two SAIL plants at Rourkela and Bokaro. 

 Rourkela Steel Plant, which suffered a net loss of Rs 193 crore in the first nine months of last fiscal, has turned around and has registered a net profit of Rs 554 crore in the first nine months of this fiscal.

 Bokaro Steel Plant, with a net profit of Rs 2,251 crore, is also fast catching up with SAIL flagship Bhilai Steel Plant?s net profit of Rs 2,366 crore.

 The two plants have collectively contributed Rs 2,805 crore to SAIL?s nine-month profit of Rs 5,739.05 crore. This is probably the first time in SAIL?s history that the two flat producing plants have almost matched the collective contribution of the two long producing plants ? Rs 2,840.69 crore by Bhilai and Durgapur.

 Between them the two flat producers of SAIL make 5.5 million tonnes of flat steel. Bokaro?s annual saleable steel output is 3.78 million tonnes, while Rourkela produces 1.67 million tonnes.

 Overriding the initial lull in production due to erratic coal supply, the plants have managed to speed up production in subsequent months and maintain last year?s average monthly production rate. Bokaro has marginally increased its production.

 This measure helped fill the vacuum created in the domestic market by increased exports of HR and CR by private steel producers. Bokaro increased its production of HR coil from 12,56,300 tonnes up to third quarter of last fiscal to 14,35,100 tonnes in the corresponding period this fiscal. Likewise, HR plate production during the period increased to 3,59,100 tonnes compared with 2,75,100 tonne in the last fiscal.

 Bokaro has also increased the production of special steels used in auto components and LPG cylinder production that fetch a better price.

 Production of 1,47,000 tonnes of special steel for the first nine months in the last fiscal was increased 44 per cent to 2,12,000 tonne in the corresponding period of this fiscal.

 Twin buyouts to fortify Novartis

 Booster dose

 Zurich, Feb. 21 (Reuters): Novartis AG became the world?s biggest copy-cat drugs maker by agreeing to buy unlisted German firm Hexal and US company Eon Labs in a cash deal worth a total of more than $8 billion.

 Novartis will buy all of Hexal and 67.7 per cent of Eon Labs from Germany?s Struengmann family for 5.65 billion euros ($7.4 billion), it said on Monday, giving it a leading position in the major markets for generic versions of off-patent drugs. 

 The Swiss-based Novartis will also make a tender offer to buy the rest of Eon Labs for $31 per share at a cost of about $1 billion, and merge the two companies into its Sandoz unit, currently the worlds number 2 maker of generic drugs, it said. Eon Labs stock closed at $27.92 on Friday. 

 The deal will give Novartis access to high-margin versions of ?hard-to-make? branded drugs and the scale needed to reduce costs aggressively in a market marked by cut-throat competition and pressure on prices, analysts said. However, analysts said it was relatively expensive, at an estimated 3.5 to 4 times the combined sales of Hexal and Eon.

 Novartis shares rose after the news, and were trading 2.8 per cent higher at 58.90 Swiss francs at 1110 GMT. They slightly underperformed the broader European drug sector, however, which rallied after relatively benign recommendations from US regulators on so-called COX-2 painkillers on Friday. 

 Analyst Ben Yeoh of ABN Amro in London said the acquisition looked ?a little expensive,? but he added, ?Considering the deal is all cash, the returns are likely to be more than if it remained stuck on the balancesheet.?

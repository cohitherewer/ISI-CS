 New tax system to keep old savings out

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 24: The government today said the EET or exempt, exempt, tax system will be applicable to new savings and not existing ones. 

 Existing schemes will not be touched. Only new savings will come under the amendment, revenue secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar said. 

 The EET scheme, which was outlined in this years budget, will give tax-payers concessions when they put money in schemes like pension and provident funds, national savings scheme certificates but will tax these savings when they are finally withdrawn. 

 Chandrasekhar said the EET model was proposed to make sure there is some kind of balance between future consumption and savings. North Block had made it clear in the last budget that it wanted to move most tax-free savings towards the EET system. It had set up a five-member committee to study the issue soon afterwards. 

 At present, tax-free savings instruments such as PF, NSC are exempt from tax at all stages ?investment, accrual and withdrawal. In financial jargon this is described as exempt, exempt, exempt (EEE) system. Now the government now wants to tax savings at the withdrawal stage. 

 Chandrasekhar said the EET panel would submit its report shortly.

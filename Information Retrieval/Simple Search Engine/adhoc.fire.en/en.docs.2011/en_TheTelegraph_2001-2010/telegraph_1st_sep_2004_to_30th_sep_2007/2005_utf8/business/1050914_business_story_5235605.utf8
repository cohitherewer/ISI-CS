 Single energy regulator

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: The government is mulling a single regulator for the energy sector.

 The Planning Commission and the Committee of Secretaries (CoS) have given their consent for a single appellate tribunal for power, coal and petroleum sectors. While a single power regulator already exists, a regulator is required to sort out the problems of fuel linkage resulting in an imbalanced power tariff.

 An open discussion on power reforms held at Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) highlighted the need for a single regulator in the sector.

 There is a degree of agreement within the Committee of Secretaries that a separate appellate tribunal for the petroleum sector was not necessary. It makes no sense to regulate power tariffs when cost of fuel, which makes the major part of tariff, is not regulated, power secretary R.V. Shahi said.

 The Planning Commission has already supported the proposal of a single tribunal for power, coal and petroleum sectors. Shahi, however, clarified that it is an existing proposal that is being examined and that no formal decision has been taken.

 The government has set up an appellate tribunal for the power sector according to the Electricity Act in May.

 Currently, power tariffs are fixed by state regulators while the central regulator fixes the tariff for generation, transmission and distribution.

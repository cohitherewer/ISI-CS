 Multiple players for national gas grid

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Wider reach

 Calcutta, March 15: The government has decided to open the inter-state gas distribution system to multiple players.

 This will allow private and multinational companies to participate in the National Gas Grid (NGG) development while keeping Gail?s claim of a single operator at bay.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said the decision was justified given the fact that the government did not completely own the source of the natural gas.

 ?The exploration and production (E amp;P) sector is highly globalised and liberalised. We have to ensure that the competitive forces unleashed in this sector are not inhibited by lack of competition in gas transportation and distribution,? Aiyar said.

 Gail had strongly lobbied for monopoly in developing the 8,000-km long high-pressure NGG which entails an investment of Rs 20,000 crore.

 However, the minister now has put all speculation at rest.

 ?A Gail monopoly makes sense if the exploration and production is in government hands. Since this sector is opened up, it follows that transportation and distribution is also liberalised,? Aiyar added.

 The minister said at a time when cross-border pipeline networks from Myanmar and Iran were being considered, the NGG would become part of a large regional network.

 Since an international consortium with participation of Indian companies will develop these networks, the domestic sector needs to open up.

 However, he expressed hope that Gail would be ahead of competition in building the NGG as ONGC took lead in the exploration and production sector.

 The development augurs well for Reliance, which is considering developing a 1400-km pipeline connecting its giant gas find in Krishna-Godavari basin to the western markets. The pipeline plans to link Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh to Ahmedabad in Gujarat via Hyderabad and Uran in Maharastra. Gail also wanted to set up a pipeline in the same route.

 The public sector company argued that multiple pipelines on the same route will lead to sub-optimal use of capacity and waste of scarce resources.

 In fact, most countries have allowed a single agency to develop high-pressure inter-state gas pipelines, except the US. The UK, France, China, Turkey, Brazil and Argentina have encouraged single agency.

 Gail said it would offer open access to all users. Anyone can pump gas or suck it out according to their requirement. 

 Gail would only act as the transporter. Any producer or supplier of gas would book capacity in the pipeline and pay the transportation charge for using the pipeline.

 Private players argued that operators offering best tariff for transportation should be given the opportunity to lay the pipeline.

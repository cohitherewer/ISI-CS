 Cell firms take spectrum hit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 13: The telecom regulator today dented the hopes of Reliance and other CDMA players of stealing a march over cellular operators when it rejected their proposal to allocate airwaves in the controversial 1900 Mhz band.

 Releasing its recommendations on spectrum allocation, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) said the 1900 Mhz band could not be vacated by the defence services. Consequently, both the GSM and the CDMA players would be allocated airwaves in the IMT-2000 spectrum in the 2 Ghz band.

 The regulator also suggested that the spectrum charges paid by service providers should be lowered to 4 per cent of their gross revenues from 6 per cent at present. If the government accepts this recommendation, telecom tariffs could go down further.

 Both CDMA and GSM players were disappointed with the recommendations and came out with statements saying that the regulator had favoured the other side.

 The regulators suggestion that CDMA operators be given additional spectrum within a month without ensuring optimal use of existing assignments would help these players to immediately offer 3G/EVDO services through the back door, said T. V. Ramachandran, director-general of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI).

 Trai said it foresaw a shortage of 2G spectrum and wants a high-level group of ministers to deal with the issue in order to achieve the target of 200 million mobile subscribers by 2007.

 The two lobbies ? GSM and CDMA ? had claimed that the 1900 mhz band should be reserved for each of them to offer third generation mobile services. CDMA-based service providers, including Reliance Infocomm and Tata Teleservices, had said they needed the 1900 Mhz band for compatibility to equipment from overseas markets.

 Trai recognises that the US-PCS 1900 Mhz band for CDMA operators cannot be vacated by the defence department. Hence, even CDMA services will have to be allocated spectrum in the 2 Ghz band, the regulator said.

 The present spectrum allocation criterion for GSM and CDMA operators may be revised within a month of acceptance of these recommendations. Trai will see to it that while retaining the subscriber base approach, the quantum and steps for additional allocation and area of co-ordination are technology neutral. The authority said the constraints could be mitigated through introduction of services in the IMT-2000 spectrum.

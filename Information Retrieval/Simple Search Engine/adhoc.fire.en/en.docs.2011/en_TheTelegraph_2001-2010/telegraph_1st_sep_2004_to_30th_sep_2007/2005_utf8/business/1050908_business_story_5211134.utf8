 Gail in talks for stake in new KG basin discovery

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Banerjee: Focused

 Calcutta, Sept. 7: Gail (India) has expressed its intent to pick up a stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corporations (GSPCL) recent gas discovery in the Krishna-Godavari basin.

 Proshanto Banerjee, chairman and managing director of Gail, said the company was in parleys with GSPCL in this regard.

 The KG-1 block is believed to contain 20 trillion cubic foot (TCF) of gas, but it is yet to be ascertained by any agency.

 Speaking to reporters in Calcutta on Tuesday, Banerjee said the decision regarding its picking up a stake in the block would mostly depend upon GSPCL.

 It is more important how much stake GSPCL agrees to part with Gail than what we are asking for, Banerjee pointed out.

 Gail and GSPCL are currently working on three exploration blocks in the country. 

 In Cambay Onshore block ? a NELP-II block ? on the west coast, Gail and GSPCL have 40 per cent stakes each. Another company, JTI had a 20 per cent stake in the block. But the company has withdrawn from the venture. Its stake is likely to be shared equally by Gail and GSPCL. 

 Apart from that block, Gail and GSPCL are also working at a NELP -- IV block on Cauvery onshore. The two have stakes in another NELP-II block on Mumbai offshore.

 Gail is counting on this relationship with GSPCL for acquiring a stake in the KG Basin find, in which a few other companies also have evinced interest. 

 GSPCL has spent about Rs 250 crore in the drilling programme while another Rs 1,500 crore would be pumped in for further development of the KG Basin. 

 Going by the prospect and the development programme, Gail may have to shell out a hefty amount if GSPCL agrees to part with a stake in its new find.

 Gail is also wooing GSPCL to market the huge gas find.

 At present, the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation has only a 730-km long pipeline network in Andhra Pradesh to transport the Raava gas from the KG Basin. But the new find will require a much larger pipeline network.

 It is to be seen if GSPCL will let Gail to take the transportation and marketing as well.

 Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, who announced the discovery in June, said that the gas would be brought to Gujarat.

 This will require a cross-country pipeline network connecting the eastern coast to the western region.

 Moreover, the gas can be pumped into the Hazira-Vijapur-Jagdishpur pipeline for the northern market as well.

 Gail has also envisaged two more pipelines ? from Kakinada to Chennai and Calcutta ?to cater to the southern and eastern market, respectively.

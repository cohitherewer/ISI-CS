 Lever baton changes hands

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Banga: Making room

 Mumbai, June 24: Hindustan Lever (HLL) chairman M. S. Banga today passed the baton to H. Manwani, having signed off from a turbulent tenure in which he presided over a slump in sales and profits at the company.

 As night follows day, profit growth follows value growth, Banga reassured shareholders at the annual general meeting.

 Banga, responding to shareholders who were fretting about flagging sales and thinning bottomlines, stressed that the company was truly on the path of growth.

 India is one of the most exciting markets offering great potential. Over the next 10 years, the per capita income in India is likely to double. As a result, the FMCG market is expected to grow to over Rs 1,00,000 crore from its current base of Rs 40,000 crore. Our people are energised by the scale of the opportunity and determined to seize it, Banga told shareholders at the meeting. 

 Manwani, the man who will take over from Banga, will be the Hind Lever non-executive chairman. On the sidelines of the meeting, Manwani said his endeavour would be to make the firm one of the top three FMCG firms.

 Over the next 10 years, the FMCG market will be worth over Rs 1,00,000 crore compared with Rs 40,000 crore now. This is an opportunity we are poised to seize, Banga said.

 When a shareholder pointed out that recent years have also seen high attrition rates at Hind Lever, Banga argued the loss of executives was only around 5-6 per cent. This is a regular rate and not abnormal at all, he added.

 Banga alluded to HLL executives who have stayed back and had closed ranks to face the challenge. He also spoke of pressures. Well seek to alleviate such cost pressure through judicious price increases, he said.

 Banga denied that dividend was paid by dipping into the reserves account and added that the boards decision to pay dividend from the profit and loss account was a judicious one. We genuinely wish to protect our small shareholders. This also reflects our confidence in the future growth of the company.

 Protest call

 A section of HLL employees today staged a silent demonstration against the companys managements practices while the annual general meeting was on. 

 They wore aprons that said stop irrational war against HLL employees. They were protesting against the companys move to shift operations to Uttranchal to chase tax benefits and cheap wages. We have been offered VRS, but we want to work, a worker said.

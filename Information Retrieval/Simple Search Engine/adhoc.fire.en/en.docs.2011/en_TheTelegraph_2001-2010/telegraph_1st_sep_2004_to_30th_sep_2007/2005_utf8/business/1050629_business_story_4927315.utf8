 Panel to boost farm sector growth

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 28: The National Development Council (NDC) today decided to set up a sub-committee on agriculture to draw up a strategy to reverse the slowdown in the farm sector.

 Winding up the two-day meet, NDC chairman and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said, There is a broad agreement regarding the goals and policies suggested in the mid-term appraisal. These can act as a blue-print for further action on the Tenth Plan. It can also act as the starting point for work on the Eleventh Five-Year Plan.

 He directed the Planning Commission to prepare an approach paper for the Eleventh Plan by the year-end.

 Singh said the sub-committee, headed by agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, would address the issues plaguing the crucial sectors of agriculture and irrigation. The committee is expected to submit its report in the next six months so that its recommendations can be included in the approach paper.

 The Prime Minister asserted that India was capable of achieving a 7-8 per cent growth. The challenge lay in combining the economics of growth with equity and social justice, he added.

 Singh was optimistic that the country could prosper and get rid of the perennial scourges of poverty, ignorance and disease.

 He said the Centre and the states would work together to rejuvenate the agriculture credit system, provide relief to farmers and improve the quality of extension services.

 They would also address the specific needs and problems of drylands and wastelands, besides working to invest more in irrigation, the Prime Minister said.

 Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia had made a brief presentation at the meeting on the state of the economy and the challenges facing policymakers in the remaining years of the Tenth Plan.

 He said although the fundamentals of the economy were in good shape and perceptions about India had improved internationally, there were several areas of weakness, which needed corrective action.

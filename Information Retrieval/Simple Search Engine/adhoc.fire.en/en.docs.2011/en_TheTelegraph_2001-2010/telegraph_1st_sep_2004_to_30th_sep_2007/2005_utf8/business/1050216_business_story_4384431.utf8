 LIC eager to bet on stocks

 Bhardwaj: No risk, no gain

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: With the stock markets entering a bull phase, the country?s largest domestic investor in equities ?Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) ? is mulling the option of shovelling more funds into the bourses. 

 ?Our current exposure to the equity market is around 8 per cent. Since the size of the investible fund is increasing, we can very comfortably go up to 10 per cent depending on the availability of opportunities in the market,? LIC chairman R. N. Bhardwaj said today on the sidelines of an insurance conference organised here by Ficci.

 At present, LIC has an investible fund worth over Rs 3,70,000 crore of which Rs 31,000 crore is parked in corporate equities and over 50 per cent in central and state government papers.

 Under the investment guidelines, the corporation must invest at least 50 per cent of assets in central government bonds, 15 per cent in infrastructure and the social sector and a maximum of 35 per cent in the corporate sector, which includes bonds, stocks and project finance.

 Asked if LIC would be an active investor in the forthcoming public offers, Bhardwaj said, ?We will invest in all good issues that come to the market.?

 Eyeing 35 per cent growth in its overall business this year, LIC has already garnered Rs 10,000 crore in first premium income and hopes to close the year with over Rs 14,000 crore.

 In an effort to increase its market share, the insurer is planning to launch three new products, including a new Bima Nivesh plan, a unit-linked pension plan and a flexi-life endowment policy.

 Corporation Bank

 LIC today said it would not raise its stake in Mangalore-based Corporation Bank from the current level of 26.93 per cent.

 ?There is no proposal to raise the equity in Corporation Bank at the moment. We, along with the government, hold the maximum limit of 26 per cent,? Bhardwaj said.

 While the LIC Act allows the insurer to invest up to 30 per cent in the equity of a company, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority stipulates that insurance companies can invest only up to 20 per cent.

 Watanabe likely to drive Toyota 

 Nagoya, Feb. 8 (Agencies): Toyota Motor Corp plans to promote executive vice-president Katsuaki Watanabe to the presidency to replace Fujio Cho, sources in the company said today.

 Japan?s biggest automaker is expected to announce the appointment as early as Wednesday and make a formal decision at a board meeting in June following an annual shareholders? meeting, sources said.

 Toyota chairman Hiroshi Okuda, 72, has expressed his intention to complete his second two-year term as Japan business federation chairman through May 2006, raising speculation that the automaker will keep the Okuda-Cho management team intact during the period.

 But Toyota has decided to appoint Watanabe, 62, as new president in a bid to rejuvenate the management team, sources said.

 At the end of June, Cho will have been serving as Toyota?s president for six years.

 Cho, 68, is also expected to soon become vice-chairman of the federation, which is better known as Nippon Keidanren.

 Toyota apparently thought it difficult for both Okuda and Cho to serve as Nippon Keidanren leaders while remaining in the top company posts.

 Watanabe has been Toyota?s vice-president in charge of procurement and housing business since June 2001 after assuming the posts of managing director and senior managing director.

 Senior managing director Akio Toyoda, 48, the eldest son of founder and honorary chairman Shoichiro Toyoda, 79, is expected to become a vice-president, sources said.

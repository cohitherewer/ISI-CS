 Gecis is targeting a 25 per cent increase in revenues for 2005. Currently, Gecis has 17,000 professionals on its rolls, out of that about 1000 will be retained by the parent company, GE.

 It has outlined ambitious growth plans in Europe, Asia, and the Americas as it begins to accept contracts from multinationals beyond GE. Several new external contracts signed in the fourth quarter are contributing to increased hiring in several locations, including Calcutta, where Gecis has just opened a strategic new office location.

We have recently won a few landmark deals in the wake of global competition and are extremely well poised to grow in this segment.

 Baffin inks deal with Siemens

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 23: Baffin Engineering Projects Ltd has entered into an agreement with German telecom and engineering conglomerate, Siemens AG, for supply of wireless modules that allow GSM telephony majors to provide fixed wireless services. This will open up a new segment of business for mobile companies like Bharti TeleServices and Hutch Essar. 

 The vendor agreement with Uniword Telecom Ltd, a subsidiary of Baffin, will enable Siemens to supply wireless modules for GSM desktop phones, electronic point-of-sales terminals and gateways that connect wireless networks.

 Baffin managing director Ashok Motha said, ?There?s a virtually untapped market in the fixed telephony segment which has a subscriber strength of over 4 crore.?

 Baffin is also restructuring its capital as it readies itself to service the new business area. The Baffin board will consider issuing a 10 per cent stake to Lagos-based Reliance Telecommunications (RelTel) on a preferential allotment basis.

 The Lagos-based company has no connection with Mukesh Ambani?s Reliance Infocomm, Motha clarified. The company in Nigeria has a subscriber base of 1 lakh customers and has business interests in Nigeria with the same name for more than a decade, Motha added.

 RelTel managing director Sunil Pathak said, ?The equity participation will prove to be mutually beneficial.? While RelTel would look forward to a reliable telecom equipment vendor to cater to its growing needs, it will enable Baffin to enter Nigeria, which is one of the foremost telecom markets in Africa.?

 ?In the long term, we are looking at the entire African continent, comprising 40 countries, to give a boost to Uniword?s exports. Currently, exports comprise around 30 per cent of our revenue,? Motha added.

 In India, Baffin?s agreement with Siemens will enable GSM majors like Bharti and Hutch to compete in segments where it currently has little presence, Motha said.

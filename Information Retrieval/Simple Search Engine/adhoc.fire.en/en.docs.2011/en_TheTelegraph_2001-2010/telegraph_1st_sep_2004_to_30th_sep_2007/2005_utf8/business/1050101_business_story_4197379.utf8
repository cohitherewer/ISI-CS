 Brave new dawn for textile titans

 Mumbai, Dec. 31: It is that time of the year when everyone greets each other a Happy and Prosperous 2005. These wishes cannot be more apt for the domestic textile industry, which will enter a momentous phase with the three-decade old quota regime becoming history Friday midnight.

 With the removal of quantitative restrictions, it is projected that India?s share in the global textile and apparel market will double from the current 3 per cent by 2007. The government is optimistic and hopes that textile exports will zoom to $50 billion by 2010 from close to $11 billion now.

 But, where will India stand in the new scheme of things?

 Industry circles aver that the biggest beneficiary of the phasing out of the Multi Fibre Agreement (MFA) will be China followed by India. 

 ?China is going to swamp the market. India will also be a gainer, but not to the extent of China,? said M. P. Gajaria, adviser to Mumbai-based GTN group. 

 China?s share in the total clothing exports to the US is expected to jump to 50 per cent, up from the current 15 per cent. On the other hand, India?s share is likely to go up to 15 per cent from 4 per cent. 

 Known for its large scale of operations, China?s installed spindle capacity is 60 million compared with 37 million in India, added Gajaria.

 However, one does not need to feel disappointed. Experts point out that India will have its say in the global textile arena and the biggest gainers will be garments and home-textile exporters. 

 The impact is likely to be of a lesser extent in the case of fabrics or yarn, though these segments could be indirectly affected due to higher demand from Indian producers. 

 ?Garments and products such as home textiles are labour intensive items. We are already established in these segments. An importer from the US or the EU will not import fabric or yarn to manufacture garments,? said an analyst.

 Few exporters are also optimistic over the recent developments in the US, which has raised possibilities of that country imposing certain safeguards on Chinese textile imports. 

 ?The US buyers could consequently prefer clothing tailored from India,? said an exporter, who expects some curbs to be placed on Chinese textile imports.

 With quotas gone from the beginning of 2005, how will the year pan out for textile exports and realisations?

 Experts said the immediate impact could be in a form of price reduction. ?We are likely to see a price drop of 5-15 per cent over the current prices,? said Raghav Gupta, associate director at KSA Technopak.

 Gupta, who expects a 15 per cent growth in textile exports, gives two reasons for this decline. While there will be more competition on account of an open field now, prices could dip with the removal of quotas. ?The quotas came at a cost. There was a premium. With the removal of quotas, this premium will go and consequently prices will come down,? he added.

 According to Gupta, the impact of the quota-free regime will begin from the second or third quarter of 2005. Others, however, feel that 2005 will be a turbulent year and the real difference will only be seen in 2006.

 Rahul Mehta of Creative Garments, which is one of the largest textile exporting houses in the country, feels that the boom in exports will be seen from 2005-06. Though positive about the impact of the quota free regime, he is cautious on the outlook for India as a country that continues to face bottlenecks in infrastructure.

 Mehta, who had begun preparing for a free quota regime since the past couple of years, has repositioned his firm by moving up the value chain into garments and home textiles.

 He added that the removal of quotas does not mean that buyers will be keen to source huge quantities from India. ?Buyers will wait and watch and they are not rushing to new vendors. If an overseas buyer finds a new vendor, he will try him out for a season or two.?

 Apart from infrastructure, experts averred that one of the factors that could limit India?s stride in the new regime is its lack of ability to fulfil large-scale orders. Though there are leading players, including Creative Garments, Raymond, Welspun and many others that can handle this, the fragmented nature of the Indian textile industry is a source of caution for many

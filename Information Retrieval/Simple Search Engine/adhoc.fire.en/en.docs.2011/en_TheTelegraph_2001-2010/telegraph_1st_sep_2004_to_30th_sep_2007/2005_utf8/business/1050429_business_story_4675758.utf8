 Infotech needs more funds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 28: India?s investment in information technology is low. The IT investment is only 3.5 per cent of the total capital. In addition to being under-invested, the existing IT capital in India is not widely dispersed.

 The National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) today submitted a report to the Planning Commission on ?Information Technology in the Economy of India? that highlights the role of IT as a major economic growth driver in 30 countries. 

 The report highlights that minimal dispersal of IT capital has resulted in lower direct capital contributions to gross domestic product (GDP) and insignificant labour contribution to GDP.

 The report has identified three major reasons for slow uptake of IT in India. 

 ?First, the economy of India is poor. Second, despite growing trade liberalisation, imported hardware and its components remain subject to high tariffs. These tariffs raise the cost of computers, thereby lowering business and household investment in IT. Third, the government?s procurement policy and procedures for investing in IT assets are neither competitive nor transparent,? says the report. Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said, ?The report shows that the economies that increased 10 per cent investment in IT capital witnessed growth of 3.6 per cent in GDP. While a 10 per cent increase in labour hours increases GDP only by 1.6 per cent; a 10 per cent increase in labour hours has no statistically significant impact on GDP.?

 ?As IT capital deepens in an economy, IT capital adds more to GDP and more importantly, labour becomes more productive,? he said.

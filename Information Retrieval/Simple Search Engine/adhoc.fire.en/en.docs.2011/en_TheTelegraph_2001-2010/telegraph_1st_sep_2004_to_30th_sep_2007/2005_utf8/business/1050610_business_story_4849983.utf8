 Govt reshuffles bank top brass

 New Delhi, June 9 (PTI): In a sweeping reshuffle at the top rungs of public sector banks, the government today appointed new chairmen for Canara Bank, Bank of India, Indian Overseas Bank, Indian Bank and Andhra Bank. 

 Indian Bank chairman M. B. N. Rao will take charge at Canara Bank, a slot that was lying vacant after its former chief, V. P. Shetty, moved to IDBI. Andhra Bank boss T. R. Narayanswamy will become the new chief of Indian Overseas Bank.

 Three executive directors are being promoted as chairmen. K. C. Chakraborty of PNB will become the new chairman of Indian Bank, while K. Ramakrishnan of Bank of Baroda (BoB) will assume the role of Andhra Bank helmsman. Bank of India (BoI) executive director K. Balachandran has been elevated to the post of chairman.

 The appointments committee of cabinet cleared the names of five new bank chairmen, official sources said. H. A. Daruwala, the present executive director of Oriental Bank of Commerce, is tipped to become the chairman of Central Bank of India after its present CMD, Dalbir Singh, retires next month. The government has decided to promote nine of the best-performing general managers to the post of executive directors.

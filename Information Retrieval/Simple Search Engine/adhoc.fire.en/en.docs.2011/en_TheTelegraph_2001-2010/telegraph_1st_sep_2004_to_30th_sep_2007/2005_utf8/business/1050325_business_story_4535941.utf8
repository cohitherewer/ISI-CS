 Fixed wireless, within four walls

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 24: The department of telecommunications (DoT) today directed the operators offering fixed wireless phone service to limit this facility to the residence or office of the subscriber. Alternatively, they can treat this service as wireless in local loop (WiLL) mobile where charges have to be higher.

 In a letter to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, Reliance Infocomm and Tata Indicom, DoT has said the operators should ensure that the service is used by subscribers ?in accordance with the terms and conditions?.

 ?The terminal used for fixed wireless services should be strictly confined to the premises of the subscriber where the telephone connection is registered. It should also be noted that it is the licensee?s responsibility to ensure that the subscriber terminal is operated in accordance with the terms of the licence for fixed lines, including this clarification,? the letter added.

 A separate level within the allocated short distance charging area (SDCA) based link numbering has to be used for wireline and fixed wireless services.

 ?Wherever such restrictions cannot be imposed, it shall be treated as wireless in local loop mobile (WiLL-M) feature for all purposes, which inter-alia includes numbering plan, interconnection usage charges and interconnection arrangements,? the note said.

 Cellular operators had approached the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and DoT to restrain these three operators from offering mobile facilities on fixed wireless phones.

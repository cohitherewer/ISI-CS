 CERC charts open-access tariff policy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Basu: Upbeat

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has streamlined the procedure and pricing scheme for those seeking power under open access in the inter-state transmission system. 

 Transmission access is an important mechanism for opening up the electricity sector in the interest of the consumer.

 The new pricing scheme for inter-regional links is aimed to significantly reduce the financial burden of the state electricity boards (SEBs), which have the obligation to reimburse full transmission charges to Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd. 

 However, they were not getting adequate relief, even when others were using the inter-regional links to the extent of 100 per cent.

 CERC chairman A. K. Basu said, ?The new pricing scheme will be more conducive to future investment in the inter-regional links. The changes will directly benefit the end consumer.?

 Open access in transmission was introduced by the CERC for the first time in February 2004 in line with the Electricity Act, 2003.

 CERC has amended the regulation and has differentiated transmission customers in two categories ? long-term and short-term. The amended regulations shall be effective from April 1, 2005.

 A long-term customer is one who has or intends to enter into long-term bulk power agreement with a service provider for use of inter-state transmission system. The customer will have an exit option to relinquish or transfer transmission right and obligations with a prior approval of the commission, subject to payment of compensation as may be determined by CERC. 

 The short-term customer is ?anyone who is not a long-term customer? and will be allowed to draw power subject to availability of transmission capacity. 

 Allotment of transmission network will be on priority. The long-term customers will get priority over short-term ones. The wheeling of power for short-term customers shall be the first to be curtailed in the event of transmission constraint.

 The nodal agency for arranging long-term access will be the central transmission utility (PowerGrid), if its system is used. Otherwise the nodal agency will be the transmission service provider in whose system the drawl point is located. 

 The nodal agency for short term access shall be the regional load dispatch centre (RLDC) of the region, where the drawl point of electricity is situated.

 Tata Tele likely to take Reliance to tribunal

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Gearing up

 Calcutta, April 24: Tata Teleservices Limited is likely to move the Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) to sort out interconnect issues with Reliance Infocomm if talks are unsuccessful.

 Subscribers of the mobile and fixed-line services of Tata Teleservices have been unable to make or receive calls from Reliance users in all the 12 circles where the operator has recently launched operations. 

 Confirming that subscribers were unable to connect with Reliance phones, Rajesh Puri, chief operating officer (eastern hub) of Tata Teleservices, said, ?We have been routing calls made to Reliance phones through BSNL in all the new circles, except Bihar and Jharkhand, where the PSU telecom major has a capacity problem. This has resulted in an extra carriage cost of 0.15 paise per unit. This is in addition to the 0.30 paise termination charges paid to Reliance. However, our subscribers cannot receive calls made from Reliance phones.?

 Regarding an appeal to the TDSAT, Puri said, ?The matter was being discussed at the highest level. Reliance has said internal issues are hampering the decision. We will not move TDSAT till Reliance refuses to interconnect.?

 ?Various commercial and technical discussions with regard to matters of interconnection are underway between the two organisations and we look forward to a closure,? said a Reliance Infocomm spokesperson.

 Tata Teleservices has over 4 million subscribers in the 20 circles where it operates, of which 85,000 are in Calcutta.

 Puri said subscribers in the city were agitated and 50-60 per cent of the calls made to the customer care centres were regarding connectivity with Reliance phones.

 BSNL sources said while routing calls through another operator was not a problem, Reliance was violating interconnect agreements by blocking calls of Tata Teleservices.

 According to clause 27.5 of the cellular services licence agreement, it is mandatory for cellular mobile service providers to provide interconnection to all other telecom service providers. 

 Selective blocking of calls by any operator is a violation of the licence agreement.

 In January, the company had faced problems on the interconnect issue with cellular operators, who led by Bharti, had refused to sign interconnection agreements.

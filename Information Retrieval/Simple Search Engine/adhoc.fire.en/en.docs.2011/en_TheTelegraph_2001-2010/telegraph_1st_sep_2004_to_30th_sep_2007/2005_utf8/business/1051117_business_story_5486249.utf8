 FM sets Friday date with bank chiefs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: Finance minister P. Chidambaram has convened a meeting of the chairmen of public sector banks on Friday to discuss ways and means of increasing their capital base.

 The finance minister has already indicated that public sector banks would have to raise additional capital to the tune of Rs 60,000 crore over the next five years to meet the new adequacy norms under the Basel II stipulations and anticipated rise in credit requirements following high economic growth. 

 Indian banks would have to raise significant amount of capital after the new norms come into effect from March 31, 2007. The new capital adequacy norms are more risk sensitive and require banks to hold capital not only for credit and market risks but also for operational risks. Moreover, they are required to hold capital for concentration risks and liquidity risks as well.

 Efforts are already underway to allow domestic banks to float preference shares and hybrid debt instruments so that they can raise the required capital through their preferred route. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to soon come out with detailed guidelines on these.

 The meeting with the finance minister is also expected to take up several ticklish issues including a possible consolidation exercise within the government-owned banking system, banking sources said. The issue of consolidation is bound to come up. Most of the state-run banks will have to look for inorganic growth through acquisitions and mergers, if they have to reap the benefits of scale, a top executive of a public sector bank said.

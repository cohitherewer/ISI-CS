 Sebi to let big boys go short

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 NOT A LONG WAY OFF

 Mumbai, Dec. 29: The capital market regulator today set in motion its plans to permit institutional investors to short sell securities on the bourses. Retail investors can already do so and Sebi now wants to extend the facility to foreign institutional investors (FIIs), mutual funds, insurance companies and banks.

 Sebi has floated a discussion paper on the subject that sets several restrictions on short sales by the institutions. Short sales mean selling securities that the seller does not possess at the time of trade. If restrictions are not placed, indiscriminate short selling could drive stocks into the ground.

 As a first step, Sebi has indicated that it will not allow naked short sales. In a typical short sale, the investor sells shares he doesnt possess but he makes arrangements to borrow the securities from the market to square up his positions at the end of the two-day settlement. In a naked short sale, the investor has no intention of borrowing the shares and, therefore, fails to deliver the shares to the buyer. 

 In its paper, Sebis secondary markets advisory committee (SMAC) said short selling could be initially permitted only in those stocks where derivative products are available.

 The committee said all investors should mandatorily honour the obligation of delivering the shares at the time of settlement. Institutional investors have also been disallowed from day-trading.

 Institutional investors have been told to disclose upfront at the time of placement of the order whether the transaction is a short sale. The committee here said the institution should demonstrate their ability to borrow to the satisfaction of the broker, though it was silent on how this could be done. 

 The committee has put the onus on the stock exchanges to closely monitor settlement shortages and impose stiff penalties to deter naked short sales. Though the committee has not suggested the penalty that should be levied, it recommended that stock exchanges should frame a uniform penalty structure and take appropriate action against brokers for failure to deliver securities at the time of the settlement.

 As short selling may not work effectively in the absence of a vibrant market for securities lending and borrowing, the committee recommended that a full-fledged securities lending and borrowing scheme be put in place to provide the necessary impetus to short selling.

 Indiabulls goes on a rampage

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 10: Indiabulls Financial Services Limited surprised everybody by reporting a 578 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 59.93 crore for the three-month period ended September 30, 2005 as against Rs 8.84 crore in the corresponding period of last year.

 The company which began its journey as an internet brokerage has branched out into sectors such as real estate and personal loans, activities normally associated with a non-banking finance company.

 The strong performance of Indiabulls in the second quarter of the current financial year has once again demonstrated its strong execution ability and the large market opportunity. 

 The network of Indiabulls now extends beyond 250 branch offices and the total workforce exceeds 5900 employees across different businesses.

 Indiabulls has 1.5 lakh clients operating from 130 locations spread across the country and 10,000 clients who trade independently through the internet.

 We are hopeful of achieving good progress, said Sameer Gehlaut, chairman of Indiabulls Financial Services Ltd.

 The company promoted by a young group of IIM graduates is in the eye of the storm after Sebi, the market regulator, discovered a few Indiabulls clients rigging the share prices of two penny stocks. The company, however, denied any involvement in the affair.

 The total revenue earned by Indiabulls for the second quarter is Rs 155.03 crore and Rs 253.66 crore for the first half of the current fiscal. The revenues for the second quarter of the last year was Rs 28.40 crore. 

 The company has, however, not provided the segmental results separately.

 Profit before tax of Rs 89.16 crore for the quarter under review is 531 per cent higher than the same quarter of the previous year. The half year PBT at Rs 152.71 crore is 564 per cent more than the corresponding last years figure of Rs 22.99 crore. 

 The Indiabulls scrip rocketed today to touch an intra-day high of Rs 209 before ending the day at Rs 187.70, a gain of 2 per cent from Fridays close of Rs 183.95. Profit booking in the counter took a toll on the gains, dealers said. The current quarter was eventful as the company listed 2.76 crore global depository receipts (GDRs) on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

 The issue was lead managed by Citigroup and Merrill Lynch International. 

 Consequent to the GDR issue, the consolidated net worth of the group has increased to over Rs 1,300 crore and the paid-up share capital of the company has increased to Rs 32.41 crore.

 Yes Bank profit

 Yes Bank has recorded a net profit of Rs 14.25 crore in the second quarter of this fiscal compared with Rs 1.74 crore loss in the corresponding quarter last year. The total income of the bank grew eleven-fold to Rs 41.87 crore during the July-September quarter from Rs 3.71 crore during the same quarter in 2004-05.

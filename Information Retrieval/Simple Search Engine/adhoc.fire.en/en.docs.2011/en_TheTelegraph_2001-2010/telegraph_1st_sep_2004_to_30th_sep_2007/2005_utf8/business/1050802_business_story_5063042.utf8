 Entergy posts higher Q2 revenue

 New York, Aug. 1 (Reuters): Entergy Corp, the No. 2 US nuclear power company, on Monday said second-quarter earnings rose 8 per cent on revenue growth in its utility unit.

 Net income rose to $286.2 million, or $1.33 a share, from $265.2 million, or $1.14 a share, last year.

 Analysts have forecast an earnings of $1.32 a share. 

 Entergy said megawatt-hour sales in the residential sector, adjusting for weather, were up slightly, while commercial and governmental sales rose 1 per cent and industrial sales also grew by 1 per cent.

 Earnings fell at Entergy Nuclear, though, on planned and unplanned outages as well as employee benefit expenses.

 For the year, the company affirmed a forecast for earnings per share at the low end of a range of $4.60 to $4.85. Analysts had expected earnings per share of $4.65 for the year.

 Maran vows to clear rural phone backlog 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 4: The Union minister of communications and information technology, Dayanidhi Maran, today promised to provide telephones to more than 1.3 million waitlisted applicants in rural areas in the next 12 months.

 Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), the public sector telecom company, will be directed to enhance capacity to meet this target.

 Maran called for a focused approach to increase the teledensity in rural areas. He also highlighted that the teledensity in urban areas is 25 per cent against 1.1 per cent in villages.

 Addressing a parliamentary consultative committee on communications, Maran said, ?This gap shows a concerted approach needs to be adopted to increase the teledensity in rural areas.? The meeting was called to discuss the progress and the efforts needed to improve telecommunication in rural areas. The minister said there were 1.2 crore rural telephone connections.

 He informed the members of the committee that of 6 lakh villages in the country, most have been provided with village public telephones (VPT). However, 21,000 villages, which are affected by insurgency and those with population less than 100, have been excluded. 

 The remaining villages would be covered by VPTs in a phased manner by November 2007. Maran said the Universal Service Obligations (USO) Fund Administration has already awarded contracts to different telecom operators through tenders. The fund provides support for operational and maintenance cost of VPTs. He said, ?Most of the telecommunication facilities in rural areas are set up by BSNL. So far, private operators were not ready to enter rural areas. But now they have come forward and started bidding under the USO Fund.? 

 The minister said multi-access radio relay (MARR) VPTs are being replaced, most of which were non-functional. Of 2 lakh such VPTs, about 1,15,000 have already been replaced with the reliable technology.

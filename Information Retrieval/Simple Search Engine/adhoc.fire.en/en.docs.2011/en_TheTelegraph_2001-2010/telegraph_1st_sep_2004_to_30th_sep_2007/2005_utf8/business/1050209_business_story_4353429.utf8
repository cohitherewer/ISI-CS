The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Obsolete services need not be taxed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 8: The service sector has remained buoyant even though service tax has jumped twofold to 10 per cent in September 2004 from 5 per cent in March, according to a survey by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 Ficci wants service tax to be removed on services that have now become obsolete like telegraph, telex and pager services. 

 The study, which was released today at the national executive committee meeting of Ficci, confirms that the services sector continues to remain a predominant segment of GDP (gross domestic product). The sector today accounts for 52.4 per cent of the economy compared with industry (27.1 per cent) and agriculture (20.5 per cent). The sector contributes 66.5 per cent to the overall GDP growth.

 The survey, based on feedback from 25 service sector public and private firms and experts of over a dozen service sector related organisations reveals that the growth and development of the economy has spawned 63 new and emerging segments in the services sector.

 These segments are over and above the 73 service providers that have been brought under the tax net since 1994.

 The 63 viable segments come under the categories of trade and transportation, IT, communications and entertainment, financial sector, construction and real estate, education, health and social sectors, legal services, ports and shipping and environmental and other miscellaneous services.

 The study suggests that the government should evaluate these segments for augmenting resources for the national exchequer while carefully nurturing their growth through incentives and adequate credit facilities.

 The survey says there are certain services that have now become obsolete, even redundant, and a view needs to be taken on the continuation of tax on such services. It also says there is a need for clarification in some categories like auxiliary services in the financial sector.

 The survey notes that high rate of growth recorded by various segments of the sector has been due to its vast spread covering both formal and informal sectors and liberal policy measures and reforms undertaken by the government.

 Trade, hotels, transport and communication have led the momentum of service sector growth. There has been a strong growth in cargo handled in major ports.

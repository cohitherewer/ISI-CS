 Rupee slides on fresh dollar demand

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 2: The rupees slide continued for the third day with the currency hitting a 15-month closing low of 46.19 against the dollar on the interbank forex markets here today. 

 The drop was triggered by the greenbacks rise against other currencies, particularly the Yen, and the absence of a strong intervention by the RBI.

 The Indian currency had opened weaker by 10 paise at 46.11. The pressure further intensified as the dollar appreciated to a 32-month high against the Yen. 

 Amid heavy dollar demands from companies and importers, the rupee tumbled to the days low of 46.23 in late afternoon deals.

 Dealers said though some state-run banks had sold dollars at 46.15 presumably at the behest of the central bank, the intervention was not strong enough to reverse the slide. 

 Moreover, there was some activity in the non-deliverable forward market, which acted against the Indian unit.

 The rupee, however, settled at 46.19 per dollar, within a striking distance of 46.27 logged at the close of trade on September 10 last year. 

 It had ended at a 14-month closing low of 46.01 on Thursday. The currency has depreciated by over 38 paise this week, although FIIs have been net investors in the equity markets.

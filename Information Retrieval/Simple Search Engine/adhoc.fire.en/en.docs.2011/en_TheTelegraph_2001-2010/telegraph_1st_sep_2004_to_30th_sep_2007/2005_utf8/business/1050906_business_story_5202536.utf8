 EU wants India to sign unified aviation pact

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Destination unlimited

 New Delhi, Sept. 5: The European Union wants India to sign a single horizontal pact with Europe instead of the numerous bilateral air services agreements it has with the UK, Germany, Netherlands and other western European nations.

 The move could prove revolutionary for the aviation market between India and Europe. The number of flights, destinations and airlines operating between the destinations would all increase. 

 The European Union wants to remove nationality restrictions in bilateral agreements between its member-states and India. This way, Indian carriers will get to treat Europe as a single nation for aviation pacts.

 The EU is targeting India as it is seen as one of the most outstanding markets in international aviation with a projected annual growth rate of 20 per cent .

 But the move has its risks, too. Domestic carriers will fly to many more cities, but India will also would face increased competition from European carriers unbound by earlier restrictions.

 The European Union says the nationality restrictions have been found incompatible with European law by the European Court of Justice. With 16 initialled horizontal agreements, the EU claims it has brought more than 260 bilateral air services agreements in line with European law. Chile and Australia were among the first countries to comply.

 EU sources said they have already received a mandate for the creation of a transatlantic open aviation area with the United States. It has also sought negotiations with Russia and China. EU has also started negotiating an agreement on a European common aviation area with the western Balkan countries.

 The EU pact proposal comes at a time when its president ? British Prime Minister Tony Blair ? comes to Delhi to formalise an Indo-UK air services agreement. The pact allows 56 more flights out of Delhi and Mumbai to Heathrow a week. The pact will also allow unlimited flights from other Indian cities to destinations in the UK other than Heathrow. It also allows doubling of flights from 40 to 84 a week out of the UK.

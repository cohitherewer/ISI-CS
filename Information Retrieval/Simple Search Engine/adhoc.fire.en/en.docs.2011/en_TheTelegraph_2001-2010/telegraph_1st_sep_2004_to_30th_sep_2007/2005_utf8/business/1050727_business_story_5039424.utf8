 Toyota drives against tide

 Tokyo, July 26: At a time 

 when Detroits Big Three automakers are offering steeply 

 reduced employee discounts to nearly everyone 

 who walks in the door, Toyota Motor is doing the opposite: 

 earlier this month, it announced slight price increases 

 on many models sold in the US. 

 Toyota, Japans largest carmaker, 

 says the increases, which will affect American versions 

 of its popular Camry sedan and some cars in its luxury Lexus 

 lineup, are necessary because of the rising costs of steel 

 and other raw materials. 

 But the move also reflects the 

 determination of Toyota and other major Japanese car companies 

 to avoid competing on price, even as their Big Three rivals 

 use an unprecedented bout of sticker slashing to draw buyers 

 into showrooms filled with cars. 

 In the US, the worlds largest 

 car market, Japanese automakers have long chosen to shun 

 cash and other sales incentives in favour of building a 

 loyal customer base and then taking their sizeable profits 

 and plowing them back into higher quality and costly technologies 

 like low-pollution engines. Its a good strategy, 

 said Kunihiko Shiohara, an auto analyst at Goldman Sachs. 

 Japanese can increase price because demand remains 

 strong. US customers have so far been loyal.

 The Japanese carmakers have also 

 tried to avoid large rebates and other costly incentives 

 for fear of undermining perhaps their biggest sales point 

 among American consumers: the high prices many Japanese 

 cars command on the resale market.

 We have no plans to offer 

 new incentives or price cuts, said Koichi Kondo, senior 

 managing director in charge of Honda Motors American 

 operations. Cutting prices might boost short-term 

 sales, but in the long run, it hurts the cars residual 

 value.

 But this summers bitter 

 price war among American firms is putting the Japanese strategy 

 to its toughest test. 

 By offering regular buyers the 

 same fat discounts once reserved for company insiders, General 

 Motors scored its best month in 19 years, with sales soaring 

 46.9 per cent by volume in June from a year earlier, according 

 to the Autodata Corp, which tracks sales figures. Ford Motor 

 and DaimlerChryslers Chrysler Group followed this 

 month with similar offers, kindling hopes that a surge in 

 summer sales would lift Detroits flagging fortunes.

 General Motors offer did 

 so well that it helped American carmakers take back some 

 of the domestic market share they lost in recent years to 

 the Japanese.

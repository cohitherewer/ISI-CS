 Myth vs reality: Guessing game on small investor pool

 SATISH JOHN

 Where do you go?

 Mumbai, June 13: Sample this: In a country of over one billion, the number of people putting money in stocks is actually less than 1 per cent of the total population. Investment in the stock market is the luxury of a miniscule few in the country, though some reports put the figure at two crore. 

 Where are the investors, lamented C. B. Bhave, managing director of National Securities Depository Limited. 

 He should know as his depository has 64 lakh demat accounts. Demat accounts keep shares in a paperless form just as money is stored in a savings account. 

 CDSL, the other depository spawned by BSE, has over 10 lakh demat accounts.

 If there are two crore equity investors, where are they, Bhave asks. It is now easier to track the number of investors as anyone who wants to trade on the bourses has to open a demat account. Physical settlement of shares is no longer permitted.

 There are many investors who are wedded to their shares and who seldom buy stocks from the secondary market, says Shitin Desai, executive vice-chairman of DSP Merrill Lynch, an upper-crust investment banking outfit. 

 Such investors rarely have a demat account, he explained. 

 Many investors also prefer to apply for shares through initial public offers but rarely trade in stocks. 

 Somewhere our assumptions need to be questioned, Bhave said. There are some who still hold shares from their grandfathers days, he added.

 Stock markets are considered the true barometer of investor sentiments in the country and such a small number of shareholders when compared with investments in small savings instruments throws up a big question.

 Is the equity cult alive in India? How seriously should one take the movements in the stock markets?

 According to Desai, the mutual funds have entered small towns and are successfully totting numbers. While many Indian investors are known to hoard their shares, he believes small investors in India would add up to just 1.5 crore.

 Interestingly, during the upswing in the market, it was the small investor who was selling steadily. This got revealed in the share ownership pattern of leading companies in recent times.

 A study by an FII brokerage revealed that small shareholders of Indias top 50 companies have sold almost 6 per cent of their holdings in 2002 and 2003. They did this both directly and through their mutual fund holdings. 

 As a result, their ownership in these companies are down to 18 per cent, excluding the stake held by Indian mutual funds. What small investors sold must have been lapped up by foreign buyers who were keen to invest in India.

 Foreign stake in the top-10 Indian companies rose sharply by 7.3 per cent to 35.2 per cent, say experts. The stakes do not even include the strategic holdings of foreign partners in companies like ICICI Bank and HDFC Ltd.

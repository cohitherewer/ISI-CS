 Calcutta, July 20: Britannia Industries Limited plans to diversify its operations within the food sector.

 We are weighing options and are looking at both organic and inorganic growth within the sector, chairman Nusli Wadia said on the sidelines of the companys annual general meeting here today.

 The company is the largest player in the branded and organised biscuit industry with a market share of 38 per cent.

 The company is also looking at overseas markets for consolidation and expansion. 

 We plan to establish our presence in other countries. Our expansion plans include foreign acquisitions too. However, the board will take a final decision on this, said Wadia. The company currently exports to West Asia and a few other countries.

 The shareholders approved the appointment of Vinita Bali as chief executive officer and manager of the company in place of Nikhil Sen. 

 After the exit of Sunil Alagh, Britannia had not appointed a managing director. The designation does not make any difference and all the executive powers has been vested with the present chief executive officer and manager, Wadia said.

 The company had stopped production at its Mumbai facility, which was taken on lease from the Mumbai Port Authority. Several other companies has similar facilities on land leased from the authority. However, the latter has filed various cases against the lessees, the decisions on which are pending in the Supreme Court. Though we plan to develop the Mumbai facility, it would depend on the court decision, said Wadia.

 The decision to develop the Mumbai facility also depends on the completion of voluntary retirement and terminal compensation benefits provided by the company, he added.

 Party donations

 Britannia Industries has donated a sum of Rs 80 lakh to the Bhartiya Janata Party and Rs 45 lakh to the Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee.

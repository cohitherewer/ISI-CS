 Adlabs shares soar on Ambani deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 1: The shares of Adlabs Films surged today as the bourses cheered Anil Ambanis move to acquire the film processing company.

 Heavy buying saw the share, which opened at Rs 253.10, soar to an intra-day high of Rs 286.90. However, it closed at Rs 280.50, registering a gain of Rs 39.90 or 16.58 per cent over yesterday. The scrip was the top-traded one on the BSE with 25.41 lakh shares being transacted. The total turnover stood at Rs 70.65 crore.

 Reliance Capital Ltd and RLPL (formerly Reliance Land Ltd), part of Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprises (ADAE), yesterday made public their plans to buy Adlabs Films for Rs 360 crore. Reliance Capital already owns over 5 per cent of Adlabs and will acquire a 23.2 per cent stake from its two founders at Rs 169 per share, totalling Rs 98.02 crore.

 Adlabs will also make a preferential allotment of 1.1 crore shares and 38 lakh warrants to Reliance Capital at Rs 175.20 each for Rs 259 crore. Reliance Capital will also make an open offer for 20 per cent of Adlabs at Rs 183 per share. 

 Reliance Capital will hold over 71 per cent of Adlabs if the preferential offer is fully subscribed, the warrants are converted and the open offer is successful.

 The open offer rate is, however, at a discount of 35 per cent to the closing price of the Adlabs scrip on the BSE today. This reflects the confidence of the market in the new development, brokers said.

 ADAE, which is looking at opportunities in the entertainment space, had recently acquired a stake in Prime Focus, a Rs 30-crore company promoted by Bollywood producer Naresh Malhotra. 

 RLPL is promoted and controlled by Reliance Capital. The issued and paid-up equity capital of RLPL consists of 1 crore shares. For the year ended March 31, the company has recorded a total income of Rs 0.78 lakh.

 Adlabs plans to set up film processing laboratories in Hyderabad, Bangalore and Calcutta to hedge against growing competition. In April, the company made a preferential issue to BSMA Ltd.

 Taxation bill clears Lok Sabha hurdle

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 14: The Lok Sabha today passed the Taxation Laws (Second Amendment) Bill, 2005 amidst protests by the Opposition on a provision to impose an income tax with retrospective effect on exporters earning more than Rs 10 crore.

 The exemption limit of Rs 10 crore is based on a thorough study by legal and economic departments and is based on recommendations of the economic advisory council, finance minister P. Chidambaram said. 

 Dissatisfied with the ministers explanation to levy tax on any profit on transfer of the duty entitlement passbook scheme (DEPB), the Opposition staged a walk out demanding that the provision be scrapped altogether.

 The BJP members sought enhancing of the exemption limit saying it would help additional number of exporters.

 The Lok Sabha, later, passed the bill on a voice-vote.

 I have to protect the interest of small exporters as well as the revenue. I think we have struck a balance, he said adding he had to consider the revenue aspect keeping in mind the social sectors programmes, like Sarva Siksha Abhiyan and mid-day meal scheme.

 The economic advisory committee, headed by R. Rangarajan, submitted its report to the Prime Minister and the proposal, which was in line with its recommendations, was accepted by the government, Chidambaram said.

 The bill aims at extending tax incentives to export business with effect from assessment year 1998-1999 under the DEPB and the DFRC schemes.

 It includes amendments to exemption from income tax, any payment received in respect of a lease of an aircraft or aircraft engine by the government of a foreign state or enterprise. Airlines, particularly Indian Airlines and Air-India, have asked for continuation of the levy as their leasing programme is not over. We are vulnerable to persuasion, the minister said adding the exemption has been extended from September to March, 2006.

 The legislation also includes levies to specified income of persons notified by the Centre participating in any international sporting event conducted in India and exempting any income of subsidiary company engaged in generation, transmission or distribution of power.

 Chidambaram said this was necessary to give a legal basis to the Dabhol Power project, now renamed Ratnagiri Gas and Power Ltd.

 The wide-ranging legislation also exempts political parties registered under section 29a of the Representation of The People Act, 1951 and other such acts from paying fringe benefit tax and exempts inter-bank exemption from banking cash transaction tax.

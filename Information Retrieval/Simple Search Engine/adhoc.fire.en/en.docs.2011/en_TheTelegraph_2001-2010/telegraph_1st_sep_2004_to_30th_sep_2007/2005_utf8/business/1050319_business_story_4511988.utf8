 Pressure on West to slash farm subsidies

 New Delhi, March 18: The Group of 20 (G-20) developing countries today said the developed West should slash domestic support and phase out export subsidies to the farm sector in five years.

 The draft ministerial statement being discussed at the two-day meeting seeks substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support by the European Union nations and the US.

 It proposes to initiate negotiations, which will determine the base periods and the initial and final numbers for the overall domestic support that distorts trade. 

 The meet is expected to announce tomorrow a proposal on the amount of subsidy cut required and the dates by which this should be achieved. The paper would state the position of the G-20 nations, which includes India, China, Brazil and South Africa, in the final run-up to the WTO ministerial to be held in Hong Kong in December.

 The G-20 nations are against any attempt to reduce the minimum farm support given by developing nations.

 On market access, the G-20 members said the critical ?gateway? issue for developing countries was conversion of specific duties to ad valorem equivalents to ensure greater transparency.

 They expressed fears over circumvention of market access commitments by developed countries through ?inappropriate conversion methodology?.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath said a tariff reduction formula should take into account the developing world?s concerns over food security, livelihood and rural development, which were recognised in the framework for negotiations agreed by the WTO members last July.

 The G-20 nations are in favour of progressive tariff reduction. This will entail deeper cuts for higher bound tariffs and lesser impact on developing countries. It will also have the flexibility to take into account the sensitive nature of some products.

 Emphasising that the negotiating process take place in Geneva, the ministers said participation by all members in the phases of negotiations should be made mandatory. 

 ?This is an essential element for a legitimate outcome to these negotiations to the benefit of the whole membership,? they added.

 The ministers want the concerns of small and vulnerable economies and net food-importing developing countries to be effectively addressed. 

 India is hosting a ministerial conference of G-20 developing nations for the first time. 

 Around 120 delegates are attending the meeting. They are from China, Pakistan, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, China Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, Tanzania, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Nigeria and Thailand.

 Exports touch $70 billion

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 12: India?s exports touched the $70-billion-mark during the 11-month period till February, bringing the country closer to the $75-billion target fixed for the current fiscal. Exports in 2003-04 were estimated at $63.4 billion. For the month of February, exports were valued at $6.7 billion. 

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath said, ?More than exchange rate variations, the significant increase in exports during the current financial year has been on account of the growing competitiveness of the Indian manufacturing sector and the government?s vigorous export-led growth strategy.?

 Export-oriented units

 Indian exporters operating outside export-oriented units (EOUs) have asked for 100 per cent convertibility of their export earnings parked in EEFC accounts. Currently, exporters are entitled to credit 50 per cent of their export proceedings in export earners foreign currency EEFC account.

 Export houses which are classified as Export Oriented Units have already been permitted to credit 100 per cent of their export proceeds into EEFC accounts.

 In a representation submitted to the Reserve Bank of India, Mahendra K. Sanghi, president of Assocham said, EEFC accounts should be allowed to be used as collateral against borrowings and should be treated as interest earning deposits.

 Exporters also want local bills, like telephone and fax, to be settled from the balance available in the EEFC account.

 One of the interesting reasons why exporters want full convertibility is for the purpose of giving loans. The chamber said, ?Exporters holding EEFC account should also be allowed to give loans to friends in need, at mutually agreed rates of interests for a temporary period.?

 Sanghi suggested that the foreign reserves can also be used for progressive retirement of high-cost external debt.

 Fuel price hike certain, time amp; size uncertain

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 18: With the cost of the Indian basket of crude imports touching a record high of $51.64 a barrel, a rise in the price of petrol and diesel seems to be inevitable.

 However, the quantum of the price rise and its timing will be ruled by the political compulsions of the ruling coalition.

 The public sector oil firms are seeking a Rs 3.50 per litre hike in petrol prices and a Rs 2.80 per litre increase in diesel prices, according to a senior petroleum ministry official. 

 Since crude accounts for 90 per cent of the cost of petro products, the global rally of oil prices has hit the bottomlines of oil PSUs like Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum. Hence, these companies are seeking an increase in the price of petro products.

 Apart from this, oil companies want to pass on to consumers the 50 paise per litre cess on diesel and petrol, which was introduced in the budget for the National Highway Development Fund.

 Oil majors are also claiming an additional Rs 1.50 per litre increase in the auto-fuel prices to compensate for the extra investment they have incurred for producing cleaner Euro-III grade petrol and diesel for 11 major cities and the Euro-II grade for the rest of the country. 

 The cleaner fuels are slated to be introduced from April 1 and oil firms have invested over Rs 40,000 crore to upgrade their refineries for producing green fuels. 

 This would work out to a Rs 5.50 per litre hike in petrol prices and make diesel dearer by Rs 4.80 per litre.

 Political compulsions cannot permit such a sharp hike in the price of the two auto fuels. Oil companies would have to settle for a modest rise. Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar will discuss this issue with the cabinet.

 IOC expects to lose Rs 400 crore on selling petrol and diesel at current prices during March. While BPCL and HPCL could end up losing around Rs 200 crore each. 

 Oil companies also expect to lose Rs 400 crore on petrol and diesel sales this month due to changes in the tax structure introduced in the budget, although finance minister P. Chidambaram has claimed that the exercise was ?revenue-neutral?.

 While IOC expects to lose Rs 225 crore, HPCL and BPCL anticipate a loss of around Rs 90 crore each this month. It will add to the burden the oil firms are already facing due to the sale of LPG and kerosene at below the market price.

 Orissa talent pool for BPO firms

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Taking the call

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 9: The Orissa government wants to create a vast pool of trained manpower for BPO companies.

 With the BPO sector on an upswing, the Orissa Computer Application Centre (OCAC) has roped in two leading consultants to prepare a large talent pool for low-end jobs in the sector. At present, Orissa has a dearth of graduates with expertise in IT and proficiency in English.

 Orissa IT minister Suryo Patro said the state government will soon launch a world-class training programme in collaboration with the Bangalore-based companies like Mafoi and NEXT. The state has also tied up with MERIT TRAC for conducting skill assessment tests to facilitate recruitment by leading BPO companies planning to set up units in the state.

 ?The centre will provide infrastructure support for this training programme. Recruitment tests will be conducted next week in major towns across the state by major BPO companies,? OCAC chief executive and director of information and technology Vishal Dev said. 

 Initially, 50 students will be trained by OCAC and the Orissa State Electronic Development Centre (OSEDC) each at the proposed centres in Bhubaneswar.

 Progeon of Infosys, ICICI OneSource, EXL Services, Allianz Corn Hills and H-P have already expressed interest to recruit successful candidates. BPO companies of Dell, HSBC and 24X7 will visit the city to explore the possibilities of opening centres.

 The state government has initiated a number of incentives for IT and IT-enabled services industries. Infosys, Satyam and TCS have already set up their development centres here. 

 It has targeted a 40 per cent rise in IT exports from Orissa by March 2005 over the previous year?s Rs 319 crore. In the first seven months of this fiscal, the state had an export figure of Rs 254 crore. The government aims to reach the Rs 1,000-crore mark by 2007.

 An estimate by the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) says that 65,000 new BPO jobs in the country was created in the six months between January and June 2004. In the next six months, the sector will employ 225,000 people against 171,100 at present.

 The state government feels that setting up training facilities will curb the exodus of BPO job aspirants. By 2009, there will be a shortage of 5 lakh hands in the BPO sector alone. 

 ?Our target is to open employment avenues for more than 50,000 graduates every year, and help call centre career aspirants turning to cities like Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad for such training,? Patro said.

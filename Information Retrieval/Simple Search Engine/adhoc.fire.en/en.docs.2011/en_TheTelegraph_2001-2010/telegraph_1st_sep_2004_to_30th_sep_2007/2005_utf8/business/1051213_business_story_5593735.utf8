The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Logan to cost a shade over Rs 3 lakh 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 12: Renaults budget car Logan could cost around 6,000 euro or approximately Rs 3.30 lakh for Indian customers, said Jean Leviol, French head of the economic missions for India and South Asia, at an interactive session organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce.

 A joint venture company between the French auto firm and its Indian partner Mahindra and Mahindra (M amp;M) will produce the budget car, which is expected to roll out in 2007.

 M amp;M will hold a 51 per cent stake in the joint venture company, which has already invested about Rs 600 crore in a facility at Nasik that is equipped to produce around 50,000 Logans a year.

 M amp;M officials had earlier said the new car would be produced with 50 per cent local content.

 The car has been designed to be the cheapest C-segment car and was launched a year ago in eastern Europe and a few months back in western Europe to encouraging response.

 Meanwhile, France-based retail chain Carrefour has shown interest in opening its store in the city.

 Wal-Mart, the leading global retail company, was also keen on setting shop in the state. However, the giant could not get the states go-ahead to commence retail operations.

 Till date, only German company Metro Cash and Carry has been permitted to transact with business entities.

 The chief minister has asked us to wait and Carrefour has decided to enter the state as and when regulations will permit, said Leviol.

 Leviol said agri business was given the highest priority at the meeting held with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee last week.

 France is keen to explore business opportunities in Bengal across sectors, including retail and agro sectors, he added.

 We will try to identify sectors to attract investors and have already devised some strategies for the food sector. We are also keen to collaborate on power and mass transportation, said Leviol.

 France is a leading player in nuclear power, where 80 per cent of the electrical energy is met from the nuclear source.

 Several French companies like carmaker Renualt and budget hotel chain Accor are keen to expand their operations in India.

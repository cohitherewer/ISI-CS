 Mumbai, Nov. 17: Mahindra amp; Mahindra Ltd (M amp;M) today formed a 51:49 joint venture with International Truck amp; Engine Corporation of the US to make trucks and buses in India.

 M amp;M has Scorpio and Bolero in the utility vehicles segment and is a major player in the domestic agricultural tractor segment.

 International is a leading North American player in medium and heavy trucks and buses and the worlds largest manufacturer of medium-duty diesel engines.

 M amp;M chairman Keshub Mahindra signed the agreement with Daniel Ustian, chairman, president and CEO of Navistar International Corporation, the parent company of International. 

 The domestic commercial vehicle market is growing rapidly, keeping pace with ongoing infrastructure projects.

 ?This JV will help us strengthen our competencies in product development, engineering and manufacturing. Besides widening our participation in the domestic auto sector, our relationship with International Truck will also support our aspirations to be a global player, quot; M amp;M vice-chairman and managing director Anand Mahindra said.

 The new joint venture will be called Mahindra International. The project will involve an investment amount of $80 million (Rs 360 crore). The new range of medium and heavy commercial vehicles will be introduced in 2007.

 M amp;M has been aggressively forming partnerships with foreign auto companies to become a significant player at home. Early this year, it signed a joint venture with French car company Renault to manufacture Logan in India. Logan is a mid-size car, which will be rolled out on Indian roads by mid 2007.

 The company aims to be in every segment of the commercial vehicle market, including passenger transport, cargo and specialised load applications.

 The medium and heavy vehicle product range will be engineered to meet domestic requirements. The joint venture?s product range and technology will also focus on serving export markets in Asia, Africa, Russia and Central Europe as well as providing International Truck with appropriate low-cost products and aggregate technologies for the US.

 Internationals truck development and technology centre, USA, and M amp;M?s automotive product development group have been working on a product development programme for the past several months.

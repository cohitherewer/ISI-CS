 Purnendu lives on Haldia hope

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Purnendu: Hopeful

 Calcutta, July 31: Purnendu Chatterjee of The Chatterjee Group is hopeful that the Bengal government will give him a chance to acquire the 36.87 per cent stake in Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL), even though the deadline expired today.

 I am hopeful that the government will give me a chance. I am committed to HPL, Purnendu told The Telegraph.

 The government, on the other hand, is thinking of making a fresh valuation of HPL shares. There are rumours that not only IOC but overseas investors are also showing interest in the company. Sources say one of them are the Hindujas. 

 This has prompted the government to take a fresh look at the valuation of HPL shares.

 HPL is performing well and its fundamentals are strong. Many domestic as well as overseas companies have shown interest. We are yet to take a decision, Bengal commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said.

 He, however, denied having received any proposal from the Hindujas even though chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had said the group wanted to invest in the states petrochem industry.

 By August 18, the government will have to decide whether to let IOC acquire a 7.5 per cent stake in HPL against the payment of Rs 150 crore it has already made.

 We are trying to sort out the issue and hope that something will emerge before August 18, the last date for encashing the cheque, Sen said.

 Before issuing shares, the government has to go back to Purnendu, who has the first right of refusal. The NRI enterpreneur, who is not in favour of issuing shares to IOC, also questioned the governments decision to allot shares to IOC at the face value of Rs 10 while he was being asked to shell out a premium of Rs 20.

 On July 28, the Bengal government decided not to sell its shares to Purnendu ? three days before the July 31 deadline. Purnendu had 90 days time to bring in Rs 1,560 crore to buy the stake. However, TCG sources claim there was no official deadline.

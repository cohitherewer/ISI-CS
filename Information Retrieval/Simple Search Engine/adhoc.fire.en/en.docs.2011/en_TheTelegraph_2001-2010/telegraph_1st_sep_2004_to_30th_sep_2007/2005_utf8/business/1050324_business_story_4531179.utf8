The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Rich flavour in tea output

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, March 23: The tea industry has estimated the production in 2005-06 at 850 million kg against 820 million kg in 2004-05 ? a rise of almost 4 per cent.

 The orthodox tea production, one of the major foreign exchange earners of the industry, is expected to go up to 80 million kg from 65 million kg in 2004-05.

 Indian Tea Association chairman C. K. Dhanuka said, ?We expect international production to be down by 1 per cent in 2005-06 as the weather condition is not good in the tea producing nations, except India.? The country had reaped a lower crop in 2004-05 because of adverse weather conditions.

 Dhanuka said, ?In 2004-05, global tea production was 3,150 million kg, including India?s production of 820 million kg. If we exclude India, the total production was 2,300 million kgs. We expect this figure to reduce by 25-30 million kgs. The global supply position will have an influence on Indian tea prices.?

 The industry is expecting a 2 per cent growth in tea consumption from the months of May and June when quality tea will enter the market. India?s per capita tea consumption is 660 gms per annum, which is much lower than that of even Pakistan. This indicates that there is ample opportunity to increase India?s per capita tea consumption in the years to come.

 The conscious effort of the industry to increase orthodox production is aimed at increasing exports. 

 Most of the Wana countries like the UAE, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Egypt, where India is trying to get a foothold, want orthodox tea for consumption.

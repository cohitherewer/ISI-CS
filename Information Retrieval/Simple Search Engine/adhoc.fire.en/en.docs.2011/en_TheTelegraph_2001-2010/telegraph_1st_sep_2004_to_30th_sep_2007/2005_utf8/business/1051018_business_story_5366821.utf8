 Kalyani Brakes in pact with Italian company

 New Delhi, Oct. 17 (PTI): Bosch-subsidiary Kalyani Brakes today formed a 13 million euro (around Rs 70 crore) joint venture with Italian company Brembo for application engineering, production and sale of two-wheeler brakes.

 The two companies signed the agreement for the 50:50 joint venture company ? KBX Motorbike Products Pvt Ltd ? which will be headquartered at Pune.

 The agreement will see Kalyani Brakes integrate its existing two-wheeler brake production into the joint venture. On the other hand, Brembo will contribute licences and technology and will have the industrial leadership.

 For the first 12 months, Bosch forecast the turnover for the new company at around 20 million euros (about Rs 108 crore) which it said was expected to double over the next four years.

 Products are initially intended for the Indian market and the joint venture will explore export potential in the near future, the company said in a statement here.

 It said the deal was subject to the final approval of the relevant anti-trust authorities and the Foreign Investment Promotion Board in India.

 Bosch had recently increased its stake in Kalyani Brakes from 40 per cent to 80 per cent and took over the industrial leadership there.

 Kalyani Brakes manufacturers conventional brake systems and components and has plants at Jalgaon, Pune, and Manesar. The company generated sales of 63 million euros in the fiscal year 2004-05 and has approximately 1,800 associates.

 Brembo is the recognised leader in the design and manufacturing of high performance braking systems and components for a wide range of vehicles. It has been licensing some design for motorcycle braking systems, without brand, to Kalyani Brakes since 1999.

 The joint venture represents a significant development of Brembos presence into the far east market for two-wheeler brakes. The Indian market is growing fast... And the Pune plant will represent a base for the commercial expansion of Brembo products in the Asian region, the statement said.

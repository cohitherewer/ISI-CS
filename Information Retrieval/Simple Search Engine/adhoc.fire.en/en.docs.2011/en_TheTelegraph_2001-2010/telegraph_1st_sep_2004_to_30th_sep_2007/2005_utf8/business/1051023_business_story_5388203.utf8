 Indiabulls in new venture

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 22: Shrugging off the setbacks in National Textile Mills? land deal, Indiabulls Financial Services Ltd hugged San Francisco-headquartered Farallon Capital Management LLC more tightly by selling a majority stake to it in a new real estate venture, Indiabulls Real Estate Company Pvt Ltd.

 Indiabulls has informed stock exchanges that FIM Ltd, a company incorporated in Mauritius and managed by Farallon Capital Management, has bought 60 per cent equity in Indiabulls Real Estate Company Pvt Ltd for Rs 5.1 crore.

 Indiabulls and Farallon are the two partners in Indiabulls Properties, which had bid for the NTC Mills land in Mumbai. The company, however, received a setback after Mumbai High Court had scuppered the plan of National Textile Mills to sell its properties to pay workers and also get the remaining units back in action.

 The successful bids by Indiabulls were set aside by the court, which the online stock brokerage-cum-realtor said it would challenge in the Supreme Court.

 The newly formed Indiabulls Real Estate, a property investment vehicle of the two partners, will be used for buying properties in future, said Gagan Banga, a senior official in the company.

 But Indiabulls Real Estate will not have anything to do with the properties already acquired by Indiabulls Properties ? these include Elphinstone Mills and Jupiter Mills for Rs 441.8 crore and Rs 276 crore, respectively.

 Breathless and still racing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 12: The sensex breached the 8100-mark today, confounding analysts on Dalal Street. Relentless buying by foreign institutional investors fuelled the rally.

 The BSE bellwether index touched an intra-day peak of 8142.81 after it opened firm at 8072.99. Though the sensex fell below the 8100-mark during the day, it closed at a new high of 8138.42, a net gain of 78.41 points over the last close of 8060.01.

 Brokers said apart from the FII factor, good performance by regional bourses, including Tokyos Nikkei, helped the days rally. The Nikkei created records, boosted by Prime Minister J. Koizumis victory in Sundays elections.

 Todays close marks the ninth straight winning session for the sensex. The key index has gained 504 points or 6.6 per cent between August 30 and September 12. Last Thursday, it crossed a milestone when it ended above 8000.

 Since then, a few observers were expecting a correction because of expensive valuations. The equity markets have, however, defied their speculation amid buoyant inflows from FIIs, who have poured in close to $7.9 billion. The indices have also braved the surging crude oil prices, which at one point rose above the $70-per-barrel-mark.

 We may see yet another 100 to 200-point rally following which a correction may take place. Retail investors are advised not to take any fresh positions in such a market, said an analyst from a local brokerage. 

 On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) today, the AV Birla group shares were in focus after the management yesterday decided to merge Indo Gulf and Birla Global Finance with Indian Rayon to form a combined entity called Aditya Birla Nuvo.

 Among these three shares, while Indo Gulf and Birla Global Finance gained, the Indian Rayon scrip ended in the red. Market players said the divergent trend was due to arbitrage. Birla Global registered a gain of 5 per cent to end at Rs 150. Indo Gulf opened at Rs 200, rose to an intra-day high of Rs 203.10, before closing at Rs 186.95, up from Fridays close of Rs 169.25. 

 The Indian Rayon scrip, on the other hand, ended lower at Rs 578.40 after beginning at Rs 610 ? a fall of around 6 per cent over its last close. Other AV Birla group shares like Grasim Industries and Hindalco, which were not part of the revamp, also gained.

 On the BSE, the volume of business fell sharply to Rs 3106.14 crore from Rs 3807.94 crore last Friday.

 While heavyweights like Reliance and ONGC scored well, the banking sector saw brisk buying after Union finance minister P. Chidambaram last Saturday asked nationalised banks to lead the consolidation drive.

 Daimler sells Mitsubishi stake

 Tokyo/Frankfurt, Nov. 11 (Reuters): DaimlerChrysler AG drew the final curtain on its ill-fated investment in Mitsubishi Motors Corp. on Friday by selling its entire 12.42 per cent stake in the Japanese car maker.

 Investment bank Goldman Sachs bought the stake and was placing the shares with institutional investors around the world, a financial source said. 

 Goldman Sachs, however, declined comment on its purchase of DaimlerChryslers nearly 548.4 million Mitsubishi shares.

 DaimlerChrysler, the worlds fifth-biggest carmaker, said exiting the Mitsubishi investment that it once saw as a pillar would boost its 2005 financial income by around 500 million euros.

 The fate of DaimlerChryslers reduced ownership of Japans only unprofitable car maker had been a subject of speculation after the German-US auto giant cut off its financial lifeline to its former affiliate in April 2004.

 The Stuttgart-based Daimler, which still has some close operational tie-ups with Mitsubishi, such as the joint development of engines and vehicle platform sharing, had repeatedly said it would hold on to its former partners stake.

 The partners said the existing projects with the Japanese car maker would not be affected by Daimlers disposal of the shares, adding the companies planned to extend mutually beneficial projects.

 Analysts lauded DaimlerChryslers move. Daimler showed good timing with the sale, said Michael Punzet, an analyst at Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz. The money will help offset the financial burden from its planned job cuts, he added, referring to the reduction of 8,500 staff at the premium Mercedes division in high-cost Germany.

 Daimler said the cuts would cost it 950 million euros in total. 

 Morgan Stanley noted that the Mitsubishi stock had traded as low as 72 yen after an in-house revolt forced Daimler chief executive Juergen Schrempp to pull the plug on financial aid. The stock was 2.6 per cent down before the news broke.

 Since DaimlerChrysler refused Mitsubishi further help, the Japanese auto maker has been bailed out by sister companies in the Mitsubishi group and investment funds through their purchase of new shares, reducing Daimlers controlling 37 per cent stake.

 If shares held by group companies are included, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. will still be its top shareholder with a combined 13.9 per cent as of end-September, the auto maker said.

 A source familiar with the matter said DaimlerChrysler probably sold off the shares to Goldman Sachs for a substantial discount of up to 18 per cent to Mitsubishis current share price. The stock price, many believe, is still overvalued.

 Daimler last year sold its stake in Koreas Hyundai Motor Co Ltd and is divesting its heavy diesel motor unit MTU Friedrichshafen. 

 It could use the cash from asset sales to top up pension contributions, finance restructuring of its Smart minicar business, invest in new models or channel money to investors via dividends.

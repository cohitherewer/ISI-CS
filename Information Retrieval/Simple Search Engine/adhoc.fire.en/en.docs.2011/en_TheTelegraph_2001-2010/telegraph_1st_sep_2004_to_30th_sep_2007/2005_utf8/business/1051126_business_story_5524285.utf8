 Calcutta, Nov. 25: The Bengal government today gave an indication of an out-of-the-court settlement with Purnendu Chatterjee on Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL), thus signalling a thaw in the icy relationship between the two.

 As a first step, Chatterjee will have to withdraw the case before the Company Law Board. The Chatterjee Group had moved CLB after the state government sold 7.5 per cent shares of HPL to Indian Oil Corporation. The TCG boss will have to simultaneously submit a proposal to the state, outlining the contours of the settlement.

 Chatterjee, who had been seeking truce with the Bengal government, had an hour-long meeting with state industry minister Nirupam Sen at Writers Buildings today. The meeting was also attended by industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen and HPL board member Subhasendu Chatterjee, brother of Purnendu.

 After the meeting, Nirupam Sen said the TCG chief wanted an amicable settlement. We are open to the idea. He should give us a proposal. There is no deadline for that. He will have to withdraw the case before CLB for the negotiations to begin, he said.

 Chatterjee said, Both of us agreed to find an amicable settlement to put an end to the present imbroglio. The process began today and will be followed by a series of dialogues.

 However, Purnendus objection to Indian Oil gaining a management control in HPL became clear when he said, I have told the minister that HPL cannot become a global industrial conglomerate if it becomes a subsidiary of any company.

 When asked whether the amicable settlement will also involve IOC, Chatterjee promptly replied it would consider all issues.

 He reiterated his intention to buy the shares of the Bengal government and added that his investment in HPL was not a financial decision. My mother had told me to do something for Bengal. And so I did it, he added. 

 Chatterjee, however, did not say whether he would be ready to buy the shares of the Bengal government at Rs 29. At this price, the TCG chief would have to shell out Rs 1560 crore for buying the state governments 36.87 per cent stake. 

 The total equity size of HPL is Rs 1410 crore.

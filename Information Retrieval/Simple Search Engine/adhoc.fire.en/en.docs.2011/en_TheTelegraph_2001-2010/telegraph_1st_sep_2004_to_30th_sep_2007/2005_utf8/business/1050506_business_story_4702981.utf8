The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Mall magnet

 - Shopping bags on your shoulders, get ready to splurge as a retail revolution is 

set to sweep the citys sidewalks with Marks amp; Spencer, Mango and more

 ?It took me nearly 20 minutes to get my car parked, but it was wonderful to be a part of the huge crowd. It was a carnival atmosphere, almost like a Puja day!? gushes Moushumi Basu, an executive with a private insurance company, referring to her visit to City Centre on Poila Baishakh.

 Footfalls might not always border on the fantastic, and many retailers forking out a tidy sum for the floor-plate pie they occupy may not be exactly ecstatic yet about conversions at the cash tills. Still, Calcutta remains in the grip of mall-eria, and titillated by the promise of even bigger and better magic marts in the offing.

 Forum, 22 Camac Street, City Centre, Metropolis ? the city seems to have lapped up all those up and running. With the South City Mall, Forum II, Mani Square, City Centre II, Lake Mall, Axis and Diamond City North, all waiting to tee off over the next 36 months, Calcutta seems to be in the swing of things. Kishore Biyani of Pantaloons fame has reportedly signed a transaction for a large Central format mall in the city as well.

 The metros position in the eyes of national players is now well-established and over the past two years, it has proven itself to be an attractive market for all categories of retailers, feels Forum MD Rahul Saraf. The Centres ?look-east policy? and the citys gradual progression to becoming a logistic hub for road and air connectivity will further boost the retail scenario, he predicts.

 The roadmap ahead reflects the buoyancy. ?Organised retail has a huge future here. Calcutta, Howrah and Rajarhat together can comfortably take in 10 to 12 more malls in the coming three to four years,? says Abhijit Das, associate director, Chesterton Meghraj. According to information available with the international property consultant now having dedicated city operations, there are 20-22 retail projects of various formats, which are currently under various stages of planning and implementation in Calcutta.

 These projects dont include the smaller format spaces coming up along with or within upcoming and announced large residential complexes. The total retail stock would add up to over 7 million sq ft of retail space in Calcutta, excluding the four operational malls. Besides, big players from Mumbai and Delhi are also scouting for land to create retail space. Even overseas real estate players are scanning investment opportunities in retail here.

 But is there room for all? ?There will be a paradigm shift from the unorganised to the organised basket, as has happened in other developing countries like Thailand and Brazil, and most players in the unorganised sector will have to come under some big-brand umbrella to stay afloat,? says Saraf. He forecasts 2007 would be a ?watershed year? for retail, with major realignment of forces as most of the projected malls would become functional by then.

 Given that iconic international brands like Marks amp; Spencer, Mango, Bali and Nine West are all in queue to set up shop in town, the immediate outlook has to be bright, say market watchers. ?I am convinced we have only scratched the surface and there is much more to come,? says Sumit Dabriwal, member, core group, retail, Confederation of Indian Industry, eastern region.

 Pawan Agarwal, director, NAI-NK Realtors, points out that the ?exponential growth of the service industry, specially IT, has led to the emergence of high-salary, below-30 splurgers, who are the main drivers of the retail boom?. He attributes the geographical proximity to the Northeast, Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan as another plus that should sustain the retail revolution sweeping the citys sidewalks.

 Of course, me-too malls catering to the same catchment area might not be such a great idea. One way of remaining sustainable even in a smaller format, though, is setting up specialised malls like Fort Knox (the jewellery mall coming up on Camac Street), Silver Arcade (the food mall planned on the EM Bypass) or Block by Block (the one-stop home mall being built at Rajarhat). More such ?narrow malls? are in the pipeline.

 Saraf feels Calcutta hasnt ?over-projected? the market potential like Delhi or Mumbai. ?The mall mania in those two metros will be hard to sustain, as too many similar properties are coming up in close proximity to one another, triggering fears of overheating. Calcutta, by contrast, is slower and steadier and has an inherent advantage, since most retailers dont come here with too high expectations,? he offers.

 Chesterton Meghraj, which seeded leading retailers in Forum and City Centre, points out some ?virgin catchments? like north Calcutta, Howrah and Behala/New Alipore, which are high-potential areas for organised retail developments. ?These areas will not take in malls positioned on the lines of Forum or City Centre, but are extremely potent catchments for properties like The Metropolis,? says Chestertons Das.

 Goldman Sachs eyes merchant banking 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Dec. 7: Goldman Sachs plans to enter the merchant banking sector in India, its president and COO Lloyd C. Blankfein said.

 He said the global player in international banking services also planned to ramp up its headcount in its Bangalore centre by 700 by March 2006.

 Goldman Sachs has already invested $30 million at its Bangalore centre, which employs 800 people. Its Bangalore centre, spread over three acres, can accommodate 1500 associates. 

 We will do more in terms of direct investment and also expand our operations, Blankfein said on the sidelines of a meeting at the Indian School of Business here. 

 He said priority sectors for investment would be people, merchant banking, financial services.

 Blankfein said Goldman Sachs was considering entering the merchant banking sector in India. 

 We are bullish on the tech sector growth in India and look forward to every opportunity to invest in India, he said. 

 On behalf of the Goldman Sachs Foundation, he also announced a second grant of $1 million to the Indian School of Business to set up a centre for analytical finance. 

 The foundation has already provided a grant of $1 million to the institute a year ago to shape up its institutional banking faculties. 

 On partnerships, Blankfein said the firm was open to partnerships as and when necessary. 

 Currently, it is a 25 per cent partner in the joint venture investment bank, Kotak Mahindra Capital Company Ltd, besides holding a 25 per cent interest in Kotak Securities Ltd.

 India is a fabulous place to invest, said Blankfein, who was on his maiden visit to the country.

 Calcutta, Dec. 26: Syngenta, the Switzerland-based agri-business company, is planning to set up a radio chemistry laboratory in Bengal.

 The company has appointed city-based Chemgen Pharma International, a private contract research organisation of the California-based KPC group, to conduct the feasibility study, said Jyoti Chatterjee, president, Overseas Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OBCCI).

 Chatterjee was speaking at a session organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI) here today. He is also the president and chief executive officer of ITeMAX, the technology services outfit of the KPC Group.

 Syngenta is headquartered in Basel, Switzerland, and is a manufacturer of radioisotope products. It is also engaged in medicinal chemistry, Chatterjee said.

 Chemgen is expected to complete the feasibility study on radioisotope products and applications by January and, if viable, the first phase of the project would come up by the end of next year, he added.

 Syngenta is a global major in crop protection and ranks third in the high-value commercial seeds market. The company registered sales of $7.3 billion in 2004 and employs over 20,000 people in more than 90 countries. It is listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange. While Syngenta is already present in the country, this would be their first foray into radioisotope and medicinal chemistry, Chatterjee said. The Indian outfit operates two business divisions ? seeds and crop protection. It is listed on Bombay and Calcutta stock exchanges. 

 On November 15, BCCI signed an MoU with the newly formed US-based OBCCI. The objective is to create an enabling environment for exchange of economic information and to channel investments by liasing with NRI entrepreneurs, said Aniruddha Lahiri, BCCI president and ABP Ltd managing director.

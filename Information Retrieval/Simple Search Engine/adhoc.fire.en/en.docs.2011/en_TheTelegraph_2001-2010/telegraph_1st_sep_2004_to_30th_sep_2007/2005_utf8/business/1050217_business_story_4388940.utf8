 SAT roots for advance ruling authority

 Mumbai, Feb. 16 (PTI): The Securities Appellate Tribunal has suggested setting up of an advance ruling authority in the capital market headed by a high court judge with its order binding on the Securities and Exchange Board of India.

 ?After the amendment to Sebi?s informal guidance scheme, all entities have been covered under the authority. But the ruling has no binding on Sebi,? SAT presiding officer Kumar Raja Ratnam said here today.

 Ratnam said there is need for an authority where rulings are binding on Sebi. If it is created, 50 to 70 per cent of the cases before Sebi and SAT, can be avoided.

 Sebi extends informal guidance to investors after charging Rs 25,000. But the subsequent ?no action letter? stating that it would not take any responsibility on investment decisions, nullifies the guidance, he said.

 Once such an authority in place, a foreign or domestic investor can approach Sebi before investing. The case will be referred to a panel within the authority. Its ruling will be binding on Sebi, Ratnam said.

 ?The authority is necessary in India as regulations are constantly changing. Such bodies are already functioning in countries like North America, Europe, Japan and Pakistan and will be in the interest of the investor public to have such an authority in our securities market,? he said. 

 At present, there is an authority for income tax, customs duty and central excise.

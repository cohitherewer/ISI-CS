 Calcutta steals a march in ATM use

 Calcutta, Dec. 21: Bengal might have been a late starter in the IT race, but a latest survey on the use of automated teller machines (ATMs) showed that Calcuttans are well ahead of other metros.

 In the last two years, more people in the city have taken a fancy to ATMs, much higher than any other metros in India, indicating that more men on the street are getting tech-savvy everyday.

 The study commissioned by NCR Corporation, a leading ATM vendor in the country, shows that 35.7 per cent of the respondents in the city have started using ATMs in the last one year ? the growth is more than any other metro in India.

 If the last two years are taken together, as many as 71 per cent people have been using ATMs here. The figure is again more than the 12 cities covered by the study.

 All nationalised and private banks have expanded their ATM networks in and around the city making customers aware of the advantages. And Calcuttans seem to have lapped it up, a banking industry official said.

 The preference for ATM seems to have stemmed from the fact that this city perceives it as a safe mode of banking, more than branch banking.

 In contrast, cities like Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai feel that branch banking is a safer mode of transaction than ATMs.

 For Calcutta, this clearly throws up the facets of the changing time that people here are also ready to move ahead and not averse to changes, a NCR Corporation official said.

 However, compare to ATM banking, other new-age modes such as phone banking and Internet banking are perceived rather unsecure.

 The study, carried out by AC Nielsen with a sample size of 2,637 users across 12 cities in India, also reveals that 50 per cent of the respondents in Calcutta access ATMs at least once a week or more. 

 However, the city scores poor in phone banking and Internet banking because it believes that these channels are not as secure as ATMs.

 The study also reveals that users clearly demarcate different channels for different transactions. While ATMs are used the most for cash withdrawals (95 per cent), the maximum transactions at branches are for deposits (60 per cent).

 Moreover, a high number of respondents showed a clear interest in new applications through ATMs. About 75 per cent of the respondents indicated that they would use ATMs for cheque deposits, if the banks use a new intelligent deposit technology (with scanned cheque image as receipt).

 Post office money

 The government is likely to introduce a quick money withdrawal scheme on the lines of any time money through ATMs in post offices to facilitate easier money transactions, Communications minister Dayanidhi Maran told Lok Sabha today.

 Pension bill in House amid stiff protest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chidambaram: Tough job

 New Delhi, March 21: Members of the Left parties today staged a walkout in the Lok Sabha to oppose the introduction of a bill to set up an authority to regulate pension funds. 

 The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill, 2005, introduced by Finance minister P. Chidambaram, will replace an ordinance promulgated on December 29, 2004. 

 Left members were protesting against the ?unnecessary? hurry the government was displaying in bringing in a regulator with broad powers.

 The bill ostensibly seeks to set up a regulator for a new pension scheme the government brought in last year. However, it has the powers to regulate any pension scheme or pension fund which come in. 

 The Lefts fear is that the bill will be ultimately used to bring in foreign pension funds into the country. 

 Opposing the bill, V. Radhakrishnan of the CPM questioned the urgency to promulgate an ordinance since the new pension scheme is already in operation from January 1, 2004, through a notification. 

 Supported by Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee, the Left put up a spirited fight in the House. Gurudas Dasgupta of the CPI said the bill was an ?open backdoor policy? followed by the finance minister who was ?playing his cards close to his chest?. 

 BJP Parliamentary Party sources said the party would support the passage of the bill but the partys deputy leader Vijay Kumar Malhotra criticised the government for coming out with ordinances which, he felt, were unwarranted.

 Chidambaram termed the bill as well within the legislative competence of Parliament and assured members that efforts would be made to allay their apprehensions during the debate on the bill. 

 Chidambarams contention was that an early legislative mandate was necessary as the new pay-as-you-go pension scheme was already in place but ?without the full architecture and a statutory regulatory mechanism.? More than 40,000 new central government employees are mandatorily covered by the new scheme since January last year.

 Seven states ? Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Manipur, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu ? have already notified and introduced a defined contribution pension scheme. The authority, a six-member body, will have powers to license, register and supervise pension funds. 

 It will prescribe investment guidelines, accounting standards and disclosure norms for fund managers. It will also fix and review fees charged by various players to schedule determination of these fees to prevent the start up costs from getting embedded in the system.

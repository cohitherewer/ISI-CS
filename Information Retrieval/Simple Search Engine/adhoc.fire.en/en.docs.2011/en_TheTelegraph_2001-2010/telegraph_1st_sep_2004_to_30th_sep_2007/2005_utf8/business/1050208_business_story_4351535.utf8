 Two-fold rise in tea imports

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: Imports of tea and coffee have more than doubled during the first eight months of the current fiscal over the same period of the previous year. 

 However, the overall import of sensitive items declined 0.5 per cent to Rs 12,462 crore from Rs 12,520 crore for the same period of 2003-04, according to official data released today. 

 Imports of tea and coffee went up to Rs 98.86 crore during this period, which is more than twice the corresponding figure of Rs 43.5 crore for the first eight months of the last fiscal.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath said the sharp fall in the import of crude palm oil has contributed significantly to the overall decline in the import of sensitive items. The import of edible oil, cotton and silk, spices and milk and milk products have also shown a decline during this period.

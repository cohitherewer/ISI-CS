 Art fund rises on Osian?s landscape

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Connoisseur?s choice

 Mumbai, May 22: Osian?s ? an art auction house that has the big names of India Inc as shareholders ? is planning a fund to cash in on the sudden surge in interest of institutions in art as an investment.

 Neville Tuli, chairman and founder of the auction house, is upbeat. Five years after setting up the auction house, Osian?s Connoisseurs of Art Ltd has declared a maiden dividend of 10 per cent after the auction house registered a turnover of Rs 7.1 crore and a profit of Rs 2.8 crore in 2004-05.

 Osian?s is fine-tuning a contemporary art fund in the next six months with a corpus of Rs 60 crore, which will subsequently be scaled up to cross Rs 500 crore.

 This is an ambitious venture as the organised art market is Rs 650 crore, but Tuli is unfazed. The segment in India is growing by almost 30 per cent per annum, he said.

 The fund will trade in works of art and will start with a base of 40 artists. It will be structured as a trust. Ernst amp; Young will conduct the due diligence.

 Osian?s move comes at a time when more and more investment banks in India are looking at art as an investment for their clients and are advising them to buy art, which can provide attractive returns like real estate or equity.

 As an example of the scale of business involved, Tuli said selling a Souza painting could fetch a house at Malabar Hill in Mumbai. (A small house in that vicinity is worth a crore).

 The shareholders of Osian?s include Shiv Nadar of HCL Infosystems, Kumar Mangalam Birla of the Aditya Birla group, Gautam Thapar of the Thapar group, Priya Paul of the Apeejay group, Jerry Rao of Mphasis. ?They have invested in Osians in their individual names,? Tuli said.

 Osian?s is building a huge database on the history of contemporary Indian art, its artists and also diversifying into film memorabilia. Tuli also plans to set up an art university, which will be the first of its kind in the country.

 ?Indians are natural hoarders and not collectors,? Tuli laments.

 Osians has prepared an exhaustive library and databank on artists and details of the sale or resale of their paintings. 

 ?The company began with Rs 15 crore and its worth Rs 145 crore,? Tuli said.

 Osians is also collecting modern art that is not merely paintings. It includes Indian popular art, including film memorabilia, advertisements, calendars, toys, handicrafts and decorative arts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Hind Motors in recast mode

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Old order changeth

 Calcutta, Feb. 18: The board of Hindustan Motors will meet tomorrow in Delhi to restructure the company?s businesses. 

 Market grapevine has it that the country?s oldest carmaker is looking at hiving off two of its units to a separate entity and inducting a private equity partner in it. Moreover, the C K Birla-owned company was also looking at selling its property at the Uttarpara plant near Calcutta for real estate development.

 Company officials refused to comment.

 However, the stock market seems to have an inkling of what to expect from tomorrow?s meeting. Hindustan Motors? stock touched a 52-week high of Rs 34.40 before closing at Rs 33.45, up by Rs 0.95 or 2.92 per cent. Over 1.4 crore shares were transacted on the Bombay Stock Exchange, while 3.3 crore changed hands on the National Stock Exchange.

 Hindustan Motors, which has been reeling under heavy losses for years now, turned corners during the quarter ended December 31. It has posted a profit of Rs 1.76 crore over net sales of Rs 242.72 crore.

 Hindustan Motors has four plants in the country. The company rolls out Mitsubishi Lancer from Tiruvallur (Chennai) in technical collaboration with Mitsubishi Motors, Japan. 

 The Pithampur plant (Indore) manufactures fuel-efficient engines and transmissions based on technology from Isuzu Motors and Mitsubishi Motors, Japan. This plant also houses the road trusted vehicle division, manufacturing the RTV brand of multi-utility vehicles, in technical collaboration with OKA Motor Company, Australia. 

 The automobile division at Uttarpara makes passenger car ? the Ambassador ? and multi utility vehicles ? the Trekker, Porter and Pushpak. The Hosur (Bangalore) factory, on the other hand, produces automatic transmissions for heavy-duty vehicles. 

 Observers said the Chennai and Indore plants could be hived off to form a separate company. The company could also look at hiving off the Chennai plant with Mitsubishi taking a majority stake in the company.

 However, it is certain that the company is looking at monetising the Uttarpara facility, which has over 740 acres of land. Rumour is rife in the Real estate sector that the company was looking at selling 540 acres of land for township development. Hindustan Motors has moved the Bengal government for development of the land for real estate. A group, developing townships across the country, is said to be the frontrunner for the land.

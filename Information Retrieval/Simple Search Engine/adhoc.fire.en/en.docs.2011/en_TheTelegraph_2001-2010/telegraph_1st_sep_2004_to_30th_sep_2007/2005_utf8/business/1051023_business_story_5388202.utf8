 New Delhi, Oct. 22: Volkswagen subsidiary Skoda Auto India today said it was not aware of any plans by Audi to partially use its Aurangabad facility for manufacturing or assembling luxury cars. 

 The domestic automobile market has been rife with the speculation that Audi, another Volkswagen group company, was planning to enter the Indian market by partly utilising Skoda India?s plant.

 ?I am not informed of any such decision and neither have I been formally approached on this matter,? said Imran Hassen, managing director, Skoda Auto India, who was in the capital to announce the company?s 32nd dealership in Gurgaon near Delhi.

 Sources said this would have been a possibility had Audi decided to assemble its cars here in India by importing completely knocked down or semi-knocked down kits from its Germany factory.

 Earlier, senior Audi officials had pointed at high import costs as the biggest hurdle for entering into India. 

 High import tariffs and the difficulties in indigenisation are some of the issues confronting the India operations of foreign carmakers. 

 Meanwhile, Skoda Auto India is expanding its capacity from 15,000 to 30,000 cars by the end of this year.

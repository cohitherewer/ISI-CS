 First SAIL payout in seven years

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 27: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) has announced a dividend after a drought of seven long years. 

 The steel major, which had slipped into the red after a messy and costly modernisation programme in the 1990s, today announced a 15 per cent interim dividend. The cash-strapped central government will get a small bonanza of Rs 531.7 crore as a result.

 SAIL?s third-quarter net profit stood at Rs 1,514 crore, a 105 per cent increase over the corresponding period last fiscal. Taking all three quarters together, the PSU giant has increased its net profit by 176 per cent to Rs 4,139 crore. The company?s sales turnover in the first three quarters has touched Rs 21,558 crore, a growth of 27 per cent over the corresponding period of the last fiscal.

 Bhilai and Bokaro continue to be the biggest profit-making units, turning in total profits of Rs 2,490 crore and Rs 2,363 crore respectively. 

 The high profitability is in part due to a steep increase in the prices of steel products in the domestic market over the last two years and in part a result of a cost squeeze that the steel major has undertaken. 

 SAIL chairman V. S. Jain said, ?All seven of our units have done well and six have turned in an operating profit. Only one unit ? the Durgapur-based Alloy Steels Plant ? is still in the red but even that plant has reduced losses to just Rs 10 crore in this quarter.?

 Jain also said the steel major, which had sent a team to Australia to appraise coal mines in which it could pick up equity stakes, had submitted a report and SAIL would buy into these mines in the future.

 SAIL had gone through a harrowing time last year trying to find high-grade coal after an Australian mining group, with which it had a supply agreement, was unable to fulfil its supply commitments in the face of rising global prices.

 Jain said a government plan to merge Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO) with SAIL is likely to be formally approved soon. ?We are sorting out a few problems like mining lease renewals.?

 The BJP-led Jharkhand government had ordered seizure of three prime iron ore blocks ? Sukhil, Dhobil and Ajita ? from IISCO?s Chiria mines recently, prompting the steel major to press the panic buttons.

 IISCO?s lease over the huge and commerically lucrative Chiria mines area, known to be Asias largest iron ore belt, actually expired in 1979. It subsequently sought renewal of the lease but this was held up due to bureaucratic wrangling. But legally, IISCOs leaseholder rights continued as a ?deemed leasee?.

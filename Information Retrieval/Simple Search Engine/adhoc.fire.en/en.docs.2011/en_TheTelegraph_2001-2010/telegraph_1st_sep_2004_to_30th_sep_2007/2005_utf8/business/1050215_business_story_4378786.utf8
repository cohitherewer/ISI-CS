 Calcutta, Feb. 14: The working group on PC penetration, utilisation and Internet usage will submit its recommendations on March 31.

 Ajai Chowdhry, chairman and CEO of HCL Infosytems and a member of the working group, said, ?The growth of the domestic market, both in hardware and software, is a key criteria for an integrated development of the IT industry. We will examine issues related to PC, Internet and multilingual content for the growth of the overall industry.?

 Other members of the working group, formed by the department of information technology, include DIT joint secretary M. Madhavan Nair, MAIT executive director Vinnie Mehta, NIIT chairman Rajendra Pawar, VSNL director N. Srinath, Sify managing director R. Ramaraj, Wipro?s Anil Jain and Nasscom president Kiran Karnik.

 The recommendations will create a roadmap for the next three to four years that will help balance growth in both the hardware and software industry, besides focusing on growth in the domestic market. The hardware industry has already suggested that the depreciation rate of PCs be raised to 100 per cent from the current 60 per cent.

 An excise duty of 8 per cent and a uniform value-added tax (VAT) of 4 per cent on all IT products are some of the other major recommendations.

 Chowdhry also said PC prices have to be brought down to affordable rates with no compromise on quality or technology to penetrate the huge tertiary market.

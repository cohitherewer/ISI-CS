 Mutuals under investor-limit glare

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 31: Mutual funds of HDFC, Franklin Templeton, Kotak, Reliance, Standard Chartered and HSBC have decided to wind up plans that are unable to meet the Sebi deadline of December 31 on big investors? concentration.

 Ninety-one schemes, in which select investors have a dominant share of the fund?s assets, faced closure if they were unable to meet the deadline set by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

 Of these, the fate of five schemes of HDFC, two of Franklin Templeton, one of HSBC, six of Kotak, seven of Standard Chartered and 17 of Reliance have already been sealed.

 Last year, Sebi had directed mutual funds to ensure that no investor had more than 25 per cent share of the scheme corpus. Also, it had capped the minimum number of investors per scheme at 20. While new funds were required to fulfil the criteria immediately, existing ones were given the December 31 deadline to comply with the orders. Any scheme not following the guideline by the set deadline would be wound up without appeal to the regulator.

 However, according to data available till September 30, 2004, 91 mutual fund schemes are still to comply with the dictate. While four of them have only one investor owning 100 per cent of the assets, 47 had one or two investors in command of more than 50 per cent assets.

 Single large investors controlled around 9 per cent of the total mutual fund assets. Except for JM Mutual, GIC and Morgan Stanley Mutual Fund, all other houses had at least one scheme with a single large investor. Most of these schemes are now facing the threat of immediate closure because of non-compliance by the end of this year.

 In their half-yearly results, the fund houses disclose the number of large investors holding more than 25 per cent of corpus and the extent of their collective holdings in any of their schemes.

 The new Sebi rules provide a three-month period from the date of initial public offer closure for new schemes to comply, while close-ended schemes, fixed maturity plans (FMP) and exchange traded funds (ETF) that were already in existence are exempted, given the nature of such schemes. 

 Up to September 2004, six mutual fund schemes with only one investor included Standard Chartered, Principal and Magnum asset management companies. Fund experts believe that retail investors should largely stay away from such schemes. 

 In such schemes, dominance of large investors could hit the interests of smaller ones. Any exits by such investors could make fund management difficult for the schemes? fund manager. By the end of this year, one might largely not have to worry about such schemes.

 Vaghela: New initiative

 New Delhi, April 15: The government today announced the national jute policy aiming at a five-fold increase in jute exports to Rs 5,000 crore in the next five years from the present level of Rs 1,000 crore.

 ?The policy provides for setting up of a national jute board, which will address all issues in the sector and formulate policies to take the exports to Rs 5,000 crore by 2010,? Union textiles minister Shankersinh Vaghela told reporters after unveiling the policy.

 The board will subsume, merge and integrate functions of various institutions like jute diversification board and jute development and manufacturing council, besides providing for an export promotion council.

 With a view to encouraging technology upgradation in the sector, he said textiles ministry had asked the finance ministry to provide for 25 per cent capital subsidy for select machinery in jute sector and he expected a positive response on the issue.

 Vaghela said the ministry had sought an extra allocation of Rs 350 crore in the outlay for jute technology mission from the Planning Commission and was also planning to revive two jute mills in Bengal, which had been shut down earlier.

 ?We are planning to revive two out of six ailing jute mills and a proposal has already been sent to the board for restructuring of public sector enterprises. We are also bringing out a voluntary retirement scheme for the workers of all mills,? he said.

 The Planning Commission has in principle sanctioned Rs 460 crore for the technology mission for the jute industry and it will be sent to the cabinet committee on economic affairs for approval.

 The government also plans to take steps to see that jute replaces synthetics in the packaging sector. 

 Vaghela said the decision was in accordance with the commitment made in the UPA government?s common minimum programme for encouraging diversification of jute.

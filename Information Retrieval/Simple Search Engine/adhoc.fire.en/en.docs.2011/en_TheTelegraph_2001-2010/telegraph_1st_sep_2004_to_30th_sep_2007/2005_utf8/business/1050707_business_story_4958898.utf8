 Stand-alone refineries to feel the heat

 Squeeze more

 New Delhi, July 6: The government is likely to ask standalone refineries ? Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd and Chennai Petroleum Corporation ? to share the subsidy-burden and reimburse Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum. The move will help oil marketing companies reduce losses for the first quarter. 

 The public-sector oil refineries would join ONGC, OIL and Gail in sharing the subsidy burden of the marketing companies. 

 The three companies have paid Rs 6,000 crore for the financial year ended March 31 to IOC, HPCL and BPCL as part of their share of the subsidy burden. They might have to shell out more this year as oil prices have appreciated. 

 A senior petroleum ministry official said the government?s ?subvention? would probably enable IOC to scrape through a wafer thin profit, while HPCL, BPCL and IBP would end up with reduced losses. 

 Oil companies have informed the petroleum ministry that they are headed for a loss of Rs 4,500 crore. The government is concerned over blue-chip oil firms plunging into the red for the first time. 

 The official said the government is drawing up a new export-linked price for petroleum products in order to exclude the notional customs duty and transport costs, which get added to the cost in the present import-parity based pricing system. It results in high refinery margins, while oil-marketing companies suffer. 

 The petroleum ministry is of the view that the current ad hoc steps taken to manage oil companies, who have to hold prices despite the crude rally, will have to be replaced by a new formula. ?Under this system there will be no option to make ONGC and OIL, which make windfall gains when crude prices soar, to shell out more money for the subsidy.? 

 The government has not put in place a new pricing formula as it was widely expected that crude prices would settle down to more realistic levels. However, this does not seem to be happening.

 The finance ministry has made things even more difficult with a distorted tax structure, which brings it more money when prices rise adding to the burden of both consumers and oil companies.

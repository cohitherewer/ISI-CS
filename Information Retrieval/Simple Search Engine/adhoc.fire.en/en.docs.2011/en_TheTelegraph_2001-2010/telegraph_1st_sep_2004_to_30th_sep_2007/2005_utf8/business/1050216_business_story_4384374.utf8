 Posco priority to Paradip for steel project

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 15: Pohang Steel Company (Posco) of South Korea may choose Paradip port in Orissa for its proposed Rs 40,000-crore steel project.

 A three-member delegation headed by Posco president Chang-Oh Kang today visited Paradip along with Orissa chief secretary and a few government officials for the site-selection survey at the port town. 

 State industries minister Biswabhusan Harichandan told The Telegraph that Posco seemed seriously interested in Paradip. ?Things will be clear within a few days after we hold meetings with them,? Harichandan said. 

 Posco experts had earlier visited Dhamra and Duburi in Orissa. But Paradip has an edge over Dhamra and Duburi because of geographical reasons. 

 The soil at Dhamra was not very firm, while the Kalinganagar Industrial complex in Duburi was becoming crowded with several steel projects lined up. Paradip, on the other hand, has proximity to a deepwater port.

 Posco was also interested in setting up a port-based steel plant at Paradip in the early 1990?s. But the project never took off. 

 The proposal of setting up the Rs 40,000-crore steel plant at Paradip was discussed at a high-level meeting presided by state chief secretary Subas Pani. 

 The company sought details on the infrastructure available and commitment from the government on the availability of iron ore, coal and other raw materials. 

 The company needs an iron ore reserve of 1 billion tonnes for its plant and is interested to take up all abandoned mines. 

 A high-level team of Posco had visited Orissa a few months ago and evinced interest to select the location for the proposed steel plant. In December, an investment promotion delegation led by Pani visited Seoul to woo the steel major following reports that the company was scouting for sites in Brazil and other Latin American countries.

 Government sources said the company intended to set up the plant in two phases of 6 million tonnes per annum capacity. The possible South Korean investment of Rs 40,000 crore is said to be the largest ever foreign direct investment in India. For Posco, too, this will be the single largest outbound investment. 

 The Centre is also keenly following the developments and has assured all support for the project, which will put the country in the big league of FDI destinations like China.

 Of the estimated $8.4 billion that Posco plans to bring in, $6.3 billion would be for the steel plant, while the remaining amount will be brought in by its joint venture partner BHP Billiton.

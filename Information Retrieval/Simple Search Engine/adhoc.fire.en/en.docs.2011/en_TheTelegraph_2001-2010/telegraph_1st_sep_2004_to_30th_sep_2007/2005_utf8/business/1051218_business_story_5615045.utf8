 Novel plan to make up for sales tax loss

 Calcutta, Dec. 17 (PTI): The central government is planning to utilise the proceeds of service tax collection for compensating states which would suffer losses due to eventual phasing out of the central sales tax (CST).

 Parthasarathi Shome, adviser to the Union finance minister, said the service tax mopup, which is now being appropriated by the Centre, could be shared with the states as well ? an area already being looked into by the empowered committee on value added tax.

 He said both the Centre and the states could collect the tax and share the kitty. This would be separate from the finance commissions recommendations on devolution of funds to states ? 29.5 per cent of total revenue collection and 1 per cent of additional excise duty (AED). Shome pointed out that the sharing of service tax proceeds would be an alternative to address the revenue loss issue.

 Asked whether this contemplation by the Centre would be reflected in the next budget, Shome said, It could. He added that the government was also planning to synchronise it with excise duty.

 Shome said the coverage and expansion of the base was a forward-looking issue which the government was now dwelling upon. 

 On setting up of large taxpayers unit in five metropolitan cities, Shome said these single window outlets would be opened to minimise the cost of compliance. Large taxpayers will be able to pay both income tax and excise at the same counter. 

 He was speaking at a seminar organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce in the city today.

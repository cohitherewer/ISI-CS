 AirTel puts Northeast in phonebook

 M RAJENDRAN

 Singh: Connect call

 New Delhi, April 11: Sunil Bharti Mittal is preparing for his last hurrah.

 On Wednesday, Mittal ? the country?s first private mobile telephony player ? will establish a beachhead in the Northeast, which will be AirTel?s final frontier. It will signal AirTel?s presence in all 23 telecom circles of the country.

 Mittal will mark the occasion by making a call from Guwahati to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 Singh will receive the call on a mobile in Punjab, where he is due to attend a series of functions after inaugurating the Udhampur railway line in Jammu and Kashmir earlier that day. The significance of that call won?t be lost: Singh began his political journey when he was elected a Rajya Sabha member from Assam.

 Mittal has received the acknowledgement from the Prime Minister?s office on Sunday evening that Singh will receive Airtel?s inaugural call from Guwahati.

 Communications minister Dayanidhi Maran will make a short visit to Guwahati to make the second call to the chief minister of Meghalaya.

 Mittal: Touch tomorrow

 But the buzz in the air is that the launch will also signal the end of one phase in Mittal?s life, which began on August 15, 1995 with the launch of the country?s first mobile phone business in Delhi. He is expected to move away from the day-to-day running of the telecom major and focus on his new areas of interest, like agri-farming and airports.

 Sources in AirTel said: ?This launch is considered very special for AirTel, since it will give the company a footprint across the country. For Mittal, every launch is special, but he holds three circles very close to his heart ?Delhi (the first), Jammu and Kashmir and Northeast.? 

 A senior company executive said AirTel would kickstart the process of establishing new benchmarks in the quality of telecom services. ?We will be the second largest telecom service provider next only to China in a few years,? he added.

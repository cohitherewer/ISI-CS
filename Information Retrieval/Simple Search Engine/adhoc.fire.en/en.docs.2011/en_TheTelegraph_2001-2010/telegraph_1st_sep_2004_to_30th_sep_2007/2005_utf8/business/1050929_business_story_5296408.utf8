 Calcutta, Sept. 28: Income tax collection in Bengal circle has clocked a 25 per cent increase so far this fiscal compared with the same period last year.

 At the beginning of the current financial year, the income tax department had set its eyes on an annual collection of Rs 7,656 crore from the state against a national mobilisation of Rs 1,10,000 crore.

 The tax mop-up in the circle was Rs 2,540 crore till September 20 against Rs 1,984 crore during the corresponding period last fiscal, said P.C. Sinha, chief commissioner, Income Tax. He was speaking at a seminar organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (eastern region).

 Personal income tax collection, however, moved the other way. It has actually gone down by 20 per cent, Sinha pointed out.

 It is because of the substantial increase in corporate tax mop-ups that the overall collection has risen, he added. Tax payments by corporates have increased because their earnings have increased and they now have a healthy balance sheet, explained Sinha.

 Between April 1 and September 15, the total corporate tax collection in the country has increased by 55 per cent to Rs 18,000 crore from Rs 11,600 crore in the same period last year.

 In contrast, personal income tax collections for the period was Rs 18,200 crore, an increase of 17 per cent over Rs 15,600 crore in April-September 2004.

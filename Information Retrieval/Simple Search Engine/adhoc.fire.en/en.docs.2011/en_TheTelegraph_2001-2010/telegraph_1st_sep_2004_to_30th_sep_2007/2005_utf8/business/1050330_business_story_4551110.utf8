 IDFC sets June date for maiden flotation 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 29: Infrastructure Development Finance Company Ltd (IDFC) plans to hit the capital market by June to fund its capital requirements and will soon launch a second infrastructure development fund with a corpus of about Rs 1,300 crore.

 IDFC today bared its key strategies and business plan for the first time after recent controversies saw a transition in the top management.

 ?We are planning to launch an initial public offering depending on the market conditions by June, which will include pro-rata dilution of the existing shareholders and have new investors on the board,? CEO and managing director Rajeev Lall said.

 He, however, did not divulge details about the size of the IPO but said, ?In the Indian scheme of things, it will be a substantial offering.?

 Lall said the government, which has about 35 per cent stake, would continue to be the single largest shareholder, though its stake would come down.

 Under the IPO, which would be part primary and part secondary, there would be pro-rata sale of stake by existing shareholders, while new investors would also pick up equity.

 The company would launch the second infrastructure fund with a corpus of about Rs 1,300 crore and the amount would be raised in the next 8-10 months.

 The fund will have maximum overseas participation and the company has committed bulk of its earlier Rs 850-crore India Development Fund to over five projects, he said.

 ?We are in the pre-marketing stage and would soon launch the marketing for the second fund,? he added.

 Clearing several myths relating to the infrastructure project loans, Lall said, ?The fact that I?m here shows that it is behind us.? Lall was appointed in place of Nasser Munjee, who left in controversial circumstances after he opposed moves to merge the fledgling institution with a PSU bank. Lall has served in senior positions in the Asian Development bank, the World Bank and Warburg Pincus.

 It?s only performance that matters

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: Individual performance is the most important criteria for salary increases among professionals employed in the information technology (IT) industry.

 Both the IT and IT-enabled services (ITES) industries saw an average increase of 8-9 per cent on median salaries across levels compared with 2003.

 Individual performance continues to be the most important criteria for a base pay hike with an average weightage of 80 per cent ? an increase of 10 percentage points over last year.

 However, attraction and retention of employees remain key issues for IT and ITES organisations. The IT industry is reporting an average attrition rate of 18 per cent for the financial year ending March 2003-04; the ITES industry is reporting an even higher average attrition rate of 32 per cent across various levels.

 According to the Nasscom-Hewitt Total Rewards Study 2004, the IT and ITES firms reported a differential compensation positioning basis for rewarding employees.

 The study also found that there was a decline in popularity of pure cash rewards and an increase in the popularity of prizes as means of recognising outstanding individual or team performance.

 Nishchae Suri, business leader consulting, Asia Pacific-Hewitt Associates, said, ?An increasing number of organisations are using the pay for performance philosophy, to build a high-performing organisational culture, which then translates into better business results and company profitability.?

 The study shows that an increasing number of firms lay emphasis on variable pay and align rewards to business goals. More than 85 per cent firms have a variable pay rewards structure. The average fixed variable pay ratio in both the IT and ITES industries was around 90:10. Stock-based plans though prevalent are typically used at senior management levels only.

 Nasscom vice-president Sunil Mehta said, ?Today, the Indian IT industry employs about 820,000 people, and it is, therefore, essential that these firms devise the right compensation and rewards mix to attract and retain talent.?

 Birla Corp on toes for annual meeting

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug 23: The Birla bequest battle is set to spill over to the streets again. On Friday, Section 144, which restricts the number of people who can gather in an area, will be clamped around Uttam Mancha, the venue of Birla Corporations annual meeting. 

 The company has also handed over the names of potential miscreants to Tollygunge police station, which will depute officials at the south Calcutta theatre to prevent any nuisance or apprehended danger. 

 Chairman R.S. Lodha will give a detailed account of the companys performance in 2004-05 at the AGM and unveil future plans. 

 In the past year, Birla Corporation has stunned the market with its performance, the impact of which is evident in the way its stock has rallied. 

 The gain has been 89 per cent. This is higher than the rate at which the sensex and the nifty have risen. The scrip touched a high of Rs 231 ? from Rs 112.05 less than a year ago ? on August 11. It is now hovering around Rs 210.

 We cant expect any trouble given the companys performance. Seeking imposition of section 144 near the venue is a standard practice and thats why we have asked for it, said Ramesh Kumar Damani, company secretary of Birla Corporation. 

 There will be a gathering of over 500 to 600 shareholders and we want law-and-order to be maintained during the meeting, added Damani. 

 While one cannot wish away Damanis argument, seeking protection from administration to hold AGMs is not a common practice among firms in Calcutta. There are few instances of companies seeking Section 144 to hold an AGM, a senior official at the police headquarters in Lalbazar said.

 Lodha has complete control over the affairs of the MP Birla group but no significant announcements are expected on Friday. Therefore, observers view the move as a precautionary step. 

 Last years meeting ?Lodha was the co-chairman at that time ? was high on drama. There was a showdown between shareholders loyal to the Birla family and Lodha. The latter was interrupted time and again by a section of the shareholders, forcing the police to intervene.

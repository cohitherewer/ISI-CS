 Vaishnavi in UK alliance

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 4: Vaishnavi Corporate Communication has tied up with Financial Dynamics of the UK. 

 The strategic alliance will give Vaishnavi?s Indian clients a footprint in the global market. On the other hand, Vaishnavi would serve the clients of Financial Dynamics, who are looking at entering into India.

 Financial Dynamics managing director David Llyod said the company?s services would be especially helpful to Indian companies that were looking at international acquisitions and overseas listings.

 For instance, it helped Tata Motors when it listed on the NYSE sometime back.

 ?Since we work closely with investment bankers, analysts and media, Financial Dynamics provides financial intelligence, investment banking, legal and communication advisory,? Llyod said.

 Vaishnavi-Financial Dynamics duo also plans to market its services to the state governments. ?Many states are now going abroad to rope in investors. Our services will be beneficial to them,? Vaishnavi director, strategic planning, Sudeep Purkayastha said.

 The combine would mainly target customers in the areas of information technology, biotechnology, automobiles and steel.

 The arrangement, which is mutually exclusive, will work on a revenue-sharing basis. Lloyd said Financial Dynamics looked at 14 companies before zeroing in on Vaishnavi. 

 The corporate communications industry is about Rs 100 crore. The Vaishnavi tie-up is third such arrangement after Genesis and Corporate Voices.

 New Delhi, Nov. 11: Idea Cellular is planning to enter the domestic long-distance telephony business.

 CEO Vikram Mehmi said the company would explore the national long-distance market depending on its business plans for the next few years.

 However, he highlighted that there is a possibility of litigation and delay, since most of the existing operators have informally aired their unhappiness with the government?s decision to bring down the entry fee for new operators. 

 Idea will invest Rs 300 crore to start operations in the new networks of Uttar Pradesh (east), Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan. 

 The cellular service provider today launched SUPERPOWER, a prepaid card that would help customers control the validity of the voucher as well as talktime.

 New Delhi, Oct. 4: Electrolux Kelvinator Limited will merge with Videocon Industries next year.

 ?However, a final decision will be taken after the board meeting, which will take place after Diwali,? managing director Anirudh Dhoot said on the sidelines of a festive promotion campaign.

 The Videocon group aims to cash in on the brand name of Electrolux, said company officials.

 Dhoot said with the acquisition of Electrolux India by Videocon in July, the company?s sales had shot up. The company will break even by March 2006, after six months of which we will look at making profits.

 Electrolux, which is targeting a Rs 400-crore turnover by December, is also eyeing an overall sales growth of 40 per cent during the festive season.

 It also hopes to achieve growth of 300 per cent in microwaves and 150 per cent in air conditioners.

 In the forthcoming festive season alone, the company will spend nearly 12 per cent of its turnover on advertisement and promotion exercises.

 The company is also considering integrating its plants in Maharashtra. ?We are working on a possible merger or relocation of our Butibori plant with our plant in Warora. The process of integrating the plant is on,? general manager-marketing Sanjeev Wadhwa said.

 Meanwhile, Electrolux is also planning to relaunch its Kelvinator brand to tap rural areas.

 Wadhwa said Electrolux Kelvinator is planning to launch Kelvinator brand, which deals in refrigerators only. ?The refrigerators produced under the brand would be targeted at low-end rural markets,? he said.

 In the acquisition deal earlier this year, Videocon got the right to market three brands ? Kelvinator, Allwyn and Electrolux ? in India.

 Under the deal, Videocon also took over the three manufacturing plants. It gets an opportunity to tap the global market as it will supply refrigerators and washing machines to Electrolux over the next five years.

 Earlier this year, the Rs 6,000-crore Videocon group took over the entire 91.85 per cent stake of AB Electrolux in its Indian subsidiary.

 AB Electrolux said it will invest about Rs 410 crore in the GDRs of Videocon Industries to take a 5 per cent stake in the company.

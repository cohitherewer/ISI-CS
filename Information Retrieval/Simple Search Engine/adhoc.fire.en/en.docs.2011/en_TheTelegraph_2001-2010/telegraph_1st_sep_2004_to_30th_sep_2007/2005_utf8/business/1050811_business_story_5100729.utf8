 Mittal Steel quarterly profit dips 15% 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 10: Mittal Steel, the worlds largest steel maker, today announced a 15 per cent drop in its quarterly net profit for the three-month period ended June 30. The company, however, expects steel prices to improve in the coming quarters. 

 We are expecting conditions to remain difficult but key economic indicators to improve in the short-term. We believe that the basic fundamentals for the steel industry remain positive and that Mittal Steel is well positioned to further build on its unique global position, Mr Lakhsmi Mittal said.

 Attributing the lower net profits to the inventory de-stocking in the Europe and the US, that caused demand and prices to soften considerably for the quarter under review, Mittal said, the industry response to this has been positive, with various producers, including Mittal Steel, reducing production. 

 Although the available figures reveal that the total steel shipments for the quarter ended June 30 were 12.2 million tonnes (mt) compared with 10.4 mt for the quarter ended March 31 ? an increase of 17.3 per cent over the corresponding quarter last year.

 The rise in the output could have resulted from the merger of International Steel Group with Mittal Steel. The total steel shipments from the American region were 5.4 mt in the reporting quarter compared with 3 mt for the quarter ended March 31.

 Excluding ISG, shipments were lower, primarily due to the de-stocking taking place, the company said.

 The announcement of the consolidated results after the merger of International Steel Group (ISG) with Mittal Steel was completed on April 15 this year. 

 The European region achieved a total steel shipment of 4 mt in the April-June period this year, against 4.6 mt for the previous quarter.

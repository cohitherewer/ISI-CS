 Calcutta, Dec. 27: The Xenitis group will record a turnover of more than Rs 1,000 crore in the next financial year on the back of a buoyant personal computer market.

 The group, which sells computers under the Amar PC brand, is going to do business worth Rs 650 crore this fiscal compared with Rs 180 crore in the previous year.

 The group has also tied up with a Chinese firm to set up a two-wheeler unit at Chinsurah. The plant will start production by May 2006 and roll out 30,000-40,000 two-wheelers per month.

 It also plans to diversify into the consumer electronics segment and introduce low-priced home theatre models called Xtreme.

 We will be a Rs 1,000-crore group by next fiscal, group chairman Santanu Ghosh said here today.

 It will invest Rs 300 crore in various businesses next year, including the two-wheeler unit.

 We are looking at tapping the capital market during the next festive season. The modalities are being worked out at present, group president Ambar Mukherji said.

 Laptop launch

 Xenitis Infotech, the groups IT arm, today launched a range of low-cost laptops under the Xuva brand.

 It will offer eight models in the price range of Rs 29,000-59,000.

 We will focus on the fast growing segment of low-cost laptops and target individuals, small and the medium business sector and suburban markets, Ghosh added.

 The company expects to sell about 10,000 laptops in the domestic market where 1.5-2 lakh units are sold in a quarter.

 Rajesh Gupta, director-sales (channels) of Intel (South Asia), said the laptop market was expected to record a huge growth worldwide in the coming years.

 We project that by 2008, one out of every three PCs sold will be a laptop. The laptop segment is witnessing a 100 per cent year-on year growth in India, he added.

 The laptop range was launched by Bengal IT minister Manab Mukherjee.

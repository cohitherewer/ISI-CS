 HDFC homes in on real estate fund 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 23: HDFC Ltd has made a foray into the real estate fund business by launching the HDFC Property Fund in association with State Bank of India (SBI).

 A trustee company (HDFC Ventures Trustee Company Limited) and an asset management company (HDFC Venture Capital Limited) have been incorporated for the fund. HDFC managing director Keki Mistry said, ?The venture fund is an extension of HDFC?s core business and adds value to its bouquet of services in the real estate sector. We hope this will encourage professionalism and provide depth to this industry.?

 This Sebi-approved venture capital fund will invest in equity and equity-linked instruments of companies engaged primarily in real estate in major cities in India.

 The fund?s initial scheme ? HDFC India Real Estate Fund ? is for domestic investors and has a target corpus of Rs 750 crore with a greenshoe option of Rs 250 crore. This will be a seven-year close-ended fund, which would be privately placed. The scheme will have a minimum contribution of Rs 5 crore per investor and would target banks, insurance firms, companies and high net-worth individuals for investment.

 To achieve a balanced risk-reward profile, the inaugural fund will invest in three broad classes of companies.

 One of these are projects which are complete and investment in them would denote steady income type characteristics, HDFC said.

 The second category comprises projects in the development stage where the lead-time to commercial deployment is typically between one and three years and the completed projects subsequently would have contractual off-take arrangements in place.

 The fund would also invest in projects in the planning stage, where the lead-time to commercial deployment would be 3-6 years. These projects would offer the highest amount of return although with a greater risk, HDFC said.

 HDFC Ltd executive director Renu Sud Karnad, who would be the non-executive chairperson of HDFC Venture Capital Ltd, said, ?Worldwide real estate represents a substantial share of fund allocations by institutional investors. But in India, this had been hampered by the lack of credible mechanisms through which institutions could invest in the sector.?

 With an increase in professional players in the real estate business, coupled with the recent boom, investors want a real estate investment scheme.

 Mumbai, Jan. 27 (PTI): Zee Telefilms Ltd has posted a lower net profit of Rs 82.37 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, on a consolidated basis, compared with Rs 90.19 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.

 Total revenues of the group fell to Rs 339.01 crore (excluding Padmalya Telefilms) for the quarter under review as against Rs 374.57 crore during the corresponding quarter of previous fiscal, the company said in a release here today.

 On a standalone basis, the media company reported a net profit of Rs 38.41 crore for the reporting quarter compared with Rs 36.75 crore posted for the quarter ended December 31, 2003.

 Total income rose to Rs 193.78 crore for the reporting period from Rs 179.38 crore in the corresponding period of last fiscal, it said.

 Zee Telefilms chairman and managing director Subhash Chandra said the company is in an investment phase, with several new channels being added and the DTH business receiving due investments for growth.

 ?The financial performance of the third quarter has to be seen in the context of the start-up phase of these initiatives. We continue to invest for the long term based on promising opportunities available in the industry?, he said.

 On accounting allegations against Padmalya Telefilms, Chandra said a decision on the issue would be taken on Monday.

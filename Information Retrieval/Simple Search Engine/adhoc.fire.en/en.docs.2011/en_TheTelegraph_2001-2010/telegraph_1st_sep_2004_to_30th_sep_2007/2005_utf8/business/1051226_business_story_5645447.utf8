 Q amp;A

 Retire and rest

 I will retire from railway service at the age of 60 on December 31, 2005. On retirement, I shall receive my provident fund, leave salary, gratuity, group insurance, salary arrears and productivity-linked bonus for 2005-06. Are these amounts taxable? Do I have to submit my income tax returns after retirement and can I get senior citizens benefits?

 Arun Goswami, by e-mail

 Salary in arrears received as a lumpsum is liable to tax in the year of receipt. Some relief is, however, allowed from tax on such receipts. Relief is also available for gratuity, leave encashment and other compensations, though the computation of tax benefits will vary according to the heads. Your need to continue filing returns will depend on your post-retirement total income and the one-by-six scheme. However, to be eligible for senior citizen tax benefits, one needs to be 65 years of age and above.

 Home truth

 If two persons jointly own a residential property in Calcutta and one of the owners regularly submits income tax returns, is it necessary for the second owner to do so, if his income is within the exempted limit?

 Amitava Dutta, Calcutta

 Income tax laws require co-owners of any property 

 to assess their income from house property separately. 

 Thus, the second individual is also required to submit 

 his income tax returns under the one-by-six scheme, 

 even though his total income is within the exempted 

 limit.

 Card conundrum

 My employer has given me a credit card with a limit of Rs 50,000. My employer pays the amount I spend on the card every month. Is this amount taxable?

 Ridhima Sinha, by e-mail

 Since assessment year 2005-06, any expenses incurred 

 through the credit card, including the membership and 

 annual fees, which are paid or reimbursed by the employer, 

 was treated as perquisites in the hands of the employee 

 and thereby fully taxable. But, if the expenses were 

 incurred for official purposes, the perquisite value 

 shall be deemed to be nil. However, from the assessment 

 year 2006-07, the value of this perquisite shall be 

 nil, since the same shall be chargeable to fringe benefit 

 tax.

 Bengal in search of shipyard land

 Calcutta, Nov. 30 (PTI): The Bengal government, in association with Calcutta Port Trust, is looking for land for a proposed shipyard of international standards that the Centre has planned for the east coast.

 We need about 150 acres and water draft of 12 meters. We are looking for the land, but it is yet to be finalised, state chief secretary Amit Kiran Deb said today at the inauguration of the CII-sponsored seminar, Infra East.

 The shipping ministry had proposed two shipyards in the country through the Indian Port Association, one each on the east and west coasts. With the shipping sector recording a 29 per cent growth, facilities for ship building capacity are required urgently.

 A delegation of GIC, a global investment management firm that manages Forex of Singapore, is visiting the city. They will meet chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on December 19 to take forward their investment plan.

 Regarding the infrastructure projects in the pipeline for the chemical hub, Deb said Dalal Mott McDonald would do the feasibility study.

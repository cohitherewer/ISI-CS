 Tatas plan Delhi power plant 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 High on energy 

 Calcutta, July 10: Tata Power is planning to set up a 1,000-megawatt thermal power plant in Delhi.

 This will be in addition to the 1,000-mw power plant in Mumbai and a 600-mw hydel power project that the firm will build at Shrinagar in Uttaranchal.

 Ashok Uppal, senior general manager of Tata Power, said the Delhi plant is under consideration and is yet to be approved by the board. However, it will be a thermal power plant and the cost per megawatt will be less than Rs 4 crore, he added.

 The company has already undertaken a due diligence on the proposed coal-based power plant in Mumbai. The fuel for this unit will be imported.

 For its 600-mw hydel power project in Uttaranchal, Tata Power has earmarked an investment of about Rs 1,500 crore. This will include the cost of rehabilitation of the people who may be displaced for the project.

 The Tata company now has an installed power generation capacity of 2278 mw. Its thermal power station at Trombay and the hydroelectric power stations at Bhira, Bhivpuri and Khopoli, account for 1797 mw power generation.

 Tata Power has applied for five coal blocks ? three in Jharkhand, one in Andhra Pradesh and one in Orissa. The total reserve of these blocks is estimated at 2,500 million tonnes.

 Maithon project

 The cost of setting up of the 1,000-mw Maithon Right Bank Project may come down to Rs 3,600 crore. Earlier, the cost was projected at Rs 4,000 crore.

 Maithon project is being developed jointly by Tata Power and Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC). In this joint venture, Tata Power holds a 74 per cent stake, while DVC holds the remaining 26 per cent.

 Uppal said a due diligence study of the project is currently on. But he could not specify a timeframe within which the study will be completed. 

 The project will come up over an area of 1,100 acre. It has received the first clearance for 450 acre of land. 

 Prior to the financial closure, DVC will have the option to enter into a bankable power purchase agreement with the company for buying up to a specified quantum of power. 

 Uppal added that they would approach banks and financial institutions for project financing once the due diligence is over.

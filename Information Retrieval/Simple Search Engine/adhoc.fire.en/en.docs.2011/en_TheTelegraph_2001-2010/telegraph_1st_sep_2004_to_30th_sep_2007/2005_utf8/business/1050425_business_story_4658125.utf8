 MCI falls for sweetened Qwest bid

 Philadelphia, April 24 (Reuters): MCI Inc has declared a $9.9-billion takeover bid from Qwest Communications International Inc superior to its $7.8 billion merger agreement with Verizon Communications Inc, a significant twist in the 3-month-old battle for the No. 2 US long-distance company. 

 MCI had rebuffed Qwest three times in favour of lower offers from Verizon, saying its original partner offered greater financial stability and better growth opportunities for products and services. 

 Verizon, the largest US telephone company, said it would weigh its options. 

 It reiterated that it believed its proposal offered better short- and long-term value for MCIs shareholders, customers and employees, saying it could stabilise the long-distance firm?s finances and protect the integrity of its business and services. 

 Ashburn, Virginia-based MCI did not detail the reasons for changing its recommendation. 

 Some of MCIs large institutional investors have spoken out recently against the lower Verizon bid and urged MCI to negotiate a richer deal with Qwest. 

 Verizon and Qwest have been battling to acquire MCI to gain its presence in the lucrative market for providing telephone and data services to large companies. 

 Qwest, the No. 4 US local telephone company, said it was ?gratified? MCI selected its bid and believed the combination would ?deliver long-term value for investors, robust competition and better services for customers?. 

 Sources familiar with the situation said Verizon did not try to counter Qwests higher offer, but would gauge shareholder reaction over the next few days and weeks before deciding its next move. 

 New York-based Verizon has five business days to respond with a revised proposal. It has other options as well. Verizon could require MCIs shareholders to vote on the existing $7.8 billion agreement, or walk away from the deal and collect a $240 million breakup fee from MCI. 

 MCI could also change its mind. Under Qwests irrevocable offer, MCIs board has until May 3 to change its recommendation back to the Verizon pact. MCI cannot formally sign an agreement with Qwest unless its contract with Verizon is terminated. 

 Previously, MCI said it feared combining with smaller rival Qwest, which has a market capitalisation of $7 billion versus Verizons $100 billion, would spook customers and erode its financial health. 

 Verizon also has a wide array of businesses, including its Verizon Wireless joint venture, the No. 2 US wireless telephone company. 

 In its persistence to wrest MCI away from Verizon, Qwest had altered many aspects of its earlier offers.

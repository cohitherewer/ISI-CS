 Hindalco polishes upgrade charter

 Birla: Rise and shine

 Mumbai, July 12: Hindalco aims to emerge as one of the worlds most cost-efficient producers of copper and aluminium as it morphs into a global non-ferrous metal powerhouse.

 Value-addition will underpin all plans that the company intends to push through to achieve efficiency improvements, leverage the Hindalco-Indal combine in the market and acquire new copper mines at home and abroad.

 Addressing the annual general meeting here today, chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla said a Rs 20,000-crore expansion now under way will raise the alumina capacity at the firms Muri plant to 4.50 lakh tonnes from 1.10 lakh tonnes. It is likely to be through by the third quarter. 

 The Belgaum unit could start producing 6.50 lakh tonnes if a proposal being examined now is accepted. That move, along with a drive to raise high-value special alumina output, is going hand in hand with an increase in Hirakud metal smelters capacity to 1.46 lakh tonnes.

 Once production at the Dahej copper smelter stabilises after a ramp-up to 5 lakh tonnes, Birla said Hindalco will become the worlds largest single-location copper producers. The company will be closer to its goal of being among the top 15 cost-efficient producers globally.

 On Utkal Alumina, Birla said the mining leases for bauxite reserves of over 195 million tonnes have been secured, along with land. Pacts have been signed to set up an aluminium complex in Orissa and a smelter in Jharkhand. Around Rs 2,000 crore will be invested this year. Much of that is being pumped in on forecasts of high aluminium demand in Asia, where growth last year was 13 per cent.

Stock split

 The Hindalco board today approved a proposal to divide shares from Rs 10 to Re 1. Birla told shareholders that this is being done to ensure wider retail participation.

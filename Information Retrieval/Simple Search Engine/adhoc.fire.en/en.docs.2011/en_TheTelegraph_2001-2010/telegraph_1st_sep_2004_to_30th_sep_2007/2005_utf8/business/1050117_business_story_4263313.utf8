 Saudi Aramco offers mega refinery stake

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 16: Saudi Aramco has offered Indian petroleum companies a stake in a huge refinery it plans at home.

 Company president and chief executive officer Abdullah S. Jumah told reporters at Petrotech-2005 that Saudi Aramco would set up a refinery to process 4,50,000 barrels of crude per day and to export higher value-added petroleum products. ?We would like Indian companies to participate in the project,? he added.

 Saudi Arabia is India?s largest supplier of crude, accounting for over 23 million tonnes of the 90 million tonnes imported in 2003-04. ?We are supplying 4,50,000 barrels daily to India and want to increase it further. India is a very important market and we will continue to supply it,? Jumah said.

 Asked if his company would settle for long-term contracts with India, Jumah said the existing one-year deals are ?evergreen? arrangements that will be renewed.

 Jumah said his company was also looking for opportunities to invest in India. ?We were going to bid for the Hindustan Petroleum when it was being privatised but this did not happen,? he said, referring to the manner in which divestment was stalled.

 The Saudi Aramco chief did not mention why his firm left Indian Oil in the lurch by backing out of Paradip refinery at the last minute. 

 The abrupt pullout delayed the project, which had to be reworked; even the clearance process started afresh.

 According to Jumah, Saudi Aramco sells close to 50 per cent of the 9 million barrels of crude that it produces every day to Asian countries. ?Our oil installations are prepared for all kinds of industrial incidents. We have built-in redundancies. Our own security forces and that of the Saudi Arabian government guard facilities against terrorist attacks,? he explained.

 EEPC in pact with China

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 23: The Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC) has signed a memorandum of understanding with the China Chamber of Commerce for the import and export of machinery and electronic products.

 EEPC chairman Rakesh Shah said the visit to Beijing and Shanghai was an ?eye-opener for the 18-member delegation of Indian engineering goods manufacturers?. He said Chinese factories used state-of-the-art precision machines to produce goods of the highest quality and their workers were highly disciplined. 

 The delegation visited four factories in China that manufacture auto components, tractors, farm machinery and bearings. Shah said the Chinese are capable of manufacturing the best products in the world and the impression that they manufacture only shoddy goods to be dumped at cheap prices does not convey the complete picture.

 He said the EEPC would be ?setting up a China desk to exchange information and undertake sector-specific studies to ascertain the market for various products there?.

 The EEPC also plans to exhibit its products at the mega industrial fair being organised by Hannover Messe in Shanghai later this year where buyer-seller meets will be organised.

 Shah said as part of the government?s look-east policy, the EEPC has managed to generate serious business enquiries of $4 million at the recently held Indiatech exhibition in Indonesia.

 UTI Mutual eyes pension fund

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Going for it

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: UTI Mutual Fund, also known as UTI-II, will pitch for managing the new pension fund being set up by the government and a part of the newly-created national investment fund (NIF).

 The parliamentary standing committee on finance has recommended that at least one of the pension fund managers should be a public sector entity. UTI qualifies to be a pension fund manager and we will pitch for it as and when the sector is opened up, said U.K. Sinha, the newly-appointed chief executive of UTI Asset Management Company, which manages the countrys largest mutual fund. 

 Sinha, who was earlier joint secretary (capital markets) in the ministry of finance, has taken over the as the CEO of the mutual fund today. He is on deputation for two years.

 Besides mulling a foray into the pension sector, Sinha is also eyeing a portion of the national investment fund. The government today operationalised the NIF, constituted with the proceeds of divestment of public sector undertakings. The fund will invest in social sector projects and in ailing PSUs to turn them around. 

 The public sector undertaking is also open to acquiring other mutual funds to scale up its operations and is planning to increase its global footprint through UTI International ? its subsidiary for international operations ? in the coming months. Sinha indicated that acquisitions of other mutual funds were very much on the radar for UTI-II. 

 In principle, acquisitions are possible as we are looking for both organic and inorganic growth. Consolidation and shakeout are expected in the mutual fund industry in the coming years. As and when it happens, we have the money, he clarified.

 Size without efficiency cannot fetch the desired benefits, Sinha elaborated. I am not looking at increasing my market share through acquisition alone. I am not ruling it (acquisitions) out, but growth of UTI Mutual Fund from within is our first priority, he said.

 Sinha also plans to expand UTIs global presence. At present, its wholly-owned subsidiary UTI International is present in London, Dubai and Bahrain. We are in the process of setting up offices in Oman and Singapore in the next couple of months, Sinha said. UTI International operates as a foreign institutional investor (FII) in Indian capital market.

 Besides, the mutual fund is also planning to scale up its portfolio management services, which has been started eight months ago. The arm manages funds of high net-worth clients.

 On the domestic front, Sinha refused to set any specific target for scaling up its assets under management.

 Andhra dithers on VW demand

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Oct. 14: The Volkswagen India car project appears to have hit a roadblock as the Andhra Pradesh government has not agreed to its demand for a separate special economic zone (SEZ) at Vishakhapatnam. 

 It appears that the German carmaker wants concessions on a par with the information technology industry. It is pointing to a similar status given to Nokia and Flextronics in Tamil Nadu. 

 But the Andhra Pradesh government is dilly-dallying. It has, however, accepted every other demand, including an 18-year deferment of sales tax. 

 The four-member Volkswagen delegation from Wolfsberg, Germany, led by negotiator and consultancy expert Peter Walters, left this evening without resolving the issue. 

 We could not assure them the SEZ they sought as other multinational carmakers ? Hyundai and Suzuki ? were operating successfully without such a zone, said a state government spokesperson. 

 The state government was in no hurry to agree to everything the Germans wanted. We have asked them to decide independently regarding the viability of setting up a project in Andhra Pradesh, he said. 

 The Germans have invited a delegation from the state to visit Wolfsberg in the first week of November to finalise the business plan. Later, during the same month, the Volkswagen team will visit Hyderabad with a final draft of the MoU, another official said. 

 The project had been stalled in June following exposure of the underhand dealings of the carmakers India representative Helmuth Schuster. 

 Schuster, who was dismissed from Volkswagen service on June 15, had floated a company ? Vashisht Wahan ? in India into which he had coerced the Andhra Pradesh government to invest 2 million euros as its equity stake. 

 The amount was siphoned off by Schuster and his Indian accomplices. 

 Volkswagen initially disowned any links with the tainted Indian company, but later assured to compensate the loss of the state government. 

 The Volkswagen team comprised Patrik Mayer, head of finance, Alfred Strolein and Reber ? attorneys, who spent two days negotiating with the state government team on the project.

 Volkswagen had almost finalised on setting up its plant at Vishakhapatnam for which the state government allocated 350 acres in the prime Parwada area. 

 The German team also visited the area and found it feasible to set up its plant for manufacturing 50,000 cars in the first year and 1 lakh vehicles in full operation.

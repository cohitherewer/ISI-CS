 Fetters on fund shoppers abroad

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: The government today said companies debarred by Sebi from tapping the domestic market will not be allowed to issue GDR/ADRs or convertible bonds abroad. 

 Officials said the change would align foreign fund-raising guidelines with those for domestic issues.

 The overseas route will also be shut for overseas corporate bodies (OCBs) not allowed to make portfolio investments and financial firms forbidden from trading in securities.

 GDRs and foreign funds will have to be priced at the higher of the two averages ? the mean of weekly highs and lows of a share in the past six months, or in the last two weeks.

 The notification also mentions a relevant date, which it defines as 30 days before the decision of floating a GDR/ADR issue. The new rules make it tougher for unlisted firms to go abroad. They will have to first ? or simultaneously ? put their shares on local bourses.

 Unlisted entities that have already issued GDRs or foreign bonds will have to list in the domestic market if they report a profit in this financial year or within three years of the global issue ? whichever of the two is earlier.

 Officials said the new rules will ensure that rogue companies are stopped from raising money abroad and then defaulting. 

 Such incidents tend to lower Indian ratings abroad and give all firms a bad name, they argued.

 LML bonds

 Two-wheeler manufacturer LML has decided to raise $6 million by allotting and issuing foreign currency convertible bonds. 

 The board of directors took this decision at its meeting held on Tuesday, the Kanpur-based firm told the BSE. The bonds will mature in 2010.

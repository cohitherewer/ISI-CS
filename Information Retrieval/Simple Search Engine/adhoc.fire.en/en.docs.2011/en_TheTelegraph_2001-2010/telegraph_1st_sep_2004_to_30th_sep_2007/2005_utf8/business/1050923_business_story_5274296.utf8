 IB eyes on broker ties

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Sept. 22: Intelligence Bureau (IB) sleuths are prowling dealing rooms for politically influential stock brokers who have taken a fancy to shares of dubious value. 

 The probe has been triggered by fears that the dash for these shares ? or penny stocks as they are called ? could be an attempt to engineer a bubble outside the sensex fold.

 The IB has waded in as it feels the motive behind the small-cap spurt went beyond money. Politically active brokers, always part of the system, have aroused the bureaus suspicion. 

 The finance ministry does not sniff foul play in the blue chips, whose balance sheets are strong enough to draw overseas moneybags. A 55 per cent surge in corporate tax collections in the first half reinforces that perception.

 However, the scramble for small-cap shares, many of them duds, has left in its trail several questions about who the chasers are and whether they are doing it all for money only.

 The probe went on as the department of company affairs put out an advisory urging small investors to be guided by strong fundamentals of company they wish to deal with and not get misled by market rumours or tips. 

 Sebi has been scanning the small-cap surge for some time but the effort has been hampered by the lack of authority to get to the source of funds. A recent appellate tribunal ruling on a brokerage ban highlighted just how limited the regulators powers were.

 This time, the income tax department and the Reserve Bank are on the job. While the central bank will check foreign fund flows and bank loan diversions, the tax sleuths will peer into market intermediaries records.

 IT sleuths have been working on fund-flow traces for some time. Today, brokers in Gujarat were believed to have been raided, though the revenue department said there was no basis for drawing any conclusion on these searches.

 Income tax officials also swooped on property developers like Omaxe, in and around Delhi, but said this, too, had nothing to do with probes into the capital market.

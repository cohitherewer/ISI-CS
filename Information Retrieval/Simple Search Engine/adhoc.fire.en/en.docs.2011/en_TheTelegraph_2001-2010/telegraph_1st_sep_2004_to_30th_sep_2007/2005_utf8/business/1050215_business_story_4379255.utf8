 Gail Assam cracker project gathers steam

 S. P. S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Feb. 14: Gail (India) Ltd is optimistic about the Rs 4,000-crore Assam gas cracker project coming through as the petroleum ministry and the department of petrochemicals have both approved their feasibility studies along with the subsidy required. This will now have to be placed before the cabinet after obtaining the approval from the public sector investment board.

 A senior Gail official told The Telegraph that the project would entail a subsidy of Rs 2,000 to 3,000 crore depending on the price at which the feedstock that will be made available for the cracker. 

 Various fiscal concessions such as excise tax exemption and customs concessions for the import of equipment will have to be provided for the project.

 The petrochemicals unit, which was initially planned as part of the political package for the state under the Rajiv Gandhi accord, did not see the light of day as Reliance Industries had backed out of the project. Now, with the Congress government in power once again at the Centre, the prospects of the project being implemented have brightened. 

 Senior Gail officials said the main problem is the sub-optimal size of the plant, which cannot be increased as sufficient quantities of natural gas are not available in the Northeast. While an ideal capacity for a petrochemicals unit would have been between 0.6 to 1 million tonnes per annum, the limited availability of feedstock constrains the size of the Assam gas cracker to 0.21 million tonnes. The project, therefore, cannot avail of the economies of scale. 

 While the price of natural gas from the Oil India Ltd and ONGC fields for Assam is fixed at 60 per cent of the price for the rest of the country, it is still too high for the cracker to be viable. 

 The cracker is expected to be a dual mode one so that naphtha can be used as a feedstock as well. However, Numaligarh Refineries Ltd (NRL) and Indian Oil Corporation?s refineries in the Northeast do not want to supply the naphtha at a concessional price. It appears the government is now ready to pick up this subsidy bill.

 Gail has worked out a draft feasibility report envisaging both naphtha and natural gas as feedstock to make the project viable. Under this proposal, NRL and OIL will get a 10 per cent stake each in the project as they would be supplying the feedstock. 

 A senior official said Gail was also planning to import a new technology that would enable it to make petrochemicals from the methane content of natural gas as well.

 The technology would prove to be useful as natural gas struck in some of the new fields discovered by OIL is essentially methane, which is not considered rich enough for use as an input for producing petrochemicals. 

 OIL plans to supply this gas to NRL for use as a fuel for its captive power generation plant. This, in turn, would enable NRL to save the naphtha, which it is currently using as a fuel for generating power.

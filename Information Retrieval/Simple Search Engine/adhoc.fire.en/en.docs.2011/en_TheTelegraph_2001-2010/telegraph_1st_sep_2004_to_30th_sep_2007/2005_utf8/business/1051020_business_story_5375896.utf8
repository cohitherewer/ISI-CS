 Calcutta, Oct. 19: Emami Limited hopes to cash in on the SRK charm to boost sales of its Sona Chandi brand of chyawanprash.

 The company has roped in Shahrukh Khan to endorse the product and it expects the campaign to trigger a 33 per cent growth during the current fiscal.

 We have set a Rs 40-crore sales target for Sona Chandi chyawanprash this fiscal against Rs 30 crore last year, said Aditya V. Agarwal, director of Emami Limited.

 At present, the company occupies a market share of 18 per cent, while Dabur occupies 60 per cent of the Rs 170 crore-chayawanprash market, Agarwal said.

 We expect it to grow to 25 per cent by the end of this fiscal. Last year, we had grown by 8 per cent against an industry decline of 7 per cent. With star endorsements, we hope to overtake the market leader by targeting the youth, said Agarwal.

 The company has set aside a budget of Rs 8 crore for the ad campaign with Shahrukh Khan, who is the third brand ambassador after Sunny Deol and Sourav Ganguly, who would continue to endorse the companys products.

 Khan would feature in television and print commercials.

 Emami spends about Rs 15-25 crore on brand ambassador fees annually and about Rs 40-50 crore on advertisements.

 We are also negotiating with Shahrukh Khan to endorse two more brands of the company, he said.

 The company would also launch a summer variant of its chyawanprash brand by substituting heat-producing ingredients of its winter product with cooling ingredients like khus, chandan and rosewater.

 Govt raises growth forecast to 6.9%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: Ahead of the second round of assembly polls, the government today said it expects economic growth to be around 6.9 per cent this financial year. This is about 50-100 basis points higher than earlier forecasts by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

 The higher forecast was made on the back of an expected jump in manufacturing and services output, which could help overcome the effects of a weak monsoon-hit farm sector and the impact of tsunami killer waves on south Indias economy. A near 7 per cent GDP growth could translate into a 5.3 per cent per capita growth which, along with direct measures to tackle poverty, could see the percentage of Indians below the notional poverty line considerably reduced. 

 Estimates released by the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) showed Indias farm sector was expected to grow 1.1 per cent this fiscal year, compared with earlier forecasts of negative or flat agricultural growth. Last year, the best monsoon in a decade propelled the sector to grow by an abnormally high 9.6 per cent

 However, a higher growth projection of 8.9 per cent for the manufacturing sector, compared with 6.9 per cent in 2003-04 and a similar services sector growth of 6.0 per cent in 2004-05, against 5.8 per cent in the previous year, is expected to pump growth figures again this year. India grew at an average of 6 per cent in the last 14 years. 

 Electricity, gas and the water supply sectors are likely to post higher growth rate at 6.3 per cent this fiscal compared with 3.7 per cent in the previous fiscal.

 Finance ministry economists claimed that strong manufacturing growth combined with services sector growth would make up for ?the weakness displayed in farm sector growth ... after all these two sectors account for far more output compared with the farm sector.?

 The RBI had, however, lowered its growth forecast to 6-6.5 per cent from an earlier pre-monsoon forecast of 6.5-7 per cent, building in a flat to negative growth rate in farming. 

 Similarly, Icra, the rating agency, had forecast a lower GDP growth at 6.3 per cent. It had forecast a manufacturing growth of 7.6 per cent and 8.8 per cent services sector growth combined with a 1 per cent negative growth.

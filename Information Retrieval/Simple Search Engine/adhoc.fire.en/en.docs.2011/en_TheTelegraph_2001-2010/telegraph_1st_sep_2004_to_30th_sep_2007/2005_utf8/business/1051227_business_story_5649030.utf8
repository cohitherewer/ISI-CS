The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Nathu-La link

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 26: The long-awaited border trade between India and China through Nathu-La might start by March 2006.

 Both countries are ready to start the trade through this mountainous route in north Sikkim, Union commerce secretary S.N. Menon said here today. 

 The two countries had agreed to start trade via the historic Silk Route during former Prime Minister A.B. Vajpayees visit to China in June 2003.

 The trade between two of Asias biggest economies is expected to add a new chapter to Sino-Indian business.

 Bengal also stands to gain in a major way if the trade picks up, as Siliguri will be the gateway to mainland India.

 Calcutta port will be the closest seaport for a good part of China, mainly Tibet.

 There would be 30 items to trade with at the beginning, Menon said on the sidelines of a meet organised by the Engineering Export Promotion Council.

 However, the volume might not be high at this point of time, he warned as the items are limited now.

 It would be a challenge for businessmen of both countries as Nathu-La is situated 14,600 feet above the sea level. The meandering road is still not developed to carry out international border trade in a big way. At present, cross-border trade between India and China is negligible.

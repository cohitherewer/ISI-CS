 Sensex scales 8500

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 20: The sensex has breached the 8500-mark in a session marked by intense volatility.

 The index has risen from 8000 to 8500 in only eight days ? a new record in the history of the recent bull run. The sensex rose from 7500 to 8000 in 30 days, while it took 28 days to reach 6500 from 6000. 

 The market barometer has risen by 866 points or 11.34 per cent in 15 sessions since August 30. The total market capitalisation on the BSE reached over Rs 22.84 lakh crore and investor wealth increased by Rs 1.07 lakh crore in the last eight trading sessions.

 The sensex opened 32 points lower at 8412.71 against the previous close of 8444.84. It fell to an intra-day low of 8376.12 but rallied to a high of 8515.50 before ending the day at a new closing peak of 8500.28, a net rise of 55.44 points or 0.66 per cent.

 The 139-point swing in the sensex was on account of heavy selling seen in many of the mid-cap and penny stocks. This was because of reports that the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is investigating the rise of some of these scrips.

 Brokers said heavy buying by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), domestic institutions and mutual funds fuelled the rally. Some of the scrips that played an important role were Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), Infosys and ICICI Bank. RIL was the top-traded stock on the BSE with 35.01 lakh shares being traded.

 Novel AirTel plan to tap rural users

 Crowd-puller

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: AirTel will organise street plays to penetrate the rural markets and promote its brand.

 The cellular service provider has hired a team of artists from the National School of Drama (NSD) for a pilot project that will start performing in rural areas from this week. They will enact a series of skits that will promote the use of a mobile phone. It will also display how to use the gadget, recharge and maintain it.

 To start with, the NSD artists will perform around the peripheral rural areas of Delhi and the national capital region. The performances will be organised both day and night at street corners and community centres.

 It is a new initiative and we hope to set a bench mark in brand building using street plays. There will not be any popular or known artist in this exercise. It is an unique experience and we will examine the response of the prospective rural customers before unleashing it across the country, said a senior Bharti Tele-Ventures executive.

 The initiative will explain the use of mobile phones in the day-to-day activities and also educate them that it is not a gadget exclusive for the urban market. It will also highlight the low-cost recharge of airtime offered by us, the executive added.

 The company is keen to penetrate the rural areas and consolidate its market share, before other private operators enter the fray. AirTel is expected to face a stiff competition from Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, which has a stronghold in the rural market.

 The urban market has been saturated and the next target is the rural market. When we were exploring the methods to reach the rural audience, we felt that it has to be something that rural folks identify themselves with. Plays have been an age-old medium of propagating an idea or a message in rural areas, the official said.

 When we launched AirTel Expression, we found that there is an immense scope for using plays to reach a niche audience.

 AirTel Expressions is a platform to promote and celebrate various forms of expressions through performing arts. It is an endeavour to showcase cutting edge works across the genres of cinema, theatre, music, dance and art and use them as vehicles of expression.

 The AirTel Expressions Festival of Performing Arts, to be presented in Delhi this year, will showcase a broad range of acts representing various aspects of contemporary performing arts.

 At the festival, contemporary artists from across the country will showcase their new productions.

 Some of the productions will address specific themes like multi-lingual performances, use new media in innovative and relevant ways and address subjects that have not been widely explored in performing arts before, said the executive.

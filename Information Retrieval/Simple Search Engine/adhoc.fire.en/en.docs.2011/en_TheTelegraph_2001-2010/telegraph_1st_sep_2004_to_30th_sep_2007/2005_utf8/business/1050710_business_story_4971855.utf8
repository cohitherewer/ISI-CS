 Microsoft to tap small units

 Ballmer: Betting big

 Seattle, July 9 (Reuters): Microsoft Corporation is making a major push this weekend to sell more software and services to companies that have less than 250 employees. The worlds largest software maker faces slower revenue growth.

 Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer will be speaking on Sunday to the 6,000-plus distributors, hardware makers, systems consultants and software developers that sell the companys software as partners, or resellers.

 The Microsoft Worldwide Partner Conference, or annual meeting for distributors, is being held in Minneapolis.

 Although Ballmer is expected to talk about some of the new capabilities of the next releases of Windows and Office, due out next year, Microsoft will also try to get its partners to promote its software as being more secure and more adaptable for small- and medium-sized businesses.

 We are making sure that we are really understanding what the product, business and technology needs are for our mid-market customers, said Doug Leland, a general manager at Microsoft.

 In an announcement on Friday, Microsoft said its small business accounting software, which will be launched by the end of this year, is able to process credit and debit card payments so that smaller companies can cut down on paperwork, cut costs and expand customers payment options.

 Microsoft also said that it would adopt a certification programme for system developers and resellers that will identify them as specialists in the small business software market. Washington-based Microsoft is beefing up its offerings as part of a broader effort to turn its small- and mid-size software business into a $10-billion business by 2010.

 For the last fiscal, Microsoft is expecting to report sales growth of about 8 percent, its slowest revenue growth rate since going public in 1986.

 Microsoft has spent more than $2.5 billion to buy Great Plains Software, a small-business software maker in Fargo, North Dakota, and Navision, a Danish software company, to build its software business for small- and mid-sized companies.

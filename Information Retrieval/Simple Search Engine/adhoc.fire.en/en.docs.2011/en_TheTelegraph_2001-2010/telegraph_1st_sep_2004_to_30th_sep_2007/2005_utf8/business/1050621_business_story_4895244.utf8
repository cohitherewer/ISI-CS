 Broking buyout build-up

 New York, June 20 (Reuters): Ameritrade Holding Corp is close to a deal exceeding $3 billion to buy TD Waterhouse in a move that would make it the nations largest online brokerage, according to reports.

 Citing executives close to the deal, the New York Times said it could be announced as early as Monday. The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the talks, said word of the deal could come in the next few days.

 The Times said the agreement means efforts by E*Trade Financial Corp to acquire rival Ameritrade have apparently been thwarted.

 But the Journal reported that Ameritrade has also has been discussing a potential combination with E*Trade. Ameritrades board is divided about what course to take, another person familiar with the situation told the Journal.

 E*Trade last month made an unsolicited bid to buy Ameritrade for more than $5.5 billion and earlier this month raised its offer, according to sources close to the situation.

 E*Trade could still pursue a hostile bid for Ameritrade should the deal with TD Waterhouse not materialise, two people familiar with the matter told the Journal.

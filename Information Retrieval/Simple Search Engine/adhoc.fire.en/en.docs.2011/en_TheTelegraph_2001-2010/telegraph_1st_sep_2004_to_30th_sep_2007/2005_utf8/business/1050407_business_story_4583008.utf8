 Ministry sets IIBI merger deadline

 Strong Bonding

 Calcutta, April 6: The Union finance ministry has set a deadline of March 31, 2006 to merge the ailing city-based financial institution ? IIBI ? with IDBI.

 Sources said the ministry has already informed the two institutions about its intention. IDBI will soon start due diligence of IIBI.

 Ministry sources said, ?The IFCI merger is yet to be worked out. So, in the meantime, we have decided to seal the fate of IIBI, the merger of which is hanging fire quite a long time. Since the government has decided not to provide any recapitalisation fund, it has become necessary to provide some lifeline to the ailing financial institution.?

 A formal announcement for the merger is likely to come soon. ?The ministry was waiting for the formal approval from the Reserve Bank of India on the merger of IDBI Bank with IDBI,? sources said.

 The merger of IDBI Bank with IDBI has become effective from April 1. Following this merger, IDBI becomes a financial powerhouse with an asset base of over Rs 80,000 crore. The Reserve Bank today gave its seal of approval for amalgamation of the banking subsidiary with IDBI, creating a financial powerhouse with an asset base of over Rs 80,000 crore. 

 The ministry does not apprehend any problem for IDBI taking over IIBI, officials said. ?IIBI?s balancesheet and its staff can be easily absorbed by IDBI,? officials said. 

 The city-based IIBI was initially set up as the Industrial Reconstruction Bank of India (IRBI) with its primary objective being to help revive sick industrial enterprises. However, due to its limited mandate, the operations of the financial institution itself turned unviable with a huge pile of non-performing assets (NPAs) becoming a drag on its financials. 

 The IIBI management?s effort to turn around the institution by aggressively trying to recover NPAs has only resulted in minor improvements, but not enough to make it sustainable. 

 At one point during the process of drawing up a restructuring proposal for the institution, IIBI had asked the government for a recapitalisation assistance of Rs 500 crore to make it stand on its feet once again. 

 The proposal was quickly turned down with the government making it clear that merger with another institution was the only alternative.

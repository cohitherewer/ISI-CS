The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Final call for telecom officers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 29: The Union cabinet today asked the group A Indian Telecom Service officers to either get absorbed in Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL), where they are currently on deputation, or join the department of telecommunications (DoT).

 The officers have, however, rejected the proposal. Their period of deemed deputation ends on Friday. The government has set a deadline of October 15, by which time around 3000 officers will have to choose their future. The officers belong to Indian Telecom Service, P amp;T Accounts and Finance Service and other services (civil, electrical, telecom factory, architecture).

 Directing the DoT to take all steps to ensure that services are not affected, the cabinet has approved a contingency plan in case a sufficient number of officers do not join BSNL and MTNL. 

 The contingency plan includes availing of the expertise of middle-level Group B officers to look after operations, seeking the services (on contract) of retired officers, taking help from vendors to manage exchanges, availing of the services of officers from postal service, railways and if need be, to take the assistance of the armed forces to assist in the maintenance of telecom services.

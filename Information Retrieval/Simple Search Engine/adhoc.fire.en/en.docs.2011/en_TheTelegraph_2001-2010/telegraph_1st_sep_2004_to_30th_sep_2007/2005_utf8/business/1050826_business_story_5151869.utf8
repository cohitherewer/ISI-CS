The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Rajarhat to house AllBank headquarters

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Singh: Going places

 Calcutta, Aug. 24: Allahabad Bank is planning to shift its head office from the busy Netaji Subhas Road to the eastern fringes of the city at Rajarhat.

 The bank had approached the Bengal government for a piece of land at Rajarhat for setting up an office with all the modern facilities. The government has allotted three acres to the bank.

 We have just received the sanction letter from the state government, chairman and managing director . N. Singh said

 According to rates in Rajarhat, the bank expects to shell out Rs 4 crore for the three-acre plot.

 Allahabad Bank has shifted its headquarters from 14, India Exchange Place to 2, NS Road in 1977. The total area of the office is 45,000 square feet and the bank pays a rent of Rs 2.2 lakh every month for the building.

 The building, which houses our head office at 2, Netaji Subhas Road, is a rented place. It belongs to the Raja of Burdwan. As we expand, we will need more space. Moreover, we wont have to pay the rent. The new building will become an asset to the bank, Singh said.

 Once the plot is bought, the bank will take a year to prepare the design and start the actual work. Officials, however, said the bank will shift its office after the infrastructure in the Rajarhat area improves.

 Almost seven years ago, Harbhajan Singh, the then chairman and managing director of the bank, had planned to buy out the corporate office of Jessop amp; Co on NS Road. But the deal had fallen through due to some legal wrangles and differences over price.

 Singh added that the banks board has recently approved core banking solutions at its 900 urban and semi-urban branches in one go. The bank has 1,900 branches in all.

 Singh said, The bank has kept a Rs 80,000-crore business target in the current financial year. We are on the right track and hope to achieve it.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 19: HCL Infosystems (HCL Insys) has clocked revenues of $1 billion in the first nine months of 2004-05.

 Buoyed by the results, the company aims to attract more retail customers by increasing the liquidity of its shares. It will sub-divide its share of Rs 10 each into five units of Rs 2 each.

 The board today recommended the sub-division of the company?s equity. This is subject to the approval of the shareholders through a postal ballot.

 The board has also declared a third quarterly interim dividend of Rs 7 per share (70 per cent on a face value of Rs 10).

 Chairman and CEO Ajai Chowdhry said, ?The consumer market has been a major growth area during the quarter. The consumers bought PCs for education, employment and entertainment purposes. The story was same in rural areas.?

 ?Our leadership position in the enterprise and consumer segments is a result of our continued focus in technology and enhancing service offers to consumers. Our strategy of taking IT to the masses by exploring new territories has also contributed to our growth,? said Chowdhry.

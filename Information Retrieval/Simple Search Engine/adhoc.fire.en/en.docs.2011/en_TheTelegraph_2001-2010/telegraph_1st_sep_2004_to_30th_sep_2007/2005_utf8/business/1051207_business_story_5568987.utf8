 Debt alarm in rating comfort

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 GAZING AT FUTURE

 Mumbai, Dec. 6: Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P) today affirmed its BB+ long-term and B short-term sovereign ratings with a stable outlook for India. It is, however, concerned about the fiscal deficit and said the countrys debts were rising too fast for comfort.

 The international rating agency said if the government can successfully implement the Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, there might be an improvement in the ratings outlook. If, on the other hand, the countrys debt continues on its present trajectory, the governments ratings would come under pressure.

 According to S amp;P, the countrys ratings, one notch below investment grade, balanced its strong external position and growth prospects with its weak fiscal profile and pressing development needs.

 Indias average annual growth of 6.5 per cent over the past five years is higher than any other major economy except Chinas, said credit analyst Ping Chew.

 While growth has been fuelled by steady economic reforms since 1991, India is likely to maintain, or even exceed, this pace over the medium term, Ping added. This, in turn, will allow the country to alleviate some of its pressing poverty and infrastructure needs. 

 However, India has the lowest per-capita GDP ($710 in 2005) of any country in the BB category or above. The percentage of people living on $1 a day can be compared with only a handful of nations in the B category, said S amp;P.

 The country is facing problems on the fiscal front. Chew said while the problem was acute, the implementation of a value-added tax by many states and general tax revenue buoyancy have allowed some consolidation in the past two years.

 However, despite the positive development, there are predictions the deficit will rise to 8.7 per cent of GDP in 2005-2006. This includes government transfers to state-owned oil companies to compensate in part for their public fuel subsidies.

 S amp;P said the gross general government debt and guarantees to GDP have risen to 101 per cent in 2005 from 87 per cent in 2000.

 On the other hand, the countrys external indicators are strong, notwithstanding its recent move into a current account deficit. By 2005 end, international reserves are projected to cover the countrys gross external financing requirement almost four times, S amp;P added.

 We will be watching the design and implementation of the Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, said Chew. He added that this legislation of the Centre is intended to extend a social safety net for the rural poor and address some of the infrastructure needs.

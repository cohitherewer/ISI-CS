 Ideal Villas

 Adjacent to New Town, Rajarhat 

 and Aquatica

 This luxurious Spanish countryside-style 

 estate spread across 10.5-acres, about 3 km from Nicco Park, 

 will house 125 designer mini-villas created by Hafeez Contractor.

 Among the first theme-based properties 

 coming up close to the government?s showpiece township, 

 this idyllic offering from the Ideal Group will have three 

 different categories of units. 

 Villa Miranda (18 four-bedroomed 

 villas, 3,570 sq ft each), Villa Leon (50 three-bedroomed 

 villas, 2,890 sq ft each) and Villa Pedro (57 two-bedroomed 

 villas, 2,530 sq ft each) will complete the eclectic spread.

 Club Valencia, a sprawling lifestyle 

 club for residents, will be located at the heart of the 

 estate, designed by Contractor along with city-based architects 

 Sanon Sen Associates.

 With a swimming pool, table tennis 

 and pool rooms, health spa (with gymnasium, steam and jacuzzi), 

 indoor games like carom and cards and badminton and squash 

 courts, it hopes to become the nerve-centre of the property. 

 There will also be a children?s play area. A small cafeteria 

 and yoga and meditation rooms complete the club facilities, 

 while a party hall, with attached kitchen, opens on to a 

 lawn.

 The ground floors of the villas 

 are built with a high ceiling ? 12 ft 3 inches instead of 

 the usual 10 ft ? to exude a sense of spaciousness and recreate 

 the ?aristocratic ambience of the graceful homes of yesteryears?.

 Site Concepts International Pte 

 Ltd of Singapore, specialist in streetscapes and masterplanning 

 of theme parks, has been roped in as landscape architect. 

 While there will be walking/jogging paths, and a landscaped 

 central park will add to the greenery, according to developers 

 and marketing agents Pioneer Properties.

 STATUS: To be ready by June 

 2006

 PRICE: Rs 45-60 lakh

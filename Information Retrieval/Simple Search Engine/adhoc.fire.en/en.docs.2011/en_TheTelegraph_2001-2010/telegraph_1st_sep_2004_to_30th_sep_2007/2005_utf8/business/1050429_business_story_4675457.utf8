 Anil keeps the pot boiling

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 28: A day after the Reliance boardroom spat, vice-chairman Anil Ambani stepped up the ante by blaming ?poor corporate governance? for the erosion in value of group shares. 

 The divide among the brothers on ?ownership issues? has clearly depressed the valuation of the shares of the Reliance group companies even though their annual and quarterly performances have been exemplary.

 ?What do we say? We cannot react to every statement that he (Anil ) makes,? officials at Reliance Industries said. 

 Ironically, the shares of Reliance Energy ? the company that Anil controls ? was the one that was mauled on the markets today. The stock surrendered Rs 9.60 at Rs 484.80. 

 ?Investors perceive that any long power struggle will be more detrimental to REL than any other company in the group,? said a fund manager of a leading mutual fund. REL has laid out ambitious plans to reap the benefits of the power reforms and it should be totally focussed with an assured channel of funds. 

 Even as REL shed value, the Reliance Industries? stock gained Rs 3.55 to Rs 542.65. It was the top-traded scrip with a turnover of Rs 156.04 crore. Reliance Capital, another Anil bastion, fell 5.22 per cent, from Rs177.05 to Rs 167.80. IPCL closed higher at Rs 166.45.

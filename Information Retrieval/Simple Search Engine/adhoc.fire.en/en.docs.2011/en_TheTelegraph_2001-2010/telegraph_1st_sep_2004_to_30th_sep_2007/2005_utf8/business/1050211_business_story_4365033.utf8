 New Delhi, Feb. 10: After Manmohan Singh set the agenda for the UPA government, it was the turn of finance minister P. Chidamabaram to articulate its determination to push ahead with the process of economic reforms.

 With just 18 days to go before he presents Budget 2005, Chidambaram urged the government?s allies like the Left and the Opposition to ?set aside all sterile political controversies.?

 Most of the controversies have plagued the UPA government since it came to power last May and has severely hamstrung its ability to push ahead with the third phase of reforms in the unpopular areas of labour reforms, divestment, subsidy cuts and fiscal rectitude. 

 Chidambaram set a short five-point action plan before the country that would enable it to become the driver of the global economy in the 21st century. 

 First, India needed to keep its economy open and ?continue on the same path as it did in 1991?. The Congress government had initiated the process of economic liberalisation in 1991.

 Second, it was important for India to become a ?fiscally prudent and responsible? country, he said. He indicated that the budget would give top priority to paring fiscal and revenue deficits in 2005-06 as mandated in the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act.

 Speaking at the platinum jubilee annual general meeting of Indian chapter of International Chamber of Commerce, Chidambaram said India must promote investment in sectors like irrigation, agriculture and infrastructure. The minister said India Inc needs to increase its competitiveness and identify areas where the country has a competitive advantage.

 Referring to the recent Central Statistical Organisation estimate, he said, quot;To our satisfaction, the GDP growth has been estimated at 6.9 per cent for 2004-05.? This was on the back of a high 8.5 per cent growth of 2003-04.

 The Indian economy is resilient so as to post such a high growth even after an erratic monsoon, high oil prices and adverse impacts of tsunami, he said referring to the robust manufacturing growth of 8.7 per cent and certain services growing by 11.1 per cent.

 Responding to a demand from ICCs outgoing president Sudhir Jalan, Chidambaram promised a good budget, saying ?I hope I will have many friends after 18 days (budget day of February 28)?.

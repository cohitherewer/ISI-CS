 Calcutta, April 9: Industry bodies have teamed up to educate sectors like petrochemicals, ceramics and pharmaceuticals on ways to combat the dumping menace.

 The directorate general of anti-dumping and allied duties (DGAD) has outlined the measures that the sectors can take to initiate anti-dumping proceedings, including legal action against the country resorting to such practice.

 Dumping occurs when goods are exported by a country to another at a price lower than the normal value. Anti-dumping measures are necessary to rectify the situation. It is an instrument to ensure fair trade and is not a protection measure for the domestic industry.

 Countries that resort to dumping in India are China, Taiwan, Indonesia, Korea, Russia and the EU.

 On the other hand, the EU, Canada, the US and South Africa account for almost 60 per cent of the 101 anti-dumping cases initiated till date against Indian exports.

 ?Seventy eight anti-dumping applications have been filed by the chemicals industry and 30 bu pharmaceutical companies. Fibres/yarn, steel and consumer goods are also facing dumping problems,? said A. K. Choudhury, director in the commerce ministry.

 Bokaro brings bounty 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dehradun Aug. 14: ONGC has struck coal bed methane (CBM) in Bokaro, chairman Subir Raha announced today. 

 He said the successful drilling of the well was completed on August 8 in a 95 sq km block. Seven coal seams have been identified for testing the well that was drilled to a depth of 1067 metres. The resources potential of the block has been put at 45.03 billion cubic metres on the basis of seismic surveys. 

 With 80 per cent stake in the block, ONGC handles all operations. The remaining 20 per cent stake lies with Indian Oil Corporation.

 The ONGC discovery comes close on the heels of a major CBM discovery claimed by Reliance Industries in Madhya Pradesh. CBM is usually used as a substitute for natural gas. 

 Earlier, ONGC had drilled an exploratory well, BK-1, in the same block in Bokaro where six coal seams were identified for testing. Raha said three wells in the Geleki field in Assam, currently under test drilling, have significant growth potential. 

 Similarly, seven wells, drilled in the Cambay basin, have a hydrocarbon deposit of 35 sq km with an in-place hydrocarbon volume of 10 million tonnes. ONGC had made three gas discoveries in the Krsihna Godavari basin earlier this year, which are expected to go on stream by the end of 2006.

 Kazakh bid

 ONGC along with steel tycoon L.N. Mittal has put in a bid for acquiring Petrokazakhstan in Kazakhstan. The oil producer aims to capitalise on the steel giants goodwill in Kazakhstan to bag big deals like Petrokazakhstan, ONGC officials said.

 ONGC and the Mittal group have floated two joint venture firms on July 23 to target oil and gas opportunities in the central Asian countries and Africa.

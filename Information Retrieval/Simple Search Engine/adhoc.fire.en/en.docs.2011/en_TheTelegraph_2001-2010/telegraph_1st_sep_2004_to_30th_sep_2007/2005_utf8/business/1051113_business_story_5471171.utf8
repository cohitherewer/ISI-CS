 Calcutta, Nov. 12: National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard) will give the Central government Rs 15,000 crore for funding small and marginal farmers. 

 The talks between the bank and the government are in an advanced stage.Talking to reporters on the sidelines of the BanCon 2005, Ranjana Kumar, chairperson, Nabard, said, ?This is for the first time that the government has sought a loan from the bank for small and marginal farmers. The loan is aimed at increasing the refinance limit from 30 per cent at present to 50 per cent in future.? 

 The agricultural sector holds the centrestage in the national policy of the ruling UPA government. According to Nabard, small farmers are those who hold 5 acres of cultivable land and marginal farmers are those who have 2.5 acres. Nabard will route this fund through regional rural banks and co-operative banks. 

 However, Kumar was not forthcoming on the rate of interest on this loan. It is estimated that the farmers will be able to access the fund at a rate less than 9 per cent. 

 Speaking on micro-finance and rural development, Kumar said a total micro-finance fund of Rs 200 crore would contribute to the equities of the micro-finance institutes (MFIs). The equity financing will, however, depend upon the concerned MFI?s rating. 

 She added, ?Nabard will also provide 75 per cent of the funds required to rate a particular MFI.? There are 800 MFIs in the country and some of them are doing extremely well. ?At present, about 10 per cent of the MFIs do 80 per cent of the total micro-financing,? Kumar pointed out. ?Self-help groups are also an important link in the entire chain of micro-financing. There are 16.18 lakh such groups as on March 31, 2005. And their cumulative disbursement stands at Rs 7,567 crore,? she added. 

 Nabard is also mulling a funding scheme for the tea industry, after tasting success in the sugar industry. 

 ?A team of senior Nabard officials will be in the city by the month-end to review the tea sector. Tea is a part of agriculture and the industry has a lot of potential. However, its problem areas have to be gauged and the best remedial measures have to be handed out,? Kumar said.

 Orissa readies for Posco D-day

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, June 21: Ignoring opposition to the establishment of Posco steel plant, the Orissa government is all set to sign a memorandum of understanding tomorrow evening with Pohang Steel Company for setting up a 12-million tonne steel plant in the state. The opposing parties had demanded a debate on certain controversial clauses in the proposal.

 With less than 24 hours to go for the MoU, the state is rolling out a red carpet welcome to the 36-member delegation from the South Korean steel giant and other dignitaries, including South Korean ambassador Jung Il Choi.

 The conference hall on the third floor of the state secretariat is being given a facelift for the mega event, which promises to bring in the biggest ever FDI of Rs 52,000 crore into the country.

 The Posco project involves building a 12-million-tonne steel plant, a 30-million-tonne iron ore mine, a mill for making hot-rolled coil and a sea port. The steel plant is likely to start production by 2009. The state has so far signed MoU with 36 mineral-based industries.

 The Posco team will be headed by chairman Ku Taek Lee. Other members include heads of architecture, steel-making, refractory, electrification and other departments.

 The CMs office along with the departments of steel and mines, forest and environment, law and the chief secretarys office are working overnight to give a final shape to the document. The steel and mines department and Ipicol are preparing the draft. Chief minister Naveen Patnaik is learnt to have issued a diktat to all departments concerned to prepare a flawless draft. Chatterjee is overseeing the drafting of the document.

 The MoU allows Posco to swap 30 per cent of the 600-million-tonne iron ore allotted to it. The steel major has reduced its iron ore linkage demand from 1 billion tonne and also agreed to no net export of ore. Earlier, it had insisted on exporting a small portion of high-grade ore to Brazil.

 But the state government had insisted that the company should first import low-grade ore from Brazil. Only then Posco will be allowed to export equal quantity ore, said steel and mines minister Padmanabh Behera.

 He said the company would require 4,000 acres for the plant and 1,500 acres for the township at Paradip. Fifty per cent of the produce would be sold in the domestic market and the rest would be exported.

 The state is expected to earn a revenue of Rs 700-800 crore per annum from this. The project would directly employ 13,000 people and provide indirect jobs to another 35,000. 

 Once the company starts manufacturing, the government would be able to offset a debt burden of Rs 33,000 crore from the revenue generated by this project.

 IA pitches for bigger air corridor

 For More wings

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: Indian Airlines, which was barred by the cabinet from flying beyond the Gulf and Southeast Asia, is making a renewed pitch to fly to the UK and the US, among other destinations. 

 The airline feels it should be allowed to compete in sectors where Air-India is not flying or in sectors where the fight is with another airline and its flights will help stop passengers from flying competing foreign airlines.

 Top ministry sources said IA will be holding a series of meetings with the ministry over the next few days. 

 The bid by the state-run carrier, which has the single largest fleet in the country, to fly beyond the neighbourhood is being opposed by both its sister airline Air-India, which fears it will be undercut, and by private airlines, which fears the airline?s size. 

 Meanwhile, private airlines rushed to hand in their wish list for foreign routes, the deadline for which ended today.

 Jet Airways officials remained tightlipped, but civil aviation ministry sources said the airline wanted to fly to Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, the US and London, among other destinations. 

 Air Sahara also wants to compete on similar routes in addition to Mauritius. Both the private airlines want to fly to Southeast Asia from this summer and destinations to the West in the winter.

 Air-India wanted to add Washington, San Francisco and Houston to a huge list of sectors where it has flying rights. The national carrier also wants to increase the number of flights to London and Chicago. Unused sectors where A-I holds rights and wants to fly in the near future include Sydney, Toronto, Mauritius, Rome and Amsterdam. 

 All airlines have their eyes on the lucrative London sector, especially as British airlines have been allowed 40 fresh flights. The extremely aggressive Virgin Airways has already decided to fly seven flights a week between Delhi and London from next month and three flights between Mumbai and London from March-end.

 British Airways, the biggest player on the route, marks up its highest profit per flight from India.

 The Union cabinet had allowed private domestic airlines ? Jet and Sahara ? to fly to all foreign destinations except the Gulf states at a meeting held in December. 

 The cabinet had ruled that IA will not be given the freedom immediately, but civil aviation minister Praful Patel had said once the airline comes up with a viable fleet plan, which gives it the muscle to fly long range, it could fly to the US and Europe.

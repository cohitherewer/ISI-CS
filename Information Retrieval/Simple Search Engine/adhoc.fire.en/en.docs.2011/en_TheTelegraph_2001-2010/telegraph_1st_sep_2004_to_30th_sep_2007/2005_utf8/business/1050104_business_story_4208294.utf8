 Chip makers to float talent pool

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 3: The Indian Semiconductor Association (ISA), the apex body for the chip design industry, has drawn up a blueprint to create a talent pool of 10,000 professionals every year to wipe out the huge demand-supply gap for skilled labour in the country.

 The ISA was set up in November last year to act as a channel for the very large scale integration (VLSI) technology or the chip design industry in a manner similar to the role played by Nasscom for the software services sector.

 The chip design industry in the country is worth $1 billion and is expected to see major investments in the next few years. 

 ?Currently, there are around 7,000 to 8,000 professionals working in the design industry and there is a requirement for a few thousands every year,? says Biswadip Mitra, president of the VLSI Society of India (VSI) and managing director of Texas Instruments.

 Speaking on plans to ramp up trained manpower, Mitra says, ?We plan to tap 200 universities and technical institutes in the country to create a pool of 2,000 trainers for the industry. The idea is to go beyond elite institutions and tap the potential in smaller towns and cities. Training will be imparted through both classrooms and distance learning programmes.?

 The massive exercise is expected to generate a pool of 10,000 trained and industry-ready professionals every year from 2010. Globally, VLSI is a $150-billion industry.

 The ISA has already structured a master?s programme for signal processing and embedded software in association with the VSI. The programme will be distributed to 1,000 institutes across the country, of which 200 will be selected for the final course.

 ?We want to make India the hub of the VLSI technology and cater to all aspects like design, testing, assembly, packaging and finally manufacturing,? said Pradip Dutta, president and managing director of Synopsys, an EDA company.

 It is important to note that though there are around 80 companies in the VLSI area, India does not have a single chip manufacturing facility.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Another jute mill out of Lodha hand

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 29: In yet another boardroom battle victory against Rajendra Singh Lodha, the Birla family today gained control over MP Birla outfit Rameshwara Jute Mills. Yesterday, the Birlas established their hold over Jute Investment Company.

 Rameshwara Jute Mills, which has about Rs 700 crore worth of iron ore reserves in Jharkhand, was managed by the MP Birla group for more than 45 years. At present, the company is under the control of Lodha, who is fighting a bitter legal battle for the succession of the MP Birla assets. Late M.P. Birla was once a director of the company as well.

 At the annual general meeting held today at Birla Building in Calcutta, seven individuals from the companies belonging to the Birla family were elected to the 10-member board.

 Rameshwara Jute Mills ? a Calcutta Stock Exchange listed company ? also has 83,100 shares of Century Enka, the BK Birla group firm.

 The MP Birla group holds a 31.26 per cent stake in the company, while the BK, GP and SK Birla groups hold 59 per cent share on a consolidated basis.

 We were confident about our victory, a Birla family confidant said.

 The importance of todays AGM is evident as all who were voted in as directors to the RJML board stayed close to the venue so that they could reach in time on a day when a strike was on.

 A few public shareholders of the company, however, voted against the resolutions moved by the Birla clan.

 The elected nominees from the Birla clan are Shyam Sunder Jajodia, Dipak Shantilal Mehta, J.P. Agrawal, Kashi Prasad Chaudhary, Hukam Chand Daga, S.K. Parik and R.P. Pansari.

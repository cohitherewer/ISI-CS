 Fabia

New Delhi, Jan 7: The two much-awaited new offerings from the Czech auto major Skoda ? Fabia and Octavia II ? are expected to hit the Indian roads by early next fiscal. 

 Speaking to The Telegraph, Shashank Vaid, marketing head of Skoda Auto India, said Octavia II, is expected to be launched in the second half of the calendar year. Vaid did not specify the time for the launch of Fabia but company sources said both the launches are expected in the first part of the next fiscal. 

 Vaid refused to disclose the price tag of the two cars, but said, ?Octavia II, will be on the higher A 5 platform, as against the existing Octavia, which is on the A4 platform. In effect, it will be a bigger car than the present Octavia and will consequently be priced higher.? 

 At present, Octavia I range of cars include the variants of Laurin amp; Klement, Elegance, and Rider. While the first two are priced around Rs 14 and Rs 13 lakh respectively, Rider is priced around Rs 11 Lakh. 

 Fabia is a C segment car, that is to say a notch below the Octavia range . The expected price tag is less than Rs 10 lakh for Fabia. 

 So far, the most expensive car from the Skoda stable to have hit Indian roads is the Skoda Superb , which is priced at Rs 23.5 lakh. Skoda has also launched a turbo petrol car, the Skoda RS, priced at around Rs 13 lakh. 

 Skoda, which started selling cars in India in November 2001, has set a target of selling 13,200 units this year. Since its Indian operation began, Skoda has so far sold 16,500 cars in the country. Skoda expects a quantum jump in sales this year.

 Octavia

The company, so far, has invested more than Rs 257.6 crore ($56 million) at its facility located in Aurangabad, which employs 300 people and can manufacture 15,000 units annually.

 The automobile sector has been one of the major beneficiaries of the countrys economic growth, which is forecast to grow at around 7 per cent in the current financial year 

 The premium car segment estimated at about 40,000 units rose 6 per cent in the previous fiscal and 4 per cent in the year before that. 

 Analysts, however, said overall car sales should report a year-to-year 10 per cent growth this decade.

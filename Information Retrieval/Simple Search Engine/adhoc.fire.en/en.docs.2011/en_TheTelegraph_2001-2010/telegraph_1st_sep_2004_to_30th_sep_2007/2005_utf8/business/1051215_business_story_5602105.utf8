The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Lehman does well for itself

 JENNY ANDERSON

 New York, Dec. 14: Lehman 

 Brothers, the investment bank taken for dead by many in 

 1998, furthered its remarkable run Tuesday as it reported 

 a 41 per cent rise in fourth-quarter earnings. The results 

 were driven by gains in merger and acquisition advice, bond 

 trading and stock and bond sales.

 The firm earned $823 million, 

 or $2.76 a share, compared with $585 million, or $1.96 a 

 share, in the quarter a year ago. Seventeen analysts surveyed 

 by Thomson Financial had expected $2.64 a share. Revenue 

 increased 28 per cent, to $3.7 billion, although it fell 

 4 per cent from the previous quarter.

 In terms of investment banking, 

 in terms of capital markets, in terms of investment management, 

 really everything was very positive, said Guy Moszkowski, 

 a securities industry analyst with Merrill Lynch. Their 

 outlook statement was also quite positive: Their backlogs 

 are up compared to where they were last year and they expect 

 to be able to continue to pick up market share.

 Every business unit produced year-on-year 

 growth, while a few segments slowed sequentially. Investment 

 banking revenue rose 34 per cent over the quarter a year 

 ago, to $817 million; capital markets revenue soared 30 

 per cent, to $2.4 billion; and investment management rose 

 13 per cent, to $509 million. Expenses remained in line, 

 with compensation and net benefits as a percentage of net 

 revenue totalling 48.7 per cent for the quarter, compared 

 with 48.6 per cent a year ago.

 Profitability was strong, with 

 a pretax margin of 33 per cent for the full year of 2005, 

 compared with 30.4 percent in 2004. The bloom may be wearing 

 off, however, as the consensus estimate for Lehmans 

 2006 earnings remains $10.81, while the firm earned $10.87 

 for 2005.

 Many factors contribute to that 

 conservative estimate. The mortgage origination business, 

 in which retail mortgages are packaged and resold, could 

 slow because of slower growth in the retail mortgage market. 

 Lehman has made a significant bet on that business. Interest 

 rates continue to rise, which makes it more challenging 

 for banks to make money in bond trading, a major growth 

 area.

 Unlike many of its main competitors, 

 Lehman has not made a big bet on energy and commodities, 

 and executives say it does not intend to change that path. 

 Countering that pessimism is David Goldfarb, Lehmans 

 chief administrative officer, who sees growth in the global 

 economy, growth in global capital markets and Lehmans 

 ability to increase market share. Lehmans backlog 

 of deals is impressive. Compared with the end of 2004, when 

 the bank had $74 billion in pending mergers and acquisitions, 

 it now has $236 billion. 

 It has $51 billion in debt deals 

 at the end of 2005, compared with $37 billion at the end 

 of 2004, and $19 billion in equity deals, compared with 

 $13 billion in 2004.

 Lehman also continues to be one 

 of the fastest-growing banks in terms of hiring, doubling 

 its ranks in the last five years.

 We have more capacity to 

 add more value to our expanding client base, Goldfarb 

 said. Lehman added 3,340 employees in 2005, increasing the 

 size of its employee base by 17 percent.

 In addition, Lehman has moved 

 aggressively, like most of its peers, to expand internationally. 

 More than 50 percent of revenue came from Asia and Europe, 

 where mortgage markets may move in a different direction 

 than in the United States. quot;The U.S. origination business 

 may be slowing while it is growing in other markets, quot; 

 Moszkowski, the Merrill Lynch analyst, noted.

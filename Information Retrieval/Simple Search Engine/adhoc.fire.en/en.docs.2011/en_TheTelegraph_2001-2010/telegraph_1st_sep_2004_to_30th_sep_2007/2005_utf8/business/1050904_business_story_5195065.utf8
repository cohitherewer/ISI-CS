 Calcutta, Sept. 3: The Union commerce ministry has urged the Council for Leather Exports (CLE) ? the apex body of leather goods exporters ? to step up exports in the next three years so that the $5.2-billion target is reached by 2008. 

 Originally the target was set for 2019.

 CLE chairman Rafeeque Ahmed said on Friday that the steep target set by the ministry could be achieved by setting a higher compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15 per cent. This is possible if we look at an export growth of over 25 per cent, Ahmed said. 

 Last year, the country exported $2.4 billion worth of leather and leather goods. The target for the current year has been set at $2.85 billion.

 Ahmed, however, is hopeful that with foreign direct investment starting to flow into the sector, exports of leather products will increase in the coming years. He also said that the dominance of China in the international leather market might get a beating due to the increasing labour costs in that country. 

 Ahmed mentioned that many American and Tiwanese footwear and leather goods manufacturers are looking at India. Some FDI proposals, now at discussion stage, are likely to mature soon, he said.

 The eastern region, which specialises in small leather products, logged Rs 1,800-crore exports in 2004-05. With the opening of the leather complex at Bantala near Calcutta, the largest of its kind in the world, the industry in Bengal will get a boost as it would provide the marketing opportunity to local manufacturers to reach out to the global market. 

 The three-day fair, organised by the Indian Leather Product Association (ILPA), opened today showcasing an wide array of leather products such as hand bags, wallets, portfolios, rucksacks, briefcases, belts, industrial gloves finished leather, lining leather and components and accessories for leather goods.

 The Indian Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO), a collaborator of the fair, has arranged for the visit of overseas buyers from Australia, Bangladesh, Japan, Thailand, Italy, South Africa, Russia, Germany, Czech Republic, Vietnam and Brazil. Besides, buying agents for a number of international chains are also expected to visit the annual fair. 

 Bantala complex

 The land for the proposed leather goods part complex within the 50-acre premises of the Bantala Leather Complex is likely to be handed over to ILPA Investment Fund ? a special purpose vehicle ? by the end of this year, said Anup Kumar Chatterjee, CLEs regional chairman (eastern region). 

 Chatterjee added that 53 exporters of leather products including a few from Chennai, Kanpur and Delhi have proposed to put their factories in the proposed complex for which the Union government has sanctioned Rs 5 crore.

 The Planning Commission, which had taken active interest in the project, has proposed to set up also a design complex, a common facility centre and a training institute for workers there.

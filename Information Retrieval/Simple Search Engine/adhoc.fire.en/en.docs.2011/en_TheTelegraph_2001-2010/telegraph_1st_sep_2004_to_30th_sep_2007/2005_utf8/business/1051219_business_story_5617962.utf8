 AirTel ties up with Bird in call bonanza

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 CALL FOR ALL

 New Delhi, Dec. 18: A handset for less than Rs 1,500 that includes free talktime worth Rs 600. Mobile telephones cant get cheaper.

 AirTel, a leading GSM operator, has tied up with Bird, the Chinese handset maker, to launch mobile phones that will cost Rs 1,399 and will come with a free talktime of Rs 100 per month for six months. The AirTel move comes close on the heels of the two CDMA (code division multiple access) operators, Tata Indicom and Reliance Infocomm, introducing their cheap, airtime-bundled handsets. 

 AirTel claims its handsets would cost the least in the GSM segment that has operators like Hutch and Idea and would target at the largely untapped rural market. 

 The unique feature of bundling free talktime with the handset is that the phone will not allow the AirTel user to use the services of another operator for a period of eight months. Tata Indicom and Reliance Infocomm, the first movers to offer free airtime on new handsets, also restrict the users from going to other service providers. For example, Reliance handsets that come with free talktime wont work on any other operators network and hence the users of these phones are permanently tied with Reliance Infocomm.

 Airtel has followed the model in a truncated form. The GSM service provider locks the phone and the subscriber identification module (SIM) for eight months. However, after that, the subscriber is free to use the SIM in any other phone or use the phone with any SIM after getting deactivated from Birds distributors across the country. The AirTel offer gives the subscriber free talktime of Rs 100 every month for the first six months. This is in addition to the amount of airtime the subscriber buys. The Chinese handset maker claims to have sold more than 65,000 phones under the scheme, which has been test-run in Bengal, Jharkahnd, Orissa, northeastern states and Uttar Pradesh (east and west) last month, within 24 days of its launch.

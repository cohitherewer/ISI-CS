 Two more software parks 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 4: The state government today entered into an agreement with the department of information technology to set up two more software parks at Siliguri and Haldia.

 This will take the total count of software parks in the state to five, including Calcutta, Durgapur and Kharagpur. 

 ?Both the units are expected to be operational by December this year,? state IT secretary G. D. Gautama said. ?The idea is to create IT hubs beyond Calcutta to ease the infrastructure pressure on the city and also tap the potential in these areas.?

 The state will cross the Rs 2500-crore export mark this year against Rs 1600 crore registered last year. Bengal has set a target to garner a 15 per cent share of the country?s IT revenues and 20 per cent of that of the IteS sector. A monitoring mechanism has been set up in collaboration with the department of IT and Webel to supervise the progress of the projects.

 ?Siliguri has gained additional importance as a gateway to the northeast. The beginning of trade through the Nathula Pass will further increase the economic activity in this town,? state IT minister Manabendra Mukherjee said.

 Software Technology Parks of India (STPI), an autonomous society under the department of information technology, will also set up two earth stations at Siliguri and Haldia. STPI director-general S. N. Zindal said, ?Connectivity is not an issue as the state has a total capacity of 580 mbps against 150mbps being utilised currently.?

 Mukherjee added that the state was actively considering identifying locations that would be developed specifically for the hardware industry.

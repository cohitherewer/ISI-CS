 Patel rules out air-route probe

 Patel: Sure fire

 New Delhi, May 12: Civil aviation minister Praful Patel today rejected the demand for a probe into the timing of grant of international flight rights to private airlines. 

 Patel said there was no link between the policy decision taken by the government on opening up international routes and the timing of an IPO by an airline. 

 I would like to assure the House that there is absolutely no link between the governments decision of allowing Indian scheduled carriers to operate on international routes and the initial public offer of any airline, the minister said in the Lok Sabha today.

 It is not the function of the government to keep track of the IPOs of private enterprises and, in any case, government decisions are not guided by dates of such IPOs, Patel said in a reference to the implementation of recommendations of the standing committee on transport, tourism and culture.

 There is no need for any further inquiry into this matter by an independent agency as we have been completely transparent and there is no issue that needs to be investigated, he said.

 The high-powered parliamentary committee on transport headed by CPM leader Nilotpal Basu had advised an inquiry by an independent agency into Patels decisions and timing of awarding important routes like New York, London and Singapore to private airlines Jet and Sahara. 

 The decision to allow private airlines to fly abroad was announced in December. Jet filed its IPO prospectus in early January. The ministry then asked the two national carriers to submit plans for new international flights by January 18. 

 On January 23, all airlines were told to place actual plans within two days. Routes were awarded soon afterwards. 

 First, traffic rights were awarded to Air- India and other scheduled Indian carriers for the UK on January 31 since they had to get slots at the airports there. However this date has no relevance to the IPO offer, as our enquiries reveal that the opening day of the IPO was February 18, 2005, Patel said.

 Co-op bank claim rules simplified

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 15: The Reserve Bank has simplified the process of settling the claims of deceased depositors of urban co-operative banks. It has tried to make the procedure hassle-free and fast. 

 The central bank has told urban co-operative banks that while making payment to the survivor(s)/ nominee of the deceased depositor, banks should desist from insisting on production of succession certificate, letter of administration or probate, or obtain any bond of indemnity or surety from the survivor(s)/ nominee, irrespective of the amount due to the deceased account-holder. 

 This should be done in case of deposit accounts where the depositor had utilised the nomination facility and made a valid nomination or where the account was opened with the survivorship clause.

 The RBI notification said in cases where the deceased depositor had not nominated any beneficiary, that is accounts without the survivor(s)/ nominee clause, banks should adopt a simplified procedure of repaying the legal heir of the depositor. 

 In this context, banks may, keeping in view their risk management systems, fix a minimum threshold limit for the balance in the account of deceased depositors up to which claims could be settled without insisting on production of any documentation other than a letter of indemnity, the RBI added.

 Banks were also told to settle claims in respect of deceased depositors and release payments to the survivor(s)/ nominee within a period not exceeding 15 days from the date of receipt of the claim. This is, however, subject to the production of death certificate of the deceased depositor and suitable identification of the claim to the banks satisfaction. 

 The RBI said in cases of deposit accounts where the depositor had utilised the nomination facility and made a valid nomination or where the account was opened with the survivorship clause, the bank is liable to pay the balance in the account to the survivor(s)/ nominee.

 However, the bank should exercise caution in establishing the identity of the survivor(s)/ nominee and also the death of the account-holder through appropriate documentary evidence.

 Moreover, there should be no order from the competent court restraining the bank from making the payment from the deceased depositors account.

 In case of term deposits, banks have been advised to incorporate a clause in the form for opening the account that in the event of the death of the depositor, premature termination of term deposits would be allowed. Such premature withdrawals will not attract any penal charge.

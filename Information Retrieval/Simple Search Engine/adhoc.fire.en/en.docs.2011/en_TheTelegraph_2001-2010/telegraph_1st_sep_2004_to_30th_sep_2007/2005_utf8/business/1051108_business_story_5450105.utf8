 Aviva taps 11 co-op banks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 7: Aviva Life Insurance, the joint venture between Dabur and Aviva Plc of the UK, today entered into a bancassurance alliance with 11 co-operative banks in three states in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Jammu amp; Kashmir. With this, Aviva will increase its reach to 224 locations in the country.

 This is the largest such tie-up forged by an insurance joint venture in one single go. Bancassurance is the arrangement in which banks sells insurance products as a corporate agent of an insurer. 

 According to Aviva, it has now emerged as a market leader with the largest number of bancassurance tie-ups by any private insurer in the country. The company plans to sell 6000 policies in the first year of this partnership. 

 The banks with which Aviva has partnerships include Prime Cooperative Bank in Surat, Jammu Central Cooperative Bank, Shree Warna Sahakari Bank in Kolhapur, among others. 

 Stuart Purdy, managing director of Aviva Life Insurance, said the rural and semi-urban areas in the country, where the number of people having a life insurance cover is very low, have huge potential and the joint venture was targeting these areas through bancassurance partnerships. Rural and semi-urban areas in India have immense business potential, and with these partnerships we are confident that we will be able to reach out to the length and breadth of the country, he added.

 Purdy noted that the bancassurance channel now contributes close to 65 per cent of the companys total business.

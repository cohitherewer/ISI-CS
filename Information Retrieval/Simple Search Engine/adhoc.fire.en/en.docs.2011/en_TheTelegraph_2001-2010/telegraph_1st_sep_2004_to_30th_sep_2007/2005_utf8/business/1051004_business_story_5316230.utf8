 Trai sops to boost rural service

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 3: The telecom regulator today submitted its recommendations on the growth of telecom services in rural India. 

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has proposed a basket of financial sops for firms operating in rural areas.

 It has suggested defraying part of the cost of shared infrastructure and reducing the licence fee and spectrum charges, based on the number of rural base stations they install. 

 The Trai has emphasised that this alternative approach will help network infrastructure expansion in rural areas.

 It has claimed that by implementing the scheme early, Indias rural tele-density would go up to around 15 per cent by December 2007 from less than 2 per cent now. Our optimism is based on the experience of mobile growth in urban areas, said a Trai official. Combined with an expected urban tele-density of around 43 per cent, this would take the overall density to 22.98 per cent to achieve the governments target of 250 million subscribers.

 The regulator has pointed out that since tele-density is linked with the level of development, the huge difference between rural (1.94 per cent) and urban tele-density (31.1 per cent) is not sustainable. 

 A senior Trai official said, Without focus on rural areas, growth in the telecom sector will not be possible. 

 If the present Universal Service Obligation (USO) policy continues, it is expected that India would achieve a rural tele-density of only around 3 per cent by the end of 2007, cautioned Trai. 

 To achieve a subscriber base of 250 million, the government requires an urban tele-density of 70 per cent by December 2007, which is too ambitious a target. Besides, even if the target is met, it would create a much wider and more unacceptable rural-urban divide, Trai added.

 The Trai has suggested that only network infrastructure expansion projects should get support from the USO fund. A time has come when our policies of reaching telecom to villages are looked at as Universal Service Opportunity rather than Universal Service Obligation. The time is ripe for such a changeover.

 The existing subsidised individual direct exchange lines, village public telephones, multi-access radio receiver replacement will barely achieve the rural tele-density target of 4 per cent by 2010, even after absorbing a subsidy support of about Rs 30,000 crore.

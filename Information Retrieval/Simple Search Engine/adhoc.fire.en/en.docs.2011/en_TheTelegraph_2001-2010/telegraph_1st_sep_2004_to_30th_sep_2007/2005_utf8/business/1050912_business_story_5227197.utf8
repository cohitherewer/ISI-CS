The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Easy approval in power play

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Sept. 11: The Centre is considering doing away with an in-principle approval from the Planning Commission and a Public Investment Board (PIB) clearance for power projects.

 All projects costing up to Rs 500 crore would be directly processed by the power ministry and will not require PIB approval, power ministry sources said.

 Moreover, projects with investments between Rs 500 crore and Rs 1500 crore will be cleared in eight weeks by the cabinet committee of economic affairs (CCEA).

 Sources said 40 of the 78 hydro-projects with an investment of Rs 1,500 crore and below will be completed early. Almost 75 per cent of transmission projects below Rs 1,500 crore by the Power Grid Corporation will also benefit from the fast-track clearance.

 An in-principle nod from the Planning Commission generally takes six to eight weeks. PIB proceedings take another eight to 10 weeks, sources added.

 The decision to streamline the clearance procedure will help the projects in pipeline. This will also attract further investments in this sector, said a CESC official.

 The power ministry has given a major thrust to speed up the development and reforms of the power sector. It has set up an agenda to provide power to all by 2012. 

 To meet the projected power requirement by 2012, an additional capacity addition of 100,000 MW is required in the next two Five-Year Plans. 

 A capacity of nearly 41,000 MW will be set up in the Tenth Plan and the remaining in the Eleventh Plan with a stronger focus on hydro power.

 The outlay for the power sector has been raised from Rs 45,591 crore during the Ninth Plan to Rs 143,399 crore in the Tenth Plan.

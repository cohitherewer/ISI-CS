 New Delhi, Aug. 18: Intel will continue to invest in India, even though its plans to set up a manufacturing centre in the country are under a cloud.

 ?We will continue to invest in India... The development centre is growing...We are continuing to hire and grow. It is part of our existing plan. Our presence in India is growing in terms of the number of cities and towns. So, our overall commitment to India continues to grow,? Ketan Sampat, president of Intel India, said.

 Parrying questions about the exact number of people to be hired at the companys India Development Centre in Bangalore, Sampat said: ?We don?t divulge specific numbers.?

 At present, the centre has 2,700 professionals and is engaged in design and development of solutions for all major Intel business units. Its new campus is coming up in Bangalore.

 Sampat, however, declined to comment on Intel?s plans to set up a manufacturing unit in India. IT minister Dayanidhi Maran had earlier announced that Intel would set up a $400- million assembly test manufacturing plant in India, but the company had denied having arrived at such a decision.

 The company had announced a $41-million investment in its development centre in 2003. 

 NIIT tieup

 Intel and NIIT today joined hands to introduce specialised training programmes for software developers.

 The tieup will help extend the benefits of latest Intel technologies to students and developers in India.

 The programme will use the resources of Intel Software College and offer training courses through the NIIT network. Joint programmes will be developed to help software developers maximise the performance of their applications running on Intel architectures and platforms.

 ?Our collaboration with NIIT will help Indian software developers and architects capitalise on latest technology trends and deliver new products to their customers,? said Sampat.

 The instructor-led training programmes will also provide developers access to tried-and-tested methods for optimising software performance on Intel architectures, code samples, self-help and troubleshooting tools.

 Initially, the training programme will focus on multi-core processing with labs across 10 NIIT centers at Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune. The long-term plan is to extend the programme to at least 50,000 students over the next three years.

 NIIT chairman Rajendra S Pawar, said, ?This unique technology collaboration with Intel would help NIIT prepare over 50,000 Indian IT professionals on cutting-edge Intel technologies in three years. In the next phase, we will carry this experience to China and other Asia-Pacific countries.?

 NIIT will also set up state-of-the-art training centres, where participants will be taught by instructors trained on Intels tools and technologies. After completion, the participants will receive the course materials, evaluation licences for the products used in class and resources for ongoing learning. 

 Participants who enroll in these courses can also register online on the Intel Software College website and avail of online programs to supplement classroom training.

 FM flashes bank merger alert

 New Delhi, Aug 30: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today asked state-run banks to brace for a wave of consolidation despite the Lefts warnings to the contrary.

 He said the government would support mergers and buyouts if the initiative came from the boards and employees of banks. SBI, for instance, is the largest bank. But we are not happy that it is not the largest one in Asia or the fact that it is not a global player. Thats why we are pushing for consolidation, Chidambaram said

 A proposal to merge SBIs associate banks with the main entity has been lying with the finance ministry for long. If the minister means what he says, the plan should come to fruition in this financial year. Consolidation cannot be put off for long, Chidambaram, who has long been advocating bank mergers to the consternation of Left trade unions, said at a function organised by State Bank of Patiala here today.

 The minister said he was convinced intensifying competition would force public sector banks to consolidate for survival. One of the results of this would be that their branches would turn into financial service marts. Chidambaram even spelt out as much when he urged the banks to opt to become one-stop-shop for all financial services in the way stand-alone shops have made way for retail chains which, in turn, have led to malls.

 No privatisation

 The finance minister asserted that the government does not intend to privatise state-run banks but would hold them accountable for their statements of intent. 

 We do not want to privatise public sector banks. We will give them autonomy, remove the shackles and allow them to grow and become world class. But at the end of the day, we will hold them accountable, he added.

 The accountability will be based on several counts, including performance as projected in the statement of intent. While giving them more freedom in operations, the government would ensure that its stake in PSU banks does not fall below 51 per cent, Chidambaram said.

 The government will also retain powers to appoint chairmen and executive directors, ensure banks adhere to corporate governance and deliver in the way promised in the statement of intent signed by their chiefs.

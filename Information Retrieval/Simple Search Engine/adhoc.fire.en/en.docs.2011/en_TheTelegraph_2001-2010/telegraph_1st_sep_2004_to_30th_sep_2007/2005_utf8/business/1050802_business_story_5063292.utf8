 Captains steer a lonely vessel

 Mumbai, Aug. 1: Corporate captains made their way to the plush offices today, but their foot soldiers just decided to call it a (rainy) day. 

 The resilient Mumbaikar, who has weathered bigger storms, including a couple of serial bomb blasts, was tested once again today, only to fail miserably. Most preferred to stay at home on the opening day of the week rather then venture out to office. 

 Companies headquartered in the city reported very thin attendance. Moreover, advisories from government authorities forced them to down shutters after noon. 

 Anil Ambani was at Reliance Centre, the Ballard Estate office, at sharp nine in the morning, even as most employees stayed home. Anils office is just a 10-minute drive from his Sea Wind residence in tony Cuffe Parade. Moreover, he owns utility vehicles like a black Range Rover and a Toyota Prado Land Cruiser, which can easily survive the floods. 

 Bombay House, the Tata headquarters, was practically desolate. The attendance is very thin, admitted a senior Tata official. Ravi Kant, the new managing director of Tata Motors, was in office but many of his juniors living in the suburbs were absent. 

 At Nariman Point, the scene was no different. At Maker Chambers IV, Mukesh Ambani and his cousins, the Meswanis, were holding fort. 

 At Ramon House, the headquarters of HDFC, Deepak Parekh was in. Well, the top honchos had no excuse but to be present, said an employee. All of them stay in South Mumbai which is much less affected, he added. 

 However, senior HDFC officials said, the company had ensured that staff needed to disburse loans and attend customers were around. 

 At eBay India, the internet auction site, only 15 out of 115 were present in the Lower Parel office. The two country managers ? Gautam Thakar and Rajan Mehra ? were around but their crucial workforce was not there, forcing them to declare a backup day on Saturday for those who did not attend office today. 

 Chieftains in the aviation industry, which is losing out badly as planes stand still on the tarmac, managed the show from the ground. Saroj Datta, executive director of Jet Airways, was at the Marol headquarters in the north western suburbs. 

 Jet Airways CEO Wolfgang Prock-Schauer was in office, while COO Peter Luethi was at the airport managing passengers. 

 Only the stock brokers were a happy lot with the sensex gaining about 30 points. Dealers were smart enough to shift to five star hotels close to their offices on Sunday itself. Refco Sify and Kotak Securities were among the leading brokerages that got their staff to attend this way. 

 A press conference to announce the Hindustan Times maiden offer was called off. The Gartner summit, scheduled to begin tomorrow, has been postponed. The Reserve Bank and most other banks reported thin attendance.

 At Essar House in Mahalaxmi, close to 150 of the 800 employees turned up for work. 

 Wockhardt and Sun Pharma also saw a poor turnout. 

 Swati Piramal, director of Nicholas Piramal, said its difficult to quantify the losses at this stage.

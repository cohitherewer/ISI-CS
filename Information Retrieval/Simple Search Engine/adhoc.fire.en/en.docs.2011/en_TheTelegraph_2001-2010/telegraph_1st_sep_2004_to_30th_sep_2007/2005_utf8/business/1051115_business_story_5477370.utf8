 Timken pulls out of NRB Bearings

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 14: Timken France SAS has exited from NRB Bearings, the ball and roller bearings manufacturer. The Sahney family, promoters of NRB has bought the foreign collaborators 26 per cent stake for a sum of Rs 57.96 crore. 

 Both the Indian promoters and Timken France had been negotiating on the acquisition of this stake amounting to 25.20 lakh shares, or 26 per cent of NRBs share capital. 

 The NRB officials said, in pursuant to these discussions, the Sahney family on Monday purchased Timkens entire shareholding in the company through two of their investment vehicles. ICICI Securities acted as the advisor to the Sahney family for this deal.

 NRB was jointly promoted by the Sahney family and Nadella SA (now known as Timken France SAS) in 1966. However, the technological collaboration between the two promoters expired in 1998. Since then, Timken was largely a financial investor in the Indian venture. 

 They (Timken) were not adding value and therefore negotiations began on buying out their stake. Moreover, NRB has been developing and introducing new products on its own, sources close to the deal cited as the reason for the break off. 

 Further, the buyout will provide a good flexibility to the current management in supplying NRB products to global OEMs, they added.

 The Timken shareholding has been bought at a price of Rs 230 per share.

 Taj group ready for Bhutan check-in

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New address 

 Mumbai, Jan. 24: Indian Hotels Company has signed a deal under which it will run a hotel in Thimphu, the picturesque Bhutan capital, under a management contract.

 ?We expect the plan to crystallise by the year-end. The facilities are now being upgraded to our standards,? senior vice-president (finance) Anil P. Goel said. 

 The capital of Bhutan, spread along the River Raidak at an altitude of 7,000 feet has a population of 48,300 but is yet to earn a star-spangled badge for its hotels. That will change once the Taj takes its insignia there.

 The Thimpu plan is part of the hotel chain?s recent strategy of sewing up management contracts for new properties. It recently opened a beach-head in Seychelles with a luxury resort that will be called Taj Denis. 

 Managing director Raymond Bickson, speaking at a press conference to announce third-quarter results, said the hotel industry is one of the most resilient sectors in the economy. He was referring to the way the industry weathered the SARS pandemic in 2003 and the way it is coping with devastation wreaked by the recent tsunami.

 The numbers tell the story. The group?s net profit surged 110.66 per cent to Rs 34.97 crore for the quarter ended December from Rs 16.60 crore in the same period of last year.

 The gains were fuelled by a 29.42 per cent rise in income at Rs 252.58 crore compared with Rs 195.15 crore. Staff costs went up to Rs 57.14 crore from Rs 49.85 crore while licence fees jumped to Rs 28.87 crore from Rs 18.07 crore. The rise in licence fee is attributed to the growing number of new properties the chain manages for owners.

 ?We would like to go for management contracts,? Goel added.

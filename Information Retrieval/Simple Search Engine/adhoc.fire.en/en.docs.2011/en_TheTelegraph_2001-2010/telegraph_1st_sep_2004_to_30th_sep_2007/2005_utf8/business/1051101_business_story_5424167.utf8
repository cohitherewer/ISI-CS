 Aiyar frets over RIL refinery shutdown

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 31: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today obliquely hinted that the shutting down of the Reliance refinery in Jamnagar for maintenance and repair has adversely affected LPG supply in the country even as he urged state government and distributors to stop diversion of subsidised LPG cylinders to unauthorised commercial users.

 The most serious disruption in recent weeks has been caused by the shut-down of a private sector refinery for carrying out repairs. The shut-down was notified at a time when a sudden shortage of LPG developed in international markets owing to the hit that refineries in the US took on account of hurricanes Katrina, Rita and now Wilma. This complicated our import arrangements, Aiyar said in a statement.

 He also urged distributors and state governments to act in concert to cap, reduce and eliminate the disturbing diversion of subsidised LPG for domestic purposes to unauthorised commercial uses. This includes the dangerous practice of fitting LPG cylinders to auto-rickshaws and other vehicles that are not properly equipped to run on cylinders.

 He said that oil marketing companies and the ministry are monitoring the availability of LPG on a day-to-day basis and are prepared to take any corrective action whenever necessary.

 Besides, political disturbances in Manipur, floods in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh and the derailing of rail wagons carrying domestic LPG have led to the build-up of a backlog in parts of the country.

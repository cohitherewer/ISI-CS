 Foreigners bet on animation 

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, Aug. 9: Foreign investments are expected to start flowing into the Indian animation industry within the next three months.

 According to the industry sources, Hollywood animation companies are eyeing India to source contents.

 Some of the Indian firms have already entered into agreements with production houses in Italy and the UK for providing animation content and jointly market the co-produced projects.

 Bhuvan Lall, president of the Animation Producers Association of India confirmed that certain US firms have evinced interest in setting up their shops in India as well as sourcing content from local players. A clear picture regarding the nature of the foreign investments will emerge over the next 45-60 days, Lall said.

 What prompts foreign companies to outsource their animation contents from Indian companies is the huge disparity in rates.

 The billing rates last year for animation production services in India ranged from $2,000 to $5,250 per minute depending on the complexity in two-dimensional animation and between $4,500 and $7,000 per minute of work for three-dimensional animation films. This represents a 30 per cent increase for 3-D and a 50 per cent rise for 2-D production over the previous year.

 The rates are still substantially lower than $17,0000-$25,0000 in the US and European markets.

 With the global animation industry is estimated to grow at around $80 billion by the end of the year, this cost-competitiveness offers Indian companies a comparative advantage in bagging a large chunk of content-supply orders.

 The producers association is also studying the growth patterns of the industry in countries like France, China and Korea. 

 In India, the biggest hurdle to animation growth is the lack of skilled manpower. quot;It is estimated that there will be a demand for around 30,000 animators in the next three years, Lall pointed out.

 However, the available training facilities are inadequate to train such a huge skilled force and companies end up spending both time and money in training personnel, Lall added.

 Furthermore, the domestic industry is fragmented and there is no data available on the rate of production or skill level of human resources.

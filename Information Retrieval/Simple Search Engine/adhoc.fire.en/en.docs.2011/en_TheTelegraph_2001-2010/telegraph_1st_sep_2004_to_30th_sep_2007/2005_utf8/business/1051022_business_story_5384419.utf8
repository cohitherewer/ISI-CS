 Respite for Bharat Sanchar

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 21: The Supreme Court today allowed Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) to continue to levy a transit charge of 19 paise per minute on private cellular operators for providing interconnectivity through its cellular networks gateway. 

 However, BSNL has been asked not to enforce collection till further orders of the court.

 A bench comprising Justice Arijit Pasayat and Justice Arun Kumar issued notices to the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) and private telecom service providers ? Bharti Cellular, BPL Mobile (now bought over by Hutch-Essar) and Idea Cellular Ltd.

 The appeal by BSNL challenged a Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) order, which stopped the state-owned firm from levying transit charges on private mobile operators.

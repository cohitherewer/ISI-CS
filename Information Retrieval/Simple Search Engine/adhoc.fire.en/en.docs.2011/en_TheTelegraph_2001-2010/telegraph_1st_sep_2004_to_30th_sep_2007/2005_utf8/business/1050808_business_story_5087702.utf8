 Morgan leads race for A-I job

 Mumbai, Aug. 7 (PTI): JP Morgan has emerged as a front-runner to advise Air-India (A-I) on its initial public offering (IPO).

 The management committee shortlisted two firms, including DSP Merrill Lynch, from the six investment bankers which made a presentation last month, A-I sources said here today. Two firms made attractive offers to clinch the mandate for drawing up a roadmap for the state-owned carriers planned public offering, they said.

 SBI Caps, DSP Merrill Lynch and HSBC Securities were among the ones to have made a presentation last month. About 15 firms had expressed their interest in the job.

 Debt-equity norms of 2:1 make it ideal for A-I to raise Rs 10,000 crore through the flotation. The ratio is a benchmark in the capital-intensive industry, sources said.

 The airline has a share capital of Rs 153.84 crore, which is fully subscribed by the central government, and an authorised capital of Rs 500 crore. It has a turnover of $1.5 billion (Rs 6,500 crore) and assets of Rs 7,000 crore.

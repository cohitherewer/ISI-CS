 GM gears up to hike capacity

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, April 27: General Motors India (GMI) plans to invest Rs 150 crore by 2006 to increase its manufacturing capacity by 20,000 vehicles. 

 General Motors India president and managing director Aditya Vij said, ?We plan to become a volume player in India.?

 Vij said General Motors (GM), the parent company, was also exploring several options to augment its manufacturing capacity in India. ?The Daewoo option is in its last stages and if resolved, it will pave the way for GM to become a major player in India,? he added. 

 He said the Indian subsidiary predicted a 50 per cent increase in its sales in the current fiscal at 40,000 units against 26,200 units. 

 ?We also plan to launch two products next year,? he added.

 ?The car market in India is a most punishing market in pricing and also represented a huge small car segment,? he said, adding that India will overtake Europe by 2020 in the small car sector. 

 On the ?recall? thrust in the US, Vij said there has been no major recalls due to either regulatory environment or safety aspects in India so far. 

 ?But I assure you that the Indian customer will be treated on a par with those elsewhere in the world,? he added.

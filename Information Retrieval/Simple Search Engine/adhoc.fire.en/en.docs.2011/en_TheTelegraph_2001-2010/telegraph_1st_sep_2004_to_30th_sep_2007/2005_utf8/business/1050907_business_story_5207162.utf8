 Campaign for soft rate regime

 Paris, Sept. 6 (Reuters): The OECD advised the US Federal Reserve on Tuesday to ease the pace at which it raises interest rates in the wake of the death, devastation and oil supply disruption caused by Hurricane Katrina.

 The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), however, stuck to its forecast of 3.6 per cent US growth this year, saying it was impossible to gauge the impact of Katrina in any precise way for now.

 The Paris-based agency, whose 30 members are mostly the rich industrialised nations of the world, said it was also worried by the threat to economic activity from an oil price surge that was similar to those of the 1970s in scale.

 It said the European Central Bank should remain very accommodative in terms of interest rates and chief economist Jean-Philippe Cotis said there was in any case no place for considering a rate rise soon. Theres no urgent need to tighten interest rates, Cotis said.

 The Fed raised its key rate for the 10th time running on August 9, to 4.50 per cent while the ECB has kept its key euro zone rate on hold again last week at a historic low of 2 per cent.

 The Federal Reserve should continue to move back toward neutrality (from an accommodative policy), although possibly at a more measured pace than hitherto, Cotis said.

 He said it was hard to say for now whether talk of a second-half upturn in the euro zone would be realised, though he said there was hope that Germanys strong export performance was starting to have a knock-on effect in terms of upturning investment.

 The Bank of England could afford to cut rates in Britain, for which the OECD cut its growth forecast significantly, as long as inflation looked under control, Cotis said.

 The OECD raised its 2005 GDP growth forecast for the euro zone to 1.3 from 1.2 per cent but Cotis remained cautious about prospects for recovery.

 Lets hope it will not be like in the past where there were signs of recovery that then faded, he said.

 The OECD cut Britains outlook to 1.9 from 2.4 per cent and Germany to 1 from 1.2, but raised Italy from minus 0.6 to 0.2 per cent and France to 1.6 from 1.4 per cent.

 The OECD publishes more complete forecasts twice yearly in a report called the Economic Outlook, the next version of which is due in November.

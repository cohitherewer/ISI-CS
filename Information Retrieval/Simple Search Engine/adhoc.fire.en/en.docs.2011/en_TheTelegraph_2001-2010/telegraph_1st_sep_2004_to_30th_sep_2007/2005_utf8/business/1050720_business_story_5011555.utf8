 Chandra: Gift-wrapped

 Mumbai, July 19: Subhash Chandra and his associates will acquire over 68.63 lakh shares of Essel Propack from foreign collaborator and co-promoter, Arfen Hus (AHL) of Mauritius, at a price of Rs 330 per share.

 At this price, they will have to shell out Rs 226.48 crore for the shares, which represent 21.91 per cent of the issued and paid-up share capital of Essel Propack. The company is the largest speciality packaging firm in the world with a significant presence in laminated tubes.

 The Essel group, controlled by Chandra, said the shares would be transferred after July 26. After the acquisition, the shareholding of Chandra and his associates in Essel Propack will go up to 58.92 per cent. It pointed out that the acquisition would not necessitate a public offer under the takeover regulations framed by Sebi.

 AHL acquired the shares after the international laminate tube-making assets of its firm, Propack Holdings, were merged with Essel Packing. Essel Propack has a global presence in the laminated tube business with 20 manufacturing bases spread in 13 countries. Recently, the company announced plans to invest $15 million in its facility at Danville in the US. This was in line with its strategic initiatives for the US and Americas.

 In April this year, it acquired Telcon Packaging of the UK. The company is one of the two manufacturers of laminated tubes in Britain, where it has a 12 per cent market share. It also one of Europes leading laminated tube suppliers. 

 The acquisition is expected to strengthen Essel Propacks manufacturing muscle in Europe. It also enabled the company to harness the knowledge of the two main technologies for making laminated tubes. The move provided the company with a local manufacturing base in the UK, enabling it to win major contracts in Europe.

 Meanwhile, Essel Propack has commenced commercial production at its plant in Russia, which was so far being fed from manufacturing units in other countries.

 Reliance Info pays up Rs 150 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 All in a day?s work

 New Delhi, March 7: Reliance Infocomm today paid Rs 150 crore to the department of telecommunication (DoT) as penalty for routing international calls as local calls and thus violating licence conditions.

 The Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) last week had held Reliance Infocomm guilty of violating the licence condition and directed the company to pay up the penalty by Monday.

 While senior company executives were not ready to commit about the future course of action, sources in the company said they would soon approach the Supreme Court.

 However, industry observers pointed out that Reliance Infocomm had no choice but to pay up the penalty since DoT had secured a caveat in Supreme Court against any move by the company to get a stay on the payment.

 The company said, ?Reliance Infocomm has today paid a sum of Rs 150 crore to DoT in accordance with the orders of the TDSAT. The payment has been made so that the issues in dispute can be viewed dispassionately.?

 The statement also highlighted the fact that the ?payment has been made without accepting the findings of the TDSAT. We will explore all avenues to establish that the service provided has been in accordance with the licence conditions.?

 DoT had charged Reliance Infocomm of converting international calls made on its network as local calls and thus avoided the payment of the access deficit charge (ADC) to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL). This, DoT pointed out, was a violation of the licence conditions and hence Reliance should pay a penalty.

 ADC is a charge paid by private operators to fund the setting up of phones by BSNL in rural areas.

 At the centre of the controversy is a system called home country direct (HCD) services. This enables the company to route calls at rates mutually agreed between them. DoT has alleged that HCD is not a valid service and that the company had tampered with the caller line identification (CLI) and this has been upheld by the TDSAT.

 However, Reliance Infocomm still maintains that quot;there has been no impropriety on our part. We have full faith in the judicial process and are confident of vindicating our stand.?

 The company maintains that the HCD service offered by it was fully recognised by the International Telecom Union. 

 It has pointed out that the decision of the company to route calls at rates mutually agreed between two operators is no way a violation of the licence conditions.

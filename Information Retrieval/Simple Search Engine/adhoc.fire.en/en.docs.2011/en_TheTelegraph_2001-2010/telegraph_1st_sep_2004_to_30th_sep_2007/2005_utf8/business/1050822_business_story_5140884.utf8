 Merger mail arrives in courier consignment

 Eastward ahoy!

 Mumbai, Aug. 21: The organised segment of the express and logistics industry is on a consolidation drive as foreign giants like Federal Express, UPS and TNT eye a bigger market share in India.

 The companies have started looking at the sector aggressively after DHL?s acquisition of Blue Dart last year.

 The takeover made the German multinational company a big player in the Indian express and logistics industry. DHL is on the lookout for more such deals. 

 Other companies are also on the prowl for prime buyout candidates as part of their efforts to attain critical mass in an economy growing at around 7 per cent.

 Recent reports suggest the Netherlands-based TNT is keen on acquiring Gati Ltd. Though the latter denied being in negotiations, industry observers do not rule out the possibility of TNT chasingfresh targets.

 ?There are four big global players in the industry now ? DHL, Federal Express, UPS and TNT. India is a focus area for all of them. They are keen to expand through the inorganic route,? said an industry observer.

 The domestic express industry includes courier companies that deliver shipments other than freight to various destinations. The consignments handled by these companies are categorised into documents and non-documents.

 Documents include materials made of paper such as annual reports, books, correspondence and brochures, while the non-documents category covers items like small machinery, spare parts and samples.

 The industry also has unorganised and semi-organised players operating within a limited area and companies with technology-based infrastructure. While services offered by those in the unorganised segment are cheaper, it is forecast that over a period of time, they are likely to go out of business at the national level.

 Documents contribute the bulk of revenues to courier firms in the unorganised and semi-organised segments. In documents, the value-addition is low, but so are the margins.

 Observers said the focus of multinationals will largely be on companies with a sizeable presence in the non-document segment. 

 ?The existing customer base available from such an acquisition will easily enable the foreign players to scale up operations and their presence,? a leading express company official said. 

 Other express service providers in the organised sector are AFL Pvt Ltd, DTDC Worldwide Express Ltd, First Flight Couriers, Overnite Express Ltd and Professional Couriers. 

 The bulk category, which is marked by value-added services such as logistics and supply chain management, is attracting several new players who want to seize the opportunity generated by the rapid growth of Indian economy and increased trade with other countries.

 Prominent among them is Panalpina, which provides forwarding and logistics services globally and specialises in intercontinental air and ocean freight shipments and associated supply chain management solutions. AFL, Gati, DHL and TNT are also present in this segment.

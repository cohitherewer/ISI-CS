 Drug firms ready for switchover

 New Delhi, Dec. 31 (PTI): The pharmaceutical industry is prepared to meet the product patent regime which kickstarts tomorrow, according to D. G. Shah, secretary-general of Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA). IPA represents India?s 10 leading drug firms.

 Ramesh L. Adige, vice-president (corporate affairs), Ranbaxy Labs, and Harinder Sikka, senior vice-president (corporate affairs), Nicholas Piramal felt that drugs prices would not get affected as about 90 per cent of medicines were off patent.

 However, Adige was not sure how certain provisions would shape up when rules are spelt out due to lack of clarity in the ordinance, which was promulgated on December 26.

 ?The ordinance does not reflect clearly the provisions with regard to pre-grant opposition,? he said.

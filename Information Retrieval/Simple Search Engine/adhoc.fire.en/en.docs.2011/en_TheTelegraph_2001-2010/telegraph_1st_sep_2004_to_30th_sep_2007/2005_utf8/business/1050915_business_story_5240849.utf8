 Six in fray for twin airport makeover

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Time to spruce up

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: Six consortia, including Anil Ambani-run Reliance Energy, Subhash Chandras Essel Group, Sterlite and London- based DS Constructions, have filed bids for Delhi and Mumbai airports.

 Others included GVK Industries and Hyderabad-based GMR. Five of the six bid for both the Rs 2,800-crore Delhi airport update and the Rs 2,600-crore Mumbai airport modernisation plan. 

 GVK Industries bid for only Mumbai. The Essel Group put in its bid three minutes late. This led to protests from other contenders but it was finally allowed in.

 The Bharti-Changi and Piramal-Hotchief Airport combine have already pulled out. 

 Civil aviation secretary Ajay Prasad said tender norms had been frozen in June and there was little ground for anybody to criticise the authorities at this late stage. He pointed out that performance guarantees were a globally acceptable norm.

 Prasad said the date for opening the technical bids would be announced soon and only those bidders that meet 80 per cent of the parameters defined in the document would reach the financial bidding round. He hoped to wrap up the process by December.

 He said the transaction documents handed over to the eight pre-qualified bidders on August 30, 2005, had been drawn up after discussions with the civil aviation ministry. 

 Prasad said Bharti had informed the ministry that Singapores Changi Airport found the time frame for completion of phase I very difficult and was not confident of completing the capital works. It was also dissatisfied that the tilt of responsibility on meeting performance parameters was too much on the airport operator than on the joint venture company.

 Hotchief Airport wanted a review of the entire document which was impossible to accept at this late stage, he added.

 The new policy under which the government has accepted bids for Delhi and Mumbai airports, will see the government retaining a 26 per cent stake through Airport Authority of India, while another 25 per cent will be held by Indians, including Indian financial institutions. But the remaining 49 per cent and strategic control will, however, be held by the private partner in the airports.

 Air-India

 Air-Indias plan for fleet purchase from Boeing will be sent to the Public Investment Board by this month-end, Prasad said.

 New-age tech firms deck up to strut their stuff

 Los Angeles, Jan. 5: A new-format skirmish in the consumer electronics cosmos may escalate into a full-blown declaration of war later this week, when the annual International Consumer Electronics Show extravaganza opens in Las Vegas. 

 While the matter of which format dominates the future of home video will be a focus of the show, there will be the usual array of dandy new electrified goodies: new big-screen monitors, advanced digital cameras and camcorders, and the rumour of a new iPod and desktop computer to arrive the day after the show, at Macworld in San Francisco. 

 But the issue with the most potential for controversy revolves around the next generation of digital video; the contestants are Blu-ray and HD-DVD. The stakes are enormous: control of the future of high-definition movies for the home. 

 Throughout the past year two camps have emerged in the development of this HD technology. The Blu-ray Disc, invented in part by Sony, is backed by companies such as Pioneer and Thomson, and computer makers H-P and Dell; only last month, Disneys Buena Vista Home Entertainment division announced a quot;non-exclusive quot; arrangement to support Blu-ray. The non-exclusive caveat means that a studio could switch to the other format if conditions dictate. Commitments to release movies in HD-DVD formula, which was developed by Japanese electronics giants Toshiba and NEC, have been made by Paramount, NBC Universal and Warner Bros., among others. 

 Both new discs will offer a detailed image comparable to a high-definition TV broadcast, as well as improved audio quality and greater storage capacity, which will allow longer films to be placed on a single disc. 

 While some Blu-ray devices ? so-called because they employ a blue laser ? are already on sale in Japan for $2,000 and up, its not anticipated that hardware or content in either format will be available in the United States until late this year or early 2006. 

 Although the DVD market continues to scoop up revenue ? consumers were expected to shell out nearly $30 billion buying and renting video discs last year ? analysts expect sales to slow significantly, and Hollywood is desperate to settle on a new, better format to complement the burgeoning sales of high-def video equipment. 

 In November, the Consumer Electronics Association offered a preview of some other products that might generate buzz next year when the group announced its 2005 Innovations Awards. Smaller than most cell phones, Panasonics SV-AV50 SD Video Camera will be on hand, along with a novel flat-panel computer monitor from LG Electronics with quot;f-Engine quot; technology, said to separate the relationship between brightness and colour so that each can be adjusted separately. Also scheduled for show is the new Delphi MyFi XM2Go, the first self-contained portable satellite radio receiver with a battery life of five hours. 

 This year, well over 100,000 visitors are expected to crowd the Las Vegas Convention Center for the Thursday through Sunday consumer electronics trade show, where sight (giant plasma monitors) and sound (enormous mobile sound systems with multi sub-woofers) will vie for attention. 

 Products from more than 2,400 exhibitors will be presented, with the major players monopolising the massive show floor when the show opens Thursday. 

 Coming off the heels of the show next Monday is Macworld in San Francisco, where another bubble of excitement is growing. At that seminal event, Apple chief executive Steve Jobs is rumoured to be debuting a quot;prequel quot; to the iPod music player, a less expensive (about $150) device that uses flash memory instead of a hard disc, and a $500-ish mini-PowerPC G4 computer that will anchor the low-end of the Mac range of desktops.

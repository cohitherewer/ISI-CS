 Calcutta, Jan. 10: Beeyu Overseas Limited plans to acquire a tea manufacturing plant in Sri Lanka within the next six months.

 ?We wish to acquire a plant with a production capacity of 1 million kgs per annum. Our technical team will go to Sri Lanka during March-April to identify the prospects,? executive chairman B. P. Singh said.

 The company has outlined an initial investment of Rs 2 crore for the acquisition and will consider further expansion after operating in the island nation for a year.

 The company is aiming at becoming the third largest producer of tea in south India and increasing its production capacity to 6,000 tonnes per annum from the current level of 3,000 tonnes.

 For this purpose, the company plans to set up additional CTC and orthodox tea production facilities at Ooty.

 During the first phase of the programme, the company will set up one CTC and orthodox tea factory, which will become operational in 2005. This will double the company?s current manufacturing capacity from 3,000 tonnes per annum to 6,000 tonnes per annum.

 The second phase involves setting up another factory, which will be commissioned in 2006 and will increase the production to 6,000 tonnes per annum.

 ?In view of the economies of scale, the cost of conversion from green leaf to black leaf will come down to Rs 8 per kg compared with a standard of Rs 12 per kg,? said Singh.

 The expansion project will involve a total capital outlay of Rs 18 crore, of which Rs 15 crore will be funded by a public issue and the remaining by a term loan from State Bank of India (SBI).

 ?The public issue will hit the market in February and we have already lined up the term loan from SBI,? said Singh.

 The Beeyu shares will be listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange after the public issue.

 The company has a joint venture with Tata Coffee for manufacturing coffee within the country. ?A technical team representing both the companies will visit four European countries to finalise the technology for coffee production,? said Singh.

 The coffee manufacturing plant will be set up near Madurai and will require a tie-up from Europe keeping in view its complex technological requirement, added Singh. The project requires an investment of Rs 80 crore. Currently, the company exports 1,000 tonnes of tea and does not sell in the domestic market.

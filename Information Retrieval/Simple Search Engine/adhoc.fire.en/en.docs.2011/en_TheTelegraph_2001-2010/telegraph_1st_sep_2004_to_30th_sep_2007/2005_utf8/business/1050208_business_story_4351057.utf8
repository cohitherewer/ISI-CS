 Airbus wants local airlines to try A380

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: Airbus, which has bagged the mega-Indian Airlines contract to sell 43 aircraft valued at over Rs 9,000 crore, now wants Indian carriers to consider buying the world?s largest aicraft ? the Airbus A380.

 The European aircraft maker wants Air-India to consider revising its purchase plans and consider the A380 for high-density routes to the Gulf and Southeast Asia.

 Although it has pitted its A330 and A340 against Boeing products for the Air-India contract for 28 long-haul aircraft, Airbus says airlines in India should also consider the new product in the light of the changed dynamics in the aviation market. 

 Air-India?s proposal to expand its fleet is likely to be cleared by the government early this year. Air India wants to buy up to 35 aircraft worth more than $2.2 billion over the next few years. It will be placing orders for 10 long-range planes with an option to pick up another seven. The financial bids closed today. The two planes in the fray are the Boeing 777 ER and Airbus 340, though sources said the government would prefer to take the Boeing.

 The government wants to be even-handed in giving out orders to the two major aircraft makers: since Airbus bagged the Indian Airlines order, it would like to give the other big order to Boeing to keep the US ? its new-found ally ? happy.

 Airbus?s bid to pit the A380 is seen as an attempt to change the rules of the contest by asking the state-run carrier to consider future growth on high-density routes before deciding on its aircraft order.

 Analysts feel if Airbus? bid succeeds, Air-India would divide its purchase plan and place at least some orders with Airbus.

 The A380, which was launched with great fanfare last month in Toulose, can carry over 650 passengers, though most airlines plan to use it to seat about 500- 550 passengers.

 However, Indian airports are not equipped to handle the huge aircraft. Currently, only Delhi and Mumbai airports can handle this aircraft by parking it in a remote bay and ferrying passengers to it. 

 Airbus is already in talks with Indian Airlines for a mix of Airbus-319s, Airbus-320s and Airbus-321s to be delivered over four years between 2004 and 2008.

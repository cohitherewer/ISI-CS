The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 SAP move to lure Oracle customers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sedghi: One step ahead

 Calcutta, Aug. 30: SAP has taken Oracle head on in the multi-billion dollar enterprise applications business in the Asia-Pacific region.

 It is facilitating the migration of customers of PeopleSoft, J.D. Edwards and Retek (companies recently acquired by Oracle) to the SAP product platform through TomorrowNow. 

 SAP had recently acquired TomorrowNow ? a software maintenance company. Globally, software maintenance is a billion-dollar industry.

 TomorrowNow is expanding in the Asia-Pacific region with a presence in Singapore. It is offering software maintenance services to customers of PeopleSoft and J.D. Edwards at almost half the price.

 Worldwide, there are around 220 customers of PeopleSoft and J.D. Edwards who have opted for our maintenance services instead of choosing Oracle. Of these, 20 are in the Asia-Pacific region, said Alan Sedghi, president and CEO of SAP South Asia.

 Globally, 21 customers of PeopleSoft, J.D. Edwards or Retek have already joined the SAP Safe Passage programme since its launch a year ago. 

 The A-Pac region is gaining importance for SAP, especially in the small and medium business (SMB) segment. This segment is categorised as companies with turnover of less than Rs 400 crore.

 The mid-market segment is also important for the business solutions provider as it contributes to more than 50 per cent of its total software revenue from the region.

 India is among the top six revenue earners in the A-Pac region for the SMB segment, said Sedghi. We are looking at opportunities in the banking and financial services, retail, utilities, IT and the telecom sector for growth.

 SAP India has grown 50 per cent in the first half of 2005 compared with the same period last year. It added 42 new customers during the period.

 SAP will launch an India-specific integrated solution for the SMB segment in the second half of this year.

 We also intend to intensify partner participation in the SMB segment. Currently, we have 12 partners to cater to this segment in India, said Sedghi.

 SAP also plans to double its headcount in the next two years from a global employee base of 4,500. Its Indian operations are expected to grow substantially.

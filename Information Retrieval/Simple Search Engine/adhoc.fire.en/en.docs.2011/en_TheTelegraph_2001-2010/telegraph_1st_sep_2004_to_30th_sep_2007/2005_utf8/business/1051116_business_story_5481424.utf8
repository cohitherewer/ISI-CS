 UTI Bank keen on core sector funding

 GAURAV CHOUDHURY

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: UTI Bank is planning to float a venture capital fund dedicated to financing infrastructure projects. This is one of the many courses the bank has charted to grow organically.

 The venture capital fund will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the UTI Bank and we are looking at an initial corpus of Rs 500 crore for the take-off, UTI Banks president (capital markets) M. M. Agrawal told The Telegraph. 

 While the parent bank will provide the best part of the proposed fund, the rest will be raised from high networth individuals and institutions.

 Going ahead, the bank could also consider a joint venture with a foreign bank or an institution if an opportunity comes, added Agarwal.

 The venture capital fund, when operationalised, will not only provide direct financing to infrastructure projects, but also consider picking up equity in companies executing such projects.

 Agrawal mentioned that UTI bank has already sought the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) approval for setting up a full-fledged asset management company.

 The bank has also written to market regulator Sebi to register itself as a custodian. The move aims at tapping the foreign institutional investors (FIIs) crowding around the Indian bourses. Registered FIIs often appoint an approved agency as their custodian for transaction of securities and information reporting.

 The bank has also firmed up an aggressive plan for overseas expansion. And Singapore is where it wants to go first. For establishing a banking unit there, UTI Bank has approached the apex bank for its go-ahead.

 We expect the approval will come in by the first week of January, Agarwal said. 

 We are also looking keenly at Pakistan as a potential market, he added.

 The bank has meanwhile written to the authorities in Sri Lanka for opening up three branches in the island country. Its also mulling full-fledged branches in Shanghai, Dubai and London, in addition to one representative office in Hong Kong.

 The offshore branches will offer specialised financial and banking services such as trading in foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) and consultations in global depository receipt (GDR) floats, besides core banking services.

 UTI Bank, however, is not open to acquisition of any bank in the near term. There are no plans for any acquisition. We are focussing on our own organic expansions right now. Neither do we have a plan to come out shortly with a fresh equity issue as the bank has adequate capital, Agarwal said.

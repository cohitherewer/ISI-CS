 Steel makers to take price call in June

 Calcutta, May 25: The softening of global steel prices could soon lead to a correction in domestic rates.

 Internationally, hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices have corrected by about $100 since April even as the prices are firm in India.

 Vinod Garg, executive director (marketing) of Ispat, said there could be a correction in the domestic market as international prices have come down.

 We will take a call on June 1. The reduction may not be as much as in the international market, Garg added.

 According to industry estimates, domestic prices may soften by $25-50 a tonne on indications of international prices turning around.

 Even though the prices have softened globally since April, the export at that rate is yet to be felt in India.

 Generally, there is a lag of three months before the effect of international rates is felt here.

 An Essar official said the company was keeping an eye on international prices. We take a call on prices every quarter. The company has not changed its prices in the last quarter, the official added.

 At present, the domestic prices are hovering at Rs 28,000-29,000 a tonne ($636-$660) while the ruling free-on-board (f..b) prices in Europe is about $500-$550. 

 After adding the transport charge and a 5 per cent duty protection, the landed cost still works out to be cheaper than domestic prices.

 The development comes at a time when the Indian Steel Alliance (ISA) ? the body of integrated steel makers in the country ? is seeking duty protection from cheap imports.

 ISA said it wanted to raise the duty to 15 per cent from 5 per cent at present to stop cheap imports from CIS, Russia, Ukraine and Romania.

 Steel is being imported at an average of $470 a tonne. This has led to a moderate-to-high stockpile with all domestic players. As a consequence, local players could be forced to cut prices, industry observers said.

 However, if the government agrees to a duty hike, the reduction in local market may not be steep.

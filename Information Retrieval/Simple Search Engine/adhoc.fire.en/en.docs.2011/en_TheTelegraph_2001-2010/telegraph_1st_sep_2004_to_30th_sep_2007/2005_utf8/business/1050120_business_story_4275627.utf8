 IDBI meet on merger today

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 19: The boards of Industrial Development Bank of India and IDBI Bank will meet tomorrow to decide on the merger of the two entities.

 The merger has been on the cards for sometime now, but observers have their eyes on the swap ratio that is likely to be announced at the meeting. 

 Both IDBI and IDBI Bank had appointed independent valuers to carry out a due diligence exercise and formulate a swap ratio. The due diligence exercise was completed last month.

 Reports suggest the swap could be in the ratio of 1:2.25 or nine shares of IDBI Bank for every four shares of IDBI. This ratio, observers say, will see to it that the governments holding in the merged entity does not fall below 51 per cent.

 On the BSE today, shares of IDBI Bank gained after this announcement. Opening at Rs 70.20, the scrip rose to a days high of Rs 74.90 and closed at Rs 71.35, a gain of 2.36 per cent over its last close. 

 However, shares of IDBI closed weak at Rs 113.30. The scrip opened at Rs 116.25 and moved to an intra-day high of Rs 119.10.

 The government owns 58.48 per cent of IDBI. Institutional investors comprising mutual funds and UTI, banks, financial institutions and insurance companies hold a 23.23 per cent stake, while 13.53 per cent is with the public. The remaining stake is held by NRIs and private corporate bodies.

 In IDBI Bank, the promoters ? IDBI and Sidbi ? hold 69.17 per cent, institutional investors own 9.93 per cent, the public has a 16.90 per cent stake, while private corporate bodies and NRIs/OCBs hold the rest.

 Post-merger, the balancesheet size of the entity will be close to Rs 80,000 crore. In preparation for the merger, IDBI has initiated various steps like a voluntary retirement scheme and a revamp of its HR practices. 

 IDBI had also appointed consultants to recast the compensation structure. New HR practices are being introduced, which would include performance appraisals and incentives for employees.

 Last October, IDBI chairman M. Damodaran had said the merged entity would strive to be the second largest player in the countrys financial market. He did not rule out adopting the inorganic route for growth. 

 Post-merger, the entity could look at acquisitions, particularly of public sector banks, to expand its business and asset base, Damodaran had added.

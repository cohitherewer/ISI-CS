 Numaligarh in Bangla diesel deal

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Wheel of fortune

 New Delhi, Dec. 4: Numaligarh Refinery (NRL) has offered to supply 50,000 tonnes of diesel to Bangladesh. The total value of the deal could work out to around Rs 120 crore.

 While 40,000 tonnes of this despatch would be shipped through the river route, the rest could be transported by road. 

 Senior NRL and Bharat Petroleum officials are reported to have met their counterparts in Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation in Dhaka recently and discussed the diesel export deal.

 A senior petroleum ministry official told The Telegraph that the NRL proposal has a lot of economic sense for Bangladesh but the political clearance would have to come through from Dhaka for the deal to go through.

 NRL is offering diesel at very competitive prices to Bangladesh, which is currently getting its supplies from the Gulf countries. This entails a huge transport cost because the ships from the Gulf have to go around Sri Lanka to reach Chittagong. Once the consignment reaches Chittagong there is a long haul to the hinterland that can be reached more easily from Numaligarh. 

 NRL is virtually in the backyard of Bangladesh and there is huge saving in transport costs if the diesel is supplied directly, a senior official said. 

 NRL has already sent a consignment of diesel to Budge Budge on a river barge that travelled through Bangladesh to reach its final stop. Another consignment of diesel is being sent down the river to Budge Budge. 

 Since the waterway has been successfully tested a proposal has been drawn up to ship 40.000 tonnes of diesel over a year to the river port of Baghbari in Bangladesh. Another 10,00 tonnes can be transported by road to the border town of Dauki through Sylhet.

 NRL produces 1.8 million tonnes of diesel and has been facing a problem in evacuating its products as the demand in the northeast states is far short of its refining capacity.

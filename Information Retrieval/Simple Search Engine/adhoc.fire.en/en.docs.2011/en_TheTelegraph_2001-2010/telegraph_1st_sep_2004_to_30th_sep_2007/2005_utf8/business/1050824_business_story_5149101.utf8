 Nokia bags $125m Bharti network deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: Nokia has bagged a $125-million contract from Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd to manage and expand the network in Calcutta, Bengal and Madhya Pradesh circles.

 Under the deal, Nokia will expand the network in eight circles (five old and three new) based on the global system of mobile communications, enhanced data rate for global evolution (EDGE) services and general packet radio services (GPRS).

 Last year, Nokia had bagged a $275-million contract from Bharti to supply equipment for two years and manage services for three years across five circles.

 Ericsson is the only other vendor providing services in the 15 remaining circles.

 As part of the deal, Nokia will deploy the Connect GSM solution, which will help Bharti Tele-Ventures expand network coverage in rural areas in a cost-effective manner.

 This includes solutions for radio access and network management systems and services that will reduce the total cost of ownership for the company and allow it to optimally target the low average revenue per user customer.

 Nokia will provide managed services and expand the AirTel networks in the circles of Mumbai, Maharashtra (including Goa), Gujarat, Bihar (including Jharkhand) and Orissa in three years.

 Nokias managed capacity expansion will also help AirTel cover more than 5,000 towns compared with 2,700 at present.

 Nokia Networks country director Ashish Chowdhary said, The phased expansion in these towns and villages will start immediately and is likely to be completed by March 2006.

 The expansion will double Bhartis network capacity, reduce congestion and provide seamless coverage, said Chowdhary.

 The extensive managed services capability, combined with Nokias comprehensive and high quality product portfolio, makes a strong business case for Bharti to provide affordable mobile services to rural consumers.

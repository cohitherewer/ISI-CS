 Carmakers blame it on VAT

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 16: Carmakers, who have announced price hikes blaming it on steel price raises, now say new tail-pipe emission norms and the value added tax (VAT) regime are equally big ?culprits?. 

 Tata Motors, the second largest carmaker, said today it would raise prices of its cars by 2 to 3 per cent in April on account of higher costs of inputs like steel as well as the new emission norms. A spokesperson for the company added that the VAT regime, which is expected to be introduced from April 1, is also a reason for the price hike. 

 Tata Motors officials said, ?A host of other factors are responsible for the price increase?, though steel prices and emission norms are the principal reasons. A spokesman for the company?s commercial vehicles division said there was no decision yet on raising prices. 

 The 4 per cent increase in steel prices because of higher excise duties levied in this year?s budget actually translates into a 0.3 per cent increase in car input prices as steel makes up for about 7 per cent of the total cost of a vehicle. Mahindra amp; Mahindra said it would raise prices of some of its models from April because of the new emission norms and high steel prices.

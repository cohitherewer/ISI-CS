 Film sales blur Kodak picture

 Image problem

 New York, April 23 (Reuters): Eastman Kodak Co. suffered a quarterly net loss on Friday as sales in its traditional film business fell faster than expected, overshadowing solid growth in digital photography, and its shares tumbled as much as 10 per cent. 

 Revenue dropped 3 per cent as traditional film sales declined, particularly in China, and weakness at Kodak?s medical imaging group. Film sales remain important to Kodak because the Rochester, New York-based company is using the cash they generate to fund its switch to digital cameras, printers and other products. 

 ?I continue to think that the Kodak story is very risky,? said analyst Shannon Cross of Cross Research. ?They are juggling many balls, and if one of them gets dropped, then their earnings get hit. 

 Kodak reported a first-quarter net loss of $142 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with a profit of $21 million, or 7 cents a share, in the same period last year. 

 Excluding one-time charges of 53 cents a share, operating earnings were 3 cents a share ? well short of Wall Street views of 33 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. 

 ?We are disappointed in the results ... (but) we will deliver the (earnings) year we said we?d deliver,? said chief executive Dan Carp on a conference call with analysts in which the company stood by its full year 2005 profit forecast. 

 Investors were not as optimistic. Kodak shares were down $3.28, or 10.8 per cent, to $27.12 on the New York Stock Exchange in Friday?s trading after falling as low as $26.27 earlier in the session. 

 The decline accelerated after Standard amp; Poor?s cut Kodak?s bond ratings to junk status. The agency said Kodak no longer warrants an investment-grade rating, ?given the accelerated decline in its core consumer imaging business and the uncertain profit prospects of some of its emerging digital businesses.? Kodak bonds were down about two percentage points late in the day. 

 First-quarter revenue fell to $2.83 billion, short of analysts forecast of $2.91 billion. Excluding the benefit of the weak US dollar, which boosts the value of overseas sales when they are converted into dollars, revenue fell 5 per cent. 

 Digital revenue now represents about 46 per cent of the total at Kodak, as the company slims down to compete in a brutal digital photography market where low-cost Asian rivals dominate and margins are thin.

 Potion for tea gardens to take time

 S.P.S. PANNU

 Slow motion

 New Delhi, Nov. 18: The Rs 4,800-crore package to revive tea gardens is likely to be delayed as the Planning Commission has to vet the proposal after which it has to be approved by the finance ministry.

 Additional secretary Abhijit Sengupta, who is piloting the proposal for the commerce ministry, told The Telegraph the package has to be studied in detail by the Planning Commission as it was not part of the Tenth Five-Year Plan.

 ?It is difficult for me to say whether it will be cleared in the current fiscal. The commerce ministry has done 99 per cent of its job,? he added.

 He, however, added that the announcement of the proposal in this year?s budget would also weigh with the Planning Commission in pushing it through.

 ?It is a huge proposal and apart from the need to set up a special purpose vehicle to implement the financial package, various technical aspects such as the variety of tea bushes to be selected have to be decided. The plan has a 15-year perspective and, therefore, it cannot be rushed,? he added. 

 Commerce secretary S.N. Menon said a large portion of the package would be given as soft loans and the commerce ministry was working out the modalities with Nabard.

 ?Inter-ministerial discussions to clear the proposal are going on,? he added.

 The revival plan will focus on a huge replantation drive as the old age of the plants is pulling down productivity, resulting in a higher cost of production per hectare. 

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath has indicated that capital subsidy for replantation in old tea gardens is also on the cards. But the government also expects promoters to come up with their contribution to revive tea gardens.

 Experts feel that tea garden owners are also to blame. Poor garden management and excessive reliance on debt with negligible equity infusion have been major causes for a decline in the industry.

 According to the commerce ministry, around 50 per cent of the tea bushes in the country can be categorised as ?degraded?. This makes tea gardens in India less competitive than those in Sri Lanka and Kenya, which, along with Vietnam, have emerged as strong rivals in the international market. 

 The plan envisages replanting and rejuvenating 1.69 lakh hectares of tea gardens in the country over the next 15 years. The average cost for replanting has been worked out to Rs 2.5 lakh per hectare, while that for rejuvenation has been estimated at 0.65 lakh per hectare.

 In recent years, the domestic tea industry has been suffering from low levels of investment. The approved annual plan outlay for the industry during 2004-05 is only Rs 70 crore. In 2002-03 and 2003-04, funds worth Rs 112.3 crore were disbursed to the tea industry, of which only Rs 44.6 crore was allocated for productivity development.

 Since there has been a continuous decline in tea prices over the years because of excessive supply, the thrust of the revival plan is not so much on large volumes but on the quality of the produce.

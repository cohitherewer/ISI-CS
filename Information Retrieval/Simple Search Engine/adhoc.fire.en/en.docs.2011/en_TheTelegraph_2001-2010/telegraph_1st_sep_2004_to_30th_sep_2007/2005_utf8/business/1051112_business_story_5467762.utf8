 IDBI to recover bad assets in five years

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Nov. 11: Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) has worked out a five-year roadmap for recovery of sticky assets that have been transferred to the stressed asset stabilisation fund (SASF). 

 IDBI had transferred Rs 9,000 crore of its non-performing assets, including Rs 1,200 crore in Dabhol Power Company, to SASF. The recovery of NPAs will have an impact on the overall profitability of IDBI.

 SASF, a special purpose vehicle in the form of an asset management trust, was formed by the government to take over the sticky assets of IDBI after it was converted into a bank. 

 The central government has also accorded SASF the status of financial institution to enable it to access the debt tribunals for recovery of debts.

 I had a meeting with the officials of SASF only two days back. A deadline of five years has been set within which all the cases have to resolved and the SASF will be closed down, V.P. Shetty, chairman of IDBI, said. He was in Calcutta to attend Bancon 2005.

 SASF has been able to resolve cases worth Rs 4,600 crore. It made a cash recovery of Rs 600 crore from 227 cases. In some cases, we will sell the assets. We may also takeover certain accounts if we find them standard ones, Shetty said. 

 In the next five years, IDBI is looking at a recovery of nearly Rs 6,000 crore.

 Shetty also spoke about IDBIs foray into insurance. We will start a fresh due diligence on joint venture partners for the foray. The process has just begun and we will shortly appoint a consultant to scout for a partner, IDBI chairman said. 

 However, he refused to say whether any overseas insurance companies have already shown interest. Its too early to comment, he said. IDBI plans to enter the life insurance sector.

 IDBI is also mulling an asset management company for floating mutual funds. The management has decided to enter mutual funds. But nothing has been firmed up till date, he said.

 IDBI may also use IDBI Capital Market Services (ICMS) for foraying into mutual funds. ICMS has recently entered retail broking. It is a major player in its capacity as a primary dealer and is a member of Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange.

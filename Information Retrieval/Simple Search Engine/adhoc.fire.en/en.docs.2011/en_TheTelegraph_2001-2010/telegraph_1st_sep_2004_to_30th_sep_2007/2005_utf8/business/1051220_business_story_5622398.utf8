 Centre speeds up Maruti stake sale

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 19: The government today invited expressions of interest from public sector financial institutions and banks for selling an 8 per cent stake in Maruti Udyog, the countrys largest carmaker.

 The government, which holds a total of 18.28 per cent stake in Maruti, representing 5,28,24,020 shares, said it was open to divesting the entire stake on offer to a single bidder.

 The 8 per cent stake that the government will be selling represents 2,31,12,804 shares.

 Only public sector financial institutions and banks can bid. Asset management companies and mutual funds managed by these institutions are not eligible. 

 The minimum bid value is Rs 10 crore and a single institution can bid for all the shares on offer, officials said.

 However, the government has said the present FI holdings in Maruti and shares transferred from the government to them should not exceed 10 per cent of the companys equity on the date of such transfer.

 At the time of submission of bids, institutions have been asked to disclose their exact shareholding in the company. The shares will be issued with a lock-in period of six months. 

 The last date for submitting the expressions of interest (EoI) is January 4. After the EoIs are submitted, the shortlisted institutions will be asked to submit the financial bids.

 Taking into account the current price of Marutis scrip on stock exchanges, the government can raise around Rs 1,500 crore from the sale.

 SBI Capital Markets and Kotak Mahindra Capital have been appointed lead advisers to the government on the transaction. Earlier this year, the cabinet committee on economic affairs had approved the stake sale.

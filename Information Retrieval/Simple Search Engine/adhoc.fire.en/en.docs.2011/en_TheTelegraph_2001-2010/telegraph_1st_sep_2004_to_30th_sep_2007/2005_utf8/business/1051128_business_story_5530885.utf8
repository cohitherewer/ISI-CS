 Automation set to boom

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 27: Propelled by the demand from a booming manufacturing sector, the Indian automation industry is set to achieve a 20-25 per cent annual growth rate in the coming years. 

 Currently, the domestic automation industry is dominated by multinationals and the market size is estimated at Rs 4,000 crore annually, said Ravi Uppal, president of the Automation Industry of India (AIA). 

 Uppal was speaking at the Metal Tech 2005 organised in the city recently. He said the metal sector was expected to contribute handsomely to the growth of the automation industry, as most of the large manufacturers in this sector have already announced massive expansion plans.

 Uppal, who is also the vice-chairman and managing director of ABB India, pointed out that the Indian automation industry could sustain the high growth rate since penetration was still very low. In comparison, the Chinese automation market is estimated at Rs 35,000 crore ? six times larger than India.

 With Indias gradual integration with the world economy, automation would play an important role in bringing down the costs, Uppal said. Costs apart, automation would also help in increasing productivity, efficiency, aesthetics and delivery systems, he added. 

 Allaying fears of the user industry about spiralling costs, he said the industry must invest in best technology to get the most benefit out of automation.

 Given the opportunities in India, a number of global majors, such as Honeywell, have set up a development hub for automation products. The industry is now employing about 10,000 people.

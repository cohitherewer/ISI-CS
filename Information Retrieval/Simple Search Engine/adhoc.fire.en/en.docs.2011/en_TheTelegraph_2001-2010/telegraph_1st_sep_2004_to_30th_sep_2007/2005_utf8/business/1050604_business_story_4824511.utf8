 Balmer net profit rises 61%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 3: Balmer Lawrie has made a net profit of Rs 29.83 crore for the financial year ended March 31, 2005, which is 61 per cent higher than the corresponding figure of the previous year.

 The turnover of the public sector company went up by 8 per cent to cross the Rs 1,000-crore mark. The board of directors has cleared a dividend of 55 per cent, up from 35 per cent in the previous year. Earning per share increased to Rs 18.31 from Rs 11.41 in the previous year.

 The higher profit of the company is attributed to significantly higher contributions from its logistics management and container freight station activities and the improved performance of its travel and tours and leather chemicals businesses. The industrial packaging unit of the company has also shown a turnaround.

 The company, which was on the selloff list of the Vajpayee-led government, is now drawing up a five-year strategic plan focusing on long-term growth.

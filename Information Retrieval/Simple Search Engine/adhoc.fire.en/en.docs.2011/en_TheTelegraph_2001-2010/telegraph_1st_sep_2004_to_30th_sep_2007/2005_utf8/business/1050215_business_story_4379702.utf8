 Move to boost textile exports

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 14: Textile exporters are looking at new ways to step up exports in the post-quota regime.

 The Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (Texprocil) has commissioned Dun amp; Bradstreet to conduct studies in 11 strategic markets, which constitute around 50 per cent of the total exports from India. 

 These include markets in the US, Italy, the UK, Germany, France, Brazil, the UAE, Bangladesh, Japan, China-Hong Kong and Mauritius.

 According to the council, higher competition on account of falling prices and demand for better quality and services require a more aggressive strategy in the international market.

 The council said this initiative is part of a series of export-promotion activities to facilitate a credible transition of textile trade in the post-quota regime.

 A Texprocil official said the markets under study import around $11.1 billion worth of cotton textiles, accounting for more than 25 per cent of its global import valued at $43.3 billion during 2003. 

 The study intends to cover key parameters of trade in these markets and provide exhaustive analytical overviews of the structure of the textile industry, volume and origin of imports, export profile, import policies, including tariff and non-tariff barriers and profiles of leading buyers. 

 The project is under the Market Access Initiative Scheme of the commerce ministry. While the council has already received reports on five markets, these will be released later this week.

 Texprocil officials expect that the findings of these reports would help domestic exporters to redesign their strategies in seeking new growth areas and emerging opportunities. 

 In addition to these markets, Texprocil has identified 20 more markets for intensive study during the next two years.

 As part of its ongoing export promotion programmes, the council proposes to survey around 35-40 markets, which constitute more than 80 per cent of India?s cotton textile exports.

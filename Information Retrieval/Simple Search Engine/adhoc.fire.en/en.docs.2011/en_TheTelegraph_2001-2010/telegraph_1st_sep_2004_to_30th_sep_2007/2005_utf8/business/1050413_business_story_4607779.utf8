 Posco project hits a roadblock

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, April 12: The Posco project in Orissa seems to have been derailed after the talks between the Korean steel major and the state government yesterday failed to resolve the contentious issue of iron ore rights. 

 Posco had hoped to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Orissa government on April 14, but it seems unlikely at the moment. In the initial phase, Posco was to set up a 3-million-tonne facility by 2009, which would be upgraded to 12 million tonnes in another eight years. Posco produces around 26 million tonnes of steel products each year, enough to produce about 100,000 compact cars a day. 

 The Posco delegation accused the Orissa government of changing its conditions too often. Though Posco is still in talks with the state government for the 12-million-metric-tonne capacity, iron ore allocation was the main stumbling block. While Posco asked the state government for mining rights on 600 million tonnes of iron ore for 30 years and 400 million tonnes for a long-term supply contract, no compromise has been reached as yet. ?Posco wants the mining lease for the whole capacity by which the excess ore can be shipped out without any value addition,? said a source. 

 The Orissa government?s difficulties on iron ore rights stem from opposition from several quarters, including its own MPs. Former steel minister and senior BJD leader B. K. Tripathy has alleged that the Posco deal would be against the interest of the state. Though chief minister Naveen Patnaik has assured that there would be no compromise on the state?s interest, there are few takers.

 AIG hires Levitt to pacify investors

 JENNY ANDERSON

 Comfort factor 

 New York, July 6: American 

 International Group (AIG), the number two in the US general 

 and life insurance market, has hired Arthur Levitt, a former 

 Securities amp; Exchange Commission chairman, as a consultant 

 to the board in an effort to quell dissent from institutional 

 investors.

 Levitt will help evaluate potential 

 nominees to the board and advise on corporate governance 

 issues. 

 The appointment of Levitt is the 

 latest step taken by the AIG board to repair the insurers 

 reputation in the face of state and federal investigations. 

 The New York attorney general and the New York insurance 

 department have sued the company and its former top two 

 executives, accusing them of manipulating financial statements 

 and misleading regulators. 

 At the same time, a New York grand 

 jury has been convened to weigh criminal charges against 

 individuals in the AIG case. The justice department and 

 the Securities amp; Exchange Commission are also investigating. 

 While the board has been praised 

 by regulators for moving quickly to force out its chairman-cum-chief 

 executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, it has also been criticised 

 for not being vigilant and independent enough for years 

 under Greenberg.

 We think its a hopeful 

 development, said Pat Macht, a spokeswoman for the 

 California Public Employees Retirement System, an 

 US pension fund known as Calpers, about Levitts appointment. 

 Its no secret, we think AIGs top order 

 of business is a top-level review of corporate governance. 

 In April, the Calpers announced 

 that AIG was at the top of its focus list of 

 poor financial and corporate governance performers. The 

 pension funds investment in AIG cost Calpers $240 

 million in losses, according to an April 20 disclosure. 

 AIGs stock price has plunged 

 19 per cent since the company disclosed that it had received 

 subpoenas from the SEC and the New York attorney general 

 on February 14.

 Plan allocation for power, roads hiked 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 21: An additional plan allocation of Rs 825 crore for power and road development and maintenance in the budget for 2005-06 by Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta shows the government?s seriousness in improving infrastructure.

 An additional Rs 395 crore has been allocated for construction and improvement of roads and bridges in the next fiscal. A ?special priority? status has been given to the power sector, which received an additional fund of Rs 530 crore.

 While the allocation for the road sector was increased to 784 crore from Rs 419 crore, outlay for the power sector rose to Rs 2,089 crore from Rs 1,559 crore.

 Realising the poor road condition of the state, Dasgupta said, ?Improvement of infrastructure is essential to increase production and generate employment in industries and agriculture. In this regard, the development and maintenance of roads is most urgent.?

 The finance minister has also broken up the allocation on the road sector under three heads. He has set aside Rs 550 crore for construction and maintenance of roads and bridges; Rs 140 crore for normal maintenance and Rs 194 crore for improved maintenance.

 Dasgupta also proposed the introduction of co-ordination and joint monitoring system for the roads in the districts by the public works departments and panchayats.

 According to Dasgupta, the steps taken by the government through its own power utilities in Bakreswar, Sagardighi, Santaldihi and Durgapur will result in an additional capacity of 1570 MW in the next two years.

 A special rural electrification programme has also been taken up to ensure 100 per cent coverage by 2006-07 from 85 per cent at present.

 The higher allocation for the power sector also reflects the finance minister?s confidence on the West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB), which has been consistently showing improved revenue earning. The earnings are expected to reach Rs 5,000 crore at the end of this fiscal. The WBSEB?s income increased by 43 per cent to Rs 4,269 crore in 2003-04 from Rs 2,979 crore in the previous fiscal. The power generating outfits in the state increased their plant load factor to 60 per cent in the current year from 53.2 per cent last year.

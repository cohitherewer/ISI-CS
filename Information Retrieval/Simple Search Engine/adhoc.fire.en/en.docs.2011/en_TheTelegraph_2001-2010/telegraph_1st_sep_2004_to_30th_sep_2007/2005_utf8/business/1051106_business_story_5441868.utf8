 Global trade talks enter make-or-break lap

 Mandelson: Crucial role

 Geneva, Nov. 5 (Reuters): World trade negotiators face stark choices next week with years of haggling over a hoped-for shake-up in global rules to boost economies and give a better deal for poor states riding on the outcome.

 With just over a month to go to a show-down in Hong Kong, ministers from a clutch of key World Trade Organisation (WTO) members will make what could be a final bid to narrow yawning differences in key areas, most notably agriculture.

 I always hesitate to use the term make or break, but I think next week will determine whether we can get into the position of making Hong Kong a success or not, said European Union trade commissioner Peter Mandelson.

 The European Union is under pressure for further concessions on farm tariffs, with New Zealands Trade Minister Jim Sutton warning that if Brussels does not move, the WTOs Doha Development Agenda, the official name, could collapse.

 If that is literally their final offer, that is the end of the Doha negotiations, he told Reuters in Hong Kong.

 But Mandelson, caught between the farm goods exporting nations and European states such as France which oppose giving more ground, wants to shift the focus to services and manufacturing, where poorer states are being asked to do more.

 Next week we must ... start looking at the whole picture and working across the range of our negotiations. There is clearly a need for compromise and sacrifice by all, he said on Friday after talks with Chinas commerce minister Bo Xilai.

 Launched in the Qatari capital in late 2001, with the world still reeling from the September 11 attacks, the trade round aims to slash rich nation farm subsidies, open up markets from farm produce to industrial goods and services and crack other types of barriers such as anti-dumping actions.

 Detailed draft

 The WTO wants a detailed draft deal to be agreed at a ministerial meeting in Hong Kong in mid-December.

 Estimates for the benefits for the world economy range from the tens to the hundreds of billions of dollars, with the biggest impact from a successful round coming in agriculture.

 This is where developing countries have most to gain and developed nations such as those of the EU most to lose, hence the intense focus on farm issues.

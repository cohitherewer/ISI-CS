 Tata Chem net profit jumps to Rs 97 cr 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 18: Tata Chemicals has posted a 63 per cent rise in net profit to Rs 96.59 crore for the third quarter ended December 31 from Rs 59.15 crore in the corresponding period last year.

 Total income (net of excise) of the company has increased to Rs 1090.83 crore from Rs 777.61 crore in the year-ago period.

 Tata Chemicals, which manufactures chemicals, fertilisers, food additives and synthetic soda ash, said in inorganic chemicals, the demand outlook for the soda ash business, particularly from the glass segment, remains strong both locally and globally. 

 On the back of this demand, as well as spiralling raw material and freight costs, prices of soda ash were firmed up in November 2004 in select markets by approximately 7 per cent, it added.

 While the company is looking at increasing its presence in the food additives business, it said a good Rabi season is expected to result in continued healthy demand for nitrogenous and complex fertilisers though some purchases may have been made in advance.

 ?The revised phosphoric acid price that the government and industry have negotiated can be expected to provide some relief to the complex fertiliser business. However, ammonia prices remain strong,? it added.

 Regarding the performance for the third quarter, managing director Prasad Menon said it was a result of improved sales volumes and efficiency enhancement across the company?s businesses.

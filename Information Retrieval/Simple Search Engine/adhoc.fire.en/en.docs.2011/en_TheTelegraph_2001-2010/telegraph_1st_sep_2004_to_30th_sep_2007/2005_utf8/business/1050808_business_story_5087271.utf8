 Women at risk

 Insurers don?t do enough to target the fairer sex. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay finds out why

 RP Sinha has been scouting for a life insurance plan for his two unmarried daughters that will benefit them even after their marriages. His search turned up just three from a dozen life insurers in the country.

 The question is: Do women need exclusive plans for them?

 Sex does matter when it comes to purchasing life insurance policies. Women are exposed to certain life risks that men do not face such as giving birth to a child. A common life insurance policy won?t cover the life of a pregnant woman; nor will it cover critical illness arising out of woman-specific diseases. Women, however, certainly have an edge over their male counterparts as they generally live longer than men. In other words, its riskier for a life insurance company to insure the life of a man. 

 This is the reason why the insurance companies charge a 10 to 20 per cent lower premium for women than men in the same age group and profile for almost all of their plans. 

 But there?s an irony in all this: there aren?t too many life insurance plans that are targeted solely at women and, second, the preferential premium rates havent been able to raise the ranks of insured women who constitute less than 20 per cent of the countrys total insured population! 

 Vital stats

 The latest census data reveals that while the countrys total population grew at the annual rate of 1.55 per cent over 1991-2001, the female population grew 21.79 per cent against 20.93 per cent growth of the male population. Women?s life expectancy is also higher at 63.53 years than the 62.22 years for men. The number of females per 1,000 males (sex ratio) at the end of the decade also increased to 933 from 927 in the previous decade. 

 Another interesting aspect of the national population figure is that except for a few states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and parts of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, the sex ratio in most other states is over 933. 

 Girls? only

 The insurers have tended to ignore the statistics and haven?t really gone after the women whose share in the country?s working population has also dramatically increased over the last 10 years. Two years ago, Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), the country?s largest life insurer, withdrew its best plan for the girl child, Jeevan Sukanya. ?LIC simply failed to market this fantastic product in right earnest at least in the urban areas,? says a former LIC official. ?Prior to nationalisation of life insurance in 1958, private insurance companies used to offer insurance to female lives with some extra premium or on restrictive conditions. After nationalisation, while women with incomes are treated on a par with male lives at present, a restrictive clause is imposed if she is within 30 years and doesnt have an income.?

 On offer now

 LIC has now launched Jeevan Sneha, coinciding with the International Year of Women. It also has another woman-specific plan, Jeevan Bharti. Each of these plans work like a combination of a money-back plan and a limited-term endowment plan. However, the premium rates for these plans are higher than that of a common money-back plan. 

 Under both the plans, the life insured continues to get the life cover for a maximum of three years for non-payment of premium. In both the cases, the policy will not be available to women who already have children with congenital disability. The policy has to be in force for a minimum of six months in the case of critical illness and one year in case of the birth of a child with congenital disabilities.

 First of its kind

 Birla Sun Life Insurance Company has a unit-linked plan called Women First Plan. This plan comes with a guaranteed addition of 3 per cent and, like a money-back policy, a certain amount from the accrued fund value is transferred to a holders account at regular intervals from where the policyholder can withdraw money as and when required. 

 Setting riders 

 Some insurers are offering riders for women in their common plans.

 Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance is the latest to launch such a rider, called Mahila Gain. However, since the premiums the women pay for a given policy are lower than what men of the same age pay, a good option would be to buy a pure term assurance cover with a critical illness rider that is dedicated to women. 

 Under a term assurance, one can go in for a comparatively higher sum assured at a low premium. But check out the fine print on critical illness riders for different companies. They do vary a lot in terms of the reimbursement for illnesses: if someone pays 20 per cent of the sum assured for a reconstructive surgery in breast cancer, others give 10 per cent. Otherwise, almost all insurers charge a lower rate from women than men.

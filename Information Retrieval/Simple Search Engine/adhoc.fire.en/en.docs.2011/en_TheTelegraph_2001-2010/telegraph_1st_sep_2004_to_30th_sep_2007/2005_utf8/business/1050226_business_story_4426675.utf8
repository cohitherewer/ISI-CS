 High imports fuel trade deficit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 25: The record trade deficit in the first half of 2004-05 due to a surge in the country?s imports is likely to produce a current account deficit this fiscal after three consecutive years of surplus, according to the Economic Survey.

 The survey attributes the rise in imports to a buoyant domestic economy, but the sharp increase in international crude oil prices is also a significant factor contributing to the spiralling import bill.

 However, the survey plays down the impact of the trade deficit on the economy by saying the outlook for balance of payments appears reasonably strong and resilient.

 It goes on to say that the ?growing strength of Indias external sector provides the enabling conditions to accelerate the pace of external liberalisation.? 

 The survey is of the view that given the global reach and marketing ability of FDI, export promotion policy further needs to utilise the natural complementarity of FDI with export activity.

 It states that the countrys external sector is likely to benefit from the sustained momentum of manufacturing activity. It expects the continued robust growth of exports of merchandise and services to absorb additional imports. 

 On the negative side, the survey points out that ?after last years robust pace, global growth and world trade are projected to increase at slower rates in 2005? but sticks to an optimistic note by adding that the growth will still be impressive. 

 It also highlights the fact that recent activity indicators show some uncertainty surrounding the strengthening of global economic recovery. 

 ?Global imbalances and their potential to have a disruptive impact on currency markets, hardening of interest rates, volatility in crude oil prices and uncertain prospects of soft landing of Chinas economy continue to be some of the major uncertainties and risks facing the global economy, it adds.

 ?Notwithstanding such international environmental factors, Indias external sector is expected to remain a source of strength providing comfort to the conduct of its macroeconomic policies,? the survey states.

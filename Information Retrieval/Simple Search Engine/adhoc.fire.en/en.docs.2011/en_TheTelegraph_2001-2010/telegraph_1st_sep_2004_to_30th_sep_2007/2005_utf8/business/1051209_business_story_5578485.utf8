 Power policy shocker

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 8: Bengal has opposed the draft national tariff policy amid signals it would ask the state regulator to toss out the proposals in the interest of consumers.

 The state is unhappy with the way cross-subsidy surcharge will be calculated if the draft is accepted in its present form. It is also not comfortable with the requirement for mandatory competitive bidding in all new private power projects and the plan to abolish advance against depreciation. 

 The government feels the three provisions will hurt consumers and choke fresh investments.

 The draft policy provides for elimination of cross-subsidy in one go. The method of computing it is such that low-end consumers will bear the burden even as high-end users pay less. This is not in conformity with the Electricity Act 2003, Bengal power minister Mrinal Banerjee said.

 The minister pointed out that the formula agreed to earlier envisaged a gradual elimination of subsidies. 

 The electricity act gives distribution firms the option to purchase power either through a regulated process or competitive bidding ? the latter cannot be foisted on firms.

 LG focus on infotech 

 M. RAJENDRAN

 New Delhi, July 18: LG India is fine tuning a strategy to increase its market share in IT products and earn a revenue of $250 million by March 2006.

 When LG entered the desktop market, the company had identified a clear opportunity. During early 2004, there was a shift from assembled PCs towards the branded ones. The market was transforming and there was an increased consumers awareness, said R. Manikandan, general manager sales and marketing for IT products at LG Electronics India Pvt Ltd. 

 This year, LG is targeting a $2.04-billion revenue from India. Of this, 12 per cent would come from personal computers business, he said, adding that the share of PC business is increasing every year. LG enjoyed a 10 per cent market share in 2004.

 In an effort to avoid a conflict with sellers of assembled PCs, LG has sold PCs through its system-assembler partners. The company claimed that the strategy has benefited. 

 LG is marketing desktops through its consumer electronics retail outlets. It is planning to open a chain of exclusive stores for IT products. 

 Currently, there are 32 LG Cyber Shoppes in the country, which will increase to 100 by the year-end. 

 According to an industry analyst, Though these retail counters have not generated higher sales initially, they have helped in establishing the LG brand of desktops. The company will be able to exploit this brand image through the specialised outlets.

 According to IDC, in the third quarter of 2004, LG has managed to grab about 6.4 per cent share of the consumer desktop market, leaving Zenith behind at around 5 per cent. It maintained a similar market share in the subsequent quarter.

 The IDC report on the first quarter of 2005 has stated that LG is the only company, which has registered a sequential growth in the consumer-desktop segment in the domestic market. In a declining market, LG has recorded a 22 per cent sequential growth, and grew its market share from 6 per cent to 8 per cent.

 CalTel broadband bait to buy user loyalty

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 18: Calcutta Telephones (CalTel) is banking on its DataOne broadband services to keep landline subscribers hooked to its own network. 

 We need one lakh broadband subscribers by March next year. At present, we have only 13,500 users, though the capacity is for 45,000 users. We have introduced a new scheme for entry-level users with a monthly rental of Rs 250. However, the download limit has been restricted to 0.4 GB, said S. K. Bhaduri, general manager, customer relations, CalTel, 

 According to Bhaduri, an user downloads 1 GB of data for 30 hours of Internet use every month. 

 The price of the modem has also been reduced to Rs 1200 from Rs 2000, he added.

 The new scheme will be available till the end of this month. Users will also get an additional 200 calls free over and above the free calls in their existing tariff plan for the next three months. An user can also download free of cost between 2 am and 8 am. 

 Since broadband growth is directly related to PC penetration, we have also tied up with HCL and Amar PC for bundled offers, Bhaduri said. 

 The company is scaling up its support services for broadband and may consider outsourcing as the user base grows.

 CalTel is also taking steps to restrict the slide in landline subscription and has introduced two new schemes for its low-end and high-end users.

 Around 35,000 connections have been surrendered during the current fiscal, while registrations per month are between 4000 and 5000.

 The Liberty Plan with a monthly rental of Rs 799 for high-end users will allow unlimited calls within the BSNL network ? landline, mobile and WLL ? across the state. Existing customers can migrate to this plan free of cost, said Bhaduri. Calls to other networks will be charged at existing rates. Around 35 per cent of the current 13.5 lakh landline users are high-end subscribers.

 The second Plan Abhinava with a monthly rental of Rs 240 will have 200 calls free for the first six months and 60 calls free thereafter. Calls beyond 200 units will get discounts, he added.

 Calcutta, Feb. 3: Power may be dearer by one paise per unit to promote clean generation.

 The Bengal power department will soon approach the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission to impose a cess of one paise per unit so that more funds are available for non-conventional energy generation.

 ?Around Rs 30 crore could be raised from the cess. The entire kitty would be spent to encourage industry and rope in new entrepreneurs from the private sector for power generation through renewable and non-conventional resources,? Bengal power minister Mrinal Banerjee said while inaugurating a workshop on clean development mechanism (CDM) for managers in the iron and steel sector in the east.

 At present, about 30 MW of power is generated in the state through primary solar photo-voltaic system in the Sunderbans, wind power and mini hydel projects. The state plans to increase power generation to 150 MW in the coming years for which the proposed fund through additional cess would be useful.

 The state provides Rs 4 crore to promote non-conventional power generation, which is disbursed through the West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Authority. The state also gets a Central assistance of Rs 25 crore.

 The workshop sought to bring about the awareness of the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which is to take effect from February 19, and how the developing countries could profit from it. Pamposh Bhat, head of CDM India, explained that a Rs 10,000-crore international carbon trading market would be created for the third world. 

 Under the Kyoto protocol, six greenhouse gasses, whose emission is considered for abatement are carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydro fluoro carbons, per fluoro carbons and sulphur hexa fluoride.

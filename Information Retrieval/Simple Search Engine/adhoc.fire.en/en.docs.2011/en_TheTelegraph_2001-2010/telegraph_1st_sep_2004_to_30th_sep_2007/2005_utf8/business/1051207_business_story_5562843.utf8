 IFC, private banks in stake talks

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Dec. 6: The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is keen to pick up stakes in Indian private sector banks to enable them to meet Basel-II deadline for capital requirement.

 The multilateral funding agency is already in talks with private banks for buying minority stakes. These are Lord Krishna Bank, Lakshmi Vilas Bank, Dhanalakshmi Bank, Catholic Syrian Bank and Ganesh Bank of Kurundwad.

 According to banking experts, IFC can pick up minority stakes in Indian banks to give them more headroom for capital, the requirement of which will increase with the implementation of Basel-II norms.

 Local banks also need to streamline their risk management systems and corporate governance to compete with foreign banks when the domestic market opens up for more entities.

 These banks may not go to the market in a big way to mop up funds. They will prefer bringing in partners, who will acquire minority stakes in the bank and generate the capital necessary to maintain the adequacy ratio in the Basel-II regime, bankers said.

 According to the Reserve Bank of India guidelines, a multilateral agency like IFC can buy up to 10 per cent stake in a private sector bank. A foreign bank with Indian operations cannot buy more than 5 per cent stake in a private bank. However, a foreign bank with no operations in India can buy up to 10 per cent stake in a private sector bank. 

 IFC currently has a 5 per cent stake in ING Vysya Bank. It also has equity stakes in Centurion Bank and SBI Capital Markets. The World Bank group entity also had a stake in the failed Global Trust Bank. 

 At $1.3 billion, India is the third largest recipient of financial assistance by IFC. The funding agencys largest exposure is in Brazil at $1.6 billion, followed by Russia at $1.5 billion.

 With the Basel-II norms round the corner, banking is gradually emerging as a major area of investment for IFC, sources said.

 Since 1956, IFC has invested in 153 companies in India, providing nearly $2.8 billion in financing for its own account and $525 million for the accounts of participants in IFCs loan syndication programme. 

 IFCs portfolio of $1.2 billion (as on March 2005) makes India its third largest country of operations. In recent years, IFC has grown its business substantially with new commitments reaching $284 million in 2004.

 Sebi nod for Holcim offer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 17: Holcim?s twin open offers to the shareholders of Associated Cement Companies (ACC) and Ambuja Cement Eastern have received the green signal from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today.

 ACC will officially get a promoter once the open offer sails through.

 An open offer was due after Swiss cement major Holcim made its foray into India by acquiring a significant stake in ACC, which has a production capacity of 20 million tonnes. 

 Holcim also entered into an alliance with Gujarat Ambuja Ltd. It completed a complicated three-step deal to acquire the American Insurance Group and Government of Singapore Investment Company?s 40 per cent shareholding in Ambuja Cement India Ltd (ACIL). ACIL is the holding company that owns 13.8 per cent of the 18.2-million-tonne ACC Ltd and also owns a 94 per cent stake in Ambuja Eastern Ltd, a cement maker with a 2-million-tonne capacity.

 Sebi?s clearance will entail Holcim to garner up to 50.1 per cent in ACC and nearly 6 per cent in Ambuja Cement Eastern.

 It is believed that Life Insurance Corporation will seriously consider the open offer to at least sell a portion of its holding and book profits.

 The ACC open offer is priced at Rs 370 a share and was scheduled to begin on March 10 and end on March 30. The delay in obtaining an approval from Sebi resulted in a delay of more than a week. Holcim is making this open offer along with Gujarat Ambuja Cements, through an investment company, Ambuja Cement India. ACIL currently holds 13.4 per cent in ACC.

 According to the deal between Holcim and Gujarat Ambuja, the Swiss major will acquire a 67 per cent stake in ACIL, while the Indian company will hold the remaining 37 per cent.

 DSP Merrill Lynch is the lead manager to the open offer.

 As a direct fallout of the rescheduling of the open offer, another open offer on behalf of Accurate Finstock Pvt Ltd and Adani Port Infrastructure Ltd to Everest India Ltd (EIL) was delayed.

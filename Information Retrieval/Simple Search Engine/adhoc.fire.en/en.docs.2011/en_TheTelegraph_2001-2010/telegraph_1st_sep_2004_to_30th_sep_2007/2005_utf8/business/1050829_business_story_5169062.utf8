 Kotak to map Gesco business revamp

 Mumbai, Aug. 28 (PTI): Kotak Securities Ltd will advise the Sheths on the proposed realignment of Great Eastern Shipping Co Ltd (GE Shipping). A board meeting has been convened on August 31 to discuss the matter.

 The company has appointed Kotak Securities to carry out the valuation of the business and advise on its proposed realignment, a senior official of GE Shipping said today.

 Kotak Securities, an affiliate of Kotak Mahindra Bank, is the stock brokerage company and the distribution arm of the Kotak Mahindra Group.

 The Mumbai-based Sheth family, promoters of GE Shipping, has been contemplating realigning the shipping and offshore businesses and family assets between Bharat Sheth and his cousin Vijay Sheth following the demise of Sudhir Mulji last month. 

 After the death of Mulji, Bharat was elevated to the post of deputy chairman. He is now the vice-chairman and managing director. Vijay was also promoted to the position of managing director a few years ago.

 The proposed realignment would mean dividing the responsibilities of shipping and offshore businesses of GE Shipping between Bharat and Vijay, the official said.

 While Bharat was given the reins of the mainstay shipping business, Vijay got the offshore business. 

 Both its shipping and offshore businesses have reached maturity. It is always better to assign jobs separately so that they can focus more on their respective lines, he added. 

 But as shipping was the flagship business, it attracted more investments and contributed the largest share in building assets over the years. Kotak Securities has been hired to outline the broad contour of the division of businesses and assets.

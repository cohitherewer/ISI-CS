 Central Bank ups rates on deposits

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 12: Central Bank of India today raised interest rates on term deposits of more than three years by 50-75 basis points. Money kept with the bank for over three years to five years will now fetch 6.25 per cent, up from 5.75 per cent. Deposits of over five years will yield 6.25 per cent compared with 5.50 per cent earlier. Floating rates stay unchanged.

 Senior citizens will get 0.50 per cent more than the new rates; it will be a percentage point more for those above 70.

 Central Banks revision could trigger a similar increase in the rates of other nationalised banks, though bank watchers say they do not see immediate changes.

 A senior bank official said rates on the two types of deposits have been brought on a par with those offered by others. The Mumbai-based bank had raised rates in November last year, but left five-year deposits out of the realignment.

 We realised that our rates in the two categories were serving as a disincentive for depositors, the official said, adding the hike would help the bank raise the resources it needs to step up loans in a strong economy.

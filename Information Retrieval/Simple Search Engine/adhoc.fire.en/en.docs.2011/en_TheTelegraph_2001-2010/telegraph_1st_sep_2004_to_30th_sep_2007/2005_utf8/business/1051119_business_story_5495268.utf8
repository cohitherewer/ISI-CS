 Calcutta, Nov. 18: Shalimar Paints Ltd is planning to tie up with global players in niche areas of industrial paints.

 We have been approached by several international paint companies for tie-ups in the industrial paints segment, be it in the form of technical or marketing agreements or joint ventures, said S.L. Agarwal, managing director of Shalimar Paints.

 We are growing fast in this segment as there are few players, better margins and it is highly technology driven, Agarwal added.

 Shalimar has already entered into a marketing agreement with a European company for wood-finished paints. With this tie-up, we will venture into the wood-finish business, which is one of the fastest growing segments, he said.

 Chief operating officer Sandeep Sarda said, We have test marketed the product and have received an encouraging response. We will announce the tie-up in the next 15-20 days. The company will market these products in India and the neighbouring countries. 

 Shalimar has recently entered into a technical agreement with Kunsul Chemical Industries Co Ltd of Korea in pre-coated metal coatings. The tie-up is for both architectural structures and appliances.

 Shalimar Paints is setting up a greenfield project near Bangalore to capture the southern market.

 We will invest Rs 15 crore in two phases for the plant. In the first phase, the plant will have a capacity of 1,000 kl per month, which will be operational by December 2006. In the second phase, we will expand the capacity by 800 kl per month by December 2007, Sarda said.

 The company will finance the investments through a mix of internal accruals and debt in the ratio of 60:40, he added. 

 Shalimar is planning an image makeover. For this, it is preparing a brand strategy, which includes a dynamic marketing plan. 

 Apart from completely revamping the packaging of its products, Shalimar is trying innovative marketing strategies. We have appointed Tritan for the exercise and will spend around Rs 3-4 crore in phases on this, Agarwal said.

 Shalimar Paints is expecting a revenue growth of 20-25 per cent this year over Rs 225 crore earned last year.

 The company is still exploring options for inorganic growth. Though there are hardly any big players left in the market for acquisition, there are small players who operate in niche segments. We might consider such options at the right value, Sarda said.

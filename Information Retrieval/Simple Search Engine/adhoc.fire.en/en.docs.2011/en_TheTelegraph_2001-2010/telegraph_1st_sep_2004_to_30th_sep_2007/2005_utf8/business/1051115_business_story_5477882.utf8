 Opec to chart policy after winter sets in

 Kuwait, Nov. 14 (Reuters): The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) is waiting for cold winter weather to set in before it charts oil supply policy for early next year, but for now sees no need to cut output, the producer groups president said today.

 The cartel basket price has sunk close to $50 a barrel, a level some members wish to defend, as swelling fuel stocks and milder-than-normal weather ease fears of tight supplies.

 We have to wait, still the winter has not started. For that, we have to follow the prices and Opec, they dont have a target for the prices, said Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah, also Kuwaiti oil minister. Until now, we dont have any plans to cut production, he added.

 US energy secretary Sam Bodman, on a tour of West Asian producers, called on Opec at the weekend to keep pumping at its highest rate in 25 years to keep markets amply supplied.

 I would hope that the (Opec) ministers would see fit to continue supplying the market, Bodman said.

 Washingtons own calculations show Opec would have no need to curb supplies.

 I think our view is the market needs to continue to be adequately supplied, Guy Caruso of the US governments Energy Information Administration said on Sunday. There is a lot of uncertainty about demand and, therefore, its best to let the market determine how much it wants to take up.

 Signalling that production cuts were not immediately on the horizon, the worlds top oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, on Monday told customers in Asia and Europe it would hold crude shipments in December steady versus this month.

 Opec agreed to offer all its spare capacity from October 1 for three months ? but there were no takers.

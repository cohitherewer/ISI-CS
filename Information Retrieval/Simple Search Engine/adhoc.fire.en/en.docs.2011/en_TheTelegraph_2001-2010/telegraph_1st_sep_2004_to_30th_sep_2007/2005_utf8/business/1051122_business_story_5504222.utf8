 Todi: New plans

 Calcutta, Nov. 21: Shrachi Securities has mandated KPMG as its consultant to study the future roadmap.

 We are witnessing a significant growth in our business and realise that the growth has to be in a controllable manner and on a sustained basis, said Ravi Todi, managing director of Shrachi Securities.

 We have appointed KPMG as our consultant a month back to study our business processes and help us increase revenues and sustain growth, said Todi. KPMG is expected to submit the report by the month-end.

 We are exploring various business options and planning to leverage our infrastructure for the purpose, said Todi. At present, the company has 60 branches, while its manpower is 650.

 The company is also looking at tie-ups with other banks and is currently in talks with some, said Todi. At present, Shrachi has a tie-up with Citibank and HDFC Bank.

 We are working out the modalities and such agreements should be finalised by December, he added.

 Shrachi also plans to issue additional capital through the rights issue or preferential allotment route. We are talking to few financial institutions and a decision will be taken in 15-20 days, said Todi.

 The company recently issued 19 lakh warrants convertible to equity shares at Rs 53 apiece on a preferential basis.

 The company has reported a 30 per cent growth in its total income at Rs 8.08 crore against Rs 6.22 crore achieved during the same period last fiscal. The net profit was Rs 2.35 crore against Rs 1.75 crore achieved during the same period of the previous year.

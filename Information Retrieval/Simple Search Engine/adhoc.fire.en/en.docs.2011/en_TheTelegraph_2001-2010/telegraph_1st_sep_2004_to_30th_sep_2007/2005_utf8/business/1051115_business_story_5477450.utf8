 Focus on Internet flexibility

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: India will support flexibility and transparency in Internet governance at the second phase of the World Summit on Information Society (WSIS) scheduled to start on Wednesday at Tunis, Tunisia.

 IT and communications minister Dayanidhi Maran will extend support for an open architecture of Internet governance that will be stable and reflect the aspiration of different stakeholders, including governments.

 The International Telecommunication Union, following a proposal by the government of Tunisia, resolved at its Plenipotentiary Conference in Minneapolis in 1998 to hold a World Summit on Information Society and placed it on the agenda of the United Nations. The WSIS aims to find solutions to issues emerging from digital revolution and digital divide in the world.

 Maran is leading a high-level delegation to WSIS. Telecom Commission chairman J.S. Sarma will accompany the minister along with other senior officials of the departments of telecommunications and information technology. Nasscom president Kiran Karnik will also be part of the team.

 The summit is being held in two phases. The first phase took place in Geneva in December 2003, where 175 countries adopted a declaration of principles and plan of action.

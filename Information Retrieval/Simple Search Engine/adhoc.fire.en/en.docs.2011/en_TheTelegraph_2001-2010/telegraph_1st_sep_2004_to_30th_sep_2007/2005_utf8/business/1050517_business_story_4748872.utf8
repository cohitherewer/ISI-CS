 Telefonica earnings up

 Dial for cash 

 Madrid, May 16 (Reuters): Spanish telecom giant Telefonica has posted a 36 per cent rise in first-quarter net profit thanks to a booming Latin America mobile-phone business and higher sales at its Spanish fixed-line division.

 The biggest phone company in the Spanish-speaking world reported a net profit of 912 million euros ($1.17 billion) on Monday.

 Revenues leaped by 17 per cent to 8.28 billion euros, thanks largely to the acquisition of 10 mobile phone companies in Latin America from BellSouth. 

 Operating income before depreciation and amortisation (OIBDA) also topped expectations, helped by a job-cutting programme at its domestic fixed-line division, Telefonica de Espana. OIBDA rose 16 per cent to 3.41 billion euros.

 Unlike European peers such as France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, which reported a flat or falling sales in their fixed-line domestic businesses, Telefonica de Espana continued to grow in the first quarter.

 Its sales rose by 6 per cent thanks largely to flourishing broadband ADSL Internet subscriptions, despite mounting competition from France Telecom unit Uni2 and unlisted cable companies Auna and Ono.

 Telefonica, Europes third-largest telecoms group by market valuation behind Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom, said its client base reached 131 million subscribers in the first quarter. In the lucrative ADSL broadband Internet market, Telefonica reached 3.5 million clients, 1.5 million of whom are in Latin America.

 Telefonica has forecast a 12 to 15 per cent growth in revenue in 2005, 10 to 13 per cent growth for OIBDA and 12 to 18 per cent for the operating profit.

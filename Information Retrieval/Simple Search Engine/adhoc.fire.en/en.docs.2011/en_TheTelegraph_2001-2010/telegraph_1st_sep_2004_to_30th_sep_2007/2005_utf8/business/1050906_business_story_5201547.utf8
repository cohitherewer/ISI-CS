The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Apeejay Surrendra in full sail with ship buy 

 SAMBIT SAHA

 High tide

 Calcutta, Sept. 5: The Apeejay Surrendra group has clinched a multi-million-dollar deal to acquire two large ships, making it the largest privately-owned domestic shipping company.

 The Calcutta-based group, which is into hotel (The Park), retail (Oxford Bookstore, Flurys), tea and financial services businesses, paid $50 million for a Panamax and a Handymax ship.

 The company will now have a total capacity of 360,000 tonnes of dry bulk cargo.

 The ships, bought from a Singapore-based company, will be delivered by October and Apeejay Overseas Ltd, the shipping arm of the group, will start trading in them by the month-end.

 The company is also looking at more acquisitions. We are looking at a capacity of 5-6 lakh tonnes going forward, S.S. Mahapatra, chief executive of officer of the company, told The Telegraph.

 It is now talking to various banks and financial institutions to raise debt to fund the deal.

 The company is in dialogue with ICICI, ABN Amro and few other foreign banks to raise about $40 million for the same. We will fund the acquisition at 5:1 debt equity ratio, he added.

 The block deal with the Singapore company has ensured a reasonable price for the ships, he said.

 The Panamax vessel ? a 15-year old with a capacity of 70,000 tonnes ? was bought at $21 million. 

 The Handymax vessel ? a three-year old with a 52,000-tonne capacity ? came at $29 million.

 In our opinion, the market has bottomed out and we fished in at the right time. We have been on the lookout for an acquisition for quite sometime and it has finally happened, the CEO said.

 The company has posted a turnover of Rs 186 crore in 2004-05. It hopes to maintain the topline at the same level even as the global freight rate has come down from the highs of 2004.

 Following the acquisition, the total capacity of the company has gone up by 50 per cent.

 While it is adding new vessels, it is also trying to sell off two of its old ships, Mahapatra said.

 In April, for instance, the company sold a Panamax vessel with a capacity of 76,000 tonnes at a fairly good price.

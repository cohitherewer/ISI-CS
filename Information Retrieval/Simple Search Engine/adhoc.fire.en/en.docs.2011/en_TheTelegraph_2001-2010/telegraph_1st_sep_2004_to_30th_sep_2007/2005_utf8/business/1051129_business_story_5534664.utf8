 Brand India shines at meet

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 28: Captains of the Indian industry are gung-ho over Brand India. Manufacturers today said they would focus on increasing domestic demands.

 Companies first need to focus on the internal market by investing more in their country. We must ensure increase in domestic demands, besides trying to be global, Baba N. Kalyani, chairman and managing director of Bharat Forge, told an interactive session on Reinventing Manufacturing at the India Economic Summit. Industrialists also pointed out the various hurdles. High indirect taxes, inadequate infrastructure, supply-chain bottlenecks, shortage of power supply, high cost of capital, absence of information technology and lack of engineering talents are hampering growth.

 If India overcomes the challenge of logistics and supply chain and brings down indirect taxes to 15-20 per cent from the existing 30-35 per cent, it will be a great advantage, said Rangnath Salgame, president (India and Saarc), Cisco Systems.

 Participants from the manufacturing industry also said it is important for Indian companies to increase their volume of exports and become global manufacturers.

 Jubilant Organosys MD Hari S. Bhartia said, One of our competitive advantage is the ability to spend money on technology to satisfy the customers. Sustainability in chemical industry is important. There is a concern about design and innovation as India has not been able to match the Italian standards.

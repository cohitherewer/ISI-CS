 Menu of options for oil PSU recast

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Aiyar: Fuel for thought

 New Delhi, Jan. 24: V. Krishnamurthy, the chairman of the committee on ?synergy in energy?, today said some ?structural changes are required? in the public sector oil companies. ?They have been functioning reasonably efficiently but distortions have crept in?, which have to be addressed, he added.

 The committee, which includes former ONGC chairman B. C. Bohra and former Bharat Petroleum chairman U. Sundarajan as members, has been given a two-month initial deadline but Krishnamurthy said it would probably require more time.

 Briefing journalists after the first meeting of the newly-formed committee here today, he said the petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar had informed the committee of nine options for restructuring that had been worked out over the last seven months. The committee will examine all these options in detail and make its recommendations to the government. 

 Aiyar said the options discussed with the committee included maintaining the existing structure and letting the oil companies function in their present form. The other options are to have either one giant corporation or two mega players in the oil sector. Yet another option is to have two mega players in the oil sector and let Gail (India) continue in the gas sector. 

 The minister said the organisations of oil companies in China, Japan, Brazil, Russia and some western countries had been studied before chalking out the nine options. Now the committee would study these options in greater detail.

 The minister said China has two big groups concentrating on core competence and around 80 subsidiary companies to which the non-core work has been outsourced.

 He said the government was not racing against time to restructure the companies and the committee would be given more time if required, after which the government would deliberate on its recommendations.

 Krishnamurthy also clarified that restructuring would involve grouping or regrouping various companies. He said the committee would find ways to strengthen the public sector oil firms so that they could take on both domestic and international competition. 

 Aiyar, who returned from the NELP V roadshow in London, said he had received a good response from foreign companies to the oil and gas exploration blocks that are being offered through the global bidding route. 

 Aiyar said India was now recognised as the ?new kid on the block? in the international oil sector after ONGC Videsh has made its global foray and new finds by Niko-Resources and Reliance in the Krishna Godavari basin and Cairn Energy in Rajasthan.

 The minister said several medium-sized companies, which have not been to India, had shown interest in the roadshow and were keen to have a look at the geological data. ?However, it remains to be seen how many of them actually bid for the blocks,? he said.

 Aiyar said many companies in Europe were also appeared to be interested in the NELP-V round and he would hold a special roadshow in Amsterdam to reach out to them.

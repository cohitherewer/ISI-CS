 WestBridge fund garners $200 m 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 30: WestBridge Capital Partners garnered commitments worth $200 million from investors for its second venture capital fund, WestBridge Ventures II, LLC. 

 The Mauritius-based Indian venture capital firm today announced the closure of its second fund for subscription.

 The fund was highly oversubscribed with a strong interest both from the existing investors in WestBridge Fund I and new investors from leading US endowments and foundations, said Sumir Chadha, co-founder and senior managing director of WestBridge Capital while launching the fund.

 WestBridge, the largest and most active venture capital fund in India, will continue to focus on high growth companies across sectors ? business process outsourcing services, information technology and healthcare. Currently, the company manages a total fund of approximately $350 million. 

 With so many big time private equity funds entering India, the question in every bodys mind is whether there is enough investments to sustain their interest. We are seeing a significant number of high quality investment opportunities in India in sectors like services, outsourcing and technology, and we expect to maintain our investment pace at the rate of four to five new investments every year, clarified K.P. Balaraj, co-founder and managing director of WestBridge Capital.

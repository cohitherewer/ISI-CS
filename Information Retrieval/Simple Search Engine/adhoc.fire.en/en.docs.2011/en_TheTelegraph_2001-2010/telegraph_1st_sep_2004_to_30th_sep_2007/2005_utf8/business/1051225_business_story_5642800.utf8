 Hassen to hand over Skoda key to Folc

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bidding adieu

 New Delhi, Dec. 24: SkodaAuto India, the Indian subsidiary of German carmaker Volkswagen, will soon see Imran Hassen, the operations head in India, returning to Europe after a five-year stint here.

 Lukas Folc, chief finance officer of Skoda Auto India, will step into Hassen?s shoes and become the managing director. The change will come into effect from January 1.

 Folc has worked with the company both in India and Mlada Boleslav. 

 Company officials say Hassen, who was entrusted with the responsibility of setting up SkodaAuto India, had come here on a five-year contract.

 The Indian subsidiary entered the automobile market in 2000, while its Aurangabad facility started production in 2001.

 Last month, Hassen commissioned expansion of the assembly line at the Aurangabad plant.

 The assembly line has doubled its production capacity to 30,000 units. This greenfield manufacturing facility is the first plant of SkodaAuto outside Europe.

 In his five-year tenure, Hassen helped the company corner a 25 per cent market share by selling 25,000 cars. He also launched a slew of models, apart from introducing new technology and different platforms of production.

 In India, the company has a portfolio of 12 models, including luxury cars like Superb, L amp;K, RS, Rider, Elegance, Automatic, Ambiente and the new Laura.

 Earlier this month, SkodaAuto announced a hike in prices of all models up to Rs 30,000 by January next year.

 ?The prices of all the 12 models from SkodaAuto India will go up by Rs 15,000 to Rs 30,000. This is being done due to increased freight costs,? Hassen had said.

 The luxury carmaker is steady on its plans to launch two versions of its Octavia range next year ? one in the January and the other in March.

 SkodaAuto sold 909 cars in November, up 65.5 per cent compared with 549 units in the same period last year.

 However, the hike in prices would not be applicable to the Laura, which comes with a tag of Rs 16,81,081 (ex-showroom Delhi). 

 Hassen had said despite the planned price hike, the companys products would remain competitive in their respective categories.

 The company plans to launch two versions of its Octavia range in January and March.

 ?We would continue to bring in new technologies and keep introducing new products,? he had said.

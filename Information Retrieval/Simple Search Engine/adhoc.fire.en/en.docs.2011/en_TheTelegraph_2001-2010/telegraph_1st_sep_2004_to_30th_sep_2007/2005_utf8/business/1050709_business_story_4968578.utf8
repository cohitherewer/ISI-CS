 Patni puts ADS issue on fast track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 8: Patni Computer Systems Ltd is planning a sponsored American depository shares (ADS) issue.

 The company informed the stock exchanges today that its board would meet on July 11 to consider the proposal. Earlier, shareholders had allowed the company to issue ADRs up to $150 million, including a green-shoe option.

 With this, Patni joins the ranks of Infosys Technologies, Satyam Computers and ICICI Bank, which have issued ADS in recent months. Such issues have been made primarily to improve liquidity in overseas markets and reduce the premium between ADRs and domestic shares.

 Domestic shareholders also gain from such issues as they earn a higher premium to the local market price after tendering the shares. 

 Infosys promoters and directors had earned more than Rs 1,500 crore by divesting over 5 million shares at the ADS offering in May. 

 Satyam promoters, however, did not participate in the offer, while institutional investors reaped the maximum benefit. In this case, 30 million local shares were converted to 15 million ADS.

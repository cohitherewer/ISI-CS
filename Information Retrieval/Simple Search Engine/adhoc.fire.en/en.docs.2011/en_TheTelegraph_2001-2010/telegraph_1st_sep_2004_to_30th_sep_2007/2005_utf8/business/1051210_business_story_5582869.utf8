 Inflation at 4.54%

 New Delhi, Dec. 9 (PTI): Inflation inched up to 4.54 per cent for the week ended November 26 from 4.32 per cent in the previous week. 

 The rise in the rate of inflation was primarily due to increase in the prices of essential food items such as fruits and vegetables, tea, eggs, edible oils and some manufactured products like textiles, cranes and tractors. 

 Yet, the index for increase in the general price level was much lower than 7.3 per cent a year ago.

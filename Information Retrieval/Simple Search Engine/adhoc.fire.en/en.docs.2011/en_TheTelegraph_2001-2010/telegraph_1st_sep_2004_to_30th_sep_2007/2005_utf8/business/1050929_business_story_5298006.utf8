 Tata Tele taps TCS

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 28: Tata Teleservices will outsource its IT infrastructure management to Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) for Rs 1,000 crore ($250 million) for five years. 

 TCS will manage IT infrastructure of Tata Teleservices (TTSL) and Tata Teleservices, Maharashtra. 

 Tata Teleservices operates in 20 circles and has a customer base of over 5.2 million. It has been ramping up capacity and spread in recent times.

 In a similar move, Bharti Teleservices has recently outsourced its IT infrastructure management to IBM.

 While the listed Tata Teleservices, Maharashtra, operates in two circles of Maharashtra and Goa, and Mumbai, the main company is not listed on the bourses. 

 The shares of Tata Teleservices, Maharashtra, rose 6.64 per cent to Rs 32.10 from its previous close of Rs 30.10. Rumours suggest that South Korea Telecom is keen to pick up a stake in Tata Teleservices.

 The partnership with TCS will provide a comprehensive IT roadmap for Tata Teleservices with a state-of-the-art infrastructure to support existing and new business initiatives, while delivering high-quality service, a joint statement said. 

 The key technology differentiator will be a robust, technologically scaled infrastructure and systems capable of servicing the needs of millions of TTSL customers, it said. 

 TCS will manage all IT related activities, including implementation, application development and maintenance as well as change management across the enterprise. 

 In addition, management of data centres, information security management, training end-users on new applications, disaster recovery and business continuity will also be the responsibility of TCS as a part of the strategic engagement. 

 TCS is committed to delivering world-class solutions for Tata Teleservices, said S. Ramadorai, CEO amp; managing director of TCS.

 Reliance calls for fine rethink

 Clarity signal 

 New Delhi, Jan. 14: Reliance Infocomm has urged the government to reconsider the Rs 150-crore penalty imposed by the department of telecommunications, arguing it has not violated any of the licence conditions. 

 The telecom major termed the imposition of the fine ?totally misconceived?. 

 In a 10-page letter to the department, Reliance Infocomm has pointed out that since interconnection agreements between service providers need to be decided either by adjudication or arbitration, there is no justification in levying a penalty.

 It has also highlighted that the home-country direct (HCD) service does not fall foul of the licence norms. 

 The company argued that that caller-line identification (CLI) is an interactive voice response system-based service. ?We have repeated several times that there is a difference in tempering the CLI and presentation of switch CLI. We only do the latter,? the letter said.

 The company contended that unified access licence allowed all types of services to be offered, other than those requiring separate authorisation. ?The home-country direct service does not need a separate licence,? it said.

 Refuting allegations by Bharat Sanchar Nigam and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam, Reliance contended the access deficit charge (ADC) has been paid to the two firms. 

 The company pointed out that an international long distance (ILD) service provider has to pay ADC to the fixed-line operator in whose network the international call is terminated. Hence, a penalty of Rs 550 crore, based on the allegation that international calls were routed as local ones, is a false claim by the two public sector companies, Reliance Infocomm said.

 ?The issue we have raised is about the interpretation on who is the terminating operator. If the company in whose network the international call ends is the terminating operator, the ADC is paid to the HCD service provider (RIL in this case). No statutory payment of ADC has been avoided,? the Reliance Info letter states.

 Since the department of telecommunications is yet to reply to its ?repeated? requests for pointing out violations, the company said the penalty is unwarranted.

 Loan lifeline to shore up Braithwaite 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 29: The cabinet committee on economic affairs today cleared a financial package to turn around ailing Braithwaite amp; Co.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram told reporters that the government will waive interest worth Rs 43.61 crore on a loan that it had given to the Calcutta-based company and convert the credit amount of Rs 69.30 crore into equity.

 A grant of Rs 4 crore has been sanctioned to serve as margin money to help the company raise working capital from the market.

 No interest will be levied beyond the cut-off date of March 31, 2005, he added. 

 The company has also been allowed to reduce its equity capital to the extent of Rs 167.30 crore by adjusting accumulated losses, Chidambaram said.

 The financial package, based on the recommendations of the Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises and committee of secretaries, will clean the balancesheet of Braithwaite and make its net worth positive. 

 This will improve the creditworthiness of the company and enable it to borrow funds from banks and financial institutions to finance its diversification plans and ward off the threat to its survival, he said.

 Chidambaram said the wagon maker produces 400 units, which will be raised to 1,000 units in four years.

 The company has 564 employees on its rolls and pays a wage bill of Rs 6 crore per year. The heavy industries ministry has already approached its railway counterpart to get more orders for Braithwaite.

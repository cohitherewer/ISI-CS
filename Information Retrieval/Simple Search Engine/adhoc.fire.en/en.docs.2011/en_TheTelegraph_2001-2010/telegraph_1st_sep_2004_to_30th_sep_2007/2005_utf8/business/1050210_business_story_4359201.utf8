 Red signal for fake auto parts

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: The next time your car sputters to a dead stop and you wring your hands in despair, don?t blame the carmaker or your stars. The chances are that your vehicle is running on fake auto components.

 Here?s your wake up call: 37 per cent of all auto components out there are fake.

 The menace of fake spares has assumed serious dimensions in the Rs 3900-crore replacement market for auto components and the spare parts brigade has now decided to hit back.

 The Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (Acma) has formed a consumer affairs and spurious parts committee, which is working specifically to counter the menace of counterfeit products.

 ?The penalties against counterfeiting need to be severe in India and a more pro-active law against counterfeiters is required,? said Madhur Bajaj, vice-president of Bajaj Auto Ltd.

 Bajaj, who is the vice-president of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers? Association (SIAM), inaugurated the country?s premier exposition on automotive spares and services sector here today.

 The level of counterfeit products in the auto components market has been assessed on the basis of research conducted by Acma for 12 major components.

 Since consumers rely heavily on roadside auto garages and mechanics, there is a tendency to go for cheap and, therefore, fake products. What is needed is an effective after-sales network of vehicle manufacturers and also an efficient distribution network of equipment distributors and retailers.

 Acma has now started an asli naqli campaign that will not only try to ensure that genuine components thrive in the market, but that the consumers can distinguish between the asli (genuine) and the naqli (fake). Acma says vehicle manufacturers have failed to educate consumers with manuals and publications. 

 Through consumer campaigns in sales points and elsewhere, Acma will try and ensure that consumers are able to easily identify markers like holograms, aspects of printing and packaging and pouches and seals, the association spokesperson said.

 In one of its report, Acma also blames vehicle makers for the menace of spurious products.

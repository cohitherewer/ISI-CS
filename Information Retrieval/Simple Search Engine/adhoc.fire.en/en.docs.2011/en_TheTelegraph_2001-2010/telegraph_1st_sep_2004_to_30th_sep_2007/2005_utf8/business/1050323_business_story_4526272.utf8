 Finance firms seek level-playing field

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 22: Non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) have sought a level-playing field with banks and housing finance companies and access to refinance from institutions like Sidbi and Nabard.

 While presenting their case to RBI governor Y. V. Reddy last week, NBFCs also asked for a cover under the debt recovery tribunal and the Sarfaesi Act in order to protect their assets. 

 The objective of the meeting was to work out a three-year perspective for the sector. 

 According to RBI officials, the Finance Industry Development Council, a representative body of NBFCs, had urged the central bank to view their sector as complementary to banking and not competitive. 

 They pointed out that according to regulations, NBFCs are on a par with banks, financial institutions and housing finance companies.

 NBFCs also said easy access to bank finance and refinance would help reduce their dependence on public deposits. 

 While rationalising the number of regulations, deposit insurance and rating of NBFCs were also discussed in the meeting.

 NBFCs? strengths lie in local knowledge, credit appraisal skills, well-trained collection machinery and close monitoring of borrowers, the council said.

 Reddy pointed out that NBFCs were an important part of the services sector and stressed the need to strengthen these institutions, which are crucial to enhance credit delivery.

 The RBI has to protect the interest of depositors and it would ensure that public deposit taking companies and systemically important non-deposit taking entities are well regulated, Reddy said.

 The central bank is preparing a roadmap through a consultative process to strengthen NBFCs and grow their asset base, he added.

 The Reserve Bank has also given an option to NBFCs to voluntarily move out of the public deposit taking activity if they found that the regulatory costs outweighed their benefits.

 In case an NBFC chose to get out of public deposits, the central bank would help the entity with training and technology support, Reddy said.

 According to NBFCs, the central bank?s 1998 regulations had helped weed out non-serious players from the market and infused greater discipline in the sector.

 In its pre-budget memorandum to the finance ministry, the council had urged for a level-playing ground for non-banking finance companies with banks and infrastructure capital companies. 

 The representation had said NBFCs? income is subject to income tax before deductions on provisions made for bad assets. However, for banks, provisions for non-performing assets are deducted before calculating taxable income. 

 Sanjay Chamria, managing committee member of FIDC, had said such provisions are made in an NBFC?s books to represent the healthy financial status of these financial companies. 

 Hence, the council had sought an amendment to the relevant portions of section 36(1)(viia) and 43D.

 Secondly, NBFCs are not entitled to certain benefits available to infrastructure capital companies and funds by way of tax exemptions.

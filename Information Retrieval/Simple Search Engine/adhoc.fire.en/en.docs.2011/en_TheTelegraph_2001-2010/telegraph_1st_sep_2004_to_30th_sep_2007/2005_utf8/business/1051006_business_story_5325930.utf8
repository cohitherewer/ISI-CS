 New-issue scramble at ICICI Bank

 Mumbai, Oct. 5: The board of ICICI Bank will meet on October 13 to consider another public offering of shares.

 The move will help it drum up resources needed for a spurt in lending that most banks have witnessed over the past couple of months. 

 A large number of them, particularly, the nationalised ones, have come out with their second round of public offers. Dena Bank, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda and Bank of India are among those that are planning fresh flotations.

 The loan rush driving banks to stock exchanges again has been fuelled by a huge demand for funds from individuals and companies. Banks also need capital to comply with the Basel II norms, kicking in from March 2007.

 In a letter to exchanges today, ICICI Bank said its board would meet on October 13 to consider half-year results and further issue of equity capital by the bank. Officials refused to divulge details of the two items on the agenda. 

 The countrys second-largest bank last came out with an offer in April last year, when its Rs 3,050-crore issue was sold in a price band of Rs 255-295 per share. 

 The funds were raised to tap opportunities arising from industrial revival and to expand internationally. Some of the money raised was also used to support a subsidiary.

 The highlight of the issue was the greenshoe option of Rs 450 crore. This was used to stabilise the share if it fell below the issue price at the time of listing or later. The bank had then appointed DSP Merrill Lynch as the stabilising agent. 

 Ahead of this issue, the bank had sold 16.5 per cent to foreign institutional investors for Rs 1,318 crore.

 In February, ICICI Bank priced its sponsored American depository share at $21.11 apiece. Around 38.3 million shares were converted into 19.2 million ADS in a $405-million deal. Each ADS represented two underlying shares. Five per cent of the banks equity was sold in the issue.

 The announcement of a fresh issue confused the markets, where the banks share closed lower at Rs 561.35 after opening at Rs 590.90 and rising to a high of Rs 597.40. Bank shares have been a top pick on the shopping list of investors. 

 Considering the recent success of bank initial public offerings, analysts expect a good response to the new equity issue from ICICI Bank. Though estimates vary, most expect a mop-up of Rs 1000 crore.

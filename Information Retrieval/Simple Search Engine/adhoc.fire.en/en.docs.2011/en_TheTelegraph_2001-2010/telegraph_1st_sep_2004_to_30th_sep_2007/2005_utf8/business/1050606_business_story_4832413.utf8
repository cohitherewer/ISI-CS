 Kingpins bypass demat drive

 SATISH JOHN 

 Bhave: Tech talk

 Mumbai, June 5: The promoters of many public sector companies and MNCs cling to physical share certificates even now, ignoring the regulatory drive to go paperless.

 For some of them, that proportion is more than 50 per cent. The lack of interest in keeping pace with a technology that promises to make holding shares simpler and foolproof comes at a time when firms like Infosys have dematerialised 99 per cent of all their shares. 

 The promoter (government) of Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd and State Bank of India retains its holding in the physical form. Demat is not a religion. Everybody need not convert, C. B. Bhave, managing director of National Securities Depository, said. His firm stores paperless shares for a fee.

 Dematerialisation makes settlement of deals on exchanges smooth, unlike the old times when huge volumes of paper certificates changed hands in a process that was frightfully cumbersome and fraught with risks.

 It is not oil PSUs alone where the government holds shares in the form of paper certificates. In State Bank of India, the Reserve Bank owns over 59 per cent of the banks equity ? or 31.43 crore shares ? in the old format. It is possible that these shares are held in one certificate.

 Bhave concedes that shares need to be de-materialised only if they are to be traded. The centre, which does not sell or buy too many of these shares, holds them in the name of the President of India. The government owns 74.14 per cent of ONGC, 51.01 per cent of HPCL and more than 66 per cent of BPCL in physical form. 

 The MNCs, normally at the vanguard of technology changes, have also been slow to embrace electronic assets. Unilever, the worlds leading fast moving consumer goods major, still holds its 51 per cent stake in Hindustan Lever in physical form. However, Hind Lever officials insist that 80 percent of the remaining 49 per cent in the hands of smaller shareholders is dematerialised.

 Bhave says minority shareholders stand to gain more by de-materialising shares. It makes it easier for them to nominate a successor or change it. Even the mundane drill of recording a new address is simpler in demat shares.

 For the government, such benefits are of little consequence. For, it does not nominate anyone; nor does it trade in its shares. Unlike private promoters, it cannot even pledge the shares to secure loans. However, a large section of the brokers feels the Centre could switch to the paperless form to set an example for others.

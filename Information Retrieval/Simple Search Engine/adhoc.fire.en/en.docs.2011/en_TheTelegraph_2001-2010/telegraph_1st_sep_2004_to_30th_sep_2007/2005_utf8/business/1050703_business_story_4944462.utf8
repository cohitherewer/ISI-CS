 Phone vendors put on alert

 Calcutta, July 2: The Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association (Tema) is planning to put in place a quality standard for domestic manufacturers to help them compete with multinationals.

 Tema president N. K. Goyal said: It is important for domestic players to maintain strict quality standards in order to be able to compete with multinationals, who now control most of the wireless equipment market. With wireline segment seeing limited growth, domestic manufacturers will have to assure the operators of quality and price that is competitive with major suppliers.

 The telecom infrastructure market has grown by 71 per cent in the last fiscal to cross the Rs 14,000 crore mark compared with a 34 per cent decline in 2003-04. Wireless infrastructure equipment contributes to 80 per cent of this market.

 Currently, domestic manufacturers are fragmented and many fall under the small and medium enterprises (SME) segment. Moreover, when the government opened up the telecom sector, the manufacturers did not upgrade themselves to meet the challenge from European and US-based vendors.

 Goyal feels that a common grading system will bring the industry together and also allow for a unified approach.

 The growth last year (2004-05) was mainly due to the huge investments made in network expansion by all access providers, especially for the GSM services, said Goyal. 

 Broadband rollout is also expected to contribute greatly to the telecom sectors growth in the next two years.

 A report by Pyramid Research indicates that expenditure on network infrastructure is likely to come down to 33 per cent of the total capital expenditure of the operators by 2009 from 47 per cent at present. The slow down is expected to begin by the end of this year.

 Goyal, however, believes that the industry will double its size to cross the Rs 30,000 crore mark this year only. The growth for 2006-07 will though slow down marginally to just over Rs 40,000 crore.

 The domestic equipment manufacturers are losing the operators trust is evident from the fact that the state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) is setting up a joint venture with Chinese manufacturers, not only for handsets but also for manufacturing broadband equipment like ADSL modems, splitters and even SIM cards.

 The telecom cables industry is also showing signs of revival with 119 per cent growth in 2004-05.

 Another major hassle faced by the domestic industry is the tax structure. Till the last budget, the industry was plagued by the inverted duty structure that made imports cheaper. While the structure was revised in the 2005-06 budget, the addition of 12.5 per cent value-added tax (VAT) has added to the costs, the industry players said.

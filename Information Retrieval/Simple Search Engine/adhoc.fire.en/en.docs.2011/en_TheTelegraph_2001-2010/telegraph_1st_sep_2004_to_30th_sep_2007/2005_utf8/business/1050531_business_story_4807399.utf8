 Ispat eyes south for sponge iron sales

 A STAFF REPORTER

 New beginning

 Calcutta, May 30: Ispat Industries will enter the sponge-iron market from June by taking advantage of falling scrap prices.

 The company will mainly cater to the southern market where demand for sponge iron is soaring because of a large number of auto component units.

 Out of a capacity of 1.6 million tonnes of directly reduced iron (DRI) or sponge iron, the company is producing only 1.1 million tonnes at present.

 The integrated steel producer has the technology to switch to varying proportions of raw materials.

 It generally uses 60 per cent hot metal from the blast furnace, 30-35 per cent DRI and about 5 per cent metal scrap.

 The company intends to ramp up the use of scrap and lower that of DRI to cash in on the recent reduction in scrap prices.

 US scrap prices have gone down by 30 per cent in the last few months. The free-on-board (f.o.b) prices of US scrap is about $180 a tonne, while the landed price will be $220 a tonne.

 The exercise will not only help the company diversify its product mix but also help bring down its cost of production.

 The price differential with DRI is now Rs 2,500 a tonne. By selling it in the market with a reasonable margin, the company stands to gain Rs 4,000 more a tonne.

 ?It is a good strategy by the company at a time when raw material prices are erratic. The use of scrap is judicial as its prices are expected to remain stable to down in the next one year,? industry observers said.

 The company will remain committed to the sponge iron business even if the price advantage goes away.

 ?If required, we will raise the production in the DRI plant to meet customer demand. We will sell sponge iron even after expansion,? an Ispat official said.

 Ispat has a finished steel making capacity of 2.4 million tonnes for which its metallics is fed predominantly through a mix of scrap, DRI and hot metal/ pig iron from its 2-million-tonne blast furnace. 

 Ispat?s DRI plant is one of the world?s largest mega module plants. Ispat will expand its steel making capacity to over 3 million tonnes in the next few months at Ispat?s Dolvi complex near Mumbai.

 India?s sponge iron making capacity is about 10 MT while consumers use 9 MT. Essar and Ispat are the two big players. The smaller, coal based units are generally located in the east. In contrast, the Ispat plant is gas-based, producing higher iron content sponge iron.

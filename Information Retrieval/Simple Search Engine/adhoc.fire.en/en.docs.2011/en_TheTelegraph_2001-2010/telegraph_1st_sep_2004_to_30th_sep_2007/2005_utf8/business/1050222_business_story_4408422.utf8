 Kerala memorandum to protect plantations

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: The Kerala government has sought the intervention of commerce minister Kamal Nath for the protection of the traditional plantation sector that includes pepper, tea, cardamom and rubber. 

 Kerala chief minister Oomen Chandy has presented a memorandum to the minister asking him to provide for such protection in the country?s foreign trade policy.

 The chief minister has also asked to continue the export subsidies to rubber without putting a cap on the quantity. The state also wants vanilla to be included in the list of sensitive agricultural products for foreign trade.

 The commerce minister is reported to have assured him that the government is considering further steps to clamp down on pepper imports as prices of the domestic crop have crashed. This has caused immense hardship to Indian growers.

 Cheap pepper and tea imports have hit the domestic plantation sector and there is serious concern on the issue.

 Nath is reported to have informed Chandy that the government had already stopped the import of pepper through the advance licensing scheme and would consider further measures to tighten imports of the commodity. The minister has agreed on the need to ensure stable prices in the pepper market. 

 Imports of tea and coffee have more than doubled during the first eight months of the current fiscal to Rs 98.86 crore from Rs 43.5 crore in the same period of the previous year. Imports of inferior tea from countries such as Vietnam is also a major area of concern as it is being re-exported as Indian tea. This is damaging the image of the Indian brand. 

 Cheap pepper imports are flooding the country because of the free trade agreement with Sri Lanka.

 Chandy had informed the commerce minister that large-scale imports from Sri Lanka had caused pepper price in the state to dip as low as Rs 55 per kg.

 He said the Kerala government had started market intervention efforts by procuring pepper at Rs 75 per kg. The chief minister sought the central government?s assistance in carrying out these market intervention operations.

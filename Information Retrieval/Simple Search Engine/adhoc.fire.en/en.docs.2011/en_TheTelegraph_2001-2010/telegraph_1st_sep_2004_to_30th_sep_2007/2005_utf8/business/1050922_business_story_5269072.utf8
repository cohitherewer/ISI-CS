 India, China to lead Asian growth

 Washington, Sept. 22 (AFP): India and China will expand by about 7 per cent this year and the next, leading the way as a regional growth engine, the International Monetary Fund said today.

 Economic activity in India is expected to be moderate, with growth seen at 7.1 per cent this year and 6.3 per cent in 2006.

 The IMF predicted economic growth in Asia outside Japan would hit 7.3 per cent this year and 6.9 per cent next year, while China would expand by 9 per cent and 8.2 per cent, respectively.

 In its twice-annual world economic outlook, the IMF said, Much depends on the strength of the pickup in the IT sector as well as developments in the United States and, increasingly, China.

 Asian economies have been showing divergent growth patterns, with the regions two giants, China and India, faring better than the rest. While growth in China and India have remained relatively robust, expansion in much of the rest of the region slowed, the IMF said.

 The IMF has urged India to speed up infrastructure spending, especially in the energy sector, where steep growth in demand is forecast for years ahead. It has also called for broader reform measures. It is now critical to build a political consensus to significantly accelerate the pace of structural reforms.

 (This will) ensure that India achieve a growth of 7-8 per cent, absorb its growing labour force, and realise the demographic dividend.

 The IMFs forecast marks a modest upturn, but potential pitfalls remained ahead, the organisation said. Risks are increasingly slanted to the downside. Persistently high oil prices will adversely affect activity, the IMF warned.

 Some 75 to 100 million Indians will enter the labour market in the coming decade, fuelling an increase in savings and investment given the higher propensity for workers to save, the IMF said.

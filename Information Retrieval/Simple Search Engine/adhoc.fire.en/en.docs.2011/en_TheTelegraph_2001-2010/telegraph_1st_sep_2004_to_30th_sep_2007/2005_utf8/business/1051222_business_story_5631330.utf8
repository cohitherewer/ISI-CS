 Ranbaxy shrugs off patent setback

 VIVEK NAIR

 The right dose

 Mumbai, Dec. 21: Ranbaxy Laboratories may be down after losing an important patent challenge case to Pfizer Inc, but it is certainly not out. It has lined up a series of drug launches in 2006 in the US, the world?s largest pharmaceutical market.

 Ranbaxy plans to launch 15 products over the next two years in the US, of which at least 2-3 drugs will boost the firm?s bottomline next year, observers said.

 The performance of Ranbaxy this year has been disappointing with severe pricing pressures in generics and no significant product launches. In the recent quarter, its sales in the US had taken a hit of 25 per cent.

 However, analysts feel Ranbaxy will post better earnings in 2006 on the back of the launch of the anti-cholesterol drugs, Pravastatin and Simvastatin, and Modafinil, which is used to treat excessive sleepiness.

 Ranbaxy is likely to fare well with Pravastatin as it will obtain a 180-day exclusive rights to market the 80 mg pill. This is because of its first-to-file status for marketing the generic version of Bristol-Myers Squibb?s Pravachol. A report by Refco sees Pravastatin contributing close to $28 million to Ranbaxy?s topline after considering 50 per cent price erosion and 60 per cent market share.

 ?This will help the company manage the pricing pressure to some extent,? the report adds. Ranbaxy expects to launch the drug in April.

 Ranbaxy also plans to launch Simvastatin (80 mg) in June on an exclusive basis. Merck has withdrawn patents for this drug, originally named Zocor. Consequently, Ranbaxy had brought a suit against the FDA on September 11 to resolve the question of exclusivity. A hearing for the case is expected in January.

 Ranbaxy is also optimistic of obtaining shared exclusivity for Modafinil and the launch is expected in June next year.

 ?For 2006, Ranbaxy?s numbers will be better because of these product launches. The company has projected a sales growth of 18 per cent and an operating margin of more than 16 per cent. These are achievable. We must also not forget that this will be against a lower base,? said Shahina Mukadam, head of research at IDBI Capital Services.

 According to a pharma analyst associated with a foreign brokerage, while the second half of 2006 is likely to be positive for Ranbaxy, operating margins could also jump as R amp;D expenses and litigation costs are set to come down.

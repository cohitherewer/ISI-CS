 Coal Videsh, but not quite

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Oct. 26: Coal India Limited (CIL), which is yet to get the Centres nod to float its subsidiary ? Coal Videsh, has set up a department for overseas acquisition. The department, which is being called Coal Videsh, is scouting for coal blocks in South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe to meet the countrys coking coal requirements.

 Senior CIL officials said a four-member team, led by Coal Videsh chief general manager N. Prasad and comprising senior geologist P.K. Goswami, senior finance manager Subir Chakroborty and mining expert Sagar Sen, has left for these countries to hold talks with the respective governments.

 The team, which will return in the second week of November, will examine the blocks and their reserves, officials said. They will also scrutinise the offers from the governments and negotiate with them. Coal Videsh is keen to form joint ventures with these countries for coal blocks, they added.

 CIL is closely monitoring its pilot project in coking coal mining in Mozambique before going full throttle on its joint venture.

 We are awaiting the production and financial feasibility report of the Mozambique pilot project. Coal Videshs future overseas ventures depend on this UNDP-assisted project, CIL sources said.

 Coal Videsh is also observing the Mozambique governments move on revitalising Carbomoc, a coal company that had stopped full-scale production after years of civil war ruined the rail infrastructure, sources added.

 Coal Videsh has to contribute 10 million tonnes of coal by 2010 and 50 million tonnes by 2020. The four-member team is also expected to visit Australia at a later date.

 While Australia will be the prime destination for coking coal imports, Coal Videsh will give equal priority to the two African nations ? Zimbabwe and Mozambique. 

 In the second stage of operations, Coal Videsh will venture into Russia, Kazakhstan, Canada, Venezuela and Poland for coking coal, the officials said, adding that it was imperative to accelerate import of coking coal to feed the rapidly-growing steel production in the country.

 CIL has targeted Indonesia and South Africa for import of thermal coal, the officials added. New power projects are coming up in the country and we need good quality thermal coal to meet the growing demand, they added.

 Regarding the incorporation of Coal Videsh, the CIL officials said the proposal is lying before the Centre. As soon as the government clears the proposal, Coal Videsh will be incorporated as a separate company, they added.

 Calcutta, June 17: With the Union cabinet giving its go-ahead to the proposal of IISCO merger with Steel Authority of India (SAIL), the individual units of the SAIL family, such as Durgapur Steel Plant (DSP), are exploring synergies with the new entrant. 

 DSP managing director S. K. Bhattacharya said the two plants (IISCO and DSP) could benefit a lot from the merger. The IISCO plant at Burnpur and DSP are not very far from one another. The total production of these two units then has to be looked in tandem, he said at a press meet in Calcutta on Friday.

 Bhattacharya, who is also on the board of IISCO, said both units have been making flat products and SAIL could look at introducing new flat products in any of them.

 There will be a transfer of technology and people between the two plants as it is a practice among SAIL units, he pointed out. Besides, Iisco needs a major restructuring to help it stand on its own.

 Hit with high coal prices, DSP has been considering different ways to curb the use of coke to cut steel making costs.

 IISCO has some collieries in its portfolio and DSP, located close to it, could be a direct beneficiary of that. 

 Expansion plans

 SAIL has decided to pump in Rs 2,800 crore to expand DSPs capacity to 3 million tonnes and strengthen the finishing line unit of the plant to further improve its bottomline.

 The company plans to install bar and rod-making capacities and a medium structural mill, which together will cost around Rs 1,200 crores, Bhattacharya said.

 These mills are crucial for improving the plants bottomline because DSP produces almost 50 per cent semis at present, he added.

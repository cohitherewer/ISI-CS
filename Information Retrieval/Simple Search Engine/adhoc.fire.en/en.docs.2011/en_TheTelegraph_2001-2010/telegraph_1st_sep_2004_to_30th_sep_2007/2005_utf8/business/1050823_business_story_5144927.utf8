 Heinz posts lower earnings

 Chicago, Aug. 22 (Reuters): Ketchup and packaged food producer HJ Heinz Co on Monday said quarterly profit fell 19 per cent because of weak demand in parts of Europe and reorganisation costs.

 Heinz, based in Pittsburgh, said it was still on track to meet full-year profit targets despite steep commodity costs and a stronger US dollar that pressures international results. Analysts, on average, expect a full-year profit of $2.39 per share.

 Net income was $157.3 million, or 45 cents a share, in the fiscal first quarter ended July 27, compared with $194.8 million, or 55 cents per share, a year earlier.

 Excluding one-time items, Heinz earned 52 cents per share, 2 cents better than the average estimate among analysts.

 Net earnings included after-tax charges of $24.5 million for job cuts and other restructuring efforts. Heinz is considering selling some businesses to cut costs, but gave no details on those plans.

 The company expects to incur $100 million in restructuring costs for the full fiscal year.

 First-quarter sales rose to $2.1 billion from $2.0 billion a year earlier, driven by its North American consumer products segment. The company reported strong demand for its namesake Heinz brand as well as TGI Fridays and Ore-Ida frozen food.

 Sales were flat in Europe as declines in the companys seafood business and weakness in the British soup market offset strong ketchup sales. European operating profit dropped nearly 16 per cent, primarily because of weakness in Britain and Northern Europe.

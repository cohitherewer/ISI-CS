 FIIs take a shine to steel 

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, April 15: Foreign financial institutions (FIIs) have raised their stakes in frontline steel companies like Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) ahead of their annual results.

 The last financial year was possibly the best for the steel companies, which glided along a high-demand curve. 

 ?There was a sustained rise in price realisation throughout the year. The same may not be repeated again. We expect domestic steel rates to stabilise at current levels. So, last year?s performance could well be the best from steel companies on an annual basis,? an official from a leading brokerage said.

 The last quarter also saw FIIs buying into smaller companies like Mahindra Ugine Steel and Uttam Galva Steel. 

 SAIL, which zoomed past its full-year profit target by a sizeable margin in the first three quarters, has bagged the highest FII attention in the last quarter. FII stake stood at 4.23 per cent in the fourth quarter compared with 1.58 per cent a year ago.

 In Tata Steel, their holding rose from 13.88 per cent in December to 15.36 per cent in March.

 Unlike FIIs, local financial institutions (FIs) have pruned their stakes. In Tisco, they have slashed their holding from 23.70 per cent in the third quarter to 22.32 per cent in the fourth. In SAIL, their stake has fallen from 5.84 per cent to 4.87 per cent.

 ?During the last quarter, the market touched its peak and so did the steel stocks. Financial institutions bought when prices were low and partly booked profit. FIIs bought afresh,? a market observer said.

 In Mahindra Ugine, the FII stake rose to 3.88 per cent in the fourth quarter from 1.37 per cent in the third; in Uttam Galva, it jumped to 2.93 per cent from 0.2 per cent. By contrast, FIs cut their stake.

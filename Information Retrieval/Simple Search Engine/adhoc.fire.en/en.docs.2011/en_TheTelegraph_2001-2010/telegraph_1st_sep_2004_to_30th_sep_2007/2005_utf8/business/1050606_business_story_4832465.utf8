 Low-power wireless to be freed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Picture perfect

 New Delhi, June 5: The government will soon de-license the use of ?citizen band? low-power devices (one milli-watt) on selected frequencies to popularise the use of wireless fidelity (Wi-fi) based gizmos, amateur radio, aero-modelling, mountaineering and trekking. 

 According to Union communications ministry officials, the necessary notification for the use of the citizen band will be issued in the next few days.

 This will allow use of low-power equipment in the frequency band 26.957-27.283 mega hertz (MHz), also known as citizen band with 5 Watt effective radiated power and built-in antenna, on non-interference, non-protection and shared (non-exclusive) basis.

 The decision to de-licence the use of low-power devices was initiated by the BJP-led NDA government. But it hit a roadblock because the security agencies had sought certain clarifications and wanted some measures to avoid misuse of the facility.

 Recently, the communications minister, Dayanidhi Maran, had announced that the ministry would get the necessary clearance for the citizen band to be used by the people, particularly the students, in remote parts. 

 Persons who are using such citizen band equipment for hobbies like aero-modelling, mountaineering, trekking and for radio control of models can now operate without a licence.

 In addition, the government has also simplified the procedure to acquire licences for amateur radios and has extended the time limit for licences. The amateur licences are issued for a maximum period of five years. Now a radio amateur licence can be issued for a period of 20 years or for lifetime, which will reduce the need to approach the department repeatedly for renewal of the licence. 

 The government has already de-licensed the use of wireless equipment in the frequency band 2.4-2.4835 giga hertz (GHz) with effective radiated power up to 4 watts and indoor use of low-power equipment in the frequency bands 5.150-5.350 GHz and 5.725-5.875 GHz.

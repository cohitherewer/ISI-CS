 Price cuts bite into Unilever net

 Ground Reality

 London, Nov. 3 (Reuters): Consumer goods giant Unilever has reported an 11 per cent dip in the third-quarter profit as expected, but its shares fell because, despite a big rise in marketing, it failed to increase prices and its margins dropped.

 The Anglo-Dutch group, the maker of Hellmanns mayonnaise, Sunsilk shampoo and Dove soap, suffered in Europe where sales slipped 2 per cent as it cut prices to stay competitive and its ice-cream turnover declined markedly.

 Analysts said Unilever was the only major consumer goods group not to have achieved overall price increases in the third-quarter and, although marketing spending was rising, it had not seen any improvement in its global market shares.

 Finance director Rudy Markham said quarterly net profit and earnings from continuing operations were both down 11 per cent with net profit at 1.025 billion euro, in line with analyst expectations, while operating margins fell 1.4 percentage points to 15.6 per cent in the quarter.

 Markham added that cost savings and a move to higher priced products had more than compensated for higher input costs such as oil and other commodities, but he declined to give any outline of Unilevers hopes for the fourth quarter and 2006.

 Unilever plc shares were 2.6 per cent off at 565-1/2 pence by 0940 GMT, to be the FTSE 100 indexs biggest loser, as many analysts described the results as disappointing due to weak European trading, poor underlying sales growth and crumbling margins.

 Unilever NV shares were 2.5 per cent down at 57.65 euro.

 The numbers were OK, but there were no surprises for the upside and we are seeing profit taking after the run-up we saw earlier this week, said Michael Steib at Morgan Stanley. The company reported that underlying sales grew 3.5 per cent in the quarter, all from volume with no pricing lift, following a 3.3 per cent rise in the second quarter, while overall third-quarter sales rose 4 per cent to 10.224 billion euro.

 Unilevers 3.5 per cent rise, its fourth successive quarterly gain, was at the low end of 3.5-3.8 per cent expectations in a Reuters poll of 10 analysts.

 Calcutta, April 28: The Videocon group is setting up a Rs 200-crore IT park ? Tech City ? spread over 20 lakh square feet at its Salt Lake factory.

 ?On the excess land at our Salt Lake plant, where colour televisions, washing machines and refrigerators are manufactured, we will set up an IT park. That will be done in association with the Salarpuria Heritage group,? V. N. Dhoot, chairman of the Rs 7000-crore Videocon group, said.

 The Salarpuria group has developed over 55 lakh square feet into IT parks across the country. It is not clear if the Salarpuria group will become an equity partner.

 Dhoot said the park will house call centres and other related IT activities. ?We will provide outsourcing centres for global clients,? Dhoot added. 

 The IT park will be set up in a phased manner. The work on the first phase will start in the next six months. Out of the 11 acres at the Salt Lake factory, two acres will be used for the project.

 Videocon had bought the Salt Lake factory from Philips India for Rs 9 crore in 1999.

 ?We are happy about the work culture at the Salt Lake factory. Bengal is gaining importance on our investment map. The state is becoming an important destination for IT as well,? Dhoot said.

 Better work culture and active co-operation from the state government has prompted the Videocon group to buy the Taratolla lamp factory of Philips for Rs 1 crore. 

 The Taratolla factory was formally inaugurated by Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today. Bhattacharjee assured Dhoot of cooperation and assured him that the union at the Taratolla unit will work towards building an excellent work culture.

 The Taratolla factory, in which Videocon will invest Rs 100 crore, will produce a special type of glass shell used in picture tubes. Around 4,000 million tonnes of them will be manufactured. The shells are now made at the firm?s Bharuch factory in Gujarat. 

 In addition, the Taratolla unit will have a capacity to make 6000 personal computers (both laptop and desktop) daily. 

 ?We have imported a line from Korea, which can produce colour televisions as well as computers. So we have the flexibility of producing colour televisions and computers simultaneously. We are also coming out with a product which is a combination of a computer and a colour televisions with internet connection,? said Gautam Sengupta, chief operating officer of Taratolla and Salt Lake plants.

 GDR plan

 Videocon International, which deals with the crude oil business of the Videocon group, will float a GDR of Rs 2000 crore in June this year. The board of Videocon International has approved the GDR issue.

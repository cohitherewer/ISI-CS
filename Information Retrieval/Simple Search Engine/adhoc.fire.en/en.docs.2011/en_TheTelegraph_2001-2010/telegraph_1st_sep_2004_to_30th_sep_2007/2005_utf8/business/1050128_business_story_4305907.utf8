The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 CESC profit up 113% at Rs 32 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 27: CESC has posted a 113 per cent rise in third-quarter net profit at Rs 32 crore against Rs 15 crore in the corresponding previous period. In the nine months to December, net profit soared to Rs 121 crore against Rs 52 crore in the previous year.

 Total income for the quarter stood at Rs 554 crore against Rs 547 crore in the previous year. 

 Vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said the increase was a result of the cost containment drive that has been taken up. 

 Moreover, volume growth has offset the tariff reduction that took place in 2004-05. He added that the reduction in interest and personnel cost and containment of other operating costs contributed to the profit figures.

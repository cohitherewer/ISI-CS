 Federal Bank profit leaps113% 

 Kochi, Oct. 17 (PTI): Kerala-based Federal Bank has posted a net profit of Rs 102.84 crore for the half year ended September 30, an increase of 113.27 per cent over Rs 48.22 crore reported during the same period last year.

 The net profit for the July-September quarter this year stood at Rs 54.16 crore compared with Rs 3.19 crore for the corresponding quarter last year. Total income has increased to Rs 393.07 crore from Rs 349.74 crore in the corresponding quarter in last fiscal, the bank informed the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 This has been achieved after providing for Rs 13.84 crore towards retirement benefits over and above salary arrears paid under the national wage settlement, said the bank chairman and chief executive officer, M. Venugopalan. 

 The banks operating profit, however, stood lower at Rs 196.88 crore than Rs 223.67 crore recorded during April-September 2004. This was due to fall in profit on sale of securities during the current half year, Venugopalan said.

 But, with the support of 11.82 per cent increase in interest income, the operating profit of the bank, excluding the trading gains, inched up to Rs 179.79 crore from Rs 179.69 crore a year ago.

 Total income for the first six month of 2005-06 was at Rs 782.57 crore, up 8.35 per cent from the last years figure. The interest income for the period stood at Rs 683.75 crore showing a growth of 11.82 per cent. The net non-performing asset to net advances has come down to 1.60 per cent as on September this year which stood higher at 2.22 per cent last year.

 Venugopalan mentioned that the ratio of gross NPA to total advances declined from 6.99 per cent in September last year to 5.9 per cent this year.

 But the capital adequacy of the bank at the end of the first six months this fiscal stood diminished at 11.37 per cent against 11.7 per cent last year.

 During the reporting half year, the bank has done a total business of Rs 25,473 crore, which is Rs 4,462 crore more than Rs 21,011 crore clocked in the corresponding period last year.

 The total deposits grew to Rs 16,035.64 crore in September this year from Rs 12,839.59 crore a year ago, showing a growth rate of 16.10 per cent. Advances increased by 15.50 per cent to Rs 9,437.85 crore from Rs 8171.66 crore.

 The Banks total income went up 8.35 per cent to Rs 782.57 crore from Rs 722.24 crore and total interest income jumped 11.82 per cent at Rs 683.75 crore.

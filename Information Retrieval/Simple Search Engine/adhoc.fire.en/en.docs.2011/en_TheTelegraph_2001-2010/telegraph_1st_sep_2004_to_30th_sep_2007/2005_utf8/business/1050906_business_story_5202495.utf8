 Youth power drives Ford Fusion 

 In Top Gear

 Detroit, Sept. 5 (Reuters): Ford Motor Co is gearing up for an all-out assault on the midsize US car market with a stylish, Mexican-built sedan dubbed the Fusion that will compete against best-selling Japanese makes.

 The stakes for the second-largest US automaker are high. With sales of its large and midsize sport utility vehicles falling fast, partly due to high gasoline prices, Ford can no longer yield the passenger car segment to its Asian rivals.

 To drum up street buzz ahead of the cars debut this fall and grab the attention of young buyers, Ford is turning to the Internet and cell phones rather than traditional media advertising.

 It is using online messaging, e-mail and text messaging to reach out to young Americans, Ford Fusion launch manager Jyarland Jones said.

 Ford is also using music, holding free flash concerts featuring emerging hip-hop and rock artists. Consumers who have signed up on Fords website are notified about the location of the concerts through text messaging a few days beforehand.

 Fusions target customer is 25 to 39 years old, single or newly married and just starting to enjoy some career success, Jones said. The tag line for the car, which starts at around $18,000, is Live Life in Drive.

 What Ford is trying to do is find hyper-efficient ways to connect the name with the image of the vehicle in the marketplace prior to introduction, said Jim Sanfilippo, executive vice president at AMCI, an automotive marketing consulting firm.

 They are trying to get some notoriety to the badge itself prior to introduction, which is pivotal, he said.

 The flash concerts have been very successful with most shows packed to capacity with young, music-loving fans.

 Ford now has a list of about 500,000 consumers who are interested in knowing more about Fusion, Jones said. Fusion is Fords long-awaited answer to todays leading midsize car brands ? Toyota Motor Corps Camry and Honda Motor Co Ltds Accord.

 The sedan, which will be built at Fords Hermosillo Stamping and Assembly plant in Mexico alongside the new Mercury Milan and Lincoln Zephyr, will be filling a significant gap in Fords car line-up since its once best-selling Taurus was relegated mostly to rental car lots.

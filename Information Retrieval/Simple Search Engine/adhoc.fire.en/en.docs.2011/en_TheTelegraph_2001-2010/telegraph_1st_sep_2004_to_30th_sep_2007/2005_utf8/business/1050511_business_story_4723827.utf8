 BenQ takes a call on auto electronics

 Mumbai, May 10: From the desk to the pocket and to the living room. So, where is consumer electronics headed? Kuenyao Lee thinks he knows the answer ? to automobiles.

 As the chief executive of BenQ, the fastest-growing lifestyle technology enterprise in the world with revenues more than $10 billion, Lee should know the road to the future. 

 And, the road it is, quite literally where all the action is. ?The next leap will be to automobiles,? he says with a chuckle that shows just why BenQ is the short form of ?bringing enjoyment and quality to life?. Now, the man behind the sassy acronym is looking to turn his vision into a reality by opening talks with auto majors in the US and Taiwan to lend a dazzle to dashboards.

 ?The auto segment will symbolise a generation shift. It will take longer to gain acceptance. It is around 10 years,? Lee said. Cars fitted with BenQ?s products could, for instance, entertain and inform the driver and travellers. 

 A rice miller?s son who cut his teeth in the fiercely competitive Taiwanese electronics industry, Lee has led his company to revenues of $3.5 billion in a way that has made it one of the most ubiquitous brands around ? an unfamiliar achievement for other firms from his country. Its mobile phones, LCD monitors and joybooks (laptops) are big draws in most markets around the world.

 BenQ targets the young, but Lee says his products are increasingly getting popular with the seniors. ?The trend among the old is to look young nowadays,? he quips.

 Asked whether BenQ has a blockbuster like Sony?s Walkman or Apple?s iPod up its sleeve, Lee said the two electronic giants had made customers for far too long. His company spends nearly 4 per cent of its revenues on research. That will help it make quicker trips to the launch pad.

 BenQ has big plans for India, where it has set up a 50-strong software group that it hopes to increase to 100 by the end of this year. 

 Its plants in China, Taiwan and Malaysia will swamp the Indian market with new-age mobile phones and state-of-the-art joybooks (laptops) for customers here. The company is strong on LCDs, an area it hopes will turn out to be a money-spinner in future.

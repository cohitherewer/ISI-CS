 Relief for vanaspati makers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 5: Vanaspati manufacturers in the country have won a major relief with the government finally conceding their demand to allow them to import crude palm oil at a concessional duty of 65 per cent.

 The Union government has revised minimum carotenoid content from 500mg/kg to 250mg/kg and acid value from 2 to 4 for crude palm oil, for being eligible for the concessional rate of 65 per cent.

 This, however, will be subject to actual user conditions, i.e. for the manufacture of refined oil, refined palmolein, vanaspati, bakery shortening or inter-esterified fats only.

 The present specifications of carotenoid content (as beta carotene) of 500mg/kg to 2500mg/kg will, however, continue for crude palmolein, with a revised acid value of 4 and subject to actual user condition.

 The industry has been arguing that carotenoid is not a stable substance and tests have established that it comes down during transportation and storage. 

 Therefore, vanaspati manufacturers had been demanding that the existing condition imposed on the carotenoid content in crude palm oil and its acid value needed to be modified.

 The current specifications required the imported oil to have a carotenoid content (as beta carotene) in the range of 500mg/kg to 2500mg/kg and an acid value of 2. Such specifications were primarily prescribed to discourage import of refined palm oils in the guise of crude palm oil. 

 The industry has been representing that crude palm oil meeting carotenoid content in the prescribed range are not available in the international market, and if such oil is available, the carotenoid content gets reduced during handling and transportation.

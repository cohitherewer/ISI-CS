 More heads to roll at AIG

 Greenberg: First amp; foremost

 New York, May 16 (Reuters): American International Group Inc, under pressure from regulators probing the insurance giants accounting practices, plans to force out several senior executives, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday.

 AIG will force six or more senior executives to leave the company in the next two weeks as the probes reach beyond ousted chief executive Maurice Hank Greenberg and fired chief financial officer Howard Smith, the newspaper reported, citing people familiar with the matter.

 Current chief executive Martin Sullivan and finance chief Steven Bensinger have not been implicated in improper accounting and will not be leaving, the report said.

 But a senior AIG executive, Joseph Umansky, has agreed to co-operate with the New York attorney-general in hopes of receiving immunity from criminal prosecution or of facing lesser charges, people familiar with the matter told the Journal.

 On Saturday the New York Times reported, citing people briefed on the investigation, that Umansky had struck a deal with the attorney-general to co-operate in exchange for immunity.

 Umansky is expected to help regulators sift through questionable reinsurance transactions that AIG has said improperly altered its books.

 Umanskys lawyer said his client had no comment. An AIG spokesman also declined comment.

 AIG is under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York state attorney-generals office and the state insurance department.

 Earlier this month, AIG admitted to misleading accounting and said it would restate more than four years of financial reports, slashing $2.7 billion from its net worth.

 Investigators in New York attorney-general Eliot Spitzers office are in the early stages of drafting a civil complaint against AIG, people familiar with the matter told the Journal.

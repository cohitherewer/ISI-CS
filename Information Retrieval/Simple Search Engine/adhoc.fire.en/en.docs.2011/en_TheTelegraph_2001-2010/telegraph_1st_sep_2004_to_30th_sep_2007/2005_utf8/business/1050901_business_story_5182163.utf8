 High revenue growth for VAT states

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: The empowered committee on VAT today said 21 states, which have introduced the value-added tax, could see up to 18 per cent revenue growth in the second quarter.

 These states have recorded a 15.3 per cent revenue growth in the first quarter, followed by 12 per cent in July, Ramesh Chandra, member-secretary of the empowered committee on VAT, said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by Ficci.

 However, the panel said benefits of input credit under the VAT system are not being passed on to consumers by many manufacturers.

 If benefits from VAT are not coming my way, why should I, as a customer, favour such a tax reform? he asked.

 Chandra said there is a collusion between retailers and consumers on avoiding cash memos and invoices.

 Retailers tell consumers that if they insist on cash memos, they will have to pay VAT, said Chandra.

 The committee is in touch with the consumer affairs ministry to evolve a mechanism to monitor the prices of VAT products, he said.

 We will take up the matter (of monitoring prices) with the consumer affairs minister as well, Chandra said.

 While admitting that there are deviations from the uniform VAT rates in states, he did not agree with the Confederation of All India Traders that they are significant.

 There is more than 95 per cent uniformity in rates, he said. Some deviations might be unavoidable given the federal structure of Indian polity, said Chandra.

 Calcutta, Aug. 30: The Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) will restart the process of issuing the National Social Security Number (NSS) within a week. 

 We are expecting a communication from the central provident fund office this week on issuing the NSS numbers, said S. Raghuram, regional provident fund commissioner.

 The idea, mooted four years ago, took concrete shape last year, when the EPFO launched Project Re-Inventing EPF India to ensure efficient service for subscribers and help employers reduce compliance costs. The 14-digit National Social Security Number emerged from this initiative. This a gigantic task, taking into account the estimated 4 crore or 40 million members of the Employees Provident Fund, said Raghuram.

 The numbers were being issued at six centres in the country initially before being extended to other places after two to three months. Then, the task was halted for a while.

 EPFO had formed a committee and conducted studies on ways to turn around the organisation and make it the best-run publicly managed institution. Siemens Information Systems was preparing a report on it.

 The process is on hold now, and it has not been shelved or put on the backburner, confirmed Raghuram.

 On the inability of exempted funds to offer the mandated interest rate, Raghuram said: We are open to funds surrendering their exemption status. However, one cannot do so abruptly. One has to follow the process of auditing the accounts and transferring the securities.

 Bhilai shines in SAIL stable

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 1: Bhilai Steel Plant has again emerged as the top earner for Steel Authority of India Ltd by posting a profit before tax of Rs 4,042 crore for 2004-05. This is about 43 per cent of SAILs profit before tax of Rs 9,365 crore posted in the same period. 

 The plant reported a turnover of Rs 11,389 crore in the last financial year, stated a release issued by Bhilai Steel. 

 Bhilai Steel had reported a profit before tax of Rs 1,932 crore in 2003-04.

 Apart from favourable market conditions, Bhilais record financial performance can be attributed to a series of internal measures. 

 The plant improved finished steel production as a percentage of the total saleable steel output. It achieved a better product-mix and a higher volume of plates production. Moreover, a series of cost-cutting measures were initiated.

 Bhilai was worst hit by the coal-supply crisis because of the higher percentage of imported coal in its blend.

 Despite this, in 2004-05, the plant operated above the rated capacity (RC) with 4.51 MT hot metal at 136 per cent of RC, 4.58 MT crude steel at 117 per cent of RC and 3.94 MT saleable steel at 125 per cent of RC. 

 Although BSP was forced to reduce hot metal, crude steel and saleable steel production owing to the coal crisis, it enhanced finished steel production and reduced semis to keep the bottomline healthy. Finished steel production touched a new high of 3.20 MT, a growth of 6.2 per cent over 2003-04.

 Besides rolling out long rails last year, the plant has been the forerunner in developing products for defence use. It developed plates for Navys warships and ATM safes. 

 Apart from this, Bhilai Steel had introduced new management tools like ERP/MES. 

 The plant had enhanced the output of cast steel through the continuous casting route. 

 It also improved the production of rails and structurals, merchant products, plates and finished steel with special thrust on high-value special steel items.

 Calcutta, Feb. 27: Coal India Ltd (CIL) may surpass the production target of 314 million tonnes in the current fiscal. It expects to achieve nearly 320 million tonnes of production in 2005-06.

 The indication that CIL will surpass the production target is clear from its output figure during the April to January period of this fiscal. CIL has produced 259.27 million tonnes of coal in the reporting period against a target of 252.90 million tonnes.

 Compared with the corresponding period of previous fiscal, coal production increased by 15.2 million in absolute terms denoting a growth of 6.2 per cent.

 Coal off-take to consumers evinced an upward trend during the period under review. The offtake was 263.89 million tonnes in the April to January period against the target of 257.49 million tonnes, recording an increase of 6.4 million tonnes. Offtake increased by 15.92 million tonne over the same period of last year ? a growth of 6.4 per cent.

 The demand for coal is increasing significantly with the surge in the demand for power. This is evident from the figures of CIL. Despatch of coal to the power sector, which accounts for about 78 per cent of CIL?s overall supplies, was 204.77 million tonnes during April to January. This was 8.64 million tonnes more than the target. Compared with the same period last fiscal, the growth has been 13.66 million tonnes, registering an increase of 7.15 per cent.

 The government, in order to reduce the demand-supply gap for coal in the next few years, has initiated a process through which captive blocks allocated to private companies would be able to sell coal to the nearest public sector coal companies. 

 CIL officials said Union minister for Coal and Mines Dasari Narayana Rao has said allocation of 35 new coal blocks is expected to be finalised shortly.

 ?After a gap of more than a year, the government has commenced meetings of the screening committee for the allocation of captive blocks and about 35 coal blocks will be allotted during these meetings,? senior officials of the coal ministry said.

 The coal ministry is also looking at allowing consortium of small promoters to apply for captive coal blocks. To meet the increased demand, the productivity of CIL has been increased substantially. Productivity measured in terms of output per manshift during the review period has been 2.97 tonnes, up from the target of 2.82 tonnes.

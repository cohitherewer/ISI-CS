 Chidambaram goes slow on bank reforms

 Chidambaram: Cautious

 New Delhi, Jan. 20: A day after the Congress-led government held talks with its Left allies on foreign direct investment (FDI) in banks, finance minister P. Chidambaram announced that he would go slow on banking reforms.

 ?I am pretty slow and I ...will do it rather slowly,? Chidambaram said. Reforms were widely expected to usher in easier norms for foreign banks to take over their Indian private sector counterparts.

 Although foreign investment up to 74 per cent is allowed in Indian private banks, individual voting rights of foreign buyers are capped at 10 per cent. Besides, approval of the central banker is needed for any acquisition beyond 5 per cent and a creeping acquisition norm of 10 per cent a year is also in place.

 Multinational banks want the cap to be lifted as well as the creeping acquisition rate relaxed. While North Block was inclined to agree to this and the finance minister had indicated as much at conclaves organised by business chambers, the Left had sought a more cautious approach.

 He had yesterday promised the Left a roadmap on banking reforms and had reiterated a promise made in the Congress election manifesto that PSU banks would not be privatised.

 Chidambaram also ruled out changes in tax laws for micro-finance institutions and allowing foreign equity in the sector, but kept options open for a separate fund for them.

 ?Changes in tax laws are completely unnecessary as it would only lead to bureaucratic and legislative red tape,? he said, adding that access to foreign equity was also not required as there was no dearth of funds in the country.

 The finance minister said the government might consider a separate regulator for those micro-finance institutions, which also took deposits.

 Chidambaram argued that as banks were flush with funds but unable to lend them to small borrowers as they did not have the necessary monitoring mechanism, micro-finance institutions needed to act as intermediaries.

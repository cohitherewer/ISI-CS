 Industry seeks clarity in patents bill

 VIVEK NAIR

 Mumbai, March 20: A section of the industry has sought clarity in the amendments proposed in the patents bill introduced by the UPA government. 

 It wants the Centre to fix a ?percentage ceiling? on royalties to be paid to the patent holder in the event of compulsory licensing. 

 The wishlist also includes a clear definition of the patentable criteria, wherein only new molecules are eligible for patent protection.

 The CPM said the government had agreed to incorporate seven of the 12 amendments suggested by the Left parties in the bill. Last December, the government issued an ordinance that included pharmaceuticals and agro-chemicals in product patents. 

 For the domestic industry, the introduction of product patents meant an end to the practice of producing patented drugs using a different process.

 The Left parties had suggested that while taking recourse to compulsory licensing, a ?nominal? royalty should be paid to the original patent holder. Compulsory licences allow companies to produce a drug that is under patent to meet the public health requirements arising from an emergency or a crisis. 

 Though there appears to be some difference of opinion here with the government calling for payment of a ?reasonable? compensation, industry sources want the government to fix a ceiling on such royalties. ?The ceiling could be 5 per cent of the ex-factory price,? sources said.

 The industry is also concerned about the definition of patentable criteria as it fears that foreign companies can extend the patentability by making minor changes to drugs. ?The filing of frivolous patents by making some changes in the original patented product is one of the biggest worries,? an official from a leading company said.

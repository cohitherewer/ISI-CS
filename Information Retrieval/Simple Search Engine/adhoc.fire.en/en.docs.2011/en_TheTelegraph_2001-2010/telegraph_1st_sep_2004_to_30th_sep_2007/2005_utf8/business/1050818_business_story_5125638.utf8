 Calcutta, Aug. 17: Deutsche Messe AG, the organiser of annual ICT fair CeBIT in Hanover, is considering arranging trade fairs in India.

 Indias growth in the IT and communications segment is of immense importance and we are exploring opportunities to set up a presence here. We are also looking at possibilities in other sectors, besides ICT, Jorg Schomburg, managing director, World-wide CeBIT Events, and senior vice-president of the company said while unveiling the plans for the fair in 2006.

 The German company already has a presence in Australia, China and Istanbul and partners with local companies for various trade fairs.

 We are considering ways to enter India, said Schomburg. It could be through a joint venture with a local company, by establishing a permanent trade fair ground or setting up a subsidiary and renting grounds for the trade fair.

 Fifty-eight companies from India participated in the CeBIT exhibition last year.

 The fair next year is important as India heads the list of favourite outsourcing destinations.

 A recent study conducted by Deutsche Bank, SAP and Kaiserslautern University of Applied Sciences indicated that outsourced services from German companies was expected to rise to 17 billion euro by 2008.

 Schomburg said, The BPO segment will specially focus on the SME sector.

 The fair will also focus on the emerging technologies in mobile telephony, migration from GSM to 3G, wireless mobility and personal digital equipment.

 Bengal IT minister Manabendra Mukherjee said the 17 companies that had participated in last years CeBIT had benefited immensely. The state will decide on this years delegation in the next few months. The state had closed 18 deals in five days at the fair.

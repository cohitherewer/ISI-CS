 Calcutta, Sept. 13: Philips Electronics India Limited (PEIL) plans to expand its software business in Bangalore so that it can beef up exports from Rs 260 crore to Rs 375-400 crore by 2007.

 Philips Innovation Campus (earlier Philips Software Centre Private Limited), which has been merged with PEIL, will recruit 1,000 people more by 2007 to meet the export targets. The current headcount in the unit is 1,500.

 Philips Innovation carries out research and development of embedded software solutions, architecture designing and information system for advanced technological features in consumer products and diagonistics.

 Philips is setting up a 20000-square-feet campus in Bangalore for its software development business. We are expecting a 35 per cent growth in our software exports business, vice-chairman and managing director K. Ramachandran said.

 Philips is spending Rs 225 crore to beef up the software business. PEIL exports almost all its software to its parent company, Philips KPNV.

 Apart from Bangalore, Philips has software development centres in California, Netherlands and Shanghai. A new unit is coming up at Hungary. We have to compete with other software centres for our exports to the Dutch parent, Ramachandran said.

 PEIL expects to witness a 15 per cent growth in its overall business in the current financial year, chairman S.M. Datta told shareholders at the 75th annual general meeting of the company.

 Regarding the companys business restructuring, Ramachandran said in the past years, the company had been adopting various measures to strengthen its position in the lighting market.

 We have discontinued manufacturing at Kalwa near Mumbai in view of high costs and lower production efficiency. We are now strengthening capability at the factories in Vadodara and Mohali, he added.

 The company is emphasising more on outsourcing for its consumer electronics business so that the cost of production is maintained at lower levels. It has also closed down its consumer electronics factory at Pimpri near Pune.

 Go long on investment, save on tax

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Oct. 20: The government is likely to impose differential taxes on savings when they are withdrawn under a system where a fraction of the maturity sum will have to be paid to the central exchequer.

 Senior finance ministry officials say investments in tax-saving instruments for at least a decade ? like pension funds, provident funds or long-term infrastructure bonds ? will be taxed at a lower rate, perhaps at levels similar to the lowest income-tax slab. 

 Assets like National Savings Certificates, which mature quickly relative to others, will be taxed at a higher rate. This could be the second income-tax slab of 20 per cent. 

 The difference in rates will induce people to pick long-term investments, which are normally channelled into infrastructure, an area the government is keen to develop. 

 The ministry had made it clear in the last budget that it wanted to shift most tax-free savings towards the EET (exempt, exempt, tax) system. It even set up a five-member panel to suggest how and when this could be done. 

 Tax-free savings instruments such as PF and NSC are not taxed at all, from investments, to accrual to withdrawal. The financial jargon for this is exempt, exempt, exempt (EEE). The government now wants these to be taxed at the last stage, when the sum is withdrawn. Taxes will be deducted on these instruments before returning the money to individuals once their savings mature.

 In order to keep track of these instruments, the government could consider making it compulsory for those buying NSCs/pension plans to hold it in paperless (demat) form. 

 Officials, however, said the EET regime would only cover savings under the Rs 1-lakh tax-free limit. Amounts above it are incomes on which taxes have been paid. The idea is to restrict these to new savings. Investments made before the law is passed will remain exempt.

 Officials said the committee looking at the feasibility of EET had a basket of 90 savings instruments. While some of these, like the employees provident fund, stay out of the taxmans reach completely, there are others, like long-term bonds, on which a tax is levied at withdrawal. The principle is that all savings for a given number of years should be treated equally, regardless of the scheme you have opted for.

 Bangalore, April 20: Biocon Ltd has posted a 42 per cent rise in net profit in 2004-05 at Rs 198 crore compared with Rs 139 crore in the previous fiscal.

 The company?s revenues grew 34 per cent to Rs 728 crore from Rs 542 crore in 2003-04. Exports spiralled to Rs 442 crore from Rs 340 crore, while the domestic business increased to Rs 271 crore from Rs 201 crore. 

 ?All our key businesses ? biopharmaceuticals, enzymes and research services ? have demonstrated positive growth. The numbers have exceeded our internal profit target,? chairperson and managing director Kiran Mazumdar Shaw said.

 However, the company?s performance this fiscal will be weighed down by higher depreciation on new facilities and increased investment in research and development. 

 It has planned to increase R amp;D investment to support an aggressive research strategy. ?We believe that investing in such R amp;D is essential for long-term sustainability in our business, especially in the new WTO-TRIPS era,? Shaw said.

 Shaw did not reveal the fourth-quarter earnings, saying the business model of the biotech induswas different from that of software firms.

 ?Biotech should not be evaluated every quarter. We should be evaluated on an annualised basis. You will see lumpy growth in these kind of businesses,? Shaw said.

 The company announced a 40 per cent dividend for the year (Rs 2 per share), which takes the earnings per share to Rs 19.8.

 The chairman said the company had made significant progress in collaborative research programme for cancer vaccines and human antibodies. These would develop into global opportunities over the next three to four years.

 Clinigene, a subsidiary of Biocon, has commenced phase II human clinical trials for a monoclonal antibody to treat neck and brain cancer. The trials will be extended to cancer of pancreas, breast and lungs,? Shaw said.

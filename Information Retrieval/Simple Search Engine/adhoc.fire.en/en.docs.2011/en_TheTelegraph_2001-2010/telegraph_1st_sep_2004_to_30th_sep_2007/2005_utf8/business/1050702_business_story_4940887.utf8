 Doshi roped in to steer Anil flagship

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 1: Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprises (ADAE), the Anil Ambani-headed group trying to make its presence felt in India Inc, has appointed chartered accountant Gautam Doshi as group president.

 He will be a key member of the leadership team. Doshi will be primarily responsible for mergers and acquisitions (M amp;A) in addition to supervising tax, regulatory and accounting functions, a company statement said.

 Doshi was a senior partner at RSM amp; Co, chartered accountants, and director of Ambani Corporate Finance Pvt. Ltd. Having qualified as a chartered accountant in 1975, he earned his stripes in the initial years at Bansi S. Mehta amp; Co., where he went on to become a partner. 

 Doshi is well known for his expertise in matters related to accounting, taxation and regulatory laws such as Companies Act, corporate governance code and Fema. He has also had a significant experience in the area of corporate restructuring, and mergers and acquisitions.

 I am delighted to have Gautam on the leadership team. He is a great asset for any organisation and will add greatly to our efforts in creating value for millions of our shareholders, ADAE chairman Anil Ambani said.

 Doshi was an elected member of the central council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India from 1991 to 1998. He presented papers and led discussions on income tax, accounting and auditing, central excise and related issues. 

 He was also a former chairman of the indirect taxation committee of the Indian Merchants Chamber. He is now a partner in Gautam Doshi amp; Co and RSM amp; Co. 

 Having taken on a new executive role, Doshi is expected to resign as independent directors in several companies, though he is not obliged under the norms to do so.

 Ambuja Cement Rajasthan Limited, GP Electronics Limited, Melstar Information Technologies Limited, MIRC Electronics Limited, Piramal Enterprises Limited, Sterlite Industries (India) Limited and Sterlite Optical Technologies Limited are some of the prominent companies where the ace accountant sits on the board.

 When Reliance Energy (REL) unveiled a whistle-blower policy and a code of ethics, Doshi was directed to interact with shareholders on their suggestions and queries in his role as a senior independent director at the firm. Interestingly, he represented financial institutions. 

 Anil values his advice immensely, say sources, and the Ambani juniors respect for him as grown over the years. In the coming days, Anil will announce several senior level appointments in group firms, including Reliance Infocomm.

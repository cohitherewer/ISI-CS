 Toyota speeds along US track

 Detroit, Nov. 19 (Reuters): Toyota Motor Corp grabbed more retail market share than Ford Motor Co in the US in early November and it was less than one share point behind General Motors Corp, J.D. Power and Associates said on Friday.

 A report from the industry-tracking firms closely watched Power Information Network said GM had the highest retail market share in the first 13 days of November at 18.8 per cent.

 However, retail share at the worlds largest automaker was down 24 per cent from the same period a year ago, and Toyota was breathing on its shoulder with a retail share of 17.9 per cent. Toyota, Japans largest automaker, had a 15.4 per cent share of the US retail market a year earlier.

 The report said Ford, which has seen its retail sales decline 30 per cent from the year-ago period, placed a distant third with a US retail share of 15.3 per cent.

 GM and Ford both reported 23 per cent declines in their sales in the country last month, as high gasoline prices hurt demand for their big sport utility vehicles and industrywide sales fell to their slowest pace in seven years.

 DaimlerChrysler was in the fourth place in early November, with a retail share of 13.6 per cent, while Honda Motor Co. Ltd. took the number 5 spot (12.2 per cent).

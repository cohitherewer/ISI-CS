 Tata Teleservices faces licence heat

 - Telecom firms Gear up to face Rate Rejig

 New Delhi, Jan. 9 (PTI): The department of telecom (DoT) has issued a showcause notice to Tata Teleservices, seeking an explanation of alleged violation of licence conditions by the company on its fixed-line wireless phone service ?walky?.

 Tata Teleservices has positioned the ?walky? phone as a ?mobile phone? on landline rates. BSNL has objected to the campaign. 

 According to the regulation, private companies are liable to pay a levy called access deficit charge (ADC) on mobile telecom services to BSNL. 

 According to sources, the DoT sent the notice to the private operator on January 7 and has asked the company to answer its queries. The DoT has taken the step after BSNL objected to Tata?s campaign about their ?walky? phone.

 The interconnect usage charges and ADC regime provide different treatment for calls from mobile and fixed services, including wireless fixed.

 Asked if the DoT was considering imposing penalty on Tatas for violating the licence terms and conditions, sources said, ?Not at this stage and the showcause notice has been issued only to seek an explanation.?

 Trai has also issued a directive to the Tatas as well as Reliance Infocomm that they withdraw their advertisements on walky and unlimited cordless respectively.

 ?It has been brought to the notice of the authority that Tata Teleservices has advertised its fixed wireless service as walky with the slogan freedom of mobility at landline rates Trai is of the view that the advertisement with the slogan is misleading as consumers are led to believe that mobile services are offered when actually they are fixed wireless services, quot; the directive said.

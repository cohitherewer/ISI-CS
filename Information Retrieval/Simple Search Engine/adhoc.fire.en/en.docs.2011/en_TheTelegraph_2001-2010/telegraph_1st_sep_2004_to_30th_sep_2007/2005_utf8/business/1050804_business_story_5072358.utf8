 End to pillion-ride for Hero infotech wing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 3: The Hero group today spun off HeroITES, its four-year old infotech-enabled services unit, as an independent company. The new company will launch an initial public offering by the middle of next year. It is also on the look out for acquisitions.

 ?We have grown at close to 100 per cent in the last two years and have attained a reasonable size,? said Sunil Kant Munjal, MD and CEO of HeroITES. 

 HeroITES wants to grow organically at over 100 per cent over the next two years. 

 ?We have also ramped up our sales and marketing initiatives across the US and Europe,? Munjal added. 

 Explaining the need to hive off HeroITES as a separate entity, he said, ?the company is doing very well. Consequently, the Hero group felt that it was the right time to hive off HeroITES into an independent firm, as it was no longer necessary to lend management support to it.?

 ?Since we are ready to stand on our own now and have lined up plans for an IPO, besides being on the lookout for large acquisitions, we want to create a vehicle to be more focussed in the call-centre and BPO businesses,? said Nilesh Kothari, vice-president, business development and finance.

 HeroITES was also open to investments from private equity investors, Kothari added.

 Munjal will continue to be actively involved in the operations of the company as MD and CEO. The company has outlined a ?comprehensive business strategy to be among the top five-business process outsourcing firms in the country by 2007?. 

 A senior management team is already in the US to woo major clients. As part of the growth strategy, the company will aggressively look for acquisitions in identified markets and double its headcount to 2,000 employees in the next one-year.

 HeroITES will target profitable companies with revenues below $100 million and a sound management team.

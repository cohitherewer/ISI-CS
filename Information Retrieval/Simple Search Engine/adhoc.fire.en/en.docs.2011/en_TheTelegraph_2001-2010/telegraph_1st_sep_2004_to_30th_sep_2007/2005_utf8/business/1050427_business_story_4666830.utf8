 New Delhi, April 26: The 21 states that have switched over to the value-added tax (VAT) regime today agreed to adopt uniform rates for industrial inputs and capital goods even as they waived the levy on essential commodities like medicines, salt, bread and food items sold through the public distribution system. 

 The notifications are expected to be issued by the end of this month.

 ?It has been possible to arrive at a full consensus among states on the convergence of VAT rates. All states will come out with notifications on the rates by the end of this month,? Asim Dasgupta, chairman of the empowered committee on VAT, told reporters after a meeting of state finance ministers here today. Eight states, including five under BJP rule, have refused to implement VAT.

 Medicines, medical equipment and devices will attract 4 per cent VAT. 

 ?The empowered committee will form a view on what is to be included in the category of life-saving drugs,? he said.

 ?Diesel and petrol will be out of VAT, while LPG may attract the tax, quot; he said.

 Dasgupta said industrial inputs and capital goods will attract VAT at 4 per cent. He, however, added there would be a small list of capital goods like building materials which would be exempted. Final goods will attract VAT at 12.5 per cent. 

 Essential items like branded and unbranded salt, bread, gur, jaggery and all food items distributed through the public distribution system will be exempted. 

 The anomalies in VAT rates between states had led to protests by traders and industry.

 The VAT panel also decided to request all 21 states to converge VAT on tea at 4 per cent. Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa had imposed a 12.5 per cent VAT on tea, sparking concern in the tea industry which stood in danger of losing some of its most lucrative markets. Maharashtra alone consumes 60 million kg of tea out of the total domestic consumption of 650 million kg.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram told the state finance ministers that a compensation package would be ready within a few days. The Centre has provided Rs 5,000 crore for the implementation of VAT and promised 100 per cent compensation in the first year to states that suffer revenue loss after switching over to the new tax regime. 

 In the second year, states would be compensated by 75 per cent of the revenue loss; it would be 50 per cent in the third year.

 Tax paid for exports to be refunded within three months. 

 Traders have to issue bills to get input tax credit.

 Midcaps miss the action

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 25: The rally in the sensex seems to have bypassed the small and midcap stocks. While the sensex has reached a new high, the BSE small cap and mid cap indices are still some way below their highs.

 The BSE mid cap index closed at 4123.51 today, well below its high of 4365.71 reached on September 19. Nevertheless, the relief for investors is that the index is now 12 per cent above its low on October 28. 

 Similarly, the BSE small cap index closed at 5555.21, well below the high of 6394.20 it reached on September 19. However, this index too has gone up 14 per cent from the depths it plumbed on October 28.

 Brokers say that while the small and mid cap stocks have lagged the rally so far, some of the liquidity that has fuelled the rise in the large caps should now spill over to smaller stocks.

 The initial move upward is always in the frontline stocks, said a hedge fund manager. It is only later that investors target the riskier midcap stocks.

 Others point out that FIIs now research midcaps on a regular basis. A lot of punters in small cap stocks were badly bruised during last months crash, said a broker. It will be some time before they recover.

 Well-known international research firm BCA Research, however, has a different explanation. In a recent report on global equities, it has pointed out that while robust profit growth, liquidity and low interest rates had disproportionately favoured small caps over their larger counterparts ever since the current global rally in equities began in 2003, in recent weeks, small caps stocks have lagged although the global equity index has hit a new high. 

 BCA Research believes this indicates that a change in leadership is under way, as investors become more cautious in view of more monetary tightening ahead. 

 The recovery in the sensex also brings out the divergent sectoral trends. For instance, while the BSE IT index has been consistently scaling new highs this month, the BSE metals index, which closed 5845.61 today is far below its high of 7227.48. Similarly, the BSE Bankex at 4849.79, is also well below its high of 5192.49.

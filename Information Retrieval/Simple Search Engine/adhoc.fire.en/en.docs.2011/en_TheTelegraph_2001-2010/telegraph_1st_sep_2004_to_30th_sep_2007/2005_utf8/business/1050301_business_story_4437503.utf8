 Mutual funds glitter

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 28: The budget proposal to allow gold exchange traded funds could prod millions of people to shift their annual savings of Rs 5000 crore through the informal channel of jewellers and bullion traders to a better-regulated mutual fund industry.

 ?Ten years ago, we embarked on the process of ensuring that gold inflows are through the official channels alone. I believe that we are now in a position to introduce ?gold units? and create a market for such units,? finance minister P. Chidambaram said.

 Ten per cent of all Indian household savings is in gold, while equity has only a 2 per cent share.

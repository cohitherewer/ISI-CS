 ONGC profit jumps 22%

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Oct. 26: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, the state-run oil producer, today reported a 22.29 per cent increase in earnings for July-September despite dishing out Rs 2,827 crore to the oil marketing companies ? Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum ? on account of its LPG and kerosene subsidy burden. 

 ONGC clocked Rs 4,138.25 crore net profit for the second quarter ended September 30 compared with Rs 3383.87 crore in the same period last year. Total income grew 10.20 per cent to Rs 13,543.31 crore for the quarter from Rs 12,289.29 crore in the year-ago period.

 The subsidy pay-out was made through a discount of $17.27 per barrel of crude oil sold to the marketing companies. This works out to Rs 5,674 per tonne. The corresponding discount figure for the first quarter was $16.20 per barrel as prices of LPG and kerosene were lower during this period.

 ONGCs crude oil output fell to 5.44 million tonnes during the second quarter from 5.81 million tonnes in the first quarter due to the tragic blaze that destroyed the Mumbai High platform in July. Natural gas production also declined to 5.01 billion cubic metres from 5.13 billion cubic metres in the previous quarter. 

 Asian Paints 

 Asian Paints Ltd today registered a 25.34 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 61.17 crore for the quarter ended September 30 compared with Rs 48.80 crore a year ago. The board of directors has recommended an interim dividend of 45 per cent, or Rs 4.50 per equity share of Rs 10 each, for the year 2005-06.

 Laffer at the core of tax gamble

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Money matters

 New Delhi, March 1: It is a gamble that finance minister P. Chidambaram has taken once too often: it is predicated on the belief that tax cuts will ensure better compliance.

 If the Laffer Curve theory ? lower tax rates bring higher revenue ? works, he will be a hero on Dalal Street. If it doesn?t, India will face bigger deficits, steadily rising inflation and stifled industrial growth. In 1997, when he first tried the gamble, it backfired with huge fiscal imbalances. 

 The end result this time too could be just the same: a bloated fiscal deficit, rising inflation and industry crowded out of the debt market as government borrowings surge.

 After the euphoria of tax cuts evaporated and the analysts pored over the fine print, the verdict was pretty stark: Chidambaram is walking a tightrope of revenue expectations. One false step, and the government could be financially worse off than before.

 Chidambaram is betting on an unprecedented 20.9 per cent growth in gross tax revenues. He is banking mostly on huge excise and corporate tax growth. Both look extremely difficult. A 17.3 per cent or Rs 20,800 crore increase is being projected in excise collections. Historically, excise growth has been in the range of 6-12 per cent. 

 An even steeper corporate tax growth of 33 per cent is being budgeted. Although corporate profitability has increased, it remains a tough target to achieve.

 Excise and corporation taxes are the two biggest revenue grossers and bring in 38 per cent of the total tax and non-tax revenue. A shortfall in these two major taxes could mean red ink splashed all over the annual accounts card.

 S. P. Gupta, former member of the Planning Commission, said: ?Tax reforms result in lower revenues in the first few years. If that happens, the fiscal deficit target of 4.3 per cent goes for a six ... my own calculations is that it will be nearer to 5 per cent.? Then the 5 per cent inflation rate being assumed by government economists will rise to 6-7 per cent. 

 The government is banking on an 8-8.3 per cent real GDP growth rate. The manufacturing sector is unlikely to grow at the 8.9 per cent. Any slippages in industrial growth would mean a slower GDP growth, with a fall-out on taxes. ?It is a vicious cycle and he knows it,? Gupta said. 

 ?If there are revenue slippages, the government borrowings will go up,? he added.

 Standard amp; Poors has criticised the budget for not reducing the deficit. Chidambaram could, however, be saved from this, if government departments manage to do what they did this year: Underspend. He may well hope the higher outlay would result in a lower spending ratio.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 A-I looks at flotation of 25%

 SATISH JOHN

 Mumbai, June 6: Air-India (A-I) will begin a fresh valuation exercise ahead of an initial public offer (IPO) that could prune the government?s holding by up to 25 per cent instead of the originally planned limit of 15 per cent.

 ?Our assets and size have dramatically changed in the last few years,? chairman and managing director V. Thulasidas told The Telegraph. 

 The small equity base of Rs 153 crore that the airline has been operating with for several years does not adequately reflect the scale of operations, he said. Even the authorised capital of Rs 500 crore is low, he added. This is a sign the airline would raise its equity, perhaps through a bonus issue, to reward the government before the flotation. ?We will go through our balance sheet with a tooth-comb,? he added.

 Air-India will not be influenced by revaluation exercises carried out as part of the divestment drill under the NDA government. ?I am not going by that valuation. Even the assets have changed since then, the size of the company has grown significantly and the revenue figures have shot up substantially,? Thulasidas said.

 The divestment of A-I to a strategic partner was mired in controversies, which forced bidders to back off. This time, the civil aviation ministry has earmarked 15 per cent of the airline?s equity for the public. That figure, Thulasidas says, could go up to 20-25 per cent. 

 The merchant banker for the public issue, to be appointed soon, will help the airline increase the size of equity. Asked whether it will be through a generous pre-IPO bonus, Thulasidas said the management would keep its options open on the matter. ?We haven?t decided yet.?

 Banks are also ready to fund new acquisitions by the carrier. Export credit agencies offer 85 per cent of the cost of buyouts as loan; the rest comes from internal accruals.

 However, Thulasidas says A-I is likely to use the IPO cash because that will help it bringing down borrowing costs.

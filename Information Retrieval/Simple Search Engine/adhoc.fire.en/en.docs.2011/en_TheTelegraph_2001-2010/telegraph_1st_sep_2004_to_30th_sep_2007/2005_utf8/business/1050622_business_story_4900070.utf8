The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Test for the brothers in retail foray

 SATISH JOHN

 Mumbai, June 21: The agreement holding back the Ambani brothers from entering into ventures that pit them against each other is restricted to existing lines of business.

 The non-compete agreement, as the pact is called in corporate parlance, leaves out areas the two brothers might plan to tap in the future. The period of the understanding is five years; some are of the view that it is 10.

 At present, the Mukesh-run Reliance Industries has interests in petrochemicals, oil exploration and refining. The Anil-spawned Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprises has a presence in power, financial services and telecom.

 If the pact is followed in its letter, both camps will be free to start businesses they do not run now. That could well see them turn rivals in the market.

 One area where this situation could arise is retailing, a sector both groups appear to be enamoured of. 

 Mukesh, having lost Infocomm, is looking at another project that could give him the reach and challenge he savoured when he built up the telecom major from scratch.

 Sources say he is fine-tuning his strategy before making a big splash. In all probability, he will take to organised retail, which promises unprecedented growth.

 Anil has also been weighing similar plans, say sources. He is believed to have built bridges with Wal-Mart chief, who only recently made an eventful trip to India.

 Nothing much is known about the discussions but Anil, who wants his group to expand immediately in size and scale, is unlikely to shy away from a profitable proposition. Sources close to him, however, deny he is planning anything new and, instead, insist he has his plate full.

 Mukesh, on the other hand, is likely to count on Manoj Modi, his close associate and the man who had the drive to implement gargantuan projects like Infocomm. He could be tapped for retail, though sources did not confirm it.

 There are some indications Reliance Industries will pump in up to Rs 30,000 crore over the next five years into a mega-retail chain spread across 100 cities in the country. 

 On Sunday, Anil said he would invest around Rs 3000 crore in Reliance Capital and Reliance Energy. He also revealed plans to take up mega-infrastructure projects. These include the two airport projects in Mumbai and Delhi and the two arterial transport systems in Mumbai. Both will require huge sums of money ? analysts say it could run into thousands of crore.

 Sources say the Mukesh-led RIL will not bid or compete in these ventures.

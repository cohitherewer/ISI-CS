 Two-day shutdown at Maruti facility

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 18: Maruti Udyog Limited will close its facility in Gurgaon for two days this month.

 The company has cited inventory pile-up as the reason for the closure. Car sales in March had been lower than predicted, resulting in inventory accumulation.

 ?Maruti?s facility in Gurgaon will be closed on March 19 and 25. Production on a given day is about 2000 cars,? a company spokesperson said. 

 The company had earlier planned to jack up production for March, anticipating that the budget would reduce duty, bringing down car prices and spurring sales. But since that did not happen, Maruti was forced to scale down production.

 The company said such shutdown is within the ?frame of holiday re-allignment?.

 Maruti said despite being closed for two days, the company will achieve the highest ever monthly sales in March. Of late, most passenger car companies have announced a price hike due to an increase in steel price.

 Maruti too will increase the prices, but the quantum of increase will be known only by March-end.

 However, falling sales of Maruti 800 is one of the key concerns of the company. Its February sales dropped 41 per cent.

 Recent industry studies have shown a rise in passenger car demand. However, sales took a dip in February as consumers had postponed their purchase decision through that month in the hope of post-budget price cuts. The budget, however, failed to lower excise duty on cars to 16 per cent, in line with that on trucks and bikes, from 24 per cent.

 Gateway ready with maiden public offer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 5: Gateway Distriparks Ltd (GDL), a leading port-related container freight station operator, is ready to launch an initial public offering (IPO) of 2.1 crore shares. The price band for the issue has been set at Rs 60-72.

 The offer comprises a fresh issue of 1.1 crore shares and an offer for sale of 1 crore shares by shareholders of the company. The offer would represent 28 per cent of the fully-diluted post-issue paid-up capital of GDL.

 The issue opens on March 9 and closes on March 14. GDL will be the first private sector operator to be listed on the bourses.

 The proceeds of the IPO will be used to repay the bridge loan from IDFC, to part-finance expansion of existing facilities at CFS, Navi Mumbai, and to fund acquisitions of business/assets and strategic initiatives.

 Of the 2.1-crore equity shares, up to 10.5 million will be allocated to qualified institutional buyers, at least 5.25 million will go to non-institutional bidders and a minimum 5.25 million shares will be for retail individual bidders.

 The company was promoted jointly by the Singapore-based Windmill group, Parameswara Holdings Ltd and Thakral group and Indian partners, Prism International Pvt Ltd and Prem Kishan Gupta. 

 IDFC and Aranda Investments (Mauritius) Pte, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Singapore-based Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd, own around 19 per cent and 10 per cent stake in the company, respectively.

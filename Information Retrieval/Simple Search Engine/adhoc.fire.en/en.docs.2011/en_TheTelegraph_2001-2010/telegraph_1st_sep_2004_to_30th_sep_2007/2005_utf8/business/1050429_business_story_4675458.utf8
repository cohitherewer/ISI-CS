 Chidambaram: Don?t worry

 New Delhi, April 28: The finance ministry wants to achieve twin objectives through the Reserve Bank?s (RBI) credit policy: reduce the impact of inflationary pressures in the economy, which has been building up because of rising oil prices, and at the same time, keep interest rates stable to give industry a breather.

 The reverse repo or short-term rate hike, which RBI governor Y. V. Reddy ordered in consultation with the finance ministry top brass, is expected to help contain the speed of money flow or the rate at which money circulates in the economy.

 This is expected to act as a cushion against the petrol-led inflationary pressures, which finance ministry reports as well as the RBI has been warning the government against. Finance minister P. Chidambaram acknowledged this fact without admitting as much when he said, ?Oil continues to be a concern.? The minister, however, promised that ?we will take every step to maintain price stability?.

 Officials are confident that the quarter percentage point increase in the reverse repo rate will not lead to any significant rise in interest rates. After the RBI policy was announced, Chidambaram said, ?The assumption that an increase in reverse repo by 25 basis points will have an immediate impact on bank lending rate is not correct.?

 But the overall impact will not affect the momentum in either industrial credit offtake or the boom in the housing sector. Industrial credit has grown by a phenomenal 26.5 per cent compared with 18.4 per cent last year. 

 The government?s fear of interest rates hardening too much stems not only from a desire to see unimpeded industrial growth, which it hopes will be somewhere between 7.5 per cent and 8.5 per cent, but also a desire to keep its own borrowing costs within manageable limits.

 The problem is that this year, the government has to borrow virtually double of what it borrowed last year on a net basis. The net government market borrowings was Rs 46,050 crore last year. 

 The higher borrowing programme, which is the result of the government deciding to push the pause button on the fiscal responsibility act and increased industrial credit should lead not only to higher interest rates but a spike in inflation. 

 However, Chidambaram said, ?We may not borrow as much as indicated in the budget. Our calculations now show that we may have to borrow less than that. The government was to borrow Rs 10,000 crore in the first week of May. But in fact, we will restrict our borrowing to Rs 8000 crore.?

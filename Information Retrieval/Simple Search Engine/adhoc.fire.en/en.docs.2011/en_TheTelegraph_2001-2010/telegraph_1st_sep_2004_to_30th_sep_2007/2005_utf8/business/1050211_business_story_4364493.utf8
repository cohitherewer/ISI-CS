 New Delhi, Feb. 10: Indias first national spot exchange for agriculture produce will open in the next three months.

 The first stab at the virtual mandi for farm products was made today with the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) among the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation (Nafed) and Financial Technologies (India) Ltd (FTIL).

 State Bank of India will act as the principal clearing and settlement bank for the exchange. The MoU was signed in the presence of Sharad Pawar, minister of agriculture, consumer affairs, food and public distribution.

 Pawar said the creation of electronic National Spot commodity market is a step in the right direction. The advantage of this market is that it will provide referral national spot prices on real-time basis for the benefit of farmers.

 The government has already removed restrictions in futures trading in various commodities and the integration of spot marketing with futures trading will open up a single commodity marketplace for farmers, say farm analysts. 

 When the national spot exchange for agriculture produce becomes functional, it will allow the commodity traders to trade in commodities at current prices. All commodities trading in the country takes place in the futures only at present.

 When the spot exchange begins operations, farmers will be able to stay abreast with the market prices through their contact with MCX offices ? either directly or through the Internet or phone.

 Pawar said the introduction of national-level electronic spot market facility for agricultural commodities marked a milestone in agricultural marketing in line with the emphasis given by the Prime Minister to establish a national-level common market for farmers with least cost.

 The government is also planning to introduce a legislation to make warehouse receipts a negotiable instrument to attract increased lending by banks for the agriculture sector, the minister said.

 Meanwhile, the first day of futures trading in crude oil at the MCX saw impressive trading volume that was equal to 1 per cent of the trading quantum at the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex).

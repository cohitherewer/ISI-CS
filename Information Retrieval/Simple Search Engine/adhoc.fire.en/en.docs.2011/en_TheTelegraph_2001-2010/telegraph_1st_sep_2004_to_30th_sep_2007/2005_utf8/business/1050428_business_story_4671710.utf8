 Calcutta, April 27: The Singapore Real Estate and Hospitality Mission is keen on exploring options for investments and projects in India.

 ?Some Singapore-based real estate companies are already operating in India. After constructing IT parks in Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai and Gurgaon, Ascendas is keen on setting up a similar park in Calcutta,? said Alan Tan, centre director, International Enterprise Singapore and First Secretary Commercial, Singapore High Commission. He was speaking at a meeting of Singapore and Calcutta-based real estate companies organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 Ascendas had planned to set up an IT park on a 20-acre land with an investment of Rs 280-300 crore. ?Keppelland is also interested in real estate development and wants to set up an office in Calcutta. The company is primarily interested in setting up integrated mini townships,? added Tan.

 The delegation from Singapore comprised six companies keen on establishing a presence in the country. They are also interested in tying up with local counterparts, Tan said.

 Besides developing real estate properties in the country, Acres Venture is also keen on setting up a real estate fund in association with some local partner. ?We are in talks with several companies, including Fire real estate fund, and expect to take a decision within six months. Our initial plan is to set up a real estate investment fund of $10-50 million,? said company representative Justin Tan Kok Hiong.

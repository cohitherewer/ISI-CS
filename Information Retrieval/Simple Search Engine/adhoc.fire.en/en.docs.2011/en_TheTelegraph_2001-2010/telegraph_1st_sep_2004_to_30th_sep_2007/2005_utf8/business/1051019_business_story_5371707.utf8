 Tata takes leadership call at telecom firm

 Tata: Taking charge

 Mumbai, Oct. 18: Ratan Tata today took over as the chairman of Tata Teleservices. He took the baton from outgoing chief Firdose Vandrewala 

 The move comes at a time when the company is trying to sign up more subscribers in the fast-growing mobile and fixed line telephony market. The Tatas have so far invested over Rs 18,000 crore in their telecom lynchpin. It aims to raise this to over Rs 31,000 crore by 2007. 

 Vandrewala, who recently resigned as managing director of Tata Power and forced Adi Engineer to come out of retirement to manage the day-to-day affairs of the power utility, had reportedly cited personal reasons for quitting. A few eyebrows were raised when he left Tata Power, a company he joined after Tata Steel. 

 Vandrewala had pulled all stops to get Tata Teleservices going in its initial phase. But attempts to differentiate the company from the other players failed. Among the setbacks were the ?push to talk? fiasco and the recent court face-off over Tata Walky.

 There is also a talk of getting on board a strategic investor and some speculate that South Korea Telecom could be the one.

 Ratan Tata takes the top job at Tata Teleservices after his resignation as the chairman of VSNL. Subodh Bhargava is the new chairman of VSNL, which has a minority stake in Tata Tele. The major stakeholders are Tata group companies ? Tata Sons, Tata Industries and Tata Power.

 Tata Tele has rolled out its network in 1,000 cities within a span of nine months since it went national in 2003.

 The company has plans to increase its presence to 1500 cities shortly. It also has drawn up an ambitious plan to double its subscriber base to 10 million in the next two-three months.

 To reach that target, the telecom service provider has announced a scheme offering prepaid subscribers receive calls free for two years without refilling their vouchers if they buy any of the four handsets it has earmarked for the scheme. 

 Since the beginning of this year, the company has more than doubled its subscriber base, which is set to cross six million this month.

 Analysts believe Ratan Tata?s direct involvement in the telephony venture will speed up translating his vision of leadership in the telecom market to a reality more quickly than anyone can.

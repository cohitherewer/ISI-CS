 More cash in co-op revival kitty

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Relief at hand

 New Delhi, Dec. 30: A high-powered committee headed by A. Vaidyanathan has proposed a Rs 4839-crore revival package for the long-term co-operative credit structure.

 The Centre will provide the technical assistance required and bear the losses on account of agricultural loans. However, losses suffered on account of non-agricultural loans will be shared by respective state governments and co-operative societies.

 Y.S.P. Thorat, managing director of Nabard and member secretary of the panel, said the Centre should provide assistance for the accumulated losses on account of farm loans amounting to Rs 2,293 crore, while the states and co-operatives should take the burden for non-agri loans amounting to about Rs 570 crore. 

 In addition, the panel has recommended that the centre should also extend technical assistance for special audit, computerisation and implementation cost amounting to about Rs 164 crore.

 A contingency fund of Rs 1,500 crore has also been suggested to provide cover for any short-provisioning.

 The task force, which submitted its draft report to the government yesterday, is expected to present the final report in a month. The panels recommendations come barely a fortnight after the government approved a Rs 13,596-crore package for short-term co-operative credit structure.

 The long-term structure provides only long-gestation investment loans for agriculture, non-farm sector and housing to rural population.

 Overall, the system has about 2,500 retail outlets serving 1.56 crore members and now disburses about Rs 3,200 crore annually for investments such as irrigation, mechanisation, farm animals, rural industries and houses. Its aggregate loan outstanding is over Rs 16,000 crore. The system has, however, been making losses in general and its accumulated losses across states aggregate Rs 2,900 crore.

 The committee also favoured allowing state-level co-operative banks to mobilise deposits on the lines of non-bank finance companies and diversify its portfolio into both short-term and long-term credit.

 Vaidyanathan said the existing system suffers from a serious design defect as it extends only a single product loan. 

 These entities, also known as agriculture rural development banks (ARDBs), are also heavily dependent on borrowings with over 90 per cent of its resources coming as loans from Nabard under government guarantee.

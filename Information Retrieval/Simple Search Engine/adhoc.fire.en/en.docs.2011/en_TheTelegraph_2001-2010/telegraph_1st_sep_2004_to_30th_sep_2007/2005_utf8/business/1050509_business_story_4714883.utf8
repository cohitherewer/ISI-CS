The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Q amp;A

 In search of clue

 Iam going to retire from service and shall receive my provident fund, gratuity and leave salary amount. Are these amounts taxable or is there any investment opportunity that will allow tax exemption on these amounts?

 M. S. Deb, Calcutta

 The amount received from provident fund continues to be tax exempt. However, the tax treatment of gratuity and leave salary amount depends on whether you are a government employee or not. These amounts shall be added to your total income and you can save tax by following the prescribed tax saving investment norms.

 Friend in need

 I have recently retired from service. Can you suggest some suitable but dependable deposit schemes where I can invest my savings? 

 P. Biswas, by e-mail

 Investment decisions should be taken based on your 

 risk appetite and returns expectations. If you want 

 fixed income, you can opt for various post office small 

 savings schemes like MIS, Kisan Vikas Patra, National 

 Savings Scheme. If you are above 60, you can also invest 

 in the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme. You can also opt 

 for company fixed deposits. But dont get tempted 

 by too high interest rates and try and invest in schemes 

 with high credit ratings, on which you should again 

 keep a watch. If you are ready to take some risk, you 

 can also look at mutual funds, the choice of which will 

 again depend on your level of comfort in investing in 

 equities.

 Unscathed till now

 I have opened a Public Provident Fund account as interest on the deposit is exempt from tax. Now with the withdrawal of exemptions under section 88 and 80L from the current year, will the interest on deposits made up to March 31, 2005 continue to be tax free? Has the special tax rebate of up to Rs 20,000 available to senior citizens been withdrawn?

 Sanjib Banerjee, Calcutta

 Interest on PPF deposit shall not be affected by the 

 withdrawal of section 88 or 80L. It will only be affected 

 if and when the government introduces Exempt Exempt 

 Taxable (EET) system of taxation. The tax rebate of 

 Rs 20,000 for senior citizens has been withdrawn from 

 the current financial year. However, the basic exemption 

 limit for them has been increased to Rs 1,85,000.

 Markets raise a toast to numbers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 11: A volatile market today gave a thumbs-up to the better-than-expected quarterly earnings from Infosys Technologies. This was evident from the 57-point gain notched up by the sensex at the close of a choppy session, thus putting an end to the losses suffered for four days in a row.

 While Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) declared its quarterly results after the markets closed for the day, the numbers posted by Infosys and its upward revision in revenue guidance made investors confident of a good report card from the other technology firm. And TCS did not let them down with a net profit of Rs 694 crore.

 Brokers said the bourses are likely to begin on a strong note on Thursday due to the good show put up by TCS.

 The numbers posted by both Infosys and TCS look good. It is positive considering that the last quarter was not that encouraging. The results show that the overall trend is positive for the domestic IT sector. Though valuations at the current levels may be on the higher side, it is not worrying, said Apurva Shah of ASK Raymond James.

 The sensex opened higher at 8547.95 against the previous close of 8483.86. It touched an intra-day low of 8381.96 as equities surrendered their gains over concerns of a slowdown in FII activity. However, the 30-share BSE index ended the day at 8540.56 against yesterdays close of 8483.86, a net rise of 56.70 points or 0.67 per cent.

 Rupee slides

 The rupee today tumbled to over 10-1/2-month closing lows of Rs 44.88 per dollar in the interbank foreign exchange market. The currency was pulled down by sustained hectic dollar demand amid reduced supplies, following lingering concerns over foreign portfolio investment outflows.

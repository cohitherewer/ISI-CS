 Kanoria: Big plans

 Calcutta, June 6: Srei Infrastructure Finance Limited will offer the newly-launched India Global Competitive Fund through private placement of up to Rs 1,000 crore.

 We want to equip domestic companies to expand their operations and be globally competitive, said Hemant Kanoria, managing director and vice-chairman of Srei Infrastructure Finance Limited.

 Kanoria said though no specific sector has been selected, the focus would be on core manufacturing industries, based on their requirements and investment proposal.

 The fund will be managed by Srei Venture Capital Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Srei Infrastructure Finance. The minimum capital commitment for each contributor in the fund is Rs 50 crore.

 It is a close-ended fund with a 10-year tenure and a corpus of Rs 1000 crore, of which Rs 220 crore has already been committed by various banks and institutions. Srei is currently approaching other banks, financial institutions and potential investors to raise the corpus. The commitment period for contributors has been fixed at 3 years beginning from the date of final closing.

 Although we are currently in talks with domestic banks and institutions, we may also approach overseas and international financial institutions, added Kanoria.

 The fund will provide financing through a variety of instruments like equity, equity-linked instruments and mezzanine debt. The venture capital firm has formed an Investment Committee to decide on investments. All investments will be subject to the guidelines adopted by the committee.

 With India emerging as one of the most favoured business destinations globally, companies are scaling up their operations through rapid expansion of their capacities through organic and inorganic growth. Most of these companies will need access to finance such activities, said Kanoria.

 Srei Infrastructure Finance operates in infrastructure equipment, infrastructure project and renewable energy financing. The company has a network of 33 branches within the country and has expanded its operations to the UK, Germany and Russia.

 Calcutta, Sept. 21: United Spirits ? the entity that liquor baron Vijay Mallya plans to create with the merger of four group companies later this year ? is planning a brand cull.

 United Spirits will have 140 brands after the merger of McDowell, Herbertsons, Triumph Distillers and Shaw Wallace but it plans to retain just 50 to 60 of the most promising ones. As part of the brand rationalisation that is planned, Mallya intends to phase out a few brands and sell or license some others.

 Mallya, chairman of the UB Group, said 30 brands, which include 15 millionaire brands, contribute 90 per cent of groups sales.

 There is a case for rationalisation of brands which will be taken up on an urgent basis. We may phase out some of them. A few will be licensed to earn royalty and achieve continuous growth, Mallya told reporters at Wallace House today.

 However, the process will be taken up in 2006 as the companies have supply commitments in various states.

 At present, the group is fully focused on giving shape to United Spirits and undertaking the operational merger of Shaw Wallace (SWC) and the rest of the group companies. The process will be completed by October.

 SWC, which held its annual general meeting today, will remain a separate corporate entity for the time being.

 There are some pending issues that need to be addressed with regard to SWC. Once this is done, we will look into merging the corporate entity of SWC into United Spirits, Mallya said.

 United Spirits

 Mallya will hold a 52 per cent economic stake and a 44 per cent voting stake in United Spirits. 

 The ownership patterns of all the companies will lead to a structure like this, Mallya said. The merged entity is going to be valued at Rs 5,000 crore to Rs 6,000 crore. KPMG and Hari Bhakti amp; Company have done the valuation of the assets, while Ambit Corporate Finance was the adviser. UB is likely to unfold more details about the merger, including the relative valuation and swap ratio, tomorrow.

 Overseas buyouts

 After gobbling up SWC for Rs 1,545 crore, Mallya said he was looking at acquisitions abroad, mostly in Asia or Europe. There is no opportunity left in India. So our next acquisition will be outside, he said.

 Historically, our country has witnessed double-digit growth in the liquor segment and there is no reason why it should not continue to do so in the future. Therefore, it provides us the opportunity to grow organically. However, in developed countries, the growth rate is much smaller and acquisitions make sense in such countries, he explained.

 UB is open to the idea of buying brands as well as companies. He said there were some targets but did not elaborate. UB is the third-largest spirit maker in the world after Diageo and the Pernod Ricard-Allied Domecq combine.

 We occupy almost 5 per cent of the global market share with 65 million cases, Mallya said. Diageo sells 90 million cases annually, while Pernod Ricard?Allied Domecq sells 80 million cases.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 No one is on the tax fringe 

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, March 6: The proposed fringe benefit tax will bring all companies under its purview.

 There are almost 7,500 listed companies in the different domestic stock exchanges. Of these, 2,200 companies are loss-making, which do not pay any corporate tax. However, under the new budget proposal, all these companies would have to pay tax on fringe benefits to employees.

 Industry observers believe that the new mechanism will put these companies, already reeling under losses, into further financial pressure.

 Saurashtra Chemical chairman B. D. Bose said the new tax would be an extra burden on loss-making companies. ?If the fringe benefit tax is applied on legitimate business activities like sales promotion, campaign and travel, there will be further cash outflow leading to crisis of working capital,? Bose added.

 The fringe benefit tax will hit the pharmaceuticals and IT companies hard as travel and sales promotion are critical to their business models.

 ?It will act as a disincentive for employees in established profit-making companies, leave alone loss-making ones,? Exide Industries chairman and CEO S. B. Ganguly said.

 However, experts noted that the collection from these companies would not be much.

 ?They have limited resource deployed for items included under fringe benefits. Nevertheless, they have to shell out some amount, which was better utilised in the business,? a corporate observer said. 

 There is a general feeling among the management of loss-making companies that they would be spared from paying the fringe benefit tax.

 ?Since we do not pay any tax, how can we be charged at the corporate rate of 33.6 per cent?? a company official asked.

 Interestingly, companies with only marginal losses may come under double taxation ? fringe benefit and corporate taxes ? like profit-making companies.

 Experts feel that effecting compliance among these companies, many of which are under shady management, will be a hugely challenging task for the government.

 ?In one shot, the number of companies coming under the tax net is going up by 50 per cent. Does the government have resource to bring them under the tax net,? an expert argued.

 Companies are hoping that the finance minister may finally leave out ?legitimate business expenses? from the fringe benefit tax bracket, providing respite to both profit and loss-making companies. 

 Fringe benefits have been defined to mean any privilege, services, facility and amenity provided by an employer assessee to its employees, any reimbursement, directly or indirectly, made by the employer to the employee.

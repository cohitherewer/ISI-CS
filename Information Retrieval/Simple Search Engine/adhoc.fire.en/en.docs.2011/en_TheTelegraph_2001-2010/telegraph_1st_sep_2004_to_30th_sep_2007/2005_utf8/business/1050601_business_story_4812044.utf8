 Global giants in race for oil trophy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Big find

 New Delhi, May 31: Twenty-seven foreign companies, including global majors British Petroleum, British Gas, Petrobras of Brazil, Petronas of Malaysia and ENI of Italy, have entered the race for the 20 oil and gas exploration blocks up for grabs.

 The fifth round of bidding for exploration blocks under the new exploration licensing policy has been more successful than the earlier ones if the participation of foreign companies is a yardstick.

 The earlier rounds have attracted only a handful of small foreign companies such as Cairn Energy of the UK and Niko Resources of Canada. These have been fairly successful in striking oil and gas. They have jumped into the fray this time too. 

 The global majors have been fighting shy of entering India as the country was not considered an oil destination. However, the companies, with state-of-the-art technology, have a high probability of striking oil or gas.

 Twenty one Indian firms are also in the race, dominated by ONGC with 10 bids and Oil India with six. Downstream public sector companies such as Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum are in the running too, with upstream oil firms as their partners. In the private sector, Reliance is leading the race with 12 bids.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said seven UK companies, four Canadian firms and two from Indonesia are vying for a slice of the action. 

 The minister said bids had been received for all the blocks and the average number per block was much higher than the earlier rounds. The two Assam-Arakan blocks on offer have received three bids each. This shows the confidence in the Brahmaputra valley, the minister said. Two bids each have been received for the two Andaman and Nicobar blocks on offer.

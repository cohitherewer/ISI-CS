The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Infotech meet to focus on transition

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept 15: With the knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) wave sweeping the countrys IT-enabled services (ITES) sector, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has decided to make KPO: Moving up the value chain the theme for its flagship event, IT east 2005. 

 Business process outsourcing (BPO) deals with only automation of transaction processing, but KPO involves high-end analytical work and Indian companies are capable of moving up the value chain. We are trying to facilitate the transition from BPO to KPO, said V. V. R Babu, chairman of CIIs IT sub-committee in the eastern region.

 Shaqeel Ahmad, minister of state for communications and information technology, will be the chief guest at the two-day conference. 

 Industry leaders like Ashok Soota of MindTree Consulting, Balu Doraisamy of HP India, Raman Roy and Pradip Baijal of Trai would also attend the meet.

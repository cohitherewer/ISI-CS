 Calcutta, Dec. 11: Its not just the desi IT companies who have had an opportunity to showcase their wares in Infocom 2005, Indias biggest information, communication and technology (ICT) exposition, organised by Nasscom and Businessworld, an ABP group publication. The summit has seen a large number of participants from the neighbouring countries as well. 

 A case in point is Bangladesh. Indias eastern neighbour has been a regular participant at Infocom since 2003, with their presence increasing with every year. Infocom is the bridge between the two Banglas IT industries, said B.M. Imam Lenin, CEO, Computer Bichitra.

 Bangladeshs fledgling IT industry plans to use Infocom as a platform for networking as well as to gain in-depth knowledge about Indias IT sector. 

 The Bangladesh contingent at Infocom 2005 has been well represented, with hardware, software and communications companies making their presence felt. Insoft Ltd, BNK Communications and Revsoft Ltd are just some of the names present at the meet and theyve brought with them a wide range of products ? from digital library software to a Bengali version of MS Word, called Bijoy. The Bengal government has decided to take a look at Bijoy, and we are hoping for a positive response, said B.N. Adhikari, COO, Bangladesh Computer Samity, the ICT industry association of the country. 

 The countrys presence at Infocom has already started yielding dividends. Sops such as tax rebates and reduction of import duties have already been introduced in Bangladeshs software policies. 

 Next meet

 With Infocom 2005 drawing to a close, the date for the next years meet has also been announced today. The IT fair will be held from December 6 to December 10 in 2006.

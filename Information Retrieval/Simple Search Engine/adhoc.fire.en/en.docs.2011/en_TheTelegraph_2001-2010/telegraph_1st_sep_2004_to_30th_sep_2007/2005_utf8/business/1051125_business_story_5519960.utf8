 Cabinet seal on oil PSU stake-sale plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Rolling again

 New Delhi, Nov. 24: The cabinet committee on economic affairs today gave an in-principle approval to the petroleum ministrys proposal to allow ONGC, IOC and GAIL to offload crossholdings in each other. 

 The oil companies can offload the shares in the open market or swap back these shares with each other to raise funds. The proceeds will have to be largely invested in oil and gas exploration and production, finance minister P. Chidambaram said after the CCEA meeting.

 He said these companies would be allowed to sell the shares only in small portions on a case-to-case basis as and when required. Also, they will be allowed to swap back the shares in a ratio based on their stock prices. 

 He said the decision was taken as the companies have started competing with each other as a result of vertical integration. Also, it no longer made sense for them to cross-hold shares in each other. 

 It has been left to the individual companies to decide on the manner and timing of offloading the shares. However, the petroleum ministry, in consultation with the finance ministry, will supervise the sale.

 No time-frame has been set for the exercise, he added.

 The oil PSUs will be allowed to sell these shares only in small portions in order to avoid depressing the market price of the stocks.

 In 1999, in order to reduce its runaway fiscal deficit, the government had raised Rs 4,643 crore through the sale of the shares of these companies to each other. 

 The share prices of these companies have since shot up. For example, Indian Oils 9.61 per cent stake in ONGC alone is valued at Rs 14,000 crore. The company had paid just Rs 1,371 crore for these shares. 

 The present proposal has been introduced with some changes, like the prominence being given to swapping back of shares.

 It has been clearly emphasised that the resources will have to be used to increase the overall availability of oil and gas in the country. All these companies are engaged in oil exploration and production.

 New Delhi, July 3: The worlds fastest four-door sedan ? the Bentley Continental Flying Spur ? has hit the Indian roads.

 Sporting a price tag of Rs 1.70 crore, this premium luxury car can pick up a maximum speed of 312 km per hour. The Continental Flying Spur made its international debut at the Geneva salon in March.

 It is powered by a six-litre 552-BHP engine. The luxury car has a back-massager and comes with a spacious legroom. Over 11 hides are used to make a complete set of upholstery that is imported from northern Europe.

 The car will be available through Delhi-based Exclusive Motors, the Indian partner of Bentley Motors. However, before the year-end, Exclusive Motors will start selling the car from Mumbai as well. Orders have already been placed for six models of the Continental Flying Spur.

 In India, the Continental Flying Spurs competitors will be the Mercedes X 600L, BMW 760 IL and the Maybach.

 This is the carmakers second launch in this calendar year after it unveiled the Arnage R in February. Bentley Motors entered the Indian market nearly two years ago with the Continental GT. 

 Last two years have been exciting for our distributor. There was an overwhelming response from this (Indian) potentially growing market. The brand awareness has started catching up, Bentley Motors regional director Ian Gorsuch said at the launch today.

 Till now, Exclusive Motors has sold 12 cars from the Bentley stable. These include six each of the Arnage and the Continental GT. This years target includes selling 10 Continental Flying Spurs, six Continental GTs and three Arnages. The Arnage is available in India in two variants ? the Arnage R and RL. The more powerful Arnage T is yet to be introduced in India.

 According to Bentley Motors marketing manager (Middle East) Robin Peel, the company plans to increase its global line of production by manufacturing the Convertible Arnage as well as the Continental.

 The two-door Convertible Arnage has been showcased in the American market earlier this year where it got a huge response. While the company will manufacture Convertible Arnage in a small number, the Continental will hit the world automobile market on a larger scale by the next year-end.

 In India, however, both these variants might take long to see the light of the day. Our research shows that India does not have a great appetite for convertible cars and, therefore, it might not be a great market right now, said Peel.

 Globally, Bentley Motors sold 5,700 cars last year. However, the total production capacity of its Manchester-based Crew factory is nearly 10,000 cars annually.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Poddar caught off guard

 GARIMA SINGH

 New Delhi, Jan. 28: Saroj K. Poddar, chairman of Gillette India, today said P amp;G?s $57-billion deal to buy out Gillette of the US had ?come as a total surprise?.

 ?Honestly, I was not aware of the deal. It has come as an absolute surprise. I was abroad a couple of days back but I had no inkling about this development,? he told The Telegraph.

 Gillette of the US owns about 52 per cent of the Gillette India equity.

 Poddar said Gillette India would take at least a fortnight to assess the situation arising from the overseas deal. ?We have to see the legal issues and the obligations they pose. It is impossible to say anything right now.?

 The Gillette India chairman said he would weigh his options only after he received a proposal from P amp;G. ?A final decision will be taken in the overall best interest of shareholders,? he added.

 Poddar had formed Indian Shaving Products in 1984 along with Boston-based Gillette Company, which then held 24 per cent of the equity. Gillette raised its stake in the Indian arm to 40 per cent in 1989 and 51 per cent in 1993. 

 The company was also renamed as Gillette India. Gillette?s manufacturing plants are located in Bhiwadi, Bangalore, Mysore, Haryana and Delhi.

 Gillette India came out of the red in 2003 after a spate of restructuring that began two years ago. 

 It hived off its battery manufacturing plant at Manesar in Haryana. Aided by a cash infusion by Gillette of the US, it was able to pay off all its debts. 

 Gillette India is a Rs 407-crore firm and earned a net profit of Rs 44.8 crore in the year ended December 31, 2003. During the July-September quarter of 2004, the company reported gross sales of Rs 107.4 crore and a net profit of Rs 15.6 crore. Poddar said the company expects to report a cash profit of around Rs 120-130 crore in the year ended December 2004.

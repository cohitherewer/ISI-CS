 New Delhi, June 13: Lenovo, the Chinese major that bought the PC division of IBM earlier this year, will incorporate in its worldwide strategy a few major innovations designed at its India centre in Bangalore. 

 Many marketing campaigns and ideas that have been developed at the Bangalore centre will be incorporated in our worldwide strategy, Deepak Advani, senior vice-president and chief marketing officer of Lenovo said here today.

 The senior Lenovo official stressed the importance of India in its sales and marketing strategy.

 Advani said the PC industry in India is a strategic market for its ThinkPads and ThinkVantage technologies. The company will continue to use the IBM brand name for the next 18 months and then decide on the future course of action.

 He also dismissed any problem in the sale of Lenovo PCs and notebooks after the 18-month period. Under the contract of sale, Lenovo can continue to use the IBM brand name for five years.

 Lenovo today flew in its top executives to emphasis the continued support to the existing IBM customers and future buyers.

 Advani said, Innovation matters a lot to us. Ours is a two-pronged strategy ? first to strengthen Think brand, especially Thinkpad, leveraging the IBM brand appropriately. Second to build the Lenovo brand image.

 The development, engineering and design capabilities from IBMs PC division will become part of Lenovo over the next few months. The similarity in values, culture and heritage of the two companies has helped in the synergy, he added.

 Lenovo and IBM also renewed infrastructure initiatives for ThinkPad and its other products to reiterate the commitment to the Indian market. The company has ramped up its presence outside the metros ? Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and Chennai ?to provide customers easy access to world-class IBM service and support. 

 Ravi Marwaha, senior vice-president and the head of worldwide sales, said, India is a strategic market in Asia and we will give special importance. Revenues from Asia in the future will be highest in terms of percentage and the companys focus will be on Asia.

 Our focus for the next 18 months would be on customer satisfaction, he added.

 IBM will continue to provide its service and support to the ThinkPad and ThinkCentre products within the Lenovo-IBM alliance framework.

 Anil Philip, director, marketing and strategy, Lenovo India, said, One of the first things we are doing at Lenovo is to reach out to our entire market and ensure our customers experience superior incident resolution.

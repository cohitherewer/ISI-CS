 Crisil roots for fuel price hike

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Costly proposition 

 Mumbai, Sept. 5: Credit rating agency Crisil today called for an immediate increase of Rs 5 per litre in retail prices for petrol and Rs 4 per litre for diesel to help state-run oil companies break-even in 2005-06.

 The governments decision not to revise the prices of petro products has hit the bottomlines of these companies.

 The agency has cautioned that the profitability of PSUs rated by it, which includes HPCL, BPCL and IBP, is under severe pressure due to the rally in global crude prices and petroleum products. 

 It added that deferring a price revision would add to the quantum of increase that is already due. 

 Failing this, the government will need to look at other routes, such as reductions in excise and duties, sharing the burden with standalone refineries, and increase in prices of cooking gas (LPG) and kerosene, Crisil said. 

 Timely and adequate government action, either through retail price hike or other routes, will be the key to its ratings on these companies. 

 The agency has currently put the three companies in the high-safety category. These ratings are based on their strong position in the domestic market, financial flexibility, coupled with government ownership and support.

 The price of the Indian basket of crude has moved up from about $35 per barrel in June 2004 to almost $60 in August, a jump of 71 per cent, without a corresponding rise in end-product prices. This has put pressures on the profitability of these companies, the agency said.

 With the government controlling prices of key retail products, the retail prices of kerosene and LPG have also not been revised since March 2002 and November 2004 respectively

 This has put HPCL, BPCL and IBP in the red during the quarter ended June 30, despite substantial discounts from upstream companies like ONGC, Gail and OIL.

 If the present scenario continues, the profitability of HPCL, BPCL and IBP will remain under pressure. Consequently, their financial risk profiles will suffer, Crisil warned.

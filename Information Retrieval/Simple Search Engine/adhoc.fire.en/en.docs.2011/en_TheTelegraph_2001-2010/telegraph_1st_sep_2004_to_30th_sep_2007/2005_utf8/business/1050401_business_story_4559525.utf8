 Gap widens on higher imports 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 31: The country?s current account deficit rose to $5.47 billion during the October-December period from $4.07 billion in the preceding quarter as imports overtook exports, according to figures released by the Reserve Bank of India today.

 However, a sharp rise in foreign investment inflows resulted in a surplus in the country?s balance of payments (BoP). 

 Consequently, the BoP surplus during the reporting quarter stood at $6.54 billion compared with a deficit of $634 million in the previous quarter, the RBI figures said.

 FII inflows turned positive from August and led to a dramatic surge in the third quarter, on the back of a positive growth outlook, improved corporate performance and attractive returns, the RBI said. 

 It may be recalled that portfolio investments had touched record highs last calendar year, the RBI added. During this period, while NRI deposits continued to record outflows, the net foreign direct investment improved marginally.

 The central bank also released the data on sources of accretion to foreign exchange reserves during the April to December period. According to RBI, foreign exchange reserves showed a lower growth at $18.2 billion in the reporting period compared with a rise of $27.1 billion in the corresponding previous period.

 The Reserve Bank added that major sources of accretion to foreign exchanges reserves during the nine-month period were foreign investment, external commercial borrowings and external assistance, short-term credit among others. 

 These accretions to the reserves were partly counterbalanced by a current account deficit of $7.4 billion and net outflows under NRI deposits at $1.3 billion.

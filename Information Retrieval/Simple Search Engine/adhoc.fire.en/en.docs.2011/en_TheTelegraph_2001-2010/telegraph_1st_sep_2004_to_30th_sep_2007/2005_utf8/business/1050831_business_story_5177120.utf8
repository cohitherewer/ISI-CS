 Rangarajan for higher deposit rates

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: Banks need to raise deposit rates, said C. Rangarajan, chairman of the economic advisory council to the Prime Minister. 

 We have to pay attention to the rate of interests offered on deposits. For most maturities, the real rate of interest is not positive. This needs a correction with some upward adjustment, he said while speaking at the banking symposium jointly organised by Assocham and Indian Institute of Foreign Trade (IIFT).

 The former RBI governor said there is a fractured structure of interest rates with respect to mobilisation of resources, which should be reviewed.

 Talking about the escalating crude prices, he said there is a need to revise oil prices and added that the finance ministry is sticking to the RBIs forecast of 5-5.5 per cent rate of inflation for this fiscal.

 Chief economic advisor Ashok Lahiri also expressed concern over the surge in global oil prices. 

 He said the finance ministry is closely monitoring the situation. Global crude prices crossing $70 a barrel is not a matter of joy. Lets watch it.

 He declined to comment on the impact of global oil prices on the rate of inflation that fell to a three-year low at 3.13 per cent during the week ended August 13.

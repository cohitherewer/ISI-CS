 SKP goes on retail overdrive

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 30: The city-based brokerage firm, SKP Securities Limited, has unveiled a retail distribution channel for financial products and services. Called Moneywise, the new branded channel will cater to the retail investors in the eastern region.

 Within the next financial year, we will expand the retail distribution network to cover the entire eastern region, said Naresh Pachisia, promoter and managing director, SKP Securities . 

 The Moneywise brand has been introduced to increase customers awareness and interest in financial investments and over time, we will use the brands recall value to launch various products and services, he added.

 The new retailing network will be supported by the companys own branches as well as its franchisee outlets. SKP has 20 outlets, 35 channel partners and over 700 direct selling agents in the region. 

 But what prompted SKP to launch a new retail channel? Pachisia mentioned that with the increase in the savings rate in the country, a major part of it has moved into physical assets like real estate and gold while investments in capital market instruments, which provide the maximum returns, have remained fixed at about two per cent. This demonstrates the lack of knowledge and awareness amongst the common man of the country about prudent investments. It is the responsibility of financial advisors like us to educate the mass and make them aware about the importance of proper financial planning and wealth creation strategies, explained Pachisia.

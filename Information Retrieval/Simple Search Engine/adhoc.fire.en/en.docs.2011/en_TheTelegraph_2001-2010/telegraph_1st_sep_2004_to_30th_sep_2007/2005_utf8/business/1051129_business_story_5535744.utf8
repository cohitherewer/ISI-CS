 Govt sold on bank merger

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 28: The government today emphasised the need for consolidating the banking sector to enable banks to reap the benefits of size and scale.

 There is a tremendous need for consolidation in both public and private sector banks. Apart from giving economies of scale, they would be in a better position to absorb risks, economic affairs secretary Ashok Jha said at the India Economic Summit organised by the CII and World Economic Forum.

 He, however, made it clear that the consolidation process will have to be initiated by the industry and not driven by the government. The government will bless the marriage of banks, but will not find the suitor, he added.

 The countrys largest bank ? State Bank of India ? is ranked 83rd in the world.

 Reiterating the need for banks to raise capital worth $12 billion over the next five years, Jha said sustained growth in GDP mandates a significant increase in bank credit especially to small and medium enterprises and agriculture sectors as they provide bulk of the employment.

 Agriculture credit has clocked a 56 per cent growth in the first half of the current fiscal. He said the government would address the financial crises dogging the co-operative banks. 

 The Vaidyanathan committee, which examined all aspects of the ailing co-operative banks in the country, had recommended a Rs 15,000-crore bailout package.

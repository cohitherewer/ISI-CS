 Bengal to size up Basell benefits for Haldia Petro

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Chatterjee: Let?s 

 go 

 Calcutta, Feb. 8: Haldia Petrochemicals Limited (HPL) will require the Bengal government?s permission to invest in Dutch petrochemical company Basell Polyolefins.

 Purnendu Chatterjee?s The Chatterjee Group is keen that HPL joins a consortium of investors he is leading in bidding for Basell. However, he has been asked to explain how HPL stands to gain if it puts money in the venture.

 Chatterjee, along with the state government, is one of the principal promoters of the Rs 5170-crore HPL, which has an equity of Rs 1,416 crore and debts of Rs 3,100 crore.

 Bengal commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen confirmed that Purnendu spoke to him about getting HPL on board the consortium bidding for the Dutch petrochem company. ?I have told him that the government must know how the company will benefit. HPL is expected to make a presentation to us soon. ?

 Sen: Playing save

 Purnendu has teamed up with ICICI Ventures, the country?s largest equity fund, and a clutch of US investors to table a bid of more than ?4 billion for Basell.

 The Haldia Petrochem board, too, has discussed the investment but an approval is needed before it can go ahead. 

 Sources say the lenders have been sounded out on plans to own a slice of Basell. ?They are positive about investing in the overseas firm,? company officials said. 

 The race for Basell started in July. Several foreign private equity funds and state-owned petrochemical companies have since queued up in hopes of winning it over.

 Three bidders have qualified for the third round of bidding. They are the consortium led by Purnendu, National Petrochemicals of Iran and INEOS. Sources said the suitors will now carry out a due diligence, expected to be completed next month. Final bids are due in April.

 The sources said a team from HPL will soon visit Basell?s plant to see if there is synergy between the two firms. Basell, with a turnover of ?5.7 billion, has been valued at ?4.4-4.5 billion. 

 With 6,700 on its rolls world wide, the company is believed to be a pioneer in polyolefin technology. It is the world?s largest polypropy-lene firm and Europe?s leading polyethylene maker. HPL, too, manufactures ethylene and polypropylene.

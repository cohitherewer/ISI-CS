 Key meet on budget support

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 15: Finance minister P. Chidambaram held a meeting with Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia to thrash out the issue of gross budgetary support for plan expenditure in the coming budget. 

 Ahluwalias proposal to spend part of the burgeoning foreign exchange reserves on infrastructure development was also discussed. 

 ?We had a very successful meeting. It was part of the budget discussions. Both gross budgetary support and utilisation of forex reserves for infrastructure were discussed, quot; Ahluwalia said after the two-hour long meeting.

 The plan panel had sought a gross budgetary support of Rs 1,95,000 crore, but indications are that it may get about Rs 1,76,000 crore. Last year, the amount was put at Rs 1,45,000 crore.

 The panel says it needs more money as the government will have to spend on social sector commitments made in the common minimum programme, which would require Rs 33,000 crore.

 The Prime Minister?s committee on infrastructure has drawn up a Rs 1,70,000-crore development plan for roads over the next seven years and another modernisation and upgradation plan for airports, which would require an investment of Rs 40,000 crore.

 Ahluwalia refused to give details of his discussions with Chidambaram, but hinted that some way may be found to use foreign exchange for infrastructure development. 

 North Block is in a quandary as it cannot totally reject Ahluwalias idea as the plan has been welcomed by President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.

 There is, however, a move to float a counter proposal of a fund that would garner investible resources in hard currency for infrastructure development. Investments in such a fund could be quasi-equity.

 The idea of using the countrys $130-billion forex reserves is considered inflationary and ?financially imprudent? as the money does not belong to the government at all. 

 ?The money with the RBI does not belong to the government, and from the monetary point of view, its rupee value has already been issued in the country. If we were to use the same foreign exchange again for any purpose within the geographic boundaries of the country we would have to print more money? this tantamounts to devaluing our currency and creating an inflationary situation,? top finance ministry officials said.

 Foreign exchange earned by people working abroad or firms exporting goods and services is deposited with banks here who pass it on to the Reserve Bank of India.

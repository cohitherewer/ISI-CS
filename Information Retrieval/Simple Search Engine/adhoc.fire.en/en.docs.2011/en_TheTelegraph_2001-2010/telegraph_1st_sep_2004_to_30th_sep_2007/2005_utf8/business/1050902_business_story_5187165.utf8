 Tug-of-war over fuel price hike

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Sept. 1: The finance ministry has shot down petroleum ministrys twin proposals of higher subsidy on kerosene and cooking gas and lower corporate tax on state-run oil refining and marketing companies.

 The petroleum ministry has prepared a note incorporating the twin proposals, which is expected to be taken up by the Union cabinet next week.

 The finance ministry is also against a proposal to float kerosene bonds to help bridge the gap between subsidies paid out for cooking gas and kerosene and the actual difference between selling and buying price of these two fuels. 

 North Block mandarins have argued that increasing subsidies is impossible as the government is now bound by ceilings on fiscal and revenue deficits set by the new laws on fiscal responsibility. 

 Tax concession to state-run oil companies is also out of question as they have been paying far lower amounts as advance tax. The government has collected nearly Rs 2,000 crore less from oil marketing and refining PSUs as advance tax this year. 

 It has opposed the bond concept floated by the petroleum ministry, arguing that the fiscal responsibility act has set limits on state borrowing and as these bonds will be sovereign debts their floatation will mean going beyond promised ceilings. 

 Finance ministry officials also said the bond proposal was flawed as it was merely a paper transaction deal which would merely postpone the pay-out burden of the oil companies without any real money coming in to help them out. 

 The finance ministry argues that the only way out is to go in for a steep oil price hike. However as this is politically unpalatable, the government is likely to opt for a compromise ? increase prices somewhat while asking state-owned oil firms to absorb some of the losses.

 Natco moves to stall Novartis drug patent

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 20: The Hyderabad-based Natco Pharma has opposed Novartis Indias move to get its anti-cancer drug (Imatinib Mesylate) patented. Novartis has filed an application with the controller of patents, seeking a grant of patents for the drug.

 Natco Pharma, which makes a generic version of the drug, has contended that there is lack of novelty and inventive steps in the application made by Novartis and therefore the patent should not be granted to Novartis.

 It has also expressed that Novartis application squarely falls within the concept of evergreening as the polymoph (minerals having identical compositions but different crystal structures) claimed is the same as that of the molecule, thus, resulting in no merit for the grant of a patent. 

 It may be recalled that Natco had earlier challenged the decision of the Controller-General of Patents and Trademarks to grant exclusive marketing rights (EMR) to Novartis for the same anti-cancer drug called Glivec. The EMR, a temporary provision, was given for five years or until a product patent supersedes the rights in the country. 

 Natco had then argued that under the provisions of the Indian Patent Act, exclusive rights can be granted only in respect of patents and applications filed in a convention country after January 1, 1995.

 While Natco officials did not comment citing the matter was sub-judice, the company in a communication issued to the stock exchanges today said that the invention of the drug in question was made in 1993, and the Indian patent application merely claims a Beta version of the same substance, and hence would not deserve consideration.

 Here, the company quoted the Indian Patents Act which has excluded grant of patents to salts, ethers, polymorphs, and similar combinations of known substance unless they differ significantly in properties with regards to efficacy.

 Natco added that it has also relied on extensive tests, including bio-equivalence (the scientific basis on which generic and branded drugs are compared) to show that the crystal structures of Imatinib have equal efficacy.

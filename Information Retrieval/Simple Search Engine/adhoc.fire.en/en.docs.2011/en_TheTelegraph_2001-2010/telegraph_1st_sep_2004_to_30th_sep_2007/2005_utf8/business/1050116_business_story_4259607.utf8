 New Delhi, Jan. 15: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will announce a new pricing policy for petrol and diesel soon as the old system of fortnightly reviews has not been successful, petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said today.

 Aiyar said the government had no plans to change the prices of petroleum products at the moment. This is the fourth fortnight in a row when prices have not been changed. 

 The government has veered round to the view that fortnightly price changes lead to instability and uncertainty in the market.

 Petrol prices were last revised on November 15, 2004 when they were lowered by Rs 1.16 per litre, while diesel prices were changed on October 31 last year. 

 The minister was speaking to reporters after inaugurating the first energy seminar on Indo-Russian hydrocarbon co-operation.

 Meanwhile, the Petrotech 2005 international conference will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow. 

 Delegates from more than 20 countries, representing leading oil and gas majors, will be attending the conference.

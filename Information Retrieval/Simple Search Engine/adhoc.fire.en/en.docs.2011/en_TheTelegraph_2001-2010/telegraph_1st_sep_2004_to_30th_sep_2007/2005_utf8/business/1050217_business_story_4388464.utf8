 Henkel Spic on the prowl

 SAMBIT SAHA AND CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Calcutta, Feb. 16: Henkel Spic India is contemplating acquisitions in the north and west to consolidate its national presence.

 The company, with brands like Henkel, Mr White, Margo and Fa, has its manufacturing bases in Calcutta and Chennai. Managing director A. Satish Kumar said the company was looking at buyouts in the cosmetic, laundry and home-care segments. ?It could either be a brand or company, depending on how it fits into our existing portfolio,? Kumar added.

 The east and south have been traditional strongholds of the company owing to the proximity of its manufacturing units. It bought Calcutta Chemicals from Shaw Wallace a few years ago, which had given it access to the Margo brand.

 The company, a subsidiary of German major Henkel KgaA, is restructuring its entire Indian operations. ?Once the restructuring is completed, we will look into possible acquisitions,? Kumar said, adding that the entire process could be over within the next three months.

 Henkel Spic India Ltd is undergoing a reverse merger with Calcutta Chemicals, which has now been renamed as Henkel India. The merged entity will be called Henkel India Ltd, which will be a pure manufacturing company. The marketing and distribution operations will be divested to Henkel Marketing India Ltd.

 Madras High Court has directed an EGM of Henkel Spic India on March 10 for the merger. The proceedings of the EGM would be put before the court. The company expects the entire process to be completed in another three months following the EGM.

 Kumar said the marketing and the manufacturing companies could be merged once again in the future.

 The development comes at a time when the FMCG market is showing volume growth after a few years. During the financial year 2004, the company recorded a turnover of Rs 403 crore. It is expecting a turnover of Rs 500 crore this fiscal. If the company manages an acquisition, the topline growth could be even higher.

 However, the pressure on margin is expected to continue with the raw material cost of linear alkyl benzene (LAB), which is a major component in manufacturing detergents, escalating. Its prices have been shooting up for the last three-four months due to global shortage of benzene (main ingredient of LAB).

 Moreover, the packaging cost has also gone up sharply. Kumar said the company might have to partly absorb the rise in input costs. 

 Detergent provides 60 per cent of the company?s turnover. 

 However, soap gives better margin. Sales of Margo, the neem-based soap, went up 12 per cent last year. The company added a fresh capacity of 6,000 tonnes per year at its Calcutta facility last November.

 New Delhi, May 26: General Electric, the US conglomerate, is gung-ho on acquisitions and investments in India. It also plans to make India a manufacturing hub.

 We are looking at acquisitions in India. This is the right time to invest here. We have to be as bold on the market as on the cost size, said GE chairman Jeffrey R. Immelt at the CEOs forum organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) here today.

 Anytime we have invested in India, we made money. But whenever we made investments in markets, we made losses, he said, indicating that GE was planning to make huge investments in the country.

 Expressing confidence that the present government will ensure a stable environment, Immelt said, We want to invest more here and expect great benefits for GE.

 Sharing GEs plans for India, he said the company was targeting an 8 per cent organic growth and expected India to be a major contributor towards this.

 Stating that the company would continue to be a major player in the energy sector, Immelt sought speedy resolution of the Dabhol imbroglio so that the company could move on with its work in the country.

 He said GE was ready to work with the government and other companies to resolve the tangle.

 GE, along with Bechtel, owns 85 per cent of the beleaguered Dabhol Power Company. The company has expressed its interest to restart the 2,184-MW power plant.

 We are ready to work in partnership with the government or any other Indian company, he said.

 According to the revival strategy, Indian lenders will buy out the offshore debt of foreign lenders in Dabhol and also settle the claims of GE and Bechtel. 

 After the settlement of claims, state-run National Thermal Power Corporation and Gail (India) Ltd will run the power plant and the LNG terminal respectively. 

 Indian lenders to the $3-billion project have reportedly reached an agreement with GE and Bechtel to settle their claims for $305 million.

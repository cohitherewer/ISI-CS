 De Beers arm polishes plan to boost sales

 Solitaire dream

 Mumbai, Oct. 9: The Diamond Trading Company (DTC) ? an affiliate of De Beers ? is pulling out all stops to increase diamonds sales in India, West Asia and the US.

 The sales and marketing arm of the De Beers group is the worlds largest supplier of rough diamonds. DTC handles approximately half of the worlds supply by value. With the threat of synthetic diamonds looming large, DTC is determined to nip it in the bud. Synthetic diamonds boast the same hardness and sparkle that natural ones possesses. 

 However, DTC officials do not want to admit that synthetic diamonds are a threat. Its not an issue yet. If it does become one, we are ready for it, regional marketing director Nicholas Graham Smith said. The diamond industry thinks otherwise.

 DTC has asked synthetic diamonds to brand themselves as something else, just as Champagne made outside the district of Champagne in France is called sparkling wine. Disclosures should be clear and precise, said Graham Smith.

 Ironically, De Beers is the largest supplier of synthetic diamonds for industrial use.

 The battle they have waged against competing luxury brands is more real and threatening, although DTC officials said they have managed to corner a market share over the years from luxury brands. 

 DTC has managed to ward off competition from luxury brands like Prada, Gucci and Cartier. In 1999, the percentage of sales compared with luxury brands was around 3.6 per cent and this has risen appreciably to 8.5 per cent in 2004, Smith said.

 The De Beers group is also opening up to adopt a friendlier and more transparent persona in its deals and aggressively driving sales across global markets. DTC is also expanding its network by increasing the number of sight holders and unleashing marketing campaigns in India for the festival and marriage seasons. In West Asia, DTC has already worked out a campaign for the Ramadan season, while in the US, it will unleashed a marketing blitzkrieg ahead of Christmas.

 At the auctions in July, DTC appointed 93 sight holders compared with 83 a couple of years ago. The closely held cabal of sight holders is thus expanding.

 Highway man crosses new milestone 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Feb. 28: Finance minister P. Chidambaram 

has rolled out a Rs 10,000-crore special purpose vehicle (SPV) to finance road, 

port, tourism and airport projects and raised cess on petrol and diesel for highway 

development.

 The cess on petrol and diesel has been raised to Rs 

2 per litre from the existing Rs 1.50 per litre to fund the national highway development 

projects (NHDP). Chidambaram has allocated Rs 1,400 crore during 2005-06 to four 

lane 4000 kilometres and a special package for North Eastern region with an allocation 

of Rs 450 crore.

Chidambaram said, ?There are many infrastructure projects 

that are financially viable but, in this situation, face difficulties in raising 

resources. I propose that such projects may be funded through a financial SPV. quot;

 The projects would be appraised by an inter-institutional group of banks and financial institutions. The SPV will lend funds, especially debt of longer term maturity, directly to eligible projects to supplement other loans from banks and financial institutions. Government will communicate the borrowing limit to the SPV at the beginning of every financial year.

 The budget also made a provision of Rs 1500 crore for quot;viability gap quot; funding for infrastructure projects. That mechanism would be used in conjunction with the funding mechanism through the SPV.

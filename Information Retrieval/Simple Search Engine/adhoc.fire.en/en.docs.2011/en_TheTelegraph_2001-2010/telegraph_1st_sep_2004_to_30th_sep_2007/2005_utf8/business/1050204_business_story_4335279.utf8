 Balrampur Chini to take preferential route

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Calcutta, Feb. 3: Balrampur Chini Mills Limited will issue fresh equity on a preferential basis to finance its Rs 400-crore investment over the next two years.

 A board meeting on February 5 will discuss the preferential allotment and a stock split, the company has informed the stock exchanges. 

 Sources said Balrampur Chini plans to invest another Rs 200 crore in its second greenfield project likely to be set up in eastern Uttar Pradesh with a capacity of 7000 tonnes crushed per day (TCD).

 The company had recently announced a Rs 200-crore expansion programme for its first 7,000-TCD sugar plant at Akbarpur in Uttar Pradesh. It will also expand the capacity by 4,000 TCD in three of its existing mills at Tulsipur, Babhnan and Haidergarh.

 ?The total investment over the next two years will be Rs 400 crore and we plan to raise proportionate amount from the preferential allotment,? the official said. 

 Balrampur Chini is negotiating with various Indian as well as foreign institutions to participate in the issue and will also consider the foreign direct investment (FDI) route.

 The second factory will have a 20-MW power generation and 80-KLPD industrial alcohol distillery facility and is expected to be operational in November 2006.

 With the completion of the expansion programme, the total capacity of Balrampur Chini will increase from 29,000 TCD to 47,000 TCD, while that of the distillery will increase from 160 KLPD to 240 KLPD and co-generation from 47.8 MW to 67.8 MW.

 This will make it the largest sugar producer in India, surpassing the four sugar companies of the KK Birla group, which together add up to approximately 36,000 TCD.

 The current capacity of the Tulsipur unit is 6,000 TCD, while that of the Bhabnan unit is 8,000 TCD. The capacity of the Balrampur unit is 10,000 TCD and that of the Haidergarh unit, which is an integrated sugar complex, is 5,000 TCD.

 The share price of Balrampur Chini Mills touched its 52-week high today at Rs 693.95 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on the back of the reports on stock split and preferential allotment. The share closed at Rs 664.30, up 3.54 per cent from yesterday?s Rs 641.60.

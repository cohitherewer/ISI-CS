 Wipro buys out Austrian company

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 19: Wipro Ltd will acquire the Austria-based NewLogic in an all-cash deal worth $56 million.

 Wipro Technologies, the global IT services arm of Wipro, has signed an agreement to pick up a 100 per cent stake in NewLogic. Wipro has paid 21 million euro upfront and the remaining 26 million euro would be paid over a three-year period on achieving targeted financial conditions.

 NewLogic is a leading semiconductor design services company with intellectual property rights to complex wireless applications like wireless LAN and Bluetooth. The company also has strong analog and radio frequency design capabilities.

 Wipro said the capabilities of NewLogic will complement its own portfolio of patents in wireless and wireline technologies and the acquisition will position the combined entity as a global leader.

 After the acquisition, Wipro will gain 120 specialists and access to 25 patent filings and over 20 customers in the product engineering domain. These customers include Agere, Infineon and Philips. 

 Wipro is a leading solutions provider in semiconductor design services with more than 1200 design engineers. The acquisition further strengthens this position in the global design services market. Europe contributes to 9 per cent of Wipros revenues for R amp;D services in embedded products, a company statement said.

 In product engineering, ownership of intellectual properties is a key asset for building services revenues. The NewLogic acquisition is a significant step in Wipros plans to be the leader in the wireless IP and radio frequency technology space, Wipro Technologies product engineering solutions president Ramesh Emani said.

 The acquisition would provide Wipro a solid base for addressing the large market in Continental Europe, he added.

 This is a synergistic partnership where our clients will benefit from Wipros broad suite of capabilities and global services delivery. We are excited about offering NewLogics services to Wipros customer base. Wireless patent is a hot area and we are confident that the new combined entity is well positioned to be the number one in this space, NewLogic CEO Hans-Peter Metzler said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Well on the way to Top 10 

 Is India?s GDP growth now on a permanently high plateau? The second quarter?s GDP growth rate, at 8 per cent, has been marginally below the 8.1 per cent notched up during the first quarter. The Prime Minister has set his sights on a 10 per cent growth. Average GDP growth in the second quarter of the last three years has been 7.8 per cent, well above the 5.9 per cent average of the second quarter growth in the preceding three years (2000-01 to 2002-03), or even the 6.7 per cent of the 1997-98 to 1999-00 period.

 But this is not the first time that we?ve had high GDP growth ? in the mid-nineties, from 1994-97, the economy grew at an average rate of 7.5 per cent. If the GDP grows by 7.5 per cent this year, the average for 2003-06 would be 7.6 per cent. Manufacturing and trade, hotels, transport and communications are the sectors that have shown the highest growth-? manufacturing growth in the first half of this year has been 10.2 per cent, while growth in trade and hotels have been 12.2 per cent. But it?s worth remembering that manufacturing growth was 11.9 per cent in 1994-95 and 14.9 per cent in 1995-96, while the trade, hotels, transport and communications sectors grew by 10.4 per cent and 13.3 per cent respectively. In short, it?s a bit early to say whether the improvement is cyclical or structural.

 Among the sectors where growth has slowed down are mining and electricity, gas and water supply. Unless these infrastructure industries do better, they could decelerate overall growth.

 However, the difference between the mid-nineties and now is that Indian industry has become far more competitive. That?s seen from the fact that merchandise exports as a percentage of GDP was an average of 9.5 per cent during 1994-95 to 1996-97,while it was as high as 12.8 per cent last year, and 13.1 per cent in the first quarter of this year. And, of course, we now have IT services and the BPO industry. In short, export demand is becoming a major contributor to GDP growth.

 ICICI Bank 

 Its d?j? vu for investors in ICICI Bank. In 2004, the bank had raised Rs 3500 crore at Rs 280 per share. At that time, too, equity dilution was large, at around 20 per cent. Also, Tier-1 capital was 7.2 per cent at the end of December 2003, shortly before the management announced that they would need further capital.

 Those who invested in that issue did very well, with the stock at around Rs 540 currently. It took ICICI Bank just four quarters to bring its quarterly earnings per share back to what it had been before the dilution. EPS was Rs 7.31 for the March 2004 quarter, before the issue, and it was Rs 8.28 for the March 2005 quarter.

 This time, the dilution is slightly less, and Tier-1 capital was again at 7.2 per cent at the end of September. True, valuations are higher and the stock has shot up in tandem with the overall market. But net profit growth has been 27 per cent (year-on-year) in the first half, well above the equity dilution, which means that the issue will not dilute earnings. Besides, the bank is numero uno in retail, and its insurance and asset management subsidiaries are private sector market leaders. Throw in its proven capability in executing its volume growth-led strategy, and the issue should have no difficulty sailing through, on the premise that investing in the bank is an investment in the India story.

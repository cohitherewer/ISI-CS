 MCX keen on tie-ups 

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Calcutta, March 20: The Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) is open to tie-ups with regional commodity exchanges.

 ?We have expressed our interest to the regional commodity exchanges to forge tie-ups. Now, it is for them to decide whether to take up our offer or not,? MCX chief executive officer Anjani Sinha said.

 The exchange has recently signed a deal with the India Pepper and Spice Trade Association (IPSTA), Cochin. The Kanpur Commodity Exchange also trades in commodity futures using the MCX platform, said Sinha.

 ?Although tying up with regional exchanges will help boost the volumes on our exchange, it is not the only driving force for our venture. We want to establish credibility in the commodity market and safeguard it from any irregularities,? added Sinha.

 He said regional exchanges are more conversant with trading in specific commodities and such knowledge will be beneficial for multi-commodity exchanges. 

 ?IPSTA is the only exchange that trades in black pepper and thus has the best knowledge about the commodity,? said Sinha.

 Similarly, Sinha cited the examples of the Ahmedabad Commodity Exchange for its trading in castor and the Bombay Oilseeds and Oil Exchange for oil and oilseeds.

 The MCX also plans to introduce almond and cloves future on the exchange shortly and has no plans to launch futures for base metals such as copper and aluminium.

 ?In India, the demand for agri-based commodity futures is more than base metals and therefore, we plan to launch more agri-based commodity futures,? said Sinha.

 The Forwards Market Commission, the regulatory body for the commodities market, is formulating necessary steps to boost the domestic market, he added.

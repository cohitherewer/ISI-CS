 Refco rushes for bankruptcy shield 

 JENNY ANDERSON 

 New York, Oct. 18: Refco, 

 the brokerage firm that has been unraveling over the last 

 week, said on Monday that it had filed for bankruptcy protection 

 on Tuesday.

 At the same time, an investor 

 group led by J. Christopher Flowers, a former Goldman Sachs 

 partner who owns a private investment company, signed an 

 agreement to buy the firms futures brokerage business 

 ? the only unitin Refco stable remaining that is not in 

 the process of being shuttered. 

 The proposed price was $768 million, 

 the statement said. The tentative deal gives Refco the option 

 to retain up to 20 per cent of the equity value of the entities 

 being sold. 

 By putting the unit in bankruptcy, 

 Refco is seeking to limit the buyers potential exposure 

 to the raft of litigation.

 On October 10, Refco announced 

 that its chief executive, Phillip R. Bennett, was put on 

 indefinite leave as he had hidden a $430-million debt owed 

 to Refco by a company that he controlled. 

 That debt, which was shifted to 

 a hedge fund, called Liberty Corner Capital, was not disclosed 

 or associated with Bennett in the companys initial 

 public offering in August. 

 Refco also said that its financial 

 statements as far back as 2002 could not be relied upon. 

 Shares of Refco plunged more than 

 70 per cent after the announcement. 

 On Thursday, the New York Stock 

 Exchange halted trading in the stock, while the companys 

 bonds continued to plummet. By the end of the week, Refco 

 had shut its business operations. Those businesses have 

 been closing out trades.

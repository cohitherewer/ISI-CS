 CSFB sheds First Boston tag

 Geneva, June 29 (Reuters): Credit Suisse moved to a single-brand marketing strategy on Wednesday, pulling the plug on the venerable First Boston name for its investment bank, the Swiss-based financial conglomerate said.

 The company said it will use the Credit Suisse name on all activities in private, corporate and investment banking, and asset management. 

 The move will not result in a goodwill write-down but will result in some administrative costs, a spokesman said. 

 The corporate facelift follows Credit Suisses OneBank strategy unveiled in December, designed to better integrate the companys disparate business divisions. 

 Investors have cheered chief executive Oswald Gruebel for restructuring efforts by pushing the firms share price up over 10 per cent so far this year.

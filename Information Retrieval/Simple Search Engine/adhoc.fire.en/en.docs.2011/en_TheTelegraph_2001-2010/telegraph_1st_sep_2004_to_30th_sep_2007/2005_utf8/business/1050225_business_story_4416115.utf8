 Srei plans to raise Rs 300 cr

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Calcutta, Feb. 24: Srei Infrastructure Finance Limited plans to raise around Rs 300 crore either from the domestic or international market.

 The company will hold an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) on March 10 to pass a special resolution, which would allow it to raise up to Rs 5,000 crore in one or more tranches.

 However, sources said in the first tranche, the company plans to raise close to Rs 300 crore. Such a move will enable the company to raise Rs 5,000 crore in the future without seeking shareholders? approval.

 The validity of such a resolution continues unless it is annulled in a meeting by the shareholders, sources said.

 After the EGM, the board will decide on the best way to raise capital and would appoint investment bankers to initiate the process of such an issue.

 Capital market conditions at the time of the issue will determine whether the company will first tap the market at home or abroad and also the ratio of capital to be raised from such markets, sources said. The issue should hit the market in a couple of months.

 The company will raise the additional equity in the domestic market through public issue or by the way of a private placement or preferential allotment. It will also consider the options of issuing preference shares or bonds or convertible securities within the country and through American depository receipts (ADR) or global depository receipts (GDR) in the international market.

 According to the EGM notice, the company has initiated various measures to increase long-term capital to drive business growth. Additionally, Srei wants to attract both domestic and international investors and create adequate liquidity in the market for its shares.

 Such an issue, according to the notice, will also give the company a visibility in the market, which would facilitate its expansion plans and future business.

 Srei also plans to raise its foreign investment limit from the current 49 per cent to 74 per cent of the share capital of the company.

 The total foreign shareholding in the company was 17.27 per cent as on December 31, 2004.

 Golden jubilee gift in sight as LIC goes on cover drive

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Shukla: Reason to cheer

 New Delhi, Aug 22: Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) is weighing the option of coming out with a golden jubilee bonus as it enters its 50th year of operations.

 LICs actuaries are now calculating the insurers distributable surplus and the results will be known by the end of the month.

 The state-owned life insurer ? the largest in the country with a policyholder base of over 160 million ? will consider the special bonus option if that number is healthy.

 Yes, our policyholders are demanding a special bonus. LICs valuations will be complete only by the end of this month. It is being worked out by actuaries. We may decide something... but unless we know how much the surplus is, no decision can be taken, said LIC chairman A.K. Shukla. 

 LIC ? which was formed in September 1956 ? will be giving a special bonus for the first time in its history if it indeed decides to do so.

 Under the provisions of the LIC Act, if the insurance company declares a surplus, 95 per cent of it has to be distributed amongst policyholders, while 5 per cent goes to the government. The corporation will complete its 50 years of existence in 2006. 

 However, LIC will launch its year-long celebrations beginning next month.To begin with, the countrys largest insurer has decided to launch a golden jubilee policy for masses. 

 We have requested the Prime Minister to launch the scheme, but have yet to receive a confirmation.

 Shukla declined to give details about the policy since it hasnt been cleared by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).

 Asked whether the new policy would charge a low premium to make it more affordable, he said, We will follow an appropriate premium structure.

 Meanwhile, the insurance company is waiting for approvals from both the government and the IRDA before launching a micro-insurance scheme for the poor.

 The micro-insurance product is likely to offer not only life cover but also insure property, livestock and farm equipment. In order to design this product, LIC is planning to tie up with few general insurance companies.

 LIC, which has assets worth over Rs 4,00,000 crore, is aiming to cross the magical Rs 1,00,000-crore-mark in total premium income this fiscal, a growth of 30 per cent over last fiscals Rs 75,000 crore.

 Reversing the trend of falling growth in premium income, LIC is expecting 50 per cent growth in premium from new business at over Rs 18,000 crore this fiscal. 

 Our market share is about 75 per cent in terms of new premium income but in terms of number of policies sold, it was still about 90 per cent, Shukla said.

 To attain the ambitious target, the insurer plans to come up with a slew of new schemes including a unit-linked whole-life insurance plan called Jeevan Plus and two to three variants of traditional products.

 Ulips contributed to 42 per cent of LICs new business last fiscal. It expects to maintain that record this year as well.

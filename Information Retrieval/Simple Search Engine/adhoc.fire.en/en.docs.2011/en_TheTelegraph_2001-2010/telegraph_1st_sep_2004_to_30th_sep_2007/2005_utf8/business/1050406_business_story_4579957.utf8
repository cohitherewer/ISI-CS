 Boeing chief vows to beat Airbus

 Seattle, April 5 (Reuters): Boeing Co will reclaim its global leadership over European rival Airbus this year, the new head of commercial aircraft sales for the No. 1 US aerospace group predicted on Monday.

 ?We?ll beat them this year,? said Scott Carson in his first appearance before the media since being appointed in December to reinvigorate marketing at the United States? top export firm.

 The last year Boeing won more orders than Airbus was 2000, but in the first quarter of this year, the US firm has won some major orders, including recent multibillion dollar deals with low-cost Irish carrier Ryanair and leading Chinese airlines.

 Carson vowed to keep up the pressure throughout the year on Airbus, whose aggressive push to expand its product range with a diverse family of jets, including the A380 superjumbo, has at times caught Boeing flat-footed.

 Airbus overtook Boeing by aircraft deliveries in 2003, and repeated the feat in 2004. By orders, Airbus has outsold Boeing every year since 2001.

 ?We will reverse market share on orders very quickly, I?m confident of that,? Carson said.

 In 2004, when Airbus won 366 orders against Boeing?s 272, the Chicago-based aerospace and defence group was particularly embarrassed, falling way short of its publicly heralded target for winning 200 orders for its latest airliner, the super-efficient 787.

 Carson said disclosing any kind of order target for the plane had been a mistake since some airlines held off on orders because they thought the pressure to reach the sales goal would prompt Boeing to offer them a better deal.

 He said the 787, which Boeing is betting will eventually become its best-selling wide-body jet, outpacing the 777, ?is doing incredibly well in the market.?

 And he insisted Airbuss A350, the European aircraft manufacturers competitor for 787 ? whose emergence as a rival some analysts have blamed for Boeing?s missing last years target ? was a ?non factor?.

 Hindalco quarterly net dips

 OUR BUREAU

 Oct. 29: Hindalco Industries Ltd has registered a decline in second-quarter earnings for the current financial year. The net profit of the non-ferrous metals producer has declined 7 per cent to Rs 276.5 crore compared with Rs 298 crore clocked in the same period last year.

 The earnings of the company eroded despite a surge in total income to Rs 2753.5 crore during the quarter from Rs 2562.4 crore in the year-ago period.

 However, the net profit of the AV Birla group flagship rose to Rs 601.4 crore for the six months ended September 30 from Rs 533.6 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.

 Giving an outlook, Hindalco said global demand growth forecasts for aluminium remained unchanged at 4-5 per cent for 2005-06, with specific end-uses across various regions expected to drive this growth. ?Civil reconstruction works in the US in the aftermath of the recent hurricane havoc are expected to bring a one-time boost in demand for aluminium products,? the company said in a statement. ?Alumina production losses and the resulting supply shortages are also adding pressure on the global aluminium market. We anticipate primary metal prices to be volatile in the near term ? perhaps move within a range of $1,800-$1,950 over the medium term depending on the supply situation,? it added.

 Nalco profit

 National Aluminium Company Ltd (Nalco) has achieved its highest quarterly net profit of Rs 283.04 crore in the second quarter ended September 30, 2005. 

 ?This is Rs 275.50 crore more than the net profit recorded in the corresponding period last year,? Nalco said today.

 The sales turnover of the company increased to Rs 1149.98 crore from Rs 1062.26 crore in the same period last year.

 During the first half of the current fiscal, the company achieved a sales turnover of Rs 2221.68 crore, up 13.72 per cent from Rs 1953.61 crore in the corresponding period last year.

 Half-yearly net profit rose 13.96 per cent to Rs 563.60 crore from Rs 494.53 crore in the year-ago period, the company said.

 For the six-month period too, the company?s alumina production increased to 789,800 tonnes from 780,000 tonnes and aluminum production rose to 178,097 tonnes from 156,629 tonnes.

 HPCL loss 

 Saddled with selling subsidised kerosene and LPG, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd today reported a net loss of Rs 22.14 crore for the second quarter ended September 30 compared with a net profit of Rs 294.31 crore achieved in the same period last year.

 However, the oil and petroleum products marketing company?s total income for the reporting quarter has increased 24.65 per cent to Rs 16943.82 crore from Rs 13592.68 crore in the year-ago period, the company informed the Bombay Stock Exchange.

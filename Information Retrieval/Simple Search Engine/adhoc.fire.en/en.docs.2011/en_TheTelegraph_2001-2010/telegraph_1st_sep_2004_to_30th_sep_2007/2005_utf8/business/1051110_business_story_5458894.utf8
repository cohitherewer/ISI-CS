 Paramount city service from Jan

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Calcutta, Nov. 9: Paramount Airways is set to take off from the city in January 2006, according to travel industry sources.

 The Coimbatore-based Thiagarajan group, which has major interest in textiles manufacturing, is the promoter of Paramount Airways Pvt Ltd. The airline launched its commercial operations in the Cochin-Coimbatore-Chennai-Delhi sector last month. 

 According to Manish Sharma of Pushpak Travels, the city-based general sales agent, Paramount will start its Calcutta-Chennai and Calcutta-Mumbai flights from January 6.

 Sharma also said the Thiagarajan group has earmarked Rs 600 crore for procuring five Embraer aircraft from Brazil. Of these, three are 70-seater and the rest are 75-seater.

 Sharma said the aircraft would have two-seater rows with larger leg space as is available in business class in a normal airline. The fare would be 25 to 30 per cent lower than the average business class fares and the passengers would be given full meal during the flight.

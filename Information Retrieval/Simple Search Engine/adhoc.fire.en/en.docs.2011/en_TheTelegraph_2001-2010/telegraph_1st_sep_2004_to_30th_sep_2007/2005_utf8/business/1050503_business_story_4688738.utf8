 Trai to take a call on mobile bills

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Help At hand

 New Delhi, May 2: Billing-related problems with your mobile phone may end soon.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) will attempt to analyse the tariff levied and calculate the charges for short message services (SMS), short duration calls and metering.

 A senior Trai official said customers individually and also through consumer organisations are increasingly complaining about billing-related matters. These complaints are about the inability to verify the bills from the operators? records, absence of clarity about the tariff scheme on which they are being billed and inability to select the tariff most suited for their needs.

 The telecom regulator today issued a consultation paper to examine the issues relating to charging of SMS and short duration calls. It would also review benchmarks for metering and billing, code of practice for billing accuracy in India, international practices and regime for regulating code of practice.

 Last year, Trai undertook a study of practices prevailing worldwide and the possibility of developing software, which could help the customer select a suitable tariff. 

 Two different programmes were undertaken. In one, Teri was assigned the task of developing software, which would help a customer determine the total outgo for a given usage pattern for any tariff scheme.

 The efforts made so far and the results obtained for the two metros of Delhi and Mumbai are available with Trai. This points to the need for more transparency and use of new software to resolve these problems.

 To build the confidence of the subscribers in the billing and call charging systems of telecom operators, an international consultant had been engaged to help carry out an audit of the metering and billing system of different service providers. The objective of the exercise was to help Trai define the parameters with benchmarks for fair and reliable metering and billing system. The auditing of the billing systems of mobile operators revealed that some of the process/ procedure being followed by the mobile operators led to customer complaints and the attendant customer dissatisfaction. 

 Trai has examined these problems in areas such as synchronisation of clock, charging for SMS, publishing of tariffs, charging for value added services, premium rate services, short duration calls, credit limit and bill payment period. 

 In order to bring standardisation and transparency in the procedures being followed by various operators, the authority has also developed a code of practice for billing accuracy in India, which has benchmarks for metering and billing system.

 Mumbai, Dec. 7: Red Hat Inc, the provider of open source solutions, today said it has gained control of its Indian venture after buying out the remaining 40 per cent stake from its local partner for an undisclosed sum.

 The company, a leader in versions of Linux software that can be obtained for free and modified, aims to invest $20 million in India over the next few years, chief financial officer Charlie Peters said. 

 The acquisition and the investment will help Red Hat accelerate the growth, he added.

 Red Hat has grown 100 per cent annually in India in the past five years and it aims to focus on state governments and educational institutions, Peters said. We have succeeded in Maharashtra and Bengal and our engagement with the government is set to go up, said Javed Tapia, president for the Indian subcontinent and the local partner who sold his stake to Red Hat.

 Elder buys Eli Lilly?s brand 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 12: Elder Pharmaceuticals has acquired the ownership of the Tobraneg brand from the US-based Eli Lilly for the Indian, Nepalese and Sri Lankan markets.

 Elder will launch Tobramycin, an anti-infective drug under the Tobraneg brand name, by the month-end.

 A press statement from Elder, which was silent on the consideration for this acquisition, said Tobramycin is an injectable antibiotic belonging to the aminoglycoside class and it is an original research product by Eli Lilly.

 Tobraneg is expected to fit well in Elder?s portfolio as the company currently offers a basket of anti-bacterials, including cephalosporins (orals and injectables). The addition of this brand is expected to further strengthen Elder?s product basket.

 Eli Lilly?s Tobraneg sales had touched Rs 5 crore last year with a field force of 180 people in India. Elder said the brand enjoys high popularity, especially among surgeons, gynaecologists, orthopaedics and consulting physicians.

 Tobraneg is mainly prescribed as an add-on with cephalosporins in severe infections and surgical procedures. Essentially, aminoglycosides help in reducing the chances of infections.

 Tobraneg competes with other molecules like Amikacin and Gentamicin.

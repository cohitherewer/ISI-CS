 Apeejay, Tatas join Terai Tea hotel build-up

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 GARDEN GLORY

 Calcutta, Dec. 4: The Tatas and the Apeejay group are brewing an alliance with Terai Tea Company to develop a luxurious hotel in Darjeeling district.

 Terai Tea wants to develop a hotel in its 165-hectare Kanchan estate in Darjeeling. Around seven hectares will be used for the hotel.

 Terai Tea director R. Kanoria said, ?Both the Tatas and the Apeejay group ? owner of Park Hotels ? held talks with us. We are waiting for the Bengal government to declare the project land as free-hold. All the tea plantation areas in the state belong to the government, which it has leased out to producers.?

 ?After the government declares the land as free-hold, we will start a fresh round of negotiations with both the parties,? he added.

 The proposed site is only 2 km away from Darjeeling. The total cost of the project is Rs 10 crore, which will be funded through a debt-equity ratio of 3:1. ?The joint venture partner will participate in the equity and also manage the hotel. Both the Tatas and the Apeejay group have years of experience in running hotels.?

 The company has already discussed with its bankers ? Central Bank of India, Bank of India and Allahabad Bank ? ways to fund the project.

 The Kanchan tea estate, close to the famous Happy Valley estate, is a small garden within the Terai Tea Company. It has produced 1.5 lakh kg of tea. ?With this small production the garden is unremunerative to us. So we have decided to convert a portion of the tea estate into a hotel so that it can generate revenues for the group,? he added.

 The tea industry is facing problems for nearly five years. While the cost of production is going up, the price realisation is not up to the expectation. This has forced many companies, including the BM Khaitan group company ? McLeod Russel ? to enter tea tourism.

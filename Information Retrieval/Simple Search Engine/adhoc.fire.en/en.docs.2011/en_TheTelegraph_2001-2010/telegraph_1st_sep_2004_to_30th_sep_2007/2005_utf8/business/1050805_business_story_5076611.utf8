 Views vary on share valuation 

 SATISH JOHN

 Mumbai, Aug 4: Large brokerages have come up with varying estimates of the real value of the Reliance Industries stock at present with the de-merger of the group looming in the horizon.

 UBS Investment Research has put out a buy report with an immediate price target of Rs 790, which is a 5 per cent discount to sum-of-parts valuation of Rs 840. We value RILs petrochem at Rs 300 per share, refinery and marketing at Rs 203, oil and gas at Rs 72, cash amp; group at Rs 107 and telecom businesses in RIL at Rs 111, the brokerage said. 

 A rash of research reports cropped up today as analysts scrambled to assess how much stock value the demerger would unlock and also estimate whether there was enough headroom for the RIL stock to rise in the run-up to the de-merger.

 Citigroup Smith Barney has targeted a price of Rs 801, which the firm said was based on a sum-of-parts value for RIL. It also rated Reliance stock as low risk. 

 Kotak Institutional Research was among the few firms to say that value unlocking would take place under the proposed scheme but said the share price already reflects that. We see the proposed reorganisation plan as fair and transparent. However, in our view, the price is reflecting the fair value of the core businesses and value of the subsidiaries. Our NAV is Rs 730 implying limited value unlocking from current values. Kotak also advised investors to book profits when the stock price overshoots.

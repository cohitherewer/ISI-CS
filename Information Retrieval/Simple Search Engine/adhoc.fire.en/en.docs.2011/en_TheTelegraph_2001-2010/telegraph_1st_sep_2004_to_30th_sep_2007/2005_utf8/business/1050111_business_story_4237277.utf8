 Rise in freight rates hits tile makers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 10: Tile makers have been hit after the Bikaner Transporters? Union gave in to the demand of the Vyapar Udyog Mandal Sangarsh Samitti to increase freight rates on ball clay despatches from Bikaner.

 The Vyapar Udyog Mandal has given in to the union?s insistence and approved a 42 per cent increase in freight on all clay despatches from Bikaner with immediate effect. Though material costs are unchanged, a rise in freight has propelled the landed cost of ball clay ? a basic raw material used in the manufacture of ceramic tiles ? by 40 per cent. The clay accounts for almost 70 per cent of the product input.

 Indian Council of Ceramic Tiles amp; Sanitaryware chairman Vijay Aggarwal said, ?The tile industry has been the biggest sufferer. The 42 per cent increase in freight has come as a rude shock. We are victims to the unbecoming ways of the union.?

 ?I am surprised that no one has thought about the huge costs incurred by manufacturers while producing high-end ceramic tiles. We are the largest users of ball clay, which we have to transport to manufacturing facilities from mines. Therefore, increase in transportation costs will hit us badly,? Aggarwal added.

 The new freight rates have propelled the landed cost of ball clay from Bikaner by 40 per cent.

 The increase in freight cost will severely impact prevailing economies and squeeze the margins of domestic tile manufacturers.

 This development further hits the industry already reeling under severe rise in input costs over the last two years. The manufacturing cost across the board has gone up by 20 per cent on a conservative estimate because of rising raw material rates, especially minerals like zirconium and titanium.

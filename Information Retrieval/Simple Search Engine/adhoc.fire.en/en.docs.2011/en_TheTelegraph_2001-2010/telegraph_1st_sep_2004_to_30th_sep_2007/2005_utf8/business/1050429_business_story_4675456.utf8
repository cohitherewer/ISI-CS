 Bandwidth tariff cut stalled

 New Delhi, April 28: The proposed cut in Internet and broadband tariffs has hit a roadblock.

 The Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) today asked the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to re-examine its recommendations that slashed the international bandwidth prices by more than 70 per cent.

 International bandwidth is the medium of carriage of data and voice services across countries in the world. The main users of international private leased circuit (IPLC) in India are Internet service providers, information technology and IT-enabled service enterprises like business process outsourcing units and international long distance (ILD) operators. 

 Tata-owned Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL), the international carrier of bandwidth, had approached TDSAT alleging that the regulators directive was detrimental to its business prospects. The company wanted to know the parameters that were considered while deciding to cut the international bandwidth price.

 ISD rates were also expected to drop, provided the operators passed on the benefits extended by the telecom regulator to the consumer. The price order, which was implemented on April 1, 2005, has been scrapped with retrospective effect.

 A senior Trai official said, ?The order has just come; we will respond soon.?

 VSNL, a major bandwidth provider, had challenged the order and pointed out that the price cut could not be determined in isolation and had questioned the regulator?s methodology for arriving at the price ceiling.

 The company claimed that the price ceiling set by Trai was below its basic cost.

 The international bandwidth service is generally provided through submarine cable systems and through satellite media. In India, submarine cable systems is the most predominant mode of delivery of IPLC services.

 The operators were free to offer tariffs that are lower than the ceiling fixed by the regulator.

 The IPLC leased rentals are the charges for using the services of the international leased circuits. These were found to be higher in India than in many countries owing to a lack of effective competition in the market. 

 For example, there are only three operators in India that offer this service against 14 operators in Korea, 24 in France and 32 in Germany and the US.

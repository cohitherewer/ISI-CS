 IA plane purchase plan goes to cabinet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 3: Indian Airlines has sent to the cabinet the details of price negotiations with European aircraft manufacturer Airbus Industrie for the purchase of 43 aircraft.

 Officials said the final price is slightly below Rs 9,000 crore. The CCEA is expected to take a decision on the purchase sometime later this month. 

 The fall in prices from an earlier quoted Rs 10,000 crore has been partly because of tough bargaining by Indians and partly because of a fall in the value of the dollar. 

 The CCEA is expected to agree to the purchase and at the same time infuse Rs 350 crore as government equity into IA besides allowing the airline to come out with a public issue to shore up its capital base. 

 The finance ministry has also agreed to stand guarantor to the huge purchase, which means IA will get a loan to cover the purchase at sovereign rates. 

 Officials said 90 per cent of the cost of acquiring the new aircraft will come from loans while 10 per cent will come from the airline?s own funds. 

 IA wants to buy a mix of Airbus-319s, Airbus-320s and Airbus-321s and they are to be delivered over four years between 2005 and 2009.

 The state-run domestic airline currently has a fleet of 56 aircraft, including six leased planes. While its fleet of A320s are relatively new with an average age of 12 years, some 20 planes ? eleven B737-200s and nine A300s ? are between 18 years and21 years. 

 In contrast, Sahara and Jet, IA?s two rivals, have recently inducted new planes bringing down their average fleet age to about 7-8 years.

 The main reason for IA trying to renew its fleet is that new planes will mean a far lower operational cost. A large chunk of the airline?s cost goes into maintaining old aircraft.

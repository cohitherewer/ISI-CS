 Rating rap for Ford, GM local outfits

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 7: The tremors in Detroit are now being felt in India. Credit rating agency Crisil has placed its outstanding rating of the short-term debt programmes of Ford India amp; GMAC Financial Services India on ?Watch with Developing Implications?.

 Crisil followed its lead promoter Standard and Poors (S amp;P) revision of ratings for Ford Motor Company (FMC) and General Motors Corp (GM) along with General Motors Acceptance Corp (GMAC), the international parents of Ford India and GMAC Financial Services India. 

 Crisil?s rating on Ford Indias short-term debt programme factors in the financial, product and managerial support that the company receives from its parent, which has recently been downgraded by S amp;P because of its ?scepticism about whether FMCs management strategies would be sufficient to contract mounting competitive challenges?. 

 The global ratings major S amp;P is apprehensive that FMC?s overall sports utility vehicle (SUV) business will not be able to sustain the profitability it has enjoyed historically. 

 The demand for SUVs has evidently stagnated worldwide, partly because of persistent high gasoline prices. FMCs financial performance has been heavily dependent on the earnings of its SUVs. Besides, Ford Motor?s sales of mid-size cars and large SUVs have recently plummeted. 

 In addition, competition has intensified due to the proliferation of new SUVs. Global auto analysts have been saying that Japanese Auto major Toyota has been gaining ground over the two traditional Detroit rivals with its market share growing in most of the car categories. 

 FMC is the second-largest automotive company in the world with a strong presence in the North American and European markets. 

 Ford India currently manufactures the Ford Ikon, Ford Endeavour and Ford Fusion for the domestic market and Ford Ikon kits for the export market. It also sells the Ford Mondeo in the domestic market.

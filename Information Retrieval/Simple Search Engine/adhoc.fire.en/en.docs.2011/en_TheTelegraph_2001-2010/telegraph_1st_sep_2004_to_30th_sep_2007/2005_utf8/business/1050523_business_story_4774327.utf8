 Big gains on no-claims

 Chandralekha Tulal takes a look at how you can derive the biggest benefit on a no-claim bonus on your insurance policies

 If you don?t make a claim on your car insurance cover, it sometimes might work in your favour.

 But for that you will have to keenly follow the motor vehicle insurance rules and delve deeper into the lesserknown proviso in the rules.

 Your agent may more often than not choose to overcome this moolah-saving quirk as they get a percentage of the premium as commission and the higher it is, the greater the gain.

 This is what worked in favour of Ritisha Poori when she got her brand new Honda City insured.

 Normally, she would have been required to pay a first year own damage premium of Rs 25,279, but with this small proviso she was able to bring down her first-year premium to about Rs 12,639.

 What?s the magic?

 Ritisha had made no insurance claims on her five-year-old Zen, which entitled her to a no-claim bonus each year and translated into much lower premiums. When she sold that car, she transferred the no-claim bonus to her new car and made huge savings on the premium.

 By transferring the no-claim bonus when you sell a car and buy another, you can save up to 50 per cent on premiums! Owners of two-wheelers, too, can use the same strategy, only the rates vary.

 ?Clause? amp; effect

 However, if you make a claim, you have to start all over again from the second year and also pay a mark-up in premium equivalent to the discount you were earning. In fact, because of this ?back to square one? clause, it sometimes makes financial sense not to raise small claims.

 So, look at it in a broader sense. Ideally, whenever your vehicle is damaged, get an estimate for the repairs. If the no-claim bonus you stand to forfeit exceeds the estimate, it makes sense not to raise a claim and instead pay for the damage yourself.

 Transfer trauma

 Let us look at another incident. On the expiry of her father, Preeti transferred the car in her name. Now when the insurance policy of the car came up for renewal, the agent informed her that the no-claim bonus accumulated on her father?s policy cannot be transferred to her.

 However, Preeti was not convinced. And true to her suspicion, a senior official of Bajaj Allianz General Insurance assured her that according to underwriting rules, in the event of demise of the insured, the bonus can be transferred to the wife, son or daughter.

 Look beyond cars

 The benefit of not making a claim during the previous year can also be availed of in health and personal accident policies.

 However, in these products, the benefit can be translated in two ways, first being a reduction in the premium and second, an increase in the sum assured, generally termed as cumulative bonus.

 For example, in an individual mediclaim policy of New India Assurance, a cumulative bonus is given on every renewal whereby the sum insured is increased by 5 per cent, subject to a maximum cumulative bonus of 50 per cent. Thus, one can get such a benefit for a maximum of 10 years.

 In the event of a claim, the increased percentage is reduced by 10 per cent subject to a minimum of the basic sum insured selected. Whereas, on renewal of a health insurance plan of ICICI Lombard, you will be entitled to a discount equal to 5 per cent of the premium amount.

 A similar method is followed in personal accident policies. However, in this case, the discount is sometimes limited to lower amounts. For example, Bajaj Allianz offers a cumulative bonus up to 25 per cent in such policies for a maximum of five years.

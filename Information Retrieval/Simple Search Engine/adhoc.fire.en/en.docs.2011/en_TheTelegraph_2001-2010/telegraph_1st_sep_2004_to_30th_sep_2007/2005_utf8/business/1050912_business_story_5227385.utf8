The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Blend of the best in new powerhouse

 SATISH JOHN

 Mumbai, Sept. 11: Aditya Birla Nuvo will focus on the high-growth businesses of asset management, pension funds, life insurance, garments, telecom and information technology.

 Kumar Mangalam Birla dubs it a size play by a blend of value and growth businesses. The group wants to develop its new businesses by utilising cash generated by the old smokestack ventures like fertilisers, viscose filament yarn and carbon black.

 We are migrating to high-growth businesses, Kumar Mangalam said.

 The consolidation plan for Aditya Birla Nuvo is based on an integrated financial services business with a strong product portfolio and distribution channel, said Sanjeev Aga, managing director of the newly christened company.

 Ever since Kumar Mangalam took over the group a decade ago after his father, Aditya Birla, passed away, he has been improving the businesses of aluminium, cement, viscose filament yarn, textiles, fertilisers, carbon black and a petroleum refinery.

 He acquired Indal from Canadian aluminium maker Alcan, sold the loss-making sea magnesia business at scrap value and sold the petroleum refinery business to ONGC. 

 At the same time, he got into sunrise sectors like insurance and asset management with joint ventures with Sunlife and acquired PSI Data and Transworks in the IT and ITeS segments. He has also acquired Madura Garments in a bulge-bracket acquisition from Coats Viyella, which is now showing signs of growth because of the booming retail sector.

 He entered telecom by setting up Birla AT amp;T. His group holds 50.2 per cent of Idea Cellular, which is likely to generate an income of over Rs 3000 crore in fiscal 2006 and has already reported a profit.

 Kumar Mangalam pointed out that the fertiliser industry is still heavily regulated because of which many of the groups plans have not been realised. 

 For instance, Indo-Gulf was in the running for PSU National Fertilisers, which was on the block until the government shelved the move. The companys proposal to expand the capacity of its urea plant has not yet been cleared.

 We are familiar with this sector (fertiliser). Deregulation is not envisaged, Kumar Mangalam said.

 We are marshalling resources for driving high growth, Kumar Mangalam told The Telegraph. The fertiliser business will give us access to funds for our other businesses at a cheaper rate, Sanjeev Aga added.

 Kumar Mangalam, however, made it clear that he has no plans to dabble in the sector. 

 Regarding the general insurance business, Indian Rayons chief financial officer Adesh Gupta said the new company has the skills in managing assets (mutual funds and life insurance) but not in managing risks ? an attribute of general insurance.

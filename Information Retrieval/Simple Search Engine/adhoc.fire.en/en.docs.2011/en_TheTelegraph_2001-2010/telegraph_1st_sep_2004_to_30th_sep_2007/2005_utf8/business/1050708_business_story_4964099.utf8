 Nicholas in Canadian deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 7: Nicholas Piramal India Ltd (NPIL) will pick up a 17 per cent stake in BioSyntech Inc, a Canadian biotechnology research company, for around $5 million.

 BioSyntech develops and manufactures cost-effective biologic implants for therapeutic delivery. 

 NPIL will buy 75 lakh shares of BioSyntech at Canadian $0.8 apiece. As part of the arrangement, NPIL will acquire exclusive rights for marketing, sales and distribution of BioSyntech products in India and neighbouring Asian markets.

 Moreover, both the companies have agreed to collaborate for research and development activities using BioSyntechs technological platforms. The board of the Canadian company will also include representatives of NPIL in proportion to its shareholding.

 According to NPIL, this arrangement depends on satisfactory completion of due diligence, regulatory approvals and signing definitive agreements.

 Meanwhile, NPIL chairman Ajay Piramal said at the annual general meeting that the company will shift the manufacturing operations of the UK-based Rhodia Organique Fine Ltd to its Hyderabad facility. 

 While the UK plant will be closed down, the process is expected to yield cost advantages to NPIL.

 Last year, NPIL had acquired the inhalation anaesthetics business of Rhodia for a consideration of Rs 58 crore. The company recorded sales of Rs 9.33 crore from this business in the fourth quarter of last fiscal.

 Piramal said the company would spend close to 4 per cent of its sales on research and development and would continue to go in for alliances and in-licensing of various products.

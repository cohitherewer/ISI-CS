 Plan to widen reach of MFs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 3: The Securities Market Infrastructure Leveraging Expert task force, set up under the chairmanship of P. J. Nayak, has recommended two options to increase the reach and service of the mutual fund industry.

 Apart from adopting the depository system for greater reach, the task force also suggested a distributor model for the industry.

 Submitting its report to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the task force said in the last eight years, the depository system has provided a bedrock for recognition of ownership of capital market securities, particularly shares, and has facilitated speedy completion of secondary market transaction settlements. 

 It has also aided the completion of primary market issuances. Besides two central depositories, namely NSDL and CDSL, the system encompasses depository participants (DPs). The NSDL network has 216 DPs (with over 1720 branches) in 241 different cities and towns

 ?The reach of the depository system is therefore, wider than that of the mutual fund industry, and provides points of contact, which could be adapted to service the mutual fund industry,? the task force added. 

 It should be examined whether the existing collection centre for a mutual fund can be replaced by a DP ? a point where investors or distributors deposit application forms, it said.

 ?The depository model could then become an alternative to the existing collection centre one. Moreover, every mutual fund would have the option of moving to the depository system. No regulatory compulsion is envisaged,? it said. The task force added that if existing collection centres and offices of registrars and mutual fund AMCs, which receive application forms, are also designated by the two depositories as limited-purpose DPs for transactions, the new model would subsume the existing collection centre model, offering investors an additional network of customer contact points. 

 ?The network of the depository system could be used to eventually encompass the collection centre infrastructure, which mutual funds currently use,? the task force said.

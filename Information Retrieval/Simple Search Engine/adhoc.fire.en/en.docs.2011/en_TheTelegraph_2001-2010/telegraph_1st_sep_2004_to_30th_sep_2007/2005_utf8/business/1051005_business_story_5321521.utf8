 Pentamedia Graphics in fake-share penalty

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 4: Sebi today stopped Pentamedia Graphics and its directors from issuing any fresh stock or altering its share capital after it found evidence they were dealing in fake shares. The company and its directors cannot tap the capital market or deal in securities until further orders. 

 The market regulator also cracked the whip on Vijay Advertising, to which Pentamedia had made a preferential offer. Vijay has been asked to retain the proceeds in its account and to use it for any purpose. Its directors have also been barred from the market. 

 Oriental Bank of Commerce and Cameo Corporate Services, the share transfer agents for Pentamedia Graphics, were directed to preserve the original records with them. 

 The information collected by Sebi revealed that Pentamedia had availed of various credit facilities from Global Trust Bank and had huge outstanding liabilities. Penta Media reached an understanding with Global Trust bank to restructure its dues. The share certificates, held in physical form under the name of Vijay Advertising, a preferential allottee, were pledged as security for the revamp fee that Pentamedia had to pay OBC.

 While these shares, which also had lock-in provisions, were with the bank, Pentamedia issued another set of originals with the same distinctive numbers to Vijay Advertising, which, in turn, pledged them with Gem Class P Ltd to raise a bail-out loan for Pentamedia.

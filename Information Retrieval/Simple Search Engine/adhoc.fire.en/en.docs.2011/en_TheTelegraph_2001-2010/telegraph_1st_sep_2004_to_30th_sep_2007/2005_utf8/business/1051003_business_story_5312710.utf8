The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Q amp;A

 Close to heart

 I have to undergo aortic valve replacement of heart, which would cost Rs 1.75 lakh. Is it eligible for deduction under specified medical treatment according to income tax rules?

 S. Dasgupta, Calcutta

 No, the medical treatment for specified diseases for claiming the deduction include neurological diseases, cancer, AIDS, chronic renal failure, haemophilia and thalassaemia. Expenses for aortic valve replacement is not allowed.

 Car conundrum

 I am a senior citizen and my total income is Rs 1.5 lakh. I own a house constructed 15 years ago, a car bought in 1995 and a landline phone. Do I have to submit income tax returns?

 Jaikishan Singh, Jamshedpur

 You are liable to furnish your income tax return under the one-by-six scheme for owning a car.

 Old is gold

 I am 80 years old and have an annual income Rs 2.91 lakh. I somehow manage to invest Rs 1 lakh in tax saving instruments. What else can I do to make my total income Rs 1.85 lakh, the exempted income level for senior citizens?

 Promotho Sasmal, Midnapur

 You can claim a further deduction of up to Rs 15,000 for medical insurance premium paid under section 80D or donations made under section 80G.

 No luck

 Do investments in equity mutual funds like dividend yield fund and multicap funds qualify for income tax deduction under section 80C? 

 Sugato Lahiri, Guwahati

 No, investments in open-ended mutual fund schemes are not eligible for deductions under section 80C. For tax benefits, you have to invest in the equity-linked savings schemes, where there is a lock-in period of three years.

 Duty cut to make edible oil cheaper

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 28: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today proposed abolishing excise duties on refined edible oil and vanaspati, bringing it in line with other edible products like wheat and rice that are not taxed.

 The industry also expects the move to result in a majority of unscrupulous players from the unorganised segment finding their non-branded loose package products no longer remunerative after the removal of excise duties.

 ?Our members will pass on the benefits to customers from tomorrow,? said B. V. Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors Association of India.

 Edible oil and vanaspati will get cheaper after the finance minister lowered taxes on the three crucial commodities affecting the common man.

 Govt clears funds for NJMC exit plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 24: The government has approved a Rs 978-crore package to help fund a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) in the ailing National Jute Manufacturing Corporation (NJMC)

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh cleared the infusion of funds, which will be used to pay arrears, gratuity and secured liabilities of the corporation, information and broadcasting minister Jaipal Reddy said after the cabinet meeting where this decision was taken.

 In July last year, the department of public enterprises asked the finance ministry to sanction funds to pay the statutory liabilities of provident fund and insurance for the workers of sick public sector companies. Payments due to NJMC staff was included on the list. 

 The losses of NJMC rose to Rs 3,973 crore against the paid-up capital of Rs 55.79 crore. 

 The Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) was reported to have issued an order on July 8, 2004 for winding up the company as its net worth turned negative to the tune of Rs 3,917 crore, eroding its paid-up capital several times over. 

 NJMC was referred to the BIFR in 1992. The company has been suffering persistent losses from the time it was nationalised in 1980. All its units have ceased production.

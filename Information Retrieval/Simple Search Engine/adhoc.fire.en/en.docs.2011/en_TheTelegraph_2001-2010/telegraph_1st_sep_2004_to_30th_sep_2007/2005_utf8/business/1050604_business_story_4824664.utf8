 New Delhi, June 3: The Union communications ministry today suspended the licence of DataAccess, the international long distance operator, even as it rejected the clarification given by the company to explain why it had not paid interconnection charges to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL).

 The department of telecommunications (DoT) had sent a show cause notice in March this year, asking the company to pay up the outstanding dues of about Rs 188 crore to BSNL and MTNL or explain why action should not be taken against it for violation of the licence conditions.

 DataAccess in its reply had contended that according to its records, the company had to pay only Rs 95 crore. But it was willing to pay 25 per cent of Rs 188 crore and was entitled to pay the balance amount till March 31, 2006, according to the licence conditions. The balance 75 per cent, the company claimed, can be paid in equal instalments over a 5-year period starting from April 1, 2006 without any interest.

 Such an agreement, the company claimed, can be offered to it under the licence agreement.

 The explanation was rejected by the legal department of DoT, citing that no such provision exists in the licence agreement. 

 The company could have gone for an arbitration under the licence agreement. But with the issue of suspension order it has lost that chance and will have to approach the courts for any redressal, said a senior DoT official.

 In its suspension order, the communications ministry has stated that non-payment of more than Rs 200 crore affects the viability of other operators and is against proper conduct of the Telegraph Act 1885. It is also in violation of clauses of the licence. 

 DoT officials said, DataAccess had submitted its reply last month but the points raised and explanation given by the operator were not found satisfactory by the internal committee. The members of the committee felt that the payment mechanism suggested by the ILD operator will impact financial viability of not only the two public sector companies but also other operators.

 Data Access secured the licence to operate international long distance on March 27, 2002 and had challenged to replace Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd as the leader of ILD operations in India.

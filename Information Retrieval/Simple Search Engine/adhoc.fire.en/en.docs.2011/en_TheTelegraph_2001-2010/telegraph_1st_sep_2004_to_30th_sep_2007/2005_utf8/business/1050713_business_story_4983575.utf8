 New drink to beat calories

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 12: Coca-Cola will launch Sprite Zero in India for the calorie-conscious consumer.

 The company said this would be the first such product in the country. The product, which tastes like lime, is targeted at the diet drinkers. 

 Vikas Gupta, vice-president (marketing), Coca-Cola India, said, It is the first light brand which has been rolled out in the flavours segment. The product will give a greater choice to the consumer and make carbonated soft drinks more appealing.

 Coca-Cola India will market Sprite Zero through roadshows involving experiential sampling sessions, the Internet and short messaging service contests. 

 A company spokesperson said the strategy is to own brand properties around the number zero. 

 The spokesperson said, We plan to run contests like if you have zero in any thing in your life?number-plates, address, birthdates... or get a Sprite-Zero label and you could win a years membership to various health and fitness clubs... the best in the country. 

 Till now, the low-calorie segment lacked innovation. It is fast becoming a lifestyle choice, he added.

 Sprite Zero will initially be available in Delhi, Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai and a few key towns. It will be sold in a 600-ml dimple bottle priced at Rs 20 and in a 200ml full-sleeved bottle at Rs 10.

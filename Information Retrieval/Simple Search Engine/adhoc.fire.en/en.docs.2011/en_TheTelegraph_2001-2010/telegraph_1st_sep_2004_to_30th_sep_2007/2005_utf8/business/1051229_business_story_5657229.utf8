 WTO deal, Safta on cabinet agenda

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 28: The cabinet is likely to ratify tomorrow the South Asia Free Trade Agreement (Safta), which is coming into effect from January, and the decisions taken at the WTO ministerial in Hong Kong.

 Under the South Asian pact, already ratified by Nepal, Bhutan, Maldives, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, member countries will reduce tariffs by at least 20 per cent in the first year and subsequently by 15 per cent every year to a level of 0-5 per cent within seven years. 

 Poorer countries, such as Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan, will get a 10-year time to reduce tariffs. However, all countries will have negative lists of items on which they do not need to reduce tariffs. 

 India and other countries will also follow rules of origin while permitting goods from neighbours at cheap rates. They will not allow goods from a cheap source like China to be transhipped to them without significant value addition by the South Asian country, which is supposedly exporting them. 

 India will also convert its specific duties into their ad valorem equivalents on certain textile items over a period of three years, which is likely to give market access to textiles from Bangladesh and Pakistan.

 Total intra-regional trade stands at a paltry $7 billion compared with South Asias global trade of $350 billion. The biggest gainers from Safta will be Bangladesh and Nepal as their exports to big markets like India are likely to rise 3-4 times.

 India is likely to record a lower but significant growth of around 30-40 per cent in the short-term from this accord.

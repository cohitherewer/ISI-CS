 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Call for all

 Mumbai, April 4: Allahabad Bank has fixed a price band of Rs 75-82 per share for its forthcoming public issue.

 The upper end of the band is at a discount of 18 per cent to the closing price of the bank shares on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) today. After opening at Rs 101.90, the scrip rose to an intra-day high of Rs 104.70, after which it ended at Rs 99.85.

 Allahabad Bank, which is ranked eighth in terms of assets, will issue 10 crore shares. Therefore, at the lower end of the price band, the issue will mobilise Rs 750 crore, while it will garner Rs 820 crore at the higher end. 

 The public issue will open on April 6 and close on April 12.

 Of the total offer, the bank has reserved 1 crore shares for its employees and another 1 crore for existing retail shareholders.

 Of the balance 8 crore shares, 4 crore will be allotted to qualified institutional buyers on a discretionary basis and 1.2 crore are reserved for non-institutional buyers. 

 The remaining 2.8 crore shares will be allotted to retail investors on a proportionate basis. The minimum lot applied for should comprise 75 shares.

 The issue is being made to augment the capital base of the bank and meet its future requirements arising out of the implementation of the Basel II norms. 

 The capital will also be utilised for general corporate purposes, including development of infrastructure to support business growth and service customers, besides meeting the issue expenses.

 Allahabad Bank, which has posted a total income of Rs 2,856 crore in the first nine months of 2004-05 and a net profit of Rs 462 crore, now plans to expand its retail portfolio by foraying into new areas. These include selling its own products in insurance and mutual funds.

 The bank also plans to establish operations in Hong Kong and has entered into a joint venture with Punjab National Bank to establish banking operations in Kazakhstan.

 Calcutta, April 22: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd plans to set up a satellite communication network to connect around 14,000 remote villages in the country. 

 ?Connecting rural India is one of our focus areas and we plan to reach out to over 66,000 villages in the next three years. There are around 14,000 villages that are inaccessible either through wired or wireless connections and we are trying to bring these villages within the telecom loop,? said BSNL chairman and managing director Anil K. Sinha.

 The state-owned telecom company has already started the work and plans to complete the rollout within the next 18 months. The remaining villages will be covered through WiLL connections.

 BSNL has been utilising satellite communication facilities to improve connectivity through the remote area business message network, which provides instant data communication between computers and data terminals. 

 The network consists of the master earth station (MES) and very small aperture terminals (Vsat). The Vsat is located at the user?s premises and linked to the MES through the satellite. This facilitates the interactive data communication. 

 The company also uses a mobile satellite service to provide encoded voice, data and fax services to mobile terminals and to fixed-line users for national and international calls.

 Sinha said BSNL would add 75 million new users in the next three years and 90 per cent of this would be cellular connections.

 ?We have revised the annual target from 10 million connections to 25 million,? he said. ?We are also working towards providing connections on-demand in rural areas and bring down the waiting time to two to three weeks.?

 BSNL is in the process of augmenting its network capacity. It has acquired switching equipment from Nortel at a cost of Rs 4,000 crore. The company is also working towards migrating from legacy to IP-based networks both in the core as well as local level for fixed and mobile phones.

 Outlining targets for the Calcutta and Bengal circle, Sinha said the two circles would add 6 lakh and 7 lakh connections respectively during the current year. BSNL has 2.6 lakh users in Calcutta and 2.83 lakh in the rest of the state.

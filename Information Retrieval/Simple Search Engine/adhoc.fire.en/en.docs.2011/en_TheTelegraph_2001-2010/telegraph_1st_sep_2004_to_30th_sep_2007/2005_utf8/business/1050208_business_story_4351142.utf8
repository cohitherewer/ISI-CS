 Warm US weather pulls down oil prices

 Downhill drive 

 London, Feb. 7 (AFP): Oil prices fell today on expectations of warmer weather in the north-eastern United States, as traders digested comments from the Group of Seven finance meeting at the weekend, dealers said.

 New York?s main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in March fell 40 cents to $46.08 a barrel in electronic deals.

 In London, the price of Brent north sea crude oil for delivery in March dropped 37 cents to $43.52 a barrel.

 Traders were examining the final statement from the G7 meeting of finance officials and central bank chiefs, who called on oil producing countries to increase oil output and consumers to raise energy efficiency.

 ?We recognised the importance of raising medium-term energy supply, of energy efficiency, and of the importance of technology and innovation in ensuring energy security,? the G7 had said in a communique at the end of the two-day summit.

 Meanwhile, traders were reassured by forecasts of milder weather in the northeastern of the US, which accounts for around 80 per cent of the country?s heating oil consumption.

 ?In our current predictions, it shows warmer conditions (in the Northeast of the United States),? said Eswaran Ramasamy, a Singapore-based director of energy information provider Platts.

 The focus will now be on the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries? output policies, Eswaran said.

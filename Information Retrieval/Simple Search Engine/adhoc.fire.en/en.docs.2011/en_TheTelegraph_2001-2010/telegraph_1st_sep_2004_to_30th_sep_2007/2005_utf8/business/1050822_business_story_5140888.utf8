 IBP merger hits the slow lane

 Calcutta, Aug. 21: With the merger of Kochi Refineries Ltd (KRL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) being deferred, folding IBP into Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) could take longer than expected.

 On Thursday, the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) put off the KRL-BPCL merger owing to differences between the ministries of petroleum and finance.

 The governments holding will be diluted if the present merger ratio of KRL and BPCL is accepted, the finance ministry said.

 The same issue is plaguing the IOC-IBP link-up with the finance ministry asking for a re-look at the merger ratio. Under the proposed ratio of 1:1.25 for IOC and IBP, the governments stake will be diluted by 2 per cent in the merged entity.

 The petroleum ministry, keen to go ahead with the merger based on this ratio, could have to wait longer, sources said.

 With the merger being delayed, IBP is exploring borrowing options from banks. It has written to a consortium of banks, asking for the terms at which it raise short and long-term loans.

 IBP has suffered losses worth Rs 233.97 crore in the first quarter of this fiscal as the government refused to raise oil prices even as international crude rates hit new peaks. If the trend continues, the company stands to suffer losses of about Rs 1,150 crore by the end of this year. However, it might have to borrow long-term loans from the third quarter itself.

 IBP has written to Canara Bank, Union Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, State Bank of India, ABN Amro, Standard Chartered Bank and HSBC for loans. Till now, the company has been availing of short-term (1-7 days) loans to meet payment obligations. 

 With losses mounting every day, IBP is looking at bigger amounts for the time being. However, it has to resort to long-term borrowings from December to meet the capital expenditure plan and working capital requirements.

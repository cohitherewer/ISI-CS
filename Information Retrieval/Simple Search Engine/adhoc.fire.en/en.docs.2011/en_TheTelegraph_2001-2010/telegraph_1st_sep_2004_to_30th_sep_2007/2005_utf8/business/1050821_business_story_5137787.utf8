 Paswan punch dims SAIL shine

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY 

 New Delhi, Aug. 20: The fight between Steel Authority of India Ltd and steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan seems to have intensified.

 Ashis Das, SAILs director personnel, has suddenly resigned from the steel giants board five months ahead of his retirement. Sources said Das had fallen foul of the ministers office. 

 To mollify Paswan, SAIL chairman V. S. Jain today shifted S. K. Rungta, the steel giants commercial director against whom the minister had ordered a probe, to Dass post. 

 SAILs director technical K. K. Khanna has been given additional charge of the crucial marketing portfolio. 

 The SAIL chairman himself is believed to be under attack from the steel ministers office. He is accused of farming out SAILs audit work to a firm where his daughter works. 

 However, sources close to Jain claim he had always declared this fact and stayed away from board meetings where decisions on the issue were taken. 

 Rungta went on long leave after Paswan appointed committees to look into allegations of irregularities in coal purchases, but rejoined after an order was passed two weeks back appointing Salem Steels executive director M. Roy in his place. 

 Rungtas return as commercial director is believed to have set off an unprecedented confrontation between Paswans office and SAIL.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Berger awash with tieup offers 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 30: Berger Paints India Limited is keen on exploring tie-ups with global and regional paints companies.

 Chairman Kuldip Singh Dhingra told The Telegraph, ?Many global companies are keen on entering the Asian market and we have been approached by them as they realise our strength in certain niche areas.?

 ?We have taken a conscious decision to explore various options to establish further foothold within the country and gain an entry in the foreign markets,? said Dhingra. ?We are still open to the idea of inorganic growth. However, the non-availability of a suitable target company has induced us to look at further options of organic growth,? he added.

 The chairman said although the company prefers technical relationships, it would also examine the proposals of equity investments.

 At present, Berger has six such technical relationships and equity joint ventures. It has technical licence agreements with DuPont Performance Coatings and Nippon Paint in automotive coatings, Orica Australia for protective coatings, Tigerwerk for specialised powder coatings and Nippon Bee Chemical for automobile plastic bumpers and plastic auto parts.

 The company also holds 48.98 per cent in Berger Becker Coatings ? the joint venture company with Becker Industrial Coatings of Sweden.

 The board will approve the buyback of its shares, the company has informed the stock exchanges.

 The company will buy back its fully paid-up shares of Rs 2 each at a price not exceeding Rs 60 apiece. The total amount will not exceed Rs 18.59 crore, representing 10 per cent of the total paid-up equity capital and free reserves of the company.

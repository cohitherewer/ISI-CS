 New has its own Apeal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 20: A study on automotive performance, execution and layout (Apeal) conducted by JD Power shows buyers delight with their new vehicles continued to improve in India for the seventh consecutive year.

 The study for this year is based on responses from more than 4,500 new vehicle owners covering 12 makes and 35 models and includes customers who purchased their vehicles between January and July 2005.

 Eight categories of vehicle styling, design and performance are measured to assess owner delight at two to six months of ownership, including engine/transmission; ride, handling and braking; comfort/convenience; seats; cockpit/instrument panel; heating, ventilation and cooling; sound system; and styling/exterior.

 The industry improved seven index points over 2004 to 787 out of a possible 1,000. Twelve out of the 21 models covered in both 2004 and 2005 studies show improvement in their Apeal scores.

 Two Maruti models top Apeal segment rankings. The Maruti WagonR ranks highest in the reclassified compact car segment. The WagonR is closely followed by the Alto and the Hyundai Santro respectively. The Maruti Esteem ranks highest in the entry-level mid-size car segment, and is closely followed by the the Ford Ikon and the Opel Corsa/Swing, JD Power said.

 According to JD Power director Mohit Arora, the compact and entry-level mid-size segments together accounted for more than 50 per cent of industry sales volumes.

 These segments, therefore, witness intense competition, resulting in a continuous effort by all manufacturers in the segment to upgrade their product offerings, he added.

 The Honda City ranks highest in the midsize segment for the third consecutive year. The Hyundai Accent and the Maruti Baleno come in the second and third positions.

 On the other hand, the Skoda Octavia ranked highest in the premium mid-size segment. The re-launched Octavia also emerged as the most improved model in the industry.

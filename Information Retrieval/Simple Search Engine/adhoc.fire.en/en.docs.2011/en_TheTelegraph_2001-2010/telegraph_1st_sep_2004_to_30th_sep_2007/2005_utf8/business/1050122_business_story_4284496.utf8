 Anil sound bites missing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 21: Anil Ambani, vice-chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, looked less feisty and pugnacious today than he did at the previous board meeting on December 27, perhaps keen to put off the fight till another day.

 He was in a hurry to enter Maker Chambers IV ? where the board meeting was being held ? and then scurried out of the venue, avoiding a far smaller scrum of mediapersons.

 Back in December, Anil had been spoiling for a fight and sent everyone into a tizzy when he quoted from Sun Tzu, the Chinese philosophers treatise on The Art of War, that ?you need to go to war to find peace?.

 There was none of that aggression in his demeanour today. He came in quietly in his favourite steel grey Range Rover, driven by his chauffeur. The media scrambled to get some sound bites: but there was none of that today.

 The Meswani brothers ? Nikhil and Hital (cousins of the Ambani brothers) ? were the first to arrive. Anil came in 10 minutes later at 9.50. Mukesh came in at 10 am, but none of them were in a mood to talk.

 The meeting was a breeze with none of the fireworks that were seen in December. The meeting was over in a little over 30 minutes, catching mediamen by surprise. Anil was behind the wheel of his Range Rover a little after 11 am and whizzed past bemused mediamen. ?He?s always in a hurry and drives fast,? said an RIL official.

 Y. P. Trivedi, 76-year-old tax expert and independent director on the RIL board, was more forthcoming when he sauntered out of Maker IV making his way to his second floor office at Atlanta, a skyscraper across the lane.

 ?The meeting went off smoothly and there were no areas of conflict at all,? Trivedi told reporters.

 Alok Agarwal, the new treasurer of RIL, had made the presentation instead of Anil?s confidant Amitabh Jhunjhunwala who had resigned last month.

 ?Things are changing for the better. The results were good. The stock markets will be happy. The investors will be happy; the government will also be happy,? Trivedi said later in his office. 

 ?Nothing will be brushed under the carpet. The company believes in total transparency,? Trivedi said when asked if corporate governance issues would be discussed.

 Asked why the brothers hadn?t met to sort out the issues between themselves, he replied: ?Nothing is impossible. I have always been an optimist. All the issues that were discussed today were seen and approved by the audit committee. Let the shareholders know that their investment is safe.?

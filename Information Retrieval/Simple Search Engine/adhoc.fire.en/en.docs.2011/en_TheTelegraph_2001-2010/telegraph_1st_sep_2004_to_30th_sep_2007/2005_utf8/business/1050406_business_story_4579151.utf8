 VAT stirs bitter brew for tea industry

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Taxing times

 Calcutta, April 5: The April angst is brimming over in the tea industry as the spectre of a VAT-induced price spurt stirs fears of plunging sales in states key to its fortunes.

 The month of troubles will begin with a band call and courtroom wrangles in states which have decided to tax the beverage at 12.5 per cent. Tea-producing states, on the other hand, fear a drop in volumes at auctions.

 Of the 18 states that set VAT rolling this month, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa will tax tea at 12.5 per cent, while Himachal and Jammu amp; Kashmir will bring down the rate to 12.5 per cent from 4 per cent. The rest ? Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Bengal, Assam ? have settled for a rate of 4 per cent. 

 The BJP-ruled states, which have not joined the VAT entourage, are imposing a sales tax of 8 per cent on tea.

 ?The 12.5 per cent VAT in Maharashtra will hit offtake at north Indian auctions. It is huge tea-drinking state, where sales of premium grades are high. Buyers there could opt for cheaper stuff,? an official of the Calcutta Tea Traders? Association said. Their peers at the Coimbatore auction centre echoed them. Of the 650 million kg of tea sold at home, Maharashtra sips 60 million kg. 

 Harendra Shah, director of Girnar Tea and president of Federation of Tea Traders? Association of Maharashtra, sees a price rise of Rs 8-15 per kg. His forum has given a trade bandh call in the state on Wednesday.

 In Andhra Pradesh, the wave of discontent has reached the high court, where a writ petition filed by the state?s tea merchants? association against the decision to impose a 12.5 per cent VAT is waiting to be heard.

 Shah warns of a shutdown at auctions across the country from May 1 if the issue is not sorted out by then. 

 ?We will take up the matter with Asim Dasgupta, chairman of the empowered committee on VAT. We will also persuade states to implement a 4 per cent rate,? said C.K. Dhanuka, chairman of the Indian Tea Association.

 Shah said there is a set-off clause under VAT on sales within the state, but not for inter-state transactions. Packet tea makers said they lose out on the input credit because packaging material is procured from firms outside Maharashtra in an arrangement that limits their benefits to those under central sales tax rules.

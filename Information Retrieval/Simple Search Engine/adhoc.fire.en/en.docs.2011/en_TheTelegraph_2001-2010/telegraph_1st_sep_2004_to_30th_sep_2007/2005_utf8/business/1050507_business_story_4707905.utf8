 Spurt in exports fuels manufacturing growth 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 6: The manufacturing sector is witnessing a robust growth, primarily on account of a spurt in exports, according to a survey carried out by Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci). 

 The survey on Manufacturing Competitiveness says India has become the manufacturing hub for a number of industrial products.

 Of the 100-odd manufacturing sectors surveyed, 28 recorded ?excellent growth? of more than 20 per cent in 2004-05, while a similar number clocked ?high growth? between 10 and 20 per cent.

 The sectors that recorded excellent growth in the last fiscal include electric equipment and machinery, telecom cables, construction equipment, colour picture tubes and air-conditioners. And sectors with high growth have been hydro electric power, phosphatic fertilisers, textile machinery, energy meters, oil and gas equipment, colour televisions, refrigerators and watches.

 The moderate growth sectors (less than 10 per cent growth rate) in manufacturing include the basic industries such as crude oil, petroleum refineries, aluminium, cement, steel and electric power generation.

 On the export front, textile machinery, passenger cars, commercial vehicles, utility vehicles, two wheelers, motor cycles, auto components recorded excellent growth.

 The survey states that there has been an increased investment by companies mainly in steel, auotmobiles and auto components, consumer electronics, pharmaceuticals and textiles. This has led to substantial capacity expansion in these industries.

 ?The recent bullish trend in manufacturing has raised the level of confidence in major industry segments. The optimistic outlook is mirrored in industries belief that growth in manufacturing will overtake the services sector. The manufacturing sector could become the leading growth driver of the economy provided pro-active measures are taken by the government?, the survey adds.

 The study also highlights various issues confronting different sectors. In the basic goods category, steel industrys major concern is the rise in excise duty on iron and steel from 12 per cent to 16 per cent which ?will affect non-VATable items badly?. 

 ?The high incidence of central taxes, octroi and royalty on the ex-factory cost along with high rail freight continues to plague the cement industry? according to the survey.

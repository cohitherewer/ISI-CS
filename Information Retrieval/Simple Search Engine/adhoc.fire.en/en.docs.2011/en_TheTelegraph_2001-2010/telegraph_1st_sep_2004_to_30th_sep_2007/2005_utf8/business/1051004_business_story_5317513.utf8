 TCS man joins Polaris

 Chennai, Oct. 3 (PTI): After Infosys and Wipro, its now the turn of TCS to lose a key professional.

 Arup Gupta, who was with Tata Consultancy Services for the last 25 years and donned his last executive role as president, North America, has left to join Polaris Software as its president and chief operating officer.

 I am excited to join Polaris and I am impressed by the strong focus of the company in banking and financial services sector, Gupta, who played a vital role in taking the TCS North American revenues from $200 million to $1 billion over a five-year span, told a news conference here.

 This is the fourth major movement of executives from among the top three IT heavyweights in the country.

 Recently, Hema Ravichander, senior vice-president (HR) of Infosys and the high-profile vice-chairman of Wipro, Vivek Paul and Basab Pradhan, global sales head of Infosys, had quit to pursue higher challenging assignments.

 Announcing Guptas appointment, Polaris Software Lab chairman and CEO Arun Jain said: Gupta brings to the table the same deep understanding and dynamism that helped TCS scale up and helped it to be at the forefront of global offshore delivery processes.

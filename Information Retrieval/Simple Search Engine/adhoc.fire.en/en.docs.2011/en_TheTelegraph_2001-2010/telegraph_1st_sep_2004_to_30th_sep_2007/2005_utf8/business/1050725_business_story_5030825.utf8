 Bad debt acquisition hits stamp duty hurdle

 MONEY MATTERS

 Calcutta, July 24: The Asset Reconstruction Company of India Limited (Arcil) is facing problems in acquiring sticky assets of banks in states that charge a higher rate of stamp duty. 

 In Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, where the stamp duty is a nominal 0.01 per cent, the asset reconstruction company has to incur a marginal cost for taking over bad debts of banks. In other states, where the stamp duty is much higher ? in the range of 7 to 14 per cent of the acquired assets ? Arcil has to cough up a huge sum towards acquiring the non-performing assets of the banks.

 High stamp duty rates are becoming a concern for asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) as acquisition of assets by them requires assignment of debts by paying the stamp duty. Thus the transactions become unviable, particularly for those ARCs which are operating on a thin margin. 

 Consequently, Arcil and other ARCs are avoiding states where stamp duty is high. An Arcil official said the company was focussing on aggregation of assets in states where the stamp duty is nominal to bring down the transaction cost. 

 Arcil has already acquired 368 non-performing assets worth Rs 16,500 crore from banks and financial institutions. This figure consists of principal debt of Rs 8,100 crore and Rs 8,400 crore in interest and charges applied till the date of acquisition. The banking sector has non-performing assets worth Rs 90,000 crore.

 Debt aggregation has also emerged as a major problem for Arcil. Under the new Securitisation Act, the borrower has to first agree to bring in 75 per cent of the disputed amount before making a fresh appeal. Similarly, 75 per cent of the lenders will have to agree to settle the debt. This, in other words, means that Arcil has to acquire the consensus of 75 per cent of the lenders while settling a case. 

 ?This has become a bigger issue than handling the borrower,? the Arcil official pointed out. He added, ?We are facing it as we try to acquire more and more assets.? 

 This issue creeps in more in a defunct company. In most of the cases, the asset reconstruction company is left with the role of preparing the lenders of the term-loan to share a portion of their pie with the lenders of the working capital as the former has the first charge on plant and machinery. The problem is more serious where the bank?s balancesheet has to take a hit.

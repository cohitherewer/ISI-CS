 Electrosteel lines up GDR flotation

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 20: Electrosteel Castings Ltd (ECL) will issue global depository receipts (GDR) to fund its expansion plan.

 The ECL board will meet on June 3 to decide upon the nitty-gritty of the issue, including the size.

 ECL intends to expand the ductile iron (DI) making capacity by 50,000 tonnes at its Khardah works near Calcutta.

 The proposed issue will take care of the funds needed for expansion, working capital requirements and high-cost debt retirement.

 Sources said Rs 100 crore will be spent for expansion and working capital needs.

 Once the board clears the expansion project, it will take nine months to put up the additional capacity.

 The present capacity of ECL is about 2 lakh tonnes, which the company hopes to expand to 5 lakh tonnes in the long term.

 The ECL stock appreciated by Rs 7.40 to close at Rs 411.80 or an increase of 1.83 per cent.

 The stock had a good run of late on the bourses. It has crossed Rs 500 and stabilised at this level.

 The Kejriwals hold about 63.16 per cent in the company as promoters. Financial institutions hold about 7.3 per cent while public have about 22.62 per cent stake.

 The turnover of the company is around Rs 900 crore.

 In the long term, ECL plans to foray into the long product category as well. This decision is based on the fact that ECL already enjoys a good brand recall in this part of the country.

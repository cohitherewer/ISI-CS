 Local rates out of Fed hike chain

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 10: The upward revision of the interest rates by the US Federal Reserve on Tuesday, the tenth in a row since June last year, is unlikely to have any immediate impact on the cost of money at home.

 Domestic interest rates in the near term will largely be governed by global crude oil prices, which have a direct impact on inflation and demand for credit, saybond market experts. 

 Many believe the Reserve Bank of India will hike the repo rate by 25 basis points in October, when it will announce the credit policy. It had done so in autumn last year. 

 Last year, the RBI raised the repo rate by 25 basis points to contain inflationary pressures triggered by high oil prices. But, in its first quarter review of the monetary policy for the year 2005-06 last month, the apex bank had left the rate unchanged at 5 per cent. 

 Bank analysts are of the view that while the increasing crude oil prices are still a cause of worry, what has raised expectations of a rate hike in October is the plight of domestic oil companies. 

 With these companies suffering losses of over Rs 140 crore daily, the ministry of petroleum on Tuesday expressed the fear that they will slip into the red from next month if the prices of petroleum products are not raised.

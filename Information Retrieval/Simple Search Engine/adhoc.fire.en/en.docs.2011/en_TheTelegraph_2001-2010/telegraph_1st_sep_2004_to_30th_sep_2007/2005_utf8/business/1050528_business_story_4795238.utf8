 Coal India eyes Indonesian mines

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 27: Coal India is looking to buy mines in South Africa and Indonesia through Coal Videsh, its long-planned subsidiary that won government approval today.

 Talking to newspersons here today on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Mining Geological Metalurgical Institute of India, CIL chairman Sashi Kumar said, We have taken the decision to acquire a 100 per cent stake in coal mines in South Africa and Indonesia. We will develop them on our own. However, if anyone wants to join us, they are welcome.

 CIL has identified some coal blocks in South Africa and has initiated talks with the South African government for acquiring them. Talks are at a nascent stage, Kumar said.

 Earlier, at a review meeting between the Planning Commission and CIL, it was decided that the coal major would look at overseas opportunities in a bid to tide over the widening demand-supply gap in the country and the rising trend in coal import. 

 The draft Coal Vision 2025, prepared by the Coal ministry, said Coal Videsh should focus on overseas greenfield projects and coal-block acquisitions, the investments for which can go up to as high as Rs 7,000 crore.

 CIL board had approved the proposal to set up the overseas arm in January. The proposal was then sent for the Centres clearance.

 Steel Authority of India (SAIL) is likely to pick up a stake in Coal Videsh for getting overseas mining leases, particularly for coking coal. 

 Coal Videsh would also bring the non-coking variety. The new company will first meet the domestic demand and then sell to the rest of the world, Kumar said. 

 Planning Commission has already expressed concerns over the yawning gap between the demand and supply of coal. Even if CIL and other companies achieve their targets in 2006-07 and 2011-12, the shortfall would be 55 million tonnes and 95 million tonnes, respectively.

 Supply of coking coal, the shortage of which has hit most steel companies, is likely to be inadequate since CIL produces a small amount of this premium-grade fuel.

 It may be mentioned here that Coal India and SAIL tried to bag a coal block in Mozambique earlier. However, the deal did not fructify since SAIL did not show enough interest in the Mozambique block.

 Coal ministrys draft document calls for a massive Rs 2,85,000-crore investment during the next 20 years to meet the rising demand. 

 The ministry wants coal production to go up to 1,061 million tonnes by 2024-25 from the current 360 million tonnes. Power utilities account for 63 per cent of the estimated demand for coal by 2025.

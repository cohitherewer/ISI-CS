 Calcutta, Jan. 11: SBI Life Insurance, a joint venture between State Bank of India and Cardif SA of France, will raise its capital base to Rs 250 crore from Rs 175 crore by the end of this fiscal to meet its growth plans.

 ?To meet the needs of our growing business, we have to invest Rs 75 crore by March,? said S. Muralidharan, chief marketing officer of SBI Life.

 The company hopes to complete this fiscal with a premium income of Rs 600 crore. It earned a premium income of Rs 373 crore till December.

 ?We are now managing a portfolio of over 20 lakh people, which is the largest among all other private insurance companies and have insured about 11 lakh lives so far this year, which is a growth of almost 190 per cent,? he said.

 The company enjoys a market share of 2.3 per cent among private insurers.

 Muralidharan said the company depends on the bancassurance model for its business. Nearly 62 per cent of its business comes from bancassurance.

 The company today also announced the launch of Horizon ? its first unit-linked insurance product ? which offers automatic asset allocation for no extra cost.

 Under the scheme, the customer can choosse his plan, the regular premium amount, frequency of his premium payment and the term after which the company determines the allocation of the customer?s premium into different funds automatically.

 ?We expect that 15-20 per cent of our annual premium will come from unit-linked products. In the next three months, we expect nearly 60 per cent of our premium to come from such products,? the CMO added.

 However, the company has no plans to depend on unit-linked products for its future growth. ?It is not desirable to depend on unit-linked products solely. Our focus will be more on traditional ones,? Muralidharan said.

 SBI Life has brought in 8.2 lakh people under group coverage schemes and has a market share of 19.4 per cent.

 The company has tieups with Union Bank of India and Dewan Housing for home loan insurance, and HDFC Bank for credit cards.

 The company has also signed corporate agency agreements with GE Countrywide, Kerala State Housing Board and Capital Finance Services.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Stage set for Bengal power reforms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Gaining pace

 Calcutta, June 14: Power sector reforms have gathered momentum in the state with the Bengal government floating a tender inviting consultants to formulate restructuring packages for the state-owned power utilities ? West Bengal State Electricity Board, Durgapur Projects Limited and West Bengal Power Development Corporation.

 Once the restructuring packages are worked out by the recruited consultant(s), the government will forward them to the UK government?s Department for International Development (DFID) for grants to implement them. The government will also approach other multilateral funding agencies such as the Asian Development Bank for loans to carry out the restructuring.

 The consultants will have to spell out measures as to how the state power utilities can optimise their business, taking into consideration the sustainable operational viability within the changing competitive environment brought about by the Electricity Act, 2003.

 The restructuring packages will also focus on organisational and manpower reorientation of the power companies and estimate the resultant tariff implications.

 According to the power department officials, the exercise is aimed at improving the efficiencies of the power utilities so that the consumers can get electricity at reasonable tariffs.

 The exercise for selecting the consultant(s) will take a month or two and they will have to finalise the restructuring reports within three months.

 West Bengal State Electricity Board chairman M. K. De said the restructuring exercise became necessary because power consumption levels were increasing at a steady pace and the competition has intensified following the Electricity Act, 2003.

 The state power utilities? reform is only part of the state government?s exercise to restructure the sick state-owned units. The second phase of PSU (public sector unit) restructuring, which the government will shortly undertake, involves nearly 80,000 employees.

 The government urgently requires to restructure the state electricity board which is saddled with an accumulated loss of nearly Rs 5,500 crore and has a huge workforce of 29,000 on its rolls as on March 31, 2005.

 Manpower restructuring is a major issue with the power board. The average age of SEB employees is 56. Most of them are physically unfit to undertake field works.

 The development grants or loans from foreign funding agencies such as DFID and ADB are likely to include compensation packages to be offered to the employees of the three state power utilities under the golden handshake sche me.

 The three companies also need financial re-engineering. The books of the three utilities are saddled with huge loans, which they fail to service. 

 ?We have earned an operating profit of Rs 270 crore and a revenue of Rs 4,800 crore in 2004-05. In the first two months of the current fiscal we have been able to earn a cash surplus of Rs 90 crore. The restructuring exercise will help us to clean up our books,? De said.

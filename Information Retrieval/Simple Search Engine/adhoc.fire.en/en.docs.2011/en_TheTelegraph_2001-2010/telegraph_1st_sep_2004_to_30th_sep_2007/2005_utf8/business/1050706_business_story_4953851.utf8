 Calcutta, July 5: Gillette India has launched a twin-blade ready shaver to capture the economy segment. The new shaver will be sold under the Wilkinson Sword brand, which has 15 million users across the country. Initially, it will be available in the east. 

 Sumeet Narang, regional business manager, Gillette India, Pakistan and South Asia, said, Market research shows that consumers in small towns and cities want to upgrade their shaving products but were restricted by high price. At present, 70 per cent of the users buy ordinary razors for shaving. Therefore, the growth potential is huge. 

 He also said the companys association with P amp;G will help it widen the marketing reach in the country. 

 Gillette plans to focus on the north and east for the Wilkinson brand and the south for the 7 clock brand. The Presto disposable blade ? the biggest brand for the company ? is growing at 10 per cent. 

 In 2004-05, Gillitte India recorded a turnover of Rs 406 crore and expects a 12 per cent growth this year. 

 The domestic shaving blades market is estimated between Rs 560 crore and Rs 600 crore at 4 billion units a year with 90 per cent of blades being conventional double-edge ones. Twin blades comprise the rest 10 per cent.

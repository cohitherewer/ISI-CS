 Ball rolls for limited liability partnership 

 New Delhi, Nov. 2 (PTI): The ministry of company affairs today came out with a concept paper on limited liability partnerships (LLP) and invited comments from all stakeholders.

 The ministry, which will accept comments till December 31, said the LLP is proposed as a corporate body and separate legal entity under a new law.

 According to the concept paper, although the ministry has not proposed any limit on the number of partners in an LLP, such partnerships should have at least two persons.

 It said liability of partners would be limited except in case of fraud, and has proposed to allow conversion of firm, private company and unlisted public company into an LLP.

 An LLP is a type of business entity, which protects individual partners from joint liability created by another partners business decisions or misconducts. 

 Therefore, a partner shall be personally liable for his/her own wrongful act or omission, but will not be liable for the wrongful act or omission of any other partner of the LLP.

 In the event of a business failure or disputes and claims, the liability would be limited to the partner responsible for it.

 In view of the increasing role of the services sector in the national economy and a wider range of disciplines in which such services can be offered as well as a growing number of professionals, a need has been recognised for a new corporate form, which will enable professional expertise to organise and provide a range of services, the ministry said.

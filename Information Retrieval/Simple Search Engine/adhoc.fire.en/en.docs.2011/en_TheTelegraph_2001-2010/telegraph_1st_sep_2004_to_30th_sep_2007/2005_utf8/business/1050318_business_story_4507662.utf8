 UTV hits bourses with a bang

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 17: UTV Software Communications Ltd has made an impressive debut on the bourses today.

 UTV shares gained 29.61 per cent as investors, upbeat on a dynamic growth in the entertainment industry, mopped up stocks.

 UTV shares were offered at Rs 130 in the initial public offering. The stock surged to a high of Rs 175.40 before it shed a small portion of its impressive gains to end at Rs 168.50.

 Analysts say rising advertising revenue in children?s programming and a healthy growth in film production and distribution will help UTV post a steady topline. 

 The company, promoted by Ronnie Screwvala, has raised Rs 91 crore ($21 million) through an issue of nearly 70 lakh shares, representing 34.1 per cent of its expanded equity capital.

 UTV proposes to use the funds to expand its film production and distribution business and the newly launched childrens channel, which is distributed by News Corp?s Star India network. 

 UTV makes content for STAR, Zee Telefilms Ltd, Sony Entertainment Television and Walt Disney.

 Among the listed Indian broadcasters are Zee and news broadcasters New Delhi Television Ltd, TV Today Network Ltd and TV Eighteen Ltd.

 Listed content makers include Balaji Telefilms Ltd and Sri Adhikari Brothers Television, which has recently sold its TV channel to Sony for $13 million.

 Earlier this week, Jet Airways Ltd made an impressive debut gaining 19 per cent over the issue price. Its IPO raised Rs 1900 crore.

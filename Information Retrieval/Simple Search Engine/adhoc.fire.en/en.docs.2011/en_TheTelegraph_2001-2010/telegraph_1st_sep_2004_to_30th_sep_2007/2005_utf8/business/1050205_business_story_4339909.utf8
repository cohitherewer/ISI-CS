 Canadian help in oil hunt 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 4: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar has roped in the Canadians to help ONGC analyse geological data to improve the probability of striking oil and gas on the onshore blocks. 

 Talking to reporters over telephone from Calgary, Aiyar said he had met the premier of the oil-rich Alberta province, Kline, who had agreed to sign a memorandum of understanding with India to make technical expertise available from the hydrocarbon research institute in Calgary and Alberta university to assist ONGC.

 The minister said, ?Interaction with these experts would help ONGC to think out of the box and generate new ideas that would lead to oil discoveries.?

 Aiyar, who is visiting Houston and Calgary to woo foreign oil majors to join the Indian oil hunt in the 20 blocks being offered under the fifth round of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP V), said his roadshows were well attended. Representatives from leading global companies such as Exxon-Mobil, Encana, Talisman, Total and Petrobras attended the roadshows in the two cities. He said he had one-to-one meetings with small and medium-sized foreign companies and was optimistic that there would be more foreign participation in the current round than there had been earlier.

 He also said there had been a large number of bookings for the geological data pertaining to the oil blocks, which showed that the companies were interested.

 However, he admitted that whether these companies actually come forward to invest in India would become clear only on May 31 ? the last date for receiving bids. 

 Major oil companies have been fighting shy of investing in India as it is not seen as a hydrocarbon destination and they choose to invest in exploration ventures in countries, which are known to have large resources of oil and gas. Only a handful of small foreign companies such as Cairn Energy of the UK, Niko Resources of Canada and Hardy Oil have invested in oil exploration in India.

 Aiyar claimed that the huge gas find by Niko Resources and Reliance in the offshore Krishna Godavari basin and the Cairn Energy discoveries in Rajasthan have changed the picture and India was being viewed as a good hydrocarbon destination. This was also reflected in the heavier turnout at the roadshows, he said.

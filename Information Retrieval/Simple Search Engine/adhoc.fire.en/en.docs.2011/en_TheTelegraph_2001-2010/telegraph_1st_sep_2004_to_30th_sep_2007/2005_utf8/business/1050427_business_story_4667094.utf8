 Shoppers? Stop IPO gets a jolt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 26: The initial public offering (IPO) of Shoppers Stop appears to be jinxed by a public interest litigation (PIL) filed against the retail major. 

 The IPO is not opening tomorrow. According to an order by the Shillong bench of Guwahati High Court, the issue cannot be opened till tomorrow based on a PIL filed by the North East Investors Association. ?There is a hearing tomorrow and we will get to know what the PIL is about. We will take a decision based on the order of the high court,? the company officials said.

 The IPO was scheduled to open tomorrow and company officials were expected to attend press conferences in Calcutta and Bangalore, which have now been postponed, officials said.

 The K. Raheja group company, which is the pioneer in setting up a nationwide chain of large format department stores in the country, has been directed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to postpone its offering.

 The proceeds of the IPO with a price band of Rs 210 to Rs 250 per share was expected to fund the retail chain?s expansion plans to set up 11 stores in premier cities across the country. It includes two hyper markets each in Bangalore and Pune.

 The public offering of 6,946,033 shares will be offered through the book-building process and the IPO closes on May 3, 2005.

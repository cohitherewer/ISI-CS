 Growth spurt seen in FMCG industry

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 18: The fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) industry is likely to clock more than 50 per cent growth in the rural and semi-urban areas by 2010, an Assocham study said.

 At present, the growth rate of the Rs 48,000-crore industry is 6.2 per cent. Of this, rural and semi urban areas contribute less than a sixth.

 According to the study, rural business will raise the industrys growth rate to 10 per cent by 2010. This will increase the market size to Rs 100,000 crore.

 The chambers analysis is based on feedback from various district industry centres all over the country regarding the future demand-supply situation of FMCG products.

 The growth in rural and semi-urban areas is expected to come from soaps, detergents, cold drinks, consumer durables, refined oil, toothpastes, batteries, biscuits, namkeens, mosquito repellents and hair oil.

 In the semi-urban areas, including large townships, a large number of malls have been planned in the next 2-3 years.

 These malls will sell large volumes of FMCG products, increasing their demand phenomenally, the study said.

 However, if this happens, there will be a severe pressure on the FMCG product margins, it added.

 Companies like Nirma, HLL, Dabur, ITC, Godrej, Britannia, Coca-Cola and Pepsi may benefit from this demand.

 The study, however, said low per capita disposable incomes, large number of daily-wage earners, acute dependence on the vagaries of monsoon, seasonal consumption linked to harvests and festivals will pose problems for the industry.

 Given the poor state of infrastructure, it is an even greater challenge to regularly reach products to the far- flung villages, the study observed.

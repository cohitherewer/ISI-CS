 Rate of inflation rises to 5.26%

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 15: The rate of inflation rose by 0.21 per cent to touch 5.26 per cent in the first week of 2005-06.

 It was 5.05 per cent in the previous week.

 The marginal increase is primarily on account of an all-round increase in prices of major commodities, including fruits, vegetables, poultry chicken, aviation fuel and manufactured products like sugar, tobacco, paper, rubber, plastic, and machinery.

 There are apprehensions that inflation could rise further if the cabinet decides to increase petrol and diesel prices, which form the bulk of transportation costs.

 Moreover, an international study by a banking entity has forecast crude could strike $100 a barrel from $55-56.

 However, some edible oils, wheat, eggs, barley, copra and non-food items were cheaper.

 The wholesale price index (WPI) increased by 0.4 per cent to 190.2 points during the first week of April. It was 180.7 points in the year-ago period.

 The government revised downwards inflation to 4.96 per cent for the week ended February 5 compared with the provisional level of 5.01 per cent.

 The WPI stood corrected at 188.5 points during the first week of February against the provisional estimate of 188.6 points. 

 The index for the food articles? group rose 0.6 per cent to 187.3 points owing to higher prices of poultry chicken (9 per cent), vegetables (5 per cent), ragi (3 per cent), fruits, fish-inland, bajra and jowar (2 per cent each) and fish marine, maize, moong and urad (1 per cent each).

 However, prices fell for barley (6 per cent), wheat and eggs (3 per cent each) and gram, condiments amp; spices (1 per cent each).

 The non-food articles group index declined by 0.1 per cent to 178.4 points due to lower prices of copra (7 per cent), linseed (5 per cent), castor seed (3 per cent), tobacco and rape amp; mustard seed (2 per cent each) and mesta (one per cent).

 Prices, however, moved up in the case of raw silk (3 per cent, raw jute (2 per cent) and raw cotton and safflower (one per cent each).

 The last financial year had ended with the rate of inflation lower at 5.05 per cent for the week ended March 26. 

 The wholesale price index inflation fell by 0.06 per cent from the previous weeks level of 5.11 per cent due to cheaper edible oils and non-food products.

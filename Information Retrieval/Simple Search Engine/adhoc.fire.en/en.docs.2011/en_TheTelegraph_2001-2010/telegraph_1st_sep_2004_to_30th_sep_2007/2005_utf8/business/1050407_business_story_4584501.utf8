 Panel to study scope of patents law

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 6: Commerce minister Kamal Nath today constituted a technical expert group to study certain patent law issues in order to fulfil the promise made by the government to the Left parties on the floor of the Lok Sabha when the new patents bill was passed on March 22. 

 The five-member committee will be headed by R. A. Mashelkar, director-general, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), and will include as members Asis Datta, director of National Centre for Plant Genome Research, Govardhan Mehta of the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, Madhav Menon of National Judicial Academy of Bhopal and Moolchand Sharma, director of National Law Institute, University of Bhopal.

 The terms of reference state that the committee will examine whether it would be TRIPS (trade-related intellectual property rights) compatible to limit the grant of patents for pharmaceutical substance to new chemical entity or to new medical entity involving one or more inventive steps. It will also examine whether it is TRIPS compatible to exclude micro-organisms from patenting. 

 The minister had given the assurance while moving the official amendments to the Patents (Amendment) Bill, 2005 in the Lok Sabha that the issue of patents for new chemical entities and micro-organisms would be referred to an expert committee. The minister had said if the committee suggested any amendments to safeguard the interests of these products they would be incorporated in the new legislation later.

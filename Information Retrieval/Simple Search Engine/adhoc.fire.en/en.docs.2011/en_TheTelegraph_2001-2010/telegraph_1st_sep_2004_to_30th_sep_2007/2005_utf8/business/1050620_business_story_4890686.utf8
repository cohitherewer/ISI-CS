 Bharat Sanchar cellular booths in trains, buses

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, June 19: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) will set up GSM public call offices (PCO) in trains and state buses along major routes in the country.

 The telecom major is in talks with RailTel and expects to start a pilot project in a Shatabdi train route by the month-end. We are finalising the routes on which the service will be introduced. The maintenance will be through a third-party arrangement on the lines of the PCO business, said the source.

 A GSM PCO works in a manner similar to a prepaid connection. BSNL will provide only the SIM card required for the service. The card can be recharged using a 16-digit PIN once the amount expires. The PCO unit will have to be installed by the franchisee.

 The fixed cellular PCO terminal can be operated on DC power sources like a car battery. A call made to a phone within the circle through which the vehicle is passing will cost Rs 1.50 per minute, while those outside the circle will be charged at Rs 3.00 per minute.

 BSNL has already issued a circular to the heads of its circles to pursue the matter with RailTel authorities and provide the PCO units.

 BSNL had entered into an agreement with RailTel in 2003. However, the project was shelved because of limited network coverage at the time.

 We wanted to strengthen our network and then go ahead with plans to provide value-added services, added the source. The expansion plans for the project will depend on the response to the service in the pilot stage.

 BSNL also proposes to authorise its STD/PCO operators to collect bills through cheques and demand drafts. 

 The marketing cell of BSNL has asked the CGMs of the Calcutta and Chennai circles to authorise booth owners generating an average revenue of Rs 5000 or more in the last six months to collect telephone bills, sources said. While the operators will have to install a computer on their own at their centres, BSNL would provide the bill-payment software.

 British Airways offloads Saatchi

 ALISTAIR OSBORNE AND DOMINIC WHITE

 Parting ways

 London, Oct. 10: British Airways has axed M amp;C Saatchi as its advertising agency, ending a 23-year relationship with the two brothers who coined ?the world?s favourite airline? slogan.

 The contract, part of BA?s ?60million-a-year advertising spend and one of the most prestigious in the industry, has been taken away from Maurice and Charles Saatchi after the airline instigated the first review of the account for 10 years.

 The frontrunner for the account is now Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH), advertising industry sources said last night. The other agencies on the pitch shortlist, besides M amp;C Saatchi, were WPP?s JWT and Omnicom?s DDB.

 BBH thought it had won the pitch a decade ago, only to see the prize fall from its grasp when the Saatchi brothers made a Lazarus-like return to snatch it back.

 At the time, they had just been ousted in a boardroom coup from the Saatchi amp; Saatchi agency they founded and much of their credibility hung on retaining BA.

 It is a piece of advertising folklore that it took all of Maurice Saatchi?s persuasive charms to convince BA to let the brothers? fledgling new agency keep the account.

 A change of advertising agency coincides with the arrival of Willie Walsh as BA?s new chief executive.

 It was, however, the decision of commercial director Martin George, supported by a trio of female marketing executives.

 Jill McDonald, the head of marketing communications, Jayne O?Brien, head of UK and Ireland marketing, and Elizabeth Weisser, vice-president of North American marketing, have been running the pitch alongside George.

 The decision will be a bitter blow for M amp;C Saatchi, whose chief executive David Kershaw admitted last month that the BA account amounted to 6 to 7 per cent of M amp;C?s worldwide revenues.

 He warned that losing the BA business could have a ?major influence? on the company?s second-half performance.

 Maurice Saatchi, the M amp;C executive director behind some of the Tory party?s most memorable campaigns, has told friends in the past that, while the BA business accounted for a relatively small amount of turnover, it represented more than half the company?s reputation.

 It was the late Lord King, the BA boss who piloted the company?s privatisation, who first hired the Saatchi brothers. Rebranding BA as ?the world?s favourite airline?, the Saatchis targeted its most profitable market ? businessmen flying across the Atlantic ? while retaining the carrier?s popular appeal.

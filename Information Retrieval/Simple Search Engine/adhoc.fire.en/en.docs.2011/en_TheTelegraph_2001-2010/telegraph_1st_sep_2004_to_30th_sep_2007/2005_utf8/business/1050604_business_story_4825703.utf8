 Rural banks ripe for merger

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 All in one

 New Delhi, June 3: The government has decided to allow consolidation of rural regional banks but will take a call on state-run banks after consultations with key allies, including the Left.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram said here today after a bankers? conference that the government would announce permission as well as guidelines for merger of the RRBs in a day or two. 

 ?Consolidation of RRBs is gathering pace. Nine states have given approval. It now awaits my approval, which will be done today or tomorrow. quot;

 If one bank has more than one RRBs in a state, then all these rural banks have to consolidated into one, he said, adding ?the entire process will be completed by August 31, 2005.?

 However, the process of mergers of state run banks which he had indicated in this years budget, will take off only after consultations were completed with allies including the Left parties which are dead set against it. 

 Chidambaram has already come out with a notification in February giving state-run banks freedom to buy out domestic and foreign banks, merchant bankers and finance corporations without government approval.

 The finance minister said that banks will be allowed to issue capital to shore up their capital adequacy, but in case of banks where state share-holding was down to near 51 per cent, banks would have to issue Tier II capital to shore up reserves. 

 He also announced that he had ordered two weak banks, including the Punjab and Sind Bank, to make a presentation before him on plans to turn-around their banks. Five other banks, which were not performing up to expectations, had also been asked to submit written plans for performance improvements. 

 All other banks will have to sign MoUs with the government promising to meet certain targets like profit and business growth, return on assets and equity. 

 Chidambaram also set bankers a target of bringing down bad assets from 3 per cent in 2004-05 to 2 per cent this fiscal.

 The minister said he had set a farm lending target of Rs 1,41,000 crore for 2005-06 as against Rs 1,15,000 crore disbursed last fiscal. He also said, quot;Credit to small and medium enterprises will be taken up as the next thrust area. quot;

 He also pointed out that infrastructure lending had surged from Rs 48,672 crore in 2003-04 to Rs 80,436 crore in March 31, 2005, but added ?we need to push infrastructure and I am confident that banking sector will repeat its performance this year too. quot;

 Sensex slides further

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 17: Soaring crude prices and negative FII activity today sent the sensex tumbling by 77 points during the last one hour on the Bombay Stock Exchange, even as global markets witnessed a meltdown.

 In a dramatic slowdown in activity, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) reported net sales of Rs 46.10 crore on March 15 after pumping in massive funds in February and during the post-budget fortnight.

 Extending its losing string to the fifth day in a row, the BSE 30-share index opened weak at 6719.11 and later reeled under sustained heavy selling and dropped to an intra-day low of 6640.88 before ending at 6669.52 against yesterdays close of 6746.88, a net fall of 77.36 points or 1.15 per cent.

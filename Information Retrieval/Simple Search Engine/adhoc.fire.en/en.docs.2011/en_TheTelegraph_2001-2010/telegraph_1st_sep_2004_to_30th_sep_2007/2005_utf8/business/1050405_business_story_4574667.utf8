 Threat ploy pays off in ITC deal

 New Delhi, April 4: The government has managed to pressure the Calcutta-based ITC into signing an agreement, under which the tobacco major will not press for a refund of the Rs 350 crore it paid as part payment for the Rs 800-crore excise demand raised by the revenue department.

 Last October, the Supreme Court had issued a verdict striking down the government?s demand. 

 Top revenue officials said the government had allowed an ordinance passed on January 25 this year that annulled the Supreme Court ruling to lapse because of certain flaws in its drafting. However, the government had used the ?threat? of reviving it while negotiating with ITC Ltd. 

 In return for ITC agreeing not to seek a refund, which it is entitled to under the Supreme Court judgment, the government has agreed not to bring back the ordinance or in any other way seek to recover the remaining Rs 450 crore in excise arrears from ITC.

 In a communique to the Bombay Stock Exchange, ITC said, ?the chairman of the company has signed a deed of settlement with the revenue secretary to settle this matter.?

 The government?s charge against ITC was that it had colluded with retailers in selling cigarettes at a price higher than that printed on the package and thus cheated the state of revenues. 

 Consequently, the government asked the Calcutta-based cigarette major to pay duty for the period between March 1, 1983 and February 28, 1987. 

 However, the Supreme Court later struck down the ruling of a central tribunal levying the huge amount on ITC, allowing the corporate giant a breather. 

 The government, which felt it had a justifiable claim, pursued the matter and invoked an ordinance, which would have forced ITC to fork out the entire money.

 Officials said they later realised there were certain legal loopholes in the law that could have been contested in courts of law. ?We consequently decided on a negotiated settlement and the ?threat? of bringing back the ordinance was the best way to reach a deal.? 

 Revenue department officials said, ?We realise the payout of the entire amount would have led to such a drain on ITC that it would have taken years to recover. This way we get money that we feel is justifiably ours, yet give the firm room to manoeuvre.?

 Govt issues new norms to protect tea quality

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 5: The government has issued a new Tea (Distribution And Export) Control Order, 2005, which stipulates that all tea consignments meant either for imports or exports would have to undergo a certification procedure whereby the quality and the country of its origin would be determined and displayed. 

 According to a commerce ministry statement issued today, the step has been taken to maintain quality and retain the brand equity of Indian tea.

 The Tea Board will be the nodal agency for the certification exercise. The non-preferential certificate of origin for each consignment of tea exports would be issued by the Tea Board or any of its designated agencies. 

 There were increasing instances of cheap tea being imported from countries such as Vietnam. These were mixed with Indian tea and then re-exported as Indian brands. This was reflected in the sudden spurt of imports of tea from such countries. 

 While unscrupulous traders were raking in a fast buck, the Indian brand was taking a hit and this would have spelt doom for the country?s tea exports in the long run.

 The new order also prescribes a minimum value addition norm of 50 per cent on export of imported tea and stipulates a time period of six months from the date of import for the export of imported tea. 

 Changes have been made in the handbook of procedures under the foreign trade policy and these have been separately notified by the director-general of foreign trade.

 The new order is issued under the provisions of the Tea Act, 1963 and supersedes the Tea (Distribution and Export) Control Order, 1957.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Charged up

 Mumbai, Sept. 2: Tata Power today said it would hold a 74 per cent stake in Maithon Power Ltd with state-owned Damodar Valley Corporation holding the remaining 24 per cent stake. Maithon Power will develop the proposed 1000-mw right bank thermal power project. 

 Tata Power said the project would have a 70:30 debt-equity ratio. 

 The private sector power firm has signed the shareholders agreement and share purchase agreement with DVC for the proposed power plant that is estimated to cost Rs 3,800 crore.

 Tata Power said it will contribute about Rs 840 crore to the equity corpus, and DVC will put in about Rs 300 crore.

 The project requires a 1200-acre plot and DVC has already acquired a significant portion of this. 

 The project is likely to attain financial closure in June 2006. According to plans, it will comprise two generating units. Of this, the first unit is scheduled to be commissioned in September 2009 and the second unit by March 2010.

 It is a greenfield coal-based generation project located at Maithon in Jharkhand. The site is about 250 km from Jamshedpur and Ranchi and 25 km from Asansol.

 We believe that joint co-operation with the government is essential in meeting the targeted demand for power in the country, said Adi Engineer, who heads Tata Power. 

 This joint initiative marks our first foray into a generation pact with the government. We also have other successful joint ventures with public sector enterprises. We have a JV with NDPL in distribution and with PowerGrid for the 400-kv Bhutan to Delhi (Tala) transmission project, he added. 

 The Maithon project is connected by National Highway No. 2 and is located on the rail network of Howrah-Mughal Sarai grand cord line of the Eastern Railways.

 In addition to supplying power to DVC, the plant will also supply to some states like Delhi, Rajasthan and Haryana.

 Tata Power has an installed generation capacity of over 2200 mw. 

 DVC came into existence on July 7, 1948, by an Act of the central legislature. It is the first multipurpose river valley project of independent India. 

 DVC stakeholders include the Union government and the state governments of Bengal and Jharkhand.

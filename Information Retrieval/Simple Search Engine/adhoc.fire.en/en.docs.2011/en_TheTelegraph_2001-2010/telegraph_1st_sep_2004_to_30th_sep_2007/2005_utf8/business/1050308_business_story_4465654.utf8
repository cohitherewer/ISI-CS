 Centre brews revival potion for tea industry

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Help at hand

 Calcutta, March 7: The Centre has appointed SBI Capital Markets to prepare a scheme for the replantation and rejuvenation of the tea industry that will be acceptable to banks as well. The scheme will be prepared within a month and tabled before the Planning Commission for approval.

 The appointment of SBI Caps comes in the wake of finance minister P. Chidambaram?s announcement in the Union budget that the government would examine ways and means of introducing a programme for massive replantation and rejuvenation of the tea industry.

 The government?s move was communicated to the industry by commerce secretary S. N. Menon. The Indian Tea Association (ITA) today met the commerce secretary in Delhi to discuss the health of the industry.

 ITA chairman C. K. Dhanuka told The Telegraph, ?This is a positive move by the government. The industry immediately needs funds to replant the old tea bushes to increase the productivity as well as to improve the quality.? The Tea Board is co-ordinating with SBI Caps in working out the scheme.

 In September 2004, Union commerce minister Kamal Nath had called a meeting of all stakeholders of the industry where he expressed his interest to set up a fund for replantation. It was decided that banks would form a corpus, which will be accessed by the tea industry. It was also decided that Punjab National Bank will be the monitoring agency. The Tea Board will be in charge of the overall supervision.

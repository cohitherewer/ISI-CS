 Govt revises DEPB rates

 New Delhi, Dec. 31 (PTI): In a New Year gift to the textile industry, the government has enhanced the export incentive duty entitlement passbook (DEPB) rates.

 DEPB prices have been revised for 83 product lines, including cotton blouses, children?s sweatshirt, gents long-coats and jackets and ladies skirts, among others.

 While value caps have also been fixed for most categories, a directorate general of foreign trade official said they refer to items with embroidery, metallised yarn or lining.

 Reacting to the development, Apparel Export Promotion Organisation director V. Mathur said industry was hopeful of achieving about 15-18 per cent growth in the months to come after the dismantling of the Multi-Fibre Agreement.

 According to a Crisil study, Indian textiles and apparel industry can reach $85 billion by 2010.

 The industry has already witnessed an investment of about Rs 50,000 crore in the last few years and has ramped up capacities to meet the challenges in the quota-free regime.

 According to an Assocham study, India can lose its share of the global textile market to China and Pakistan. 

 The chamber suggested a five-pronged strategy to improve the competitiveness of the sector, including flexible labour laws.

 Assocham said infrastructure and power sector reforms should be taken up at the earliest to ensure the smooth functioning of the industry and to give a leg-up to exports.

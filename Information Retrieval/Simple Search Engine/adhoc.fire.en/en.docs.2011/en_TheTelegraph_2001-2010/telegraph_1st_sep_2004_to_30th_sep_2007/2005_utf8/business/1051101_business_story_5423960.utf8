 Calcutta, Oct. 31: The net profit of Uco Bank has dipped by 49 per cent for the half-year ended September 30 to Rs 143 crore from Rs 283 crore in the previous year period.

 The bank attributes the decline to reduced profit on sale of investments, to the tune of Rs 68.27 crore, higher amortisation expenses of Rs 42.50 crore because of shifting of securities from available-for-trading (AFT) to held-to-maturity category and higher staff cost of Rs 56.55 crore mainly from salary revision.

 The operating profit of the bank has also slipped to Rs 326 crore from Rs 438 crore in the previous year.

 The bank has recorded a total business of Rs 80,960 crore against Rs 65,013 crore in the previous year ? a growth of 24.53 per cent.

 While the deposit base of the bank has increased from Rs 42,211 crore to Rs 49,816 crore, the growth in advances has been even more impressive ? 36.58 per cent year-on-year from Rs 22,803 crore to Rs 31,144 crore.

 Chairman and managing director V. Sridar said it has recorded a 10 per cent increase in its net interest income to Rs 770 crore from Rs 704 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.

 The bank has been able to recover Rs 186 crore of sticky assets against Rs 160 crore in the previous year.

 This has significantly reduced the gross non-performing asset ratio to 4.23 on September 30 and net NPA ratio to 2.62 per cent.

 The bank plans to raise Rs 400 crore Tier-II capital in the current financial year. Following this, the capital adequacy ratio of the bank, which now stands at 10.42 per cent, will rise to 10.9 per cent.

 We will then wait for the Reserve Bank of India guidelines for raising funds, to maintain higher capital adequacy, added Sridar.

 The bank has appointed the Boston Consulting Group to carry out an overall restructuring plan.

 The bank, which is implementing core banking solutions (CBS), will shortly identify its vendor. It plans to bring in 1,000 branches under CBS within three years. By March 2006, the bank excepts to bring at least 20 branches under the CBS.

 The bank will add another 50 ATMs in the current fiscal.

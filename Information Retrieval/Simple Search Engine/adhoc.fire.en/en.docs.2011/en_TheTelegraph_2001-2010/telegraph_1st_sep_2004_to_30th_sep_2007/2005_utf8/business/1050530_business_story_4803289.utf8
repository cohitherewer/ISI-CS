 Amul to sell packaged Orissa milk in Bengal

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 The milky way

 Bhubaneswar, May 29: Orissa State Cooperative Milk Producers Federation Limited is all set to piggyback on Amul to Bengal.

 If things go as planned, Omfed, as the federation is popularly known, will supply its milk to Calcutta where Amul will sell it under its own brand from next month. 

 Its in the pipeline, an Omfed official told The Telegraph. The deal is likely to be signed by the month-end.

 Amul, the flagship brand of the Rs 3,500-crore Gujarat Cooperative Milk Producers Marketing Federation, began retailing its milk in Calcutta last December and already sells over 1 lakh litres. Its entry has brewed a storm in the packaged milk market with its main competitors, Mother Dairy and Metro Dairy, announcing a 50-paise slash in their double-toned and single-toned milk. Amul now wants more milk to meet the rising demand. 

 Amul has not been getting qualitative milk from Bengal. Their officials found the milk from Orissa meeting their quality standards, said Omfed sources. 

 The federation would initially sell about 40,000 litres of milk to Amul and the quantity may be increased subsequently. Besides loose milk, Omfed would also market kheerakhand under Amuls brand.

 Amul will procure loose milk from Omfed, pack it in pouches and sell the same under its own brand name. Omfed now produces about 4 lakh litres of milk everyday through its nine dairies. Three to four years ago, Mother Dairy in Calcutta purchased its milk in bulk, but the deal ended on an acrimonious note.

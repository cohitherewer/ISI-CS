 SEZ export norms in place

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 19: All supplies made to special economic zones (SEZs) are to be treated as physical exports with effect from September 1, 2004 and will be entitled to benefits of duty-free replenishment certificate (DFRC) under the foreign trade policy, according to a commerce ministry statement issued here today. 

 More concessions have been extended to the gems and jewellery sector as well.

 The directorate-general of foreign trade has issued a formal notice in this regard conferring the benefit on units operating in domestic tariff area. The facility of drawback/ advance licence/duty entitlement passbook was already available for supplies to SEZs but they were not eligible for DFRC. With the issue of the notice, a long-standing demand of SEZ units has been met.

 A notification was also issued today allowing the gems and jewellery sector to import gold of 8K and above under the replenishment scheme subject to proper verification by way of an assay certificate. 

 Henceforth, the holders of diamond imprest licences will also be entitled to procure the inputs from indigenous sources in lieu of an import-against-advance release order. Earlier, this facility was available to advance licence and DFRC holders only. 

 The total exports of the countrys gem and jewellery sector during January to December 2004 touched the $10.34 billion mark which represents a 28.42 per cent jump from the corresponding figure of $8.05 billion for the same period of the previous year.

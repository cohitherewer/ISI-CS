 Market sees July 6 truce at Reliance

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 15: Crying wolf?.or settlement? Speculation about the Ambani brothers inching closer to a fence-mending deal reached fever pitch today as reports suggested that the truce would be declared on July 6.

 The day is Dhirubhai Ambanis third death anniversary. The buzz is that the settlement being structured by ICICI Bank chief and family friend, K. V. Kamath, is almost cast in stone. The question troubling most analysts and investors is whether the two brothers will have enough to control and own after their roles in the Rs 1,00,000-crore Reliance group are redefined.

 Whether July 6 brings forth the most keenly awaited deal in corporate India is still in the realm of conjecture, but a truce has been expected on key dates in the past too. One of these was December 28 last year, the birth anniversary of Dhirubhai. Markets were also rife with speculation on February 24, 2005, the birthday of Kokilaben, his widow and the mother of the Ambani siblings. The last was on June 4, when Anil turned 47.

 Deal or not, shares of Reliance group companies have hit the fast lane. Between the end of last month and today, Reliance Industries gained 7.41 per cent to Rs 574.95, while Reliance Energy jumped 13.63 per cent from Rs 516.35 to Rs 586.75. Reliance Capital has soared 22.84 per cent to Rs 240.90 from Rs 196.10. IPCL was the only listed company in the group which totted up relatively modest gains, inching up from Rs 163.35 to Rs 164.05.

 The market might be cock-a-hoop at the prospect of the Reliance scions smoking the peace pipe but the company officials pulled the drawbridge when asked about it. No comment, was the terse reply from a Reliance spokesperson. Badgered for a response, he added: The fact that they are talking about a settlement is well known. When it will be done is beyond our comprehension because it is a family matter.

 The most plausible settlement theory gives Anil control over Reliance Energy, Reliance Capital and Reliance Infocomm, while Mukesh gets Reliance Industries and other petrochemical firms like IPCL.

 A new permutation suggests the demerger of three companies into a special purpose vehicle where other RIL shareholders get their share and the family stake of 34 per cent is transferred to Anil. Both camps have denied this.

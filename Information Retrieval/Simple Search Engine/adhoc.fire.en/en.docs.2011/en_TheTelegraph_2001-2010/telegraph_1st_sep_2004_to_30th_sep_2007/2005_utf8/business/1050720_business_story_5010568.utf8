 VW damage-control drill rolls

 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, July 19: The Andhra Pradesh government is exploring all legal options to retrieve the Rs 11 crore it paid to the firm faking itself as a Volkswagen affiliate and to win back the Rs 6,000-crore project the German auto firm lined up in Vishakapatnam.

 Amid these efforts, investigation into how Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) parted with the cash to Vashisht Wahan has revealed that the brother of former industry minister, B. Satyanarayana, played a key role in getting the money out.

 Muralikrishna Botcha and two other prospective ancillary suppliers brought pressure on us to speed up the process. The procedures were cut short and files cleared without being sent to the state finance and law departments, said a senior official at the corporation. The government decided last week to hand over the probe into Vashisht Wahan to the Central Bureau of Investigation.

 It also appears that the Volkswagen headquarters was unaware of the existence of Vashisht Wahan, much less the governments payment of euro 2 million, till June 22. 

 Helmuth Schuster, the ousted VW executive who is believed to have swindled the sum, never allowed any Indian politician or official to deal directly with Volkswagen, said an official in the state industry ministry. 

 The AP firm had deposited the amount as its share of equity in the car venture, which was being shepherded by Vashisht Wahan. Even the understanding signed was without documents or VWs knowledge.

 At their meeting on Monday, Andhra ministers discussed how the car project could be brought back to the state. They decided to seek legal opinion on the options open for the state to get back the funds and the venture. 

 Chief minister Y S. Rajasekhar Reddy told reporters after the meeting that a delegation headed by a senior bureaucrat would visit Germany to hold talks with the chief executive of Volkswagen on the future of the project. 

 My team will hold discussions with the CEO of Volkswagen, not just his junior colleagues dealing with the project. Witch hunting is not the focus of the state team, which will only impress on the car-maker to choose Andhra Pradesh despite the controversy, Reddy said. 

 He said there would be no trouble retrieving the investment of Rs 11 crore. Both Volkswagen and our officials are striving to clean the slate muddied by Schuster.

 Reddy said he had written a letter to the CEO of Volkswagen in reply to the companys July 12 message. In doing so, he explained his governments stand on the issue. 

 Reddy also briefed Congress president and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi about the states role in the Volkswagen affair when he met her in Delhi this morning.

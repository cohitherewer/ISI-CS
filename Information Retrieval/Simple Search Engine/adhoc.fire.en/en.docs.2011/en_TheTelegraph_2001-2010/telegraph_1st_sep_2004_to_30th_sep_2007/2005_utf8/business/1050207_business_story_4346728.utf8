 New Delhi, Feb. 6: Liquor maker Radico Khaitan Ltd (RKL) is scouting for a plant in south or west India, even as its greenfield bottling unit in Uttaranchal is set to be fully operational. 

 Speaking to The Telegraph, Abhishek Khaitan, managing director, RKL, said, ?We are open to new acquisitions, whether plants or brands. We are negotiating with a few companies.?

 Declining to give names of the companies and brands with whom RKL is holding negotiations, Khaitan said the new production unit at Kashipur in Uttaranchal has already started the PET bottle production line. With this, RKL will have five company-owned bottling units and 20 under contract.

 Khaitan did not mention the amount he is prepared to spend for this new unit but said it could vary from Rs 10-40 crore, depending on whether it will be a distillery, in which case, the investment will be on the higher side of the range. Khaitan said if it goes for only a bottling unit, then the investment will be less. But he said it could be a combination of both, in which case, the investment will further go up.

 Emphasising that acquisitions and new plants are part of the growth strategy that Radico has carved out for itself, Khaitan said, ?About Rs 150 crore has been earmarked by the company for the acquisition of new brands and units over the next three years.?

 In July, Radico had bought out the 51 per cent stake of its joint venture partner, Baccardi, in Whytehall India Limited for $7 million. The company is now merged with RKL. The brand that it now sells ? Whytehall whisky ? totally belongs to Radico.

 In June, Radico had acquired its manufacturing unit in Hyderabad. Radico, whose mainstay has been whisky and rum, has recently forayed into the white-drink segment with white rum and gin.

 The company is also extending the Old Admiral brand. Old Admiral, which begun as a brandy brand, is also available in whisky and rum categories. However, it is only available in Andhra Pradesh. ?The plan is to make the Old Admiral whisky brand a national one,? said a spokesperson for the company.

 Radico had posted a turnover of Rs 727 crore last year. In the April-December period of this fiscal, the company has reported a turnover of Rs 721 crore, which is a 31 per cent jump over the comparable period last year. Radico expects the growth to continue at this level for the rest of the fiscal.

 Bill to set up oil board tabled 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: A bill to set up a petroleum and natural gas regulatory board for the downstream sector in the country was introduced in Parliament today. 

 The objective of setting up the board is to regulate the refining, processing, storage, transportation, distribution, marketing and sale of petroleum products such as petrol, diesel and LPG and natural gas in order to protect the interests of consumers. It will cover the functioning of companies such as Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum, Reliance and GAIL (India). Upstream companies such as ONGC and OIL will not come under the purview of this bill. 

 At present, the petroleum ministry regulates the downstream companies.

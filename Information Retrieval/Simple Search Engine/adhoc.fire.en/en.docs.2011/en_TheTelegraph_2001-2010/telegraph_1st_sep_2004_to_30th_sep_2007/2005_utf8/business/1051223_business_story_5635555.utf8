 State Bank ready for repayment of bonds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 22: The redemption amount of $7.3 billion (about Rs 32,850 crore) to be paid to NRI bond holders under the India Millennium Deposit (IMD) scheme by December-end will not cause any major problems to the banking sector, finance minister P. Chidambaram said today.

 We will comfortably deal with the IMD redemption, some of which is anyway coming back. The whole point of accumulating reserves is to deal with a situation like that, Chidambaram said. 

 The finance minister said India had a huge foreign exchange reserve of $143 billion and the banking sector was flush with excess funds. The redemption amount includes both the principal and interest accrued on deposits.

 However, critics have cautioned that with demands for industrial and housing credit going up, the redemption payment by State Bank of India could cause a strain on credit lines. 

 Chidambaram, however, said: Why do you assume that liquidity will be tight? We have enough reserves to take care of the redemption.

 The Reserve Bank has already infused Rs 9,200 crore in the market through reverse repurchase auctions as it anticipated a liquidity crunch.

 The governments optimism also stems from the fact that much of the IMD money is likely to be re-rolled through another deposit scheme for NRIs being planned by SBI and an offshore mutual fund.

 Analysts say at least a quarter of these deposits are likely to be retained by SBI.

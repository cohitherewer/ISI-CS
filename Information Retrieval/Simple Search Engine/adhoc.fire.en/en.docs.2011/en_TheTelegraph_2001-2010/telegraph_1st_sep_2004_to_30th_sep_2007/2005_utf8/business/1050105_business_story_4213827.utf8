 Morgan Stanley returns to Manhattan hub

 CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 New York, Jan. 4: Morgan Stanley, the investment bank that was one of the largest employers in Lower Manhattan until the attack on the World Trade Center, is returning downtown for the first time since 2001. 

 The bank, whose headquarters is in Times Square, is signing a deal to lease space on six floors at 1 New York Plaza, the 2.54-million-square-foot skyscraper at the foot of Water Street, according to state officials and real estate executives. In a boost for Lower Manhattan, Morgan Stanley plans to move about 1,450 employees from various locations in Midtown to the 50-story tower, beginning in June. 

 The move is good news for Lower Manhattan, which suffered an exodus of financial institutions after the 9/11 attack. And although a number of law firms have taken advantage of lower rents downtown, the vacancy rate has continued to inch upward. 

 ?Were encouraged that Morgan Stanley wants to be downtown,? said Charles A. Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corp. ?Lower Manhattan has a bright future. And it will remain the financial capital of the world.? 

 Andrew Walton, a spokesman for the company, confirmed that Morgan Stanley was leasing 447,000 square feet of space in the building, making it the bank?s second-largest office in New York City. Morgan Stanley is actually subleasing the space from Wachovia, the bank that is moving out of 1 New York Plaza this month. 

 About 3,700 people were employed at Morgan Stanleys World Trade Center branch in September 2001. Like many investment banks and insurance firms, Morgan Stanley quickly moved to Midtown and the suburbs. It bought the former Texaco headquarters in Harrison, NY, and moved hundreds of employees there.

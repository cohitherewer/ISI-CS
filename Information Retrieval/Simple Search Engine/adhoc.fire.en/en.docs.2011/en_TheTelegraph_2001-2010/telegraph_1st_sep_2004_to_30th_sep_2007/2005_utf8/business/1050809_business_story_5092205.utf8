 Local drug duo loses out in buyout race

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 8: Ranbaxy Laboratories and Wockhardt have lost out to Swedish firm Meda in the race to acquire German drug group Viatris. Meda will acquire Viatris at an investment of 750 million euros.

 Both Ranbaxy and Wockhardt were keen on acquiring Viatris to consolidate their presence in Germany and other parts of Europe. 

 Wockhardt is not new to acquisitions in Europe. It had bought Wallis and CP Pharmaceuticals in the UK. It is now the largest Indian generics company in that country after combining the operations of these two companies with Wockhardt UK. It also established a foothold in Germany last year by acquiring Esparma GmbH. 

 Wockhardt had raised $110 million through a foreign currency convertible bond (FCCB) last year to fund acquisitions in Europe.

 Ranbaxy, too, in its quest to become a global pharma player had acquired the German generics business of Bayer. 

 Other pharma players are also eyeing firms in Europe. Last month, the Ahmedabad-based Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd (TPL) announced the acquisition of the German generic unit of Pfizer Inc, Heumann Pharma GmbH amp; Co Generica KG, for an undisclosed sum.

 In a statement issued from Stockholm, Meda said it will acquire Viatris from Advent International, one of the largest private equity companies in the world.

 The Swedish speciality pharma company will pay 583 million euros for all the shares in Viatris and assume net debt (including pension provisions and similar obligations) of 167 million euros as on June 30, 2005. Therefore, the acquisition is valued at 750 million euros.

 Viatris operates through its own affiliates in 14 countries with a strong focus on big European markets. Its key therapeutic area is respiratory and the company has developed and currently markets the patented Novolizer, an innovative multi-dose dry powder inhaler.

 According to Meda, the acquisition will provide it with a well established and respectable marketing and sales infrastructure in various countries.

 Meda/Viatris will become one of the leading European speciality pharma companies. The combined company will also be an attractive in-licensing partner with its pan-European coverage in marketing and sales, its capacity in regulatory affairs and product development. The new group means a long term and wise industrial solution that will create values for both shareholders and employees, Meda CEO Anders Lonner said.

 Stake sales in Maruti, Bhel next fiscal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 25: The government is set to divest a 10 per cent in Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (Bhel) and a 7.5 per cent in Maruti to raise close to Rs 2,400 crore in the next fiscal. After a meeting with finance minister P. Chidambaram, heavy industries minister Santosh Mohan Dev said: ?We will sell a 10 per cent of Bhel shares and a 7.5 per cent of Maruti?s equity in the next fiscal.?

 Sale of a 10 per cent stake in Bhel is expected to fetch about Rs 1,600 crore, while the Maruti selloff is expected to fetch between Rs 800 crore and Rs 900 crore. The estimates are based on current prices. 

 After the sale of a 10 per cent stake in Bhel, the governments holding will come down to 57 per cent. At present, the government owns 18.24 per cent of Maruti Udyog. After the sale, its stake will fall to 10.74 per cent.

 The minister said the decision to sell the shares in Bhel and Maruti was based on the fact that Marutis performance has been good. Bhel too is expected to come up with impressive numbers. 

 Dev added that the finance minister had agreed to his suggestion that employees of Bhel be offered as many shares as they can buy.

 Money raised from sale of equity in Maruti and Bhel would be utilised for social sector schemes and also recapitalisation of the existing PSUs. The heavy industries minister has said that the public and mutual funds would be given preference during the sale of shares of both companies. 

 The Union cabinet and cabinet committee on economic affairs will meet on Thursday to discuss the issue. ?We broadly agreed on the views to be presented to the cabinet and CCEA (on the issue of divestment),? Chidambaram said.

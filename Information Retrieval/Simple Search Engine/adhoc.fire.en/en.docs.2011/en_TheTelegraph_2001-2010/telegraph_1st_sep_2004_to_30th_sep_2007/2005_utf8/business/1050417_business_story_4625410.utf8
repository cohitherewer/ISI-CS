 Calcutta, April 16: France today said India should step up imports of agri-based commodities to ensure better bilateral relations.

 French imports of agri-based items from India was 150 million euros, while Indian imports from France stood at only 22 million euros, French minister for agriculture Nicolas Forissier said at an interactive session organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here.

 He said this was highly imbalanced and should be corrected immediately.

 The minister said both the countries should work closely to increase cooperation.

 Two agreements were signed today in the field of agro-food processing in the presence of Forissier and Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 City-based Rs 400-crore Pataka group signed a memorandum of understanding with a French company ? 2AMIS ? for setting up a joint venture company for potato processing in Jangipur, Murshidabad.

 The cost of the project is Rs 250 crore. The French partner will have a 25 per cent stake in the joint venture company called Pataka Advanced Food Industries Limited. The remaining 75 per cent will be with the Pataka group. 2AMIS will also supply the necessary technology required for the project.

 The unit will manufacture glucose syrup, an important raw material for the confectionery and aerated drinks industry. 

 Mustak Hossain, managing director of Pataka group, said: ?Initially, the unit will produce glucose syrup. In the next stage we will also produce biscuits and toffees, which will be sold under the brand name Pataka and 502.?

 The company has already acquired 60 acres in Jangipur, Murshidabad for the project. ?Our idea is to develop a food park. The proposed project will occupy a portion of the food park. We will invite other companies to participate too,? Hossain, who also has a 100 per cent silk export oriented unit, said.

 Earlier, addressing the French business delegation, Bhattacharjee said, ?Bengal is rich in rice, vegetable, fruit and flower production. It is the highest foodgrain producing state in the country with a total production of 10.5 million tonne per annum.?

 He was speaking at an interactive session on France-West Bengal collaboration in agro and food sector organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce.

 Bhattacharjee invited the French to provide technology for the food-processing units and to set up units in the state.

 Nicolas Forissier, who is in the city for two days, said French professionals will help in providing the necessary technical help for the fisheries in Bengal.

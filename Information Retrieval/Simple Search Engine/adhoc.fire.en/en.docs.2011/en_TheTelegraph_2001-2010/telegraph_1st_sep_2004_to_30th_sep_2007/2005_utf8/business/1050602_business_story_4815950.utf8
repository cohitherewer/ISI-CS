 Captive sources in power play

 Sayeed: Upbeat

 New Delhi, June 1 (PTI): The Centre would draw 5,000 MW from captive power plants in two years to reach the Tenth Plan capacity addition target of 41,500 MW, Union power minister P. M. Sayeed said today.

 In the current financial year, as much as 2,500 MW from captive plants across the country will be linked to the national grid, having power of over 18,000 MW.

 Sayeed said the decision to draw from captive power plants was taken to exploit the under-utilised potential of the sector. Efforts will be stepped up to add new capacity during the Tenth Plan period, for which an outlay of Rs 1,43,399 crore had been made.

 This, Sayeed said, would considerably bring down peak-hour shortfalls.

 Ministry officials said 2500 MW would be made available to the grid this year, while the remaining would be diverted to the national grid from the captive power plants next fiscal.

 We are set to achieve 100 per cent target in the Tenth Plan, having already commissioned 10,950 MW and 24,150 MW programmes being currently executed, the minister said, adding plants with a total capacity of 1,815 MW are under active consideration for award to various companies.

 The outlay of the Tenth Plan has been increased by 214 per cent from Rs 39,450 crore in the earlier plan to Rs 1,43,399 crore in the ongoing one, he said.

 Criticising the previous NDA government, Sayeed said only 47 per cent of the capacity addition target was achieved in the Ninth Plan, while it has been 100 per cent in one year of the UPA rule.

 He said the national electricity policy was notified on February 12 this year and the guidelines on competitive bidding for procurement of power and development of projects are already in place.

 We are committed to bring transparency in the running of the power sector and hence these steps, the minister added.

 He said during the one-year rule of the UPA, highest average plant load factor (PLF) of thermal power stations is at 75 per cent, much above the earlier national average of 57 per cent.

 Almost 24 power stations achieved a performance level of more than 85 per cent PLF, the best ever so far, he claimed.

 The transmission capacity of the country was further expanded as a result of the robust and modern system that was put in place., he added.

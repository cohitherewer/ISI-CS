 Shiv Sena fat in ONGC fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today said he was ready to hold discussions with his parliamentary colleagues before deciding whether or not to order a judicial inquiry into the Mumbai High oil platform explosion last month.

 Aiyar made this concession after a verbal duel with Shiv Sena MP Mohan Rawale in the Lok Sabha during a calling attention motion by the latter. 

 Rawale dismissed the official inquiry, headed by former ONGC director S. K. Manglik, as a sham that would never get to the truth of what really happened.

 He demanded a judicial inquiry into the matter ? a demand that Aiyar was determined to stall.

 The minister said the skill of ONGC engineers had ensured that 70 per cent of the production of crude oil would be restored by the first week of September. 

 In the light of this, it has not been decided whether a new oil platform was required to replace the destroyed BHN platform. We have to first ascertain whether there is a need for a new oil platform, he said.

 Aiyar said though the platform had been completely destroyed, there will not be any significant financial loss to ONGC on this account as the platform was insured for $195 million.

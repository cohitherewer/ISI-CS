The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Goodricke focus on packet tea

 Cup that cheers 

 Calcutta, March 9: Goodricke Group Limited has drawn up plans to expand its packet tea business and double its volume every three years. The producers of quality Darjeeling tea will run it as a separate profit centre.

 Even though the company is not spinning off the packet tea business into a separate company, it will run independently and generate funds for its further expansion.

 The company sells 7-8 million kgs of tea through packets. The group sets aside 25 per cent of its own production of 30 million kgs for the packets and also lifts some amount from north Indian auctions.

 Goodricke managing director K. S. David said it also plans to extend its foray into the export market by developing a range of exquisite retail packs to offer its customers the best of Darjeeling, Assam orthodox and the strong CTC tea.

 The company is drawing up plans to double the instant capacity at its Aibheel plant (a 100 per cent export-oriented unit), based on the response from its export clients and domestic buyers like Coca Cola and Hindustan Lever, said David. 

 Goodricke had set up its instant tea plant in 1994.

 The company recently expanded the capacity to 600 tonnes per annum and will take up the expansion programme in the second half of 2005. 

 Goodricke currently enjoys a 6 per cent market share in the packet tea segment. In the Darjeeling portfolio, the company has brands like Castleton, Badamtam for the niche segments and Thurbo and Goodricke roasted and premium Darjeeling for the household consumer. The company has also been retailing its Darjeeling green tea.

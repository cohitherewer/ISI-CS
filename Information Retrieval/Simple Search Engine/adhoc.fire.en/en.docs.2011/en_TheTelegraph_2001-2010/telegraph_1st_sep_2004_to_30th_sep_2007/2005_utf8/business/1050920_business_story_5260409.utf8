 Calcutta, Sept. 19: Eveready Industries is eyeing overseas acquisitions and will appoint a merchant banker to scout for battery brands in Southeast Asia, Russia and east Europe.

 We are hungry for acquisitions. We are planning an overseas buyout by the next financial year, said Deepak Khaitan, executive vice-chairman and managing director of Eveready.

 The BM Khaitan group is buying out the battery business of BPL Ltd. Elaborating on the deal, Khaitan said a memorandum of understanding was signed with BPL on Friday. 

 Eveready will acquire 4.9 crore shares of Rs 10 each, representing the entire paid-up share capital of BPL Soft Energy Systems Limited (BSESL), a 100 per cent subsidiary of BPL Limited.

 BSESL manufactures dry cell batteries and flashlights. Its factory at Maddur, Karnataka, has a capacity of 240 million dry cell batteries per annum. BSESL makes up about 10 per cent of the dry cell battery market. It has pre-tax earnings of Rs 11 crore and an employee strength of 300. 

 Eveready will have to pay Rs 45 crore for the shares and shell out Rs 22 crore to meet the net liabilities (including term loans and bank borrowings) of the BPL subsidiary. It will do a due diligence within 10 days.

 The acquisition will be completed by October 28, when BSESL will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eveready. It will continue with the BPL brand name on the batteries produced at Maddur factory for 30 months.

 Khaitan said, We have added 9 per cent market share through this acquisition. Moreover, there was a threat from the multinationals and domestic FMCG companies for acquiring BSESL. They would have gained market share by cutting down prices. Eveready enjoys a 47 per cent market share in the battery business.

 The promoters of BPL had approached Eveready for selling their battery business. 

 They want to remain in CTV and electronic business and get out of batteries. We thought it was the right time to strike the deal, Khaitan added. He feels the acquisition will speed up the topline growth of the company.

 Khaitan said Eveready will add new brands in the packet tea business in this fiscal.

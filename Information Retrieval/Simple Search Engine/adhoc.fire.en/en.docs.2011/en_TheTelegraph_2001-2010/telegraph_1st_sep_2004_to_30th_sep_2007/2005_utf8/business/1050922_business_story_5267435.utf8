 Khaitans make open offer for Williamson Tea 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 21: After a delay of over one-and-half months, the McLeod Russel open offer for 20 per cent of Williamson Tea Assam opened today.

 The offer was scheduled to open on August 1. However, it was delayed pending a clearance from the Securities and Exchange Board of India. Lead manager ICICI Securities today informed the bourses about the revised schedule of the offer, which will close on October 10.

 McLeod will buy up to 2,83,5000 fully-paid-up shares of Williamson Tea Assam at Rs 145.

 McLeod Russel, the BM Khaitan group company, had acquired 70 per cent of Borelli Tea Holdings Limited, the holding company of Williamson Tea Assam. 

 According to Sebi requirements, McLeod Russel, along with four other group companies, had made a public announcement on June 1 for an open offer for 20 per cent of Williamson Tea. By June 30, the company had sent a draft letter of offer to Sebi where McLeod Russel proposed to make the open offer on August 1.

 The offer price of Rs 145 had been calculated based on the average price of last 26 weeks or the daily price of last two weeks, whichever was higher. ICICI Securities has structured the deal on behalf of McLeod Russel India Ltd, Williamson Magor amp; Co Ltd, United Machine Co Ltd, Ichamati Investments Ltd and Nitya Holdings amp; Properties Pvt Ltd (collectively referred to as acquirers) under the Sebi takeover regulations.

 Now that the offer is back on track, Williamson Magor, along with United Machine Company, Ichamati Investments and Nitya Holdings amp; Properties, has taken a loan of Rs 41 crore from IL amp;FS to participate in the open offer. 

 The loan, which carries a coupon rate of 9.5?10 per cent, has been put in an escrow account of Standard Chartered Bank.

 The acquirers intend to review the business affairs and financial position of Williamson Tea Assam from time to time. 

 Based on the evaluation and and general economic and industry conditions, they will consider various alternative courses of action.

 This could include the sale of all or a portion of the shares in the open market in privately negotiated transactions.

 McLeod Russel had been waiting for long to get Sebi approval for the open offer. Aditya Khaitan, managing director of McLeod Russel, went on record saying that the expansion plans of the company had been put on hold due to the delay in getting clearances.

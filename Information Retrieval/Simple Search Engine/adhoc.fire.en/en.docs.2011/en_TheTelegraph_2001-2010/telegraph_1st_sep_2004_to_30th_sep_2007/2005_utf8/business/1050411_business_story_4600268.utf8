 Swift zooms to top of Maruti rollout roster

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ready to go 

 New Delhi, April 10: Maruti Udyog Ltd plans to launch the Suzuki Swift, its premium hatchback, late next month. It will carry a sticker price of Rs 4.5-5 lakh.

 The rollout plan for the 1.3-litre petrol model was discussed at a recent meeting held at Hamamatsu, Suzuki?s global headquarters in Japan.

 Strategically positioned between the B and C segments, the car is being designed by a European design house. 

 The much-awaited Swift is the biggest launch from the Maruti stable in the last 20 years (effectively, after the Maruti 800). The car promises to create a separate segment altogether in the Indian auto industry in terms of space and comfort. 

 Swift was first showcased at the Paris Auto Show and is based on the Concept S car. 

 Sources say a direct injection diesel version will be introduced in 2006 after Maruti?s new diesel engine manufacturing facility goes on stream.

 Around 21 Indian engineers have worked with their Suzuki counterparts on the design and development of this global model. 

 Swift will be the first global model from the Suzuki stable. It will possibly be labelled higher than a Wagon R, an Alto or even a Santro, said sources.

 After making its debut in India, the car is expected to hit the roads of two other markets ? China and Hungary. This will mark Swift?s entry in three other countries outside Japan. 

 During the recent visit to Hamamatsu, the Maruti Udyog board of directors, led by managing director Jagdish Khattar, approved a mega Rs 3,271.9-crore investment plan for Maruti.

 The Indian car market, which grew at 20 per cent last year, is likely to see greater excitement this year with several automobile firms preparing for a slew of model launches.

 These include Toyota Kirloskar, Honda, Maruti and Skoda.

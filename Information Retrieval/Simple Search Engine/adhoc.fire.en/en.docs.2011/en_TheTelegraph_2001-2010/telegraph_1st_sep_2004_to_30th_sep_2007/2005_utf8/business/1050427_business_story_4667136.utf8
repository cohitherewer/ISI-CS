 Fast-track approval for Orissa projects

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, April 26: Investors in Orissa can get their projects cleared faster with the state government framing rules for a single-window system under the Orissa Industries (Facilitation) Act, 2005.

 The investors can now get the clearance from the office of the Industrial Promotion and Investment Corporation Limited (Ipicol) ? the single-window clearing authority.

 Though the government had framed the single-window mechanism under the industrial policy, it had not set the rules required for standardising the system. The rules were finally framed last week.

 With the launch of the mechanism, industrial houses and entrepreneurs keen to invest in the state can now get all the information and clearances from a single office. While Ipicol will be the nodal agency for the implementation of the system at the state level, the district industries centres (DICs) will implement at the district level.

 A high-level clearance authority, headed by chief minister Naveen Patnaik, has been constituted to approve investments of Rs 50 crore or more. The State Level Single Window Clearance Authority (SLSWCA), headed by the chief secretary, has been empowered to clear projects with investments of Rs 3 crore to Rs 50 crore. The SLSWCA will process and scrutinise the applications submitted to the high-level authority on its behalf. It will also monitor and review the functioning of the district-level clearance authorities.

 The district-level authorities will be headed by district collectors. These authorities have been empowered to clear investment of Rs 3 crore or less in their respective districts.

 Applicants can also appeal against the decision of the authorities at the Appeal Authority constituted for this purpose. At the state level, Ipicol will provide secretariat service for the entrepreneurs, while DICs will do the job at the district level.

 A fee of Rs 1000 will be collected for processing applications for establishment of industries with project costs less than Rs 3 crore. The processing fee for projects worth Rs 3 crore-Rs 50 crore has been Rs 20,000. For steel, aluminium and ferro alloy projects with more than Rs 50 crore investment, the processing fee will be Rs 1 lakh. The processing fee for other industries with investment of more than Rs 50 crore has been fixed at Rs 50,000.

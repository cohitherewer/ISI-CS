 Singh and Chidambaram: Taking stock 

 New Delhi, June 21: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today held discussions with agriculture minister Sharad Pawar and finance minister P. Chidambaram on foodgrain stocks in the backdrop of the delayed monsoon and depletion in wheat stocks because of lower procurement in April-May. 

 Though the government has adopted a wait-and-watch policy on monsoon, it is weighing the option of importing wheat if the need arises. Pawar is believed to have informed the Prime Minister of this contingency plan. Recently, the government had to import sugar to cool down prices. 

 Sources said the government had managed to procure about 14.8 million tonnes (MT) of wheat in the last harvesting season, which was 2 MT lower than the target. As a result, for the first time in several years, India will have less wheat in its silos than the buffer stock norms. 

 According to the calculations of food experts and agronomists, India should have about 17.1 MT of wheat on July 1. Sources said the actual stocks could be 2.5 MT less because of lower procurement. The norm figure has recently been revised upwards, taking into account the increase in population.

 Officials said Pawar has assured the Prime Minister he had enough stocks to feed the public distribution system, which sells grains to the poor and middle class at controlled prices. The agriculture minister has also told that he will have sufficient stocks of wheat for the ambitious food- for-work programmes launched by the Congress-led government. 

 However, dissatisfied with the agriculture ministrys assurance, the Prime Ministers Office is worried about the low stocks and a late monsoon, which together could place the countrys food security in jeopardy for the first time in about 14 years. 

 In fact, wheat prices in the country started moving up from May itself. The rates have shot up to Rs 7,600 a tonne from around Rs 7,200 in mid-May. Prices at the same time last year were only slightly higher than the government support price of Rs 6,400 a tonne.

 GE banking foray in two years

 New Delhi, March 2 (PTI): GE Consumer Finance, the global financial powerhouse, is planning a foray into retail banking in the next two years to expand its operations in India.

 ?We will roll out our retail banking operations in India in the next 24 months,? GE Consumer Finance president and CEO David R. Nissen said, adding the firm was in talks with the Reserve Bank of India for the banking licence.

 He declined to specify the amount GE will be investing in its new venture. Asked whether GE was scouting for banks in the country for expanding its operations, he said, ?It is too premature to comment. We have not decided on anything?.

 Elaborating on the company?s roadmap, he said, ?The business will be bifurcated and consumer finance and retail banking business will exist side by side.?

 The company has no plans to foray into insurance business at the moment.

 Talking about the budget proposals announced on Monday, he said it was favourable for consumer financing and retail banking business in the country. ?We are interested in investing in India to expand our business in all the segments we exist in and foray into new areas.?

 The company is expanding its branch network in India to 200 from the present 109 to increase its physical presence.

 GE Consumer Finance is into credit-card business in a big way. It has about 1.5 million cardholders in India and 10 co-branded cards.

 ?We are coming out with more co-branded credit cards in the next six months,? he said referring to the company?s goal of expanding the credit-card business in India.

 The business growth will be 2-3 times more in Asia, particularly India, he added.

 Emami to tap market

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 24: Emami Ltd has filed a prospectus with the Registrar of Companies, Bengal, for a public offering. The Calcutta-based FMCG company has fixed the price band at Rs 60-70 per share with a face value of Rs 2.

 Proceeds of the offering will be used for acquisitions at home and abroad, apart from capital expenditure. While the company has opted for a 100 per cent book-building method, the issue would constitute 50 lakh shares, which works out to 8.18 per cent of its fully diluted post-issue paid-up capital. 

 Emami will list the new shares on the Bombay Stock Exchange and Calcutta Stock Exchange. The post-issue paid-up capital of Emami will be Rs 12.23 crore.

 Emami chairman R. S. Agarwal said, ?We feel that with our strong brand franchise, we are in a good position to buy out competition or brands to grow our business rapidly.?

 Agarwal said the company will also invest in expanding the business in an organic manner. ?We feel that the price band is a good option for investors,? he added.

 Up to 10 per cent of the issue is reserved for employees, while up to 50 per cent of the net issue is set aside for qualified institutional buyers on a discretionary basis. Not less than 25 per cent of the net issue will be available for allocation on proportionate basis to non-institutional bidders of high net worth individuals (HNIs), while not less than 25 per cent of the net issue will be available on a proportionate basis to retail bidders.

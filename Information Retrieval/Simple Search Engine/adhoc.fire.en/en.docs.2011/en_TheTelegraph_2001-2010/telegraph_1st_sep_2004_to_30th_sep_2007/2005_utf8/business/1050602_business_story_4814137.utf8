 BPL stake scanner

 Chennai, June 1 (PTI): A report authenticating the records of BPLs three telecom ventures ? BPL Communications, BPL Mobile Communication and BPL Cellular ? controlled by Rajeev Chandrasekhar, has been submitted to the Company Law Board (CLB), Chennai.

 Following a petition by BPL group patriarch T. P. G. Nambiar against Chandrasekhar, the CLB additional principal bench had asked lawyer R. Venkatavaradhan last month to authenticate the records of the three BPL ventures.

 Ive authenticated the records and submitted the report to the Company Law Board yesterday, said Venkatavaradhan, who was made the advocate-commissioner for the authentication of records.

 The tussle over the control of BPLs telecom ventures between Nambiar and his son-in-law Chandrasekhar is lying before the Company Law Board. 

 Nambiar had alleged that he was sidelined from BPLs telecom business by Chandrasekhar. Nambiar, who had over 51 per cent stake in the telecom ventures, now holds only about 7 per cent.

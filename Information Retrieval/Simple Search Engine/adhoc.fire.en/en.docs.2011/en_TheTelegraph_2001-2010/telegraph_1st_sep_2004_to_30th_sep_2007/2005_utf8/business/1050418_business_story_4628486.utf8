 CPT pulls up errant tenants

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Grounded 

 Calcutta, April 17: The Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) has embarked on a move to realise unpaid rents from a large number of tenants who went scot-free for decades.

 There are about 5,500 tenants on CPT land that stretches from the city to outskirts. However, over 3,000 of them do not pay rent owing to disputes with the port.

 The CPT owns about 1,600 acres of encumbered land, while 150 acres are freehold. These exclude the area under port operations as well as the land at Haldia.

 The port has now taken up the cudgels against errant tenants and started serving them notices to pay up according to current rates as well as the arrears. 

 CPT chairman A. K. Chanda said the income from rent would go up substantially this year. 

 ?We have been able to send notices to about a few hundred tenants so far. The rest will be taken up this year. Following this, our cash flow will increase,? Chanda told The Telegraph.

 The effort spearheaded by the port authority has already started yielding results. Estate income has gone up from Rs 20-22 crore in 2003-04 to Rs 50 crore last financial year.

 Errant tenants used to evade rent by embroiling CPT in legal battle, and then using the pretext to suspend payment. Strangely, the port authority, with a marked lack of enthusiasm, pursued these cases.

 In some cases, CPT used to send eviction notices to these tenants asking them to vacate the premises after the term was over.

 The tenants moved court challenging the order and arranged matters so that the cases dragged on for a long time without any progress being made. During this period, the port did not receive any rent from them.

 ?The argument was that sending a rent bill means accepting them as tenants. However, we found out that during litigation, a damage/compensation bill can be sent,? Chanda said.

 The port sent a team to Mumbai, which also owns huge property, to study how it dealt with the issue.

 ?A tenant should not have relief of non-payment. However, for some reason CPT did not take action on the matter,? a port insider said.

 Sources said the involvement of a section of port officials could not be ruled out. 

 CPT is seeking rent from present date as well as asking for payments in arrears. 

 Port officials said they recognised the entire process would be an arduous task as there were vested interest acting against the move.

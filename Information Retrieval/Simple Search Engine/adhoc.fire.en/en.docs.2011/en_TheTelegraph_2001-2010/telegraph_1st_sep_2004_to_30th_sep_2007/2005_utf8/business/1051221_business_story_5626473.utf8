 AirTel broadband service in east soon

 Rajan Bharti Mittal: Fresh targets

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 20: AirTel will soon introduce wireless broadband technology in eastern India keeping in view the large-scale investment potential in the region.

 When we entered eastern India, the region was slow on all aspects of development. We were moving to a new zone where accessibility was low. But, in the last few years, Jharkhand and Orissa have come up fast and people who have no access to water and power are now demanding telecom connectivity. Thats a huge impact on the society. Its mind boggling, said Rajan Bharti Mittal, Bharti Tele-Ventures joint managing director while launching the BlackBerry services here on the eve of completing one-year of service in the state.

 Mittal said with eastern India attracting more and more industries, wireless broadband services would be in demand.

 The region has shown high telecom penetration in terms of investment proposals, especially from steel and aluminium industries. 

 Technology is changing a lot. Now the issue is not voice, but how to transmit data. It can either be transmitted through copper wires or wireless broadband. But the future surely lies with wireless broadband, he said.

 Mittal ruled out any immediate plans to enter overseas markets and said the company would concentrate on deeper penetration within the country, particularly in rural areas. In Orissa, teledensity is just about 5 per cent while the national average is about 11. So the state has to benchmark against the national average.

 He has urged the Centre and state governments to bring down the high tax structure. He said as and when the government reduces the tax, the benefits would be passed onto the consumers.

 AirTel launched its operations in Orissa in December 16 last year. Within a year it has registered three lakh customers. It is now second to BSNL, which has 3.9 lakh subscribers in Orissa.

 Mittal said AirTel has so far invested Rs 190 crore in the state and would pump in another Rs 60 crore by March 2006 and expand its operations from 300 to 400 towns. In November, it added 32,000 new subscribers, the highest by any operator in the circle.

 Through BlackBerry, AirTel subscribers can access various facilities like seamless connectivity and instant e-mail through mobile. Currently, the services will be available in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack.

 New Delhi, Jan. 19: Bharti TeleVentures will introduce a ?service guarantee? scheme that offers its customers STD/ISD pre-paid calling card worth Rs 100 if the company fails to rectify a dead phone or a bill with errors within eight hours of the complaint.

 A service guarantee, the company claims, is a first-of-its-kind scheme to provide error-free services with a motto: Services right the first time and every time. 

 The service guarantee scheme provided repair of any dead phones within eight working hours of receiving a complaint and error-free billing. The scheme is a culmination of AirTel?s efforts in continuously setting new benchmarks in quality by adhering to the best practices, including six-sigma.

 In the unlikely event of any failure in this promise, the company will give STD/ISD pre-paid calling card worth Rs 100 to customers.

 In addition, AirTel - Broadband and Telephone Services is planning to have a 250-seater call centre equipped with the best audio communication devices (ACDs), interactive voice response systems (IVRs) and call loggers to provide world-class after-sales support. It already has a dedicated 24-hour call centre. 

 The company will launch its broadband service in 15-20 cities in the next fiscal as part of the second phase of expansion of its broadband and basic telephone services across the country.

 The company kicked off the second phase by offering broadband in Uttar Pradesh. The subsequent rollouts are planned in Rajasthan, Punjab and Chandigarh in the north. The other states to be covered are Maharastra, Bengal and Kerala.

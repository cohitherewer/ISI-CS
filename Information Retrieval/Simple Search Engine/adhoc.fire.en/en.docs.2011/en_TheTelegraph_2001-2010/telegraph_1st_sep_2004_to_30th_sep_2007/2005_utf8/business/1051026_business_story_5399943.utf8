 Huawei in local ally hunt

 Shenzhen, Oct. 25: Huawei Technologies Company Ltd, the Chinese telecom equipment maker, is looking for new partners in India to bid for a 60-million-telephone-line tender that Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) will shortly float.

 Huawei is hoping that its recent troubles surrounding an unfulfilled BSNL contract will not bar it from bidding for the new contract.

 The Chinese telecom equipment maker ran into trouble after reneging on a tender that it won from the state-owned telephony major in May. BSNL has since issued a showcause notice to the Chinese telecom company and has threatened to bar it from all future business dealings.

 The tender that Huawei won in May was for the installation of 1.05 million telephone lines based on the code division multiple access (CDMA) technology, which it won along with its Indian partners ? Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd (HFCL) and Semiconductors India Ltd.

 The new tender is based on the global system from mobile communications (GSM) standard.

 HFCL and Semiconductors India will not be participating in the new tender since both of them specialise in implementing projects based on CDMA technology.

 HFCL chief Mahendra Nahata said, quot;Since our focus is on installing equipment based on code division multiple accesses (CDMA) technology, we will not be pitching for the 60 million lines tender with any equipment supplier. quot;

 The controversy over the BSNL contract has sparked recriminations among the partners with Huawei blaming HFCL and Semiconductors India Ltd for failing to renegotiate the contract to implement the 1.05-million-line order from BSNL.

 We have never gone back on our deal. I am still ready to implement it provided they (Huawei) supply the equipment. I am willing to go much beyond the contract and open a letter of credit. I am at loss to understand why they are not responding in spite of my repeated attempts to secure the supply of equipment, said Nahata.

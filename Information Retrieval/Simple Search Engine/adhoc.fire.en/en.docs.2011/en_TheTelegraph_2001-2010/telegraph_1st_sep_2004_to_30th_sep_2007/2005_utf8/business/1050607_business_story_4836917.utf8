 Raman Roy quits Wipro, Kurien takes over

 New Delhi, June 6 (PTI): T. K. Kurien was today appointed as the chief of Wipro Spectramind ? Wipros BPO venture ? replacing Raman Roy, who has resigned from the company to pursue interests of his own after a three-year stint.

 We are pleased to have Kurien lead our BPO initiative at a time when it is at an inflexion point, Wipro vice-chairman Vivek Paul said.

 Given his wide experience in technology and process optimisation and his excellent track record as a leader, Kurien has the right combination of experience and energy to sustain and leverage our position of leadership in BPO. He will help us broaden our offerings and further realise the emerging opportunities in this space, Paul said.

 On his new role, Kurien said: We hope to take Wipro BPO to the next level through a combination of tighter alignment with our vertical solutions, leveraging our pool of domain expertise and increased optimisation and standardisation of processes and technologies.

 Prior to this assignment, Kurien was part of Wipros BPO business, driving the transaction processing business initiative. 

 He has handled many successful assignments, including launch of systems integration practice, culminating in the $70 million systems integration order from a UK-based telecom service provider.

 Kurien also had a successful stint as the CFO of Wipro GE Medical Systems.

 NTPC ups generation target

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 24: The National Thermal Power Corporation has revised upwards its capacity addition programme from 56,000 megawatt to 66,000 mw by 2017, chairman and managing director C.P. Jain told the annual general meeting on Friday. 

 The company has increased its target for the 11th plan period from 11,500 mw to 17,000 mw. It is already identifying 20,000-mw projects for the 12th plan (2012 -2017) period.

 ?Encouraged by the success of our capacity addition programmes in the 10th plan period and higher cash flow, we have decided to increase our 11th plan targets. We have already started identifying projects of 20,000-mw capacity to be implemented in the 12th plan,? Jain said.

 The company would give a special thrust to achieve operational and commercial synergy in hydropower. NTPC is also planning to substantially increase the ratio of hydro projects, he said. 

 He also pointed out that within a strategic framework of achieving planned capacity addition, NTPC has continuously tried to reduce the cost and time of project construction. It plans to commission 500 mw power units within 38 months and 660 mw units within 44 months.

 In order to ensure sustained fuel supply for its projects, NTPC will participate in the entire energy value chain of coal mining, gas exploration and liquefied natural gas terminal. ?To start with, the company will integrate coal mining with power projects to enhance fuel security and mitigate risks.?

 NTPC has been allotted one coal-mining block and has applied for a few more. It is identifying coal pithead based integrated power projects where the company will draw coal from its own mines.

 It plans to acquire parallel distribution licences in areas surrounding the projects, while it is targeting to substantially increase the power trading volumes.

 NTPC is also setting up a state-of-the art national power exchange to facilitate power trading in the country. 

 ?All our forward and backward integration initiatives are primarily aimed at strengthening the core business of power generation. Assured availability of coal and gas is key to the company?s success, its long-term sustainability and competitiveness,? Jain said.

 ?With a 24.15 per cent growth in net profit during the first quarter, we have begun the financial year on a strong note,? he added.

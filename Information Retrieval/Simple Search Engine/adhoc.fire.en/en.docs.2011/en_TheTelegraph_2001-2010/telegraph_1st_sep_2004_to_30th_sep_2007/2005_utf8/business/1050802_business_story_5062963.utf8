 Sebi norms on gold exchange fund soon

 New Delhi, Aug. 1 (PTI): The Securities and Exchange Board of India will soon issue guidelines for allowing mutual funds to launch gold exchange traded funds (GETF).

 An internal committee headed by Sebi member Madhukar is giving final touches to the guidelines that would enable an investor to convert gold ornaments into tradeable mutual fund units and get a return on it.

 We will come out with the guidelines on gold ETF shortly, a senior Sebi official said.

 Some mutual funds like UTI AMC are waiting for the regulations to launch the gold ETF. UTI AMC is ready with the basic structure of the scheme.

 This will help an individual get a capital appreciation from the gold assets even if the price of the yellow metal fall over a period of time.

 GETF units, which can also be bought by pledging gold ornaments or paying cash, will give an opportunity to the investor to convert the units into gold. 

 Mutual funds have to tie up with banks who would act as custodians for exchanging gold ornaments into units of gold ETF. The bank will have to carry out the valuation of ornaments and provide GETF units for equivalent amount.

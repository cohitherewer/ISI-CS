 Cabinet to discuss oil PSU losses

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today said the cabinet will take up the issue of the huge losses suffered by Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum when it meets next. The bottomlines of the companies have taken a hit because of a price freeze on petroleum products despite soaring international crude rates.

 The petroleum ministry has brought the relevant data to the notice of the Prime Ministers office and the finance ministry and the situation is being constantly reviewed, the minister said.

 We are concerned about the companies. These losses were anticipated. We knew the companies would take a hit when we found that no price revision was possible throughout the months of April and May and nearly three weeks in June, Aiyar added.

 But we are more worried to find that even after the price revisions, these companies appear to suffer losses and are facing difficulties in meeting their investment targets for capital expenditures, he said.

 Asked whether the prices of petroleum goods would be raised to avoid these losses, he said, Pricing is a politico-economic question that involves the entire cabinet.

 Aiyar said the role of the petroleum ministry is to bring the facts to the attention of the cabinet as a whole under the stewardship of the Prime Minister. 

 I will make certain suggestions but they will be considered in tandem with a variety of issues that go into petroleum pricing, he added.

 Regarding Indian Oil Corporations chairmans statement that he would have to review the investment plans of the company, Aiyar said, I have brought that fact to the attention of the finance minister and the PMO.

 Refiners Indian Oil Corporation and Bharat Petroleum have suffered their first-ever quarterly losses, struggling due to the government caps on product prices while crude rates have soared.

 The government had allowed a 7 per cent rise in petrol and diesel prices on June 20 after no revision in April and May.

 Bongaigaon Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, which is an Indian Oil subsidiary, has reported a 48 per cent fall in its net profit to Rs 68.80 crore.

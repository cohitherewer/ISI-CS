 Tata Steel to set up pellet plant

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 20: Tata Steel will set up a pellet plant in Jharkhand/Orissa to cater to its domestic operations and the proposed Bangladesh plant.

 Deputy managing director (steel) T. Mukherjee said the pellet plant would be set up close to the mines.

 We are yet to finalise the capacity or investment required for the plant, he added.

 However, Mukherjee confirmed that the capacity would be over 10-12 million tonnes (mt).

 Generally, a 5-mt capacity requires an investment of Rs 300-400 crore. Going by that, the company might need to pump in well over Rs 1,000 crore.

 Bangladesh has abundant natural gas to fire the plant, but it lacks iron ore. To feed the 2.4-mt plant there, the company needs to export ore from India.

 However, Orissa and Jharkhand are against export of iron ore.

 Both Posco and Mittal Steel had to drop the export clause of iron ore. As a compromise formula, states are asking value addition to be done within their territories. The pellet plant could be a step in that direction.

 Due diligence was on for acquisitions in Southeast Asia, Mukherjee said at a metal seminar organised by Metal Bulleting and metaljunction here today.

 The acquisition will be done through NatSteel, Singapore, which is now a 100 per cent subsidiary of Tata Steel, he said.

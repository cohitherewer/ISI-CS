 Mico eyes big orders from car majors

 Wuzburg (Germany), June 13 (PTI): As it prepares to manufacture common rail diesel injection (CRDI) systems in India from 2006, German automotive component giant Bosch is eyeing big ticket orders in the passenger car market, targeting the Tatas as well as Maruti, which is coming up with its diesel engine plant at Gurgaon in Haryana.

 We are talking to all the companies, said Albert Hieronimus, head of Boschs Indian subsidiary Mico. Bosch holds about 60 per cent share in Mico. 

 He said the diesel car market in India was going up and the company is bullish on the prospects of the common rail diesel injection systems as well as its existing fuel injection equipment.

 Today, diesel versions accounts for about 50-51 per cent share of the total four-wheeler sales in India. While it is 100 per cent in commercial vehicles, in multi-utility and sports-utility vehicles the figure is around 80 per cent. In passenger cars, where diesel is around 20 per cent now, we feel there will be high growth in the coming years, Hieronimus said.

 The Mico chief expects the share of diesel-run cars to almost double to 40 per cent in the next few years. The fastest-growing segment is the mid-size segment. In the compact car segment, we expect to sell our existing as well as the rail injection systems, which will become cost-effective as and when local manufacturing commences, he added. 

 Founded in 1951, Mico is a market leader in diesel fuel injection equipment and spark plugs.

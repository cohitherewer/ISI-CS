 Milan/Munich, June 13 (Reuters): Italys UniCredito and HVB Group of Germany have agreed to proceed with Europes biggest-ever cross-border banking takeover.

 This is a significant day for HVB and UniCredito, HVB chief Dieter Rampl said after his banks supervisory board approved the deal to form Europes ninth-biggest bank. We are creating the first truly European bank.

 In Milan, UniCredito executive Alessandro Profumo confirmed the board of the Italian lender had also agreed to the deal. Neither Rampl nor Profumo commented on details of the agreement.

 On Saturday, sources familiar with the situation said the all-share deal would value HVB at over 15 billion euros ($18.35 billion), making it bigger than the 2004 acquisition by Spains Santander Central Hispano of Abbey National in Britain.

 The takeover will give UniCredito market leadership in central Europe via HVBs Vienna-listed Bank Austria Creditanstalt, a retail network in Bavaria and northern Germany, HVBs corporate and real-estate loan book and Activest fund arm.

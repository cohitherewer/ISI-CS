 Aiyar balm for PSU oil retailers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Aiyar: Plainspeak

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: With cash losses of Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum and IBP shooting up to Rs 1,516 crore during July, the government is likely to ask ONGC, OIL and Gail to shell out more to offset a greater portion of these losses. 

 It may also consider other options, including hike in fuel prices and cut in customs and excise duties on crude and petro goods. 

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today told the upper house that ONGC, OIL and Gail have already contributed Rs 1,156 crore to downstream companies during the April-June quarter, which constituted one-third of the subsidy burden. 

 The ministry of petroleum and natural gas is now trying to see what kind of contribution upstream oil companies can make to offset, or at least, minimise the losses being suffered by marketing companies, Aiyar said. 

 He also said the government would consider a further cut in customs and excise duties on crude and petroleum products to cushion consumers from the impact of international oil price rally. We have brought down customs duty on petrol and diesel to one-third of what was prevailing when the NDA government was in power. We will see what can be done further.

 The customs and excise duties on LPG and kerosene have been brought down to zero, Aiyar said. However, while bringing down excise on other products, the revenue implications will have to be kept in mind, he added.

 Four oil marketing companies have suffered a net loss of Rs 1,227 crore in the first quarter of this fiscal, even after raising the prices of petrol and diesel on June 21. Crude prices have been hovering at $6 per barrel since then. 

 Aiyar said about 76 per cent of Indias crude requirement is imported. As a result, there is no way to control the cost of production when international prices escalate. 

 The new and disturbing trend is that our navratna and mini-ratna oil firms are beginning to suffer net or cash losses, seriously incapacitating their abilities to meet capital expenditure targets or maintain dividends on equity.

 During April to June, under-recovery of oil firms from petrol and diesel was put at Rs 4,900 crore and on kerosene and LPG at Rs 4,800 crore. During 2005-06, the under-recoveries may exceed Rs 40,000 crore, if the current price trend continues, he said. 

 Between May 2004 and March, the government has taken a hit of Rs 4,000 crore by bringing down the excise and customs duties.

 At the start of the year, petroleum and finance ministries had projected the revenues to be generated by the petroleum sector. Crude prices have gone up faster than anticipated. However, it is early to quantify its impact on revenues, he said.

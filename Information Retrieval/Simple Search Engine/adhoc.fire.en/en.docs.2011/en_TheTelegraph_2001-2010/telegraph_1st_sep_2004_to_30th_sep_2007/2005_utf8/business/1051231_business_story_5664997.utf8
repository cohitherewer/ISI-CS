 New Delhi, Dec. 30: The government today came out with the blueprint of a Rs 95,000-crore long-term National Maritime Development Programme (NMDP) to develop the sector through a mix of budgetary support, public-private partnership and FDI.

 Shipping minister T.R. Baalu said the two-phased programme aims at focused and accelerated investment in specific projects such as port infrastructure, tonnage acquisition and institutional capacity-building projects, to be taken up for over a period of up to 2011-12. The programme comprises 387 projects covering the entire gamut of activities that need to be undertaken to ensure that the maritime sector positions itself to meet the challenges arising from Indias emerging global aspirations, he said.

 Baalu said phase-I of the programme would comprise ongoing and new projects to be completed by 2006-07 while phase-II would envisage projects to be completed during 2007-08 to 2024-25, which will be co-terminus with the maritime policy.

 The estimated investment for the port sector will be Rs 31,971 crore during the first phase. Of this, Rs 1,350 crore will come from budgetary support while Rs 8,991 crore is expected to be raised by the major ports from their internal resources. Private investment during this phase will be Rs 19,112 crore while the balance of Rs 2518 crore is expected to come from the National Highways Authority of India, Railways and other organisations. 

 Major projects include container terminals at the Jawaharlal Nehru port, Cochin, Kandla, Chennai, and Ennore, two offshore container berths at the Mumbai port and coal and iron ore berths at Paradip.

 The minister also hinted at the likely government approval for acquiring 76 vessels for the Shipping Corporation of India and very large crude carriers and LNG vessels for the port sector. A total investment of Rs 15,000 crore will be required for the acquisition of these vessels till 2024-2025.

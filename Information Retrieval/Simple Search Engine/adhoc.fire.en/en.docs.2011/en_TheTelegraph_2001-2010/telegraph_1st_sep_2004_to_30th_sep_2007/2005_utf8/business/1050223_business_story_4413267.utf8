 Mallya throws offer gauntlet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 22: The bidding war for Shaw Wallace gets curiouser and curiouser. Vidya Chhabria, widow of the late Manu Chhabria, has been stalling the sale of the family?s stake to Vijay Mallya. After Mallya came up with the largest bid for the spirits division of Shaw Wallace late last year, the recriminations have started to fly between the two camps. 

 Mallya accuses the Chhabrias of breaking the rules of the game. He claims that they had initially sought bids for only the spirits division of Shaw Wallace but are now offering their entire 55 per cent in the company, which runs other businesses, including gelatines and agrochemicals.

 The liquor baron says the bidders will have to get an estimate of their entire assets and liabilities before making fresh bids. 

 The announcement of the successful bidder was supposed to have been made by the middle of January. Mallya has learnt unofficially that his bid was the highest. Mallya is clearly wary that the dithering by Chhabrias could once again wreck his opportunity of acquiring Shaw Wallace ? a company he first stalked with Manu Chhabria close to 20 years ago.

 The open offer is seen as a pre-emptive move as anybody who is keen to acquire Shaw Wallace will have to contend with the UB group, not only in the marketplace but also in the board room.

 ?It reflects the highest degree of transparency and corporate governance as we do not intend to exclude the other shareholders of Shaw Wallace from the process,? Mallya said.

 Asked if he felt there was a contractual obligation on the Chhabrias to sell to him, Mallya bristled: ?Certainly there is an implied obligation, otherwise why ask for bids?? He said the Chhabrias had tried to keep him out of the bidding process. 

 The Chhabria camp sees Mallya?s open offer as a hostile bid and have also started firing broadsides at him. ?Mr Mallya?s stand on the issue has been changing rather rapidly. He had recently made a statement about launching a hostile bid against Shaw Wallace to a leading national daily and then withdrew his statement a few days later,? said a senior SWC official.

 ?The bidding process mandated exploring strategic alternatives for the liquor business. The process has not crystallised yet. Mallya is one of the participants and, in that context, his action is incomprehensible. Further, his action runs contrary to the very spirit of the settlement with Jumbo Group on all outstanding issues less than a year ago,? the SWC official said.

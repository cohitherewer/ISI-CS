The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Harrisons agog with deal whispers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 14: Expect an announcement from the RP Goenka group tomorrow.

 It is likely that the company involved in the announcement will be Harrisons Malayalam, which is in the plantations business, because a board meeting has been called tomorrow.

 And it could be an acquisition or a sale. The market believes it will be a sale. It also believes the deal will be on Harrisons tea business. The company also owns rubber plantations.

 Chairman Sanjiv Goenka refused comment. Earlier in the morning he said at a news conference: There will be an announcement tomorrow. The announcement may be on some acquisition or sale.

 The buzz in the corridors of CESC House in Calcutta is that the tea estates ? in south India ? will be sold as the business is not doing too well.

 Sources said most RPG group companies had turned around and efforts were going on in respect of Harrisons also, south Indias second largest tea plantation company. 

 On 13 estates covering 6,000 hectares of planted area, the company produces 18 million kg of tea a year. The estates are located in the high ranges of Kerala and Tamil Nadu.

 The south Indian tea industry has been suffering from low price realisation for more than four years. Many companies have exited the business and have even converted some tea gardens into spice plantations.

 Tea industry officials said the sale price of south Indian tea is around Rs 75-80 a kg. For gardens with good quality tea, the price can at best be Rs 100 a kg, one of them said.

 Garden valuation is based on the price that every kg of tea produced there fetches in the market.

 HML is also the industry leader in natural rubber production. It has 13 estates with a planted area of over 9,000 hectares. These are located in prime rubber-growing areas of the country. The firm is the countrys largest supplier of quality natural rubber. 

 HML has been one of the leading exporters of tea from south India for nearly a century.

 The company has a subsidiary, Sentinel Tea and Exports Ltd, which exclusively undertakes all export contracts for the company. HML has been shipping tea to almost all countries. Big names in the UK, Russia, Poland, Egypt, Iraq and other West Asian countries are among its clients.

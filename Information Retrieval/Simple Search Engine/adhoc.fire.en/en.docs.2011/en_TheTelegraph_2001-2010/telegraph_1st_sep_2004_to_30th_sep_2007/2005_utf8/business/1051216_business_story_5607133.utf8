 Glenmark inks pact with US drug firm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 15: Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd has partnered with InvaGen Pharmaceuticals Inc to develop and market seven generic pharmaceutical products in the US. 

 The products include a mix of off-patent and patent-protected molecules with a cumulative annual sales of about $4.1 billion in that country. 

 Under the deal, InvaGen will develop and licence to Glenmark seven generic products. InvaGen will also file for Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs), while Glenmark will obtain the regulatory approval in the US market. 

 Following the approval, Glenmarks US subsidiary, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc, will exclusively market the products, while InvaGen will manufacture and supply them. All development and regulatory costs as well as profits on sale in the US will be shared equally between the partners. 

 According to Glenmark, one ANDA has already been filed and three more are expected to be filed by March next year.

 Glenmark Pharmaceuticals CEO and MD Glenn Saldanha said, We are keen to deepen our association with InvaGen. The deal is in line with the companys multi-pronged approach to strengthen our presence as a serious generics player in the US.

 InvaGen president Sudhakar R. Vidiyala said, InvaGen is excited to expand the relationship with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Inc, USA, as our marketing partner. We believe this relationship will benefit from the individual complementary strengths of the two companies.

 InvaGen is a US generic pharmaceutical company based in Long Island, New York, and is vertically integrated with a leading active pharmaceutical manufacturer in India.

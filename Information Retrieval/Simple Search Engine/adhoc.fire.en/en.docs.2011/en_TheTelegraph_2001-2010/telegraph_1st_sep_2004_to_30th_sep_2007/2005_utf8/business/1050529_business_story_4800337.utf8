 Computer Associates to restate results

 New York, May 28 (Reuters): Software maker Computer Associates International will rewrite its annual financial statements brought out in the last five years. The company ha s found 10 improper contracts getting entries in those reports. Only last year, the company made a $2.2-billion restatement. 

 The company also posted a lower quarterly net income due to a tax charge associated with shifting profits back to the United States. 

 Citing a change in expenses accounting, the company guided its full-year profit to be lower than analysts estimates. 

 Analysts said Computer Associates is having a difficult time growing its core business of system management, which has been on the decline over the past few years. 

 A new management team is need to turn around the ship, Nitsan Hargil, an analyst with Friedman Billings Ramsey said. But its such a large and heavy ship that it would take years to change the course. 

 Computer Associates, which emerged from a long-running accounting scandal last year, said it may defer the filing of its annual report by 15 days. 

 I think all companies have findings and we do have deficiencies, chief financial officer Bob Davis said. 

 Several technology companies have opted for a filing extension this year due to more stringent US compliance and financial reporting rules. 

 But Hargil said it is troubling because Computer Associates has plenty of time as its quarter finished almost two months ago. Hargil also called the restatements surprising. 

 I thought that they would have corrected it in the first time, quot; Hargil said. 

 In some cases, the company found it had entered into swap deals with third parties who have no valid commercial purposes. Certain licence agreements were even altered by side agreements that would have prevented the full recognition of revenues until some future point, resulting in early booking of revenues. 

 The restatements will reduce its revenue by $80 million to $110 million and net income by $15 mn to $25 mn.

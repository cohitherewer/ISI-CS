 Overseas fund flows still a trickle

 The more, the merrier 

 New Delhi, Jan. 30: India is at the bottom of the league table for foreign direct investment.

 At a time when the government is keen to ratchet up FDI flows to over $10 billion from current levels of a little over $4 billion, a study by Assocham shows that FDI inflows into the country as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) is a woeful 0.8 per cent.

 At the top of the pecking order ? using the FDI to GDP ratio ? is Hong Kong with 16.8 per cent followed by Singapore with an impressive 12.2 per cent.

 The analysis shows China has a ratio of 4.3 per cent with Britain at 4.7 per cent. Others on the list include Brazil (4 per cent), Thailand (3.7 per cent), Mexico (3 per cent), the Philippines (1.8 per cent).

 ?India was at the bottom of the table with 0.8 per cent at the end of November 2004,? the study said.

 This is, however, sad considering that successive governments in India have continuously made efforts to revamp various policy decisions to attract higher inflows. 

 ?Our analysis builds a strong case for reviewing the FDI caps on important sectors like telecom, aviation and insurance,? said Mahendra K. Sanghi, president, Assocham. 

 Interestingly, the study states that the FDI-GDP ratio for the US stood at 1.8 per cent.

 The top five sectors receiving FDI in India are electrical equipment getting $373 million (accounting for 18 per cent of the total FDI inflow), drugs and pharmaceuticals $286 million (14.43 per cent), consultancy services $214 million (10.76 per cent), fuel, including power and oil, $190 million (9.55 per cent) and metallurgy $164 million (8.27 per cent).

 Given India?s size, the quantum of FDI inflows falls well short of its potential. This is despite the fact that foreign investment is allowed freely in almost all sectors, including services. 

 Mauritius emerged as the number one investing country, reflecting the preference for the taxation treaty.

 Inflows from Mauritius were $626 million, accounting for 34 per cent of the total FDI funds, followed by the US with $19.11 million (accounting for 19.11 per cent). The Netherlands was at number three position followed by Germany and Japan. 

 The chamber has identified emerging opportunities in agriculture and allied sectors, food processing and packaging, contract farming and retailing, besides telecom, insurance and civil aviation with increased FDI cap. 

 The study calls for effective policy measures to invite foreign investment in the infrastructure sector, particularly roads, airports, seaports and civil aviation.

 Six years, $1.6 bn, Warburg wins big

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 28: Warburg Pincus had invested $300 million in Bharti Tele-Ventures between 1999 and 2001 to pick up an 18.52 per cent stake.

 In 1999, when Warburg first invested, the local mobile company had only 1,04,000 subscribers. When it exited completely today, Bharti has signed up 22 per cent of Indias 6.5-crore mobile users.

 Warburg Pincus had the foresight to invest in the company before the IPO in 2002 at prices that averaged less than Rs 52 per share. With todays final stake divestment, Warburg has reaped a total profit of about $1.6 billion on its original $300 million investment. In a presentation on the investment story in India to the prestigious Wharton Business School, which was made before it finally sold its remaining 5.6 per cent stake in Bharti, Warburg Pincus senior officials claimed that it had already made a profit of $800 million.

 With todays sale netting it Rs 3752 crore ($840 million), Warburg would easily be the envy of all private equity investors, though many shrug it off as the beginners luck and a one off return. Warburg has been selling its shares in Bharti Tele-Ventures in doses, at prices starting from Rs 155 per share.

 In March, Warburg had sold $560 million stake in Bharti Tele which took 28 minutes to be consummated on the BSE. The transaction was the largest of a series of divestment done by Warburg that saw the bulge bracket private equity investor pare its 18.5 per cent holding in Bharti to about 6 per cent.

 Its India story is a phenomenal one having generated returns in the mid-30s over 10 years, the firms co-president, Charles R. Kaye had said during a presentation on October 11 organised by the University of Pennsylvanias Center for the advanced study of India. 

 While Warburg has made rich pickings from Bharti, so did Bhartis entrepreneurial chairman Sunil Mittal and his family, which sold a small part of its 4.4 per cent stake to Vodafone. They had picked up the shares at one-fifth the price that Warburg had coughed up.

 Earlier this year, Mittal had sold his entire personal stake held under his name for Rs 68 crore. The promoters still control 46 per cent.

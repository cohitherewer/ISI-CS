 Bengal industry spearhead hugs stock market

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Sen: Change is in the air

 Calcutta, Sept. 15: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has made it known that he relishes foreign investment. His market-shunning comrades in the government are smacking their lips too, as they cream off succulent stock gains.

 Just how much Communist taste-buds have changed in Bengal can be seen at West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC), whose beady-eyed executives are riveted to every twitch and twirl on Dalal Street.

 The focus of their attention is on stocks of companies where the state government-promoted agency has poured money as one of the key promoters or investor. The mavens are not just watching; they are selling, too.

 ?As the scrip prices go up, we will divest our holding. WBIDC is a promotional agency for industries and there is no need to hold on to the stakes. If we get good prices, we are open to the idea of divesting. We have already done so in some companies for a profit,? says Bengal commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen.

 In the recent past, the corporation has palmed off shares in Tata Metaliks, Century Extrusion, Nicco Corporation, Consolidated Fibres and Pacific Cotspin. The stake sales in 12 firms have fetched WBIDC, whose holdings varied from 2 per cent to 5 per cent, around Rs 20 crore.

 WBIDC does not engage a merchant banker to guide it. An internal committee tracks the stock price and then decides whether it should go ahead with the stake sale.

 WBIDC has shovelled Rs 45 crore into equity but its largest slice of investment is in Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL), where its 36.87 per cent holding is worth Rs 540 crore.

 The government had asked for a premium of nearly Rs 20 on a face value of Rs 10 from The Chatterjee Group chief Purnendu Chatterjee for selling its stake in HPL. WBIDC would have got Rs 1560 crore, if the deal went through.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Six on the trot for market

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 9: Automobile, infotech and capital goods firms stole the show in another stock sizzler today, propelling the sensex to 6481.35 in a jump of 92.87 points.

 Such was the force of the rally that the 30-share index overcame bouts of selling at the 6450-mark. Local funds and operators, who helped the market to its sixth straight day of gains, scooped up infotech shares. Auto and capital goods revved up too, their shares among the big gainers. The BSE-100 index shot up 44.41 points to 3483.87.

 Fresh Sebi figures showed that mutual funds bought shares worth Rs 367.18 crore in the week ended May 6, while foreign funds were net sellers to the tune of Rs 36.6 crore.

 Small-cap shares were also a big draw, being chased by retail investors who see a lot of promise in them at this point. This was mirrored in the BSE-small cap index, which shot up by 171.75 points to finish at 4029.89. 

 The volume of business was Rs 1,896.28 crore, down from Rs 2,047.06 crore on Friday. IVRL Infrastructure was the turnover-topper with a tally of Rs 115.20 crore, followed by Reliance (Rs 78.34 crore), Tata Steel (Rs 63.27 crore), Satyam (Rs 61.03 crore) and Maruti (Rs 55.97 crore).

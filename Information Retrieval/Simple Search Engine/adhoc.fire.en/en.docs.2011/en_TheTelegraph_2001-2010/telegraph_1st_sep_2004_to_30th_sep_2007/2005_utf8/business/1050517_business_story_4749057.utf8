 Punjab Bank bid to become the best 

 New Delhi, May 16 (PTI): Punjab National Bank (PNB) has chalked out a five-pronged strategy for improving its financial position to become the best bank in the country.

 These include, reduction in costs of deposit, credit expansion, reduce gross non-performing assets (NPAs), improve asset-liability management and create more promotional opportunities for the staff in coming years, PNB chairman S.C. Gupta said. 

 After his successful stint at Indian Overseas Bank, Gupta took charge of PNB this month and charted out the future roadmap that aims at a growth in business by at least 20 per cent to over Rs 2,00,000 crore this fiscal.

 The first priority of the bank will be to reduce its cost of funds to 4-4.25 per cent from the present 4.6 per cent. Though the mix of deposits is good, we want to increase the share of demand deposits from 46 per cent to 48 per cent and reduce the proportion of time deposits from 54 to 52 per cent, he said. PNB would focus on semi-urban and rural areas for growth in time deposits and improve its net interest margins.

 PNB is also aiming to expand credit to retail, agriculture, trade and corporate sectors. The bank intends to allocate more funds for retail lending rather than give short term commercial loans at below the prime lending rates, Gupta said. Although PNB has almost wiped out net NPAs, Gupta said the bank would not be complacent and would aim at cutting gross NPAs. The banks gross NPA now stands at 5.86 per cent.

 With these measures, PNB will improve its asset-liability management and attain 50 per cent of budgeted goals in the first half of the fiscal so that the pressure in meeting the targets is less in the later half.

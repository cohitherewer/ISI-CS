 Calcutta, Feb. 24: Haldia Petrochemicals Limited (HPL) is drawing up plans to set up a second naphtha cracker unit in Haldia. 

 The Rs 5,170-crore petrochem company has formed a small in-house team last year to look into the possibility of setting up another unit. 

 Talking to The Telegraph, HPL chief executive officer Swapan Bhowmik said: ?The plan for the second unit is under consideration. The team is working on it. We always felt there is a need to enhance capacity. Now that the financials have improved we have put our heads together to find out the feasibility of the second unit.?

 The second unit will need an investment of Rs 2,000 crore. If the associated plants ? high-density polyethylene, low density polyethylene, polypropylene ? are also set up, then the total investments will shoot up to Rs 7,000 crore.

 The present capacity of the unit is 5.2 lakh tonnes per annum. ?We plan to double the present capacity,? added Bhowmik. 

 HPL has taken up a revamp programme. 

 Once HPL is able to complete the Rs 700-crore revamp operations it will not only lead to production of 6.7 lakh tonnes of ethylene but will also make the second cracker a distinct possibility, he said. The revamp is on schedule. 

 To take the company forward beyond 2006 ? the revamp would be over by October ? the management has started exploring the possibility of setting up another naphtha cracker unit. 

 Bhowmik said the company already has the land needed for such a project in Haldia.

 Finances, according to him, will not be a major constraint. ?We have not yet put the proposal before the lenders. But funds will not be a problem. The financials of the company are improving and the lenders are quite satisfied.?

 The company expects to achieve a net profit of Rs 750 crore in the current fiscal and a profit before tax of Rs 900-950 crore. It is also planning an initial public offer in the first quarter of 2005-06.

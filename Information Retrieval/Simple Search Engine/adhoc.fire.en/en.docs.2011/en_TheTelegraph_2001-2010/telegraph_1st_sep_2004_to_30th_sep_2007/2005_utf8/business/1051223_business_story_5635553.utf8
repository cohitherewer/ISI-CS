 Loan lifeline for sugar factories

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 22: The government will soon decide on restructuring the loans taken by sick sugar mills from the Sugar Development Fund in order to make them viable.

 The government is also in favour of complete decontrol of the sugar sector, but refused to set a timeframe for this.

 In a major relief to the sector, sugar produced from imports under the advance licence scheme would be exempted from the compulsory levy of quota obligations, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar told the 71st annual general meeting of the Indian Sugar Mills Association here.

 The government will also revive the system of maintaining a buffer stock of the commodity up to 4 million tonnes from the new sugar year, which began on October 1.

 The overall situation of the sugar industry has substantially improved, after many years of financial crisis, Pawar said.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram said Nabard has been asked to restructure the loans taken by private sugar mills through the corporate debt restructuring route. So far, 16 factories have got their loans restructured and at present no case was pending with the banks.

 Co-operative sugar mills can also avail of the debt-restructuring scheme, Chidambaram said. The restructuring package includes subvention of about Rs 560 crore.

 Chidambaram said loans would be available to all co-operative mills financed by the urban co-operative bodies for restructuring.

 Both Chidambaram and Pawar favoured decontrol of the sugar industry.

 Sony readies rejig plan

 Reaching out

 Tokyo, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Japan?s Sony Corp said on Monday it would unveil a long-awaited restructuring plan on September 22, aimed at turning around the struggling electronics and entertainment giant.

 Sony, maker of Vaio PCs and PlayStation game machines, had said it would announce a new strategy in late September to reallocate resources, suggesting it would look to trim its product line-up or downsize poorly performing businesses. Chief executive Howard Stringer, the first foreigner at the helm of the Japanese electronics conglomerate, president Ryoji Chubachi and chief financial officer Nobuyuki Oneda are scheduled to attend the meeting. Welsh-born Stringer and Chubachi are faced with the formidable challenge of reviving Sony?s core electronics division, which has been in the red for the past two business years amid intense price competition.

 Sony is in the last year of a three-year restructuring plan that aims to slash 330 billion yen in fixed costs, mainly by cutting thousands of jobs in its electronics division.

 But many industry analysts have said Sony would need to take more drastic measures to remain competitive with strong domestic rivals such as Sharp Corp and a growing number of low-cost Asian manufacturers producing cheap electronics.

 One area in need of repair is Sony?s television unit, which lost 25.7 billion yen on an operating basis in the past business year on weak sales of traditional cathode ray tube sets and sinking prices of liquid crystal display models.

 The inventor of the Walkman is also trying to regain its footing in the portable music player market where it has been outmanoeuvred by Apple Computer Inc and its popular iPod device and iTunes online music store. 

 Analysts said restructuring steps with little surprise could push Sony shares down.

 Dabhol solution in sight

 Power point

 Mumbai, Jan. 15 (PTI): The Union government today said that a ?solution was in sight? for the restart of the troubled Dabhol power project and it would be a win-win situation for all the parties concerned.

 ?With every meeting of the group of ministers formed for solving the issue we are advancing towards the solution,? Union power minister P. M. Sayeed told reporters here but did not give any timeframe for the restart.

 The solution for Dabhol would be a win-win situation for all concerned and benefit Maharashtra, which is reeling under power shortage of more than 2,500 MW, he said.

 The first phase of about 740 MW would be first restarted followed by the second phase of 1,444 MW, whose 90 per cent work has been completed, the minister said.

 Gail and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) are assisting the lenders at this stage to restart the project, he said.

 NTPC and Gail would take care of operating the plant and the LNG terminal, respectively, he said adding, there was no talk of these two companies taking over the ownership of Dabhol.

 Sayeed said the Dabhol plant was in good shape and the preservation of the assets was under a contract. 

 In another development, the government has selected three members for the proposed appellate tribunal for electricity and the selection of the chairman would be made in two weeks.

 Electricity act

 The Centre would address the Left parties? concerns over the Electricity Act 2003 in the policies and rules, including the national electricity and tariff policies, which are currently being framed.

 Alls Well that ends Well 

 Care amp; Cure

 Chicago, Sept. 28 (Reuters): Health insurer WellPoint Inc has agreed to buy WellChoice Inc for nearly $6.5 billion in cash and stock, in a deal that would give WellPoint a stronger presence in the US Northeast. 

 WellPoint, which has grown into the biggest health plan by membership by consolidating local Blue Cross plans, said the combined company would now serve more than 33 million medical members as a Blue Cross or Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee in 14 states and through its HealthLink and UniCare subsidiaries. 

 WellChoice is the largest health insurer in New York State and the parent of Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, which has 4.8 million members. 

 We see a very compelling strategic fit and see our combined companies strongly positioned to compete in the marketplace, Larry Glasscock, WellPoint chief executive officer, told analysts and investors on a conference call. 

 The merger would strengthen WellPoints leadership in providing health benefits to large employers with multi-state operations, WellPoint said. 

 The largest Blue operator in the country is WellPoint, and they were missing the largest market for corporate headquarters, which happens to be New York state. It really fills a major hole, said Nancy Havens, president and portfolio manager for Havens Advisors, a $200 million hedge fund with merger arbitrage and high-yield debt portfolios. 

 In the merger, WellChoice shareholders would get $38.25 in cash and 0.5191 share of WellPoint, worth a combined $77.23, for each share of WellChoice. 

 The deal would give WellChoice shareholders a premium of about 9.4 per cent, based on WellChoices Monday closing price of $70.60. 

 Shares of WellChoice were up $4.75, or 6.7 per cent, to $75.35 in Tuesday afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, while shares of WellPoint slipped 38 cents to $74.71 on the exchange. 

 WellPoint expects the deal to be neutral to 2006 earnings and accretive thereafter. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2006.

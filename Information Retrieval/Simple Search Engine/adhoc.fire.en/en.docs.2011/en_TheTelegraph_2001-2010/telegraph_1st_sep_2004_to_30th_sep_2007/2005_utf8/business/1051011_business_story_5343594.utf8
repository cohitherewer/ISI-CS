 Innova hits the export track

 New Delhi, Oct. 10: Toyota Kirloskar Motors is making its first stab at exporting the Innova ? its multi-purpose vehicle ? to Nepal.

 We have just begun exporting Innova in very limited numbers to Nepal, Toyohi Ko Ino, director-marketing, TKM told The Telegraph.

 Last December, the carmaker phased out the Qualis, its multi-utility vehicle, which it used to export to the Himalayan kingdom. From January to August this year we have made no exports to Nepal, said Ino. In 2004, Toyota Kirloskar exported 30 Qualis to Nepal. 

 Asked about the target for Innova, Ino said, It is a new product all together. We have not set any targets. Lets see how demand picks up. But exports will be limited and not a large scale.

 The Qualis was replaced in India because we wanted to come up with advanced technology, says a company spokesperson.

 Targeted at the personal car market, Qualis widely ended up being used by tour and taxi drivers probably due to its sturdiness and powerful engine. The automobile company sold a total of 1.42 lakh units of Qualis between 2000 and 2004.

 Toyota Kirloskar replaced Qualis with the Innova, the all-new multi-purpose vehicle, which made its international debut in Indonesia last September. In India, the MPV was launched in February. 

 Innova is the second vehicle built on Toyotas new innovative multi-purpose vehicle (IMV) platform. The first one was Hilux Vigo, a model also launched in Indonesia. Priced between Rs 6.65 lakh and Rs 9.5 lakh, Innova is available in 10 variants ? five each in petrol and diesel.

 The company has sold close to 25,000 units during March-September this year. Innova primarily competes with General Motorss Tavera and Mahindra amp; Mahindras Scorpio and also with a few vehicles like Hondas City in the passenger car market.

 At present, Toyota Kirloskar enjoys a market share of nearly 5 per cent, which it plans to double by 2005. The total size of the car market is pegged at nearly 10 lakh units.

 When asked about the much spoken arrival of Toyotas small car in India, Ino said, Yes, we want to be present in this segment. We are making efforts but cannot give any deadline.

 Last week, Toyota Motors of Japan bought General Motorss 8.7 per cent stake in Fuji Heavy Industries. Worldwide, Fuji makes small cars in the brand name of Subaru. When asked whether there were plans to launch Subaru in India, Ino said, We have not heard anything in this direction from our head-office in Japan.

 Toyotas 420-acre plant in Bidadi, which started production in December 1999, has recently increased its annual capacity from 45,000 units to 60,000 units. In India, Toyota manufactures Corolla and Innova, while Camry and Prado are imported as completely built units.

 India Inc isn?t complaining

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 28: India Inc isn?t worried about the rising inflation in the near term and a possible nudge-up in interest rates further down the year.

 The industry is also not spooked by the recalibration of the reverse repo and doesn?t expect it to have any impact on near-term lending rates because there is still a lot of liquidity swirling about in the system that won?t crimp commercial credit.

 ?Given that these inflationary pressures will require some degree of demand restraint, the hike of 25 basis points in the repo rate is in the right direction as it indicates a move to a tighter monetary policy stance in the coming period,? the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said.

 Supporting adequate liquidity in banks, CII president Sunil Kant Munjal said the share of government securities in the aggregate banking sector portfolio still remains at 38.5 per cent, well above the 25 per cent statutory liquidity requirement.

 On a cautious note, however, the industry said it will call for a concerted effort from the government, the RBI and the corporate sector to keep inflationary pressures in check, which was the basis for successful management of inflation in 2004-05.

 The apex chamber welcomed the central bank?s pro-growth policy stand, with the RBI leaving interest rates unchanged.

 According to the central bank, India will witness a GDP growth of 7 per cent in financial year 2005-06, up from 6.9 per cent estimated for 2004-05.

 The GDP growth is largely being driven by an increase in non-food credit by 26.5 per cent in 2004-05. Also, resource mobilisation from equity markets and capacity expansion effort in the productive sectors of the economy will fuel growth in the economy.

 The chambers have also welcomed the proposal to increase the credit limit to farmers through the produce marketing scheme from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh and for micro finance agencies to access external commercial borrowings up to $5 million in any financial year.

 The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) said the monetary stance adopted by the RBI would provide sufficient liquidity and credit flow to industry to sustain investment for capacity expansion and growth.

 On the other hand, Ficci stressed the need to reduce the spread between the borrowing and the lending rate, particularly for small and medium companies to enable them to raise resources at a globally competitive price.

 Stating that the credit policy has laid emphasis on price stability, Assocham chief Mahendra K. Sanghi said corporate expectations on reduction of spread in the banks lending rates, dollar window for exporters and SMEs should have found place in the credit policy.

 On the other hand, liberalisation of the ceiling on overseas investment by Indian entities from 100 to 200 per cent of their net worth will also promote acquisition of necessary capacities abroad and promote export activity.

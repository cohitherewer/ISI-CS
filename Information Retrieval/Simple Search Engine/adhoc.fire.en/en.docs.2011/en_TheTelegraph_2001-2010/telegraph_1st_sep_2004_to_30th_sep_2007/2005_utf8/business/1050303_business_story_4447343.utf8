 Oil still on the boil, near $52

 Singapore, March 2 (Reuters): Oil prices hovered under $52 a barrel on Wednesday, supported by strong demand and forecasts of low heating oil stocks in the face of freezing weather in the United States.

 US light crude futures were down 3 cents to $51.65 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after hitting a four-month high of $52.28 on Monday. Prices are about $4 off the record peak of $55.67 in late October.

 Lower-than-normal temperatures in the US Northeast, the world?s biggest heating oil market, have led to a 1.4 million-barrel drop in US distillates stocks last week, a decline for the sixth-week running, a Reuters survey showed. But the survey found that crude stocks rose 1 million barrels and gasoline increased by 900,000 barrels. 

 ?Each time prices showed signs of moving down, the dips get bought fairly quickly and they go back up. I would have expected prices to ease due to the high gasoline stock levels as we are already moving out of the winter and into the gasoline season,? said Tony Nunan, a manager at the international petroleum section of Mitsubishi Corp.

 ?It would seem that the market is more focused on the macro factors like Opec having little spare capacity, strong demand from the US, China and India. This is the best chance for prices to fall and if they don?t fall now, I would hate to think what prices will be later.?

 Traders said the tight global supply-and-demand balance, along with the weaker dollar, had attracted increased interest from speculative funds in recent weeks.

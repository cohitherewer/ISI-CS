 New Delhi, Feb. 14: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today floated the idea of a pan-Asian gas pipeline grid that would supply consumers across various countries on the continent in a spirit of co-operation instead of fierce competition with each other.

 Addressing the third Asia gas buyers? summit here today, Aiyar said the countries in the region could go in for mutual investments in a gas pipeline network that could serve the entire continent as part of this ?co-operative approach?.

 He said such a vision was possible as Asia was home to most of the world?s gas discoveries and was also the region of the fastest-growing demand for gas with the rate of growth in India and China expanding at over 6 per cent per annum. 

 The geographical terrain in Asia did not pose any obstacle to laying such a pipeline network which could become a reality with all the companies of the region going in for a common investment plan. ?India could be the link between Central Asia and south-east Asia as we look at the world with friendly eyes,? he added. 

 Aiyar said India had a large demand for natural gas which would be required to sustain its projected 8 per cent rate of growth. ?We also have vast foreign exchange reserves to finance these purchases,? he added. 

 The minister said he had already informed Iran that India would require 100 million standard cubic metres of gas per day (MMSCMD). This is much more than 60 MMSCMD that had been initially planned through the proposed Iran-India pipeline via Pakistan. 

 National Iranian Gas Export Company chairman M. H. Rahbari, who is here for the summit, told reporters Iran welcomes participation of Indian companies in the development of the South Pars gas field which will supply natural gas to India through the proposed pipeline passing via Pakistan.

 Rahbari said the pipeline could be completed in five years. He will also be holding a technical discussion with the Indian side on the 2775-km transnational pipeline tomorrow.

 On security of supplies through the pipeline, he said, ?The pipeline is required by everybody. All partners need it and this is an assurance for safe delivery.?

 ?We should not be worried about the security of supplies as it is more important for us and Pakistan to ensure safe delivery of gas,? he added.

 Pakistan would take 20 per cent of the 75 million standard cubic metres per day of gas which had been planned from Iran and also get a transit fee.

 Of the 28 phases planned for development of the gigantic South Pars field, gas for Iran-India pipeline will come from a phase beyond the current 18 phases put under development.

 Gail plan

 Gail is holding talks with China Gas Holding Company for a 10 per cent stake in the gas company for supplying piped cooking gas in some of the provincial towns in China. 

 Gail chairman Proshanto Banerjee told The Telegraph that the China Gas MD had arrived here for the Asia gas buyers summit and the Gail team would be thrashing out the financial details with him.

 Gail officials said the deal was expected to come through in the next two days. 

 The Chinese government is offering as many as 48 licences for supplying gas to households in various towns of the country. Kogas of South Korea is also reported to be interested in entering China. 

 Gail already has a foreign presence as it has entered the domestic gas business in Egypt as a part of a joint venture with Natgas of Egypt.

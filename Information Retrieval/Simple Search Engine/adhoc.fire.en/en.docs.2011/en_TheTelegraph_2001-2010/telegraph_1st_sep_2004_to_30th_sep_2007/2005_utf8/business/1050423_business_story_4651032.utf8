 Anil missing from IPCL site, deal speculation peaks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Anil: Stop and go

 Mumbai, April 22: Anil Ambani does not figure on the list of directors posted on the website of Indian Petrochemicals Corporation (IPCL). 

 The deletion, ahead of the company?s board meeting on Tuesday to take stock of results, has triggered fresh speculation over where his row with elder brother Mukesh is headed.

 The immediate point of interest is whether this is part of a long-rumoured settlement under which Mukesh could get untrammelled control of the petro-chemicals and petroleum businesses while Anil walks away with Reliance Energy, Reliance Capital ? probably even Reliance Infocomm ? or a generous dose of cash.

 If Anil?s apparent exit from IPCL is not about sharing of spoils, it poses a bigger question: Will Mukesh and the board of the petrochem firm keep Anand Jain? This is the man Anil blamed for dividing the two brothers when he resigned as IPCL vice-chairman four months back. The board did ask him to reconsider the decision. Anil didn?t nor is it clear even now if the directors have accepted his quit-letter.

 ?The resignation of Anil Ambani, tendered on January 3, 2005, was noted by the board of directors at their meeting held on January 21. The subsequent letter, on January 27, addressed to the directors was placed before the board at a meeting on March 30 and noted by the board,? a statement issued by IPCL said today.

 The statement raises more questions than it answers. The words Anil?s letter was ?noted by the board? ? instead of the usual acceptance of a resignation ? has raised the eyebrows of Reliance observers. 

 Stock exchanges have not been informed of the change on the board, something they are required to if the composition of directors is modified in any way possible.

 In January this year, at the height of his feud over ownership issues with Mukesh, Anil hurled several allegations against Jain. ?I consider it against my dignity, self-respect and self-esteem to be on the same board as Anand Jain. He is heading the conspiracy to divide us (brothers) and to worsen our differences,? Anil said in his letter of resignation sent to IPCL directors.

 The Ambani faceoff was muted in the recent past until Anil wrote a letter to the home ministry early this month accusing Reliance Infocomm officials of tapping his phones.

 Several Reliance companies will hold board meetings next week, when they will dish out annual results. Company watchers will have their eyes peeled to spot new sparks of conflict in the simmering sibling spat.

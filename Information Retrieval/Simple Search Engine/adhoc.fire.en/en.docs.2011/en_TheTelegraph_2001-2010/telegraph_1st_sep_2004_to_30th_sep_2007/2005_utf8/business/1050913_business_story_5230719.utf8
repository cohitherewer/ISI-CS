 Peerless explores new areas to boost income

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 12: Faced with a stiff competition, Peerless General Finance amp; Investment Co, the home-grown residuary non-banking corporation, is exploring new avenues to boost income. The company has been operating as an RNBC for decades.

 Peerless plans to hawk various financial products, including life and general insurance, through its distribution channels.

 Speaking at the 72nd annual general meeting of the company here today, chairman D.N. Ghosh said given the restriction within which RNBCs operate, there are few options open to the company in its traditional business.

 The market for financial products has significantly expanded making inroads to the relatively sheltered markets in which your company is working, Ghosh said.

 There has been a phenomenal growth in the number of bank branches in smaller towns and villages. Mutual funds and life insurance offerings are dominating the market, along with a variety of innovative financial products. A shift in consumers preferences for such products is clearly visible, he added. 

 Peerless has already made a modest beginning by foraying into the insurance business as a corporate agent of the Life Insurance Corporation of India and National Insurance Co for marketing life and general insurance products respectively.

 Ghosh hinted that the company could restructure its existing business. While we are taking a close look at the viability of our products and service offerings and also the cost of our existing distribution channels, we need to urgently explore other avenues for diversifying our income stream, he said.

 Peerless had reported a 9.91per cent drop in total income last fiscal to Rs 3,233.3 crore from Rs 3,589.2 crore in the previous fiscal. Profit after tax was knocked off by a whopping 58.8 per cent in the same period, from Rs 158.8 crore to Rs 65.4 crore.

 However, collection was up by Rs 1,112.9 crore last fiscal, indicating erosion of margin in the overall operation.

 Peerless has recommended a dividend Rs 20 per share.

 Subsidiary plans

 Peerless Hotels Ltd, a subsidiary of the company, will add a new wing by the side of Peerless Inn in Calcutta. It would be a four-storied building with 40 rooms, a swimming pool, a state-of-the-art multi-gym and a wellness centre at the rooftop.

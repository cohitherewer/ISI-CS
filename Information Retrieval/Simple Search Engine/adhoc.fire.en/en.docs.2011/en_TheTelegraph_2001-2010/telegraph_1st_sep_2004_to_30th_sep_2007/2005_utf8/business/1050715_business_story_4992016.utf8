 Sebi probes share scam

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 14: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) is probing the alleged share transaction irregularity that came to light in Calcutta recently. The scam involved a leading stock brokerage of the country.

 The market regulator had received complaints from a section of aggrieved investors. We are looking into the matter, a Sebi official said from Mumbai.

 In their complaints sent to Sebi, retail investors had said they had suffered huge losses while investing in the stock market through Karvy. They claimed that despite paying the money, shares had not been deposited into their demat account.

 Karvy officials, however, said most of the allegations were baseless.

 There were about 80 customers who have a genuine problem. We have sorted it out and paid back whatever was due to them, a Karvy official said.

 They claimed that the irregularity was to the tune of only Rs 1.2 crore. 

 Any customer who came with a genuine claim has been attended to. Karvy has paid from its own pocket to protect the interest of aggrieved investors, said Alok Chaturvedi, the companys regional head.

 Karvy has 43 active branches in Bengal and the irregularity occurred only at the Bidhannagar centre.

 Meanwhile, the North 24 Parganas district police, which have started probing the allegations, are collecting data from different agencies. 

 This is not a simple case and involves lot of technicalities. We are in the process of compiling information from different sources and it would take us time, said Praveen Kumar, the district superintendent of police. As of now, the CID has not been roped into the case.

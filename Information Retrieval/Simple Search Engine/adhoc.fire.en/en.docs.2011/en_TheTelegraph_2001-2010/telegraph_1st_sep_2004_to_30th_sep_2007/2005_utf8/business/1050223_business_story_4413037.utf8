 ONGC teams up with Gazprom

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: ONGC has signed a memorandum of understanding with Russian gas major Gazprom for collaboration in oil and gas exploration, gas processing and setting up petrochemicals plants. 

 The MoU was signed in Moscow by ONGC chairman Subir Raha and Gazprom chief Alexie Miller. Gazprom also has a presence in India as it is undertaking exploration in an offshore block in the Bay of Bengal in partnership with Gail.

 Riding on the Sakhalin I success story, ONGC is negotiating for a stake in Sakhalin III and Vankor oilfield. 

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar who is in Moscow in an attempt to woo Russian oil companies to invest in the oil and gas blocks that India is offering under the new exploration licensing policy will also examine the opportunity of ONGC-Videsh picking up a stake in the Russian oil assets.

 He is of the view that ONGC is a zero debt company and can raise up to $25 billion from banks, based on its market cap provided the oil assets are worth it. 

 Aiyar is keen that the Russian companies participate in the oil hunt in India as they have played a crucial role in helping ONGC discover the Mumbai High oilfields where the western experts had said there was no oil. 

 Gail move

 The Gail (India) board has approved the acquisition of up to 10 per cent equity stake in China Gas Holdings. The Indian company will subscribe to 210 million new shares of China Gas Holding.

 Gail chairman Proshanto Banerjee and China Gas managing director Liu Ming Hui have signed the share subscription agreement. 

 China Gas and Gail have also agreed to establish a strategic co-operative partnership and will form a joint venture to undertake projects in China, India and third countries. 

 The two companies will have a 50:50 interest in the joint venture which will work for the operation and management of city gas pipeline networks, including the purchase, sale and distribution of gas through these networks.

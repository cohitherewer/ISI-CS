 Ficci sees growth spike in durables 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 16: The consumer durables segment is set to achieve a double-digit growth in 2005-06, according to a survey by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 Industry is all set to achieve a growth of 15 to 20 per cent for colour TVs, 25 per cent for DVD, 5 to 10 per cent for refrigerators, 20 to 25 per cent for air-conditioners and 5 to 10 per cent for washing machines and 25 per cent for microwave ovens, the survey said.

 It predicted that the VCDs and MP3 segments will achieve a growth rate of 30 per cent while the clock and watch segments could achieve a growth of 10 per cent each.

 While the CTV segment faced a negative growth of 5.3 per cent in April-June 2005, the category achieved a volume growth of 36.2 per cent and value growth of 25.8 per cent in the first quarter of 2005-06, the survey said.

 The price difference between branded and non-branded goods has narrowed. In addition, efficient after-sales service support is influencing customer preference for branded products, Ficci president Onkar Kanwar said.

 According to the study, the urban consumer durable market for products, including TVs, grew by 7 to 10 per cent, whereas the rural sector posted a 25 per cent growth annually.

 The refrigerator industry reached 3.9 million units in 2004-05 from 3.7 million units in the previous fiscal, registering a growth 5 per cent, the survey said. 

 Similarly, the air-conditioning industry achieved sales of 1.2 million units during 2004-05 with a growth of 25 per cent from 9.8 lakh units in 2003-04. 

 The industry is definitely poised for a double-digit growth for the next couple of years. India will also see participation from a lot of multinational companies. By 2008, the country is set to be one of the top markets for consumer electronics, said an official from LG Electronics India Limited.

 The consumer durable industry appears to have two clearly differentiated segments. The multinationals have an edge over their Indian counterparts in terms of technology, combined with a steady flow of capital.

 Domestic companies, on the other hand, compete on the basis of their brands, an extensive distribution network and an insight into local market conditions.

 The study also points out that attractive consumer loan schemes with reduced interest rates offered by commercial banks and financial institutions have added to the surge in demand.

 Besides, consumer goods companies also offer attractive finance schemes to consumers through their extensive dealer network.

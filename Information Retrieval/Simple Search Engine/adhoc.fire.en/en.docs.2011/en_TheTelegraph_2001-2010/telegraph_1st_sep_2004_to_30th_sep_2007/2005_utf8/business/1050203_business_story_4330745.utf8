 Rupee at highest point in five years

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 2: S amp;P?s rating boost sent the rupee soaring to a five-year closing high against the dollar at 43.42 today. Forex experts reckon that the upgrade will help Indian firms borrow at lower rates in overseas markets.

 Even on a daily comparison, the currency was 30 paise stronger over Tuesday?s close of 43.71; it opened at 43.66. Dealers said the Indian currency was hovering around the 43.60-mark until news of the S amp;P upgrade came in. 

 ?Once the 43.50 level was conquered, the rupee started gaining sharply. There were some deals even at 43.39. It settled at 43.42, a level not seen since December 1999,? said a treasury chief with a leading private sector bank.

 The rupee has been going from strength to strength, encouraged by the robust inflows from foreign institutional investors who pumped in over Rs 800 crore on Monday. The record inflows saw the currency appreciate 4.92 per cent in 2004 after a 4.32 per cent increase in 2003.

 Analysts tracking the currency markets say the gains will continue in the coming days, though all eyes are now on the outcome of the US Federal Reserve meeting. Treasury heads expect a 25 basis points hike to 2.5 per cent. Analysts are watching signals to see whether the rise in the cost of money will be rapid or gradual.

 For local firms, the S amp;P upgrade will mean cheaper loans abroad and, as some analysts say, lower hedging costs. Last year, many firms had taken advantage of a lower interest rate regime and borrowed heavily overseas; some put this figure at a little more than $5 billion. 

 However, there are a few who feel the benefit to India Inc from the rating boost will be marginal, at most. 

 ?Dollar interest rates have gone up from 1 per cent to 2.25 per cent. This could be hiked to 2.50 per cent. Though India?s rating has improved, this will only have a marginal effect as the absolute cost has gone up on account of rising interest rates overseas,? said U. Venkatraman, head forex and treasury operations at IDBI.

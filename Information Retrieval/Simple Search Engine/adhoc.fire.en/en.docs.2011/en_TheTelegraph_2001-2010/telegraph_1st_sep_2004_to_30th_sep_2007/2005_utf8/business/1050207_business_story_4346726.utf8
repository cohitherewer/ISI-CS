 AC companies want duty-cooling comfort

 - Clamour 

 for more in budget build-up

 Change is in the air 

 Mumbai, Feb. 6: Air-conditioner (AC) makers have called for changes in the excise and customs duty structure. They want the 8 per cent special excise duty removed and new import duty tariffs adopted where the landed cost of components is less than that of the finished product.

 The industry feels that these sops in the 2005-06 budget will improve its competitiveness and market penetration, apart from making air-conditioners more affordable.

 In a pre-budget memorandum presented to Union finance minister P. Chidambaram, the Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Manufacturers? Association said in thelast decade, consumer durables have come of age because of increased spending, higher disposable income and falling prices.

 As a result, many people can now afford luxury goods. Televisions, audio electronics, refrigerators, washing machines, vacuum cleaners and kitchen electricals are within easy reach.

 The association observed that in a nation where climatic factors make an air-conditioner a necessity, market penetration is only 1 per cent. This is despite the fact that advanced technologies and easy manufacturing have brought prices down to more affordable levels. ?This is because air-conditioners are not on a level-playing field with other consumer durables as far as excise and customs levies are concerned. As a result, the industry is handicapped,? it added.

 Room ACs up to 3 tonnes and packaged units are subject to 24 per cent excise duty ? 16 per cent basic excise and 8 per cent SED. 

 ?This is an arbitrary burden holding back an industry with immense growth prospects,? it said. According to the association, the average growth has been 20 per cent in the last two years, which is considerably lower than the industry?s true potential. 

 Most air-conditioner manufacturers have been forced to set up units in tax havens like Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal, which offer full excise duty exemption in certain districts. 

 In 2004-05, 40 per cent of air conditioners were made in these states. In 2005-06, 8.5 to 9 lakh units of the total domestic sales of 12.5 lakh units are likely to be built in these pockets.

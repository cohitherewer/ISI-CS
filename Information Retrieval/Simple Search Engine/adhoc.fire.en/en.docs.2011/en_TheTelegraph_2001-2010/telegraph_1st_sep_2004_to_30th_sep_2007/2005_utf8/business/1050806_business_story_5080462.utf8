 Xenitis group bets big on exports

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 5: The Xenitis group will use its component manufacturing unit as an exporting base to Africa, Australia, Russia and West Asia. 

 The company has already established a presence in Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.

 We are currently manufacturing cabinets, power supply units, media chips and peripherals like keyboards, mouse and speakers. In the second phase, we will make monitors, motherboards, RAM, floppy disk and CD-ROM drives, Xenitis chairman Santanu Ghosh said. 

 This will allow us to source almost 90 per cent of the components for a PC from our own plant and also help reduce costs, he added. 

 Xenitis will manufacture these components along with its Chinese partner, Unitek Computer Company Ltd.

 Xenitis has already invested Rs 100 crore in the unit and plans to infuse another Rs 100 crore during the second phase of expansion.

 The company has bagged an order for 7,500 units from an Australian firm.

 Entrepreneurship was the right way to utilise the huge pool of skilled resources in the country. It will also help companies take the lead in introducing cost-competitive products that will grow the market and increase PC penetration, Union IT minister Dayanidhi Maran said at the inauguration of the manufacturing unit with a 9-lakh monthly capacity.

 The unit, spread over 1,40,000 sq ft, will initially scale up its employee strength from 450 to 1,700 people. Its staff strength will increase to 4,000 after completion of the second phase. It is also expected to provide indirect employment to over 5,000 people.

 Of the total 9 lakh units manufactured, domestic consumption will be around 4 lakh, said Ghosh. 

 Over the next few years, almost 50 per cent of the production will be for the export market, he added.

 This year, the company has targeted a turnover of Rs 550 crore with Rs 100 crore from exports.

 The company, with a headcount of 450, touched revenues of over Rs 180 crore last year by selling computers under the brand name Aamar PC.

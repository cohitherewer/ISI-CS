 Rio Tinto wins Peru contract

 Lima, Dec. 17 (Reuters): Rio Tinto, the only bidder for Perus massive La Granja copper project, won the auction with a $82-million bid, Perus state investment agency, ProInversion, has said.

 Rio Tinto agreed to pay $22 million for the project in northern Peru and initially invest $60 million in the project. The government has put La Granjas total development cost at $700 million.

 La Granja is likely to begin production in around eight years time, according to government forecasts.

 Canadas Barrick Gold Corp., Switzerlands Xstrata Plc, Teck Cominco Ltd. of Canada, Brazils CVRD and Mexican-Peru miner Southern Copper Corp. had qualified for the auction but did not bid.

 At more than 6,500 feet above sea level, La Granja has some 1.2 billion tonnes of ore with a 0.65 per cent copper grade. Its current reserves are twice those of Perus other huge copper deposit Las Bambas, which Xstrata paid $121 million to develop last August.

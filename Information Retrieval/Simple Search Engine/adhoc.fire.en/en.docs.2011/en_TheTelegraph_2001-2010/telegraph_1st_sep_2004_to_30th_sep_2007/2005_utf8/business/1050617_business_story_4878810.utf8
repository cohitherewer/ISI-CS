 Mumbai, June 16: French oil major Total is planning to rope in a domestic player to set up a refinery here. 

 Disclosing this here today, senior Total official Gary Jones said the move is being contemplated as the company wants to set up retail outlets to sell petroleum products.

 Jones, who is a senior vice-president looking after the refining and marketing business in Asia, was speaking to reporters after TotalFinaElf India signed an agreement with Reliance Industries to sell automotive lubricants from the latters fuel stations across the country. 

 While Total is planning to set up its own retail outlets in the country, existing regulations stipulate that companies must invest $450 million in the petroleum sector. So far, the company has spent close to $200 million in India.

 Pointing out that India is a rapidly growing market, Jones said the company was examining various options to make additional investments as it was keen on entering the retail business of petro products. 

 ?Further to our existing investment in LNG, LPG, lubricants and other specialities, we are exploring other opportunities in refining and marketing to strengthen our position in India,? he said.

 When asked whether Total would consider investing in a local refinery, Jones said since refineries were highly capital intensive, the company would favour a joint venture with a local partner. He, however, refused comment on whether Total was in talks with domestic refineries for picking up a stake, though the company in the recent past had picked up a 22.5 per cent stake in a Chinese refinery.

 Business strategy

 TotalFinaElf India, the French major?s 100 per cent subsidiary, today announced a comprehensive business strategy. The company will expand its dealer and distribution network as well as export specialised and selective products to other Asian markets. 

 To increase volumes, the company will focus on institutional sales, develop OEM relationships and expand business with petro outlets. 

 On the other hand, the association with Reliance is expected to open up an entirely new channel of retail sales for Elf products. It will lead to an increase in market penetration for Elf through 2,000 Reliance outlets by 2006. 

 According to Thierry Gautier, CEO of TotalFinaElf India, ?Asia will account for 60 per cent of long-term lubricants market growth. India should rank number fourth in the group?s worldwide lubricants sales by 2010.?

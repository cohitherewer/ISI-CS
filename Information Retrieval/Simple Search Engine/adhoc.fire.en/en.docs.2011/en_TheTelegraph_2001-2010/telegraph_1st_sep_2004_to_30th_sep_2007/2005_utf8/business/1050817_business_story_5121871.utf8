 Tata Power runs Bengal site scan

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Banerjee: Helping hand

 Calcutta, Aug. 16: The Tatas have asked the Bengal government to find a site close to coal and water sources for Tata Power?s 500-mw thermal project. The company is also interested in the state?s power distribution sector.

 State power minister Mrinal Banerjee said, ?We had earlier shown the Tatas the land at Balagarh near Hooghly. But they have rejected it after carrying out a survey. They have asked us to find a place, which has the infrastructure to set up power plants. We have identified some sites for them.?

 Balagarh, which was earlier offered to CESC, is a low-lying area and Tata Power feels that the 420-hectare plot is unsuitable for a power plant.

 The proposed site is expected to be in Burdwan district, which has the Asansol-Raniganj coal belt nearby. However, Banerjee has refused to pinpoint the site.

 ?We will soon hold talks with the Tata Power management regarding the land,? Banerjee added.

 The thermal power plant plan, which will cost Rs 2,000 crore, was first proposed by Tata group chairman Ratan Tata to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee last year during the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) summit in the city.

 ?We had a few rounds of talks with the then Tata Power managing director Firdose Vandrevala. But he has joined Tata Tele. Negotiations will now begin with the new management at Tata Power. We are keen to bring in Tata Power?s investment in the state. Moreover, as more power stations come up in the state it will be easier for us to meet the demand-supply gap,? the power minister said.

 Tata Power is the country?s largest private sector power utility. It has an installed generation capacity of 2203 mw. 

 The company transmits, distributes and generates thermal, hydro, solar and wind power.

 Its thermal power stations are located at Trombay in Mumbai, Jojobera in Jamshedpur and Belgaum in Karnataka. 

 The company also has power stations in Raigad district of Maharashtra and in Ahmednagar. 

 A correct combination of hydel and thermal enables the company to supply power at cost-effective tariffs to customers. 

 The company?s transmission and distribution losses are at 2.4 per cent, the lowest in the country. 

 Regarding CESC?s proposal to set up a 1000-mw plant at Katwa, the power minister said, ?I am not aware about CESC?s project. I only know that West Bengal Power Development Corporation is setting up a 1000 mw power plant at Katwa and the project has received an in- principle approval from the government.?

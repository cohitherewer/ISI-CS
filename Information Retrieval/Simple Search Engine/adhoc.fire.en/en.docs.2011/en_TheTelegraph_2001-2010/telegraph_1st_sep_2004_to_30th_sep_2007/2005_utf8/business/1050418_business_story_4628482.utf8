 Phoenix chief plays safe 

 London, April 17 (AP): The chairman of the company that owns collapsed British carmaker MG Rover has denied that he stripped money from the stricken firm.

 The government has ordered a formal inquiry into MG Rover?s accounts and accused the directors of parent company Phoenix Venture Holdings of taking too much cash out of the business.

 But in a newspaper interview published today, Phoenix chairman John Towers said he earned less than other executives in similar jobs.

 ?My annual salary has been ?200,000 ($380,000),? Towers was quoted as telling The Sunday Mercury, a weekly paper published in central England, where MG Rover is based. ?If you look at the salaries of other company chairmen within the same industry, you will see that this is significantly below the average,? he said. ?It is very easy to get consumed by the character assassination stuff that is going on,? he added.

 Rover?s administrators announced Friday that they planned to break up the only major British-owned auto manufacturer after a lifesaving deal with a Chinese firm fell through. More than 5,000 of Rover?s 6,000 employees will lose their jobs.

 Trade and industry secretary Patricia Hewitt said the independent financial reporting council would look into the accounts of MG Rover and Phoenix. She said she expected the directors of Phoenix to make a personal contribution toward supporting the workforce.

 Towers said he didnt welcome the new inquiry into MG Rover?s finances, but added that he had nothing to hide.

 Tony Blairs Labour government has offered workers and suppliers at MG Rover $283 million in aid, seeking to limit the damage from up to 5,000 job losses as it seeks re-election. 

 Administrators said on Friday there was no hope of selling the last major British carmaker in one piece, and just under 5,000 workers would be made redundant immediately, dealing a blow to the ruling partys image of economic competence.

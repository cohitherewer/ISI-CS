 Media demerger on Hinduja TMT menu

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 31: Hindjua TMT plans to demerge its media business into a separate listed entity.

 While the company board has authorised a committee of directors to work out a detailed scheme in this regard, the company today told the stock exchanges that the proposal presented by the management envisages two debt-free listed companies with mirror image shareholding.

 Of this, one will consist of the information technology (IT) businesses, IT subsidiaries and the main financial investments such as in Fascel Ltd. 

 The other newly formed entity will have the media business that includes film content, cable TV distribution network and broadband (high-speed Internet and related value-added services).

 Explaining the need for a demerger, Hindjua TMT said besides having IT as its core business, the company also has a presence in media and broadband businesses through its subsidiaries. It also has substantial investments in companies such as Fascel Ltd (cellular services operations) and other liquid assets. 

 In the last four years, the company?s IT business has grown at an industry-leading rate to become a significant player in the country. The recent acquisition of Source One Communications Inc, USA, and Customer Contact Centre Inc, Philippines, also provided the company with global delivery capabilities.

 ?To sharpen focus on IT business for a better performance, it is necessary to attract Global 1000 customers and top-class talent. Additional inorganic growth initiatives will require a focused entity with a single business interest,? it added. 

 Hindjua TMT said the media and broadband businesses have also become well established and are prepared to participate in an era of explosive growth aided by regulatory moves in motion.

 ?In future, expansions through alliances, partnerships, strategic investments and joint ventures including mergers and acquisitions will be a key growth strategy for these businesses. To deal with the changing business environment, whereby convergence within the sector is a challenge and an opportunity, it is considered necessary to have a separate listed entity focused on the media ? broadband businesses,? Hindjua TMT said.

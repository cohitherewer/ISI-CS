 France Tele buys Amena

 UPWARDLY MOBILE

 Paris, July 27 (Reuters): France Telecom clinched its first foreign acquisition in four years on Wednesday, paying 6.4 billion euros ($7.72 billion) in cash for control of Spains third biggest mobile operator Amena.

 France Telecom said the deal to buy 80 per cent of Amena, the wireless arm of Spains Auna, valued the whole company at 10.6 billion euros, including debt and expected tax credits of more than 1.7 billion euros.

 The acquisition will see the partly state-owned French company, which is emerging from three years of cost cutting and debt reduction, move deeper into one of Europes fastest growing and most profitable mobile phone markets.

 France Telecom said it will merge its existing fixed-line and Internet operations in Spain with Amena, creating a business with 17 per cent of the Spanish telecom market.

 This merger reinforces France Telecoms leading role in one of the most attractive telecommunication markets in Europe, the company said in a statement.

 The move marks a further pick-up in telecom mergers and acquisitions, coming fresh on the heels of Eircoms takeover of Irelands third-biggest wireless operator Meteor for 420 million euros via a share issue on Monday.

 Shares in France Telecom, Europes second largest telecom operator in terms of sales, were up 1.97 per cent by 24.85 euros.

 The terms of the deal are better than expected but there are no real surprises, Manuel Lachaux, analyst at French brokerage ETC Pollak said.

 Spain is Europes fifth largest telecom market with the mobile sector expected to grow by about 6 per cent a year between 2005 and 2008, better than the European average, the company said.

 France Telecom said as part of the deal the company will take on an extra 3.4 billion euros of new debt and issue 3 billion euros of share either to Amenas vendors, or through an offer to France Telecoms other shareholders.

 Jindals on ally hunt for Jharkhand

 Mumbai, Nov. 10: Sajjan Jindal is keen to avoid past mistakes. The man at the helm of one of the country?s steel powerhouses could consider a foreign partner for a Rs 35000-crore project that has just been formalised in Jharkhand.

 ?I am open to joint ventures with other steel companies or even setting up an independent company under the JSW umbrella in Jharkhand. We are considering all options. We do not rule out anything,? he said.

 The need for an ally has been prompted by the realisation that there is a need to share the kind of risks that bedevilled Jindal Steel?s projects set up in the early 90s.

 Many of these have had to be revived through loan revamps; a few had to wait for an upturn in the industry cycle.

 Jindal knows it?s a scrum out there. Mittal Steel, Ispat group, Essar Group and Tata Steel are tugging at the door of the ore-rich Jharkhand and Orissa with big projects.

 Jindal is wary of raising a mountain of debt for new plans, which include an expansion in JSW?s capacity from 2.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to 3.8 mtpa by March 2006 and, eventually, to 7 mtpa three years from now.

 While Mittal Steel and Posco have signed pacts with the Jharkhand and Orissa governments, there are others still mulling a beachhead, including Arcelor. All the same, Jindal is unflappable. ?Even Japanese steel makers are yet to make an entry into India,? he ripostes. 

 Jindal keeps his cards close to the chest, but the one strategy he is ready to share is how he intends to rein in spending. The critical components of the 2.8-mtpa blast furnace planned in Jharkhand come from Siemens VAI but other elements of the Rs 5000-crore steel-melting cauldron will be made at JSW?s Bellary unit. This should shave 20-25 per cent from the cost of what Jindal says will be the most modern and largest blast furnace in India.

 The Tatas, by contrast, have farmed out their projects to civil contractors and capital equipment makers. 

 Asked whether there is enough demand for steel in India and abroad with a rash of expansion plans, Jindal says, ?If we increase supply, the demand invariably comes.?

 Barings keeps MphasiS stake 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Rao: Status quo

 Bangalore, Aug. 24: Barings India Investments, which holds over 35 per cent in MphasiS, has decided to retain its stake.

 After evaluating the merits of the proposals put forth by various companies, Barings India today decided not to entertain any of the offers and informed MphasiS about its decision.

 Hinduja TMT and Temasek Holdings, an investment arm of the Singapore government, were in the fray to acquire Barings Indias stake in the company managed by Jerry Rao, merchant banking sources said. 

 Reports suggest that Barings was disappointed by the low bids made by the two bidders. There are rumours that Tata Consultancy Services was also interested.

 Given our strong customer franchise and robust prospects, we would not like to entertain any of the offers, Barings informed MphasiS.

 It is business as usual and the focus has to be to improve customer satisfaction, profitability and growth, it said.

 Barings had appointed an investment banker to explore the stake sale. It was based on significant premiums for unsolicited offers, Barings had said then. 

 During the interim period when Barings was in exit mode, the mood in the company was glum.

 Two senior officials of MphasiS BFL, including chief financial officer Ravi Ramu quit. Sources, however, say it had nothing to do with Barings selling its stake in the company.

 The MphasiS group is a leading provider of software and system integration technology and IT-enabled services for consumer-focused corporations. The company has 9000 plus employees.

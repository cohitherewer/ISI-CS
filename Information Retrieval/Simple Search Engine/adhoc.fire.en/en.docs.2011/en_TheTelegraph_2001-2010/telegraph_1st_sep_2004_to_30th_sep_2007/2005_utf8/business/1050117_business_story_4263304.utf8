 Cell firms fight grey threat

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, Jan. 16: The cellular industry is gearing up to deal with the grey market menace in the component and accessories segment.

 Industry sources said a mere 5 per cent of the component and accessories market was now traded through the legal route, with the government expected to lose an estimated Rs 2,734 crore between 2004 and 2008 with the current duty structure.

 The accessories and components industry is estimated at Rs 1200 crore and is growing by 25 to 30 per cent every year.

 ?The reason for the heavy tilt towards grey is the high duty imposed on spare parts and accessories. The total levy on parts of cellular phones and radio trunking terminals is 22.58 per cent, thus making the counterfeits widespread,? he said. The total duty on battery packs for cellular phones, which fall under a different classification, amounts to 40.38 per cent. ?The dual duty structure is only fuelling the grey market where counterfeits and recycled batteries are ruining mobile phones,? he added. To this is added the 10.2 per cent service tax.

 ?In the current scenario, the government will earn a Rs 144-crore revenue in 2004-08, while the loss will be Rs 2734 crore. The revised duty structure will result in a 365 per cent growth in revenue with losses coming down to Rs 656 crore and earnings going up to Rs 525 crore,? he said.

 The solution would be to classify all components, parts, spares and accessories for after-sales service and reselling and battery packs for cellular phones under a single head with uniform duty structure.

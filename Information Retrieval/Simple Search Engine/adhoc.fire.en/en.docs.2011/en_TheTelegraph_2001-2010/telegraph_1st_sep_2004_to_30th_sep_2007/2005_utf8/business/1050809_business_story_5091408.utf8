 Lupin inks Japanese deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 8: Lupin Ltd is entering the Japanese market. It has signed an agreement with Kyowa Pharmaceutical Industry Co Ltd of Japan for marketing finished formulations in that country. 

 This is part of the companys strategy of venturing into new overseas markets. 

 While Lupins international revenue is set to increase, it will enter new markets like Japan, managing director Kamal K. Sharma told the Telegraph.

 Japan is the second biggest market for pharmaceutical products in the world with $52 billion sales. Generics constitute about 5 per cent of this market. 

 Under the deal, Lupin will undertake product development and manufacture, while Kyowa will conduct biostudies, obtain regulatory approvals and market the products in Japan.

 Lupin said the Japanese government is actively supporting the use of generics in order to bring down the cost of medicines.

 A foreign generic company faces formidable entry barriers in Japan owing to the complex regulatory environment and a strong patent framework prevalent there.

 Lupin chairman D.B. Gupta said, This is the first major step we are taking to enter the Japanese market. We are enthusiastic about the collaboration with Kyowa and expect the scope of our collaboration to expand substantially in the future.

 India is the fastest growing country in terms of generic drugs. Thus, we cannot foresee growth without getting along with Indian companies. We think Lupin is the best partner in India and expect to expand our business relationship in the future, said Kyowa president Tadashi Sugiura.

 Last month, Lupin had launched the generic version of Ceftriaxone vials for injection in the US.

 Ceftriaxone is the generic equivalent of Rocephin marketed by Roche. The market size for Ceftriaxone was at $756 million in the US. It went off patent on July 19 and Lupin launched it the following day. The company has entered into an agreement with US-based Baxter Healthcare Corporation to distribute the Ceftriaxone vials.

 Simultaneously, Lupin also entered into a separate agreement with Henry Schein Inc for the sale of this product to physicians offices.

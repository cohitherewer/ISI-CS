 CII sows farm optimism, sees 7.2% growth

 New Delhi, June 5: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has forecast a 7.2 per cent growth in the economy in 2005-06 on the back of a robust growth in the agriculture sector.

 In its state-of-the-economy report, the CII expects the output forecast of the agriculture sector to increase by 3 per cent this fiscal compared with 1 per cent last year.

 However, the report cautioned about some downside risks for industrial growth next year. A slowdown in the infrastructure sector, whose growth fell to 4.4 per cent in 2004-05 from 6.2 per cent in 2003-04, will impose a constraint on industrial performance, the report said.

 Moreover, the RBI projection for growth of non-food credit is 19 per cent for 2005-06. This is significantly lower than 26.5 per cent witnessed last fiscal.

 Factors likely to yield higher growth in agriculture are normal Southwest monsoon, an improvement in the distribution of certified seeds, higher than targeted growth in commercial bank credit to agriculture and a favourable trend reversal in the gross capital formation in agriculture.

 The last financial year witnessed a strong and broad-based industrial growth with the index of industrial production rising by 8 per cent compared with 7 per cent in 2003-04.

 This was due to a robust capacity expansion. The index of industrial production for capital goods was up 12.6 per cent along with a near 24 per cent rise in imports of machinery and equipment.

 Construction activity has grown 5.7 per cent in 2004-05 and is likely to retain this momentum with further liberalisation of FDI in to real estate announced last year.

 Based on strong growth sentiments reported in the survey and a majority of sector associations, too, reporting a positive outlook, the CII has forecast industrial growth at 8.1 per cent for 2005-06.

 The report, however, cautions about certain other aspects of the economic growth. 

 The RBI projection for growth of non-food credit is 19 per cent for 2005-06, which is significantly lower than 26.5 per cent in 2004-05, and may result in a lower investment demand by the private sector.

 The report observed that the services sector has maintained its buoyancy in 2004-05 for the third year in a row. 

 IT services and software sectors are estimated to grow by 28.9 per cent in 2004-05, with exports expected to record a growth of 32.3 per cent.

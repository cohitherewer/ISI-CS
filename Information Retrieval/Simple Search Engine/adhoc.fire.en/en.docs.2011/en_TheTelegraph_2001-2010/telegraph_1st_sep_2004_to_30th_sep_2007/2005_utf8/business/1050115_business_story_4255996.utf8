 Indoco Remedies sizzles on stock market debut

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 14: Indoco Remedies today joined a growing list of initial public offers (IPO) that have made a sizzling debut.

 The shares of the pharmaceutical company surged 62 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) after a flotation that had 60 times as many bids as shares on offer. 

 The strike price was finalised at Rs 245 per share (of Rs 10) in the Rs 73.5-crore issue. The stock, listed at Rs 410, rallied 79.6 per cent to Rs 440 before closing at Rs 396.

 Investors attribute the surge to an unfulfilled appetite for new shares in issues where only a handful of applicants are lucky enough to get allotments. The ones who are left out rush in the moment a stock is listed.

 The roaring start by Indoco, which makes a range of anti-spasmodic, anti-cold preparations, ophthalmic and oral hygiene products, follows Bharti Shipyard?s flourish on bourses when its stock was listed a few weeks back.

 What is different this time round is that the number of investors missing out on new offers is steadily increasing. This is unlike the trends in March last year, when companies gave applicants proportionate allotment in the big-ticket offerings of CMC, Gail and IPCL. Even TCS tried to give almost every applicant a place.

 Indoco said the response from all categories of investors was encouraging. The part reserved for institutions was oversold 38.84 times, while retail investors put in 3.66 lakh applications, overshooting the quota 70.84 times.

 The company will use part of the IPO funds for an expansion plan that includes a formulation plant at Baddi in Himachal Pradesh, a research centre, repayment of loans, brand acquisition and purchase of office space.

 Shares offered in the issue made up 25.38 per cent of Indoco?s post-issue paid-up capital. Promoters will own 61.89 per cent of the firm?s post-IPO equity capital of Rs 11.82 crore.

 The expectation is that the forthcoming issues of Jet Airways, IDFC, Shoppers? Stop will command big premiums when these shares are listed. This will whet the appetite of investors and keep primary markets vibrant.

 Profit dose

 Indoco?s second-quarter net profit surged 166 per cent to Rs 7.05 crore while its revenues went up to rs 42.85 crore.

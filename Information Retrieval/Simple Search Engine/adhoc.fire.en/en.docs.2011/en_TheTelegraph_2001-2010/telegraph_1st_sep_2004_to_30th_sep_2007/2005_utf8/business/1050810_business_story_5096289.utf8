 Oil price back on cabinet menu

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 9: The petroleum ministry has approached the cabinet with a proposal to increase domestic prices of petroleum products as international rates have soared to an all-time high of $64 a barrel. Moreover, state-run oil companies have plunged into the red. 

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today said the price-hike decision rested with the cabinet. However, he did not say when the die would be cast. 

 The minister said the government would try to do a balancing act between the interests of consumers and the oil firms, which have lost more than Rs 9,700 crore in revenues this fiscal due to the price freeze. 

 The public sector oil companies are losing Rs 3.63 per litre on petrol sales and Rs 4.15 per litre on diesel. LPG is being sold at a loss of Rs 92 per cylinder and the loss on kerosene sales works out to Rs 11 per litre.

 The minister said: All information has been shared with the cabinet. Now its for the cabinet to decide, he said.

 The petroleum minister said the rise in international prices was based on apprehensions of a disruption in supplies although there has been no such interruption in the past 18 months.

 There is nothing in the global economy to warrant such a rise. Not one drop of oil has been lost. It has become a fashion statement rather than any kind of reflection on global realities, he complained.

 I am worried but not too worried. The government has resources to manage our requirements, the minister added.

 Petroleum secretary S.C. Tripathi has informed the cabinet secretary that the net-worth of the public sector oil companies would be eroded and they would turn sick if the current pricing policy continues. 

 IOC, which has suffered a net loss of Rs 54.2 crore in the first quarter (April-June), it lost Rs 744 crore in the month of July alone. Bharat petroleum has piled up a loss of Rs 400 crore during the month compared with Rs 431.3 crore loss in the first quarter, while Hindustan Petroleum suffered Rs 475 crore as loss in July on top of Rs 507.89 crore net loss in the first quarter. 

 IBP is the most vulnerable and on the basis of the present trend would turn sick by the end of next month. The company reported a net loss of Rs 233.97 crore in April-June followed by a loss of Rs 189 crore in July.

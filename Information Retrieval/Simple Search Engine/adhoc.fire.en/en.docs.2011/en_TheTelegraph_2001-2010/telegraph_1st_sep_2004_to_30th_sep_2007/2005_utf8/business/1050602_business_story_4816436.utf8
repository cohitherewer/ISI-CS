 Transaction tax account opened

 Token Tab

 Mumbai, June 1: Withdrawals of over Rs 25,000 on a single day from current accounts in banks are being taxed from today.

 Bankers said while retail depositors will not be impacted by the 0.1 per cent transaction tax as savings accounts have been exempted, cash intensive businesses will be affected as withdrawals from their accounts above the limit will be taxed. 

 The construction business will have to bear the brunt as employers require cash regularly for the contract workers, a bank official said.

 Though it is too early to assess the impact, small companies could avoid paying the tax by opening many accounts instead of a single one.

 The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), which issued a notification on Tuesday, said if the total withdrawal exceeded Rs 25,000 by individuals or Rs 1 lakh by businesses on a single day even through multiple transactions, the tax would be imposed. It added that cash receipts exceeding Rs 25,000 on a single day on encashment of one or more term deposits by an individual or a Hindu undivided family (HUF) would also be taxed.

 Union finance minister P. Chidambaram initially planned to introduce a transaction tax on withdrawals of Rs 10,000 and above. He raised the limit to Rs 25,000 after the move was criticised by the industry and political parties. The tax was introduced to check black money.

 General Motors rolls out incentives

 Detroit, June 1 (Reuters): General Motors, suffering from a protracted slump in its US sales, will announce on Wednesday that the same discounts on GM vehicles available to its employees will now be offered to the general public, dealer sources said.

 The new consumer incentives programme is aimed at trimming bloated inventories of unsold cars and trucks, and reversing the decline in sales and market share that prompted GM to report a massive $1.1 billion loss in the first quarter.

 GM, the worlds largest automaker, has led Detroits price war since it launched interest-free loans to draw customers into showrooms after the attacks of September 11, 2001. 

 Ford SUVs

 Ford Motor said on Wednesday it has raised cash incentives on some slow-selling vehicles, including mid-size and large sports utility vehicles, to reduce swollen inventories.

 The new rebates from Ford, which range from $500 to $1,000, cover its Explorer and Expedition SUVs, the Ranger pickup truck and the Focus sedan, the automaker said.

 Ford is also offering interest-free financing for terms of up to 60 months on the two SUVs, spokesman Dave Reuter said.

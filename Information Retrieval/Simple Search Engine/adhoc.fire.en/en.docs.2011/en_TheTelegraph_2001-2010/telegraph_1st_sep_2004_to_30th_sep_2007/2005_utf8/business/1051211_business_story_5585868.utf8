 New Delhi, Dec. 10: The subscriber base for telephony services swelled to 120 million in November and the tele-density reached 11 per cent.

 Although broadband connections with less than 256 kilo bits per second download speed continued to grow since the beginning of the year, it is unlikely to reach the target set by the government. 

 At the end of November, total broadband connections in the country was only 7.50 lakh against a target of 30-lakh connections set in the Broadband Policy-2004. 

 For meeting the targets, the government has to bring in more tax rebates and sops for those setting up broadband networks in rural areas, Trai sources said. 

 The mobile and fixed-line segments recorded a substantial growth with the addition of 3.5 million mobile users and 3.80 million fixed-line subscribers. 

 In November, 3.79 million subscribers were added compared with 3.24 million subscribers last month. During the first eight months of 2005-06, about 21.50 million subscribers have been added, Trai said. 

 In the mobile segment, 3.51 million subscribers were added in November against 2.90 million in October. Of this, GSM operators added 2.33 million subscribers and CDMA 1.18 million. In October, there were 2.11 million new GSM and 0.79 million CDMA users. 

 During the first eight months, about 19.24 million mobile subscribers were added, taking the total to 71.46 million at the end of November.

 In the fixed-line segment, 0.28 million subscribers were added in November, predominantly in the wireless in local loop-fixed category. The total subscriber base of fixed-line users stood at 48.47 million in November. 

 In November, tele-density has touched 11 per cent compared with 10.66 per cent in the previous month.

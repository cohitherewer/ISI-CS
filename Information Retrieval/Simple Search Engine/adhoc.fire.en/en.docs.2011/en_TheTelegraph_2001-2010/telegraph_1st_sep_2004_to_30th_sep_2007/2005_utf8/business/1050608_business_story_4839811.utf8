 New Delhi, June 7: Two-wheeler major Kinetic Motor Company Limited is expected to turn around this year. Its sister concern Kinetic Engineering Limited (KEL) is, however, likely to achieve the feat next year.

 Kinetic Motors is expected to gross revenues of around Rs 400 crore with a sales target of 1.50 lakh scooters this year. With this in mind, we expect the company to turn around this year, KEL joint managing director Sulajja Firodia Motwani said.

 We are aiming at a 30 per cent growth in scooter sales this year, both domestic and exports combined. We expect the Nova model to be the main growth driver at about 50,000 units, followed by Zing at about 40,000 units and the rest of the models from the Italjet range, she said.

 The company introduced the Italjet range of seven gearless scooters. For this purpose, the company had bought the manufacturing and selling rights from Italian two-wheeler maker Italjet.

 She, however, declined to disclose the amount paid to Italjet for acquiring the rights. 

 The first range of scooters is likely to hit the markets in the next two months, while the second one will be launched during Diwali. The scooters are expected to be priced between Rs 25,000 and Rs 1 lakh.

 The company will have 40 new dealers across India to sell the Italjet range of scooters. We have brought in this range not only for the Indian market but also for the export markets, including Europe. The products will be manufactured in India, said Motwani.

 In addition, three models will be launched for the export market this year.

 On the motorcycle front, Motwani said KEL would introduce two variants of its existing models ? Boss and Velocity ? this year. With the auto components business picking up, KEL is expected to turn around next year. We invested Rs 200 crore in the company, she said. 

 At present, KEL is doing auto components business worth Rs 70-80 crore, she added. The company also unveiled its new corporate logo for all its two wheelers.

 Banks breathe easy on I-T sop

 Calcutta, Feb. 20: Public sector banks are unlikely to be impacted by the expiry of the sunset clause in the Income Tax (I-T) Act on March 31. Under this clause, banks enjoyed an income tax deduction of up to 10 per cent on their provisions for non-performing assets (NPAs).

 Section 36 (I) (vii-a) of the I-T act, introduced in 2002, was close-ended and is due to expire on March 31.

 Bankers said with the expiry of the sunset clause, the earlier regime of 5 per cent tax deduction on NPA provisions will come into force.

 However, observers said most of the PSU banks are already taking exemption under another provision of section 36, which provides for tax deductions of 10 per cent on aggregate rural lending and 7.5 per cent of the profit from agricultural lending.

 As a result, only a few banks would be impacted by the sunset clause, they added.

 A handful of PSU banks and their new-generation private-sector counterparts with low farm loans are likely to be impacted.

 This is partly because most public sector banks have a large farm-lending asset base, which they have expanded over the last three years to take advantage of the clause. For most public sector banks, agricultural lending comprises a substantial chunk under the priority sector advances. 

 Farm lending has outstripped retail to become the fastest growing segment. Farm loans have jumped this year by over 24 per cent.

 Bankers said their tax liability would increase on the basis of the loan recoveries in the current financial year. The average recovery of past NPAs is expected to be at least Rs 400 crore each this year.

 This figure alone is expected to substantially help in boosting the bottomlines of the banks, though this would also simultaneously contribute towards escalating the tax liability. Many bankers have now switched to farm lending, and are rapidly pushing up advances to help bring down their tax liabilities.

 Average credit deposit ratios of banks were currently about 64 per cent. Most banks were increasingly lending from their recoveries to the farm sector to set off some of their tax liabilities.

 Bankers have also moved the finance ministry to seek deferral of the sunset clause. This is necessary since a couple of PSU banks still fall short of the industry average of NPA coverage ratios.

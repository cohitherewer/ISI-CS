 Mobile firms move tribunal for justice

 New Delhi, April 30: Cellular mobile operators have moved the Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) against the new charge that will force them to pay 50 per cent of the revenue generated from international roaming subscribers to state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL).

 Seven cellular operators ? Aircel Ltd, BPL Mobile Cellular Ltd, Bharti Cellular Ltd, Idea Cellular Ltd, Hutchison Essar Mobile Services Ltd, Spice Communications Private Ltd, Reliance Telecom Ltd ? and the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) have filed a petition against the order issued by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.

 They have argued that the charge will raise the cost of their services.

 Cellular operators had alleged that the Trai order was issued without going through a transparent consultation process and without giving telecom operators an opportunity to air their views.

 The operators have also said the regulator had issued the order after BSNL started implementing the interconnection user charge (IUC) regulation as part of the revised access deficit charge (ADC) payable by the operators for various kinds of calls made by their subscribers.

 ADC is a levy that operators pay to offset the deficit that fixed-line operators incur by offering services in rural and other inaccessible areas below cost to meet certain social obligations.

 When this was pointed out to the telecom regulator, the mobile operators alleged that the regulator did not give an audience for the same.

 COAI director general T.V Ramchandran said, ?Without giving any opportunity of hearing, Trai issued a new definition of national and international roaming. This new definition imposed ADC on calls on which otherwise under the IUC Regulation of 2005 no ADC was payable.?

 COAI also said since the introduction of the ADC regime, the regulator has issued three consultation papers and at no instance has the question of redefining calls arisen or been discussed.

 ICICI arm to fund DRL quest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 28: ICICI Venture has signed a $56-million agreement with Dr Reddy?s Laboratories (DRL) wherein it will fund development and commercialisation of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs). This is a first such deal in the domestic pharmaceutical industry. 

 An abbreviated application contains data that clears the way for the final approval of a generic drug by the US FDA. These applications are called abbreviated as the companies are not required to include preclinical and clinical data to establish the effectiveness of the drug.

 According to the agreement, ICICI Venture will fund the development, registration and legal costs related to commercialisation of ANDAs on a pre-determined basis. 

 The company will fund $22.5 million in the first phase with an option to invest another $33.5 million in the second phase.

 The rationale behind this agreement is the huge opportunity that awaits domestic drug companies in the US, a senior official from ICICI Venture said.

 ?Close to $40 billion of drugs are coming off patent,? he said. The company chose Dr Reddy?s after looking at its expertise, research and marketing capabilities.

 The agreement covers most of the ANDAs to be filed by Dr Reddy?s during 2004-05 and 2005-06. On commercialisation of these products, Dr Reddy?s will pay ICICI Venture royalty on net sales for a period of five years.

 G. V. Prasad, chief executive officer of Dr Reddy?s, said while more than 30 products will be covered under the partnership, a few products will be launched in a year from now. The launch date for the remaining drugs will depend on patent expiries and litigations in some cases.

 ?This model will enable us to share the product development costs while leveraging our global scale and infrastructure,? Prasad said.

 Renuka Ramnath, managing director and chief executive officer of ICICI Venture, said the venture fund management company always decides on its partner carefully and it will not ?meddle? with the business once this investment was done. 

 She added that while the partnership was a new concept of R amp;D risk capital funding in India, Dr Reddy?s commitment to research will make the agreement successful and mutually beneficial.

 Prasad said the company was not averse to similar partnerships for new chemical entities, though there were no such possibilities in the offing immediately. Dr Reddy?s, which is known as an R amp;D focussed company, as of late been witness to numerous reverses.

Tata Metaliks mulls steel-making foray

Kharagpur, Feb. 26: Tata Metaliks Ltd is considering 

foray into steel making.

Tata Metaliks chairman T. Mukherjee said the company 

has applied for land from the Bengal government for the proposed diversification.

?It is a single-product company at present, even as 

we customise our products. As a long-term vision, Tata Metaliks wants to get into 

manufacturing of long products,? Mukherjee said.

Tata Metaliks plans to source sponge iron and mix 

it with the liquid iron produced by it to manufacture long products like billets.

Billets, a semi-finished steel, are used to produce 

structurals and TMT bars used in the construction industry. For instance, Tata 

Steel had sourced 100,000 tonnes of billets last year.

Mukherjee did not elaborate on the capacity and investment, 

saying it was still at the concept stage.

Managing director Harsh K. Jha, however, said the 

final plan would take shape by the next fiscal. ?We will take it to the board 

for approval in the next few months,? he said.

Industry observers said half-a-million tonnes could 

be a viable capacity to start.

The move by Tata Metaliks to enter steel production 

does not come as a surprise, even as Tata Steel, the company?s promoter, is the 

largest private sector steel maker in India.

?Going forward, Tata Steel intends to concentrate 

more into value-added products like cold-rolled items having higher margin. So 

two companies could well be operating into different segments of the value chain,? 

they said.

Tata Metaliks is a low-cost producer of pig iron. 

The demand for foundry-grade pig iron in the country is robust and the company 

is going through the upside of the commodity cycle.

Given the robust demand, Tata Metaliks is expecting 

a price realisation of Rs 15,000-16,000 per tonne.

It will also double the capacity to 320,000 tonnes 

from 163,000 tonnes following the start of second blast furnace.

The furnace was inaugurated by Bengal chief minister 

Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in the presence of state commerce and industry minister 

Nirupam Sen.

The chief minister promised all assistance to Tata 

Metaliks as well as the group as a whole in the state. ?Give me what are the requirements 

from the government and our officers will see to it,? he said.

Noting the renewed interest of the group, which is 

building a coke oven plant at Haldia and a cancer research hospital in Calcutta, 

Bhattacharjee said the Tata group?s investment will encourage more people to set 

up industries in the state.

Sen lauded the role of Tata Metaliks to develop the 

Kharagpur region as an industrial area. ?A number of industries are coming up 

here. We see a great potential for downstream iron and steel industry in west 

Midnapur district,? he added.

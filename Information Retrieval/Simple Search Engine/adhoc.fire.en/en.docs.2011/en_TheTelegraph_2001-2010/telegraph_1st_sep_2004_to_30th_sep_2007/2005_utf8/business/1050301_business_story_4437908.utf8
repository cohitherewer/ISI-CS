 Bank reforms gain new currency

 SUGATO HAZRA 

 Banking sector reforms have entered the fast track. Foreign banks can now convert their branches into wholly-owned subsidiaries. They may also set up such subsidiaries or acquire 74 per cent equity in a private bank. Only one such route is available till 2009. Earlier, the voting right for shareholders was pegged at 10 per cent irrespective of the quantum of holding. Now the cap of 10 per cent goes. There is a small rider. Only private banks identified for restructuring by the RBI are available for acquisitions by foreign banks.

 What Narasimhan committee reports could not do, P. Chidambaram has done at last. He had laid the foundation for the reorganisation of state-run banks a week before the budget. Now, the RBI has come out with a roadmap for foreign banks and ownership of private banks in the country. The undercurrent theme is ?competition, consolidation and convergence? to enable Indian banks to reach the Top 20 globally.

 The government will soon introduce amendments to the Banking Regulation Act 1949 and the Reserve Bank of India Act 1934. Thus, the lower and upper ceilings of statutory liquidity ratio (money banks are compelled to keep in specified government securities) and also of cash reserve ratio (money banks must keep as deposit with the RBI) will go. Banks will get the freedom to issue preference shares ? this may eventually act as a preferred route for acquisition of banks. The rigid banking structure in the country is now in for an overhaul.

 But this does not mean that banks can escape the populist pressures from the politicians. The finance minister has directed public sector banks to add another 50 lakh agricultural borrowers. Co-operative banks, regional rural banks and commercial banks must increase the flow of credit by another 30 per cent for the vote-bank sector. 

 The government is aware of the precarious financial health of the co-operative banks. There has to be now special financial assistance to such banks to wipe out losses. How much the present diktats will lead to writing off in future remains to be ascertained by some other government.

 Or maybe loan administration will be efficient now with the emphasis on the self-help groups working in micro-finance activities. The government wants to encourage micro-finance institutions. The budget has, therefore, set aside Rs 200 crore for the Micro Finance Development and Equity Fund. The RBI will allow external commercial borrowing for these institutions. All the bankers have to do is to identify the prospective micro-finance institutions. The question that remains unanswered is what if such identification process remains as efficient as it has been, leading to the current state of India?s banking sector.

 While micro finance is meant for small borrowers, there will be a new Development Finance Institute in the garb of a special purpose vehicle (SPV). The proposed SPV will finance infrastructure projects, will have access to Rs 10,000 crore to begin with during the current year and may buy from the forex reserves to fund import content of such infrastructure projects.

 Whether the proposed changes can deliver the much awaited banking sector reform or not, nobody ? not even the harshest critic ? can fault the Union finance minister and his dream team for not dreaming innovatively.

 Super-cop ready for rogue hunt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Damodaran: Action man

 Mumbai, Feb. 18: Myleveetil Damodaran hit the ground running as the new Sebi chief with a warning that he will come down with a ?swift and heavy? hand against entities and individuals indulging in market misconduct.

 Having taken over charge from predecessor G. N. Bajpai this morning, Damodaran appeared realistic in his first press conference as the new super-cop of bourses when he said he would ?minimise mischief? in the stock market. ?Nobody can totally eliminate it,? he added.

 He lavished praise on Bajpai, whom he described as a friend and an administrator who raised the bar for regulators. The former Sebi chief, seated next to him, grinned.

 Damodaran said his effort would be to create an environment where investors prosper under laws that help them make informed decisions about money. 

 Asked about the quality of regulation, Damodaran said it was good enough. This was reflected in the way the capital market was run in the country. Sebi, on its part too, was an ?orderly and structured organisation?, he added.

 Sounding optimistic about the market, Damodaran conceded there was scope to improve regulation and institutional mechanisms to protect the interest of investors. He would not elaborate, saying it was too early to do so.

 Asked how he would characterise current market conditions, he said: ?Sometimes fires can burn, but at times, it can warm. He believed the latter was true at this point.

 Bajpai, who passed on the baton to Damodaran after three years as helmsman of the capital market regulator, said he had a fulfilling experience. ?There were times we felt happy and times when we felt anxious.?

 Responding to the controversy over making Mapin cards obligatory, Damodaran said he did not see why it should lead to such a row. ?I am among the first to register.?

 Number nightmare numbs AIG affiliate

 JENNY ANDERSON 

 New York, April 4: The 

 Starr International Co, a private holding company that owns 

 12 per cent of American International Group and a compensation 

 vehicle for AIG executives and employees, is contemplating 

 breaking up with AIG, a person briefed on the company?s 

 plans said. 

 Regulators, including the Securities 

 and Exchange Commission, the New York Attorney-General?s 

 office and the New York state Insurance Department are investigating 

 AIG for transactions and relationships with firms that might 

 have allowed it to dress up its financial condition. 

 Separating the two companies could 

 alleviate concerns that Maurice R. Greenberg, who was forced 

 out of AIG because of investigations, might be able to use 

 his control at Starr International as a director to wield 

 power over his former company. If Starr formally separated 

 from AIG, Greenberg would cease to have power over the long-term 

 compensation of AIG officials. 

 Last week, all current AIG officers 

 and directors were removed from the Starr International 

 board and replaced with people not affiliated with AIG, 

 this person said. Greenberg, who is neither an officer nor 

 a director at AIG, is the president and chairman of C.V. 

 Starr, another privately owned insurance company. 

 Starr International, which was 

 located in a joint office with AIG in Bermuda, has relocated 

 its offices. The long-term relationship between Starr International, 

 C.V. Starr and AIG remains unclear. 

 Richard Beattie, who represents 

 the AIG board, said there was no proposal on the table. 

 David Boies, a lawyer representing Starr International, 

 C.V. Starr and Greenberg, declined to comment. C.V. Starr 

 does business with AIG and also distributes compensation 

 to its 80 partners, who are top AIG executives. 

 AIG?s relationship with both Starr 

 International and C.V. Starr are under scrutiny because 

 of their close ties. 

 Under consideration, according 

 to the person with knowledge of Starrs plans, over 

 the long term, AIG would take over the role Starr International 

 plays in doling out long-term compensation for AIG directors 

 and officers. Since 2001, Starr International has paid $270 

 million, before taxes, in long-term compensation to senior 

 AIG executives.

 According to these plans, Starr 

 International would set aside funds for any commitments 

 already made; and future payments would be determined by 

 AIG. 

 Chris Winans, a company spokesman 

 for AIG, declined to comment. 

 The discussions also contemplated 

 various options for the future of C.V. Starr, which does 

 brokerage work with AIG. The brokerage operations could 

 be sold for fair market value to a third party or folded 

 into AIG in a more formal manner, the person said. 

 Last week, a showdown erupted 

 over control of documents at the shared AIG-Starr International 

 facilities. A lawyer from Boies office was supervising 

 the removal of Starr documents when AIG lawyers alerted 

 regulators that boxes were being carted out of the site. 

 The New York attorney general, 

 Eliot Spitzer, immediately threatened to take action against 

 AIG for obstruction of justice. By the end of the weekend, 

 the company confirmed that one AIG employee had been fired 

 for failing to cooperate in the broader investigation, while 

 lawyers representing both AIG and Starr International worked 

 out a deal with regulators by which the documents would 

 be removed to a separate, secure site. 

 Because of the close nature of 

 the two companies and their previously shared office space, 

 lawyers have been sparring over who has control over what 

 documents.

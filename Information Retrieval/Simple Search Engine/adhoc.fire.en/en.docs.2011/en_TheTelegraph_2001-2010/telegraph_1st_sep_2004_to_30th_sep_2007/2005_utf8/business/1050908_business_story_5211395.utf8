 Microsoft takes EU trade cop to court 

 LEGAL Wrangle

 Brussels, Sept. 7 (Reuters): Microsoft has filed a lawsuit against the European Commission in a European Union court, the latest wrangle in its long-running battle against competition authorities in Brussels.

 Microsoft has filed an application for annulment with the Court of First Instance specifically concerning the issue of broad licences for the source code of communications protocols, a company spokesman said.

 The issue relates to server software, which runs printing, filing and security tasks for small office groups. 

 The commission was expected to comment at its regular midday briefing.

 The commission imposed sanctions against the software giant, including a record 497 million-euro fine, in March 2004 in a case, which also covered the bundling of Microsofts Media Player with Windows, but the company has not entirely carried them out.

 Microsoft challenged the commissions decision ? a case which has yet to go to hearing ? and, separately, tried without success to get the sanctions suspended by the court. Competition commissioner Neelie Kroes had warned Microsoft it had to comply by June 1, 2005, or face new enforcement action.

 Microsoft filed a compliance agreement by the deadline. But it managed to soften a remedy, which required it to share communications protocols ? software rules of the road ? with all rival makers of server software for small offices. Essentially, the commission and Microsoft agreed that those who received the protocols could not make them public. The makers of open-source server software, who publish the source codes for all products they issue, cried foul at this, however, and Microsoft and the commission decided to leave the issue to the Court of First Instance.

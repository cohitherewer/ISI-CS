The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 P amp;G detergent deal valued at Rs 101 cr 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 11: Procter amp; Gamble Hygiene and Healthcare Ltd will get Rs 101 crore from the sale of its detergent manufacturing business to Procter amp; Gamble Home Products Ltd. Both the companies are fully-owned subsidiaries of Procter amp; Gamble Co (P amp;G), USA.

 The board of Procter amp; Gamble Hygiene today cleared the deal. The company will transfer the land, building, plant, machinery and other assets at its Mandideep plant in Madhya Pradesh to Procter amp; Gamble Home Products. 

 P amp;G Hygiene said the deal-value includes Rs 38 crore for tangible and intangible assets of the detergent manufacturing plant and Rs 62 crore for the inventory of raw material and finished goods. The inventory, however, might vary according to the stock at hand and the date of transfer, the company added.

 The sale will not have a significant impact on its profits, P amp;G Hygiene said.

 The transfer via sale will reduce complexities and ensure that each company is focussed on its core categories. P amp;G Hygiene will invest the Rs 101-crore cash in its core business and augment the companys distributable profits, said Bharat Patel, non-executive chairman of P amp;G Hygiene.

 P amp;G Hygiene will also transfer its employees along with the severance liability to P amp;G Home, which will protect the present terms and conditions of employment of these employees.

 As the deal is between two subsidiaries of Procter amp; Gamble, the company has taken three steps to arrive at a fair value for transfer of the detergent manufacturing business. 

 It has obtained an item-wise market valuation of assets of its detergent plant from Radbin Consultants Pvt Ltd, a consultant and valuer. Further, it obtained a fair valuation of the detergent business from Bansi S. Mehta amp; Co, chartered accountants. P amp;G Hygiene has also taken into account the opinion of merchant banker Lazard India Pvt Ltd.

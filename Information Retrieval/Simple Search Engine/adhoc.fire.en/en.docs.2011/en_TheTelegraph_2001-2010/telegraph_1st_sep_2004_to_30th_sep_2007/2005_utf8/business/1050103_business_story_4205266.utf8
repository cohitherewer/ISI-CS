 Jharkhand breather for Hind Copper

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Looking forward

 Calcutta, Jan. 2: The Jharkhand government has given a breather to Hindustan Copper, a central public sector undertaking, by taking over the townships at the company?s abandoned mines at Mosaboni and Rakha near Ghatsila.

 Talking to The Telegraph, Rana Som, chairman and managing director of Hindustan Copper, said, ?There are four mines in Mosaboni and one in Rakha. The mines had been abandoned. But we had to carry on with the townships and were incurring an expenditure of Rs 7-8 crore. We had asked the Jharkhand government to take over the townships three years ago. After a long wait, they have finally taken them over giving us the much needed relief.?

 The state government has also benefited from the move. Hind Copper will set off Rs 64 crore dues of the Jharkhand government against taking over of these townships. ?Our liabilities will also come down. We are also keeping a close vigil on our expenditure,? said Som.

 Hind Copper, whose accumulated loss stands at Rs 805 crore, is striving hard to retire the high-cost borrowings.

 The company has approached Allahabad Bank for a loan of Rs 67 crore with a coupon rate of 7 per cent to retire its debentures, which carry an interest rate of 14 per cent. ?We have to clear our balancesheet as fast as we can,? Som said.

 The company started suffering heavy losses from 1996-97. In 2002-03, the total accumulated loss stood at Rs 866 crore. 

 The central government had offered two restructuring packages to the company to keep its net worth positive. 

 Both the packages were aimed at converting the loans to equity and offering voluntary retirement to employees. As a result, the company?s equity had bloated up. The paid-up capital now stands at Rs 741 crore. Hind Copper is planning to enter the capital market with an initial public offer to reduce the capital base.

 The company is planning to bring down the interest payout from Rs 3.2 crore per month at present to Rs 2.5 crore from next year.

 Hind Copper has already availed of the Rs 100-crore limit of letter of credit and Rs 160 crore cash credit. It had issued Rs 250-crore government bonds and Rs 85-crore non-government bonds and debentures. 

 ?These bonds and debentures carry a 14-14.5 per cent coupon rate, which put pressure on our financials,? Som added.

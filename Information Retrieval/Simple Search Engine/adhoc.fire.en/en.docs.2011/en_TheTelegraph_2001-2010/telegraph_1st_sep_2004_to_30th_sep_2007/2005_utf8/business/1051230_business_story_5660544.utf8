 CERC plan to break grid-lock

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Power for all

 New Delhi, Dec. 29: The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) has issued the revised Indian Electricity Grid Code with an emphasis on grid security and energy balancing among the five electrical regions in the country ? east, west, north, south and northeast. 

 Indian Electricity Grid Code (IEGC) lays down the rules to be followed by various agencies to plan, develop, maintain and operate the power system. The revised IEGC will come into force from April 1. It is expected to facilitate beneficial trading of electricity by defining a common basis of operation of the inter-state transmission system applicable to all users.

 In order to improve grid voltages, the revised code proposes to apply reactive energy charges at 5 paise per unit of reactive power on power flows on all inter-state transmission lines. The rate shall be escalated by 5 per cent every year thereafter. 

 Senior member of CERC said, This will not have any impact on the consumer rates or wheeling charges. It is a technical calculation for the additional power used to push the electricity on the grid called reactive energy. The transmission companies can also benefit from this if they manage the reactive power.

 Under the revised code, the regional load despatch centres would henceforth issue the regional energy accounts. 

 Earlier these accounts were issued by the regional electricity boards, which are in the process of being replaced by the regional power committees according to the directives of the ministry of power. 

 Once the reorganisation of state electricity boards is completed, a large number of independent entities (generating firms, transmission licensees and distribution licensees) will emerge in each state.

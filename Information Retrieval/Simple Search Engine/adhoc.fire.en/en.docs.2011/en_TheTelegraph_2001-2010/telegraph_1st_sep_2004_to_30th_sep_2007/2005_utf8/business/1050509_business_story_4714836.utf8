 PSU banks to step up bad loan recoveries

 Calcutta, May 8: Most of the public sector banks in the country have set a target of recovering non-performing assets worth Rs 200-250 crore this fiscal.

 The ambitious target is based on the good recoveries made in the last financial year. The manufacturing sector has turned around and there is an overall growth in the economy, the bankers said.

 ?The trend has encouraged bankers to set an ambitious target for recovering delinquent loans,? said a senior State Bank official.

 Moreover, banking officials added there was little NPA accretion during the last fiscal. On incremental basis, the provisioning for bad loans had reached international levels, bankers said.

 The banks also expect to perform better in 2005-06. 

 ?The NPA recoveries have been fully provided. Consequently, the recoveries of the principal would become part of capital reserves. Interest and penal receipts will form part of the profit and loss account and be treated as extraordinary income. These elements would beef up both the capital as well as the incomes of the banks,? said a senior Allahabad Bank official. 

 At the same time, bankers said the NPA coverage ratios would rise to above 75 per cent for the entire banking sector, although in some cases it would be as high as 90 per cent. 

 NPA coverage ratio reflects the quantum of bank provisions as part of the non-performing loans. 

 Along with recovery efforts, most of the banks had shown non-food credit growth in excess of 30 per cent. Along with the low NPA provisions, credit growth was a substantial driver of profit, bankers said. 

 For the last four years, treasuries had driven bank profits. But treasury income in 2004-05 was substantially low. 

 Bankers do not expect good returns from treasury operations due to a steep rise in yields of all government securities this fiscal. 

 As a result, they have lost interest in treasury and have returned to core operations to generate profit. In fact, core operations are expected to sustain profit well into this year, bankers said. 

 This loss of interest in G-sec trading was evident from the narrowing spread between G-sec yields and the interest rates on credits. 

 Besides, none of the major banks have altered their benchmark prime lending rates, which is hovering between 10.5 per cent and 11.5 per cent. Most banks, however, were lending to top-rated companies at sub-PLR.

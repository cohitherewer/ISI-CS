 United Western rating 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 15: Rating agency CARE today downgraded the subordinated bond issue of United Western Bank (UWB) from BBB+ to BB+ as the banks capital adequacy ratio last fiscal had slid below the minimum regulatory requirement owing to operational losses.

 The Tier II (debt capital) subordinate bond issue, which aims at mobilising Rs 134.70 crore, is considered to be speculative with inadequate protection for interest and principal payments by CARE.

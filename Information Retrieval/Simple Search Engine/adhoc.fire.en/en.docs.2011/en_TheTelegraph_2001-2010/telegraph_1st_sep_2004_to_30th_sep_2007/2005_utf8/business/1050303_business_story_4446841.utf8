 Move to make co-op banks transparent

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 2: To increase transparency among urban co-operative banks (UCBs), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will make public details of penalties and strictures or directions on these banks. The UCBs will also have to disclose any penalties imposed on their notes on accounts in the annual reports.

 The central bank initiative comes after its direction in 2002 asking UCBs with deposits of Rs 100 crore and above to disclose certain information regarding capital adequacy ratio and non-performing assets as notes on accounts to their balancesheet.

 The RBI is empowered to impose penalties on a primary (urban) co-operative bank under 47(A) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, for contraventions of any provision of the act or non-compliance with any other requirements specified by the Reserve Bank. The imposition of penalty is decided after a due process of advising the bank and seeking its explanation.

 ?Disclosure of the details of the levy of penalty on a bank in public domain will be in the interest of the members and depositors,? the central bank said in a notification issued yesterday. 

 It also said strictures or directions on the basis of inspection reports or other adverse findings will be now made public.

 Regarding the mode of disclosure of penalties, the RBI added that it will issue details of the circumstances under which a penalty is imposed on the bank along with a communication on the imposition of penalty.

 It also asked the banks to disclose the penalty in the notes on accounts to its balancesheet in the next annual report.

 According to the RBI, this policy will come into effect from March 1.

 The joint parliamentary committee (JPC) on stock market scam had recommended that the comments made by the RBI in the inspection reports of banks should be published in the annual reports along with the financial results to ensure greater transparency. This will give shareholders a better idea about the operations of the bank. 

 The RBI said in view of the sensitive nature of the disclosures and their impact on the interest of depositors, the JPC recommendations were examined in consultation with the Standing Technical Advisory Committee on Financial Regulation and the Board for Financial Supervision.

 The central bank said the Basel II norms also suggested the ways through which safety and soundness of the banking system could be strengthened by market discipline through enhanced transparency in the bank?s disclosures to the public.

 While it is internationally recognised that even as transparency strengthens market discipline, banks may not be able to disclose all data that may be relevant to assess its risk profile because of the inherent need to preserve confidentiality for its customers. 

 ?Therefore, in any policy of transparency, there is a need to build processes which ensure that the benefits of supervisory disclosure are appropriately weighed against the risk to all stakeholders of non-disclosure in each instance,? it added.

 However, the central bank felt that while there could be considerable risks and judgements involved in the disclosure of information obtained by the supervisor, there is significant merit in adopting a policy of transparency for statutory penalties levied and other specific supervisory actions.

 More banks pick up stake in credit bureau

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 16: SBI and HDFC have sold a part of their stakes in Credit Information Bureau India Limited (Cibil) to a clutch of Indian and foreign banks that are expected to share a lot of the information they have on borrowers.

 ICICI Bank, Punjab National Bank, Bank of India, Central Bank of India, Union Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Citibank, HSBC and Sundaram Finance are the new entrants.

 Cibil chairman S. Santhanakrishnan said the dispersed shareholding and wider participation by credit providers in his firm would leave an impact on the financial sector.

 Earlier, State Bank of India and HDFC owned 40 per cent each of the credit information firm, while Dun amp; Bradstreet Information Services and Trans Union International held 10 per cent each. The overseas companies provided Cibil technical and software support.

 The stake churn follows statements made by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its monetary and credit policy for 2004-05 where it called for Cibils equity to be widely held. The objective should be to move towards a sufficiently diversified ownership with no single entity owning more than 10 per cent of the paid-up capital in the first stage and 5 per cent later, the RBI had said.

 ICICI Bank, the largest private sector bank in the country, will hold 10 per cent in Cibil. Punjab National Bank, Bank of India, Central Bank of India, Union Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Citibank and HSBC will each control 5 per cent of the equity. Sundaram Finance gets 2.5 per cent.

 Cibil launched consumer bureau operations last year with a database of 4 million records from 12 members. It now has 20 million records from 30 members.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Celebrity parade for the poor

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hong Kong, Dec. 12: Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, former Irish president Mary Robinson, west African singer Angelique Kidjo and Mexican actor Gach Garica Bernal. What binds them for a cause? They have all descended at the convention centre to join a swelling phalanx of WTO baiters who believe the talks will starve the poor nations of their fair share while the rich feast.

 As the Hong Kong police struggled to keep the raucous dissenters at bay, the line-up of celebrities stepped up their campaign against what they called was an exploitative multilateral trade order now in the works.

 Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia university, is delivering a series of lectures at the foreign correspondents club here to highlight the unequal nature of trade agreements sought to be foisted on the poor.

 Robinson, the head of Oxfam, criticised the draft of the WTO ministerial. Singer Kidjo is lending his voice to echo the cause of the least developed countries and highlight the raw deal the African cotton farmers are getting. He tears WTO chief Pascal Lamys cotton dossier to shreds.

 Protest spill-over

 These are tough days for Hong Kong police, which had to battle with a throng of 3,000-4,000 activists lunging towards the convention centre. Attired in their immaculate blue uniforms with ties to match, toting state-of-the-art pistols and wireless sets, the cops moved with clinical efficiency to keep the venue clear of vandals. 

 Lam Sair Ping, a Chinese journalist covering the event for a local daily, said security in the area had never been so tight. Even sportsmen from a nearby stadium are staying home and a busy ferry service is closed to the public.

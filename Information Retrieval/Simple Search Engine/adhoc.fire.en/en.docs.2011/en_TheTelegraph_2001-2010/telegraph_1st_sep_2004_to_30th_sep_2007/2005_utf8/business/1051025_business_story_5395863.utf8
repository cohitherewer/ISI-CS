 Hot wheels: Indians in a hurry to change 

 GARIMA SINGH

 Use and throw?

 New Delhi, Oct. 24: Women may rage when they hear this, but a man?s greatest passion is his car. 

 Even this passion is becoming very transitory and, in a world where nothing is for keeps, Indian car-owners are dumping their old cars sooner than carmakers are rolling out newer models.

 The car replacement cycle in India ? where male drivers outnumber females by a ratio of 10 to 1 ? has shrunk to about two to three years, bringing us on a par with the developing world.

 If you have been driving the same car for the last six years, you are probably part of a fast-shrinking minority.

 Nearly 60 per cent car-owners have already replaced their cars by this time. Over one-third of car-owners are replacing theirs within the first three to four years of ownership.

 This is against a minimum of six to seven years that usually owners take to replace their cars, says a recent JD Power SSI study.

 The growth in new car sales seems to have found an unlikely catalyst in pre-owned cars through the exchange offers that most carmakers now offer.

 For example, Maruti Udyog?s exchange scheme provides a similar opportunity to customers. Car-owners can exchange their old cars (under True Value) for a new car without having to pay anything extra.

 This is how it works. The value of the old car works as the down payment for the new car that is being purchased. In the event of an outstanding loan, the same is adjusted with the new loan. With interest rates on car loans starting to moderate, the new EMI is almost on a par with what the customer was paying earlier.

 In effect, one can now drive in with one?s existing car and drive out with a brand new vehicle.

 According to the study, the number of years the customers retain their cars is coming down, with over 30 per cent of them replacing their cars soon.

 ?Competition from manufacturers is delivering more value for customers. Also, greater purchasing power and easy finance options are making this revolution possible,? said Hemant Luthra, president of Mahindra Systems and Automotive Technologies (MSAT).

 Mahindra amp; Mahindra Limited?s Automart offers a unique buy and sell scheme. While a car seller can get his car (any make) valued and immediately get paid for it, a buyer purchases a vehicle which is certified by M amp;M.

 ?Falling interest rates and easy availability of finance seem to be the driving force behind customers going in for quicker upgradation through car exchange,? said a Maruti official.

 For example, buying a Maruti Zen in the year 2000 would have meant an EMI of Rs 6,795. If one were to exchange it with a new Zen today, the EMI would be a meagre Rs 2,850.

 Similarly, the EMI for a Maruti 800 in the year 2000 equals the EMI for a WagonR under the exchange scheme today.

 Jan date for NTPC case

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 23: Bombay High Court has adjourned till January 30 the petition filed by National Thermal Power Corporation seeking an ad interim relief against Reliance Industries Ltd for not signing the gas sales and purchase agreement and praying for execution of the contract according to the bid. 

 Even today there was no breakthrough. Since yesterday, when the case came up for hearing, Justice S.F. Vajifdar has been asking both the parties to arrive at an amicable solution through communication as the matter was delicate.

 The judge adjourned the petition as Reliance sought time to file a reply. Accordingly, the ad-interim relief prayed for by NTPC, which sought an order to restrain RIL from entering into a contract with any other party, was not granted. 

 Both the entities today tried to work out modalities but could not come to a conclusion. Later, they met the judge who adjourned the hearing. 

 On Thursday, Reliance expressed concerns over the uncapped liability clause in the gas sales and purchase agreement, which it felt made the contract unviable for the company. While it has sought time to file a reply, the company has been asked to file its affidavit on January 16, a week after the court resumes following Christmas vacations. Similarly, NTPC has been allowed to file a rejoinder on January 27 and the next hearing for ad-interim relief will be on January 30.

 On Thursday, the corporation had urged the court to direct RIL not to enter into any gas supply contract with any other party. However, Reliance said its contract with any other party would not hurt NTPCs upcoming projects, as besides the gas supply contract between the two, the corporation would have the option of using the gas generated from other upcoming projects in the country.

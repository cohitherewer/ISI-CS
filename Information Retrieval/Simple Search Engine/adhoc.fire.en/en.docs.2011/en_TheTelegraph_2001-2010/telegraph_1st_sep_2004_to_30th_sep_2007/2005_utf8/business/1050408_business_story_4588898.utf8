 Calcutta, April 7: Goodricke Group Limited (GGL) will move court against the Bengal government?s decision to impose a rental (salami) of Rs 9,000 per hectare on renewal of lease in 15 tea estates.

 The state levies a lease rental if a garden changes its name or ownership. In the case of Goodricke, eight companies were amalgamated to form Goodricke Group Limited in 1978. The ownership of the company, however, did not change.

 ?Now the state wants us to pay salami with retrospective effect from 1978. The lease of some of our gardens has expired and some will lapse in the coming years. The government?s demand is illegal. So we have decided to initiate a legal battle. We will move court within a month,? said K. S. David, managing director of Goodricke.

 The state has asked the tea companies to pay the salami in 30 instalments keeping in mind their financial state. 

 The government has also decided to levy lease rental on renewal authenticated by the district collector. 

 ?The government says the collector went beyond his brief and is not eager to negotiate. Not a single tea company in Bengal has paid the lease rental till date,? he said on the sidelines of the 29th annual general meeting. 

 The company has 17 estates spread over an area of 8,000 hectares. The company is being asked to pay salami for its 15 estates in Dooars and Darjeeling. 

 Chairman P. A. Leggat said the company is aggressively focusing on packet teas through brand-building in both existing or new brands.

 Instant tea plant 

 Goodricke plans to set up an instant tea plant at its existing facility at Aibheel tea garden in North Bengal. 

 A Japanese company is keen to procure instant tea from Goodricke. Based on the demand, the company is planning to set up another instant tea plant at a cost of Rs 35 crore, in which the Japanese company may become a joint venture partner. The Japanese firm is already procuring instant tea through Marubeni.

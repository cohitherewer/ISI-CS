 Alstom T amp;D unit valued at Rs 153 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 1: The transmission and distribution (T amp;D) business of Alstom Ltd has been valued at Rs 153 crore. Alstom SA, the parent company of Alstom Ltd, had earlier announced sale of the global T amp;D business to Areva of France.

 The valuation exercise was conducted by two independent valuers ? N. M. Raji amp; Co and Bansi S. Mehta amp; Co ? who were appointed by the company board to evaluate the T amp;D business on a going concern basis.

 ?They have submitted a joint report giving a value of Rs 153 crore, which has been taken on record by the board at its meeting held on January 31,? Alstom said, while adding that the board has decided to forward this report to the parent company in France.

 Following the anti-trust clearance received from the European Commission and American antitrust agencies on the acquisition of the global T amp;D operations of the Alstom group by Areva, the transaction was close to completion. However, this did not include the T amp;D operations in India.

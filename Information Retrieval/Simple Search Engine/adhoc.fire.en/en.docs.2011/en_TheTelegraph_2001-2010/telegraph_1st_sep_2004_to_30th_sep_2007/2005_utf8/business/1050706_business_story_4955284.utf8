 India out of Swift recall shadow

 AGENCIES

 Tokyo, July 5: Suzuki is recalling about 29,000 Swift and Escudo cars in Japan to repair defects in their fuel pumping systems.

 The decision on vehicles, produced between October 2004 and May 2005, will not affect the models rolling on Indian roads. The recall will not affect cars here. The part concerned is different in case of India because it is made by another component manufacturer, said Maruti, the Indian arm of the Japanese car-maker. Around 8,000 Swift cars have been sold since its May launch.

 Suzuki said a defect in a part that pumps fuel to the engine can cause it to stop and prevent it from restarting. It stems from possible deformation of the plastic material. The firm said 30 cases of engine trouble related to the defect have been reported since March.

 Chandralekha Tulal sifts through women-specific bank schemes

 Women power is what banks are banking on. It is evident from the flurry of tailor-made products and services that has been tossed up over the past years.

 Citibank and ICICI Bank?s ?Woman?s Account?, UTI Bank?s ?Smart Privilege? and ABN Amro?s ?Shakti Account for Working Women? are some that come to mind.

 Do they really offer anything significant to a woman besides the plain vanilla account?

 Most of these are, essentially, schemes put into a single basket to make things convenient for a working woman. They are also available individually, but the likelihood of a person buying all of them would be much lower. 

 Weigh options

 Before opting for these accounts, it is better to weigh the options separately and also as part of a package.

 For instance, ABN Amro?s Shakti offers a savings account, a first-year free credit card, discounts on loans and, to top them all, special rates on insurance policies.

 UTI Bank and Citibank provide an account for your child. Citibank also offers other value-added debit cards. 

 The banks also help you to take some bold investment decisions.

 For instance, Citibank assigns you a special adviser to assess your financial needs and help you explore investment options.

 UTI Bank offers to help you with a systematic investment plan in mutual funds. Since most bankers now offer financial advice, this should not be a major reason for considering a girls-only account. 

 The Women?s Account of ICICI Bank is available only in Andhra Pradesh and comes with a specially designed recurring deposit in which the minimum amount invested is Rs 500 against the normal Rs 1,000. No tax is deducted at source. 

 In addition, for an annual premium amount of Rs 60, the account comes with a personal accident insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh (in case of surface accidents) or Rs 4 lakh (in case of air accidents). 

 If the woman is a mother, she can opt for the ?Young Star?, aimed at her children. However, all other features are the same as a savings bank account.

 Card game

 Not only accounts, Standard Chartered has also introduced a credit card called Diva, which includes features like a free annual all-womens health check-up at any of the 18 Apollo hospitals and health clinics.

 The card also offers free insurance packages for the member and her family, including an accident insurance cover for herself and spouse, a child education allowance, besides medical and purchase protection insurance. 

 It is now available to customers in Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Calcutta, Hyderabad and Pune at an annual fee of Rs 700 and an entry charge of Rs 100. 

 Citibank has also introduced the ?Woman?s Visa Mini Card?, which is small enough to fit into your palm. The card offers super discounts on various products and exclusive offers when you shop at any of its special partners. 

 Better late than never

 Even nationalised banks are reluctant to be left behind, though not many women-specific products have been introduced from their stable so far.

 Abhilasha is a welfare scheme for working women from Indian Overseas Bank. Working women drawing a monthly gross salary of Rs 2,000 and above are eligible. They are required to open a recurring deposit account for 24 months with an instalment of Rs 100 and above. After paying instalments for three months regularly, she can avail of the loan.

 United Bank of India offers a special rate on home loans if the wife joins her husband in the application. There is a discount of 0.25 per cent for non-working wives and 0.5 per cent for working wives.

 Corporation Bank also has a specially designed loan scheme called Corp Mahila Gold to finance working and non-working women who want to purchase gold bars or ornaments, which is available to resident Indian women between 18 and 58 years.

 Centurion in merger mode

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Talwar: United front

 Mumbai, June 20: The boards of Centurion Bank and Bank of Punjab today decided to clear the way for a merger.

 The directors of both banks will meet again on June 29 to consider the final terms of a deal, which will have to be preceded by due diligence, a fair share-swap ratio and, above all, a host of statutory and regulatory approvals. 

 Ambit Corporate Finance has been appointed the sole investment banker for the transaction. KPMG India Pvt Ltd and NM Raiji amp; Co will fix the swap ratio.

 Senior officials cited the forthcoming board meeting to refuse comment on the merger. However, sources said the two banks expect geographical and product synergy. 

 ?It will be a case of two good banks coming together to form a larger entity and would be a brilliant fit,? sources said. Centurion Bank is strong on retail loans, while Bank of Punjab lends largely to small units and agriculture.

 There is a geographical advantage too. The merger will create a bank with a presence in the west, north and southern regions. Centurion Bank mostly has branches in the western and southern regions, while Bank of Punjab has made deep inroads into the north of the country. 

 When merged, the two banks will have over 220 branches and a business of more than Rs 12,000 crore. Centurion Bank had Rs 3530 crore in deposits and Rs 2194 crore in loans in 2004-2005; the figures for Bank of Punjab were Rs 4136.89 crore and Rs 2228 crore respectively.

 ?Both banks have excellent franchises that will complement each other. The merged entity will be well capitalised with a strong management team and will be able to achieve considerable revenue and cost synergy. It will be a full-service commercial bank with large loans to the retail, small units and agriculture segments,? Centurion Bank chairman Rana Talwar said. 

 C. R. Sharma, managing director of Bank of Punjab, said the combined entity would be a ?good synergistic fit? in terms of product offerings and regional presence.

 Centurion Bank was reeling under losses until a group of international investors infused fresh capital into it. This lead to a management change that made Talwar the chairman and Shailendra Bhandari the managing director. 

 Centurion made a net profit of Rs 25.11 crore in 2004-05 while Bank of Punjab?s bottomline was at Rs 37 crore.

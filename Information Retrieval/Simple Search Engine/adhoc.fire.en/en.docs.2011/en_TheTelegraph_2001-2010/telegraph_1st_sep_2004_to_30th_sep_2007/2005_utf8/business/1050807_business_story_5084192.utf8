 Calcutta, Aug. 6: United Bank of India (UBI) has clocked a net profit of Rs 63.50 crore for the April-June period of the current fiscal, which is an increase of 30.8 per cent over its earnings in the corresponding period of the previous year. The bank had registered a net profit of Rs 48.56 crore for the same quarter last year. 

 The operating profit of the bank has also shown a growth of 29.45 per cent to Rs 189 crore during the reporting quarter from Rs 146 crore in the year-ago period.

 Buoyed by the improved performance, the bank is hopeful about wiping out its accumulated losses of Rs 215 crore by the turn of 2005-06.

 Addressing a press conference here today, P. K. Gupta, chairman and managing director of United Bank of India, said the banks total business, comprising deposits and advances, has increased to Rs 38,733 crore registering a growth of 22 per cent on year-on-year basis.

 While deposits during the three-month period grew by 14.06 per cent to Rs 25,898 crore compared with the same period last fiscal, the banks loan advances shot up 44.3 per cent to Rs 12,376 crore as on June 2005. The low cost deposits of the bank have risen to Rs 11,805 crore against Rs 10,169 crore recorded in the first three months of 2004-05.

 Gupta said, These low cost deposits constituted 45.6 per cent of the total deposits as in June this year compared with 44.8 per cent as in June last year. Consequently, the cost of raising deposits for us has declined from 5.12 per cent in March 2005 to 4.93 per cent in June 2005, which has made a positive impact on our operating profits for the quarter.

 The retail credit of the bank has witnessed a growth of about 83 per cent. The retail credit outstanding has gone up from Rs 1,081 crore as in June 2004 to Rs 1,972 crore as in June 2005. 

 In its retail banking portfolio, housing loans recorded the maximum growth of 90 per cent taking the disbursed loan figure from Rs 497 crore as in June 2004 to Rs 945 crore as in June 2005. 

 As a result, the credit deposit ratio of the bank has moved up to 49.6 per cent as in June 2005 as against 39.8 per cent as in June 2004.

 The quality of its loan assets had also improved in as much as that the gross non-performing assets (NPAs) had declined from 6.10 per cent as in March this year to 5.82 per cent as on June 30. Net NPAs at the end of the first three months of the current financial year stood at 2.3 per cent, while the capital adequacy ratio was recorded at a healthy 17.10 per cent against the regulatory requirement of 9 per cent.

 The bank plans to come out with an initial public offer once accumulated losses are wiped out.

 UBI has also drawn up plans to implement core banking solutions (CBS). It has earmarked Rs 100 crore investment for converting 600 branches into CBS branches by 2008.

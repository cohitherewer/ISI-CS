 Delayed rains cloud growth forecast 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 13: The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) today cut its growth forecast for the economy to 6 per cent from 6.6 per cent as it apprehended that an inadequate monsoon could adversely impact farm sector output.

 CMIE said that agriculture and allied sector output could actually fall by 0.7 per cent as against a 3.1 per cent growth projected in April this year.

 In its monthly economic review released here today, the leading economic think tank said that the south-west monsoon arrived Kerala after a delay of four-days and its progress in the following days was unsatisfactory. Forecasts of rainfall for June and July are not good either, CMIE added. 

 It further pointed out that such deficiency would damage agricultural production in the current kharif season and the production of oilseeds, wheat and rice could particularly be affected.

 The industry and service sector are, however, unlikely to be affected by the poor performance of farm and allied sector, the CMIE noted. It, therefore, maintained the growth forecast for these sectors at 8.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively.

 Observers, however, point out that it may be a little early to alter the countrys economic growth prospects for this year based on the progress of the monsoon so far. 

 This is because a clear picture of the monsoons impact (on agriculture) is expected to emanate only next month. Pending an official forecast, which is expected shortly, it is also argued that a delayed monsoon does not mean a weak spell for the year.

 In fact, the stock and the bond markets remained unruffled by the CMIE forecast. The BSE sensex recovered smartly by 50.69 points as fresh buying came in at lower levels. The index breached the 6800 levels to end at 6832.68. Though the government security prices also remained steady, the rupee faltered against the dollar due to the latters gains overseas.

 The BSE sensex had lost 77 points in the last two sessions on heavy selling pressure after a poor monsoon forecast. However, the mood was different today with investors turning buyers despite forecast of lower GDP growth by CMIE.

 The centres lower forecast comes against the optimism expressed by the Reserve Bank of India and Union finance minister P Chidambaram, who put Indias GDP growth for this year at 7 per cent.

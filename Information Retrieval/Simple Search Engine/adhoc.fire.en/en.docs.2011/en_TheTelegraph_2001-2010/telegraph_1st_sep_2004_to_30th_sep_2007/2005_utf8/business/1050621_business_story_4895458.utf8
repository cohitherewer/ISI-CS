 S amp;P flashes deal alert again

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 20: Two days after the Ambanis reached a settlement on the ownership tangle, Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P) today cautioned that the credit quality of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) could weaken if significant cash outflows were made as part of the deal.

 Pointing to the fact that the financial aspects of the settlement are still unclear, Anshukant Taneja, an analyst with the rating agency, said: Specifically, significant cash outflows, possibly resulting from share repurchases, division and distribution of liabilities and/or the contingent obligations of RIL, could affect the companys financial profile. This might weaken its credit quality.

 S amp;P said the full impact of the reorganisation of group businesses on the rating of RIL (BB+/Stable) will be known when the financial details are released by the company.

 Referring to the companys announcement, S amp;P said that the board of RIL is working on a reorganisation of businesses. As part of this, Mukesh Ambani will take unalloyed control of RIL and IPCL, the groups oil, gas and petrochemicals businesses. Anil will call the shots at Reliance Infocomm, Reliance Energy, and Reliance Capital. The three firms are the groups telecommunications, power and financial service ventures. 

 Standard amp; Poors noted that the de-merger and eventual exit of RIL from the groups capital-intensive telecommunications and power businesses should not have a negative impact on its business risk profile, the agency said. 

 Reiterating the position it took on June 10, the rating agency said the restructuring might even have a positive impact on RIL, whose current ratings and stable outlook are supported by a strong financial profile, a dominant presence in oil refining and petrochemicals and the current upswing in these businesses.

 For now, the outlook on RILs rating is stable. This signifies that the grading is unlikely to change, unless there are material adverse developments in the settlement between the companys chairman and vice-chairman.

 The agency said earlier this month that if the groups telecommunications wing is farmed out, along with the power and energy firms, to Anil ? who was also the RIL vice-chairman ? it would not rock the flagships finances. On the contrary, it might even have a positive bearing. 

 However, S amp;P cautioned that the profile of RIL could weaken if the cash payments involved in a settlement resulted in increased financial leverage, or a transfer of any of its oil refining and petrochemicals businesses.

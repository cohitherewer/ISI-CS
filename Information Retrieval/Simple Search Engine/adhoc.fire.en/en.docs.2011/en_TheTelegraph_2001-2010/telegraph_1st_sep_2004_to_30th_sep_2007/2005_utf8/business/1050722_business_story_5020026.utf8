 Anil takes VSNL row to Trai

 Anil: Voicing woes

 New Delhi, July 21: Reliance Infocomm chief Anil Ambani has requested Trai chairman Pradeep Baijal to intervene and give his company access to a VSNL landing station in Mumbai. 

 Anil met Baijal on Wednesday and pointed out that not allowing interconnection to landing stations amounted to monopolistic practice by VSNL.

 Ambani?s meeting with Baijal lasted for more than 90 minutes and was followed by discussions with other Trai members. He also talked about the latest technology that Reliance Infocomm plans to roll out as well as the issue of spectrum sharing.

 This was Anil?s first meeting with Baijal after taking over the reins of Reliance Infocomm following a settlement with elder brother Mukesh Ambani.

 The spat between Reliance Infocomm and VSNL broke out last week, when Anil?s firm alleged that the latter has denied it access to cable landing stations. 

 The company, in a written response to the Trai consultation paper, had said VSNL was adopting both price and non-price barriers and thus ?killing? competition in the bandwidth market. Bandwidth, the letter said, was crucial for its business plans.

 VSNL had strongly dismissed the allegation.

 Ranbaxy still under Lipitor shadow

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: Ranbaxy Laboratories today said it has won a key patents case on its atorvastatin patent in Norway against Pfizer. Atorvastatin is a cholesterol-lowering drug, which is marketed by Pfizer as Lipitor.

 The Norwegian court has ruled in favour of Ranbaxy and found that its product is not infringing on one of Pfizers product patents in the country.

 At the same time, the court has found that atorvastatin was infringing on another of Pfizers Norwegian patent involving a particular intermediate compound. Two other Lipitor patents were mentioned in the suit, but the court has not taken a stand on either of them. 

 Ranbaxy said it plans to appeal immediately to the Norwegian Court of Appeals against the second part of the judgment. 

 In addition, it plans to file an invalidity action in the Oslo City Court against the intermediate patents. A claim for invalidity against the intermediate patents had not been made previously by Ranbaxy.

 Pfizer said it was pleased with the courts decision, which is a victory not only for us, but for all innovators pursuing high-risk medical discoveries.

 We will continue to vigorously defend our intellectual property rights against infringements around the globe, the American drug giant said.

 Ranbaxy, which is challenging Pfizers patents on Lipitor in several countries, including the US, was recently allowed to appeal against a British court ruling that its atorvastatin drug infringed on Lipitor. The British court had ruled on October 12 that the Ranbaxy generic drug violated Pfizers basic patent on Lipitor.

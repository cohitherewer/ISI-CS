 New Delhi, Nov. 12: India and the US today signed an agreement to forge closer ties in agriculture and pledged to double two-way trade to $40 billion by 2008.

 The Indo-US agricultural co-operation agreement comes ahead of US President George Bushs visit to India in February. The agreement will aim at strengthening commercial linkages in agriculture. 

 The ministry of agriculture and the US department of agriculture (USDA) will form a knowledge initiative board for the purpose. 

 The first meeting of the board will be held in the US next month, US under secretary for farm and foreign agricultural services J. B. Penn said here today. 

 Mangala Rai, who is the secretary, department of agriculture education, and Penn signed the agreement in the presence of agriculture minister Sharad Pawar and US trade representative Robert Portman.

 Two-way trade

 Both commerce minister Kamal Nath and Portman have agreed that doubling of Indo-US trade in the next three years is a feasible target. 

 Our current level of trade at $21 billion is way below potential. We should aim at achieving a trade target of $40 billion in the next three years, commerce minister Kamal Nath said at a Ficci meeting, which he attended with Portman.

 Portman said doubling of trade in three years was an ambitious but achievable target and assured the support of the US administration in this regard.

 Indias total merchandise trade with the US stands at about $21 billion, of which Indian exports are $14 billion and imports around $7 billion.

 While large US corporate houses are already present in India, Nath said none of the American small and medium companies were looking at the country as a possible trade and investment destination.

 Portman, who is visiting India for the first time, is here to take part in the first meeting of the newly formed Indo-US trade policy forum. 

 Portman also held detailed discussion on investment and trade issues with finance minister P. Chidambaram. The meeting, which lasted for 30 minutes, was general in nature and WTO issues also figured in the discussions.

 Portman admitted at the Ficci meeting that the WTO talks were passing through tough times, but was non-committal on giving further concessions on agriculture, saying there was pressure from the domestic farm lobby.

 Unless we solve this problem of agriculture and non-agriculture market access it would not be possible to move this round , he said. 

 According to Portman, the EU will have to come out with a new proposal.

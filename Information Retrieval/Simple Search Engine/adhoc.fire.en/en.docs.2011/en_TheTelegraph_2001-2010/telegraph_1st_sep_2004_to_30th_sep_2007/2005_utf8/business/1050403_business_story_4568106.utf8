 LIC sees 20% growth in current fiscal

 Bhardwaj: Aiming high

 New Delhi, April 2: Life Insurance Corporation is expecting an over 20 per cent increase in business in the current financial year.

 The insurer is likely to close financial year 2004-05 with earnings worth Rs 15,800 crore, a growth of nearly 35 per cent over last year.

 ?The growth target for the current financial year has been set at a reasonably high rate, which is well over 20 per cent,? LIC chairman R. N. Bhardwaj said.

 The public sector insurer also plans to introduce a minimum of two to four unit- linked products in the current fiscal. At present, it has two Ulip plans ? Bima Plus and the recently launched Future Plus, a pension-linked plan.

 Ulip will contribute Rs 4,000 crore to the total premium, which LIC will garner in 2004-05. Bima Plus has clocked Rs 2,500 crore till the month of February (up from Rs 300 crore in 2003-04) and another Rs 1,500 crore is expected to be mopped up by Future Plus.

 LIC?s total exposure to the equity market stands at approximately Rs 32,000 crore. ?The market appreciation of our investments is 100 per cent. Exposure to equity is usually 8-9 per cent of the total assets. The figure will not fall lower than this even in future,? said Bhardwaj.

 At present, the corporation?s total asset is Rs 4 lakh crore.

 On the ongoing row between LIC and its nearly 80,000 junior employees over wage revision, he said, ?We will reach a settlement in a month or two.? 

 Sources said LIC will finally give a 13.36 per cent hike in wages to its clerical staff, a demand that has been pending since August 2002. 

 Bhardwaj said LIC has a 20-25 per cent share of total central government borrowings.

 Highlighting the importance of insurance and pension products, he said, ?They are essential for the economic development of the country.?

 Speaking on the occasion, T. K. Banerjee, member, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA), said it is unfortunate that private insurers are not adequately tapping the potential of the rural sector.

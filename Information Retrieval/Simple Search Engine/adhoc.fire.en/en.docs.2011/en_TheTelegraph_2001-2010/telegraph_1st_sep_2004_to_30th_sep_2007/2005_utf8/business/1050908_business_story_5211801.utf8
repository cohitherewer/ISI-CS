 Infotech firms see cash in new areas

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: Offshore infrastructure management is the next big business opportunity for Indian information technology (IT) companies with a business potential of more than $2 million a year from companies in the US and Europe. 

 Infrastructure management includes monitoring, managing and enhancing the performance of a clients IT infrastructure backbone. These include managing servers, data centres, networks and assets and providing desk-side support, IT security and maintenance services. 

 Forrester, the research firm that has produced more than 10 key reports on offshore infrastructure management, says Indian companies like HCL, Infosys, TCS and Wipro are leaders in the field but cannot afford to be complacent about their position.

 It has predicted that GTL, Microland, Patni, Satyam and Sify are emerging as the players that could pose a threat to the established firms. Forrester covered 20 vendors and spent more than a month in India researching this market. 

 Robert Macneill, senior analyst at Forrester Research, says, In India, we have ranked 13 vendors in depth capabilities. Indian export-oriented offshore infrastructure management is already $450 million and about 30-40 per cent of the work that is being conducted represents multi-year annuity services.

 The majority is out tasking, project and consulting work like XP deployment and infrastructure consolidation consulting. With the recent inclusion of the work from the US and European companies, the Indian offshore export market is already a $1-billion earner for India, quot; said Macneill. 

 According to Gartner, the collective contract value for the US and European annualised spending is more than $600 million. 

 Forrester has recommended that in order to further boost its potential in the offshore infrastructure management, Indian IT vendors should identify accounts up for re-compete and dissatisfied with current outsourcing relationships. Clients want to do infrastructure outsourcing, BPO, product development, and research and development offshore. 

 Sales personnel require focus and need to understand the implications of using reverse auctions. Baseline their costs, understand common service bundles in the local market and price benchmarks, said McNeill.

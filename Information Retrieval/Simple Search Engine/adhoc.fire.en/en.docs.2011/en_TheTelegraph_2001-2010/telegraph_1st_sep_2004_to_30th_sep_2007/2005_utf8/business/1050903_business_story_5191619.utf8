 Draft norms for pension funds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 2: The pension regulator today put out preliminary draft regulations for pension funds that will require them to give four investment options, including risk-free investment in government securities (or gilts).

 The draft regulations were issued at the behest of the parliamentary standing committee. The regulator is seeking suggestions from the public and interested parties on the draft provisions that include a set of tough eligibility criteria.

 The draft regulations, however, did not set the minimum capital requirement for pension funds. There was a move to peg it at Rs 100 crore as in the case of insurance firms but this prompted a volley of protest with a demand for a lower capital limit. This is one of the key issues on which suggestions have been sought.

 The draft norms will be also be taken up for discussion in Parliament when the bill is debated.

 The other three investment options would be a mix of gilt or government securities and equity-based index funds. The most adventurous pension fund subscriber will be allowed to take an equity exposure of a maximum of 50 per cent with the rest of the money mandatorily invested in risk-free securities. These could be gilts, corporate bonds that have an investment grade rating from at least two credit rating agencies and loans made by micro finance institutions that are guaranteed by the Reserve Bank of India.

 Investment in stocks will be limited to those that figure on approved indices like BSE 30 or Nifty 50.

 The PFRDA will give licences to pension funds after considering at least six criteria ? minimum capital requirement, past track record, including ability to provide guaranteed returns, costs and fee structure, IT capability and human resource.

 The draft norms also stipulates issue of permanent retirement account number to all subscribers, including a warranty that it cannot be used by any other party. Banks, insurers and other entities registered under the RBI, IRDA and Sebi would be eligible for acting as points of presence (POPs) to handle pension business. Cross-holding of ownership among entities that lead to conflict of interest would not be allowed. 

 The regulator would have powers to give licences, as well as suspend and cancel them. The norms also mandate publication of net asset values of schemes by pensions on a daily basis.

 A pension fund shall at all times ensure that the percentage exposures of the total fund to each asset class comply with the prescribed portfolio limits, the regulator said.

 White flag flutters, red carpet rolls

 New Delhi, Oct. 2: The peace dividend is paying off.

 A thaw in India-Pakistan relations has led to an over 400 per cent jump in Pakistani tourist arrivals into India in calendar year 2004.

 The total number of tourists visiting India from Pakistan rose to 52,388 from 10,364 in 2003.

 Balbir Singh Mayal, president, Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI), said, ?There has been a massive increase in business activities between the two neighbouring countries with a start in peace process. But travel for the purpose of tourism is yet to pick up. Much needs to be done in this area.?

 There?s been a change in the pecking order as well. The maximum number of tourists in India came from Bangladesh in 2003 at 4,54,611. But the eastern neighbour has been upstaged by both the US and the UK in 2004 (See table).

 The United States now tops the charts in terms of ?maximum foreign tourist arrival? category, according to the latest data released by the tourism ministry.

 Traditionally, India attracts maximum foreign tourists from the UK (if you leave Bangladesh out). But comparison between calendar year 2003 and 2004 shows that a total of 5,06,686 American tourists visited India between January and December 2004.

 This is against 4,96,805 tourists from the UK who visited India during the same period. While the difference may not be very large, sources said, ?This is just the beginning of a trend.?

 In 2003, a total of 4,30,917 tourists from the UK visited India, while tourist arrival from the US stood at 4,10,803.

 The surge in tourist arrivals from Pakistan comes at a time when the two neighbouring countries have been rebuilding bilateral relations.

 Track-II diplomacy, growing people-to-people interaction, has gained pace through the revival of civilian travel, cultural exchange, medical tourism and sports links.

 Simultaneously, the volume of formal trade has grown 74 per cent in 2004-05 to $600.77 million. 

 However, it is still less than a per cent of their combined total exports. The total size of illegal (through land borders) and circular trade (informal, through third countries) is much larger than the official trade between the two countries.

 According to a study conducted by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the annual free trade between India and Pakistan could reach $6 billion if trade barriers are removed.

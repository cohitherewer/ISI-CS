 Shakeup at Sony puts foreigner in lead role

 Tokyo, March 7 (Reuters): Sony Corp named the British-born head of its US operations, Howard Stringer, as its new chairman and chief executive on Monday, handing the reins of the struggling electronics maker to a foreigner for the first time. 

 Sony?s board agreed to appoint Stringer, 63, at an extraordinary meeting in Tokyo on Monday morning. Current CEO Nobuyuki Idei, 67, will step down to take responsibility for slumping earnings after five rocky years at the helm. 

 Stringer, a former TV journalist, will face the difficult task of boosting profitability at Sony, a sprawling conglomerate whose core electronics division is in danger of falling into the red for a second straight year in the business term ending on March 31 amid tough price competition and a lack of hit products. 

 ?We?ve led the consumer electronics world through the creation of great products ... As all the great institutions, Sony built a tremendous legacy,? Stringer told reporters. 

 ?But we cannot let that trap us, or inhibit us. We need to take that legacy and reinvent it.?

 A native of Wales who holds dual British and US citizenship, Stringer will become the first foreigner to run Sony, a company established by engineers in 1946 as a maker of telecoms and measuring equipment. 

 Under Idei?s watch, the inventor of the Walkman has been outmaneuvered by rivals Sharp Corp and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co in flat panel TVs and has lost its lead in the portable music industry to Apple Computer Inc and its popular iPod player. 

 President Kunitake Ando will also lose his job as part of the major management overhaul. He will be replaced by Ryoji Chubachi, an executive deputy president currently in charge of electronics parts and production operations. Chubachi will also serve as CEO of the electronics business worldwide. 

 Both Idei and Ando will be advisers to the new management team. 

 Shares of Sony ended 1.5 per cent higher at 4,070 yen, boosted by hopes for the new management. The benchmark Nikkei average rose 0.44 per cent. 

 ?It looks like the rainy, cloudy weather that?s been hanging over Sony could turn sunny,? said Kazunori Ohtomo, senior fund manager at STB Asset Management.

 ?Up until now I haven?t really been paying much attention to Sony?s stock but now I will be watching the issue closely,? he said. 

 Sony said the management transition would begin immediately but that the changes would become official on June 22, subject to approval at a general shareholders? meeting on the same day. 

 Ken Kutaragi, known as the father of the PlayStation game console and thought to have been a candidate for the top job at Sony, will resign his spot on the board and lose his position as executive in charge of semiconductors and home electronics. 

 Kutaragi will remain atop the game division and take on the new title of group executive officer on April 1, Sony said. 

 Stringer is likely to face comparison with Carlos Ghosn, the Brazilian-born head of Nissan Motor Co who raised the bar for foreign executives in Japan, being credited with saving the auto maker from near failure with aggressive job cuts and bold reforms.

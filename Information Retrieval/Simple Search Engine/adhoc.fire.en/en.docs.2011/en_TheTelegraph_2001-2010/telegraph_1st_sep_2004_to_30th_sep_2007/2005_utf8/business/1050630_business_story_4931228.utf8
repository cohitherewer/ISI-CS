 UPL, which is the amongst the worlds top five generic agrochemical companies, further said that the acquisition of SWAL will increase its access to markets in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. 

 SWAL is engaged in manufacturing and marketing of agrochemicals and fertiliser mixtures with its plant located at Haldia in Bengal. The Shaw Wallace group company has three major brands ?Starthene, MIT and Sterameal ? in its portfolio. Following the acquisition deal, its businesses will be immediately integrated with that of United. SWAL has posted a revenue of Rs 70 crore for the year ended March 31, after bouncing back into the black in 2003-04 with a net profit of Rs 1.61 crore. 

 The sale of SWAL is the third such deal being struck by the Jumbo group. It had earlier sold Shaw Wallace amp; Companys spirits business to the UB Group and divested 70 per cent of Hindustan Dorr Oliver to IVRCL Infrastructures amp; Projects Ltd.

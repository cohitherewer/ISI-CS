 Calcutta, Sept. 20: The ministry of commerce and industry has cleared the proposal of setting up a free trade and warehousing zone at Haldia.

 This will be the first such zone in the country and will be developed as a 51:49 joint venture between IL amp;FS and MMTC, said G.K. Pillai, additional secretary, ministry of commerce and industry.

 Around Rs 200 crore will be invested in the project and it will be ready by the middle of 2006, Pillai said on the sidelines of a session organised by the Export Promotion Council for EOUs and SEZs.

 The objective of a free trade and warehousing zone is to create trade-related infrastructure to facilitate the import and export of goods and services with freedom to carry out trade transactions in free currency. Currently, such zones are present in Singapore and Dubai in Asia.

 Pillai said such a zone will help importers reduce their cost of warehousing customs bonded goods. Now, such goods have to be kept in free trade and warehousing zones in Singapore and Dubai. After that, they are brought to the country, which substantially increases the cost, he said.

 Exports from export-oriented units (EOUs) and special economic zones (SEZs) will touch $20 billion by 2010, said S. Jaipuria, chairman of Export Promotion Council of EOUs and SEZs.

 Exports from EOUs and SEZs is growing at 30 per cent per annum. During 2004-05, total exports from these regions stood at $1.16 billion. By 2020, the exports volumes will touch $80 billion, he said.

 The government will also pay special attention to develop EOUs and SEZs, said Pillai. We have also cleared the proposal of setting up 64 SEZs at an investment of Rs 60,000 crore, including 14 big ones, which will generate employment of over 1 lakh, he said.

 One such SEZ is being set up by Mukesh Ambani at Jamnagar at an investment of Rs 10,000 crore, while another is being set up at Noida by Anil Ambani at a cost of Rs 6,000 crore, he added.

 Oil diplomacy harps on history

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Singh: Renewing old ties

 New Delhi, Jan. 19: India?s ?oil diplomacy? will focus on Russia and Africa as thrust areas for acquiring oil equity abroad, external affairs minister Natwar Singh said at the Petrotech 2005 conference here today.

 The minister said: ?We have very special historic relations with Moscow and negotiations are on to significantly expand India?s investment in the Russian energy sector.?

 The comment assumes significance in the light of the Russian invitation to invest in the Sakhalin III exploration block and the ongoing efforts on the part of the government to enable OVL to pick up a stake in the assets of Yukos.

 Interestingly, a Russian newspaper reported today that China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and ONGC were ready to provide funds to state-owned oil major Rosneft, which had acquired the biggest oilfield for Yukos in an auction recently. 

 CNPC is reported to have agreed to provide a medium- term loan of $6 billion to Rosneft in return for crude oil supplies, while ONGC is keen to invest around $2 billion for buying a share in the asset.

 The minister said that Russia is a principal source of global energy and has played a pioneering role in setting up Indias oil and gas infrastructure over the last 50 years. 

 ?It is a matter of considerable satisfaction that India has attempted to repay this debt by investing in the development of Russias oil and gas sector in Siberia by acquiring a 20 per cent stake in Sakhalin 1. 

 He said that Africa also provides a special opportunity with the emergence of major oil producing countries in the continent. Of the eight billion barrels of crude oil reserves discovered worldwide in 2001, seven billion barrels were in west and central Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa holds 7 per cent of the worlds oil reserves and contributes 11 per cent of the world?s oil production.

 ?The challenge before both the ministries of external affairs and petroleum is to engage in a deeper diplomatic dialogue with the principal African countries so that the traditional goodwill is leveraged into long-term energy-based engagement,? he said, adding that India would build upon its historic ties with Africa that date back to the participation in its anti-colonial struggle. 

 Singh said the other area where India?s energy related diplomacy has recently penetrated is Latin America. The mechanisms of the oil market are such that oil assets do not necessarily have to be brought back to India and consumed here; they can be sold in other markets which require them, he added.

 The external affair minister said that India has established significant energy-related stakes in Venezuela and was pursuing new opportunities vigorously in Columbia, Cuba, Ecuador, Trinidad-Tobago as well as Brazil and Argentina.

 He added that Indias oil diplomacy had to address the challenges related to the issue of oil prices and the need for an Asian marker so that a stable market emerges. He hailed the petroleum ministers initiative on organising the round table conference of Asian ministers as a step towards this direction.

 The minister further stated that transnational pipelines such as the proposed Myanmar-Bangladesh-India pipeline were attractive techno-economic proposals that ?have within them the ability to qualitatively transform the relationships of the countries of the region.?

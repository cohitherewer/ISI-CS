 Spanish firms locked in power duel

 Madrid/London, Sept. 6 (Reuters): Spains largest power utility Endesa is likely to reject an unsolicited 22.55 billion euro ($28.31 billion) bid from rival Gas Natural, a source familiar with the situation said.

 Endesas board was to meet late on Tuesday to consider the offer from the Barcelona-based gas distributor and wholesaler to reshape the Spanish energy sector and create one of the worlds largest utilities.

 But the source, who is familiar with Endesas thinking, said the company could be swayed if enough political pressure was applied, ushering in the countrys largest-ever takeover.

 Spains Socialist government is believed to look more favourably on the idea of a national champion than did the previous conservative government, which killed off several proposed mergers in Spains energy sector.

 The shares were up 8.2 per cent at 20.64 euros after resuming trade following a suspension.

 Gas Natural stock was down 3.7 per cent at 23.88 euros, valuing its offer at 20.93 euros per share.

 Gas Natural chief executive Rafael Villaseca told a conference call the company would not increase its bid, nor change the proposed proportion of cash and shares. We will not change our offer. This is our only offer and thats it, Villaseca said.

 The offer is fixed. There is no flexibility there, he said when asked about increasing the cash component.

 Villaseca also downplayed concerns that there was no attempt to negotiate with Endesa ahead of time, saying,We thought the initiative was ours. ... The issues will be ironed out as we go along.

 Nor was Villaseca concerned about possible regulatory or antitrust opposition, saying the side agreement to sell 7 to 9 billion euros worth of assets to rival power utility Iberdrola would assuage officials on both scores.

 Plan to widen power pool

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, June 26: The Planning Commission has suggested that National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) make new investments with state utilities or private sector companies. This is expected to reduce the control of central public sector utilities on the power sector.

 The central power utilities, which include NTPC, NHPC and Neepco, have surplus funds because of the preferential payment arrangements they enjoy and the post-tax returns of 14 per cent allowed to them.

 A section of the power industry officials said regulators do not provide adequate returns to state power sector units. Hence, they are not left with adequate investible resources to meet demands of distribution.

 The tariff structure of most SEBs do not generate enough returns for them. Moreover, they have to meet payment obligations to central utilities under the tripartite agreement.

 This means that in order to invest in distribution, they have to borrow funds, which further worsens their financial condition. 

 Most of the times, financial institutions and banks are not eager to fund our projects because our returns are low and our financial health weak, said a senior official of the West Bengal State Electricity Board.

 Unless technical and commercial losses come down to around 15-20 per cent from the current level of 40 per cent, state utilities cannot be expected to pay central units even for current purchases.

 The central public sector units are expected to account for about 53 per cent of the energy generated in the country by 2012.

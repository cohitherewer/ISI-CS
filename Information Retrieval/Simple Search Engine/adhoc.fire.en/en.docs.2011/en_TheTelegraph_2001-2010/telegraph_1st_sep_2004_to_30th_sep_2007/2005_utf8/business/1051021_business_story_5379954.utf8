 New Delhi, Oct. 20: Canon India plans to tie up with big retail and consumer electronic chains next year to boost sales.

 ?We are in talks with four to five retail chains like Shoppers? Stop for tie-ups. It will happen sometime next year,? president and CEO Alan Grant said.

 Eyeing a Rs 400-crore turnover in 2006, the company today rolled out 43 new products and announced a shift in its marketing strategy to achieve a 30 per cent growth during the year.

 Canon India is likely to record a Rs 310-crore annual sales this year against Rs 264 crore clocked last year.

 ?Our new go-to-market strategy comprises de-layering the distribution channel, expanding retail and creating a value shift as we plan to garner revenues worth Rs 400 crore in 2006,? said Grant. Of this, Rs 100 crore will come from the company?s camera business, he added.

 The products unveiled by Canon today include seven digital cameras, seven printers, two digital SLRs and photo printers, four DC camcorders, a scanner, four AIOs, five projectors, a fax machine, a laser MFD, two DRs, four image runners and two LFPs.

 ?The company expects the new products to contribute 30 per cent of the total revenues of Canon India by 2006,? vice-president Alok Bharadwaj said.

 The company will undertake ?value shift? to achieve a 30 per cent growth, said Grant, adding that the focus was on units and entry-level products.

 ?Instead of low-end products, we will now focus on technology and value for money, besides capturing new trends in digital photography, printing, home video and multi-functional devices,? he said.

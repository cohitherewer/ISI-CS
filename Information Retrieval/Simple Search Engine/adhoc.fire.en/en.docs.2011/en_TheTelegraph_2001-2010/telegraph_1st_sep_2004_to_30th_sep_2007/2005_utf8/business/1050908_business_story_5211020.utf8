 New Delhi, Sept. 7: General Motors India today launched the Chevrolet Optra Royale ? a new variant of the luxury sedan ? with a price tag of Rs 8.99 lakh.

 Powered by a 1.6-litre VGIS engine, the model has a sunroof and leather upholstery.

 With this new offering, GM India plans to re-launch the Optra and regain its leadership position, said Amit Dutta, vice-president (marketing), General Motors India.

 This car belongs to the D segment, which has seen a drop of 30 per cent in sales last month.

 The company aims to sell about 38,000 cars during 2005 compared with about 25,000 units sold last year. The sales target for Optra at 9,000 units has factored in the growth that the company is expecting from the new variant, Dutta said.

 General Motors India, the wholly-owned arm of the US-based General Motors Corp, has registered a 33 per cent growth in sales at 20,322 units during January-August 2005. The sales in August jumped by 40 per cent.

 We are looking at a sales growth of 10-20 per cent this year, said Dutta.

 Sales have been primarily driven by the growing demand of its utility vehicle Chevrolet Tavera. Optra sales have remained more or less stagnant.

 The Optra Chevrolet Royale will compete with Toyotas Corolla, Hyundais Elantra and the top-end variant of Hondas City in the domestic automobile market.

 General Motors has sold over 18,000 units of the Optra since its launch in July-August 2003. Last year, the Optra sales stood at around 9,000 units but have been flat so far this year at about 4,800 units.

 However, Dutta expects the sales to rise in the festive season. 

 General Motors India is also set to expand its plant capacity in Halol to 60,000 units from the current 40,000.

 CPM smells scam in airport update plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ground reality?

 New Delhi, Dec. 19: The CPM today alleged that the civil aviation ministry has decided to give away Nagpur airport to Maharashtra for a token Re 1 so that the state in return waives the Rs 250-crore stamp duty on Mumbai airport to help private bidders.

 ?This is a major scam in the offing. A private sector bidder will be helped out of paying this huge sum by the central government which will, in turn, be giving away a whole airport to the Maharashtra government for virtually no gain,? party MP Nilotpal Basu said.

 The CPM said the bidding process for both Mumbai and Delhi airports should be cancelled and the work of upgrading the two airports given to the Airports Authority of India. The demand came even as the inter-ministerial group on the bidding recommended Reliance-ASA Mexico and GMR-Fraport as the two short-listed bidders.

 Civil aviation ministry officials, however, claimed that ?waiver has been sought for both Mumbai and Delhi airports? and said there was nothing unusual about it. Nor do they feel the transfer of Nagpur airport is very unusual as ?the Maharashtra government has, for the last five years, been proposing the development of an international multi-modal passenger and cargo hub at Nagpur?.

 The CPM also alleged that the merchant bankers to the airport privatisation bid, ABN Amro, and law firm Amarchand Mangaldas, the legal adviser to the bidding process, were both linked to Reliance group?s Anil Ambani, a key bidder for the two airports who had emerged successful in the short-listing process.

 But officials from that group pointed out that ABN Amro had acted as merchant bankers to Reliance Industries Ltd, which was run by elder brother Mukesh Ambani. They also said Cyril Shroff, managing partner of Amarchand Mangaldas, had resigned in May last year from the board of the Anil Ambani-run Reliance Energy.

 Basu, however, said this was when the appointment of consultants was taking place. ?The entire deal is a scam and the Nagpur airport handing over in return for duty waiver a sweetener,? he alleged.

 Some six consortiums, including Reliance Energy, Subhash Chandra?s Essel Group, Sterlite and London-based DS Constructions, had filed bids for Delhi and Mumbai airports.

 New Delhi, Nov. 27: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today looked at a timeframe of two to four months to resolve the debate in the ruling United Progressive Alliance over relaxing norms for foreign direct investment (FDI). 

 Speaking to reporters after addressing the India Economic Summit, Chidambaram said the government was involved in a debate on the issue and the matter would be resolved in 2-4 months.

 Manmohan Singhs government and its ally, the Left, do not agree on allowing FDI in retail trade, to cite one example. There are also differences over opening up banking further.

 At the conference, organised by the World Economic Forum and the Confederation of Indian Industry, the minister said: We must open the doors to foreign direct investment? Opening up of certain sectors for FDI is important to achieve a higher growth.

 Business leaders saw the statement as indicative of the governments commitment to inviting larger FDI flows.

 The Left, which has been opposing opening up of retail, has argued that supermarket chains like Wal-Mart would lead to millions of jobs being lost. But in recent weeks, its leaders, including Bengal chief minister Budhdhadeb Bhattacharjee, have spoken of allowing FDI in operations like cold chains where both funds and technology were needed. It is not opposed to FDI in wholesale trade either.

 Chidambaram also argued for further opening up banking. Indian banks require about $11-12 billion of Tier I capital. Unless banks are able to raise the amount, they would not be able to finance large infrastructure projects. 

 We are addressing the issue. Banks must grow in size and must acquire more financial muscle.

 The government has moved to liberalise banking laws, but has to get parliamentary approval.

 Foreign investment, he said, can work wonders in India and the fact that the country attracts only a fraction of Chinas FDI needs to be given a serious consideration.

 Hinting at fresh moves to cut red tape, the minister said: Despite liberal industrial and economic policies, India remains a difficult place to attract large amounts of FDI. 

 This has also disabled Indias comparative advantage of a large pool of its young workforce, which will continue to grow over the next 20 years. Although India is counted among the most efficient industrialised nations in steel-making, crude oil mining and garment manufacture, it is not enough as we have to move into becoming a more innovative society. 

 He spoke of the need to push funding into research and development to spur innovation and grab product leadership just as Japan and Korea have taken in the field of automobile design.

 Sustained high growth in agriculture is the primary determinant for clocking steady economic growth of over 8 per cent. 

 We must allow the corporate sector to enter agriculture without disturbing the sacred relationship between the tiller and his plot of land. There is a great opportunity for the corporate sector in the areas of production, post-harvest and supply chain management and ensure a growth rate of more than 4 per cent for agriculture, he said.

 He acknowledged that there was a huge infrastructure deficiency, though the public-private partnership model had started showing results in seaports and airports. 

 What we lack is the killer instinct. We are efficient, while China is ruthlessly efficient, Chidambaram said.

 Bank recast for 8% growth 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 6: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said financial sector reforms, including a roadmap to improve the banking industry, could help speed up GDP growth to 8 per cent.

 ?We can have an 8 per cent growth. The question is how to create a financial sector that can foster this growth,? he said at a conference jointly organised by IRADe and India Invest Economic Foundation.

 The finance minister is expected to come out with a plan for banking reforms, which will include allowing foreign banks to take up to 74 per cent stake in private Indian banks. Chidambaram said the roadmap for banking sector reforms would be unveiled in a few days. ?We lost 7-10 days because of the tsunami,? he added.

 He had earlier said the roadmap, including the hike in FDI in private banks from 49 to 74 per cent, would be announced by December 2004.

 On better risk management, the minister said, ?With insurance and derivatives, risks are controlled, which increases the viability of projects and foster higher investment rates. This, in turn, leads to higher GDP growth.? When risk is controlled, cost of capital comes down, he said.

 Regarding the common minimum programme, he said there was a need to strengthen financial sector regulators and run them more professionally.

 Chidambaram said the creation of the Securities and Exchange Board of India and Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority infused more energy in the financial system. 

 ?After Sebi and IRDA, the Pension Funds Regulatory Authority (PFRDA) will more or less complete the financial architecture,? he added.

 Stating that most of the earlier measures were adopted on a ?trial and error? basis, he added, ?We should not adopt that route now, but follow the best practices available in the world.? 

 A number of scams had exposed weaknesses in the functioning of the securities watchdog and the government is anxious that this is not repeated in the pension sector where besides financial architecture, social security is at stake. 

 Chidambaram asked financial sector intermediaries to come up with suggestions on how to improve the financial sector architecture, strengthen regulations and foster competition to emerge as global players.

 The finance minister also allayed fears on service tax expressed by the trader community, who have threatened to go on a nationwide strike.

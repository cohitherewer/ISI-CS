 Merger of PSU banks on track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chidambaram: Firm

 New Delhi, March 24: The Congress-led government seems to have made up its mind about going ahead with mergers of state-run banks, ignoring the protests from the Left parties.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram said he had discussed the issue with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and both have agreed that the only way to strengthen the banking sector was through mergers of state-run banks. 

 Brushing aside the Left objections and bankers? stir against mergers, Chidambaram today asked banks to educate workers on the need for mergers and acquisitions to become globally competitive.

 ?Competition, convergence and consolidation will be the key drivers of the banking industry in the future. The fear of job loss with consolidation was not justifiable,? Chidambaram said while inaugurating a Punjab National Bank branch here today.

 ?Each one has a responsibility to communicate about the new drivers ? competition, convergence and consolidation ? among the employers and staff,? he said.

 ?I will urge employees and staff to reflect on consolidation. It adds size, scale, muscle, technology and reduces cost of operations,? the minister said.

 ?We need strong banks and I am confident that we are on the right path. I spoke to the Prime Minister and we reflected on the issue...This is the path we must take,? he said.

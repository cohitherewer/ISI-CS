 Honda labour woes deepen 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 6: Honda Motorcycles and Scooters India (HMSI) has declared an unofficial lockout at its Manesar (Haryana) production facility.

 The managements decision seems to have been sparked by a month-long strike by workers of the factory. Honda employees have dubbed the decision as illegal.

 The HMSI union claims that the management is not allowing workers to go back to work, although it has not officially declared a lockout. It is willing to allow the workers in only if they sign an undertaking.

 The workers are demanding that the union leaders who were terminated and the employees who were suspended be taken back.

 The management, however, says they should first be cleared in an inquiry.

 The Japanese two-wheeler giant had entered the Indian automobile market nearly four years back.

 Speaking to The Telegraph earlier this week, company sources had said, The management will now take the workers, who intend to cause any damage to the company, to task. The factory has 2,500 employees. 

 In protest, CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta will stage a dharna on the factory premises next Monday. 

 According to company officials, the workers were up in arms demanding higher wages. 

 There are some local miscreants who have joined hands with the trade union for their vested interests. Besides causing great damage to machinery, they are threatening workers who are willing to work, a senior official said. 

 These local people are luring them with promises of higher wages. But we hope to sort out the matter before the month-end, he added. 

 Officials said earlier this year, the company had given a 30 per cent raise to the employees across the board. 

 Sources say the company has suffered a loss of Rs 100 crore due to the labour unrest at the facility. Since the problem started, the company has suspended 25 line associates and dismissed five others.

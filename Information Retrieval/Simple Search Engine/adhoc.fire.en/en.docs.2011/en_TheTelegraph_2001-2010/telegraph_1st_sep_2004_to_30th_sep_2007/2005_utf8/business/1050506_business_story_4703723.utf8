 Posco deal still on track

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, May 5: The Posco deal may be on, after all. The Orissa government is preparing a fresh blueprint for the proposed steel plant at Paradip port.

 Top Orissa government officials, including chief secretary Subas Pani and steel secretary Bhaskar Chatterjee, are giving the final touches to the draft MoU which would be sent to Posco officials in three days. 

 Orissa steel and mines minister Padmanabha Behera today said the MoU is likely to be signed next week once it is cleared by Posco. 

 ?Our team of bureaucrats is negotiating with Posco officials. The draft MoU will be sent to them within this weekend. The ball is now in their court. They can take it or leave it,? Behera told The Telegraph. 

 Posco India representative Ryu Ho Chang is in Bhubaneswar to negotiate with the state government officials. Chang confirmed that he was in touch with the officials and is discussing the MoU, which could be signed next week.

 ?There are some issues to be resolved. I hope it will be sorted out soon,? Chang said. ?I am very optimistic about the deal,? he added, refusing to reveal anything about the conditions in the new MoU. 

 The deal has been postponed twice so far ? first in February and then on April 14, when Posco asked Orissa to allow it to export whatever was left over from the 600 MTPA of iron ore supplied to it. 

 Although Orissa has rejected Poscos demand of a billion tonnes of ore, the MoU assures a supply of 600 million tonnes for the next 30 years. Although the state has rejected Poscos demand for 400 million tonnes of ore for export to Korea, it has offered to export the same through MMTC.

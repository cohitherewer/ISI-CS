 NTPC squares off for Reliance court clash

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Ground reality

 New Delhi, Dec. 7: The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) is taking legal and administrative steps to enforce its gas-supply contract with Reliance Industries. 

 NTPC is taking legal steps to enforce the contract. The power ministry has written to the petroleum and natural gas ministry for initiating administrative measures, power minister P.M. Sayeed told the Rajya Sabha. He was replying to a query on some changes sought by Reliance in its contract with NTPC. Sayeed said these would have adverse commercial impact on NTPC. 

 The power ministry wants appropriate steps for revising Reliances production sharing contract, he said. 

 Sayeed said Reliances request would affect limitation of liability, gas-supply obligation and development and production plans.

 Reliance had entered into an agreement to supply natural gas from its giant field in the eastern offshore Krishna-Godavri basin to NTPCs proposed power plants at Kawas and Gandhar in Gujarat. A 1400-km pipeline to carry the gas from the eastern coast to Gujarat was also planned. 

 However, with international prices of oil and gas shooting up, Reliance appears to have gone slow on its plans for laying the pipeline. 

 The gas exploration block, which ONGC had identified and wanted to retain, was given to Reliance for further exploration. 

 According to the production sharing contract signed with the petroleum ministry, clear milestones have been laid for developing the field and starting commercial production of gas. 

 NTPC requires 13 million standard cubic metres of gas per day for the two plants. Reliance had quoted a price of $2.97 per million British thermal units. 

 As NTPC has to supply power at a fixed rate, it cannot afford to pay a higher price. If it does, the project would become unviable. Each project is expected to generate 1,300 mw. The plants should go on stream by 2007. 

 Reliance claims work for developing the gas field has slowed down as drilling rigs are not easily available in the international market. 

 The directorate-general of hydrocarbons will look into the matter and decide if the delay has been deliberate. 

 The government is also entitled to a share of the gas as Reliance was awarded the block as part of a production sharing contract. GAIL will look after the governments share of the gas. 

 GAIL is also keen to lay the pipeline to carry the gas through its national grid. The gas major has complained to the petroleum ministry about Reliances delay and has sought permission to take up the project. GAIl claims it would be able to reduce transport costs if it was allowed to carry the gas through its national grid.

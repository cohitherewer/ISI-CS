 Inflation rate rises to 4.62%

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Dec. 30: The rate of inflation rose to 4.62 per cent for the week ended December 17, from 4.5 per cent in the previous week mainly due to costlier fuel and non-food items.

 Increase in prices of naphtha, furnace oil, bitumen, cottonseed, fodder, soyabean, coconut oil, gur and pork pushed up the inflation rate marginally, but it was much lower than 6.44 per cent a year ago.

 The wholesale price index declined by 0.2 per cent to 197.1 points due to fall in prices of fruits and vegetables, condiments and spices, urad, tobacco groundnut seed, mustard seed and some edible oils. It was 188.4 points a year ago.

 During the week under review, global oil prices tumbled to $58.06 a barrel on forecasts of warmer weather in the United States.

 But domestic petrol and diesel prices were stable as the government preferred a wait-and-watch policy due to the volatility in international crude oil prices that has contributed most to the inflation in India in 2005.

 The government and the Reserve Bank are watching the price situation as they intend to keep the inflation rate within the range of 5-5.5 per cent till March 2006. 

 The index for primary articles group fell by 0.4 per cent to 195.1 points due to cheaper food items, while non-food articles became costlier. The index was 185.5 points a year ago.

 The food articles group index declined by 0.7 per cent to 197.7 points.

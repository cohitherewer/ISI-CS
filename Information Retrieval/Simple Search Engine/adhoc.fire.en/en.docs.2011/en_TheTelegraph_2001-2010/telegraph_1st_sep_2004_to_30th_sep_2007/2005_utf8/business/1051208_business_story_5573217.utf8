 Calcutta, Dec. 7: Intel will launch its low-energy and rugged Community PC in India soon.

 ?We plan to bring the Community PC to the market in the first quarter of next year,? Intel South Asia director R.K. Amar Babu said at Infocom 2005 organised by Nasscom and Businessworld, an ABP group publication.

 The Community PC has been developed by Intel and is targeted at rural markets in emerging economies like India. The product is being tested at 20 village centres across the country and will help rural people access information through the Internet. It is also expected to provide user-friendly applications under e-governance.

 ?Besides the regular features, the computer will also have wireless Internet access,? said Babu. ?We have enhanced the performance of some chips to enable the PC to run on low power sources like car batteries and yet access the Internet through wireless.?

 The Community PC can use a car battery as its back-up energy supply, as electricity is rare in many parts of rural India. 

 Unlike the standard computer that operates on 240 volts, the Community PC has been designed to run on an 80-volt power source. It also works on both AC and DC connections.

 Moreover, to meet the rugged conditions of the rural environment, the computer has been equipped with special screens and filters to reduce the amount of dust and insects that can enter the box and impact reliability. The computer has also been designed to handle extreme heat conditions ? more than 38 degree Celsius.

 The PC has a recovery software to help rebuild the software structure in case of failure due to mishandling. This is also important since a single unit will be accessed by a number of users with varying degrees of literacy.

 Intel is yet to decide on the pricing of the product though it is expected to be around Rs 10,000.

 The industry, however, feels that the key issue is not the absolute cost. Issues like finance schemes, connectivity ? wireless or wired ? and content development in local languages have to be addressed to increase PC and Internet penetration in rural areas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Stocks in Europe bleed

 July 7 (Reuters): Deadly attacks on Londons transport system rocked European financial markets on Thursday, wiping tens of billions of euros in value from equity markets and knocking British shares to their biggest one-day loss in a year. 

 Transport and luxury goods stocks were among the worst hit, as investors feared the explosions would discourage global travel, as happened after the September 11, 2001 attacks.

 The explosions also hurt US equity markets.

 The dollar slid against the Swiss franc, seen as a major safe-haven currency. Sterling was down 0.5 per cent against the dollar at $1.7452, trimming losses after hitting an earlier 19-month low against the greenback of around $1.7403.

 Gold for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchanges COMEX division jumped 0.4 per cent at the open in New York.

 In Omaha, Nebraska, US treasury secretary John Snow said financial markets were down but were working effectively without disruption.

 News of the explosions sent US crude oil prices as low as $57.20 a barrel, off a record high of $62.10 in earlier trade.

 But oil bounced back to around $60.61 as traders balanced near-term concerns of storms in the Gulf of Mexico shutting crude production against worries of a US and global economic slowdown linked to fears of further attacks.

 The FTSEurofirst 300 index ended 1.8 per cent down at 1,136.1, while Londons FTSE 100 halved its losses to end 1.4 per cent weaker at 5,158.3? with all but two of the benchmarks components in the red.

 Its obviously tragic for individuals directly involved, but from a market perspective itll be a one or two day effect, Robin Woodall, a fund manager at F amp;C Asset Management, said.

 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 19.86 points at 10,250.82. The Standard amp; Poors 500 Index was down 3.19 points at 1,191.75. The technology-laced Nasdaq Composite Index was down 2.02 points at 2,066.63.

 Leading Asian markets, like Hong Kongs Hang Seng and Japans Nikkei also fell. However, the bearish mood was due to a correction in these markets and not the blasts, as their trading had closed before the attack.

 Hong Kongs benchmark Hang Seng index lost 0.84 per cent, or 19.12 points, at 14,030.81. 

 Japans Nikkei share average edged down 0.12 per cent. It closed 13.39 points lower at 11,590.14.

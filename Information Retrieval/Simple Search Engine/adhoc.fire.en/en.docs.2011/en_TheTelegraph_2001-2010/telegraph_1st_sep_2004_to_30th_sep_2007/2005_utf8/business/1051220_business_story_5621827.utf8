 New Delhi, Dec. 19: The ministry of tourism has requested the Planning Commission to ask all ministries to set aside a portion of their planned expenditure for upgrading tourism-related infrastructure in the country.

 We have made an appeal to the Planning Commission for requesting all ministries to make tourism a sub-plan. This will help build infrastructure, which is most important for boosting tourism activities, said Renuka Chaudhury, Union minister of tourism.

 In the last budget, Rs 415.75 crore was allocated for building tourism infrastructure in the country.

 The minister said India has become the fifth most-preferred tourist destination in the world and if there is proper integration between various ministries, the tourism sector would benefit from it.

 She was addressing the two-day Tourism and Heritage Summit organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.

 Talking about fund allocation that the ministry will demand for 2006-07, she said, We hope to receive a considerable amount, which is higher than last year. We have laid out our plan and will soon submit the papers to the ministry.

 In the last budget, the finance ministry allocated Rs 786 crore for tourism from Rs 500 crore in 2004-05. 

 Speaking about adventure tourism, Chaudhury said the ministry has called for wavering of import duty on equipment used for promoting adventure tourism. The minister also spoke about a vision statement for the sector for the next 5-10 years.

 Nilotpal Basu, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on transport, tourism and culture, advocated the need for creating a national tourism promotion policy.

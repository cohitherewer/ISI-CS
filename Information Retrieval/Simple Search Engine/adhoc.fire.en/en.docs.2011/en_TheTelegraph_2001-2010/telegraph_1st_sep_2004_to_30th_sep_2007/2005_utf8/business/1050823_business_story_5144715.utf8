 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 WAIT and Watch

 Calcutta, Aug. 22: RPG Retail has shelved its plan for an initial public offering (IPO) to finance its expansion plans. Instead the company has decided to go on its own and invest Rs 100 crore from its internal accruals.

 Talking to The Telegraph, Sumantra Banerjee, president and CEO of RPG Retail, said, There is no immediate plans to float an IPO. The funds required for expanding our retail business will be met through our internal accruals.

 The company has chalked out an aggressive expansion plan to double its retail footage by April next. The idea is to double the present area of 350,000 square feet under retail to 700,000 square feet by April 2006, said Banerjee. According to him, the RPG group expects the retail business to contribute at least 25 per cent of its estimated turnover of Rs 10,000 crore in the next two years. Alongside its stronghold in power, tyres and tyre raw materials and music, the RPG group has a good presence in the retail sector as well, with a chain of stores under the brand names Musicworld, Foodworld and Spencers hypermarkets.

 Initially, RPG Retail concentrated in the southern and the western region of the country. Were now looking to expand in the northern, western and the eastern regions. We will open two Spencers hypermarkets in Calcutta along with a chain of food stores, Banerjee said. 

 The company has already taken the decision to open retail stores at Vishakhapatnam, Chennai, Hyderabad (second), Bangalore (two stores), Mumbai (two more), Delhi (three stores) and Vijayawada.

 Banerjee said the addition of Spencers hypermarkets would add to the strength of the companys existing strength in the retail sector. The retail business is already yielding a turnover of nearly Rs 1,000 crore for the company. We expect that our turnover from the retail sector will touch Rs 2,500 crore in the next two years by when the group turnover will be around Rs 10,000 crore, he added. 

 The group will have 35 per cent of its total turnover from tyres and tyre raw material, 30 per cent from power and remaining 10 per cent from other businesses. 

 Currently RPG Retail has a total of 133 stores under various brand names across the country.

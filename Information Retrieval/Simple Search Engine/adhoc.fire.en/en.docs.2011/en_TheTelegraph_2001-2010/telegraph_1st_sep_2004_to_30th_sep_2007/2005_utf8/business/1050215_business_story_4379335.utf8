 Calcutta, Feb. 14: Private business partners in India and Russia should interact among themselves rather than the governments to facilitate bilateral trade, said Vyachestav Ivanovich Trubnikov, ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary of the Russian Federation in India, at a seminar organised by the Federation of Indian Export Organisations (Fieo).

 Trade between the two countries is being affected due to macro-economic instability, inadequate banking facilities and poor transit facilities.

 India?s exports to Russia, which stood at $800 million in 1998, have dwindled to $583 million in 2003. Russian companies are keen to invest in India. The Russian government also wants Indian companies to participate in the privatisation process unleashed in that country.

 Russia is now implementing large-scale projects like construction of Kudankulam nuclear power plant in India, offshore exploration and extraction of natural gas in the Bay of Bengal and development of offshore oil wells within the framework of the ?Sakhalin 1? project with ONGC participation. 

 Russian companies are exploring the possibilities of investing in the aluminium industry and participating in the modernisation of Indian Railways.

 Union commerce ministry under secretary Rajeev Kumar, who was present at the meeting, said the rupee-rouble trade between the two countries is gradually decreasing. ?The hard currency trade is gradually showing signs of recovery,? Kumar added.

 India has identified certain ?focus? products to facilitate exports to Russia. These are plantation crops, drugs and pharma, machinery and instruments and leather.

 ?This focus product programme has helped increase exports to Russia and CIS countries,? Kumar added.

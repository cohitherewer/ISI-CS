 EMI earnings dip 13%

 London May 24 (Reuters): EMI Group, a leading music company, today said its full-year adjusted pretax profit fell more than 13 per cent, following delays in two key albums from Coldplay and Gorillaz.

 The company, whose artists include Radiohead and Norah Jones, said pretax profit before goodwill and exceptional items was ?141.9 million ($259.5 million) in the year to March 31, against ?163.3 million a year earlier. Analysts on average expected the company to post an adjusted pretax profit of ?139.2 million, according to a poll of 13 brokerages.

 Turnover declined 8.4 per cent to ?1.94 billion. At constant currencies, turnover fell 5.1 per cent, with EMI Music Publishing turnover up 4.9 per cent and EMI Music turnover down 7.4 per cent.

 Digital sales, which the industry is counting on to drive growth after years of online piracy, surged to ?49.7 million from ?15.1 million a year earlier. 

 We remain confident that digital music will drive the industry forward at attractive growth rates and that it will become a significantly larger proportion of our business, the company said.

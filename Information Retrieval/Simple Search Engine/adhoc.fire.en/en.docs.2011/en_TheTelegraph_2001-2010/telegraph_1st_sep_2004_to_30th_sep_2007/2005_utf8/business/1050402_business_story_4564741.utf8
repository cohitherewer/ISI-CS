 Inflation rate drops 

 New Delhi, April 1 (PTI): In tune with the Centre?s expectation of a benign price level, the rate of inflation dropped to 5.11 per cent in the week ended March 19. 

 The decline was caused by cheaper primary articles like food and non-food items, cooking gas (LPG) and edible oils. The inflation rate stood at 4.53 per cent in the year-ago period. However, vegetables, certain manufactured items and fuel products like naphtha became costlier. 

 The wholesale price index (WPI) inflation had peaked at 8.74 per cent in August.

 Though global crude prices had crossed $57 a barrel, oil PSUs have not increased prices since November. As a result of this, the average price increase for 2004-05 would stay at benign levels. However, the picture could change in the new fiscal.

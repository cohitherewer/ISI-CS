 Calcutta, June 15: In a deviation from its earlier plan, Allahabad Bank has decided to merge its six regional rural banks (RRBs) into two separate entities instead of one.

 The regional rural banks sponsored by Allahabad Bank are mostly located in Uttar Pradesh.

 The bank has forwarded the proposal to the UP government for its approval.

 The trend in the banking sector is to merge rural banks into one entity so as to make them efficient.

 Bank sources said the UP government was against the idea of merging all the six rural banks into a single entity and had instead asked AllBank to convert them into two entities. The bank has agreed to the proposal.

 The six RRBs of AllBank are Baghirath Gramin Bank at Sitapur, Sariyu Gramin Bank at Lakhimpur, Sravasthi Gramin Bank at Bahraich, Chhatrasal Gramin Bank at Urai, Tulsi Gramin Bank at Banda Vrindhyavasini at Mirzapur ? all in Uttar Pardesh.

 AllBank has a seventh RRB in Madhya Pradesh, Sarda Gramin Bank, which will keep functioning as a single entity.

 ?We have divided these six RRBs into two groups which would be merged to form two separate entities. Cumulative business volumes of these entities stand at around Rs 3,000 crore while the total number of branches are around 430,? AllBank chairman O. N. Singh said.

 Total profits of these six banks was close to Rs 300 crore and its gross non performing assets (NPAs) stood at 12 per cent.

 Singh was talking to reporters on the sideline of the bank?s third annual general meeting held here today.

 ?It is not a regular practice among gramin banks to make provisions and write off NPAs. As a result of this, NPAs have always remained on the higher side. If the RRBs followed the provisioning norms as the commercial banks do then the NPA levels would have come down significantly,? explained bank officials.

 In a parallel development Allbank has shortlisted IIM Calcutta, IIM Ahmedabad and XLRI for formulating its human resource restructuring plan that will also involve productivity-linked incentive schemes for employees.

 Meanwhile, the bank has decided to invest close to Rs 600 crore for modernising and upgrading its 1935 branches. The bank intends to spend Rs 100 crore each year.

 The bank has also appointed Ernst amp; Young as a consultant for formulating the business plan for its ailing subsidiary AllBank Finance Ltd. 

 ?We have approached Sebi for a merchant banking licence and would also firm up plans of entering insurance business,? Singh added.

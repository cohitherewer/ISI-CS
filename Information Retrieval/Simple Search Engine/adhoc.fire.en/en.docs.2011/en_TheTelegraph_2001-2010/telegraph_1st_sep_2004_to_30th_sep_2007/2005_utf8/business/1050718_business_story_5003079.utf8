 Andhra Cement to retire loans

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, July 17: Andhra Cement will retire its high-cost debt in the next three months. Only then will the board decide whether to sell the company or retain it and expand further.

 Andhra Cement chairman G.P. Goenka told The Telegraph, We are currently engaged in the debt retiring exercise. Once that is done, the board will decide whether to sell the firm or improve its capacity.

 Earlier, reports said some of the big names in the cement industry ? both domestic and foreign ? had been eyeing the Duncan-Goenka group company. But no deal had been clinched.

 The company has asked the Industrial Development Bank of India to work out a roadmap for retiring the high-cost debt. The total debt is around Rs 30 crore. Andhra Cement, with a capacity of 1.4 million tonnes, has a turnover of Rs 180-Rs 200 crore.

 Markets are rife with speculation of Andhra Cements selloff. Goenka, however, rules out the buzz.

 Asked whether he has got any offer for Andhra Cement, Goenka said, There is no such offer right now. If any offer comes to us, we will have to go through it in detail to see whether it is favourable to us or not.

 However, analysts feel that the companys move to clean up its balancesheet is a step towards selloff. The company can fetch better prices if its financials are strong, they added.

 Goenka said he is trying to revive all group firms through debt restructuring or infusing fresh equity for capacity expansion. The group comprises eight firms with the flagship being Duncans Industries Ltd. The other seven are Star Paper, Andhra Cement, NRC, Unimers, Gujarat Carbon, Stone India and Consolidated Fibres amp; Chemicals Limited.

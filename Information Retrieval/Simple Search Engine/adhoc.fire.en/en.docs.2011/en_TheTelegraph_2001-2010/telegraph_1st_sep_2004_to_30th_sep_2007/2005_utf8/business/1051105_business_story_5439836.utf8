 Tata Steel, Infy in rating feat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov 4: International credit rating agency Standard amp; Poors on Thursday raised its foreign currency ratings on steel major Tata Steel and computer software company Infosys Technologies above the countrys sovereign rating in a widespread ratings action that included 25 companies spread across Asia and Latin America.

 The ratings action was primarily the result of S amp;Ps revised outlook on the transfer and convertibility risk with regard to the companies access to foreign exchange needed for debt servicing.

 For companies like Tata Steel, which has, in recent months, announced a plan to set up a series of multi-billion dollar steel projects in the states of Jharkhand, Orissa and Chhattisgarh, the forex rating upgrade will come as a big boost as it forays into the global financial markets for loans. S amp;P upgraded Tata Steels foreign currency rating by two notches above Indias sovereign rating from BB+ to BBB with a stable outlook.

 Therefore, Tata Steel is now in the investment grade for any foreign currency debt issuance, the company said in an immediate response.

 S amp;P has commented that among other factors, the two Indian companies are well insulated from direct and indirect sovereign risks since they demonstrate moderate leverage, strong free cash flow generation and a competitive business profile.

 S amp;P has undertaken the re-rating as a part of the exercise to upgrade 10 companies in Asia beyond the sovereign ceiling.

 S amp;P said the upgradation of the ratings were undertaken as countries under political and economic stress are considered less likely to restrict non-sovereign entities increased access to the foreign exchanged needed to service debt.

 This means that certain non-sovereign entities that are considered well insulated from direct and indirect sovereign risks may achieve a foreign currency rating that exceeds the sovereign foreign currency ratings, S amp;P said.

 This announcement is an important milestone and reflects Tata Steels competitive position in the industry. This will enable the company to access global funds for executing its growth projects in the future. Tata Steel is committed to create a sustainable long-term shareholders value and become a significant steel player in the region, said managing director B. Muthuraman.

 The rating will enable Tata Steel to access larger investor base and raise foreign currency funds efficiently, Koushik Chatterjee, vice-president (finance), added. S amp;P said the forex rating upgrade follows a review of transfer and convertibility risk in these markets.

 Infosys Technologies perceivably sits on a cash mountain and may require cash only to bid for companies on sale. Otherwise much of its expansion is funded through internal accruals. Both the Indian companies are also insulated because they have strong forex accruals from exports.

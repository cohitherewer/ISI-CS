 Pay order for Reliance Info

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan 3: The Supreme Court today rejected Reliance?s plea that it did not have money to pay BSNL and could only give a bank guarantee. 

 A division bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S. B. Sinha ordered Reliance Infocomm to pay, within a week, Rs 84.7 crore to BSNL as ?access deficit charges?, rejecting Reliances plea to allow it to furnish a bank guarantee for that amount.

 Out of BSNLs demand of Rs 182.7 crore, Reliance has already paid Rs 98 crore after an order of Delhi High Court and another order of the Supreme Court. However, the company had pleaded that it could only furnish a bank guarantee for the remaining amount.

 The apex court also made it clear that if Reliance did not pay the money within a week according to todays order, BSNL would be free to disconnect its service.

 The case has come before the Supreme Court after BSNL contended that Reliance was passing on international calls as local ones to BSNL, thus evading revenue.

 The apex court made it clear in todays order that Reliance had to pay the entire demand of Rs 182.7 crore and the case would be heard by Delhi High Court on January 13. 

 The high court would go into the merits of the case whether BSNLs total demand of over Rs 300 crore was correct and justified and would also determine whether Reliance Infocomm had passed on international calls as local ones to BSNL .

 Harish Salve, senior counsel for Reliance, argued that the company has calculated the default to be only Rs 29 crore and as it has already paid Rs 98 crore. It should be allowed to secure the outstanding amount of Rs 84.7 crore through bank guarantees. 

 Former attorney-general Soli Sorabjee, appearing for BSNL, contended that this question should be heard by the high court as it involved the merits of the case ? an issue not before the Supreme Court. The apex court made it clear that the high court should deliver its judgment on the matter by January 31.

 On December 3, the Supreme Court had asked Reliance Infocomm to pay up, within four weeks, the entire demand of Rs 182.7 crore. However, during todays proceedings, Reliance argued that it could only give a bank guarantee and also contended that BSNL had to pay it back the ?excess money? it had paid.

 Calcutta, Aug. 14: E-commerce transactions in India are expected to grow to Rs 2300 crore in the next financial year from Rs 570 crore in 2004-05, registering an increase of over 300 per cent.

 Apart from the online demand for railway or airline tickets, buying books, music, apparels, jewellery, home tools, toys and beauty products and booking hotels over the net are also on the rise.

 The Internet and Online Association (IOAI) estimates that the average number of transactions will increase to 795000, which is an 80 per cent growth over last year. The average transaction value will be around Rs 1100. Internet users are expected to cross 100 million by March 2008.

 According to a study conducted by IOAI, of the 25 million Internet users in the country, 48 per cent shop online.

 Around 55 per cent of those who visit e-commerce sites shop online. Also, an equal number are ?regular shoppers? ? those who have made commercial transactions more than once a year.

 While major metros like Mumbai and Delhi have emerged as winners, smaller cities like Ahmedabad, Jaipur, Nasik and Kanpur have made it to the top slot in specific categories.

 Mumbai has raced ahead with 24 per cent share of the total online shopping, except in the jewellery category, where the top slot has been bagged by Delhi.

 The growth estimates are justified by the fact that as high as 11 per cent make a maximum single transaction of more than Rs 10,000, 21 per cent between Rs 500 and Rs 1000, 39 per cent between Rs 1000 and Rs 5000 and 13 per cent between Rs 5000 and Rs 10000.

 Sixty-seven per cent have shopped online in the past three months. Fifty-three per cent have shopped online more than five times while 27 per cent have transacted more than 10 times.

 Ninety-six per cent of online shoppers have used the Internet for more than one year and 65 per cent have been using the medium for more than five years.

 Eighty-nine per cent of online shoppers use the Internet for more than five hours a week and 42 per cent for more than 20 hours a week.

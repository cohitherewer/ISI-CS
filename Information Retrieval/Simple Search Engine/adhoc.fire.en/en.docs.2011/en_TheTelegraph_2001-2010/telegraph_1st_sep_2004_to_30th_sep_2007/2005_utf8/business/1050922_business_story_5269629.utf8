 Blow to tobacco units

 New Delhi, Sept. 21 (PTI): The Supreme Court has rejected the claims of small manufacturing units for tobacco majors ? ITC and Godfrey Philips ? for refund of excise duty paid by them under a notification first exempting the new cigarette units in north-eastern region of such levy and then withdrawing the same.

 A bench comprising Justices Ruma Pal and Tarun Chatterjee upheld the provision of Finance Act 2003 empowering the government to recover the excise duty for the period, which was earlier counted as an exemption period.

 The bench ruled that the competence of Parliament and the state legislature to repeal or amend or supercede an exemption notification was unquestionable so also the power to give retrospective effect to it.

 Rejecting the arguments of cigarette manufacturers, the court said consequences of withdrawal of exemption notification would follow, including the recovery of excise duties refunded or paid.

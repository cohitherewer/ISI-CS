 New Delhi, Sept. 21: ONGC plans to invest Rs 10,000 crore in oil exploration and production within the country during the current financial year. 

 At the the annual general meeting today, the board decided that the company can borrow up to Rs 66,000 crore to fund acquisitions of oilfields and exploration blocks overseas and other ventures.

 While ONGC?s paid-up capital and cash reserves add up to Rs 46,000 crore, its borrowing capacity has been fixed at Rs 20,000 crore above this limit.

 The Rs 10,000-crore investment has been earmarked for exploration as well as the development of existing fields. Around Rs 4,000 crore will be spent entirely on fresh exploration in the offshore and onland basins. 

 ONGC chairman Subir Raha said the company would invest Rs 3,300 crore in Assam in the next three years to restore the production of crude to 3 million tonnes from 1.5 million tonnes.

 Raha added that ONGC will bring into commercial production three of the country?s offshore fields over the next 18 months. The company plans to raise output by 13 per cent to 30 million tonnes of crude oil by 2009-10.

 ?After many years, ONGC is engaged in bringing new offshore fields into production. In the next 18 months, a field in eastern offshore and two fields in western offshore will go into production,? he said. The company also hopes to deliver Indias first deep water gas by April 2006, he added.

 He said the recovery from the Mumbai High fields had improved from 27 per cent to 31 per cent. Besides, the Mehsana fields in Gujarat were producing oil at an 11-year high, he said. 

 Raha said ONGC has added over 300 million barrels of oil and oil equivalent gas to the country?s in-place reserves over the last year and this trend would be maintained in the future.

 He said ONGC was working on opening up five new hydrocarbon basins in the country, including Bengal, Vindhyas, Kutch, Andaman and Nicobar and the Himalayan foreland. 

 Raha said British Gas has shown an interest in taking a participating interest in three ONGC exploration blocks in the offshore Krishna-Godavri basin. These blocks were awarded to ONGC in the earlier rounds of the new exploration licensing policy.

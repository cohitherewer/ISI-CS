 PMO bridle on steel spiral

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Costly proposition 

 New Delhi, April 22: The Prime Minister?s office has stepped in to control the steel price spiral. 

 The PMO held an inter-ministerial meeting on Thursday, when it was decided that the government should try to hold the steel price line.

 Sources said the meeting, which was attended by senior officials from the ministries of steel, finance and the Planning Commission, felt that steel-makers should be persuaded not to increase prices as it was hurting industrial revival.

 Besides, the cost of the government?s highway construction project and the rail corridor was going up because of costly steel structurals. 

 According to government officials, the finance ministry has been toying with the idea of reducing customs duty on steel imports, including scrap, as a measure to curb the price escalation. This might be implemented if there are any further rise in the domestic price.

 Last month, steelmakers had increased prices by about Rs 2,000 a tonne. A four per cent increase in excise duties on steel also impacted prices considerably. Costly steel, coupled with the rise in prices of petro-products, is believed to have led to inflationary pressures in the economy.

 A gap between imported and domestic steel prices gave local companies the leeway to raise prices.

 However, detractors within the user-industries feel that due to the rise in steel prices, their input costs are going up, putting them at a disadvantage in the global white goods and machinery market.

 They claim that steel firms are profiteering by taking advantage of the bullish sentiments in the economy.

 Flat-steel sales have recorded an 11 per cent growth this year, while long sales have been almost stagnant, going up by less than 1 per cent. 

 Users complain that while global steel prices have gone up 30-35 per cent, Indian steel prices have increased over 100 per cent in the last two years.

 Steel-makers like the Tatas, SAIL, Essar, Ispat and Jindals have justified the hikes, saying input costs have gone up in multiples of 100 per cent in the past year.

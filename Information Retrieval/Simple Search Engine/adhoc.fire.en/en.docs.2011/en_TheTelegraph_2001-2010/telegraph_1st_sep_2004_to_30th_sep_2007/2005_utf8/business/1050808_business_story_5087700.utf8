 Global uptrend buoys domestic steel firms

 SAMBIT SAHA

 LONG ON HOPE

 Calcutta, Aug. 7: Global steel prices have started firming up even as domestic companies made their products cheaper for the third time in a row last week.

 According to the latest report of the World Steel Dynamics (WSD), prices have firmed up in all major economies ? the US, China and western Europe. World export prices, which have a strong bearing on domestic rates, are also hardening, it said.

 This bodes well for the domestic industry. Local players feel that last weeks cuts could be the last in August ? and for the near future.

 There is always a lag with international prices. The effect will be clear in a month or two. The inventory position is also improving, an industry official said.

 In the US, spot prices of hot-rolled coil are up $10-$20 per tonne over levels seen two weeks ago.

 Prices to steel-service centres, which bottomed out at $420-$440 per tonne free on board (f..b), are now hovering around $440-$460 per tonne.

 With US steel production down, imports lower and users having eliminated inventories, spot flat-rolled prices in the US will rally, the report said.

 One indication of this has come from Nucor, the largest steel producer in the US which announced a $30-per-tonne hike for September deliveries.

 In China, too, spot hot-rolled band prices have rallied in the past four weeks to $480 a tonne from $444 a tonne, though it is still below the high of $678 a tonne.

 WSD expects export of finished steel products to decline to 1.2-1.5 million tonnes per month from 2.2 million tonnes a month in June.

 A similar trend is also being witnessed in western Europe, where prices have gone up around $40-a-tonne in the past one month. With imports down and production cut, the EU steel mills are hoping for another hike in the fourth quarter (October-December).

 If export prices are an indication, European, Russian and Chinese mills have witnessed a recovery in prices as well.

 Given the steel production cuts in the US, western Europe and Russia and talk of lower production in Japan and South Korea, WSD expects world hot-rolled band export prices to rally in the coming months. The fact that users probably haveless inventories now will help matters.

 However, WSD has cautioned that the larger the rebound, the greater the risk that the rally will dissipate.

 Back home, hot-rolled coil prices are now hovering around $520-$525. The last price cut was around $10-35.

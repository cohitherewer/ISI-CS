 Little pressure on drugs

 companies only see merit in patents bill while ngos oppose 

 it tooth and nail 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Ramkrishna: Upbeat

 Calcutta, March 18: The new product patent regime is unlikely to push retail drug prices through the roof.

 Only selected drugs, which were discovered after 1995 and are sold in the market, can be patented. However, such drugs are very few in number and will have no material impact on the market.

 ?The existing products, which are being manufactured in the country, will continue to be off patent in India. Therefore, there will be an abundant supply of these products at current prices,? Pfizer senior director (corporate affairs) S. Ramkrishna said.

 The company, which spends more than other pharmaceutical companies for innovation ($7.9 billion in 2004), said the fear of price hike was unjustified.

 Like many other pharma multinationals (MNCs), Pfizer will be a beneficiary of the new patent regime. The company will be able to bring in patented products without infringing the intellectual property rights.

 MNCs said Indian pharmaceutical companies have copied their drugs by the reverse engineering process and produced cheap substitute for the local market.

 The new patent regime will put an end to this. As a result, Indian companies will not be able to copy new patented drugs.

 Since a new molecule generally takes 8-10 years to come to the market after it gets a patent, the ones that received patent after 1995 are yet to hit the market.

 Ramkrishna said not more than 20 per cent of the market would be patented after 2015 ? a decade after the new regime sets in the country.

 ?A patented drug is costlier since a large amount of investment goes behind developing a new molecule. According to an estimate, it generally takes $1 billion to develop a new drug for the market,? an observer said.

 MNC pharma companies were wary of bringing frontier drugs since they could be copied in India and the originator would not be able to recover the huge development cost.

 India had a process patent. Anyone who can induce some changes in the manufacturing process was granted new patent.

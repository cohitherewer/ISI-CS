 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 15: Bank of Baroda (BoB) today announced an ambitious technology-enabled business transformation project that seeks to provide its domestic and international customers seamless service. Among others, the comprehensive project includes core banking for 1,919 domestic branches and 55 others spread in 20 countries.

 The mandate for implementing this project has been bagged by Hewlett-Packard. The entire project cost is estimated between Rs 500 crore and Rs 1000 crore. 

 Briefing newspersons here today, BoB chairman Anil Khandelwal said the project would enable the bank?s 25 million customers to avail services anytime, anywhere throughout the world using multiple delivery channels that range from Internet banking to call centres, ATMs and transaction kiosks. 

 When completed, the project will deliver a uniform, portal-based IT infrastructure covering both its domestic and international operations.

 HP will implement and manage the architecture, including core banking, phone banking, Internet banking, delivery channel integration, risk and performance management, customer relationship management, data warehousing, global treasury, human resources management system (HRMS) and cheque truncation system. 

 HP will also draw on its extensive network of alliances with major players such as Cisco, Crisil , Infosys Technologies, Microsoft, Oracle, Reuters and other leading independent software vendors for the integrated deployment of more than 40 applications. 

 As part of the contract, HP will also design, build and manage Tier III data centres that will host the storage and connectivity infrastructure for the bank and also provide disaster recovery and business continuity solutions. Additionally, HP will design, deploy and manage the bank?s network implementation.

 The entire project will be completed in five years and will be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, while 650 branches will come under the core banking solution, which will also include the regulatory aspects comprising real time gross settlement (RTGS) system and anti-money laundering systems, in the second phase, 1300 branches will be covered.

 ?We are committed to offering our domestic and international customers a total customer experience with world-class banking solutions. Through this initiative, we will be able to provide our customers with new options and choices that will make it easier and more convenient for them to do business with us, anytime, anywhere across the globe,? Khandelwal said.

 HP officials explained that the uniqueness of the project is that it provides unified core banking solution across domestic and international banking. Further, the project covers all facets of the enterprise such as regulatory and delivery channel requirements and employee-related requirements.

 The public offering of Bank of Baroda (BoB) is likely to hit the markets in the second quarter of this fiscal. Around 7.1 crore shares will be offered and this will bring down the governments holding in the bank to around 54 per cent.

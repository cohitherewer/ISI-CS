 Core sector growth declines

 New Delhi, March 22 (PTI): Pulled down by deceleration in crude oil production, refined petroleum products, coal and electricity, the infrastructure industry index reported a 0.6 per cent contraction in February this year compared with a whopping 12.2 per cent growth a year ago.

 Of the six key infrastucture industries, only cement and steel managed to remain in the positive territory in February, according to the data released by the government today.

 Growth in the infrastructure sector has been on the decline since November 2004. The infrastructure index posted a 5 per cent growth in November and thereafter fell to 3.6 per cent in December and 1.9 per cent in January.

 The pack-of-six posted a lower 4.6 per cent growth in April-February this fiscal compared with 6.5 per cent growth in the corresponding period of 2003-04.

 In February, crude oil production fell by 5 per cent, while refined petroleum product output was down 3.5 per cent. Coal production was down 0.3 per cent and electricity generation was lower by 0.9 per cent in February when compared with the year-ago period.

 Crude oil production slumped to 2.595 million tonnes in February this year against production of 2.731 million tonnes a year ago. Refinery throughput was 9.485 million tonnes against 9.829 million tonnes in February 2004.

 Coal output at 33.7 million tonnes was a shade lower than 33.8 million tonnes in the year-ago period. The country generated 45958.4 million units of electricity in February, marginally lower than 46382 million units the previous year.

 Cement production, however, rose 1.3 per cent to 10.97 million tonnes and steel output expanded 1.7 per cent to 3.305 million tonnes. In April-February, the growth in petroleum refined products and finished steel contracted, while other sectors posted higher growth rates.

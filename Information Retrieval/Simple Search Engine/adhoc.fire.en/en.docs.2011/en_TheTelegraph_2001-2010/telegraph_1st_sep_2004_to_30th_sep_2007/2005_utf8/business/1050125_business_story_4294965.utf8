 United Airlines chief sees autumn take-off

 Chicago, Jan. 24 (Reuters): The chief executive of United Airlines said he expects the carrier to emerge from bankruptcy in the autumn, the Chicago Tribune reported in its Sunday edition.

 United Air?s Glenn Tilton told the newspaper the airline ?will emerge from bankruptcy in the fall a different company?.

 The second largest US carrier, a unit of UAL Corp, has been in bankruptcy for more than two years, longer than many in the aviation industry had expected.

 ?It?s going to be a rush, it?s going to be an absolute rush,? Tilton said of the airline?s efforts to finish up its reorganisation.

 United has lost more than $4 billion since entering bankruptcy in December 2002.

 Labour groups have already approved $2.56 billion in concessions to help the carrier restructure, and the airline is seeking another $725 million in annual labour cost reductions by the end of January.

 Like most other big airlines, United has been battered by soaring fuel costs, low revenue and competition from low-cost carriers. 

 Several major carriers this week reported heavy fourth-quarter losses, including Delta Air Lines Inc, which came in with a $2.2-billion loss.

 United won court approval on Friday for another three months to file its reorganisation plan without interference from other parties. The current extension was due to expire on January 31.

 The carrier said the extension would allow it to continue ?without disruption? efforts to secure final cuts from labour and finish up other restructuring agreements.

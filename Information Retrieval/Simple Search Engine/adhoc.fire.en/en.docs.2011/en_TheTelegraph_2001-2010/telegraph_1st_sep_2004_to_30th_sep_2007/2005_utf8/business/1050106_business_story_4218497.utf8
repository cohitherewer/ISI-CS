 Stake sparks in Ambani duel

 OUR BUREAU

 Jan. 5: The war of words between the Ambani brothers intensified today with sources close to Anil revealing that the younger sibling requested the board to gift away 12 per cent of Reliance Industries? (RIL) shares held by a clutch of group entities to shareholders.

 The new disclosure about the December 27 board meeting comes days after the Anil camp provided details of how RIL directors ignored his proposal for a bonus, instead of the buyback that they announced at a price of Rs 570.

 Sources close to Mukesh claimed it was Anil who had suggested that the shares be kept with a petroleum trust and four unnamed companies for treasury purposes when Reliance Petroleum was merged with RIL in 2002.

 The suggestion to provide 12 per cent of the stock as bonus shares in the current scenario would defeat the objective of providing a safety net to shareholders, the sources said. This would happen because extra shares add to floating stock ? the amount available for trading in the market ? and pull down the price. By contrast, a buyback will give investors an exit option and steady prices.

 In any case, shares of promoters and ?persons acting in concert? would not be bought back, RIL had written to exchanges after the board meeting. Anil was also reported to have sought a buyback price of Rs 450, instead of the Rs 570 that was agreed upon. Mukesh?s aides say settling for a lower figure would have pounded the stock.

 ?At this juncture, when RIL shares are being hammered by a sustained systematic disinformation campaign, the board of Reliance Industries felt there is a need for a safety net for those wanting to sell shares. The offer has to be higher than the current market price. This is in consonance with the management?s view that shares are undervalued,? the sources added.

 Today?s salvo, like the previous one, was fired under the guise of protecting the interests of the firm?s 3 million shareholders ? who have watched the value of their stocks melt as the brothers exchanged hot words over control.

 Slur shadow

 The Ambani shadow boxing hit a new pitch today with Reliance Industries putting out a release in which ?unnamed and undisclosed sources? have been accused of running a ?malicious campaign? to tarnish the firm and its leadership. The statement, which does not name Anil, follows today?s reports about 4.7 per cent of RIL?s equity being allegedly clubbed with the promoters? holding. It reiterates there has been no shuffling of equity.

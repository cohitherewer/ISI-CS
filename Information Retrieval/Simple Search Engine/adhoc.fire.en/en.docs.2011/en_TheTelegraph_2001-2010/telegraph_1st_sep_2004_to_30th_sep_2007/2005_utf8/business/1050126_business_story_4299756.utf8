 Flight path for newcomers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 25: The government today formally issued guidelines for operations of Indian carriers on international routes. The key requirement remains that they must have a fleet of 20 and a five-year flying experience at home.

 However airlines may lose their international rights if they scale back domestic operations in future.

 This has been done to ensure that local airlines do not merely try to turn into international carriers, neglecting their domestic operations, especially flights to remote stations in the northeast. 

 Among other rules, the government has laid down that Indian carriers would lose the right to fly on a route for two years if they get permission but are unable to use it.

 The move will ensure that there is no ?route squatting? by eligible airlines. However, it also means that Indian Airlines (IA) and Air-India (A-I), which are in the process of a long-drawn aircraft purchase plan, will have to wait till they get their planes to seek new rights. 

 Officials, however, said a minimum size of the aircraft may be laid down later. The number of years of flying experience, too, could be brought down in future policy reviews.

 Besides, all airlines should have an Air Operators? Permit from the ministry of home affairs and a clearance from the aircraft-acquisition committee. 

 The two private airlines which fit the bill ? Jet and Sahara ? will be allowed to fly on all international routes, except the Gulf. However, even these will be opened to them after three years. 

 Officials said routes will be allocated after due consideration to the operational plans of A-I and IA. All eligible carriers will be asked to submit their operational plans in the first and third quarter of each year. At any point of time, operational plan of up to a year will be considered for route/traffic right allocation.

 Bidders rush to catch airport update flight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 2: The aviation sector today saw hectic lobbying by the bidders for the airport update project ahead of the empowered group of ministers meeting on Monday. 

 The meeting will examine commercial bids from technically qualified bidders for the modernisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports. 

 While some of the bidders have cautioned against dilution of guidelines, one has demanded review of technical evaluation.

 Civil aviation secretary Ajay Prasad said the process of modernisation of the two airports is in the final stage. 

 The empowered group of ministers will decide on technically selected bidders in its meeting on Monday. It has been a torturous and slow process, but we are progressing (modernisation of airports), said Prasad.

 The bidding process ran into an air pocket with a few participants complaining about the criteria that resulted in only two bidders qualifying. The companies left out are lobbying with the government to conduct a fresh bidding.

 The inter-ministerial group, headed by the civil aviation secretary, considered the recommendations of the inter-ministerial committee of officials on technical evaluation of the bids by Airplan. It would send its report to the empowered group of ministers, which in turn would pave the way for opening of the commercial bids in the next few days.

 According to reports, the review committee has graded the bidders on technical qualification criteria on a scale of 100 and only two aspirants ? Reliance and GMR ? have cleared the stipulated level of 80.

 Even as the inter-ministerial group meet was on, sources among bidders started questioning the rationale of a possible dilution of technical evaluation criteria to 70 to include some more bidders.

 Six consortia, including those led by Reliance Energy, Essel group, Sterlite and GMR, are the major bidders for the Rs 5,400-crore modernisation programme of the two airports.

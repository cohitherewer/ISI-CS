 New Delhi, April 28: The revenues of Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd surged to Rs 8,000 crore even as the company saw its net profit leap 132 per cent to Rs 1,439 crore during the year ended March 31 from Rs 619 crore in the previous year.

 Bharti?s revenue grew by 61 per cent over last year. 

 During the final quarter of 2004-05 (January-March), revenues rose by 49 per cent at Rs 2,317 crore compared with Rs 1553 crore in the year-ago period.

 Net profit also grew substantially at Rs 437 crore, a 44 per cent jump over the last quarter of 2004 at Rs 304 crore.

 Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman and group managing director of BTVL, said, ?The growth in revenues is a reflection of efficient execution of our capabilities and operational efficiencies.?

 Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) grew by 80 per cent at Rs 3,007 crore as against Rs 1,671 crore a year ago.

 BTVL, which started its operations in 1999 with two circles and a market share of 10.2 per cent, has expanded its operations to all the 23 circles in the country. Its market share is now 21.2 per cent among the wireless telecom players. The nearest competitors in this segment are Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd/Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd with 20.3 per cent market share and Reliance Infocomm with 20.2 per cent.

 Among the operators using the global system for mobile communications (GSM) like Hutch and Idea, the company holds 26.8 per cent market share.

 Pre-paid customers 

 Mittal said the strict verification drive ordered by the department of telecommunications (DoT) had slowed down the intake of pre-paid subscribers in the last two months. 

 ?But the good news is that the process has started to show some benefits as well. The churn is getting blocked and, in a few months, the market will get used to the right process of verification. This is also allowing the operator to establish a relationship with the customers. So far the operators have had no relationship with a face and name and this will help us to do gross selling, retention and loyalty programmes. Whatever momentary slow down was there due to strict verification drive is fast coming back to normal,? said Mittal

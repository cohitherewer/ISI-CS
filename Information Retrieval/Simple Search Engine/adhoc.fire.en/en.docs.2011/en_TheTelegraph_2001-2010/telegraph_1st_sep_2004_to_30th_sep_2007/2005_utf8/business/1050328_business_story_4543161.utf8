 Q amp;A

 Tax token

 I am 66 years old, retired and invalid. My annual income is Rs 1,75,000 from various sources, including my pension, widower pension, interest income and Varistha Pension Bima Yojana. Do I have to pay income tax for the assessment year 2005-06?

 A.N. Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Assuming that the pension you receive is from your employer and in lieu of salary for which you will be entitled to standard deduction of Rs 30,000, your tax liability comes to Rs 18,000. Taking into account the tax rebate available to senior citizens, which is up to Rs 20,000, you will not be required to pay any tax. However, if you are not entitled to standard deduction, your tax liability will be Rs 6,500, after considering all tax exemptions.

 Rules of the game

 I am a senior citizen. Please clarify whether the existing rules for deductions and exemptions under section 80L and 88 will remain valid for the assessment year 2005-06? When will the new rules come into place? 

 K.K. Ghose, Calcutta

 The current deductions under section 80, including section 80L, the tax rebate under section 88 for investments and also the special rebate for senior citizens and women assesses will be available for the assessment year 2005-06. The new rules will come into force after the finance bill is passed and will be valid for the next assessment year.

 Pay order

 I am a retired pension holder. My taxable income for the financial year 2003-04 was Rs 67,000 after considering all applicable deductions. As my date of birth is January 10, 1940, I did not pay any tax considering that I have attained 65 on January 10, 2004, and am entitled to section 88B rebate. However, the income tax department is now demanding that I pay tax on my income. Please advise.

 Biraj Chatterjee, by e-mail

 The senior citizen benefit is available after the completion of 65 years of age. It?s only after January 10, 2005, that you have become a senior citizen and is entitled to the benefit of section 88B. Thus, you will have to pay tax according to the demands of the income tax department.

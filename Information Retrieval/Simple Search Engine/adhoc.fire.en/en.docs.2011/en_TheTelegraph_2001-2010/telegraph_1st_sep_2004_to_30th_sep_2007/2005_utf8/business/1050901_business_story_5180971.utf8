The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Recharged Eveready to take on China

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 31: Eveready Industries is relying on its upgraded IT infrastructure to combat competition from Chinese batteries and flashlights.

 The company has integrated its distribution network spread over 68 locations. This includes eight factories, 15 branch offices and warehouses. This facilitates the company to link up its planning, distribution and online inventory.

 Senior general manager (national carbon plant unit) Ajit Ghatak said, Chinese batteries and flashlights had earlier flooded the market. But they could not make a dent in the market because of inferior product quality. However, these companies can also make better quality products, which will be priced lower than ours. We have to gear up to meet this competition.

 Eveready sells around one billion batteries annually. It has a 45 per cent market share in batteries and 85 per cent in flashlights.

 The company has invested Rs 5.5 crore and will implement the Oracle e-business suite in three phases.

 We are moving from being a people-oriented company to a process-oriented one. We expect to revive costs in the next 18 months, general manager-IT Arup Choudhary said. The applications will predict changes in the market, manage flow of information, make processes uniform and reduce duplication of efforts.

 The company expects to reduce operating costs and also improve its forecast accuracy from 60 per cent to 85 per cent.

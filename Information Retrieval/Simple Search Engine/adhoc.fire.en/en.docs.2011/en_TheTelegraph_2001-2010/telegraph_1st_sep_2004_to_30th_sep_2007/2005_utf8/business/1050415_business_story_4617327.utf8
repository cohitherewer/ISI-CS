 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, April 14: To increase the mobile subscriber base, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) will focus on creating a complete ecosystem to include manufacturing, distribution and after-sales service of CDMA handsets.

 ?We have already initiated a capacity-building process in the city with new sites being added. This will take the capacity of the network to 70,000 subscribers,? Calcutta Telephones chief general manager S. P. Chakravarty said. 

 ?The Bengal circle also has a capacity of 50,000 subscribers and we are thinking of strengthening the network,? he added.

 Of the 1.5 million CDMA users across the country, around 22,000 are in Calcutta.

 Till now, there has been a sharp focus on the GSM front in cities, while growth in the CDMA segment has come from the interiors.

 CalTel, however, did not outline the amount of funds that will flow into the eastern circles of the total outlay of Rs 78,000 crore set aside by BSNL.

 BSNL has also identified the telecom factory units at Calcutta and Mumbai to set up after-sales service and repair centres.

 Calcutta telecom factory chief general manager R. P. Nigam said, ?Our factory, along with the Mumbai unit, has been identified as the location for the fixed wireless terminal repair centre. Both the centres, which will require an investment of Rs 90 lakh, is expected to be commissioned in June.?

 The service centre will cater to the complaints of CDMA phone users across the country. Currently, the service is being managed by handset manufacturers LG and Hyundai.

 The telecom major has also identified three telecom factories at Calcutta, Mumbai and Jabalpur to focus on developing its manufacturing capabilities through joint ventures.

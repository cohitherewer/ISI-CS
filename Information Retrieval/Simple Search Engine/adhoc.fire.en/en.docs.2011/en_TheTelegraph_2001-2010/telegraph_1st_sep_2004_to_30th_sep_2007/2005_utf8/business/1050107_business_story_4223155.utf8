 Sebi data belies FII sale fears

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 6: Foreign institutional investors (FIIs), contrary to what many feared, were not the biggest villains in Wednesday?s 192-point sensex slide show.

 According to figures released by Sebi on their pattern of investments, these funds dumped stocks worth Rs 57 crore ? hardly an amount that would maul markets.

 However, it was in the futures segment of exchanges, where they offloaded worth more than Rs 812.73 crore. Much of the selling is believed to have come from hedge funds, in the index futures of derivatives. 

 Spot purchase contracts were a more modest Rs 175.09 crore, indicating that the foreign institutions are turning bearish on the Indian stock markets. They are not too excited about futures either, with their plans to sell Rs 302.81 crore ranged against a buy order of Rs 172.33 crore.

 All eyes were on Sebi?s FII figures for Wednesday, but to the surprise of most, they were aggressive sellers, by Rs 535.40 crore, in the debt segment. This is a sign that rates in other countries are more attractive than those in India.

 Not only are interest rates expected to go up in the US, the icing on the cake for debt market investors is that the value of the dollar is also on the way up, a dealer said.

 In an uneasy coincidence, Deutsche Bank put out a downgrade report on India as local markets were in a tailspin on Wednesday. 

 ?India outperformed other emerging markets in December and we are now downgrading the country to neutral. 

 ?The decision is based purely on valuation concerns but we are also worried by the strength of flows running into the Indian market. These are beginning to look climactic,? Deutsche said.

 Nath calls for Asian unity at WTO meet

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: India today said south Asian nations should work closely on WTO issues to ensure solidarity during multilateral trade negotiations.

 At Geneva, there are united voices and that is why we are heard... We must ensure that this continues, Union commerce minister Kamal Nath told a Saarc business leaders conference organised by the Ficci.

 We should strive for a common platform and a common approach, for that is the common goal. All members must work together in tandem with each other to improve the quality of life, Nath said.

 He also said regional integration and economic co-operation are building blocks to multilateralism. I dont know why people think there is any contradiction in building regional integration and multilateral ones. With the help of the former, the latter only gets strengthened.

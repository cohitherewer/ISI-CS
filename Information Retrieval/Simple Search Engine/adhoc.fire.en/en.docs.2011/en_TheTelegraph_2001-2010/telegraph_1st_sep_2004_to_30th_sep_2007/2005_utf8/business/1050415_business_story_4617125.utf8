 After years of sweat, a dream nest just next door

 Raima and Riya Sen have found their perfect home away from home

 The search took us through years of hard work and sweat, but we?ve finally found the right place ? even though it ended up being just next door to our parents? place!

 In the Mumbai suburb of Ruia Park, Juhu, we have been staying in a small one-bedroom flat that had been bought by my parents years ago. 

 Despite the size of the flat, we?ve had plenty of guests and managed rather comfortably to enjoy our small space. 

 But as it happens with everyone, too much proximity often leads to several problems. For example, if we all need to leave the house at the same time and require the bathroom, waiting for your turn ends up delaying everyone.

 The new place is just next door. Opportunity literally came knocking when our neighbours decided to sell their flat. We jumped at the idea and pooled in our resources, with a little help of course from our parents. 

 It?s a beautiful place ? completely bare at the moment though ? with three bedrooms, a large drawing room and a cute kitchen.

 The whole place has been broken down in order to change the look completely. 

 The designated interior designer is our mother (Moon Moon Sen) of course, who has got some really great ideas up her sleeve.

 Everything from the flooring, the extension of the drawing room, choosing our bedrooms and many more plans are in the making! In our heads, we?ve even got the colour palettes all sorted out for our respective bedrooms. 

 As for staying together, we?re both used to it since we?ve been living in Mumbai for ages now. 

 The biggest bonus, however, is the space our three little pups can now enjoy! Though we haven?t moved in yet, the three of them have got fairly acquainted with our new flat.

 Raimaspeak: I?ve already chosen the sea-facing room. Shades of blue are going to be my theme colour with aqua walls and denim bathroom tiles. 

 Riyaspeak: She doesn?t realise that my room?s so much more spacious than hers! My room?s just the opposite of Raima?s with the walls being painted in denim shades, wooden flooring and aqua bathroom tiles.

 Selloff ruled out in inland water corp

 New Delhi, June 19 (PTI): The Board of Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises has shot down the shipping ministrys proposal to privatise Central Inland Waterways Transport Corporation. 

 The ministry, which was in favour of selling the company, sought the boards opinion on the proposal by June-end so that it can go ahead with the sale by August this year.

 Last week, the board instead decided to go with the opinion of the advisers like ICICI to revive the company.

 The shipping ministry has also asked the board for a revival plan for Hindustan Shipyard Ltd and Hooghly Dock amp; Port Engineers Ltd as their order books are healthy.

 Both Hindustan Shipyard and Hooghly Dock were on the list of companies that the previous NDA government wanted to privatise.

 Central Inland Waterways Transport Corporation, on the other hand, had accumulated losses of around Rs 503.20 crore. It suffered a loss of Rs 48.50 crore in 2004-05 on a turnover of Rs 8.5 crore.

 The company has four chief areas of operation, out of which only one, river services, is being run on commercial lines.

 It is not being paid for maintaining Karimganj and Calcutta port terminals and development of 200 km of waterways in Sunderbans. 

 As part of the package the board has asked the company to shed excess workforce, which now stands at 1,080. It has also been asked to hive-off its Rajabagan dockyard to other ship builders.

 Mittal seals Ukraine deal for $4.8 bn

 Mittal: In high spirits

 Kiev, Oct. 24 (Reuters): Mittal Group, the worlds biggest steel producer, won a feverish auction to secure control of Ukraines biggest steel mill on Monday, a sale hailed by President Viktor Yushchenko as the start of a new economic era.

 Mittals offer of 24.2 billion hryvnias ($4.8 billion) for the Kryvorizshtal plant in central Ukraine came on top after nearly an hour of fast-moving competitive bidding with Industrial Group, controlled by Arcelor.

 Kryvorizshtal produces about 7 million tonnes of steel, which is 20 per cent of Ukraines entire metal output.

 The auction was seen as a key event in defining the reformist agenda of the administration, which was propelled to power by last years Orange Revolution rallies.

 The winning price far exceeded the $3 billion that Yushchenkos liberal administration had hoped to fetch in the new sell-off of the plant, which was designed to lure back Western investors made wary by turmoil during his first nine months in office.

 Analysts suggested Mittal may have paid too high a price.

 The amount we will receive for this company will be 20 per cent higher than all the proceeds received in all the years of the Ukrainian privatisation, a beaming Yushchenko told reporters after a signing ceremony with the winning company.

 What happened today shows Ukraine is capable of staging honest privatisations, observing all vital legal procedures.

 The proceedings, conducted in a small room in the presence of high-profile guests, were broadcast live on television.

 Dmitry Parfyonenko, deputy head of Ukraines privatisation agency, described the price as fantastic and unbelievable.

 Ukrainian LLC Smart Group, a third entrant with Russian links, dropped out of the bidding as prices for the 93.02 per cent stake in the steelmaker spiralled upward in the auction, ordered after the courts struck down last years original sale for $800 million. 

 Luring the West

 The sale was touted as a chance to attract Western investment, which had all but dried up during the chaotic term in office of the now-sacked Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.

 Prime Minister Yuri Yekhanurov, installed in office after Tymoshenko was dismissed to end months of infighting over privatisation policy, said the auction signalled a new start.

 We will do everything so that investors will realise how the climate has changed, he said.

 Finance minister Viktor Pynzenyk said part of the proceeds from the sale would be used to cover the 2006 budget deficit.

 But we will not go beyond a possible deficit of up to 2 per cent, Pynzenyk said. 

 The government intends to allow Mittal to make payment in hard currency, and it will not place the cash on the currency market all at once to avoid distorting the market, he said.

 Less than a year after taking office, Yushchenko is overseeing an economy growing at its slowest pace in five years ? 2.8 per cent in the first nine months of 2005.

 Throughout the campaign that ultimately led to his election last year, Yushchenko denounced as theft the original sale in June 2004 for $800 million, below other offers, to a group led by industrialists linked to Yushchenkos predecessor Leonid Kuchma.

 Courts declared that tender illegal.

 Yushchenko had vowed the sale would proceed despite calls by Parliament to halt the process. But he also promised an end to reprivatisaton, the watchword for a mass review of sell-offs that took place while Tymoshenko was in office.

 Industrial Group started the bidding with a sealed submission of about $2.5 billion ? against $2.08 billion for the other two entrants.

 Arcelor chief executive Guy Dolle issued a statement saying his firm had dropped out after the price exceeded levels deemed appropriate.

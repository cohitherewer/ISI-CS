 Lockheed gets $716 m contracts

 Washington, Jan. 1 (Reuters): Lockheed Martin Corp has received two US Air Force contracts totalling $716 million to continue work on its F/A-22 Raptor fighter jet, designed to be the worlds most capable, amid reports the $72 billion program may be scaled back sharply, the company said Friday.

 quot;These are contracts that will provide incremental funding to Lockheed Martin and our suppliers so we can continue work on Lot 5 aircraft, quot; the next batch of initial, low-rate production, Joseph Quimby, a company spokesman said.

 The Defense Department is planning to cut Air Force purchases of the Raptor, which would replace the F-15E Eagle as the top US air-superiority fighter, defense officials disclosed this week.

 Overall, the Pentagon is aiming to trim $60 billion in the next six years, mainly in weapons purchases, starting with $10 billion in the fiscal 2006 budget to be sent to Congress in February, government and industry officials said.

 The belt-tightening was ordered by the White House, eager to trim a federal deficit that now totals nearly $413 billion and offset higher-than-anticipated Iraq and Afghanistan war costs, now running at about $5 billion a month. 

 The radar-evading F/A-22 was originally conceived to fight the Soviet Union.

 Rupee gets a whack, stocks a thrashing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 5: The week started on a disappointing note for the financial markets. The sensex fell due to panic selling and the rupee plunged to a 15-month low against the dollar.

 After a two-day rally last week, the bellwhether index dipped 138 points today, while the rupee lost 14 paise against the greenback to close at 46.33. 

 The sensex opened moderately higher at 8965.83 and gradually rallied past the 9000- mark to hit an intra-day high of 9010.73. However, it soon slipped to the days low of 8803.37 and closed at 8823.31, reflecting a net loss of 138.30 points, or 1.54 per cent, from Fridays finish of 8961.61.

 The fall, which was initially triggered by profit booking at higher levels, was aggravated by a report that the Maharashtra government has asked financial institutions and bond houses to pay up stamp duty on their direct security deals done over the last 10 years. Rise in crude prices added to the jitters. The absence of fresh buying support in the final hours of the trading session hastened the slide.

 Brokers said petroleum and cement stocks bore the brunt of the selloff. Cement shares cracked under disappointing sales figures for the month of November. High crude prices led investors to dump oil scrips. 

 Mumbai High Courts decision to reserve its verdict on the petition seeking approval of the demerger of Reliance Industries till December 9 stoked selling in sensex heavy-weights, which pulled down all others with it.

 The rupee was under pressure from the start of trading ? it opened weaker by 10 paise at 46.27 per dollar than Fridays close. The rupee slid to an intra-day low of 46.37 but later recovered on statements made by finance minister P. Chidambaram that both the RBI and the government were watching the movement of the currency. It closed at 46.33.

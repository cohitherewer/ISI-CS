 Orissa sets terms for Rio Tinto

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Steely resolve 

 Calcutta, May 8: The Orissa government will take a fresh look at the London-based Rio Tintos proposal if the global mining giant agrees to sell iron ore in the domestic market only.

 Rio Tinto, the $2.2-billion company with global interests in copper, coal, diamond, aluminium, gold and other minerals, had entered into a joint venture with Orissa Mining Corporation (OMC) to develop two mines in 1995. 

 The two parties are now embroiled in litigation with OMC contending that the joint venture has ceased to exist. 

 The venture aimed at developing two mines ? Gandhamardan and Malangtuli ? and export bulk of the ore. 

 Now the state has changed its view with as many as 40 companies showing interest in setting up steel plants in Orissa. 

 ?If Rio Tinto comes up with a fresh proposal to develop mines for supplying to the domestic market only, we will look at it. But the state government will not allow any export,? Bhaskar Chatterjee, secretary, department of mining, and chairman of OMC, told The Telegraph. 

 Rio Tinto said it was committed to the state of Orissa. But the legal wrangle must come to an end.

 ?Unless the litigation is resolved, we cannot move forward,? a Rio Tinto official said.

 Industry sources said the company was not keen to go solo as the joint venture entailed two large deposits. However, the state government has now decided to offer these two mines to Posco to lure the Korean steel giant into setting up a $12-billion steel plant.

 ?No company will now get mining lease for exports. If Rio Tinto is looking for shipping out ore, it is unlikely to get the lease. Posco has been denied extra ore for export despite its investment commitment,? industry sources said.

 The Rio Tinto official hinted that with many steel plants coming up, the company might look at domestic sales.

 ?We will start with 2-5 million tonnes,? he said. 

 On exploring opportunities in other states like Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, the official said Rio Tinto was prepared to consider that route even though Orissa was in focus.

 ?We remain hopeful that the legal issue will be settled soon,? the official said.

 Chatterjee, however, said there was no communication between the government and the company. ?We are not talking. We are only meeting in court,? he added.

 Orissa, with one-fourth of the countrys total iron ore reserves, is now the hotspot for steel mills and mining companies. The interest shown by Rio Tinto and Australian BHP Billiton is part of that trend.

 BHP Billiton has aggressive plans for Orissa and will team up with Posco for mining and support infrastructure.

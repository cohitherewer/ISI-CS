 Union Bank to tap market 

 Mumbai, May 4 (PTI): State-owned Union Bank is planning to tap the market with an equity offering and a Rs 300-crore tier-II bond issue to shore up the capital base. 

 The bank would require the fund to spruce up credit offtake as well as meet Basel II norms, said CMD Cherian Varghese. While there are no specific plans for equity offering, expanded share capital would give a headroom for raising the tier-II base through bonds, he added.

 Executive director K. Ratnakar Hegde said the government holds a 61 per cent stake in the bank. Hence, there was room to expand the capital base without the risk of diluting the Centre?s stake below 51 per cent.

 It is difficult to issue global depository receipts as foreign institutional investors? stake has already touched the 20 per cent ceiling, Hegde added.

 The bank could look at securitising part of the loan portfolio to release some capital for extending credit. 

 Meanwhile, the bank?s earnings rose marginally in 2004-05 as income from investments fell. Also, it had to make provisions for depreciation.

 Net profit increased 0.98 per cent to Rs 719.06 crore from Rs 712.05 crore in the previous fiscal. The board has proposed a final dividend of 15 per cent, taking the total dividend for 2004-05 to 35 per cent.

 Surge in global steel output

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Feb. 23: The global crude steel production has risen by 8.5 per cent in January over the corresponding period last year. In contrast, the Indian crude steel production has grown by 6.6 per cent in the same period.

 World crude steel production during January was 89.8 million tonnes compared with 82.74 million tonnes in the year-ago period.

 China posted a strong growth with a production of 25.1 million tonnes, which is 24.3 per cent higher than the year-ago period.

 Excluding China, worldwide production of crude steel grew 3.4 per cent compared with January 2004.

 India, which produced about 32 million tonnes steel last year, has clocked 3.05 million tonnes in January compared with 2.86 million tonnes in the year-ago period.

 Apart from China and India, South Korea has also performed well with a 9.1 per cent growth. 

 These three countries together made Asia the fastest growing region for crude steel production.

 Total production in Asia was 43.5 million tonnes, 15.2 per cent higher than 37.78 million tonnes last year.

 Production in the 25 European Union countries stood at 16.3 million tonnes in January, a rise of 2.3 per cent from the same month last year. Production in Italy grew by 11.5 per cent at 2.5 million tonnes. Austria produced 646,000 metric tonnes of crude steel in January, a rise of 17.3 per cent.

 Crude steel production rose by 4 per cent in Russia to reach 5.5 million tonnes. Production in the CIS countries was 9.5 million tonnes, a rise of 2.3 per cent over the year-ago period.

 In the North American region, both Mexico and the United States registered growth. Mexico produced 1.5 million tonnes of crude steel in January, up by 8.0 per cent over the same month in 2004.

 Production in the US was 8.3 million tonnes, a rise of 5.3 per cent.

 Brazil produced 2.6 million tonnes of crude steel in January, a drop of 3.2 per cent on the same month of 2004. Overall, crude steel production in South America remained static at 3.7 million tonnes. 

 The strong momentum in the industry has led to phenomenal increase in prices in all segments. 

 Consequently, the iron ore prices are set to rise sharply this year. The industry expects $100 increase per tonne from April because of a rise in input cost.

 Deal spill-over in tea merger cuppa

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 13: The tea industry was today stirred afresh with two deals in which Apeejay Surrendra snapped up the maker of the UK?s iconic Typhoo brand and Tata Tea swallowed Good Earth Corporation of the US.

 Typhoo, the bigger of the two transactions, is owned by Premier Foods, which also has the London Fruit amp; Herb and Lift brands that will now be part of Apeejay for ?80 million. 

 In the year to December 2004, tea accounted for ?70.2 million of Premier?s sales. Typhoo is the third-largest brand in the United Kingdom, where tea worth ?623 million is sold. The all-cash deal, the largest by an Indian tea company in Britain after Tata Tea?s $432- million buyout of Tetley five years back, will be closed soon.

 The Tata company did not reveal how much it paid for Good Earth Corp but market sources put the figure at Rs 100-120 crore. It is the biggest buy for the firm after Tetley.

 Good Earth, licensed to California?s FMALI Herb Inc, is one of the fastest-growing speciality tea brands with a market share of 3.7 per cent and turnover of over $16 million.

 ?Typhoo is a great brand but, after a thorough review, we believe it will benefit from the focus and investment a vertically integrated tea business like Apeejay?s can bring. Our strategy is to drive growth through the active management of our brand portfolio focusing on those brands with leading market positions,? Premier chief executive Robert Schofield said.

 Karan Paul, chairman of Apeejay Surrendra, believed Premier?s brands and labels would benefit from his group?s extensive experience in the tea business. ?We are delighted to have the Typhoo brand,? he added.

 The Tatas brought Good Earth Corporation, which sells herbal, fruit-flavoured, medicinal and traditional tea, into their fold through a pact signed by Tetley US Holdings. 

 ?We were only a marginal player in the US. This acquisition gives us a critical mass in the fast-growing speciality segment,? Tata Tea managing director Percy Siganporia said. 

 ?We believe there is real potential for growth in the US speciality tea market,? said Ken Pringle, CEO of Tetley Group and director of Tata Tea. Tata Tea shares jumped 1 per cent to Rs 822.50 on the BSE.

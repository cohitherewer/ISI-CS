 HLL divests Rossell holding

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 2: Hindustan Lever and its Anglo-Dutch parent Unilever plc have divested their holding in Rossell 

 Industries, the tea plantation company in Assam. 

 MK Shah Exports Limited, one of the leading exporters and tea plantation companies in the country, will now control Rossell (formerly Jokai Tea).

 Rossell will now cease to be a subsidiary of HLL?s Lipton India Exports.

 Rossell has suffered significant losses over the years and, therefore, the sale proceeds are nominal and of not much ?material? to HLL, the company said.

 The move comes close on the heels of HLLs plan to hive off its plantation business. 

 Hindustan Lever today informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that Unilever Overseas Holdings BV, the Netherlands-based wholly-owned subsidiary of Unilever plc, has divested Rossell?s 37 lakh shares of Rs 10 each to M K Shah Exports.

 Simultaneously, Lipton India Exports also disposed of 61.85 lakh shares of Rs 10 each.

 Unilever Overseas and Lipton India Exports together held a little over 97.5 per cent of the issued and subscribed capital of Rossell. Around 2.5 per cent is with local shareholders.

 ?The interests of the employees will be fully protected as the existing terms and conditions stay,? HLL said. 

 In November 1999, Unilever and HLL had together acquired a controlling stake in Rossell Industries. The move raised eyebrows in plantation circles as Rossell was then plagued by controversies. 

 Unilever had acquired the non-resident stake of Jokai Tea Holdings and Lipton India Exports had bought Y K Modi group?s share for Rs 173 apiece. 

 The company used to produce around 7,062 tonnes of tea. The seven gardens of Rossell are spread over 3,171 hectares in Assam. 

 An HLL spokesperson had then said the deal would give the company access to additional capacity of premium export-quality tea.

 ?We plan to increase exports of the high-quality tea from the Rossell gardens,? the official had said. 

 Rossell?s business of tea estates and brands yielded a turnover of Rs 75.79 crore at the time of the acquisition. It posted a net profit of Rs 5.81 crore in 1997-98.

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: Tech talk on trends, exhibition on emerging technologies, job mart, education fair and golf tournament ? the scale and scope of the countrys biggest information technology (IT) exposition have further broadened in its fourth edition.

 Scheduled between December 7 and 11 in the city, Infocom 2005, the annual IT show organised jointly by Businessworld, an ABP Group publication, and Nasscom, will blend business with birdies and education tips with employment tokens.

 On all counts, Infocom 2005 will be double its last years size, said D. D. Purkayastha, organising secretary of Infocom 2005, while outlining the broad contours of the annual meet ? this years theme will be IT everyday for everyone ? today at a programme organised by Nasscom. Kiran Karnik, who heads the countrys apex body of IT and IT-enabled services (ITeS) companies, was also present. 

 Infocom 2005 will be a truly international event and we are expecting over 200 delegates from countries like Germany, France, the UK, Denmark, the US, Thailand, China, the Philippines, Russia and Bangladesh, added Purkayastha.

 To get all the leading IT professionals to Calcutta during the conference, the organisers have chartered an A320 Air Deccan flight that will ferry around 180 industry leaders to the venue on December 7. 

 The organisers are hopeful that the event will draw over 1,500 delegates and the exhibition arena ? with over 250 stalls ? will attract no less than 1,50,000 visitors.

 At the conference venue, discussions will continue in three different tracks with speakers from companies like Sun Microsystems, Cisco, Oracle, Microsoft India, SAP, McKinsey, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Texas Instruments and Nortel. 

 Though all the relevant issues from the tech world will be discussed, special focus will be on ITeS and BPO.

 The organisers have also been able to rope in some biotechnology companies to broaden the scope of coverage. 

 Besides, representatives from the corporate sector, there will be peoples representatives as IT ministers of various eastern and northeastern states will take part in the deliberations. 

 We are in the process of receiving confirmations from speakers, delegates and sponsors and we are happy to see a great degree of enthusiasm with Infocom, said Purkayastha, who also referred to the upcoming information and communication technology (ICT) industry meet next month. 

 Organised jointly by Nasscom and The Telegraph with the objective of spreading the benefits of IT and telecom in the northeastern region, the two-day event at Guwahati on September 1 and 2, is modelled along the lines of Infocom and will comprise a one-day conference and two-day exhibition. 

 The idea is to provide a networking platform for key policy makers in the government, financial institutions and the IT industry in the region.

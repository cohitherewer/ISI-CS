 DRL quite Smart in research strategy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Reddy: New horizon

 Mumbai, July 1: Hyderabad-based Dr Reddys Laboratories, which has faced a series of reverses in the recent past, is adopting a new approach towards research and development. 

 The new research initiative ? labelled Smart R amp;D ? will focus on promising molecules and set aside research on large number of molecules across sundry segments. 

 The pharmaceuticals company is looking at global alliances to out-license product development as well as co-develop some items. Also, there are plans to de-risk the costs of clinical trials and product development.

 Chairman Anji Reddy told shareholders that four years ago its research focused on diabetes, anti-infectives, pain management, cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, among other things. 

 However, the company is now concentrating on metabolic disorders and obesity, along with cardiovascular and cancer.

 DRL has separated potentially winning molecules from those belonging to the also ran category. It has eliminated the latter from its R amp;D portfolio, while earmarking higher investments for the promising ones.

 Sources at DRL said the company had practised the process of elimination in the past. We only provide details of a molecule when it reaches a particular stage. These molecules did not reach that stage, the source said. 

 The official added that currently DRL is researching on RUS 3108. Phase I clinical trials of this molecule are in progress in Europe. The molecule is for cardiovascular treatment, and is considered first in its class as it uses a novel mechanism for treating atherosclerosis.

 Reddy also hinted at the possibility of forging alliances for its R amp;D efforts. The old model of global pharmaceutical organisations, in which all elements of R amp;D ? from molecular section to clinical trials ? were under a single roof, is proving to be too expensive and risky, he said.

 For instance, in March, DRL had entered into a $56-million agreement with ICICI Venture.

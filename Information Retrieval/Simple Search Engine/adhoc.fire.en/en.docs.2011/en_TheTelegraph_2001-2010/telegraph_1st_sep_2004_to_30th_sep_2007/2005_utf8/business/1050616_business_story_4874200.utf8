 Meeting on petro price hike today

 Singh amp; Aiyar: 

 Fuel for thought 

 New Delhi, June 15: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to hold a meeting with petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar and finance minister P. Chidambaram tomorrow on whether the government should bite the bullet and push through a moderate increase in petrol and diesel prices. 

 A senior petroleum ministry official said the government could go in for a moderate increase, ranging from Rs 1 to Rs 2 per litre. 

 This would be part of the delicate balancing act the government may have to perform to address the economic compulsions of saving public sector oil companies from plunging into the red and the political necessity of minimising the burden on the common man. 

 Since diesel is used to run farm machinery and public transport, the hike on this is expected to be less than that of petrol, which is still seen as a rich mans fuel. 

 The government was ready to increase the prices of the two transport fuels earlier this month but pressure from the Left forced it to postpone the decision. It remains to be seen how much resistance these parties put up this time.

 Public sector companies are demanding a hike of Rs 4.50-5 per litre in the price of the two fuels in view of the skyrocketing international prices of oil and the increase in taxes introduced in the budget presented by finance minister P. Chidambaram. 

 Some of these taxes, including the additional 50 paise cess on diesel and petrol, could even be rolled back to ease the burden on oil companies. The Left parties have also been advocating this line of action as an alternative to increasing prices. 

 According to estimates worked out by oil companies, the hike in excise duty on petrol and diesel and the increase in road cess warrant a rise of Rs 2.20 per litre for petrol and a Rs 1.06 a litre for diesel. The cost of supplying Euro III grade petrol and diesel from April 1 this year works out to 25 to 30 paise per litre. The remaining Rs 2.50 per litre will help cover the increase in crude prices.

 The Prime Minister had been holding talks with coalition partners before Aiyar left for a three-nation tour on June 4. The petroleum minister returned from Tehran today and will attend the meeting tomorrow.

 Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and IBP have informed the petroleum ministry that they are losing Rs 72 crore per day as the prices of petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene have not been increased to take into account soaring international prices. They have put their collective loss for March-April at Rs 1,424 crore.

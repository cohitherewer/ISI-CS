 New Delhi, Feb. 25: Retail investors are pouring into the stock market: on an average, 5400 new accounts are opened every weekday with the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL).

 Result: the number of accounts with NSDL swelled to roughly 6 million at the end of 2004 as investors scrambled to ride the sensex rollercoaster.

 Gross turnover on the NSE and the BSE, putting together spot and derivatives, rose to Rs 86,28,645 crore in 2004, of which Rs 5,47,449 crore or 5.8 per cent was made up by the foreign institutional investors.

 The Economic Survey shows that the NSE was the third largest bourse the Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange in terms of the number of transactions in 2004. The BSE was ranked fifth after the Shanghai bourse.

 ?A rebound in the primary market issues, particularly in initial public offerings (IPOs) of equities, was the most significant development in the securities markets of 2004,? says the survey.

 The primary capital market has boomed with the volume of issues surging five times to a level of Rs 35,859 crore in 2004. The bulk of this came from equity issues, which garnered Rs 33,475 crore ? the highest-ever level of public equity issues in India?s capital market history.

 The mean IPO size rose from Rs 31 crore in 2001 to Rs 870 crore in 2004, the survey said.

 Book-building was the most sought after route, accounting for 99 per cent of all issues in 2004.

 On the secondary market, the average trade size on the NSE and BSE spot markets in 2004 was Rs 27,715 and Rs 23,984 respectively. ?This highlights the domination of individual investors in price discovery,? says the survey.

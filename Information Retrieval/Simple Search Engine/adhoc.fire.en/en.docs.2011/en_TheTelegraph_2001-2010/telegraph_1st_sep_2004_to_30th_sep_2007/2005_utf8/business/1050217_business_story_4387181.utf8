 Calcutta, Feb. 16: Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development (Akfed), the French promoter of Development Credit Bank (DCB), is keen to increase its stake after the regulations on 74 per cent FDI in private banks are in place.

 Akfed currently holds 49 per cent in DCB. It wants to increase its stake substantially but is waiting for the regulatory framework, said Sandeep Mookerjee, head (personal financial services).

 The Mauritius-based ChrysCapital has also evinced interest to acquire nearly 13 per cent in DCB for Rs 35 crore. ?An approval from the Reserve Bank of India is still awaited,? added Mookerjee.

 If ChrysCapital joins DCB as an equity partner, Akfed can at best increase its stake by another 12 per cent.

 DCB started as a credit society in 1930. It became a co-operative bank in the eighties and a private sector bank in May 1995. 

 Apart from Akfed, a French fund ? Platinum Jubilee Investments ? holds a 6 per cent stake in the bank and 54,000 shareholders hold the remaining 45 per cent.

 ?If Akfed and ChrysCapital fail to invest because of the absence of a policy framework, other ways will be worked out to meet capital requirements. However, it is premature to talk about it,? added Mookerjee.

 The capital adequacy ratio of the bank is 14 per cent.

 The bank, which currently has a branch network of 71, plans to add 29 more in 2005-06. The ATM network will be doubled from 125 in 2005-06. 

 The bank will also securitise personal loans. ?We are starting in a small way. In the first tranche, we will securitise loans worth Rs 25 crore. We have already appointed an arranger. Crisil and Fitch are carrying out a valuation of our loans,? Mookerjee said.

 If it is successful, the bank will go for securitisation is a much bigger way.

 Retail banking is also emerging as a major area of business for DCB. At present, 25 per cent of the bank?s advances of Rs 2,400 crore goes to the retail sector.

 ?In the next fiscal, we would like to take it to 50 per cent,? he added.

 The bank currently offers personal, housing and educational loans. It also offers Cellfill, a mobile top-up service which allows any Visa card owner to get a mobile refilled at any of DCB?s ATMs. The person does not have to be a DCB customer.

 The bank, which has decided to stay away from auto-financing, is looking at opportunities to finance second-hand cars.

 DCB has a bancassurance tie-up with Birla Sun Life. ?This contributes 10 per cent of our fee-based income. We would like to increase it to 25 per cent,? Mookerjee said.

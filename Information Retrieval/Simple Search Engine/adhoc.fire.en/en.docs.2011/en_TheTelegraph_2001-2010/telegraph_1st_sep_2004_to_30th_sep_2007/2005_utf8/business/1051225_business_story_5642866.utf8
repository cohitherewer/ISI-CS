 New Delhi, Dec. 24: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today promised to bring in tax and labour reforms in the next financial year.

 The country will invest Rs 60,000 crore in ports and Rs 40,000 crore in airports, he said. A firm is being set up to build a Delhi-Calcutta and a Delhi-Mumbai rail freight corridor. Privately-run container trains will also be allowed on these routes.

 Over the last two years, we have moved towards lower tariffs, uniform tax rates and easier procedures. There are still some concerns. I promise to address these over the next few years, Singh said at the annual general meeting of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 It is not clear whether Singh was referring to demands by Ficci for restructuring income tax ceilings or to concerns that India needs to reduce industrial duties to Asean levels. 

 Singh said manufacturing is critical for a country evolving from a farm-based economy. Manufacturing is the sponge which absorbs people who need to move out of agriculture in pursuit of higher incomes ... I am concerned that the share of manufacturing in the national income has shown only a marginal improvement from 15.8 per cent in 1991 to 17 per cent in 2003, Singh said.

 The Prime Minister also promised to bring in labour reforms and fresh investments by encouraging private-public partnerships.

 If it requires modifications to our labour policies to provide greater flexibility, which, in turn, will generate more jobs, we will work with all stakeholders to generate a consensus on it, he said.

 Singh, whose government depends on the crucial support from the Left parties, added there was a need to pay attention to social safety nets because it was incumbent on the state to take care of the weak and vulnerable who cannot bear the shocks of a market economy.

 Social welfare legislation must go hand in hand with labour market flexibility. This will help increase employment opportunities while taking care of employees, he said.

 He assured industrialists that the government would work towards improving tax administration in the country so that your interface with the tax system is pleasant, smooth, problem-free and conducive to easy tax compliance.

 On demands for improving the power situation, Singh suggested that an empowered committee of chief ministers be set up.

 He said it would be desirable to initiate a speedy process in the case of power sector reforms. The VAT process, which worked well, took time to reach a consensus, he said.

 I am going to ask chief ministers to forge a similar all-party consensus in the power sector, he added.

 On VAT, Singh said he was happy that many states, which were reluctant, have joined the system. 

 On investments in railway, he said feasibility studies for dedicated freight corridors on the Delhi-Mumbai and Delhi-Calcutta route are near completion. 

 We will soon set up a firm to implement these corridors, he said.

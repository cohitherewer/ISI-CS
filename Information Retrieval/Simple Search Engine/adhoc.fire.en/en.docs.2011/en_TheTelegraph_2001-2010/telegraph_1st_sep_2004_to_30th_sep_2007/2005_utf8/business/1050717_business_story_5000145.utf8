 Mumbai, July 16: The gems and jewellery industry has trained its sights on ornaments to take on giants like Hong Kong, China and Italy. The focus in the jewellery segment comes at a time when margins on exports of cut and polished diamonds are under pressure with raw material prices rising by 20 per cent.

 In 2004-05, the industry generated $15.67 billion in export revenues. Of this, cut and polished diamonds accounted for over $11.8 billion. Jewellery exports, on the other hand, accounted for over $3.8 billion, registering a growth of 42 per cent over last fiscal.

 According to Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council chairman Bakul R. Mehta, the country can be a major jewellery supplier globally. It buys over 800 tonnes of gold annually ? the largest in the world. It is also the third-largest consumer of diamonds and excels in their cutting and polishing. 

 India produces 11 out of every 12 diamonds set in jewellery, backed by a skilled labour force. The country?s strength in IT is an added bonus. However, China is emerging as a stiff competitor, exporting over $1 billion of cut and polished diamonds last year ? a growth of 100 per cent. 

 While the percentage growth is huge considering the small base in the previous year, analysts see the country slowly emerging as a major force in the global arena.

 China has similar advantages as India on the labour front and reports show that at least 1 lakh people are involved in the diamond trade. The country is even wooing experts from India to set up base there. Moreover, De Beers, a major supplier of rough diamonds, is also looking at China to lower its dependence on India.

 China now imports rough diamonds worth around $800 million compared with India?s $7.59 billion in 2004-05, up from $7.14 billion in 2003-04.

 Mehta, while acknowledging that China could be a major force to reckon with in the long term, said the country specialises in high-end products that can be worked in a ?mechanised way?. The strength of India lies in accomplishing more complicated work and it excels at polishing diamonds, which are as tiny as one hundredth of a carat, he added. The industry is focussing on value-added jewellery as a growth of 20 per cent in this segment is forecast for this year and newer markets are also opening up.

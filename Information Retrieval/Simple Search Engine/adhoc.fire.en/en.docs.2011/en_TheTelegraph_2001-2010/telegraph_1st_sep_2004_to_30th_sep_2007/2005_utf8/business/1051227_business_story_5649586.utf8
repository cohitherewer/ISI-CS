 Gujarat Heavy Chem bags US firm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 26: Textile and chemicals manufacturer Gujarat Heavy Chemicals Ltd (GHCL) is acquiring 90 per cent in US textiles major Dan River Inc, for $17.50 million.

 This is the second major overseas acquisition by the company in recent times. GHCL had earlier bought a controlling stake in S. C. Bega Upsom S.A., a leading soda ash manufacturer in Romania, for $19.50 million in an all-cash deal through its international subsidiary.

 According to GHCL, the Dan River stake will be acquired through its overseas subsidiary and funded with the proceeds of its recently concluded foreign currency convertible bond (FCCB) issue. A part of the FCCB mop-up will also be used to refinance debts. 

 The Dan River takeover is expected to be completed by the first week of January.

 Dan River, the third largest home textile manufacturer in the US with an annual turnover of $250 million, has its outsourcing arm in the prime textile regions in Asia such as China and Pakistan. 

 In a press note, GHCL stated that Dan River has a large sales and distribution network in the US and it is also the preferred supplier to large retailers such as JC Penny and Linen amp; Things, Wal-mart, Bed, Bath amp; Beyond. Dan River also has its own brands such as Bed In a Bag, Marquis Home Collections, catering to the high-end segments.

 The domestic textile manufacturer averred that the acquisition would enable it to enter into an existing marketing arrangement of $250 million.

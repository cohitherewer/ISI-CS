 Banks on fund-raising overdrive

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 4: Banks are exploring ways to raise fresh capital beyond traditional fund-raising instruments like domestic flotations, bonds and GDR issues.

 After the issues of Punjab National Bank, Dena Bank, Syndicate Bank and Allahabad Bank, more such offers are expected over the next few months because of the robust performance of the economy and the fact that preparations for Basel II norms have to be made by March 2007. 

 These norms are mainly about allocating capital commensurate with risk. Under the new system, risks are classified into three categories ? operational, market and credit. With higher allocation, the new norms are expected to exert a pressure on capital requirements of banks, generating the need for a cash infusion.

 Union finance minister P. Chidambaram had said the banking sector may see a net depletion of 200 basis points in capital adequacy due to Basel II. This has led them to look at fresh capital.

 State-run banks like Bank of Baroda and Bank of India have announced plans to issue public offerings. The private sector is also not lagging behind. Federal Bank will issue 2 crore shares under a GDR offering.

 According to Prime Database, there are at least 12 issues from nationalised banks in the pipeline. Around seven private sector banks also plan offers. Prime said while the issue size will be determined only after price discovery through book-building, public sector banks are likely to raise at least Rs 4,500 crore. These include BoB, BoI, Union Bank of India, Central Bank of India and Corporation Bank. On the other hand, the private sector includes Bharat Overseas Bank, Federal Bank, Jammu amp; Kashmir Bank and South Indian Bank.

 Most of these banks may not face difficulties in raising funds as the government holding is much higher than 51 per cent. However, the same will be tough for banks in which the Centre?s controls just a tad over 51 per cent. 

 Moreover, in State Bank of India, where the government holding is 60 per cent, the amount it can raise through public issues has been constrained by an FII ceiling of 20 per cent. 

 Prithvi Haldea of Prime feels that SBI can find other modes to raise capital. ?FIIs are not the only source for funds. Other options include Tier II bonds, non-convertible debentures, an international offering of debt instruments or even external commercial borrowings,? he said. 

 Officials from the bank were, however, not available for comments. 

 Other banks like Dena Bank, where the government holding is slightly more than 51 per cent, are looking at raising resources by issuing innovative instruments like preference shares, guidelines of which are awaited from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

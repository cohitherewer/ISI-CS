 IDBI ready for global leap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Shetty: Bank on us

 Mumbai, Aug. 18: IDBI has drawn up an ambitious plan that envisages new businesses, a global presence and an aggressive branch expansion drive.

 IDBI now has two strategic business units, each devoted to commercial banking and development banking activities. It is likely to venture into the insurance segment and a decision is expected in the next three months, chairman V. P. Shetty told reporters after the IDBIs first annual general meeting since its transformation into a banking company. 

 Shetty said IDBI would enter life insurance first, but refused to reveal details of the plan.

 Reports suggest four international life insurance companies have approached the company seeking a tie-up. These include Axa of France, the Italian insurance group Generali, Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance Company of Japan and Fortis of Belgium.

 On the domestic front, IDBI, which now operates through a network of 132 branches, plans to ramp up this number to 500 branches by 2008. The expansion drive would be visible by the end of this fiscal itself, when the branch count touches 200.

 IDBI is also examining the possibility of having a presence in overseas markets. A team is now abroad is looking at the possibilities.

 As part of its growth strategy, the bank will focus on both corporate and retail customers, apart from fulfilling its mandated obligation of providing developmental finance. 

 We would also consider entering new businesses and geographical zones. Mutually beneficial alliances with financial players, both domestic and international, is another option, he told shareholders.

 IDBI has appointed an international consultant to develop a coherent organisational structure. Simultaneously, with a view to leveraging the performance of the merged entity, some of the common functions such as technology, audit, risk management and treasury are being carried out in an integrated manner.

 Shetty added that the bank is investing close to Rs 200 crore in frontline technologies to become a technology-driven one-stop financial supermarket. 

 The investment is expected to create a centralised data processing centre at Belapur, Navi Mumbai, with a parallel disaster recovery centre at Chennai. It would also add 200 ATMs to the existing network and take its total ATM network to over 500 by the end of this fiscal.

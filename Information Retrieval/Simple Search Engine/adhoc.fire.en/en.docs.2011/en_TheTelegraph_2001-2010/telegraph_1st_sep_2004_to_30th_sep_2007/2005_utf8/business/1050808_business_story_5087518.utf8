 Basel to spawn bank mergers

 New Delhi, Aug. 7 (PTI): Indian banking industry will see a spate of mergers and acquisitions as many of them will face problems in raising additional capital to comply with the stringent Basel-II norms, a Ficci survey said today.

 Most banks feel increased capital requirements under the Basel accord will not make them more risk averse towards credit dispensation. Instead, they may leave small and medium enterprises and the farm and rural sectors out of their credit loop.

 As the deadline of implementing the Basel II norms draws near, banks are still preparing to solve the risk puzzle for a more transparent and risk-free financial base, the Ficci survey pointed out. 

 The survey found that for smaller banks, the capital requirement would trigger a consolidation in the Indian banking system with increased mergers and acquisitions. Most banks have estimated their incremental capital requirement ? 27 per cent of the respondents said their capital requirement might increase by 1-2 per cent while 20 per cent expect it to rise by more than 3 per cent during the implementation stage of the Basel accord.

 Raising capital is not an issue with most of the banks. As many as 62 per cent of them said that they would rather prefer to raise it by a combination of tier I (equity) and tier II (debt) capital.

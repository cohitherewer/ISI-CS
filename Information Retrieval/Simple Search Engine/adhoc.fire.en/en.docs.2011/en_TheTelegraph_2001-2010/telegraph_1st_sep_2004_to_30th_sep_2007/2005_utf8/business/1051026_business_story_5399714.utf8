 Mumbai, Oct. 25: Tata Motors Ltd has reported a 9.4 per cent rise in net profit in the July-September period at Rs 338 crore compared with Rs 309 crore a year earlier.

 The companys revenues rose 15 per cent to Rs 4,781 crore.

 Tata Motors, which is the third largest seller of cars in the country after Maruti and Hyundai, plans to set up a plant for small cars with a capacity of up to 1 million units. It also plans an additional plant with a capacity of 60,000-120,000 units to make the newly launched sub-1-tonne truck, managing director Ravi Kant said.

 The company, which is considering ways to cut costs by Rs 1000 crore over the next two to three years, is studying a possible partnership with Italys Fiat for research, production, car parts, purchasing and distribution.

 Tata Motors, which controls 60 per cent of the countrys truck and bus market, said its operating margin fell to 12.05 per cent during the quarter from 12.5 per cent a year earlier, but it expected to maintain margins at 12 to 12.5 per cent for the rest of the year.

 We expect pressure from steel and fuel prices to continue, executive director (finance) Praveen Kadle said. The cost of raw materials and components rose by 20 per cent from the year-ago period.

 Indias truck and bus market is pegged at around Rs 23,500 crore and has enjoyed a 30 per cent annual growth in the past three years. It mirrors the growth in developed countries when they worked on building super highways to connect different states.

 Tata Motors sold 107,470 vehicles in the July-September period, up 12 per cent from the same period a year ago. However, rival Ashok Leyland recorded a 15 per cent year-on-year rise in bus and truck sales.

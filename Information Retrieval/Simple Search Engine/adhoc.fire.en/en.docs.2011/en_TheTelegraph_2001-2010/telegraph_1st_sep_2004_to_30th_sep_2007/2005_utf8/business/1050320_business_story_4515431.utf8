 Calcutta, March 19: Tata Motors, the second largest passenger carmaker in the country, has predicted that the industry growth may slow down to 10 per cent from the present level of 16 per cent.

 The passenger car segment, which excludes commercial vehicles like trucks, will witness volume sales of around 10.5 lakh this year.

 ?The base has grown. It is not possible to hold on to the same pace. The industry growth may just touch double digit next fiscal,? Rajiv Dube, vice-president (commercial) of Tata Motors, said here today. 

 The first quarter of the next fiscal will be difficult for the industry. The industry has already decided to jack up prices from April 1 because of a rise in input costs. 

 Tata Motors, on its part, will raise prices by 2-3 per cent across all categories. Dube, however, said the hike was not only because of the rise in input cost but also for meeting new emission norms. ?All these will lead to a rise in prices,? he added.

 The proposed VAT regime may also act as a spoilsport for carmakers. While some states have shown readiness to move to the new regime, the BJP-ruled states have decided against implementing it.

 ?Consumers in the market place do not like uncertainty. This may result in lower offtake in the first quarter of 2005-06,? he added.

 With global crude oil prices ruling firm, retail prices of petrol and diesel are likely to go up. This will also dampen the consumer sentiment.

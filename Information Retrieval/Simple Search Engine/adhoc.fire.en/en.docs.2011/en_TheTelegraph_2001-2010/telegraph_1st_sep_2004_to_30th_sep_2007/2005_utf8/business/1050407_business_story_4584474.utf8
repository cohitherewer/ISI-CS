 Airfares to Kathmandu nosedive

 Kathmandu, April 6 (PTI): International airlines have slashed the fare by more than half on the Kathmandu-Delhi route.

 After national flag carrier Royal Nepal Airlines reduced its fare by 33 per cent to Rs 1,875, a Nepalese private airline Cosmic Air slashed it to Rs 1,500 on the tickets purchased five days in advance.

 There are currently five airlines operating regular flights between the two cities. Earlier, there were only Royal Nepal and Indian Airlines, but now, Air Sahara, Jet Airways and Cosmic Air have also entered the field, leading to a price war. Earlier, the price of Kathmandu-Delhi air ticket was Rs 4,265. Jet Airways slashed the fare to Rs 3,125. Indian airlines also reduced its fare to Rs 2,812 for a Kathmandu-Delhi air ticket.

 Jet plan

 Jet Airways will make its maiden flight to Malaysia on April 29, marking growing economic ties between Kuala Lumpur and New Delhi, a senior airport official said today.

 Jet Airways will launch daily roundtrip flights from Chennai to Kuala Lumpur using its new Boeing 737-800 aircraft.

 Panel to help widen reach of PCs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Eyes wide open 

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: The government is making another attempt to increase the penetration of personal computers and Internet in the country. It has set up a working group to suggest the ways to achieve it.

 It also aims to prepare companies for the competition that will hit them when the market is opened to foreign PC manufacturers in March.

 The department of information technology has set up a working group consisting of insiders and members of the software and hardware industries to examine issues related to PC penetration, utilisation and coverage of Internet and growth of the domestic software market. 

 The department has identified thrust areas that need to be addressed during the next two to three years. The committee will offer suggestions to the government as well as the software industry.

 Sources said Dayanidhi Maran, union minister for communications and information technology, wants an accelerated PC growth.

 However, industry observers said: ?The recommendations will meet the same fate as ones before it if the finance ministry fails to give the necessary support. The National Task Force on IT and Software Development was constituted in 1998 and it came up with 108 recommendations. But unfortunately the report was not accepted.?

 Industry experts said: ?The report had categorically sought financial sops and with the ITA agreement less than two months away, it will be challenging for the group to provide a vision as the market scenario could change drastically with the entry of cheap computers from China and Taiwan.?

 The ITA agreement, which will come into effect from March, has a list of 217 items that would become zero customs duty from that day.

 The members of the working group comprises HCL Infosystems chairman Ajai Chowdhry, DIT joint secretary M. Madhavan Nair, MAIT executive director Vinnie Mehta, NIIT chairman Rajendra Pawar, VSNL director N. Srinath, Sify managing director R. Ramaraj, Wipro Infotech?s Anil Jain, DIT joint secretary Pankaj Aggarwala, and Nasscom president Kiran Karnik.

 PC penetration by March is expected to be 14 per 1000, while it was 11 per 1000 in March last year. According to MAIT, PC penetration is likely to touch 70 per 1000 by 2010.

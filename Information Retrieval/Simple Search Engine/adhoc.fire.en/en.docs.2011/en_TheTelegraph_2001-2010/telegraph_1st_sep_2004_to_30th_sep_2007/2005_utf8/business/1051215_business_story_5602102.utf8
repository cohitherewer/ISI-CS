 Florida Power courts energy firm 

 New York, Dec. 14 (Reuters): FPL Group Inc, the parent of utility Florida Power and Light, is in advanced talks to acquire Constellation Energy Group Inc for over $11 billion, the New York Times reported on Wednesday.

 Citing people briefed on the talks, the newspaper said an announcement on the deal could come as soon as this week or early next week. However, the report cautioned that it was still possible the deal could be delayed or called off.

 Several important points still need to be worked out, it said.

 The deal would be the latest in a string of multi-billion dollar acquisitions in the US utility industry over the last year. 

 Power companies have been consolidating after years of shedding assets, slashing debt and refocusing on their core operations in the wake of Enrons 2001 bankruptcy and the subsequent collapse of the energy trading market.

 A combination of the two firms would create a power company with operations all along the east coast of the US and more than 30,000 megawatts of power generation.

 It would also give FPL access to Constellations merchant energy operations, which sell power at competitive rates, and accounted for more than 80 per cent of the companys earnings in 2004. Constellation is also the parent of the Baltimore Gas amp; Electric utility.

 FPLs Florida Power and Light unit provides electricity to more than 4.2 million residential and business customers in Florida. The company also has a wholesale energy unit that was responsible for about a quarter of its 2004 earnings.

 Both companies have significant nuclear portfolios.

 FPL and Constellation were not immediately available for comment.

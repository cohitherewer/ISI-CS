The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 CSE makeover on fast track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 29: The Securities and Exchange Board of India today notified corporatisation of 10 regional stock exchanges, including those in Calcutta and Delhi. These bourses will become limited companies by shares.

 The stock exchanges in Chennai, Pune, Cochin, Madhya Pradesh, Guwahati, Uttar Pradesh, Hyderabad and Bangalore have been covered under Sebis demutualisation scheme.

 Following this, these regional bourses will have to convert or re-register (incorporate) themselves as companies limited by shares and demutualise. However, the exchanges that are already limited companies by shares, will only have to demutualise themselves.

 After corporatisation and demutualisation, there would be only one class of trading members with similar rights and privileges. This will facilitate uniform standards in terms of capital adequacy, deposits, fees while admitting any person as a trading member or for accepting his surrender.

 The notification clarified how the boards of the stock exchanges should be constituted after the corporatisation. The governing boards would be constituted in a manner that the representatives of the trading members do not exceed one-fourth of the total strength of the board.

 The voting rights of shareholders, who are also trading members, would be restricted to 5 per cent, it added. 

 The market regulator said the Calcutta Stock Exchange Association along with the nine other regional stock exchanges will be demutualised within a prescribed timeframe.

 According to the Sebi scheme, the Calcutta Stock Exchange must ensure that at least 51 per cent of its equity shares are held by public other than shareholders having trading rights.

 New tax stirs fears of drop in tea exports

 Picking holes

 Calcutta, April 24: Tea exports are likely to take a knock because of doubts over whether the 1 per cent value-added tax (VAT) paid at auctions will be refunded.

 Under VAT rules, an exporter first pays tax and then claims it against the output levy. Earlier, tea purchased at auctions was free from sales tax, VAT?s predecessor.

 ?Exporters are hesitant as they are not sure when they will get refunds. In the past, getting any refund has been a tough job. One has to run from pillar to post. This has left exporters worried,? said senior officials of the tea industry.

 Tea exports between January and December 2004 stood at 183 million kg. The industry feels taking that figure higher will become difficult if the VAT damper stays. ?It has come as a blow when we are trying to sell more in West Asia and North Africa (Wana),? the officials said. 

 The VAT drag is not limited to exports. Even domestic sales have been diluted due to the lack of uniformity in tax rates on tea in different states of the country.

 While states like Bengal, Delhi, Assam, Kerala and Karnataka are taxing tea at 4 per cent, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Orissa, Bihar and others have fixed the levy at 12.5 per cent. Added to this is the fact that several states have deferred implementation of VAT.

 ?The divergence in VAT rates has created a climate of uncertainty and confusion. This is hitting auctions, private purchases and trading,? the Indian Tea Association said. The association fears that a high VAT rate will push up tea prices and lead to a drop in consumption.

 ?Drop in consumption and a fall in demand could destabilise tea producers. This will hurt an industry already reeling under recession for the past five years,? the officials said.

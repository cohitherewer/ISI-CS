 Sony Ericsson beats forecast

 Sweet music

 Stockholm, Oct. 17 (Reuters): World number-five mobile phone maker Sony Ericsson beat forecasts for third-quarter earnings, boosted by strong demand for top-end phones such as the Walkman music-playing handset.

 The group, owned by Ericsson and Sony Corp., said on Monday it grew faster than the market during the quarter and upgraded its forecast for the wider industry. It also launched a high-speed 3G version of the Walkman phone.

 This is a very balanced all-round performance by Sony Ericsson, president Miles Flint told a conference call. We are beginning to get through a broad portfolio in the top end and the lower end.

 Pre-tax profit for the quarter was 151 million euros ($181 million), compared with an average forecast in a Reuters poll of 18 analysts of 107 million euros.

 Sales totalled 2.06 billion euros, well above a forecast of 1.73 billion euros. It sold 13.8 million units in the third quarter, exceeding expectations of 12.4 million.

 The company raised its 2005 forecast for the global market to sales of more than 760 million units from 720 million. It said strong sales of the Walkman, as well as its K750 2-megapixel camera phone, had raised the profile of its cheaper phones in a quot;halo effect quot;.

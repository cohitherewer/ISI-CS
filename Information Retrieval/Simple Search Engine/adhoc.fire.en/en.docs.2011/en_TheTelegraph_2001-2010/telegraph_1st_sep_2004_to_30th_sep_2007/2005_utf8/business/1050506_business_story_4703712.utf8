 Anil resignation poser hangs heavy on IPCL board

 Anil: Twist in timing

 Mumbai, May 5: The board of Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Limited (IPCL) had been asking Anil Ambani to reconsider his resignation even though it had accepted his request to quit as its vice-chairman.

 The double-talk, which continued alongside plans to make filings with the registrar of companies (RoC), has thrown a monkey wrench into the settlement process that has been talked about in recent weeks between the brothers.

 Documents available with The Telegraph reveal that IPCL, a company controlled by Mukesh Ambani, wrapped up the formalities of informing the registrar of companies on March 25; it actually did so three days later.

 Attention is now riveted to Form 32, which is filed with the RoC when a new director is appointed or a change is made on the board. The causes ? which could range from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification to rotation ? have to be mentioned as well.

 In this case, IPCL wrote that Anil had ?resigned as vice-chairman and director? in the sixth column of the form. He himself was not informed, nor were exchanges or shareholders, that his request to leave had been accepted.

 Going by the sequence of events, the change was brought to the public domain, and to Anil himself, only when reports revealed that his name was missing from the list of directors posted on the IPCL website on April 22.

 IPCL wrote to exchanges on April 23, saying the resignation had been accepted on January 20. The company tried to salvage matters by declaring that its board had requested Anil to continue. However, his spokesperson denies having received any letter to that effect.

 Indian Petrochemicals Corporation was acquired by Reliance three years ago when the government sold it as part of its divestment programme. The company has been doing fairly well under Mukesh, riding the petrochemicals cycle to its advantage.

 It is the events after Anil?s resignation that have now come into sharp focus. On January 20, when the IPCL board met, all directors, chairman Mukesh and his close associate Anand Jain, asked Anil to stay on. 

 Ironically, it was Jain who Anil blamed for driving a wedge between the Ambani brothers, and for his resignation.

 On January 21, IPCL followed up the board?s request by formally writing to Anil to reconsider. A week later, Anil sent a reply indicating he was ready for a rethink, and sought the view and guidance of the company board.

 By the third week of February, the 30 days allowed for filing Form 32 with the registrar of companies passed. Why it was eventually done on March 28 is not known. But it is apparent that Anil?s resignation was accepted on January 20 even as pleas to reconsider it went out.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Tata?s auto financing shifts gears 

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, April 22: With the merger of Tata Finance and Tata Motors being put in place, the vehicle financing division of the automobile major is looking at a new chapter in its business.

 Apart from moving ahead in the value chain by venturing into untapped areas like refurbishing, refinancing and reinsurance, the company will also focus on the passenger vehicle segment.

 So far, it was present only in vehicle financing and maintenance segments. 

 ?A large part of the value chain was left out in the earlier arrangement. We will now get into these categories,? Tata Motors executive director (finance) Praveen Kadle told The Telegraph.

 Moreover, the company was focused on financing the commercial vehicle (CV) segment.

 Now that the sales of passenger vehicles (PV) have almost equalled that of CVs, the new division, Tata Motor Finance (TMF), will stress on the PV segment as well.

 So far, Tata Finance and the Bureau of Hire Purchase and Credits (BHPC), the internal financing arm of TML, could finance 18 per cent of all Tata vehicles sold.

 Kadle said the company has set a target to finance 40 per cent of all Tata vehicles sold in the next five years.

 Till the time the TMF division attains this volume, the company will only finance its own vehicles.

 The move by Tata Motors is seen as a move to de-risk its business model.

 This is the first step to build a strong captive financing unit on similar lines as those of most international players.

 Globally, vehicle financing contributes about 20-44 per cent to the bottomline of auto majors like General Motors and Toyota. 

 In case of Tata Motors, it is below 10 per cent.

 ?Historically it is seen that the core business has suffered losses but the financing arm recorded profit to give respectability to the balancesheet,? Kadle said.

 The company sold about 4 lakh vehicles last year with CV and PV contributing equally.

 BHPC and Tata Finance sanctioned and disbursed about Rs 3,300 crore for vehicle financing last year.

 Since Tata Motors? balancesheet was much stronger than that of Tata Finance, the cost of business was not competitive enough to challenge banks, which are major players in the financing market. The merged entity will now be able to match the offers of other established players in the market.

 The merger between two companies will be effected from April 1, 2005 following the approval of shareholders and courts. A swap ratio of 8:100 has been fixed for Tata Finance shareholders.

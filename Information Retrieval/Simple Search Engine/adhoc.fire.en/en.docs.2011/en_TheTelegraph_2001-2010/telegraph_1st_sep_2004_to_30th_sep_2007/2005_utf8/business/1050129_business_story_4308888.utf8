 Calcutta, Jan. 28: Usha Martin Limited has signed a memorandum of understanding with JCT Limited to acquire the latter?s steel wire and wire rope division at Hoshiarpur in Punjab for Rs 21 crore. The deal is part of the company?s strategy to grow through acquisition in the next 18 months.

 The company is currently carrying out the due diligence of the JCT facility and expects to bring it in its fold by March 31. The unit produces 30,000 tonnes of steel wire and ropes.

 Usha Martin joint managing director P. Bhattacharya said, ?In the next 18 months, we will go in for another acquisition ? this time in the US. The company will focus on growth through acquisitions and capital expenditure to enhance the steel wire and wire rope manufacturing capacity.?

 The company plans to hike capacity from 140,000 tonnes per annum to 210,000 tonnes per annum through a mix of acquisition and existing capacity building.

 The company is also going in for backward integration by entering into iron ore and coal mining. It is also increasing its steel producing capacity at Jamshedpur from 280,000 tonnes to 320,000 tonnes. ?This will be further jacked up to 500,000 tonnes,? Usha Martin managing director Rajeev Jhawar said.

 The company has posted a net profit of Rs 9.02 crore in the quarter ended December 31 against Rs 2.93 crore in the previous year ? a growth of 207 per cent.

 The net sales for the nine-month period stood at Rs 870.72 crore compared with Rs 557.51 crore in the corresponding period last year, registering a growth of over 56 per cent.

 Profit before tax rose to Rs 41.05 crore from Rs 15.22 crore and net profit to Rs 25.80 crore from Rs 10.45 crore.

 ?Our domestic business is expected to achieve Rs 1,250 crore turnover in the current fiscal. Exports will also cross the Rs 400-crore mark against Rs 200 crore in the previous fiscal,? Jhawar added.

 Under the debt restructuring exercise taken up in the last financial year, an additional high-cost debt of Rs 30 crore has been restructured through a prepayment premium of Rs 2.75 crore. 

 This has been charged off in the third-quarter figures.

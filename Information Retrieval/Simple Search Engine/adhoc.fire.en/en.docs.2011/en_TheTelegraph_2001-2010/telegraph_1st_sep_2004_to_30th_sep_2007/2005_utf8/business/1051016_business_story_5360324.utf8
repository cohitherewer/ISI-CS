 Publicis not to bid for Aegis 

 ERIC PFANNER

 London, Oct 15: The Publicis Groupe, a marketing services company based in Paris, said on Friday that it had decided against bidding for the Aegis Group, an advertising company in London that has drawn the interest of several rivals. 

 In addition, the WPP Group, based in London, confirmed that it was in talks with a private equity firm about making a joint bid for Aegis, which buys space and time for advertisers. A third party, the French investor Vincent Bollore, continued to buy shares in Aegis, bringing his stake to 15.43 per cent. 

 Publicis, which approached Aegis this summer to discuss a possible bid, said on Friday that it had decided to suspend its interest for now, though it did not rule out a bid at a later date. 

 Publicis has decided that it is not in the best interests of shareholders to make an offer, the company said. It, however, reserved the right to do so if another party announced a firm intention to make an offer for Aegis or if the Aegis board agreed to an offer. 

 WPPs announcement that it was exploring the feasibility of a cash offer for Aegis was the first public pronouncement from that company of its interest. Though the equity firm was not named, people close to the talks have previously said that it was Hellman amp; Friedman of San Francisco. 

 WPP confirmed that its primary interest was in Aegis market research unit, Synovate, but a purchase of all of Aegis would probably encounter regulatory resistance because WPP is the worlds largest media buyer, and the Carat division of Aegis is a leading rival in that business.

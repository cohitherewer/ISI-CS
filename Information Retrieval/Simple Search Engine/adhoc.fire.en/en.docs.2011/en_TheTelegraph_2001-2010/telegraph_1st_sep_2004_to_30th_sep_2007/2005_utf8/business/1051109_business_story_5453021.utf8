 Calcutta, Nov. 8: Union Bank of India will go ahead with its second public offer and will not opt for the preference share route even if the finance ministry announces it before the banks second flotation.

 The bank has filed an application with the government for issuing 4.5 crore shares to raise capital. Post-issue, government holding in the bank will come down from 60.85 per cent to 55.45 per cent. The issue will be through the book-building route and will hit the market within this fiscal.

 Banks, which have little headroom for raising capital, is waiting for new instruments that will enable them to increase the tier-I capital. Issuance of preference shares is one of them, which will also take care of the governments stake in the public sector bank. The governments stake in the bank cannot be brought down below 51 per cent. Preference shareholders do not enjoy voting rights, said K. Cherian Varghese, chairman of Union Bank.

 Varghese is expecting an announcement on this issue from the finance ministry soon. However, even if the instrument becomes available before our second float, we will not shelve our plans to go to the market, he added.

 The issue is aimed at shoring up capital adequacy ratio in view of the robust growth in credit and to meet the Basel?II requirements. Post-issue, the capital adequacy ratio of the bank will be 11.5 per cent.

 Replying to queries on consolidation of the banking sector in India, Varghese said the finance minister has set the ball rolling. 

 But all stakeholders of the banking sector like political parties, unions and bank managements have to arrive at a consensus for consolidation to take place. It will take time,he added.

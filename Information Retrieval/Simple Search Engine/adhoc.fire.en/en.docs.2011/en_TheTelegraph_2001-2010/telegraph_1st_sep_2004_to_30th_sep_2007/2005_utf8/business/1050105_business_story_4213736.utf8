 Wipro zooms in on Noida centre

 Noida, Jan. 4 (PTI): Wipro is looking for an additional 100-acre plot of land in Noida for setting up a facility.

 ?Wipro has already bought a 40-acre plot of land in Greater Noida and is looking for an additional 100 acres. We will give them as much land as they want,? chairman of UP Development Council, Amar Singh, said. 

 Shiv Nadar-promoted HCL Technologies, which is headquartered in Noida, is also planning to expand its operations in Uttar Pradesh.

 ?HCL has identified a 40-acre plot of land on the Delhi-Agra Express Highway and it will be allotted to the company soon,? Singh said.

 Wipro?s presence in Uttar Pradesh was a reflection of the soundness of the state?s IT policy, which has been formulated by Infosys managing director Nandan Nilekani, IIT director Sanjay Dhande and Xansa chairman Saurabh Srivastava, he said.

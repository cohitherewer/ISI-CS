 Microsoft rushes to calm Europe anti-trust nerves 

 Fingers crossed

 Brussels, June 1 (Reuters): Anti-trust authorities are sifting through Microsoft Corporations final proposal to comply with a European Commission decision, which the software giant submitted near a midnight deadline, a commission spokesman said on Wednesday.

 If the proposals fall short, Microsoft will face a fine of up to $5 million daily, which could be imposed before August.

 Contacts continued between the European Commission and Microsoft until late last night, and the commission will now carefully analyse whats on the table, commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said. 

 He said the commission will assess whether or not we consider that Microsoft has complied with the March 2004 decision.

 Said a Microsoft spokesman: We can confirm that the proposals did go into the commission last night prior to the deadline and we await its response.

 The commission, which polices competition in the 25-nation European Union, fined the US software giant a record 497 million euros ($654.9 million) on March 24, 2004, which it has paid.

 But it had dragged its feet on other penalties, which were supposed to take effect in the spring and summer of 2004.

 First, Microsoft took the commission to court in an attempt to delay these penalties ? known as remedies ? until a broader challenge to the decision was settled in 2006 or later.

 When a judge turned that down in December, Microsoft was not ready to submit versions of the remedy acceptable to the commission, which is the judge of their adequacy.

 It kept talking, until competition commissioner Neelie Kroes finally drew a line.

 Under the imposed remedies, Microsoft must make its ubiquitous Windows operating system available without Windows Media Player, so computer makers can buy alternative software to play films and music from RealNetworks and Apple.

 And the company must share information with rival makers of servers used to run printers and retrieve files, an issue known as interoperability. The company must also propose an acceptable trustee to monitor compliance.

 The commission has said that it will take weeks to analyse Microsofts latest attempt.

 If Microsoft fails to comply, the commission will bring a new formal action for its failure and issue a formal statement of objections. Microsoft would have two weeks to reply and then the commission would impose a fine. 

 That fine could be up to 5 per cent of its daily turnover worldwide, which is about $5 million, and would begin once the commission acts. It is unlikely the fine would be suspended should Microsoft decide to appeal, a spokesman for the commission has said.

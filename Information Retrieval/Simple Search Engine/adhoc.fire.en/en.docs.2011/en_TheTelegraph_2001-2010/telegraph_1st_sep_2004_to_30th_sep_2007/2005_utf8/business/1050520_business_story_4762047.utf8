 Calcutta, May 19: Texport Electronics Limited plans to set up an airconditioner manufacturing unit at the Falta export zone by next year. This will primarily serve as a sourcing base for its export plans.

 The company, a 50:50 joint venture between Swiss firm Sangam and Texport, has launched the AVI brand of airconditioners in February.

 Texport managing director Raj Sahai said, We plan to export to West Asia, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Maldives. 

 Currently, the companys products are sourced from the Chinese unit. 

 With a manufacturing base in India, it will be easier to serve the export market. We have already acquired the space and expect to start work in the next few months, he added. The company has set a target of Rs 50-crore turnover for the first year of operations.

 Texport has launched its portable AVI airconditioners in the 0.65-tonne and 1-tonne categories priced at Rs 17,900 and Rs 19,900 respectively. 

 The ACs are available in window, split and standing models.

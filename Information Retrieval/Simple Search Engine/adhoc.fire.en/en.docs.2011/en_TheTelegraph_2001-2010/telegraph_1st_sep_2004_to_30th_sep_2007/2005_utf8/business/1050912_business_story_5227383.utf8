 Scramble to bag captive coal mines

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: Steel,cement and power companies are in the race for 20 coal blocks and 11 lignite mines being put up for captive mining by the coal ministry.

 The Tata group wants four mines for its planned steel plants at Kalingapur in Orissa, a new unit in Jharkhand and for expansion at its existing Jamshedpur facility. It is also eyeing a non-coking coal mine for a power plant in Orissa.

 Ispat has set sights on 5-6 coal blocks in Orissa and Jharkhand to expand its Maharashtra works from 3 million tonnes (mt) to 5 mt. It is also planning a plant in Jharkhand to make pellets. 

 Steel Authority of India (SAIL) is studying the offer from the coal ministry and will take a stand later. However, the steel giants top brass said it was looking more closely at the possibility of buying stakes in high-grade foreign coal mines.

 The Jindals and Essar are also in the race. Sources said the new round of allocations would be only forplayers who either have projects in hand or are putting up plants. Reliance Power will also seek around seven non-coking coal mines for its units. 

 This is, perhaps, the last time allocations will be done for coal blocks. After this, the government will revert to a new system of open bidding for user industries.

 The government wants to amend the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act 1973, which will allow it to auction coal blocks not exploited by Coal India or its subsidiaries, to steel, cement and power firms through competitive bids.

 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, March 22: Twenty-three year old Uma Nair is highly enthusiastic about her association with Google in Hyderabad. 

 She is among the hundreds who are working out of the swanky office of Google at hitech city in Hyderabad, churning out reams of content for the world?s largest search engine, which boasts of 8 billion pages of information on its website.

 The operations of Google in Hyderabad have grown rapidly into one of the company?s six major centres. It operates from a five-storeyed complex built over three acres.

 Google Inc chief financial officer George Reyes said dozens of employees, who work in the centre, will represent the next generation of talent engaged in content engineering.

 Google Hyderabad, the company?s second centre in India, will conduct engineering, human resources, and online sales and services functions for its customers the world over. 

 The company will continue its task of organising global information in a universally accessible and useful way at its Hyderabad centre, said Reyes.

 He said Google chose Hyderabad because of its large, well-educated, technology-literate and English-speaking population, besides its competitive environment and sound infrastructure.

 Reyes said the content warehouse of Google was available in 114 interface languages, including five belonging to India in 117 countries. 

 Google India head of sales and operations Roy Gilbert said while the Bangalore centre focused on engineering R amp;D, that in Hyderabad concentrated in servicing of its AdWords advertisers and AdSense publishers throughout the world. ?Google Hyderabad will focus on bringing products like gmail and other links for the exhaustive storehouse of content to India.?

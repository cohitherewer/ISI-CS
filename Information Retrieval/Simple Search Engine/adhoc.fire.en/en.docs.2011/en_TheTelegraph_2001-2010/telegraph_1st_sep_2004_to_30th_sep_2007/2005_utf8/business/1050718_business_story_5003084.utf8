The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Schuster stares at criminal suit over VW project fraud

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Schuster: The noose tightens

 Hyderabad, July 17: The Andhra Pradesh government is considering registering a criminal case under Section 420 of the IPC against Helmuth Schuster, the ousted Volkswagen executive alleged to have swindled Rs 11 crore meant for the German firms Vizag project.

 The state government is waiting for clearance from the Union home ministry, which can ask the CBI to probe the matter only after a case is lodged against Schuster. 

 The state today released half-page advertisements in all Telugu newspapers to drive home the message that Schuster was the root cause of the controversy over the project. The media rebuttal is also meant to take the edge of the Oppositions smear campaign. Today, senior BJP leader Bandaru Dattatreya said B. Satyanarayana, the industry minister who steered the Volkswagen deal, should be punished with a sacking, not merely shifted to a new job.

 On Saturday, chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy said Schuster had deceived the government by pressurising us to deposit two million euros as part-payment of our stake in Vashisht Wahan, the dubious outfit at the centre of a storm because of its identity.

 However, it appears that the state government was informed about the benami nature of Vashist by Volkswagen officials immediately after the visit of a state government delegation to Germany in May, when reports of Schusters shady deals surfaced. 

 Officials at Andhra Pradesh industrial investment corp, which put in the money on behalf of the government, blamed Satyanarayana and his special officer, Raghavendra Rao, for rushing through with the infusion. However, the chief minister spiked objections from the law and finance ministries and offered a free hand to Satyanarayana to ensure AP got the project by hook or crook. 

 Meanwhile, the visit of a state government delegation to Germany has been delayed because visas have not come through and some officials are still abroad on other assignments. Volkswagen, which wanted them there by July 13, has not renewed its invitation.

 Calcutta, Aug. 31: Linc Pen amp; Plastics Ltd is eyeing a turnover of Rs 300 crore in the next two years. At present, the company?s turnover is around Rs 120 crore.

 Managing director Deepak Jalan today said Linc was planning to set up a factory at Jangalpur near Calcutta. A final decision on this would be taken in a month?s time.

 Outlining the company?s strategy at the 11th annual general meeting, Jalan said, ?we will focus on the Rs 10 segment. So far we have been focusing on the Rs 5 segment only.?

 Last year the company?s business grew by 46 per cent. This year, Linc hopes its business will grow by 39 per cent. However, the company?s profit grew only by 20 per cent because of the rise in polymer prices. 

 ?We did not pass on the entire extra burden to consumers,? he said.

 The company is also going to set up two more exclusive retail outlets ? one in Mumbai and the other in Kanpur.

 Linc?s exports stood at Rs 10 crore last year which is expected to reach Rs 20 crore this year.

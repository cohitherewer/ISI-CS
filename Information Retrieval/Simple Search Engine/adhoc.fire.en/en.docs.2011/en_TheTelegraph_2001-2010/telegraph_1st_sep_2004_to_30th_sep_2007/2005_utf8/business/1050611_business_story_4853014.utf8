 Calcutta, June 10: Reliance Infocomm plans to expand its Internet data centre business to three more cities by the end of next year. Currently, the company has four centres ? two each in Mumbai and Bangalore.

 We have already acquired land in Calcutta, Chennai and Hyderabad. Work on all the three data centres will start around September this year and will be completed within 10-12 months. 

 The centres will be operational by 2006-end. Another data centre will also be set up in Delhi, said Sanjay Mashruwala, president, Reliance Infocomm.

 The telecom major has already earmarked a total investment of Rs 1200 crore for the expansion, Rs 200-300 crore for each centre that will be spread over approximately 1 lakh sq ft.

 Our ongoing centres are already nearing capacity and we need to set up new centres to keep pace with the growth in business, added Mashruwala. Besides, about 30-40 per cent of the capacity has to be kept aside for internal use.

 All the data centres will be connected through the high-speed optic fibre IP network of the company which have points of presence in more than 700 cities. 

 Each the data centre is further connected to 52 countries including the US, the UK, West Asia and Asia Pacific countries through the Flag Telecom backbone.

 The Internet data centres offer various managed solutions for banks, financial institutions, e-commerce companies, content providers and public portals. 

 The business mainly has two components, co-location and retail, explains Mashruwala. 

 For the co-location business, we have to create the demand in segments like banks, financial institutions and corporate enterprises. The challenge is to partner with the government, which has a huge amount of fragmented data. Also, the state governments are reluctant to part with its information, he added.

 For retail users, the major usage services are e-mail, file storage and data transfer. 

 The company expects to rope in the small and medium business sectors such as auto component manufacturers and online lottery companies.

 Reliance Internet data centres also provide offer value-added services like server management, database administration, security, disaster recovery and data back-up.

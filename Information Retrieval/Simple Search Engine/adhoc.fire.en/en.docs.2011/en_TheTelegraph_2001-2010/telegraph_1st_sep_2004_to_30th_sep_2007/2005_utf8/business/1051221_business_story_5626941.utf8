 Reliance gas deal in court

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 20: The National Thermal Power Corporation today filed a suit in Bombay High Court to enforce a gas supply deal with Reliance Industries.

 NTPC is understood to have sought an order asking RIL to execute the contract in its original form. The move comes days after the corporation informed the Centre about its intention to take legal recourse to stop what it called deviation sought by RIL in the gas supply purchase agreement. 

 In its suit, NTPC said the court should ask Reliance not to sell, commit or offer gas to any other customer. The Mukesh Ambani-controlled company was the winner of a 2004 bid the power major had floated for supply of gas at $2.97 per mbtu from 2007 to its Kawas and Gandhar projects, adding up to around 2600 mw.

 In its letter earlier this month, NTPC wanted the power ministry to take up the matter with the ministry of petroleum to ensure that Reliance signs the gas agreement at the earliest. This would also require developing its gas fields and pipelines on the original schedule. 

 The power ministry is understood to have expressed its inability to intervene in a commercial contract between two companies, unless there was a violation of production sharing contract between the government and RIL.

 Power minister P. M. Sayeed ? who died days back ? had said the changes sought by RIL in the gas contract would have an adverse commercial impact on NTPC.

 NTPC will take legal steps for enforcing the contract. The power ministry has written to the petroleum and natural gas ministry for initiating administrative measures to enforce the contract, Sayeed had said earlier this month.

 The deviations that Reliance sought concerned the limitation of liability, gas supply obligation, besides development and production plans. RIL, for instance, wanted a dilution in the provision which requires it to pay for the alternative fuel in case of supply disruptions.

 RIL has been arguing that damages in case of non-supply should be brought down to 175 per cent of the annual contract value, instead of the previously agreed 300 per cent. It also wanted an upward revision in price, saying it has to pay operators of Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields more for the gas, though it owns 30 per cent of the two assets.

 Magic Air poses stake riddle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 27: The civil aviation ministry will go to the cabinet to seek clarifications on whether persons of Indian origin can hold a majority stake in domestic airlines.

 The move comes on the back of comments by the department of economic affairs on a proposal to allow a new airline, Magic Air, which is 60 per cent owned by a British citizen of Indian descent.

 The department has pointed out that only the cabinet can change the existing policy, which allows foreigners to own up to 49 per cent stake in an airline. All Indians, including those who hold local passports and are settled abroad, can purchase up to 100 per cent stake.

 The aviation ministry wants to know if the facility of treating persons of Indian origin (PIO) on a par with non-resident Indians in some areas will be extended to airlines.

 However, as aviation is considered a sensitive sector, the DEA wants to play safe and wants the cabinet to have the final say on the issue. It does not want to passing its own judgement, give that the existing aviation policy forbids majority control for foreign investors. 

 The issue of foreign control of airlines has come up repeatedly before the cabinet with several ministries, including the home ministry, strongly pitching against the move. Three governments ? those of the United Front, NDA and the current Congress-led UPA ? have favoured foreign investment below 50 per cent. Ironically, through this time, the finance ministry had been backing majority stake ownership by foreign investors. 

 If the cabinet were to change its decision at this juncture, it would mark a major departure from the earlier policy. A strong lobbying war has already broken out over the proposal with several existing airlines against the move, civil aviation ministry sources said.

 Magic Air is being launched by Neera Radia, a British entrepreneur of Indian origin who runs a Delhi-based public relations agency called Vaishnavi. She is known to be close to the Tata group. 

 Radia had earlier floated a firm called Crown Express, which leased out aircraft on behalf of US principals to Indians. She had also worked closely with Singapore Airlines when it was trying to enter the aviation sector in collaboration with the Tatas in the late 1990s.

 Magic plans to start with three Airbus 320s but is likely to expand its fleet to 10 planes by the end of the first year. Radia, who has met several Bengal MPs as part of a public relations exercise, has promised them that she would base at least two of the 10 aircraft at Calcutta and use the eastern city as a hub for her airline. 

 In December last year, maverick business tycoon Richard Bransons desire to buy a stake in an Indian carrier dimmed after civil aviation minister Praful Patel ruled out investments in his personal capacity on the grounds that he already owns a foreign airline. 

 Our policy is very clear on not allowing parties with even an indirect link with any airline to invest, he said, adding that Branson was the chairman of Virgin Atlantic.

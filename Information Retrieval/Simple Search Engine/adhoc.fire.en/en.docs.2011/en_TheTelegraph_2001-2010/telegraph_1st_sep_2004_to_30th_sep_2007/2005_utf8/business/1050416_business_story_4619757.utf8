 GE profit up 25% in first quarter

 Boston, April 15 (Reuters): General Electric Co on Friday said first-quarter profit rose 25 per cent and lifted the low end of its full-year earnings forecast, citing increased jet and rail engine demand, a buoyant market for diagnostic equipment and strong results at NBC Universal.

 The conglomerate reported net income of $4 billion, or 38 cents a share, up from $3.2 billion, or 32 cents a share, a year earlier.

 Analysts on average forecast earnings of 37 cents a share.

 GE, which because of its wide range of businesses is considered a bellwether for the US economy, is benefiting from improving global manufacturing demand, a rebounding commercial aviation market and successful health-care and media acquisitions.

 Nine of GE?s 11 business units increased profit by more than 10 per cent in the quarter, and the company got a boost from the sale of Genworth Financial Inc shares in a secondary offering.

 Revenue rose 19 per cent to $39.8 billion, compared with Wall Street?s consensus estimate of $37.96 billion.

 For the full-year, GE lifted the low end of its earnings forecast range by 2 cents.

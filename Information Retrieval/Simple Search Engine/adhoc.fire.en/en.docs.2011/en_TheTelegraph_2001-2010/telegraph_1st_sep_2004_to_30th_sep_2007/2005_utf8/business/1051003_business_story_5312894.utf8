The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Banks asked to up targets

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Oct. 2: Almost half-a-dozen public sector banks, including heavyweights like State Bank of India (SBI) and Punjab National Bank (PNB), have been asked by the Union finance ministry to rework their annual targets for the current financial year.

 The move comes in the wake of the finance minister P. Chidambaram recently expressing unhappiness over some of the banks projecting lower targets compared with the previous fiscal. He had said it was difficult to comprehend the lower projections at a time when the economy was growing at 7 per cent. 

 A senior finance ministry official told The Telegraph, We are concerned at the lower projections by public sector banks. About six or seven banks have been asked to review their targets. These include big banks such as SBI and PNB and smaller ones like Uco Bank. 

 All 27 public sector banks recently submitted their statement of intent on annual goals to the finance ministry. The statement of intent on annual goals are submitted by the banks to the finance ministry based on their growth indication in a particular financial year.

 The finance ministry official added that the banks projected lower targets for growth of deposits, advances and reduction of non-performing assets (NPAs). The official conceded that the banks might have their rationale for the projections, but that did not match the finance ministrys expectations. 

 However, he said the central government want them to set stiff targets. The banks might have their reasons for such numbers. But the finance ministry would like them to set higher targets. With the economy booming, the banking sector in India should also grow in a robust manner, the official added. 

 The finance ministry recently asked the state-owned banks for their annual statement of intent on financial targets. The system, that is all set to become an annual practice for banks, replaces the earlier proposal for a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between them and the finance ministry.

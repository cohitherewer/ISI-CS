 Cablevision owners hit the private trail

 New York, June 20 (Reuters): The Dolan family that controls Cablevision Systems Corp said on Monday it offered to take the US cable operator private in a $7.9-billion deal that would also spin off its cable networks and sports team businesses.

 Cablevision shareholders would get $21 a share in cash plus shares in Rainbow Media, which includes American Movie Classics, Independent Film Channel, Womens Entertainment channel as well as five regional sports networks, the New York Knicks basketball team, the New York Rangers hockey, among other assets, according to a press release.

 Assuming a value of $12.50 a share for the Rainbow Media assets, the company said the total value of the offer was $33.50 a share, which represents almost a 25 per cent premium over Fridays closing price and 6 per cent premium over its 52-week high.

 Shares rose 24 per cent in premarket trading to $33.30, just shy of the premium offered by the Dolans, from Fridays New York Stock Exchange close of $26.87.

 The offer comes amid concerns over the growth prospects for cable companies, some of which are losing subscribers to satellite television companies such as DirecTV Group Inc and EchoStar Communications Corp. At the same time phone companies are investing billions of dollars into their lines to offer competing video service.

 Charles Dolan is Cablevisions chairman, while his son James is the chief executive officer. If the deal is accepted, Charles is expected to be chairman of privately-held Cablevision, while James would be chairman and chief executive of Rainbow Media.

 We strongly believe that a long-term, entrepreneurial management perspective ? not constrained by the public markets tendency to focus on short-term results ? will better enable the cable company to meet its competitive challenges, the Dolan family said.

 Cablevision would become the third major cable company to take itself private after Cox Communications and Insight Communications.

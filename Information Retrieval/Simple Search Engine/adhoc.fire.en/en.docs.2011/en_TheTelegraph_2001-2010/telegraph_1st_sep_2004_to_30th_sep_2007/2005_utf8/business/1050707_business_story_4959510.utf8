 Orissa bid to kickstart stalled projects

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, July 6: The Orissa government has pulled up a couple of steel companies for not starting work on the ground though the MoU had been signed months ago.

 Though the state government was very enthusiastic in signing up companies for setting up of steel and other mineral-based plants in the state, many proposed projects have not yet taken off. 

 Taking an exception to this fact, the government yesterday issued a terse warning that the MoUs signed with the companies concerned would be cancelled if they did not pursue the projects. The government has so far signed as many as 37 MoUs with several private companies, including Posco, Tata Steel, Sterlite and Jindal.

 A high-level review undertaken by steel and mines minister Padmanav Behera found that four out of 17 proposed steel plants for which the MoUs were signed in 2003-05 did not take off at all. The promoters of these projects include Deo Mines amp; Minerals, Konark Ispat Limited, MSP Metalix Limited and Monnet Ispat Limited. 

 Deo Mines amp; Minerals had signed an MoU in October 2003 for setting up a 37,500 tonnes per annum plant, while MSP Metalix agreed to start a 28000 tonne per annum mineral project. Monnet Ispat had signed an understanding in November 2004 for setting up a 25000-tonne-per-annum steel plant and Konark Ispat had signed for a steel plant in May.

 The review revealed that the Chhattisgarh-based Monnet Ispat had not shown any interest in starting its Dhenkanal project, while the Deo Mines amp; Minerals and Konark Ispat had not deposited money with the state government for land acquisition.

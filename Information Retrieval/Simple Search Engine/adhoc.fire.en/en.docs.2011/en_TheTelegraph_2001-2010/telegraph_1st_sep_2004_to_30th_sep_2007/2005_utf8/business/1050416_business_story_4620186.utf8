 Rabobank sows seeds of equity fund 

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Bhasin: Sniffing opportunities

 Calcutta, April 15: Rabobank will launch a private equity fund for the food and agricultural sector within June this year. The corpus of the fund will be $50 million (or Rs 220 crore). 

 ?Rabobank has decided to launch a private equity fund. The board has already approved the proposal. We are waiting for the necessary legal and administrative clearances,? Sanjiv Bhasin, chief executive officer and managing director of Rabo India Finance (RIF), told The Telegraph.

 A major chunk of this fund will be deployed in the Indian market. Bhasin said the Rabo group sees good opportunities in this sector across the supply chain from farm to shelf. With the new government placing a lot of emphasis on the development and growth of the agriculture sector, Rabo feels the private equity fund can be gainfully deployed in this country. 

 Rabobank provides comprehensive strategic advisory services, corporate banking and corporate finance products for the food and agricultural sector. Rabo India Finance, a 100 per cent subsidiary of Rabobank of the Netherlands, is advising a leading global player in fresh produce on its strategy for entering India. However, Bhasin refused to name the company.

 Rabo India Finance is also weighing options to offer trade and commodity finance products for the food and agriculture sectors. ?Weather derivative is one area which we are seriously looking into. We are preparing a database on it,? Bhasin said.

 Weather derivative is an instrument used by companies to hedge against the risk of weather-related losses. The investor who sells a weather derivative accepts the risk by charging the buyer a premium. If nothing happens, then the investor makes a profit. However, if the weather turns bad, then the company claims the money.

 Rabo India is also keen to enter into the biotechnology sector in a big way. It is in talks with the Uttaranchal government for setting up a biotechnology park in the state.

 Bhasin added they are speaking to a lot of states about the biotechnology park. 

 ?Bengal is keen to develop this sector and we are willing to work with the government,? Bhasin said.

 The bank had registered a net profit of Rs 29.4 crore for the financial year ended March 31, 2004. 

 Rabo India may register a lower profit in 2004-05 compared with the previous year. ?Our profit may be marginally lower as we have made a higher provisioning to clean up our balance sheet. Our net non-performing asset is less than 1 per cent,? Bhasin said.

 Rabo India has kept a target of 40 per cent overall growth in 2005-06.

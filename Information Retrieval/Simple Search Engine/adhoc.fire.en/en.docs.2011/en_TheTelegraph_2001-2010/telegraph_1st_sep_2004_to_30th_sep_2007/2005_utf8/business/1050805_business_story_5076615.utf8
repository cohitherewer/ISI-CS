 Brokerage fee system set for an overhaul

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 4: A committee appointed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has suggested that brokers pay around 1 per cent of the prevalent brokerage rates.

 If the recommendations of the committee are accepted, brokers in cash equity, cash debt and derivative segments will pay fees at the rate of Rs 100 (against Rs 1000), Rs 5 (Rs 100) and Rs 50 (Rs 10) respectively per Rs 1 crore of turnover (value of transactions put through or reported by the broker to any of the exchanges).

 According to the present fee structure, a stock broker has to pay Rs 5000 each fiscal for an annual turnover not exceeding Rs 1 crore. Where the turnover is in excess of Rs 1 crore, he has to pay Rs 5000 plus one hundredth of 1 per cent of the turnover. 

 After five financial years from the date of initial registration, the present structure requires a broker to pay Rs 5000 for another five, starting from the sixth fiscal, to keep the registration in force.

 The Anjaria committee said since its recommended rate in the derivative segment is substantially higher than the current level of Rs 10 per Rs 1 crore of turnover, the market regulator may consider the upward revision of fees in a phased manner. It can increase the fees from Rs 10 for a Rs 1-crore turnover to Rs 20 in the first instance. Over a period of time, it may be increased to Rs 50.

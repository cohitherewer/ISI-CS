 Calcutta, Sept. 7: Multi-Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) is keen to tie up with its counterparts in Europe and the US.

 We already have alliances with the Baltic Exchange in London and the Tokyo Commodity Exchange in Japan. We are eyeing more such tie-ups in the Europe and the US as a natural progression, said Jignesh Shah, managing director, MCX. He was speaking on the sidelines of a session organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce.

 It is very logical to have such knowledge sharing arrangements in these countries as the commodity market in India is continually opening up, he explained. The exchange has entered into a joint venture to set up Dubai Gold amp; Commodity Exchange in Dubai.

 MCX has an exclusive tie-up with United Planters Association of Southern India (Upasi) and will launch tea futures by December this year, mentioned Shah.

 We shall also launch the entire range financial derivative products involving non-ferrous metals including aluminium, zinc and nickel by the end of this fiscal, added Shah.

 The exchange will also open physical delivery centres in Calcutta and Chennai. Currently, such centres of MCX are located at Ahmedabad, Delhi and Mumbai. Initially the new centres will deliver weekly gold contracts and over the time other commodities will also be added, said Shah.

 He informed that the Forward Market Commission (FMC) would submit its recommendations to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs within the week on allowing banks, mutual funds and foreign financial institutions to trade on commodity exchanges.

 The committee set up by FMC had representation from the Reserve Bank of India, Securities and Exchange Board of India and the commodity exchanges of the country.

 Allowing banks, mutual funds and other financial institutions will provide further impetus to the commodity market, which has grown manifold in the last two years, said Shah. He added, Trading in options will also be allowed shortly on the commodity exchange and the recommendation is lying in the Parliament. 

 However, he noted that the introduction of options is not possible unless certain amendments were made in the Forward Contract Regulation Act.

 Currently 60 commodities are being traded on MCX, of which 10 are actively traded and accounts for the largest volumes. 

 As we develop, more commodities will be introduced and each commodity exchange will have around 100 actively traded commodities, Shah said.

 Three couples given Infocomm privileges

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 27: Three mysterious Delhi couples have joined the list of those who were accorded the privilege of becoming Reliance Infocomm shareholders for a song.

 Whether they are well-heeled politicians or merely owners of obscure firms that received the bounty is not known. Though their names do not have a ring of importance, they must be special people to have acquired coveted shares of the telecom major at Re 1 apiece.

 Anand and Anita Sharma, shown as proprietors of Fairever Traders and Consultants, got 34 lakh shares through their firm. Amit and Kamini Gupta were given 33 lakh shares through Softnet Traders and Consultants P. Ltd. Lalit and Sapna Goyal of Prerna Auto P. Ltd are also sitting pretty with 33 lakh shares, received in much the same way.

 The one crore shares that these add up to were allotted on September 16, 2002 ? 60 days after Dhirubhai Ambani passed away and only two months before the December 28 launch of Reliance Infocomm services.

 It was believed that Infocomm was owned 45 per cent by Reliance Industries (RIL), 45 per cent by the Ambani family and 10 per cent by employee trusts. However, recent revelations show a slide in RIL?s stake to 42.36 per cent ? apparently at the expense its 30 lakh investors.

 The one crore shares with the couples account for 0.25 per cent of Infocomm?s Rs 416.35-crore capital. These are worth Rs 150 crore, based on a Merrill Lynch valuation of $13.7 billion (Rs 60,000 crore) for the telecom firm.

 On Tuesday, details of three crore Infocomm shares with Manoj Modi and his wife, acquired through Kaizen Commercial, came to light. Today?s disclosures could reinforce the notion that RIL paid much more than other investors in buying the same set of shares at Rs 250 each. This included Rs 249 as premium in deals where the average price of each share has been put at Rs 26.

 Tied to the post

 Reliance IndiaMobile (RIM) prepaid recharge vouchers will be sold across the counter at post offices under an arrangement the firm has forged with the government-owned agency. S. P. Shukla, president of Infocomm?s wireless products and services, said the marketing tieup will initially be limited to Andhra Pradesh.

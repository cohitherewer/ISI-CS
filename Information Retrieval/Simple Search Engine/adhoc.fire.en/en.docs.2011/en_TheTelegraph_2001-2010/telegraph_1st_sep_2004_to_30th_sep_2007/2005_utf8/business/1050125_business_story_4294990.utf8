 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 24: Larsen amp; Toubro Ltd (L amp;T) has posted a 30 per cent rise in net profit for the third quarter ended December 31 at Rs 132.35 crore.

 The company recorded gross sales and service revenues of Rs 3,268 crore, reflecting a 32 per cent rise. For the nine-month period, net profit at Rs 296.85 crore showed a growth of 20 per cent, while gross sales at Rs 8,960 crore gained 44 per cent.

 These profit figures, however, exclude a one-time gain of Rs 353.32 crore accrued on sale of shares of Ultra Tech Cement in the previous quarter.

 L amp;T said the engineering and construction segment reported order booking of Rs 3,161 crore for the quarter, which is in line with the management expectations. The total order booking for nine months aggregated to Rs 7,853 crore. The company expects to book a significant volume of orders in the current quarter, which is expected to help in achieving a reasonable growth in order booking for the year.

ESL net jumps

 Essar Shipping Ltd (ESL) has registered a 191 per cent jump in net profit for the quarter ended December 31 to Rs 107.24 crore from Rs 36.84 crore in the corresponding period last year.

 The company recorded an increase in its operating revenues to Rs 196.77 crore for the quarter compared with Rs 147.86 crore for the previous year, an increase of 33 per cent. The tanker freight rates saw their all-time peaks during the last quarter of 2004. 

 The main driver behind the strong market conditions was growth in Chinese oil consumption, increased crude prices, increased crude production by OPEC and shutdown of the nuclear power plants in Japan.

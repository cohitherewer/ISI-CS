 Usha Martin inks deal for wire unit

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 21: Usha Martin and Joh Pengg AG, an Austrian company, will set up a speciality wire manufacturing plant in India.

 The Austrian company will hold a 60 per cent stake in the joint venture, while Usha Martin will own the rest.

 P. Bhattacharya, joint managing director of Usha Martin, said initially the venture will have an annual capacity of 3,000 million tonnes. It will later be scaled up to 10,000 million tonnes.

 The plant is likely to come up in Ranchi, where Ushas existing plant is located.

 Industry sources said the initial investment would be in the region of $5-7 million.

 Bhattacharya said once the business plan was formalised by the new company, it would take about a year to set up the plant.

 The product, aimed at the auto industry, is a niche item. Worldwide production is about 140,000 million tonnes.

 The deal between the two companies was finalised during the visit of Alexander Phillipp, managing director of Joh Pengg, to India.

 Initially, we will service the local industry. Later we will go to neighbouring countries, Bhattacharya added.

 Joh Pengg is an established Austrian producer and worldwide exporter of oil-tempered round and shaped wire for automative and various other applications.

 The deal with the Austrian company comes close on the heels of its acquisition of a JCT facility in Punjab. Usha Martin will acquire JCTs steel-wire and wire-rope division at Hoshiarpur.

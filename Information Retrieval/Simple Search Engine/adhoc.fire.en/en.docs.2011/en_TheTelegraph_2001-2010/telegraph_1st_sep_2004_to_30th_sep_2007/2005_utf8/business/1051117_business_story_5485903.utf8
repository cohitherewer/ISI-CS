 Calcutta, Nov. 16: LG Electronics India Limited (LGEIL) plans to raise its GSM phone manufacturing capacity by adding nine more assembly lines to the existing single line.

 The Korean major has set a sales target of 1.5 million GSM units next year with the number of models going up from 12 to 23. 

 LGEIL deputy managing director Moon Shin said, GSM handsets will be a major growth driver for us. We plan to increase the handset manufacturing capacity at our Pune plant to around 20 million units by 2010.

 The plant currently has a capacity of one million units.

 We plan to invest Rs 200 crore in manufacturing. This is part of the Rs 900-crore investment outlined till 2010, he added.

 The company also plans to manufacture optical storage devices like CD-ROMS at the Pune plant. This will, however, cater to the export demand from European markets.

 Exports currently account for 7 per cent of the companys turnover, but is expected to go up to 30 per cent in the next five years.

 Only 10 per cent of the market requirement is sourced from our overseas manufacturing units. The bulk 90 per cent is manufactured at our Noida and Pune plants, said Shin. We are not looking at any greenfield projects at the moment but will choose between Chennai and Bangalore when we decide to expand.

 LG will also expand its AC manufacturing capacity by 300,000 units with the assembly line at Pune expected to be operational in the next 12 months. Currently, the Noida unit churns out 500,000 units annually.

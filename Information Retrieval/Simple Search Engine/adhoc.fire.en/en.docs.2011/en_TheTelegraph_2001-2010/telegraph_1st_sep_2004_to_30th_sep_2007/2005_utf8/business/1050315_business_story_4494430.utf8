 MphasiS finds its Eldorado in US

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Rao: Buy mode

 Mumbai, March 14: The MphasiS BFL group will acquire Eldorado Computing Inc, a US-based healthcare benefits management firm, for $16.5 million in an all-cash deal.

 The deal also allows a performance- based incentive for Eldorados top management over the next three years. The move will strengthen MphasiS?s footprint in the US and help it enter the healthcare insurance and payment market in that country. 

 The transaction is likely to be completed in the quarter ending March 31.

 Eldorado Computing Inc has revenues of over $10 million. It specialises in claims processing and benefit management solutions for the health insurance industry. 

 Its customers include third party administrators, insurance companies, self-funded employers, associations and unions, among others. With 128 clients representing 2.5 million members, the company is a major player in technology administration solutions for healthcare players.

 Briefing newspersons here today, MphasiS chairman Jerry Rao said the acquisition forms part of the companys strategy to strengthen its hold in the US. The deal is expected to be a perfect fit for MphasiS as it provides a well-established software platform and marquis healthcare customer basis. 

 ?The acquisition will position MphasiS as a first mover in integrating a global sourcing back-end to a platform-based software offering,? he added.

 Ruling out the possibility of any more acquisitions in the near future, Rao said while MphasiS has been a mid-cap company, it has been ?still ahead of the curve?. He pointed out that it is committed in pursuing two key verticals which includes financial and technology apart from business process outsourcing (BPO).

 ?In BPO, where we are clearly not sub-scale, we are considered big,? he observed, adding that the basic need is to own and operate the platform.

 Officials of MphasiS here added that as the healthcare industry in the US is growing faster than its GDP growth, the demographics of that country reveal a huge opportunity.

 According to Zane Bell, CEO, Eldorado Computing, ?By utilising MphasiS?s global delivery capabilities, we will be able to offer our services to a broader range of customers in the US and will be in a better position to service their needs as a leading IT platform as well as BPO services company.?

 Calcutta, March 8: The service tax commissionerate of Calcutta expects to garner revenue worth Rs 800 crore for the current fiscal, around 10 per cent lower than the projected figure of Rs 900 crore.

 Kamal Jyoti, commissioner of service tax, Calcutta, said, ?We had set a stiff growth target of almost 100 per cent for the year so that we could achieve at least 80 per cent.? In 2003-04, the commissionerate had collected a revenue of Rs 446 crore.

 Jyoti said till the end of February, the department has collected Rs 630 crore and expects to collect another Rs 170 crore by March-end. 

 The jurisdiction of the service tax commissionerate of Calcutta excludes Bolpur, Siliguri and some parts of Haldia. 

 For the next fiscal, the target would be to achieve a growth rate of 25 per cent, which means a collection of Rs 1,000 crore.

 The government has set a service tax revenue target of Rs 17,600 crore for 2005-06, a growth of almost 25 per cent from the current year?s revised estimate figure of Rs 14,150 crore. 

 Till January, the countrywide collection figure was Rs 9,752 crore against Rs 5,972 crore during the same period last fiscal.

 Jyoti said there are only six independent service tax commissionerates, namely Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Bangalore. The rest falls under the jurisdiction of the Central Service Tax Commissioner.

 Based on the number of assessees, Calcutta stands third after Mumbai and Delhi. He mentioned that till the middle of February, there were 19,500 assesses registered under the jurisdiction of Calcutta.

 ?This fiscal, we had launched registration drives and added more than 8,000 assessees. 

 Currently, there are another 20,000 identified but unregistered members. However, with the new threshold limit of Rs 4 lakh annual income, 15,500 assessees will go out of the registration net. Thus, we have scope to register around 4,000 more assessees,? said Jyoti. 

 In the next fiscal, the commissionerate plans to register 50 per cent more assessees than those registered in the current year. 

 ?We will put emphasis on the electronic survey method other than the recent street-to-street method, whereby we will inspect the list of members of various organisations like the chambers, professional associations and marketing organisations,? Jyoti said.

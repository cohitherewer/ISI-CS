 Goldman eyes China bank

 Hong Kong, July 9 (Reuters): Goldman Sachs is eyeing a substantial equity investment in Chinas largest lender, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), a local newspaper reported on Saturday.

 The US company, which teamed up with German financial firm Allianz AG, has started talks to acquire stakes in ICBC, the South China Morning Post said, citing sources.

 A Goldman spokeswoman declined comment on the report.

 The size of any potential stake purchase was unclear, but the paper said it could be a multi-billion dollar investment.

 The paper also cited an unidentified source as saying that Goldmans top management had been granted preliminary approval for the investment.

 Other players in talks with ICBC include American Express Fortis and Credit Suisse.

 Earlier this month, the China Securities Journal said Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB) was likely to become the first foreign investor in ICBC after the Chinese bank sets up a listing vehicle this year. ICBCs chairman said earlier the bank was talking to foreign investors to sell a 10 per cent stake by the year-end to pave the way for an initial public offering in 2006 or 2007.

 ICBC, one of Chinas Big Four banks, won a $15-billion cash bail-out in April to help clean up its balance sheet and allow it to follow rival state-backed lenders Bank of China and China Construction Bank as they prepared IPOs.

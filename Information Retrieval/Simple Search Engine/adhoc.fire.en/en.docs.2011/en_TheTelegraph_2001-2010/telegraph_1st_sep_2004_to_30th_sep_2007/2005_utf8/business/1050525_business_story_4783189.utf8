 Bengal close to Haldia deal with Purnendu

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, May 24: The Bengal government is all set to transfer its shares in Haldia Petrochemicals to TCG chief Purnendu Chatterjee.

 The agreement will be signed between the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC), the outfit through which the state has invested in HPL, and TCG on May 27.

 HPL board members will meet on May 28 to clear the sale. The board will also discuss the issue of HPL joining Basell Polyolefins as a minority shareholder through an investment of Rs 2,500 crore.

 The government has decided to give Purnendu two months? time after the agreement is signed to bring in the funds to physically buy out the shares.

 Writers? Buildings sources said the government has already sought lenders? approval for the share transfer. 

 The lenders have approved HPL?s investment in the Dutch petrochem giant Basell Polyolefins. The TCG-led consortium has bought out the Dutch firm for $5.7 billion.

 Signing the share transfer agreement means Indian Oil will not get the 7.5 per cent stake in HPL for which it has put in Rs 150 crore. ?Purnendu will have to take a decision on IOC?s entry,? sources said.

 IOC had put Rs 150 crore in the company on February 18. The cheque is yet to be encashed by HPL.

 Once Purnendu, one of the principal promoters, buys out the government?s share, he will be in a position to make HPL invest in Basell. The government, as a majority shareholder in HPL, is not keen on HPL investing in Basell.

 Writers? Buildings sources said the TCG chief is willing to fork out Rs 1,560 crore to buy out state?s share in the petrochemicals firm. Purnendu now has a 43 per cent stake. 

 Sources said the Bengal government has quoted nearly Rs 30 per share ? a premium of Rs 20 on a share of Rs 10. 

 However, industry circles feel that raising funds for both Basell and HPL will not be a problem for Purnendu. ?US investors are keen to invest in India. Petrochemicals is a lucrative area as the industry is on an upcycle. The positive trend will continue till 2008,? analysts said.

 Besides buying out the Bengal government?s stake in HPL, the company is also trying to refinance its existing loans and reduce the average interest load by another 1 per cent from 10.5 per cent to 9.5 per cent. Before going in for a debt recast, the company was paying an interest of 16 per cent.

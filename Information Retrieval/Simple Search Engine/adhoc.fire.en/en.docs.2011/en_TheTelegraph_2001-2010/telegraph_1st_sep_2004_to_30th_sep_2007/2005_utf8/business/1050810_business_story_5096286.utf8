 Tea buyout stirrings

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 9: Tata Tea plans to make its second overseas acquisition in the next six months either in Latin America or the US. 

 The company is setting up a war chest for acquisition ? both at home and abroad. To begin with, it has increased the investment limit by Rs 500 crore.

 We are looking at acquisitions at home and abroad, which can be carried out by Tetley as well as Tata Tea, group chairman Ratan Tata told the shareholders at the annual general meeting of Tata Tea.

 The Tatas are looking at companies as well as brands. The buyout may be in the beverages, ready-to-drink or speciality tea categories.

 Tata Tea vice-chairman R.K. Krishna Kumar said, It takes at least $1 billion to make a global acquisition. We had acquired Tetley through a mix of debt and equity. But now we can raise foreign currency loans at a much cheaper rate.

 Apart from acquisitions, Tata Tea is also planning to enter South Africa in a big way. The company has launched the Tetley brands in South Africa and is planning to launch the Tata Tea brands. 

 Tata Motors has launched trucks and cars in South Africa. The South African government has granted permission to VSNL to become the second network operator in the country. Tisco is setting up a ferro-chrome unit there. Therefore, South Africa is becoming an important investment destination for us, said Tata.

 The chairman said the company is aiming to establish a global brand in tea, which will be marketed from India. Tetley is already a global brand in our kitty, he said.

 The company had already restructured South Indian plantation operations by transferring 16 estates of Munnar to Kanan Devi Hills Plantations Company.

 Krishna Kumar said for North Indian estates, the company was working with an external agency looking at ways to improve the quality of life and income of workers. 

 The shareholders have approved an enabling resolution to raise foreign institutional investor (FII) investment limit to 35 per cent of the paid-up share capital of the company.

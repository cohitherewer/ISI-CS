 Split AC: Chill sets in on price-cut plan

 GARIMA SINGH

New Delhi, Feb. 28: Summer is round the corner ? but airconditioner makers are divided over whether they will pass on the benefit of the excise duty cuts to consumers.

 Industry says that prices may not come down, at least in the next 3-4 months.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram had reduced excise duty on air-conditioners from 24 per cent to 16 per cent. Consumers may have been led to believe that this would translate into a cut in prices, but industry is split on the issue.

 Says Rajeev Karwal, chief executive officer of Electrolux Kelvinator: quot;There will be no great impact on the prices of air conditioners. This is because approximately 95 per cent of ACs are being manufactured in the zero duty excise areas like in the states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Jammu and Kashmir and Chattisgarh.?.

 According to him, only price tags of high end ACs which are imported will come down by 2-3 per cent.

 However. Salil Kapoor, head-marketing from LG Electronics India Limited, says, ?It is a welcome gesture as it will lend scalability to non-exempted manufacturers. It will give them impetus and thus prices are expected to come down slightly after 3-4 months quot;.

 The industry, however, unanimously welcomed the reduction of peak rate of customs duty from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. The finance minister also announced a reduction in customs duties on basic metals, plastics and inputs from 15 per cent to 10 per cent.

 Durability factor 

While acknowledging the governments initiative 

to offset the anomaly of inverted duty structure arising due to implementation 

of free trade agreement (FTA), the industry says a lot needs to be done in this 

direction. 

 At present, the customs duty on colour television, colour picture tubes, refrigerator and air conditioner on import from Thailand is 12.5 per cent. This will come down to 6.25 per cent this year and 0 per cent in year 2006.

 However, many of the inputs attract the peak rate customs duty of 15 per cent. This will not encourage entrepreneurs to manufacture and invest in India.

 quot;The issue needs to be addressed urgently as it affects the survival of the industry, quot; said R.P Khaitan, president of the Consumer Electronics and TV Manufacturers Association (CETMA).

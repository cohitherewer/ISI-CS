 Patents rejig bill hits rough patch

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 16: The proposed patents (amendment) bill ran into more rough weather today with BJP leaders L. K. Advani, Arun Jaitley and Jaswant Singh meeting commerce minister Kamal Nath and asking him to refer the bill to a parliamentary committee. 

 Interestingly, BJP parliamenatry party spokesman V. K. Malhotra admitted that the Vajpayee government had drafted the bill but insisted that in its current form, it was ?against national interest?. The bill does not adequately safeguard the interest of the country?s farming and pharmaceutical sectors, he added.

 The BJP leadership now says referring the bill to a standing committee or a select committee of Parliament is the only way to take into account views of all sections, including industry and NGOs. They also said in view of the country?s international commitment and the need for an urgent solution, the party MPs would be ready to work during the recess to resolve the issue in a time-bound manner.

 The Left parties have also expressed strong concern over the issue and have urged the government to use ?flexibility? provided in the TRIPS agreement to prevent the domestic companies from being adversely affected. It is also feared that the cost of essential life-saving drugs could shoot up if sufficient care was not exercised.

 Nath has stated the government would hold talks with both the Left and the BJP and he expected to introduce the bill in Parliament soon.

 The government had given an assurance that all views and concerns will be taken into consideration suitably before finalising the Patent (Amendment) Bill, 2004.

 The government has already issued an ordinance in order to meet the country?s obligation under the TRIPS agreement of the World Trade Organisation to amend the Patents Act, 1970 to provide for patent protection in all fields of technology with effect from January 1, 2005. The domestic companies have pointed out that the current provision in the law is not adequate to prevent this ?evergreening? of patents, which delays Indian companies from producing generic drugs on the genuine expiry of the patent. 

 The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance had in a special representation to finance minister P. Chidambaram sought safeguards in the patents (amendment) bill to shield domestic companies from the onslaught of multinational pharmaceutical companies who misuse the patents regime. The bill is expected to be introduced in the winter session of Parliament.

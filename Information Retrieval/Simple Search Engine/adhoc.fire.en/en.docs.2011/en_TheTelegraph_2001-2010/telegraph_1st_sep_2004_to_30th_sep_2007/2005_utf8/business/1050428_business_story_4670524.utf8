 Calcutta, April 27: Hindustan Newsprint Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hindustan Paper Corporation, will explore the initial public offering route to finance part of its expansion plans.

 ?We will take a decision on the matter in the current financial year and the public offer will be around Rs 300 crore,? Hindustan Paper chairman and managing director Raji Philip said.

 Global consultant firm Jaakopoyry has been commissioned by the government to submit a detailed project report to double the installed capacity and product portfolio change in Hindustan Newsprint. The consultant will submit the report within the next fortnight and the project will be complete by 2008, said Philip.

 ?The consultant has also been commissioned to conduct a study on the global competitiveness of the domestic paper industry,? Philip said.

 The total estimated investment in the project is Rs 640 crore and will be financed through a mix of capital raised through public offer, external borrowings and internal accruals.

 ?After the public offer, a majority stake will remain with the state-owned Hindustan Paper and therefore, with the government,? clarified Philip.

 A two-phased programme with a capital investment of Rs 520 crore has also been lined up for modernisation and technological upgradation of the two units of Hindustan Paper Corporation ? Nagao Paper Mill and Cachar Paper Mill.

 The first phase of the project will require an investment of Rs 298 crore and will be completed in 2007, while the second phase will be over in 2009 and need an investment of Rs 222 crore. In 2004-05, the group has achieved a turnover of Rs 854.08 crore, a decrease of 3 per cent from the previous year?s figure of Rs 876.91 crore.

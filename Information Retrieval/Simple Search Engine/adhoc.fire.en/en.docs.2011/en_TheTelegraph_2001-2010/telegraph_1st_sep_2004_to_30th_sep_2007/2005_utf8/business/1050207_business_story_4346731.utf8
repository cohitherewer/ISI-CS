 VISA steel project in Orissa set to take off

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Duburi (Orissa), Feb. 6: VISA Industries will start hot-metal production at its Kalinganagar Industrial complex here once its blast furnace is up and running in March.

 The 1.5-million tonne integrated steel project will initially produce 2.25 lakh tonnes of pig-iron every year. Coke ovens, ferro chrome furnaces, DRI kilns, a 40 MW power plant and a steel melting shop are part of the Rs 1600-crore venture that will make 4.5 lakh tonnes of pig-iron later.

 The first phase will see a modern coke oven plant with an annual output target of 4 lakh tonnes come up at a cost of Rs 400 crore ? generated mostly from internal resources and loans raised at a debt-equity ratio of 65:35.

 Managing director Vishal Agarwal said all links in the project will be in place by 2010. ?Our aim is to finish the project before that deadline. The plant size will be similar to SAIL?s Durgapur unit,? said Agarwal, who is counting on robust steel demand to keep his project going.

 The Calcutta-based VISA signed a pact with the Orissa government in December 2003 but work on the project could not start until May last year due to delays in land acquisition. It has 390 acres now but needs another 800 acres.

 The firm has sought mining leases in Joda-Barbil areas of Keonjhar district. Until that comes through, it will buy the 7 million tonnes of iron ore it needs to produce 4 lakh tonnes of steel from Orissa Mining Company. 

 By 2010, when all parts of the project go on stream, the company will have a head-count of 5000. Several industrial houses had evinced interest in steel projects at the Kalinganagar industrial complex over the past year, but VISA?s is the first major plan on the verge of a take-off.

 The state government has decided to form a special purpose vehicle with private sector participation for developing the infrastructure in the region.

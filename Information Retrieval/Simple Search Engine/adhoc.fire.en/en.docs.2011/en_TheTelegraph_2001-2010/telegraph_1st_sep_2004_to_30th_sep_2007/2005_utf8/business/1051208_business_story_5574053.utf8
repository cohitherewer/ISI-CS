The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Both tango, to different beats

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Murthy: Here we go

 New Delhi, Dec. 7: Both are software tsars. They lead the entourage of the richest. Neither misses a chance at charity. Yet Bill Gates and N.R. Narayana Murthy straddle two ends of a world where their differences are the stuff of entrepreneurial lore and hoary leadership fables.

 The men who some say have even dwarfed their companies in stature wear their philanthropist labels with aplomb and distinction; they rarely skip an opportunity to contribute to a cause they hold close to their hearts. 

 Both steer clear of politics ? in fact Murthy quit as the head of a body steering the construction of a new Bangalore airport after a former PM questioned his role. 

 For much of their lives, they have spent sleepless nights trying to maintain the quality of products and services; both software writers are voracious readers, too.

 However, the two often take different routes when it comes to dealing withissues like retaining people in their organisations or in their policies on stock options. On larger questions of war and outsourcing, Gates and Murthy are rarely on the same plane.

 The Microsoft chief, for instance, supported the action in Iraq. He points out that the US intervention in the Second World War was also criticised, but then the international community saw the benefits of democracy.

 Ideally, Murthy would nudge his company into introspection when there is a problem ? rather than justifying or opposing it. He urges Indian firms to understand why there is resistance to outsourcing. 

 I would resolve it rather than react. I dont have a problem in making my point. I will be forthright, unlike Gates who is nice even on the most controversial of questions, said Murthy in a discussion organised by The Indus Entrepreneurs. 

 If there is dissent, the issues have to be examined and sorted out. In the long term, it will pay, he added.

 Gates said he rarely worries about his wealth. My concern is whether we missed out on development of a product that others have, he said. He is unflappable when it comes to competitors like Google and Novel. We are happy that they are underestimating us, Gates said. 

 Murthy, by contrast, is riveted to core issues such as scalability. It is about missing out on scalability, innovation and productivity, and yes retaining the best talent. 

 The Microsoft founder said he saw his life in two parts ? the first to earn money and second to give it back to society. Murthy echoed his sentiment, saying philanthropy was important for a country like India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Steel policy almost cast in iron

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 20: The National Steel Policy, which will be unveiled in a month, has already been sent to the cabinet for approval, steel ministry joint secretary J. P. Singh said.

 The government started working on the policy in 2004 and a draft was formulated. The policy envisages a 110-million-tonne steel-making capacity in the country by 2020.

 The policy will be published at a time when China is coming out with its own. China, which accounts for one-fourth of worlds steel production, is trying to reorganise its fragmented industry and create a long-term sustainable environment.

 The world will be keenly watching the policies from India and China ? two key steel markets with high growth potential.

 At present, the Indian capacity is pegged at 36 million tonnes (mt), while China has crossed the 300-mt production mark this year.

 Even though about 7 per cent growth is projected for India backed by a strong economy, undulating price has remained an issue. To curb the wild price swings, the government is likely to promote futures trading in steel.

 Singh said the government would like to see commodity exchanges play a role in trading to help buyers hedge. We are going to be a facilitator. We are not going to set up any exchange, he said on the sidelines of the annual general meeting of Steel Re-Rolling Mills Association of India.

 Investments worth Rs 2,30,000 crore will be required to step up the steel output to the projected level of 110 mt. Around 10 lakh direct and indirect jobs will be generated, he said. 

 According to estimates, one man year of employment in the steel industry generates an additional 3.5 man years of employment elsewhere in the economy because it is linked with other sectors such as transport, mining, construction, machinery and steel fabrication.

 Singh also said the government was considering ways to streamline the grant of new mining lease.

 A policy has been framed to address the issue. The move was necessitated following refusal of iron ore-rich states to allow their raw materials to be used outside their borders.

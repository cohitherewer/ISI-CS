 Signal of foreign funding burst

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 14: Foreign investors are making a beeline for India as an investment destination. Opening up of sectors, upbeat market conditions and investor-friendly policies are some of the factors luring them to the country.

 An annual survey by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) on foreign direct investment (FDI) in India shows that more than 70 per cent multinational companies operating here have recorded profits and 84 per cent have given a positive assessment about the country.

 Last year, only 40 per cent of the respondents were positive about the countrys socio-economic-political parameters. 

 Expressing satisfaction with operational parameters, 91 per cent of the respondents said they foresee huge investments in their own sectors. 

 A whopping 90 per cent of them have rated India as an attractive place for the skilled IT and BPO workforce.

 However, the study points out that the lack of infrastructure facilities, coupled with inflexible labour laws, incidence of indirect taxes and multiplicity of procedures in starting up operations, are holding down Indias attractiveness as a manufacturing base or an export hub.

 CII-Ascon survey

 The domestic manufacturing sector has steadily grown during the April-June period this fiscal with as many as 29 sectors, including petrol, construction, textile machinery and tourism, posting an excellent growth, according to a survey jointly carried out by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and Ascon.

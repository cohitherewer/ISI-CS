 Temasek to stock up more

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 29: Singapores two biggest investment outfits ? Temasek and Government of Singapore Investment Corporation ? will soon be on the prowl to enlarge their holdings in Indian companies after the special dispensation that is being given to them under the comprehensive economic cooperation agreement (CECA).

 Under the agreement, India is relaxing the fetters by allowing Singapore to invest up to 20 per cent in any Indian company. 

 The two Singaporean based FIIs have a sizeable exposure in leading private sector banks like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, ING Vysya Bank and even public sector banks like Corporation Bank.

 The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation holds 3.68 per cent in ICICI Bank, while the FII stake is 43.64 per cent. 

 This will give the two Singaporean government-owned entities the freedom to raise their shareholding in banks like ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Corporation Bank.

 Temasek, a Singapore government-owned institutional investor with a penchant for investing in banks based in Asia, is expected to chip in with big funds.

 Temasek is the largest shareholder in South Koreas Hana Bank, with a 9.99 per cent stake. In Singapore, Temasek controls DBS Bank.

 Temasek also controls 25 per cent of Pakistans NDLC IFIC Bank. In its foray into China banking last year, it took a 4.55 per cent stake in Minsheng Banking Corp, Chinas first privately-owned bank. It is also bidding for a 5.1 per cent stake in Chinas largest bank, the China Construction Bank, with an investment of $1.4 billion.

 Temasek has identified regional banking markets ?with their emerging middle-classes and fast-growing economies ? as a promising investment sector. Temaseks investment strategy is simple, according to analysts. Banks are often seen as a proxy to the economy of every country, they say.

 The comprehensive economic cooperation agreement will take effect on August 1, and will also give Singaporean banks greater freedom to operate in Asias fourth largest economy. 

 Already, commerce minister Kamal Nath has estimated that investments to the tune of at least $7 billion could flow into the country in the first year of the accord. 

 Singapore controls vast amounts of dollar reserves and has been an aggressive investor in foreign lands as they reach saturation levels for investing locally.

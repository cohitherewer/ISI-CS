The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Bonds of Rs 15000 cr to heal oil burns

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 8: Downstream oil companies are likely to get bonds of around Rs 15,000 crore during the winter session of Parliament, which begins in the last week of this month. While a little over half this amount will go to Indian Oil Corporation, the rest will be shared more or less equally between Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum.

 A senior official told The Telegraph that the differences with the finance ministry on the exact estimate of the bonds had been narrowed down in the final proposal to be submitted in Parliament. 

 While the decision to issue oil bonds had been taken on September 6, it could not be implemented as the appropriation of the amount from the consolidated fund of India requires the approval of Parliament. Withdrawal of such amounts can be done only through supplementary demands for grants, which have to be tabled in Parliament.

 The government announced on September 6 that bonds would be issued to downstream oil marketing companies Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and IBP to compensate for not raising domestic cooking gas and kerosene prices despite skyrocketing global crude prices.

 The oil companies will be losing a little over Rs 15,000 crore on LPG and kerosene sales during the remaining financial year and this sum is expected to be covered by the bonds to be issued by the finance ministry in consultation with the RBI. 

 The bonds will be in the form of IOU notes from the government, which the oil companies can encash with the banks or financial institutions at a discount. The rate of interest and maturity period of the bonds has to be worked out.

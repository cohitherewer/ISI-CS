With the innovation in business, we are changing the architecture of the existing business models.?

 ?Currently, we have 120 people who were recruited on the basis of their industry expertise and innovative thinking. We will hire more in the next few quarters and will have 500 professio- nals by March 2007,? said Nilekani.

 Nilekani said, for every one consultant added at Infosys Consultancy, which is primarily an offshore operations, four jobs are created at Infosys Technologies worldwide.

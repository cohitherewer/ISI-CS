 Calcutta, Jan. 6: Shareholders of Exide Industries have approved the private placement of preferential shares of Rs 10 each to Aranda Investments (Mauritius) at Rs 153 apiece. 

 Post-issue, Singapore-based promoter Chloride Eastern?s stake will be reduced from 51.46 per cent to 48.87 per cent.

 After the shares are allotted, the combined stake of foreign institutional investors in the company will rise from 1.89 per cent to 6.83 per cent. Total non-promoter holding will increase from 28.28 to 31.9 per cent. 

 Aranda will hold 5.04 per cent, while existing FII shareholders will own only 1.79 per cent. Total public holding, including OCBs and others, will be reduced from 20.26 per cent to 19.23 per cent.

 The issue, with a year?s lock-in, will also raise Exide?s paid-up capital from Rs 71.22 crore to Rs 75 crore. The Exide stock is ruling at Rs 170 on bourses.

 At the extraordinary general meeting, executive chairman and CEO S. B. Ganguly said the proceeds of around Rs 58 crore will be used for capacity expansion.

 Ganguly said due to a 56 per cent rise in the price of lead, the company?s profitability might be adversely affected. Thus, Exide will adopt measures at various stages, which will help cut costs by 4-5 per cent. 

 For 2005-06, Exide expects a growth of 18-20 per cent. However, on account of increasing lead prices, the company expects a decline in profitability by 15-16 per cent.

 Ganguly told reporters that the company has approached the Centre to reduce the import duty on lead to 5 per cent from 15 per cent. In other Saarc countries, the import duty on lead is around 5 per cent.

 Exide has also decided to reduce exports in order to cater to the domestic market.

 Calcutta, April 12: The Bengal government is drawing up plans to set up a special economic zone (SEZ) in Siliguri for the tea industry.

 It has identified 100 acres of land near the Dabgram growth centre in Siliguri for the proposed SEZ. The total cost of setting up the SEZ will be Rs 50-Rs 75 crore. 

 The SEZ will house tea processing and blending units. The units in SEZ can import tea without licence and blend it for re-export. 

 They will enjoy certain fiscal incentives in the form of tax concessions and exemption from customs duty on import of capital goods, raw materials, consumables and spares. 

 West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC), which is involved in the project, has asked West Bengal Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBIIDC) to submit a report on the proposed SEZ.

 This will be the fifth SEZ in the state. There are already three zones in the state ? Falta, Manikanchan (gems and jewellery park) and the Calcutta leather complex ? and the government has got the in-principle approval for the fourth SEZ at Kulpi.

 State urban development minister Ashok Bhattacharya said, ?The proposed SEZ will help the tea industry in several ways.?

 However, the tea industry officials are not aware of such a move by the Bengal government. They are also not clear about the way the SEZ can help them.

 Bhattacharya said the state government is also planning to set up a container port in the Siliguri-Jalpaiguri area. Spread over an area of 45 acres, the port will help in handling tea, fruits and flowers ? the three main produce of North Bengal.

 The total cost of the project will be Rs 30 crore and the government will have a 11 per cent stake in it. The state government is keen to rope in a private partner for the project.

 Gopal Krishna, managing director of WBIDC, said the land acquisition for the port will commence in the next three months. The government will also be able to identify the private partner within the same period.

 To facilitate industries in the North Bengal region, the Siliguri-Jalpaiguri Development authority is setting up a cargo-handling facility at Bagdogra with a central government assistance of Rs 3 crore.

 Bhattacharya added that chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has requested Prime Minister Manmohan Singh as well as the Planning Commission to provide tax holidays to North Bengal as enjoyed by Himachal Pradesh and northeastern states.

 The government is optimistic that the opening up of the Nathula Pass will also help trade between North Bengal and Southeast Asia.

 Calcutta port

 The Calcutta Port, in association with the Tea Board, has applied to the Union ministry of commerce and industry to set up a tea park in the port area. The park is expected to be granted SEZ status.

 The park, which will comprise a tea processing and packaging unit, will be set up on 14 acres of land near the port at an estimated cost of Rs 28 crore. 

 It will enable exporters to bring in raw tea, process and package it on the spot, thus reducing transaction time and enhancing export potential.

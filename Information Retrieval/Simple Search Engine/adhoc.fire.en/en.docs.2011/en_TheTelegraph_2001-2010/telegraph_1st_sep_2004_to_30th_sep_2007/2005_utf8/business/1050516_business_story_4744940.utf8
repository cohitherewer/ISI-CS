 Q amp;A

 Gain theory

 Can long-term and short-term capital gains be added to the total income to avail tax rebate ?

 Prasanta Kumar Mallik, Ranchi 

 Short-term capital gains are included in the gross total income of an individual for allowing deductions and rebate, whereas long-term capital gains are taxed separately

 Deduction ambit

 Going through this years budget measures, I found that from the current financial year, every individual is allowed a consolidated limit of Rs 1 lakh under section 80C for savings in specified instruments, which will be allowed as deduction from total income. Will this deduction also include pension and medical insurance scheme under Chapter VIA?

 Amal. K. Ray, Sodepur

 Investment in pension has been included under the 

 total deduction limit of Rs 1 lakh, while the medical 

 insurance premium continues is a deduction under chapter 

 VIA.

 Permutation, combination

 A, B and C are family members. A has opened an MIS account jointly with B amounting to Rs 6 lakh. Can C open another MIS account with B for Rs 3 lakh?

 N. Roy, by e-mail

 The individual investment limit in post office MIS is Rs 3 lakh. In a joint account, the individual share is calculated proportionately. Thus, the investment of A and B will be taken as Rs 3 lakh each, which means they have exhausted their limits. Thus, B cannot open another account with C.

 At your service

 We had purchased a 550 square feet flat in an old building and paid registration fees. Now we are paying property tax to the municipality. Since the building has more than 12 dwelling units, shall we have to pay service tax?

 Alfred M. J, Calcutta

 You dont have to pay service tax to stay in a flat. It is paid only when fresh construction or repair work is done.

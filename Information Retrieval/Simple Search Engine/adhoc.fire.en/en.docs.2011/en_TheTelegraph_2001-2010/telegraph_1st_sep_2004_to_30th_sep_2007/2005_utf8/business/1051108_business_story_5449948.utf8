 Microsoft lead suitor for AOL

 Philadelphia, Nov. 7 (Reuters): Microsoft Corp., the worlds largest software maker, has emerged as the lead suitor for a stake in Time Warner Inc.s Internet unit America Online (AOL), according to a report by The New York Times.

 Microsoft aims to fold its MSN Internet service into a venture with AOL, the newspaper said, adding that any agreement would be several weeks away.

 One issue that has yet to be resolved would be how the venture would be governed. Time Warner does not want to cede control unless it receives a quot;very rich offer, quot; the NYT said. 

 Microsoft and Time Warner could not be immediately reached for comment.

 Other suitors seeking a stake in AOL include Google Inc., Comcast Corporation, Yahoo Inc. and News Corporation, sources familiar with the situation previously told Reuters.

 Microsoft has launched its corporate database software program aimed at taking market share from Oracle Corp.

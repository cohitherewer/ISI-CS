 Terms set for rural banks insurance foray

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 13: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will allow regional rural banks (RRBs) to undertake insurance business on a referral basis without any risk participation if they meet a few conditions.

 In a notification issued on Thursday, the RBI said the banks should comply with the IRDA regulations to undertake referral business with insurance companies.

 The banks cannot force their customers to go in for a particular insurance company in respect of assets financed by them. Customers should be allowed to exercise their own choice.

 RRBs need to enter into an agreement with an insurance company before allowing it to use the premises and the existing infrastructure of a bank. 

 The agreement should be for a period not exceeding three years in the first instance and the bank should have the discretion to renegotiate the terms depending on its satisfaction with the service or replace it by another agreement after the initial period. Thereafter, the bank will be free to sign a longer-term contract with the boards approval, it said.

 The Reserve Bank has also stipulated that there would be no linkage either directly or indirectly between the services offered by the bank and use of the insurance products. It said as the participation by a banks customer in insurance products is purely on a voluntary basis, it should be stated in all publicity material distributed by the bank in a prominent way.

 Moreover, the risk, if any, involved in referral arrangement should not get transferred to the business of the bank. RBI said the banks need not obtain its prior approval to undertake referral business.

 Under the referral arrangement, banks provide infrastructure in select branch premises to insurance firms for selling their products to the banks customers with adequate disclosure and transparency, and in turn earn referral fees on the basis of the premia collected. 

 This relaxation by the RBI comes at a time when the financial performance of RRBs have considerably improved. A plan is now being formulated for the merger of select RRBs in the country.

 FII fear fans stock slide

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 23: Heavy selling on the bourses today pulled down the key BSE index by 135 points. 

 Foreign institutional investors are finding Indian shares expensive and their investments have slowed down considerably in the recent past. Moreover, brokers said traders are not keen on carrying forward their F amp; positions as bearish clouds loom large.

 Investors are also worried at the likely hike of petrol and diesel prices because of firm crude oil prices. Moreover, such a move will stoke inflationary pressures.

 In todays trading, investors were seen squaring off positions ahead of the expiry of the August contract. While this triggered the 135-point fall initially, the selling only intensified on worries about stretched valuations.

 The 30-share sensex opened positive at 7764.86 and managed to touch an intra-day high of 7770.83. It later dropped to the days low of 7601.34 before ending the day at 7615.99 against yesterdays 7750.60, a net fall of 134.61 points or 1.74 per cent.

 The widespread selling was evident as nearly all the indices ended in the negative territory. Also, there was a huge gap between advances and declines. Among the various indices, the capital gains index was the biggest loser in percentage terms as it lost 3.58 per cent or 87.50 points. 

 The BSE mid-cap and the small-cap indices also bore the brunt of the selling pressure. While the BSE mid-cap index plummeted 93.13 points, the small-cap index lost 181.64 points. Many shares in these two categories had scored spectacular gains in the recent bull run. Heavyweights like RIL, Infosys, ICICI Bank, Ranbaxy, ONGC, SBI and Tata Steel recorded sharp falls. 

 Similar trends could be seen on the NSE as well with the S amp;P CNX Nifty extending its fall to the fourth day. The index plunged by 42 points to end at 2326.10. 

 It opened marginally higher at 2369.55 and after rising further to 2380.50, turned weak and hit a low of 2320.35, before finishing at 2326.10.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Private oil firms lose out in retail race

 S. P. S. PANNU

 Trying times 

 New Delhi, March 17: Private oil majors Reliance Industries and Essar Oil are lagging behind the public sector companies in the fierce competition for setting up more petrol pumps. 

 According to the data available with the petroleum ministry, Reliance has been able to put in place a small network of 274 petrol pumps, while Essar Oil has established only 230 such retail outlets. Global major Shell has not yet registered a blip on the petroleum ministry radar screen. 

 In contrast, Indian Oil Corporation has set up as many as 1,000 petrol pumps during 2004-05 taking its total network past the 10,000-mark. A senior IOC official told The Telegraph that the company had earmarked Rs 1,300 crore for expanding its retail chain during 2004-05. Its subsidiary IBP had allocated Rs 500 crore for the purpose. Similarly, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum have spent Rs 700 to 800 crore in expanding their retail networks this fiscal.

 With the prime space in cities cornered by public sector giants, the private firms have been largely concentrating on the highways for setting up their petrol pumps. 

 According to IOC officials, private companies have been proceeding cautiously in the wake of the fierce competition and have set up their petrol pumps at select points on busy highways. Their sales per pump are reported to be higher than those of the public sector firms. 

 However, since the number of these pumps is limited, they do not pose a major threat to the national oil companies.

 The aggressive manner in which the PSUs have gone about expanding their retail networks has also lowered the rate of return on such investments and in effect pre-empted the private firms from taking a larger share of the pie. 

 Reliance will have to continue its dependence on public sector oil companies to sell the larger chunk of petrol and diesel produced by the Jamnagar refinery. 

 Shell and Reliance were banking on the divestment sweepstakes and had set there eyes on taking over HPCL, BPCL and IBP to establish retail networks. However, with the new government clearly stating that it is against the sale of profitable PSUs, this avenue has been closed.

 Agriculture needs cashseeds of hope

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 25: Agriculture is one of the areas for big-ticket public investment, as outlined in the 2004-05 Economic survey, given that the farm and allied sector is projected to grow at a meagre 1.1 per cent. The survey has asked the government to step up public investment in the agriculture support system.

 The Economic Survey today apprehended a 6-million-tonne fall in foodgrain production from last year?s 212 million tonnes because of deficient monsoon. 

 The survey said production in the current year has been adversely affected by erratic and delayed monsoon with uneven distribution of rainfall over time and regions. 

 The advance estimates for 2004-05 shows that there is a slump of 1.1 per cent in agricultural growth, against 9.6 per cent last year. The second advanced estimates show 206.4 million tonnes of agricultural production for 2004-05 against 212 million tonnes in 2003-04.

 Advocating the need for stepping up public investment in agriculture, the survey said given the compulsions of fiscal consolidation, the choice is between subsidy for price support to crops, fertilisers, irrigation and power on the one hand, and higher public investment in supportive infrastructure for irrigation, roads, electrification, agricultural extension and research on the other hand. 

 The pre-budget survey said there is a paramount need to move Indian agriculture beyond its age-old dependence on the monsoon by bringing more area under irrigation and by better water management. 

 The survey has also said diversification of the rural economy is needed beyond cereals.

 With regard to the WTO regime, it said Indian agriculture faces both opportunities and challenges with liberalisation of domestic and global markets. ?The major challenge is to remain within the system and protect the interests of farmers effectively,? it said.

 The survey has pointed out the special emphasis that needs to be given on micro-finance as it is a valuable tool for fighting poverty and unemployment in rural areas. 

 It says by putting credit, savings, insurance and other basic financial services within their reach, micro finance can let thousands of poor people to overcome poverty and unemployment.

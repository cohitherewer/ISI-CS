 Kamal Nath leads Davos delegation

 New Delhi, Jan. 23 (PTI): Union commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath will lead a high-powered delegation to the Davos World Economic Forum summit beginning January 26. This will be followed by a WTO mini-ministerial meeting.

 The WEF session assumes importance as it is taking place at a time when Indian manufacturing and exports are looking up. Nath will use this opportunity to showcase the country as an ideal destination for foreign direct investment.

 The minister will be accompanied by Kapil Sibal, minister of state for science and technology, and a 50-member CII delegation for the four-day summit.

 With India emerging as a low-cost manufacturing centre for pharmaceuticals, a delegation from the industry is expected to travel with the minister to Switzerland. The pharmaceutical industry is expected to grow by 35 per cent.

 There will be four important meetings during the summit, including a round on how India is meeting WTO obligations, Nath said.

 He will also have discussions with his Chinese counterpart in a bid to further strengthen the growing economic ties between Beijing and New Delhi.

 Apart from interactive sessions with top European CEOs, Nath will utilise the opportunity to build a coalition for tsunami reconstruction.

 He will also meet outgoing US trade representative Robert Zoellick on January 28.

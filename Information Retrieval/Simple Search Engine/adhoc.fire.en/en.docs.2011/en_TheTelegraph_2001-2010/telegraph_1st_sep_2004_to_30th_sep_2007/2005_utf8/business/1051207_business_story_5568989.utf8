 Matrix set to swallow Concord Bio

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 PILL THRILL

 Mumbai, Dec. 6: Hyderabad-based Matrix Laboratories is buying a controlling stake in Concord Biotech, an Ahmedabad-based biotechnology company, for an undisclosed sum. Matrix has signed a pact to this effect with the promoters of Concord.

 Matrix will acquire a 55 per cent stake by purchasing shares from promoters and other shareholders and also by subscribing to fresh shares being issued by Concord on a preferential basis. 

 According to a statement from Matrix Labs, Sudhir Vaid, the main promoter and the managing director of Concord Biotech, and his associates will continue to hold a 29 per cent stake. Other shareholders will hold around 16 per cent.

 Matrix has fermentation facilities (a process by which an organic substance is broken into simpler substances), apart from the US FDA-approved API manufacturing facilities. 

 Vaid and his team will continue to oversee the operations with the guidance of the board, on which Matrix will have a majority representation.

 ?The investment in Concord Biotech is in line with our strategic intent to acquire fermentation technology and manufacturing capabilities. This is a key step in the evolution of Matrix and has come at a time when major fermentation-based products are going off-patent in international markets. This investment will add statins, enzymes and immunosuppressants to our product portfolio. This will widen the range of products offered to Matrix?s customers,? N. Prasad, executive chairman of Matrix, said.

 The acquisition will also add to Matrix?s technology and manufacturing strengths. Matrix will be able to utilise the market potential of the fermentation technology-based products of Concord by leveraging its strong customer base in the global generic market.

 The deal will have synergistic benefits in terms of providing API support to some of the existing and pipeline products of the Belgium-based Docpharma, which is now owned by Matrix. Matrix will be in a position to de-risk its business in terms of product segments.

 ?The acquisition of new technology and manufacturing capabilities through Concord will expand the scope of the contract research amp; manufacturing services. Concord undertakes custom synthesis projects in biotechnology,? Matrix said. 

 Both Matrix and Concord have decided to sign a management contract for key personnel of Concord for a period of five years.

 Strategy meet to jack up ONGC output

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 10: The top management and senior officials of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) gathered in the city today for a three-day brainstorming exercise beginning tomorrow to explore ways to improve the corporations production and firm up future investment plans.

 The conference will deliberate on a four-pronged strategy ? raising the production from the mature fields, increasing the output from the new and marginal fields, bringing in a variety of processes such as improved oil recovery (IOR) and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and implementing new technologies. The discussion agenda will also include how to boost the output of other ancillary services. 

 The meeting will look at a host of issues. Apart from the core question of raising production, an overview of servicing of oil wells, material management and logistics will be conducted. The investments made by ONGC to raise output cannot be successful unless the support services are productive, sources said.

 Besides, the meet will also put forward a well-knit plan to abandon the non-flowing wells. ONGC currently has close to 40 IOR/EOR projects and the meet will look into the possibility of putting them on a fast track.

 The corporation has set a target of increasing its crude oil production to 29 million tonnes by 2008-09 from 24 million tonnes at present. To achieve this, it has already introduced a process called Framework 6-7-8. 

 This process has come ahead of enhanced investments last fiscal. ONGC had invested in excess of Rs 10,000 crore into exploration and production activities. While the investment is expected to go up to Rs 12,000 crore this fiscal, it may exceed Rs 14,000 crore in 2006-07. Next year, ONGC may invest Rs 20,000 crore. Therefore, over a three-year period, the company would have invested in excess of Rs 40,000 crore, the sources added.

 They said this was for the first time that ONGC was organising a summit of such a scale wherein not only the top brass, but officials from its assets and basins would also participate.

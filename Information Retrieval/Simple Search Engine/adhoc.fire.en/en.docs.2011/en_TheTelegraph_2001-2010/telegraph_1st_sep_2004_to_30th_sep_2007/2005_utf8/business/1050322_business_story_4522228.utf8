 Mumbai, March 21: French car major Renault, which won the Formula One at Sepang on Sunday, today formally entered into a joint venture with Mahindra and Mahindra (M amp;M) to manufacture and sale Logan in the Indian market from 2007.

 The agreement was signed by Louis Schweitzer, Renault group chairman and CEO, and M amp;M chairman Keshub Mahindra.

 Mahindras would hold a 51 per cent stake in the venture and Renault 49 per cent. The project will cost Rs 700 crore as M amp;M will use its existing facilities for producing 50,000 cars annually.

 While Logan will be marketed under the brand of Mahindra Renault, M amp;M will use its extensive dealer network to distribute the car in the country. A right-hand version of Logan will also be developed by Renault in partnership with Mahindras to meet the needs of India and other right-hand drive markets.

 Speaking to newspersons following the signing of the agreement, Schweitzer said India could easily absorb 50,000 cars that would be produced in the first stage. ?India is a major growth country and could become the most populated country, which means a huge opportunity for us,? he said.

 He further said though India is 25 times bigger than other developed countries like Spain, its car market is comparatively smaller. ?We have seen that in all countries a car enhances quality and freedom of movement,? he added

 Schweitzer said Renault was also looking at the possibility of establishing a technology centre in India.

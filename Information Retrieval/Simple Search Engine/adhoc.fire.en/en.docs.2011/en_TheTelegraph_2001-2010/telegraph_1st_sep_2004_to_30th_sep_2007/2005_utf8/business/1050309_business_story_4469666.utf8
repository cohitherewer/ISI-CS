 Lafarge picks spots for housing foray

 PINAKI MAJUMDAR 

 Jamshedpur, March 8: Lafarge India, the cement major, is planning to venture into the construction sector.

 Neeraj Akhoury, vice-president (corporate affairs), said the company has identified places like Raipur, Bilaspur, Jamshedpur and its peripheral areas for the ambitious low-cost housing projects. 

 According to Akhoury, the low-cost houses will be initially available in three categories ? Rs 40,000, Rs 60,000 and Rs 1,15,000. These will be promoted by Nidhi Trust, which was recently floated by the company. All senior and junior level officials of the company are members of the trust.

 ?The low-cost housing project in the steel city and its adjoining areas will kick off from April. So far, we have received about 25 enquiries from Kadma, Govindpur, Mosabani and other localities within and outside the city,? Akhoury said. 

 The trust has entered into a tie-up with the Chhattisgarh State Housing Board for developing similar low-cost houses in that state, he added. 

 The company has chosen Jamshedpur, Raipur and Bilaspur in the first phase as Lafarge India has its cement manufacturing units in these cities. 

 As a pilot project, the trust has undertaken two low-cost housing projects, one at Raipur (near the Lafarge cement manufacturing plant), and the Don Bosco Asylum in Calcutta for providing shelter to street children. 

 Elaborating on the company?s housing projects, he said the low-cost houses will be made of necessary materials such as cement, sand and concrete that are required for constructing traditional houses.

 While low-cost houses priced at Rs 40,000 will be built on an area of 215 square feet and have facilities of a bed-room, bathroom, kitchen and a veranda, the other two-category of flats will be built on an area of 347 square feet and 500 square feet and have facilities of two bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom and a spacious veranda.

 The other features of the low-cost housing project includes fabricated mild steel doors, six windows, aluminium doors for bathrooms, inside plaster, 10 ventilation points, concealed electrical wiring, two-point plumbing grills for windows and necessary toilet fittings. The roof of the houses in all the categories will be sloped to avoid vertical expansion.

 Atul Kumar, senior officer (research and development), at Jojobera Cement Plant, who will supervise the project here, said the trust has entered into a pact with Andhra Bank for providing loans to the prospective customers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Global steel rates set to lose shine 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Blunt edge 

 Calcutta, April 26: World Steel Dynamics (WSD), the leading global steel information service, has predicted a $100 softening in steel prices by the third quarter of this year.

 Peter F. Marcus, managing partner of WSD, said global steel prices were soft in most of regions and he expected the prices to bottom out by that time.

 ?Prices are soft in the US, Europe and China. It would bottom out by the third quarter and recover again from then,? Marcus said in Calcutta today.

 Hot-rolled coil (HRC) prices had touched $750 a tonne few months back but it had come down significantly since then. At present, the f..b price is ruling at $620 a tonne.

 In Europe, prices are ruling at $580 a tonne.

 In India, the ruling prices is about $650 a tonne (Rs 29,000 a tonne). A year ago, it was ruling at Rs 22,000 a tonne.

 Top steelmakers here, however, are not entirely agreeing to what Mercus had to say.

 T. Mukherjee, deputy managing director of Tata Steel, said he expected steel prices to remain stable during the year.

 ?There could be some ups and downs. But overall, there will not be much fluctuation,? he added.

 Tata Steel is better insulated from the vagaries of such variations as 60-70 per cent of its flat product production is tied up by annual contracts, which are already in place.

 Analysts say an extended winter and a huge inventory in the US market could trigger the fall in global steel prices.

 ?Steel is not moving in the US. China is not so bad. The US and Europe have witnessed $30-50 a tonne correction in the last fortnight. China too, experienced $10-15 a tonne reduction,? an expert said.

 US automobile companies have stopped picking up steel from the market, resulting in slackening of demand there, he added.

 Industry sources said some of the international companies have announced production cut to reign in on the steel prices. European steel makers like Arcelor and Thyssenkrupp have announced cuts in production and more may follow suit.

 The domestic steel industry is somewhat insulated from the global prices as there was a $50-a-tonne barrier due to marine freight cost and 5 per cent duty advantage on imported steel.

 However, if there are any drastic fall in global rates, spot prices in the Indian market may come down. But it will still be higher than that of last year.

 Some analysts, however, predicted that demand in Europe would go up in two months, while that in Japan and China, may rise in a month.

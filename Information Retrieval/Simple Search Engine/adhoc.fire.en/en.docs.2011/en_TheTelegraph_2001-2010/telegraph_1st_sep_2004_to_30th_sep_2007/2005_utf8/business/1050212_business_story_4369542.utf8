 Jet races down IPO runway 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 11: Jet Airways (India) Ltd today kicked off roadshows for its initial public offering (IPO).

 The offering consists of 1.72 crore shares at a price band of Rs 950-1125 apiece. At the higher end, Jet will raise up to Rs 1942.51 crore from the market. The 100 per cent book-built issue will open for bids on February 18 and close on February 24.

 Even as capital market observers view the pricing as aggressive, they feel that the issue should get a positive response from investors, particularly foreign institutional investors (FIIs).

 This offering comes at a time when the airline is planning to fly to long-haul international destinations. Jet Airways has a 42.3 per cent share (for the six months ended September 30) of the domestic market revenue based on passengers.

 The top management of Jet comprising chairman Naresh Goyal and executive director Saroj Dutta said it plans to acquire 10 Boeing 737 new-generation aircraft from March 2006. 

 The company is also proposing an outlay of Rs 300 crore to buy slots at foreign airports, lease aircraft and provide other infrastructural support. 

 According to Dutta, the Boeing 737 new-generation aircraft would be delivered between March 2006 and November 2007 and would cost upwards of $450 million. The listing price of a Boeing is around $45-60 million, depending on the type of aircraft.

 Dutta said the company could opt for the 737-700, 800 or the 900 series, depending on the market conditions. This will be conveyed to the US-based manufacturer, he added.

 Aviation observers said the company is in talks with South African Airways to lease three Airbus A340 aircraft. While a final agreement has not been inked yet, these aircraft will be used in the Mumbai-London route.

 Under the bilateral agreement with the United Kingdom, the government has allotted Jet seven flights to Heathrow.

 Goyal said he was considering various operations to the US via Europe, once the necessary approvals are in place. 

 Jet has a total fleet strength of 42 aircraft, of which 34 are Boeing 737s while the remaining are ATR 72-500s.

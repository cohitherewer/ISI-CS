 Rural bank rejig on cards

 VIVEK NAIR

 Mumbai, Sept. 17: After initiating the merger of regional rural banks (RRBs) in a state into one single entity, the Centre is now planning to amalgamate the strong RRBs with their sponsor commercial banks. 

 The ministry of finance is evaluating such a plan, which has been triggered by the improved performance of RRBs in the country. Some development is expected by the middle of next year. 

 While many of these banks were steeped in losses at one point of time, at present close to 160 of the 196 RRBs are making profits, bankers said.

 The All India RRB Officers Federation, which recently met Union finance minister P. Chidambaram, confirmed that the finance ministry was considering amalgamating the RRBs with their sponsor banks. He did tell us that the government is considering a merger of some RRBs with their sponsor banks. However, this will not happen immediately, sources said.

 Even as the performance of the RRBs is improving, the government is concerned about their lack of capital. It is, therefore, felt that commercial banks will first be asked to look at the possibility of infusing some capital into these banks following which they will be amalgamated with them. 

 Though many of the RRBs are raking in profits, the main problem is that they lack capital. While the government cannot infuse funds, it will now be up to the sponsor banks to infuse some capital, RRB officials said.

 Such a step may alter the shareholding pattern of the RRBs. At present, sponsor banks hold close to 35 per cent in an RRB. The state government holds 15 per cent and the Centre 50 per cent.

 In the meantime, the government is expected to come out with a formal notification next week regarding the amalgamation of RRBs in a state.

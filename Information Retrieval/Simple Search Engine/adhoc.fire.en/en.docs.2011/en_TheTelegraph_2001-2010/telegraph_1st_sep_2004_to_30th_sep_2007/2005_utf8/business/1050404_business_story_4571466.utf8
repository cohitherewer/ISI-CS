 Lights go out for AES in Orissa

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, April 3: Orissa finally slammed its doors on AES, following through on a February 26 order to revoke its licence if it did not clear unpaid bills in a month.

 The Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC) struck the blow today after a three-member panel, headed by chairman D.C. Sahoo, said AES had not responded.

 AES had control of Central Electricity Supply Company (Cesco) till it decided to quit in July 2001. Cesco supplied power to Khurda, Puri, Nayagarh, Cuttack, Jajpur, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Dhenkanal and Angul districts. 

 The US major owned 51 per cent of Cesco, while the remaining 49 per cent was held by the state through Gridco. Gridco asked OERC to cancel the licence of AES because it did not honour the shareholding agreement.

 Cesco chief executive officer Srikant Paikray has been appointed administrator of the utility till a new chief is found.

 OERC had kept its February 26 order in abeyance till March 31, giving AES a chance to make full payment of tariff dues to Gridco after meeting necessary costs, including employees salary and reduction of loss as benchmarked by the commission. It owed Gridco over Rs 800 crore in bulk-supply tariffs at the time it gave up the management of the distribution company.

 In its order, the commission rejected the business plan that AES had submitted last October, seeking a return to the Cesco management. Gridco had rejected it earlier. 

 AES?s business leader in Orissa, A. Srinivas Rao, said the conditions put forth by OERC were stiff. ?We had sought the support of the government and Gridco. But we did not get the opportunity to explain our position,? he added.

 Sources said AES is considering challenging the order in the Orissa High Court.

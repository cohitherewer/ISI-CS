 Calcutta, May 31: It started as a modest effort to familiarise information, communication and technology (ICT) players with the east and in just three years it has emerged as the biggest ICT exposition in the country.

 The future seems even brighter. In its fourth year, the event ? Infocom 2005 ? is aiming to cross national boundaries and reach out to companies, academics and users of ICT beyond India. 

 To scale up the event, jointly organised by Businessworld, an ABP Ltd publication, and Nasscom, to an international level, the organisers invited representatives from the consulates to a function today and briefed them about the strengths of the show.

 ?Infocom has evolved as the biggest IT exposition in India. Now, we want to make it the biggest IT event in Southeast Asia with participants from across the world,? ABP Ltd managing director Aniruddha Lahiri said during his inaugural address.

 Representatives from Singapore, the Philippines, Germany, Russia, Cyprus, Sri Lanka and Finland were present during the formal announcement of the schedule for Infocom 2005 between December 7 and 11. 

 Representatives of the consular corps assured the organisers that they would publicise Infocom 2005 in their countries to ensure participation in the conference-cum-exhibition.

 This year?s attractions will include over 300 stalls and a job pavilion in 1,50,000 sq ft of air-conditioned exhibition space at the Salt Lake stadium and a matrix of conference tracks with over 100 speakers at Hyatt Regency.

 The five-day show is expected to attract around 2,000 delegates and a footfall of over 150,000, organisers said. 

 ?We are aggressively pitching for international representation and expect over 200 overseas participants, most of them representing small and medium enterprises. 

 We expect delegations from Germany, Russia, the Philippines, Thailand, Bangladesh, China and the UK,? said D. D. Purkayastha, organising secretary of Infocom 2005. 

 G. D. Gautama, Bengal IT secretary, was also present at the meeting. In his presentation, he explained how an event like Infocom has helped in changing the perception about Bengal. 

 ?The state government lays special emphasis on IT and we are confident that the future is linked to the growth in this industry. From the government, we are trying our best to make Infocom successful,? said Gautama.

 Next stop Jharkhand

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 23: Steel tycoon L.N. Mittal today said he would sign an MoU with the Jharkhand government in a couple of weeks to set up a steel plant in the state. 

 Mittals team in Ranchi is negotiating with the state government there. Mittal, who met steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan today, said he had been assured of iron ore supplies to run the plant. Paswan has assured him that a national policy for iron ore was being evolved for new steel manufacturing units and infrastructure problems would be addressed to.

 Mittal said he was looking forward to investing in India as it would help to develop his global business. 

 Last month, Posco signed a deal with the Orissa government. The deal assures 600 mt of iron ore reserves to Posco in return for a 12-mt steel plant in the state.

 Mittal has been trying for sometime to convince the Jharkhand government to part with precious iron ore concessions in and around Chaibasa district where SAIL has its Chiria mines. Mittal, on his part, has promised to set up a modular steel plant whose capacity would eventually go up to 10 million tonnes. 

 High prices of iron ore has forced most steel makers to hunt for ore and many of them are eyeing India as it, along with Brazil, has the largest and richest ore reserves. 

 State governments have also woken up to the possibilities of making money from their locked up mineral wealth and are trying to expedite leases.

 The Jharkhand government has been trying to get back three extremely valuable mining leases from SAIL. If it manages to do so, the state may lease out some of these to private entrepreneurs like Mittal who have shown interest in investing in the state . 

 The Centre had till now maintained that the mines leased out to IISCO some 70 years ago should remain with SAIL to help its expansion plans.

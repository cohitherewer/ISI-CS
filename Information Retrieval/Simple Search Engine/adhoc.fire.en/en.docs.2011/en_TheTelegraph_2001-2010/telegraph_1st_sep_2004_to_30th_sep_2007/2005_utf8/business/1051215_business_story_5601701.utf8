 Calcutta, Dec. 14: Belorussian Autoworks (Belaz), a mining company of Belarus, is looking for a joint venture partner in the state for making mining and road construction machinery.

 The company representatives have already made a visit to the city and have met many prospective partners. They are currently in the process of short listing one of them and will invite the Indian partner to visit their plant in Belarus, said Oleg N. Laptenok, ambassador of Republic of Belarus in India. He was speaking at a session organised by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

 Belaz is engaged in manufacturing open-cast mining equipment and has a range of products including mining dump trucks.

 The company also makes road-construction machinery, special equipment for metallurgical industry and underground transport facilities. It also specialises in designing, developing, producing, mounting and servicing of dump trucks and meets the International Standards Series ISO 9000.

 Many Belarus companies are keen on exploring opportunities in India and there is a major scope for companies operating in the mining and construction sector, explained Laptenok.

 Another Belarus company, Belshina Belarus Tyre Works is also keen on increasing its supply of tyres to India, he mentioned. The company produces 150 different tyre models and 350 moulds every year. Belshina is also in the process of developing new tyres for high-speed cars.

 The current bilateral trade figure between India and Belarus stood at Rs 98.47 crore in 2004-05. There is tremendous scope for diversifying the trade basket and we are extremely keen on doing so, said Laptenok.

 Opec chief predicts oil price fall

 Berlin, Sept. 10 (AFP): Opec general secretary Adnan Shihab-Eldin says current crude prices are too high and are going to fall.

 The fundamentals of the market dont justify a price this high, he told the German weekly Der Spiegel.

 Shihab-Eldin said an energy crisis has been avoided despite the damage caused by hurricane Katrina, which affected the US oil production in the Gulf of exico, and predicted prices would fall.

 Consumers have no reason to panic, he said.We, at Opec, have no interest at all in record oil prices. Nobody should slide into a recession, he added.

 World oil prices slid back from record highs this week.

 New Yorks main contract, light sweet crude for delivery in October, fell 41 cents to close at $64.08 a barrel on Friday.

 Earlier this month, the Iranian oil ministrys head of Opec affairs, Javad Yarjani, said the Opec cartel would decide to raise its oil production quotas by at least 500,000 barrels per day when it meets on September 19-20 in Vienna.

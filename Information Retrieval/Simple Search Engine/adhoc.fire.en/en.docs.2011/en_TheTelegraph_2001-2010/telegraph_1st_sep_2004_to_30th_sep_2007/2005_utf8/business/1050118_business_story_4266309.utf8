 Welspun knits growth plan

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 17: Welspun Gujarat Stahl Rohren plans to increase its exposure in water with its foray into high frequency induction welding (HFIW) pipes for industry and homes.

 ?We have mostly focused on supplying pipelines for major oil and gas companies at home and abroad. Now, with the production of HFIW pipes, we will put an equal thrust on water,? said Vijay Phatarphekar, president (marketing), Welspun Gujarat Stahl Rohren.

 The company has started HFIW pipe production in the first phase of its Rs 285-crore expansion project at Anjar in Gujarat. 

 Phatarphekar said the plant will commence production of spiral SAW pipes in the second phase, which will commence within 15 days. The new plant will also produce longitudinal SAW pipes in the final phase of the project, which will commence within the next three months. 

 ?The new plant will treble the production capacity of the company. It can produce pipes of up to 100 inches diameter, which till now was restricted to 16-60 inches, said Phatarphekar.

 Welspun Gujarat had achieved a turnover of Rs 880 crore in 2003-04. ?Due to the cyclical nature of our business, we hope to achieve a similar turnover in the current fiscal also. However, we have an order book backlog of Rs 1,050 crore and hope to witness a substantial growth in the turnover next fiscal,? Phatarphekar said.

 The company has recently won a Rs 500-crore order to supply coated pipes to National Iranian Gas Company in Iran following stiff competition from European and Japanese pipe mill majors. The order entails supply of 69,000 tonnes per 100 km of coated pipes by January-February 2006. ?Depending on the cycles, exports constitute 30-60 per cent of our total turnover. 

 In the last six months of 2004, the company had received three export orders in excess of $100 million,? said Phataphekar. The company has received the Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC) award for its export performance during 2001-02 and 2002-03.

 During 2001-02, Welspun Gujarat had exported pipes in excess of Rs 135 crore, which constituted about 47 per cent of its turnover. In 2002-03, it exported Rs 288 crore, which contributed to about 72 per cent of its turnover.

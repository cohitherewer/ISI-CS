 SBI Life widens investor Horizon

 Unit - Linked Insurance products 

 are in and SBI Life is the latest to jump on to the bandwagon 

 with Horizon. The policy is a life cover with market-related 

 returns. Also, the allocation of the policyholders 

 investment portfolio is done at no extra cost.

 This market-linked policy is available in two plans. Plan A is a dynamic one that invests a higher proportion of the investors money in equities during the initial years, thus offering higher returns over longer terms. However, as the plan proceeds towards maturity, the debt-to-equity ratio changes and funds are automatically rebalanced towards safer assets. The plan is an ideal investment for those who wish to lock their funds for over a 15-year period.

 Plan B is a growth plan where investments are more balanced. Premium collected is put into less risky options. The investment in equity is much lower. Investors are advised to invest in this scheme for 10-15 years.

 The unique feature of this policy is the ?automatic asset allocation?. This means the policyholder does not need to monitor his investments or switch his portfolio or ?time? the market.

 Horizon will essentially invest in three categories of funds ? equity, bonds and money market.

 Minimum age for purchasing this policy is 14 years and maximum is 60 years. Maximum age of life cover, however, is 70 years. Minimum term period of investment is 10 years and maximum is 40 years. Mode of premium payment can be monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annually.

 The life cover amount is calculated at 10 times the annualised premium. Minimum amount is Rs 1,20,000 and maximum is Rs 10 lakh.

 For women policyholders, there is a 5 per cent rebate on risk premium.

 Citibank profit rises 35%

 New York, Oct. 17 (Reuters): Citigroup Inc. on Monday said third-quarter profit rose 35 per cent as growth in investment banking and a gain from the sale of insurance businesses helped offset consumer banking weakness and the impact of Hurricane Katrina.

 Net income for the New York-based company increased to $7.14 billion, or $1.38 per share, from $5.31 billion, or $1.02, a year earlier.

 A 35 per cent increase in corporate and investment banking revenue helped offset slowing growth at Citigroups consumer bank, where the narrowing gap between long- and short-term rates crimped margins and a pickup in bankruptcy filings increased credit costs.

 Results included a $2.12-billion gain for the July 1 sale of Travelers Life amp; Annuity and most of Citigroups international insurance business to MetLife Inc. The bank took a charge of $222 million, or 4 cents per share, from Katrina.

 Profit from continuing operations fell 1 per cent to $4.99 billion, or 97 cents per share.

 Analysts on average expected earnings of 98 cents per share, and on that basis Citigroup reported $1.01, according to Reuters Estimates.

History will be kind to Chidambaram

Stock Taking / Shankar Sharma

One of the biggest problems with Indian policy-making 

has been incrementalism. By this, what I mean is that almost nobody takes big 

steps, in formulating policy. The imperatives are to take small, measured steps, 

and stick to the beaten track. If one traces the history of policy-making in India, 

very few milestones stand out. The first one, of course, would be the Nehruvian 

model of self-reliance, and state-owned capitalism.

This policy has been pilloried by all and sundry but 

it has been the state-owned sector that has built truly world-level scale and 

has also been at the cutting edge of technology and research. 

A good case in point is Bhel, whose home-grown technology 

in power equipment has withstood competition from MNCs.

Then came Rajiv Gandhi?s vision, back in 1984-85, 

to push telecom and information technology. One has to credit him with truly outstanding 

vision, since Microsoft had not even been born then! Twenty years later, the results 

are there for all to see. 

Then, we had Manmohan Singh of 1991: throw the country 

open to FDI/FII flows, reduce tariffs and devalue the currency.

Measures born out of a crisis, but nevertheless, laid 

the foundations for a corporate competitiveness boom, that has made Indian companies 

survive and thrive in a liberalised environment. 

And, finally, you had Chidambaram in 1997 who slashed 

tax rates to among the lowest in the world. The economists and accountants fretted 

that the deficit would widen, since revenues would not match up. That?s precisely 

what happened.But only in the short term. 

Today, tax compliance has gone up remarkably. The 

base of tax payers has shot up dramatically. And consumer spending was kick-started,as 

individuals got more money to spend. It was a virtuous cycle that took a while 

to become real. But it did happen as planned eventually.

In my opinion, deficits don?t matter as long as you 

spend the deficit sensibly. The US has run deficits on both the internal and external 

accounts since time immemorial. Has it hurt the US economy? No. On the contrary, 

deficits have kept delivering growth, which has kept industry humming, and the 

stock markets booming, over decades. 

In India, too, we need to get one thing straight: 

Growth, and only growth, can balance the books. Nothing else. And if in the pursuit 

of growth, you run a deficit, so be it. Deficits will sort themselves out. In 

the 1990s, the US ran a balanced budget precisely because it grew at breakneck 

pace.

Budgets are like the annual board meeting of a country. 

The CEO lays down the roadmap. The smart CEO presents a plan that may or may not 

satisfy the markets immediately, but as long as the plan strengthens the company?s 

competitiveness, and builds scale, the stock price will take care of itself.

For a change, the stock market?s reaction has been 

sensible. Despite the absence of the traditional chapter on ?Sops for the Capital 

Markets?, it has seen the far-reaching foundations the current budget has laid 

down. 

Budgets cannot be judged through the narrow lens of 

the either the stock-market?s immediate reaction, nor can they be judged in a 

12-month accounting period. Budgets have to be judged only in long-term hindsight. 

Frankly, I don?t care if the stock market tanks tomorrow. 

If India achieves its true destiny as a result of this budget I will be happy.

My gut feeling tells me: history will be very kind 

to this budget. And so will the markets.

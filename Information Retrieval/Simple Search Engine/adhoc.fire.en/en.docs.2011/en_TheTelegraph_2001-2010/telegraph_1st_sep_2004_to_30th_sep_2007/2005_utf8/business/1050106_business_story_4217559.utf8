 Twin knowledge parks for semiconductor firms

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 5: Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT-K) has proposed twin knowledge parks in Kharagpur and Calcutta for semiconductor companies.

 The domestic semiconductor industry is currently concentrated in the south and north, with Interra as the sole representative in Calcutta. The semiconductor industry in India is estimated between $400 million and $500 million and employs around 12,000 people.

 In a presentation before the Bengal government today, the premier institute suggested ways to attract investments in VLSI-related (very large scale integration) firms and sought assistance in setting up a design centre cluster.

 Partha Pratim Chakraborty, dean of sponsored research at IIT-K, said, ?India wants to establish itself as the education hub, research wing and manufacturing centre of the world. In all these areas, we face huge challenges from the US, Europe and China, which are far ahead of us and have established themselves. The only way to make a mark is to work in niche areas that require high technological skills but low investments.?

 IIT-K was keen to collaborate with technological inputs for the design centre and procure skilled talent from institutes in the state, Chakraborty added.

 The institute is in the process of preparing a concrete proposal for the knowledge parks and design centre.

 State IT minister Manabendra Mukherjee said, ?Calcutta is uniquely placed with four major institutions. The semiconductor industry should look at the city as the base for its academic initiatives.?

 The India Semiconductor Association (ISA) has initiated a plan to churn out 10,000 trained professionals for the industry through a countrywide network of 200 teachers. 

 State IT secretary G. D. Gautama said the government will ask the Academic Council, representing all major institutes in the state, to interact with the ISA on collaboration issues.

 IIT-K has also successfully worked on projects involving micro electronic mechanical systems (MEMS), which is the integration of mechanical elements, sensors, actuators, and electronics on a common silicon substrate through microfabrication technology. A fabrication unit for MEMS costs around Rs 20 crore against an investment of Rs 2000 crore for a full-fledged chip manufacturing centre.

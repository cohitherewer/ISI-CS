 Good times ahead

 New Delhi, Nov. 23: Employees in India ? workers and executives ? can rejoice once again. They can expect big salary increases for the second consecutive year.

 Hewitt Associates, the global HR outsourcing and consultancy firm, has come out with its annual report that shows India recorded the highest average salary increase in the Asia-Pacific region in 2005 at 13.9 per cent.

 The trend is expected to continue in 2006 with just 2.6 per cent of employers expecting a salary freeze next year.

 India?s IT sector employees were rewarded with the highest average increase at 17.9 per cent among the five industry groups covered by the survey.

 Employers are reporting that they are paying higher salaries to their staff and the trend is expected to continue in 2006, the survey says.

 Asia?s markets have demonstrated further growth last year, which has impacted salaries throughout the region, it adds.

 The Philippines has recorded an impressive average overall salary increase of 8.2 per cent, which was closely followed by China at 8.1 per cent. As Thailand?s economy continues to strengthen, employees enjoyed an average salary increase of 6.3 per cent.

 Malaysia?s salary increase ranged between 5.4 and 6.1 per cent and Singapore saw increases ranging between 3.4 and 4.3 per cent. Salaries also rose in Australia, Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

 ?As companies around the world continue to invest significant resources in Asia, they not only boost local economies, but local employment markets as well. And with an increasing number of organisations turning their attention to countries such as India and China, it comes as no surprise that salary increases in these markets were among the highest in the region,? the survey adds.

 Asia looks set for slow but steady economic growth in 2006 and many employers are demonstrating their faith in the region by projecting similar salary increases next year.

 Fewer companies have reported salary freezes for 2005 than 2004 and this improvement looks set to continue into 2006, the survey adds.

 In Korea, 5 per cent of survey participants said they expect a salary freeze compared with 4 per cent in China and 3 per cent in the Philippines. Only 2 per cent of employers in India and 2 per cent in Hong Kong say they expect a salary freeze in 2006. Linking objectives to performance continues to be popular in Asia. Fixed bonuses were also popular this year with Taiwan and Singapore topping the list. 

 Employee attrition is a growing concern in Asia and the rates rose in most markets, The highest employee turnover was in the Philippines at 18.1 per cent with India recording a 13.1 per cent rate and China a little higher at 14.4 per cent.

 BSNL offer to win govt staff

 M. RAJENDRAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 18: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) aims to accomplish two objectives with one SIM card.

 The company will issue a subscriber identification module (SIM) card for Rs 100 to win over three million central government and public sector employees.

 According to the proposal, SIM cards will be issued for CellOne post-paid connections to all central, state government and central public sector employees for Rs 100. The connection will be immediately activated on presentation of the employees identification cards. It will not attract charges for activation, STD security and roaming.

 The scheme, valid from October 1 to November 30 as a special offer to the central and state government and central public sector employees, will be announced this week.

 The scheme is to be called BSNL Diwali gift ? A government employee bonanza. Currently, the CellOne per month rental ranges between Rs 300 and Rs 500.

 The scheme will fix monthly rental at Rs 100 per month only.

 It is alleged that a few Indian Telecom Service (ITS) officers, who are at the centre of decision making on commercial aspects at BSNL, are hoping to garner support of other government employees with such a plan.

 With such popular schemes, they hope to get support from the beneficiaries to retain their deemed deputation status in BSNL, which is under threat of severance by the government.

 The BSNL spokesperson confirmed that a proposal for a Rs 100 SIM card for government employees may be taken up by an internal committee in the next few days. 

 He also said this was a routine commercial decision. We will be announcing a slew of such special schemes during the puja. The current proposal is aimed to increase our market share and it is not aimed for publicity of any group.

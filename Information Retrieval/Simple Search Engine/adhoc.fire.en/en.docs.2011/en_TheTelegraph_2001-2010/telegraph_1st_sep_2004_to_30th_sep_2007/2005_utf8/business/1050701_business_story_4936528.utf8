 Calcutta, June 30: The BK Birla group has lined up investments of over Rs 1,000 crore to fund its expansion plans.

 It will infuse about Rs 400 crore to ramp up the cement capacity of flagship Kesoram Industries Ltd and Rs 600 crore in Century Textile to increase the pulp capacity. It will also invest Rs 160 crore to set up a nylon tyre cord facility.

 Kesoram Industries chairman Basant Kumar Birla said the group would concentrate on core businesses only.

 For instance, the group will focus on cement and tyre in Kesoram Industries even though there are other divisions like rayon, chemicals and spun pipes.

 ?We started operations in the controlled era when everything was offered by licences. As we got licences, we added new businesses. Now the situation has changed and we think that cement and tyre are the two core sectors for Kesoram,? the group patriarch said on the sidelines of the 86th annual general meeting of Kesoram Industries.

 He pointed out that professional managers running these companies would spearhead the massive expansion programme.

 ?I have excellent and honest people. They are efficient too,? Birla said.

 In Kesoram Industries, the cement capacity would be stepped up from 1.65 million tonnes (mt) to 4.55 mt.

 Regarding non-core businesses, he said the Rs 1,700-crore company could hive off its chemical interests.

 ?We will exit from this business if there is a buyer,? Birla said.

 The company is yet to hold discussions with potential suitors. It is a very small division compared with the company?s operations.

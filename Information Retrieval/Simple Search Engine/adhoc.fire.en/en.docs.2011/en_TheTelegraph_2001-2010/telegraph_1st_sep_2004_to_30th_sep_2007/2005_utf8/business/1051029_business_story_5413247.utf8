 Indian Oil back in black

 OUR BUREAU

 Oct. 28: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has bounced back from the red to record a net profit of Rs 949.72 crore for the second quarter (July-September) of this fiscal. The company had ended the first quarter with a net loss of Rs 54 crore as it was forced to sell kerosene, LPG, petrol and diesel way below the market rates.

 Chairman S. Behuria said IOCs net profit for the first six months at Rs 895 crore is much lower than Rs 2,712 crore earned last year. He said this is primarily due to the non-realisation of market-related prices for LPG, kerosene, petrol and diesel.

 Twin offers to power Hyundai sales

 RAJA GHOSHAL 

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: Hyundai Motor India is gearing up for two mega car launches. The Korean car maker is going to launch its mini sports utility vehicle (SUV) ? the Tucson ?by the middle of the year and its luxury brand Sonata by the end of the year. 

 Sources at Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) said, ?The Tucson will be priced between Rs 13 lakh and Rs 15 lakh and will most probably be launched around March or April. It will be a completely built unit (CBU) and will be available in both petrol and diesel versions.? 

 The other car from the Hyundai stable will be the New Sonata, which was unveiled in South Korea and the US with great fanfare last year. 

 It?s called the New Sonata in the American market and it may be used here as well though no decision has yet been taken.

 Company sources said the strategy is to let the Tucson be a volume driver. The Tuscon was launched by the company as part of its international portfolio last year. The New Sonata, on its part, has won the car of the year award in America. 

 Hyundai is already represented in the SUV segment with the Terracan, which is priced at Rs 19.33 lakh. The Terracan is also a CBU, unlike the other Hyundai models, which are all manufactured at its plant near Chennai. 

 Hyundai chairman Chung Mong-Koo announced in Chennai yesterday that the company would build another plant in Chennai, which would be completed by the middle of 2007.

 However, company officials were tight-lipped about the specific models to be made in the new plant. 

 The New Sonata is expected to have a European profile and a sophisticated look.

 The New Sonata has been given a complete makeover. The design that was first unveiled in Seoul in the middle of last year will wind its way into India later this year, said sources. 

 The merging twin-eyed looks of the Sonata will be gone and in its place will be simple, unpretentious straight lines all around the car. Sonata , which is available in three versions in India, is priced between Rs 11.3 lakh and Rs 15.2 lakh. 

 The new offerings are part of Hyundai?s strategy to tap the high growth potential of the domestic market, especially the focused niche segments. Meanwhile, the export of company? two models ? the Santro and the Accent ? is growing at more than 100 per cent. The company exported 75,871 units in 2004 against 30,416 units in 2003.

 Gillette quarterly figures top estimate

 Shining edge

 New York, May 5 (Reuters): Gillette Co, the maker of razors and Duracell batteries, on Thursday reported its quarterly profit rose by 19 per cent, benefiting from extra shipping days, and said it would raise North American battery prices in August.

 Both earnings and sales in the first quarter topped Wall Street estimates.

 Gillette, which agreed in January to be acquired by Procter amp; Gamble Co, said profit rose to $449 million, or 45 cents per share, from $376 million, or 37 cents per share, a year earlier. Net sales jumped 17 per cent to $2.61 billion.

 Analysts, on average, expected Boston-based Gillette to earn 43 cents per share on a revenue of $2.44 billion.

 ?Gillette reported another quarter well ahead of analyst expectations on the top and bottomline, even after charges to clean up its balance sheet in advance of its acquisition by P amp;G,? said Deutsche Bank analyst William Schmitz, who has a ?hold? rating on Gillette and a ?buy? on Procter amp; Gamble.

 Gillette did not give new details about its planned acquisition by Procter amp; Gamble, but echoed earlier comments that the deal should give it better access to emerging markets, such as China, where P amp;G has a greater reach.

 ?We like Gillette on a stand-alone basis and we like it more combined with Procter,? said Banc of America Securities analyst April Scee, who has ?buy? ratings on both stocks. ?We continue to believe that the market is too strenuously questioning the timing and rationale for the transaction, and would be buyers on weakness with the caveat that we see no definitive near-term catalyst.? 

 Shares of Gillette slipped 19 cents to $52.66 in morning trading, while shares of P amp;G dropped 10 cents to $55.04.

 P amp;G will swap 0.975 shares of its stock for each Gillette share in the deal, to be voted on by investors in mid-June.

 Arbitragers and institutional investors essentially now trade Gillette shares based on what P amp;G is going to pay, and not on the companys fundamentals.

 ?While the result is a slight positive, we believe it will not be enough to drive P amp;Gs stock up,? JP Morgan analyst John Faucher, who has an ?overweight? rating on Gillette and a ?neutral? rating on P amp;G, said in a research note.

 Gillette, which reported a notable growth in Russia, Turkey and Eastern Europe, got a boost from five additional days in the first quarter of 2005 versus 2004.

 Gillette did not quantify how the extra days helped in the quarter, but Faucher estimated they added 8 per cent in sales.

 Favourable foreign exchange added 3 percentage points to the net sales gain, the company said.

 Gillette said it would raise prices on Duracell alkaline batteries by 6 per cent to 7 per cent in North America, effective August 15, due to higher raw material costs.

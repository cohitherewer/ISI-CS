 Calcutta, June 2: i-flex Solutions plans to recruit more than 8000 professionals in the next 18 months to increase its staff strength by 67 per cent.

 Deepak Ghaisas, chief executive officer (India operations), said, We plan to double the headcount in the centre of excellence at both Pune and Mumbai from 2500 to 5000 in the next four to six quarters.

 UltraTech cements growth plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Birla: Focused

 Mumbai, Aug. 24: More than a year after UltraTech Cement Ltd became part of the AV Birla empire, group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla has chalked out an elaborate plan for taking the unit at the top of the heap in the cement space. The focus is now on improving operational efficiency and bringing down debts of the company.

 On the debt front, UltraTech hopes to bring down its total debt to equity capital below 1:1 over a span of three years. According to Birla, this will be achieved through internal accruals and repaying high-cost debts.

 The company has already initiated the financial restructuring exercise. Last fiscal saw the company mobilising Rs 500 crore internally and repaying Rs 612 crore of long-term borrowings. 

 This brought down the borrowing cost of the company to 6.8 per cent at the end of 2004-05 from 7.7 per cent a year ago. It is expected to come down further to 6.5 per cent in the current fiscal.

 The ratio of total debt to equity also came down to 1.44:1 in 2004-05 from 1.54:1 in the previous year. Birla expressed hope that by 2007-08 this ratio would come below 1:1. The AV Birla group chief was responding to shareholder queries at UltraTechs fifth annual general meeting here today.

 This is a part of the companys plan to focus on better utilisation of assets, enhancing efficiencies, reining in tightly on costs of power, fuel and logistics besides leveraging synergies with the groups flagship, Grasim Industries.

 UltraTech is also planning to invest close to Rs 600 crore in setting up a captive lignite-based power plant at its Gujarat plant.

 According to Birla, the cost saving on account of the captive power plant will be to the tune of Rs 110 crore annually. After its commissioning, the UltraTechs cost of power will come down to Rs 2.21 per unit from the existing Rs 4.60 per unit.

 To leverage UltraTechs synergy with Grasim Industries in matters of procurement of raw materials, logistics, task forces have been formed which will also look into the sharing of best practices between the two companies.

 Shareholders present in the meeting wanted to know if there were any plans to merge UltraTech with Grasim and whether the management is also looking to amalgamate Narmada Cement with UltraTech. Birla, however, denied any merger plan as of now.

 Calcutta, Dec. 19: After becoming a private company last month, UTI Mutual Fund is mulling aggressive foray with new products catering to investors across all risk profiles.

 We are going to kick-start the initiative by announcing three new products within a week. The schemes will be open for subscription in January, said U.K. Sinha, managing director and chief executive officer, UTI Mutual Fund. We will offer both pure equity and balanced schemes to cater to investors with various risk profiles, he added.

 The countrys largest fund house currently manages Rs 25,500 crore worth of assets and has an investor base of 67.7 lakh across 50 schemes.

 The mutual fund industry has so far been able to tap only a tiny fraction of the potential investors in the country ? the whole industry is serving just one crore investors, elaborated Sinha. Being the pioneer asset management company in the country, UTI will take initiatives to increase the reach of mutual funds to more people, he added.

 UTI Asset Management Company became a private company last month with the four sponsors, Life Insurance Corporation of India, State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and Bank of Baroda paying back the government its equity worth Rs 1,236.95 crore in the company. Each sponsor now owns a 25 per cent stake in the company and under the terms of the new agreement, the owners will not be allowed to change their shareholding pattern.

 We are also keen to increase our exposure in the overseas market through the offshore funds, said Sinha.

 UTI Mutual Fund is also exploring investment opportunities in emerging sectors like the knowledge process outsourcing, textiles and biotech through the private equity and venture capital arm, UTI Venture Funds, said D. S. R. Murthy, executive director, UTI Asset Management Company.

 And, the move has also started paying off. IBM has struck a preferred relationship with us because of our investments in the technology products and companies, said Rajakumar, managing director and chief executive officer, UTI Venture Funds. The computer giant is also weighing options to pick up a stake in UTI Venture Funds. 

 UTI Venture Funds floated a $150-million fund in April. The fund has received encouraging responses from top investors across West Asia, Singapore and Europe. The fund has mobilised $140 million as soft commitment from the investors and we are expecting to close it with a total collection of $180 million by March next year, Rajakumar added.

 The Government of India has shortlisted UTI, along with LIC and SBI, as the fund managers for the National Investment Fund ? a composite fund constructed with the proceeds disinvestment of public sector units. The returns generated by this fund will be used for social sector projects.

 Telecom firms told to bare all on tariffs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Fair Play

 New Delhi, June 29: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has asked operators to provide customers with details of their tariff plans within a week of activating the service.

 The regulator has also directed the operators to intimate any changes in tariff of the chosen package in writing to subscribers.

 Trai has issued these orders after receiving complaints from consumers regarding inconsistencies in billing by operators.

 Subscribers said while taking new connections through franchisees/agents of telecom companies, they were promised a lower tariff for calls and certain facilities like caller line identification and free roaming. However, when they received their bills, they were charged at a higher rate and had to pay for services which were not mentioned in the chosen package.

 Trai has also pulled up telecom operators for not adhering to its directions issued early last month to make available tariff brochures at retail outlets with complete details of plans and financial implications for various usage slabs.

 We have information that complete tariff details or brochures are not being shown to those visiting the franchisees to apply for a new connection. The lack of information on complete details of tariff plans in such cases had led to complaints and consequent customer dissatisfaction, said a senior Trai official.

 Trai has extended the date to receive comments on a consultation paper to draft measures to promote competition in the international private leased circuits (IPLC) segment. Written comments of stakeholders on this consultation paper were requested by June 30. The comments can be now submitted till July 6. 

 Trai also released a study paper on Indicators for Telecom Growth today. This paper brings out the growth of the telecom sector in pre- and post-reform periods. The paper also brings out the impact of various regulatory and licensing policies and decisions on the growth of services.

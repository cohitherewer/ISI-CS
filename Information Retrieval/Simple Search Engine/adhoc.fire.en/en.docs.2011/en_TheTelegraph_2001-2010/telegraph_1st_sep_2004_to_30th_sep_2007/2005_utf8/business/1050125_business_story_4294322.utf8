 Videocon sets sights on LG perch

 Dhoot: Aiming high

 New Delhi, Jan. 24: Consumer appliance maker Videocon International is preparing to mount a serious challenge to LG Electronics India Ltd (LGEIL) and try and knock it off its perch as it sets its eyes on a turnover of Rs 9,000 crore in 2005-06.

 LG is the one to beat in the consumer appliance market. Recently, LGEIL managing director K. R. Kim said the local arm of the Korean chaebol quot;expects to cross a turnover of Rs 9,000 crore in 2005?.

 Clearly, Videocon has its work cut out for itself. Venugopal Dhoot, chairman and managing director of the Videocon Group, told The Telegraph, ?The group?s turnover expected in 2004-05 is around Rs 7,500 crore and, in 2005-06, it will touch the Rs 9,000-crore mark.?

 With this the battle between the two consumer appliance makers could be well joined. LG has seen its turnover rise from Rs 4,500 crore in 2003 to Rs 6,500 crore last year on which it earned a net profit of Rs 300 crore.

 The consumer durables and home appliances major claims that it is growing at an compounded annual growth rate of 40 per cent against the industry average of 6-7 per cent. 

 Charting out an aggressive growth strategy, LG hopes that contributions from its colour television, information technology and GSM segment will push its turnover to Rs 50,000 crore over the next five years.

 Videocon is betting on its expansion plans with Calcutta-centric Videocon International intending to make a foray into manufacturing colour picture tubes (CPTs).

 It will invest Rs 700 crore to establish a plant at Bhuj in Gujarat, which will be set up in two years. While the CPTs will be utilised in Videocon?s own brands of CTVs, the company also plans to sell it in the local and international markets.

 ?We will invest Rs 1500 crore in a colour TV glass project to raise capacity from 16 million units to 40 million. Funding will be through internal accruals, quot; said Dhoot.

 According to the latest data collated by ORG till November last year, LG tops the colour, conventional and flat TV market segment with a market share of 25.5 per cent, 25 per cent and 26.9 per cent respectively.

 At present, Videocon exports glass shell required for making CPTs to overseas markets, including Indonesia and Bangkok. 

 According to a company spokesperson, the glass shells, funnels and panels manufactured (for making CPTs), covers 18 per cent of the company?s cost of making televisions.

 The company has seven television manufacturing plants across Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Bangalore, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh.

 Earning nearly 10 per cent of its turnover from the exports of televisions, Videocon later this year plans to introduce its X-lent series and Plasma TVs.

 The company has set aside an amount of Rs 250-300 crore for its advertisement and promotion campaign, said Dhoot.

 Tyco quarterly profit rises

 Boston, Aug. 2 (Reuters): Tyco International Ltd has posted a rise in quarterly profit, boosted by strong earnings from its health-care business and a one-time gain from the sale of a fibre-optic cable unit.

 Net income in the third quarter ended on June 30 rose to $1.19 billion, or 56 cents per share from $922.6 million, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier.

 Sales rose 3.3 per cent to $10.56 billion. 

 Excluding one-time charges and gains, Tyco earned 50 cents per share.

 Analysts on an average had forecast quarterly earnings of 49 cents per share on sales of $10.67 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.

 Tyco, whose products range from hypodermic needles to electronic components, lowered its full- year earnings and cash flow outlook in May, prompting some investors to question the pace of progress with the companys restructuring.

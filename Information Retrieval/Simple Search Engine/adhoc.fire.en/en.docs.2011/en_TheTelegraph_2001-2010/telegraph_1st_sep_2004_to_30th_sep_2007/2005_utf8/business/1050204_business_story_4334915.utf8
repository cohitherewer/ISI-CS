 Pureit quenches Lever thirst for new

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 3: Hindustan Lever Ltd has launched Pureit ? a gadget that purifies water.

 Dubbed by the company as the world?s most advanced water purifier, Pureit has been introduced in Chennai only at present, where it was test marketed for several months.

 ?Pureit provides water that is as safe as boiled without electricity or continuous tap-water supply. It is based on a patented technological breakthrough by HLL,? the company said.

 It is the first gadget the FMCG major has introduced in the Indian markets. A Pureit unit will cost Rs 1500. The company, which over the past few years underwent a drastic overhaul of its product category, is for the first time stepping into the FMCG gadget segment.

 The only recurring cost will involve replacing Pureit?s Germ Kill Battery, the company said. The battery, priced at Rs 250, lasts for 1500 litres. As a result, a consumer gets six litres of water just for Re 1 or spends 17 paise per litre.

 The company vouches for the product by saying that it provides 100 per cent protection from water-borne diseases like jaundice, diarrhoea, typhoid and cholera.

 Pureit also removes pesticides that may be present in drinking water. 

 Pureit meets the germkill standard of the toughest regulatory agency in the US ? the EPA ? for protection against viruses, bacteria and parasites, and getting microbiologically safe drinking water.

 This patented technological breakthrough has been developed and guaranteed by Hindustan Lever. A team of over 100 Indian and international experts from HLL and Unilever research centres has devoted over five years to develop this purifier.

 The performance of Pureit has also been tested by leading scientific and medical institutions at home and abroad. 

 The product will be useful given the prevalence of waterborne diseases. Government statistics show that every fortnight 19 per cent of all children below three years suffer diarrhoeal diseases, alongside countless other episodes of major water borne illnesses like jaundice, typhoid, cholera, and worm infestations.

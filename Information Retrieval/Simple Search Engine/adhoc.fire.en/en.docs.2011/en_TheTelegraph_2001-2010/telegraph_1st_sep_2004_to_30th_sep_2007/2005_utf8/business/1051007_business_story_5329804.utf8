The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Overseas call cartel under scanner

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) will look into the existence of cartels in the international long-distance (ILD) business.

 Communications minister Dayanidhi Maran had alleged that there was a cartel of Reliance Infocomm, VSNL and Bharti in the long-distance telephone segment, obstructing competition. He asked the telecom watchdog to take necessary action against the three operators. He also said the government would soon bring down the entry fee for the ILD business.

 The move has been opposed by the existing ILD operators, who feel they should be compensated as they had paid a higher entry fee.

 We are aware of the ministers views and will examine if there is a cartel. Cartelisation occurs when many strong players are competing. In the telecom sector, it is not new. There have been earlier instances, Trai chairman Pradeep Baijal said on the sidelines of an open house on number portability.

 The telecom regulator today received a mixed response on the issue of portability. Mobile operators have opposed the introduction of number portability, while customers have sought its immediate implementation.

 The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) wants a minimum time of four months before any discussion is initiated.

 The association pointed out that portability has been most successful in countries with over 100 per cent tele-density like Denmark, Finland and Hong Kong.

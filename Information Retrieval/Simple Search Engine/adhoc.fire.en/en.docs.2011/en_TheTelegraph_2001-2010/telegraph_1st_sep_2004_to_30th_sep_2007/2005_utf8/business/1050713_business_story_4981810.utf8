 LIC pledges Rs 100 cr to realty fund

 GARIMA SINGH

 New Delhi, July 12: Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) has committed Rs 100 crore for the Rs 1,000-crore IL amp;FS Infrastructure Realty fund. 

 We gave a commitment to them last month. However, unless they tie up the entire amount, we will not disburse the fund from our side, said S.C. Bhargav, LICs executive director-investment.

 The IL amp;FS realty fund opened last week and the group is looking at participation from various players. 

 We are looking at participation from at least 15 to 20 other players. These will be mainly institutional and not retail investors. It will include large corporate houses, banks, and insurance companies, said Shahzad Dalal, vice-chairman and managing director, IL amp;FS Investment Managers Limited. 

 He added, We might get international participation as well. But this will take a minimum of 3 to 4 months.

 The realty fund is sponsored by IL amp;FS and managed by its asset management company ? Investment Managers Limited. 

 LIC, however, declined to explain why it only chose to invest in the IL amp;FS realty fund when other real estate venture capital funds of ICICI Bank and HDFC were already present in the market. 

 Dalal said, Our core competence will lie in focusing on infrastructure projects.

 The state-owned corporation expects to generate investible funds worth Rs 100,000 crore in the current financial year. 

 According to the norms laid down by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA), LIC can invest up to 10 per cent in these funds.

 Sources say there are fewer investment options for LIC as it is losing out to banks when it comes to corporate lending. Banks are offering cheaper loans, said another LIC official. 

 India Inc borrowed funds worth Rs 900 crore from the state life insurer in 2004-05. This was against a higher figure of Rs 1,000 crore in the preceding financial year. 

 While banks offer relatively cheaper loans, companies prefer short-term funds. LIC, on the other hand, has a preference to look at long-term funding opportunities of 5 to 15 years. 

 Sources say LIC is also investing directly in the real estate construction business where it owns a few plots of land. 

 The corporation has decided to introduce a new policy whereby it will identify the actual users of the property prior to investment in the commercial space. 

 Increasing the thrust on construction for investment purposes, LIC has set up a separate strategic business unit (SBU) focused on real estate development.

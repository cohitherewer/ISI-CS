 Hyundai stumps US auto makers 

 GREG SCHNEIDER

 Detroit, Jan. 18: The car made a dramatic entrance, lowered by chains from the ceiling into a cloud of smoke and flashing lights. 

 This was no curvaceous sports car debuting here at the North American International Auto Show. It was an unadorned, four-door sedan: the 2006 Hyundai Sonata. 

 A few years ago, such hype for a Hyundai might have seemed funny, given the South Korean company?s reputation for cheap, shabby products. But this week?s bold unveiling of the Sonata was greeted soberly by rival US automakers, who now compare South Korea to the up-and-coming Japan of the 1980s. 

 Hyundai is wooing and winning American consumers just when Detroit?s Big Three thought they had enough of a fight on their hands trying to take back market share from the decades-long onslaught of Toyota Motor Corp, Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor. 

 The rollout of the redesigned Sonata is a sign of how much more cutthroat the US auto market could become in the next few years, with most experts convinced that China will soon follow with inexpensive products of its own. 

 ?I think Detroit has the potential to be in serious trouble. They?re just being bombarded,? said Art Spinella, an auto industry expert with the consulting company CNW Marketing Research in Oregon. 

 Hyundai has reached this point gradually, increasing its sales for the past six years in a row after stumbling badly in the 1980s with poor-quality products. 

 Last year, the company overtook Honda and Nissan to become the worlds seventh-biggest automaker. Also last year, US consumers rated Hyundai and Honda as tied for second-best in overall quality in an influential J. D. Power and Associates survey ? ahead of Mercedes-Benz and behind only Toyota. 

 Beginning this fall, Hyundai will start producing Sonatas at its first American plant in Montgomery. The new version is bigger than either of the industrys current top mid-size sedans, the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.

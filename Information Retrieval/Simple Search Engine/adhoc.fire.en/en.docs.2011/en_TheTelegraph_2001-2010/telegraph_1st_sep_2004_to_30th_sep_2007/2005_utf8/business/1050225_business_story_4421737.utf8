 Sebi extends identity code deadline

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 24: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has extended the date of obtaining a Unique Identification Number (UIN) to December 31 from March 31.

 A central database of Securities Market Participants? and Investors? Identification Numbers (Mapin) has been set up by the market regulator under the Sebi (Central Database of Market Participants) Regulations, 2003.

 While the market watchdog has been expanding the reach of the database in a phased manner, it has been specifying at periodic intervals the categories of individuals and entities that are required to obtain a UIN under the Mapin regulations.

 Sebi said as of date, total number of registrants in this database is 2 lakh, comprising 1.48 lakh individuals and 52, 000 companies and intermediaries.

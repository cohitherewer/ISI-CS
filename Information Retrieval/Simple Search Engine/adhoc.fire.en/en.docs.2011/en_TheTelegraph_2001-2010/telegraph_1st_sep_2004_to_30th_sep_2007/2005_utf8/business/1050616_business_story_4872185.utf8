 Tata Metaliks to up capacity

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 15: Tata Metaliks, the largest producer of foundry grade pig iron in the country, is planning to double its capacity in the next two to three years from the present level of 320,000 tonnes.

 The capacity expansion can be either through greenfield ventures or acquisitions, Harsh Jha, managing director of TML, said.

 He confirmed the company was looking at acquisitions in the western and southern markets.

 There are some target companies in those regions, he said without divulging any details.

 At present, the only manufacturing unit of the company is in Kharagpur. Though TML services customers in the west and south, freight charges make its product costlier. 

 While setting up a new plant will cost TML around Rs 300 crore, investment in a brownfield venture will be about Rs 200 crore.

 We are aiming a capacity of 600,000 to 700,000 tonne in the next two to three years, Jha said.

 TML will be debottlenecking the capacity at it Kharagpur plant to jack it up to 350,000 tonnes.

 TML is also exploring the possibility of setting up a steel making unit at Kharagpur. The company has appointed MN Dastur to prepare a feasibility report.

 TML is looking at 400,000-800,000 tonnes of billet making capacity. To begin with, Tata Steel, the parent company of TML, will buy the entire production. Later on it will sell to other companies as well. Jha said the final plan will be completed in two to three months.

 The company has sought additional 500 acres in Kharagpur, adjacent to its existing works, for the long products (billet) facility.

 Howrah helpdesk

 TML today opened a helpdesk in the heart of the foundry belt of Howrah. It will provide a bouquet of end-to-end services ?supplying feedstock, cupola related services, optimising production processes and facilitating chemical analysis of raw materials.

 It will also help small foundries market their products through its chain. TML intends to set up such helpdesks in other regions as well.

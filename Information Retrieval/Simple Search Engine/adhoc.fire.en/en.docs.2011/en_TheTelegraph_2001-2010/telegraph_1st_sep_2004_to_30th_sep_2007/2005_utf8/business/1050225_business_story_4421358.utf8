 Charter for better telecom service

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Fault repair

 New Delhi, Feb. 24: If the telecom regulator has its way, fixed-line telephony operators will have to fix the gremlins that snap your phone links in seven days and mobile service providers will have to give you on air as soon as you register. Phone fault repairs can take no longer than 24 hours.

 Is that a telecom El Dorado? The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has released a common charter of telecommunication services that seeks to create one.

 The charter directs operators to allow telephone users to call emergency services like police, fire and ambulance for a period of 15 days after the telephone connection is suspended.

 The operators will have to abide by the terms of the charter, which also stipulates supply of information on directory services and provision of satisfactory connectivity and interconnectivity to the extent of their respective legal obligations under relevant interconnection agreements.

 Consumers will also be a part of the compact: they must clear all their dues within the specified time.

 The charter was finalised in consultation with non-governmental organisations (NGOs)/consumer advocacy groups (CAGs) and representatives of various telecom service providers.

 The charter acknowledges the rights of the citizens to have free choice in selecting their service providers.

 It also aims to promote consumers? right to education, representation and redress that the service provider needs to provide them.

 It also highlights the agreement by the service providers to inform the subscribers of the broad range of services, individual plans, tariff rates applicable to each of these plans, their validity, terms and conditions of payments.

 Bank of Baroda in no mood to hike rates

 Khandelwal: Easy money

 Mumbai, Dec. 19 (PTI): Bank of Baroda has ruled out a hike in interest rates for the moment, chairman and managing director Anil K. Khandelwal said today. 

 We are into a new age of banking. Hence, nothing can be said beforehand. But, we are not considering a hike in interest rates as of now, Khandelwal said, while rolling out the banks first core banking solution at the Powai branch here.

 Replying to a question, he said there was also pressure on the bank for deposit mobilisation, except low-cost ones, which were on the rise. The bank is, however, open to all routes for mobilising deposits, including certificate of deposits (CDs), he added. The bank has no exposure to CDs at the moment.

 All alternative sources of deposits mobilisation are to be looked at, provided the situation so demands, Khandelwal said.

 He also said the bank had already paid up the amount due for IMD redemption, and added that would not affect the banks balance sheet.

 On the banks performance in the current quarter, he said, We are definitely moving on the right track and the credit growth will be maintained in the remaining period of the year. 

 Speaking on the banks proposed public offer, which is expected to hit the market within a few weeks, Khandelwal said the road shows for the offer would soon start.

 As a public sector bank, retail investors would be our focus, he said, adding other nitty-gritty of the issue had not been finalised yet.

 Meanwhile, the BoB chairman said the banks 125 branches, including nine in Oman and UAE, would be brought under core banking solution within the current fiscal and 600 branches in the next fiscal.

 By 2008-09, we will have 1,900 branches under the CBS, covering almost 80 per cent of the banks business, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Govt for labour consensus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 23: The UPA government wants to take the Left into confidence before introducing any labour reforms.

 The move to convince the Left has been initiated by the Prime Ministers office. Union labour secretary K.M. Sahni visited Calcutta recently to hold talks with Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on the proposed reforms.

 I have asked the labour secretary to first convince the central trade unions. We cannot take the decision independently, Bhattacharjee said at the national council of the Confederation of Indian Industry today.

 Bhattacharjee, who is keenly following the changes in the Chinese labour laws, made his views clear on the labour flexibility. Foreign investors want professionalism. But that should not give way to slave labourers. We dont like the hire-and-fire policy. We have to protect the interest of the labour class.

 He was replying to a question raised by Arun Bharat Ram, chairman of SRF Limited and past president of CII, on labour flexibility.

 On privatisation, Bhattacharjee said even though people talk about the Chinese economy, almost two-thirds of these companies are still under government control.

 We will not allow divestment in profit-making PSUs. These PSUs form the backbone of the Indian economy, he said.

 However, Jamshyd Godrej, managing director of Godrej amp; Boyce, told Bhattacharjee that a recent study carried out by OECD shows that 75 per cent of the Chinese economy is now under private control.

 Bhattacharjee said foreign direct investment is welcome in his state, which had attracted an investment of Rs 2,700 crore in the last financial year. 

 Only 15 per cent of this was FDI. I am trying hard to woo FDI in my state, he added.

 To attract foreign direct investment, the Bengal government is sending the state commerce and industry minister, Nirupam Sen, to China to have talks with the Chinese investors. 

 We have already identified the Chinese companies with whom we will have discussions, added Bhattacharjee.

 Calcutta, July 29: Exide Industries will invest Rs 410 crore in ING Vysya Life Insurance over the next four years.

 ?We are acquiring the 49.13-per-cent stake held by GMR Industries Ltd at a cash payment of Rs 203.2 crore,? said S.B. Ganguly, executive chairman and chief executive officer of Exide Industries Ltd. 

 Exide will buy another 0.87 per cent stake in the insurance firm at Rs 28.5 crore. ?With this, we will hold a 50 per cent interest in the company,? Ganguly said on the sidelines of the company?s annual general meeting held today.

 Following this, ING Vysya Life?s capital would increase to Rs 440 crore from Rs 390 crore.

 ?We will also invest another Rs 175 crore in warrants of ING Vysya Life. Of this, Rs 17.5 crore will be invested this year and the remaining over the next four years to meet capital requirements,? Ganguly said.

 Following Exide?s acquisition, the ING group would continue to hold 26 per cent, the maximum stake currently allowed under FDI regulations, in the company. Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd will have a 14.87 per cent stake and Enam 9.13 per cent.

 ?We are not disturbing the business and will be making this investment from the company?s free surplus,? he added.

 As on March 31, the reserves and surplus of Exide Industries stood at Rs 410 crore, including free reserves of Rs 350 crore. Of the free reserves, Rs 250 crore is invested in readily marketable and short-term securities.

 ?Also, we have been generating a post-tax cash flow of Rs 200 crore per annum for the last five years, of which Rs 60-70 crore is investible surplus,? he said.

 ?We believe that the Indian life insurance business is in a growth phase. ING Vysya is well placed to capitalise on this with ING being the fourth largest financial company and second largest life insurance player globally.?

 ?We will have a 50 per cent representation on the board of ING Vysya Life and an equal management control. However, we plan to let ING run the show and be an investor in the company,? Ganguly explained.

 In the current fiscal, Exide expects a 20-25 per cent growth in revenues and 30 per cent growth in net profit.

 IISCO gets approval for asset sale

 Letting go

 Calcutta, Jan. 11: The Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) has given its nod to Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO) for the sale of its surplus assets.

 Based on the recommendations of an asset sale committee and the company board, the Steel Authority of India subsidiary had sought BIFR approval for the sale of the sheet mill equipment lying idle at its Burnpur steel plant in Bengal.

 ?On consideration of the case, the bench approves the recommendations of ASC for sale of the sheet mill equipment to the highest bidder, at the price approved by the asset panel (Rs 6.51 crore),? the order says.

 To part-finance the rehabilitation cost of the company, the sanctioned scheme with cut-off date as April 1, 2003 envisages sale of the company?s surplus or redundant assets, through an asset sale committee according to the BIFR guidelines, the bench observed. In June 2004, IISCO informed the board that such a panel had been constituted by IDBI, the operating agency.

 IISCO sources said the company is identifying other idle assets. In November 2003, the bench had sanctioned a Rs 881-crore revival scheme.

 The company needed Rs 210 crore to meet projected cash losses of Rs 54 crore in the first two years of the recovery run. It proposed rationalisation of excess liabilities, besides offering to pay statutory dues of Rs 144 crore and long-term margin money on working capital of Rs 12 crore. The funds were to be raised by selling non-core assets and through market borrowings.

 IISCO, which makes pig iron, steel, ferrous and non-ferrous castings and spun pipes, was incorporated in 1918 in the private sector. 

 The company has a steel plant at Burnpur and captive iron ore mines at Gua and Chiria in Jharkhand. It has captive collieries at Chasnalla and Jitpur in Jharkhand and Ramnagore in Bengal, a foundry and spun pipe-making plant at Kulti (Bengal) and a nationwide marketing set-up. 

 The company was taken over by the Centre in 1972, nationalised in 1976 and made a subsidiary of Steel Authority of India.

 Last year, IISCO saw its mining leases for two blocks in Chiria (Ajitaburu and Sukrilatur) and one in Gua (Jhilikburu?I) cancelled by the Jharkhand government. 

 Officials said the firm is preparing a fresh application to get back the mining rights. ?We will file an application with the Jharkhand government in 90 days,? they added.

 Calcutta, March 3: The massive reconstruction work in Indonesia, as a fallout of the devastating tsunami in last December, seems to have opened up a new opportunity for Indian firms.

 Construction materials like cement and engineering items are going to be in great demand in that country.

 In order to assess the market in the country as well as in the Asean region as a whole, the Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC) is going to hold an exposition in the Indonesian capital Jakarta to showcase India?s prowess in the engineering sector.

 EEPC chairman Rakesh Shah said there would be demand for iron and steel, cement and everything that goes into a building.

 Ten Asean countries have an engineering goods market worth $252 billion but only $52 billion is inter-regional imports.

 India has only 0.5 per cent share in $200 billion of imports that Asean countries make from outside the region.

 China presently dominates the market.

 Shah said Calcutta was most strategically located and could be used for both sea as well as air trade.

 The engineering export community considers the exposition ? Indiatech ? a major step towards strengthening ties with Asean 

 More than 100 Indian engineering companies are going to take part in the exposition. The Indian delegation will be led by Union minister of state for commerce and industry E. V. K. S. Elangovan.

 The export of engineering goods is witnessing a good growth in the current fiscal and it will account for 18 per cent of the total estimated exports of $75 billion in the current year.

 United States is still the largest importer of Indian engineering goods.

 EEPC is going to commission a warehouse and display facility in Chicago soon to reinforce its presence in the US market. Companies like Tata Motors will be a part of the effort in Chicago, Shah said.

 Tie-up with China

 After the Indiatech in Jakarta, a 20-member EEPC team will head towards China to explore business ties with that country. Shah said Indian companies were looking at complementary relation with their Chinese counterparts. ?We may team up and bid jointly for projects in developed countries in EU,? he said.

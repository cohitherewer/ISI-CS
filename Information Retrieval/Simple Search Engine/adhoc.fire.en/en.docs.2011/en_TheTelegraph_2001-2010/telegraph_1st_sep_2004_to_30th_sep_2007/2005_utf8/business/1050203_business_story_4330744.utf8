 Bulging forex muscle earns S amp;P rating pat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 2: Standard amp; Poor?s (S amp;P) Ratings Services today raised the long-term foreign currency rating on India by one notch to BB+, just below investment grade. The upgrade, S amp;P said, reflects the country?s improved external finances and growth prospects.

 The agency also affirmed the BB+ long-term and short-term local currency ratings and assigning a stable outlook.

 The move comes weeks before finance minister P. Chidambaram announces the 2005-06 budget, which is expected to push economic reforms further. It also coincided with a cabinet decision to allow foreign direct investment (FDI) up to 74 per cent in the telecom industry.

 ?India?s external balance sheet has strengthened markedly, due to reserves accumulation and prudent debt management. This should lower the external liquidity risk arising from its fiscal vulnerability,? said Ping Chew, director of S amp;P?s international public finance group.

 According to the agency, India?s external position is stronger than other countries that enjoy the BB rating; the grade is likely to be maintained in the coming years.

 One of the biggest reasons for the change of mind has been India?s foreign exchange reserves, now more than 20 times its short-term debt and six times the gross financing requirements. These, S amp;P said, mitigate the risk of volatility in external finances and domestic confidence.

 ?The strong growth in exports, particularly services and manufacturing, as well as non-debt foreign capital inflows should alleviate the impact of rising imports,? it said. 

 The agency felt India?s external debt, and the repayments on it, would fall over the next few years because growth will be 6.5-7 per cent in the medium term.

 It singled out the service sector as an area of the economy that is truly dynamic and saw the industry benefiting from gradual deregulation, trade liberalisation and modest improvements in infrastructure. ?The business environment is likely to improve in the coming years, sustaining private investment and growth. The banking system has also looked up with reforms; it can now support a higher growth rate while reducing the contingent risk to the government,? S amp;P observed. 

 Explaining the stable outlook, the rating agency said the term reflects the expectation that the pace of fiscal correction, improvements in the external sector and an increase in growth rate close to India?s potential will be gradual.

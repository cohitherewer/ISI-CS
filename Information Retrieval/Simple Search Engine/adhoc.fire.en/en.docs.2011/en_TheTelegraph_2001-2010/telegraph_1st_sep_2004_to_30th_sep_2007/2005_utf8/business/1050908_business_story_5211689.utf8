The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Order for Airbus finally takes wing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: The Centre today announced it would buy 43 aircraft from Airbus after negotiating a 3.4 per cent cash discount under a counter-deal where 30 per cent of the deal will be paid by exporting goods while the EU aviation giant will invest $175 million in India. 

 The deal was renegotiated last night by a group of ministers headed by finance minister P. Chidambaram after a group of MPs wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh that Malaysias Air Asia got the planes cheaper.

 I am happy to announce that our government has cleared the purchase of 43 Airbus aircraft for Indian Airlines. The value of this contract will be around $2.2 billion, Singh announced on the sidelines of the Indo-EU summit.

 In rupee terms, the deal is worth Rs 9,890 crore, down from Rs 10,237 crore that was quoted earlier. Forty three planes ? 19 A-319s, 4 A-320s and 20 A-321 ? will be bought.

 Indian Airlines will now move to place orders in the next fortnight, said civil aviation minister Praful Patel, who was part of the negotiating team. He described the deal as one where substantial savings had been made.

 Officials said while cash discounts were not huge, the counter-deal, which would see Airbus buying Indian products, could prove to be a boon to local manufacturers. Airbus could buy spares from Hindustan Aeronautics, besides going for software and BPO services. 

 Airbus vice-president Kiran Rao described the final deal as a very aggressive package for Indian Airlines. Asked how it compared with Air Asias prices, Rao said it is comparable to anything we have done in any part of the world.

 Rajya Sabha Congress MP V. Narayanasamy, writing to the Prime Minister, cited a New Straits Times report that said Airbus offered 40 short-haul aircraft to Air Asia at a price substantially lower than that quoted for Indian Airlines.

 Airbus has also promised to set up a $75-million training centre where pilots will learn to fly its aircraft. A maintenance, repair and overhaul facility for these planes will also come up at a cost of $100 million. In addition to that, Airbus will set up a spares warehouse in India.

 The first aircraft will be delivered in the second half of next year; the remaining 42 will arrive at the rate of one every month after the first one. 

 We have been able to get a substantial savings on the original price of Rs 10,237 crore and in the terms and conditions initially offered, Patel said. The government has also managed to get an integrity clause. This is a guarantee for a clean and transparent deal. There is also the most favoured clause in the agreement. In the last round of talks, the airline had managed to lower prices by $63.2 million. The purchase was being funded b loans and credits guaranteed by a sovereign guarantee being given by the Indian government. The Centre now wants to speed up the Air-India deal under which it plans purchase of 50 planes from Boeing.

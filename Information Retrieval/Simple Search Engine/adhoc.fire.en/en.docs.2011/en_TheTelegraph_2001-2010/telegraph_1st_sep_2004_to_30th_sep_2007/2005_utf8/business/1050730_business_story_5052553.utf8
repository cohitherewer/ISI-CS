 Sensex braves rains, hits new high

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 29: The clouds over Mumbai could not cast a shadow on the resilient stock markets; the sensex today touched a new peak of 7,708.59 before closing at a life-time high of 7635.41. 

 However, index heavyweight Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) was a major loser because of the Bombay High fire.

 The day was significant for market regulators and operators as it was the last day of the derivatives settlement for July. There were some initial jitters. Everybody in the market was anxious today, a dealer affiliated to a leading FII brokerage said.

 But overcoming the initial anxiety, the sensex continued the trend of the past few sessions and stormed past 7700. There was hectic short covering by operators on the last day of the July contract in derivatives. The rollover of the derivatives trade went off smoothly.

 The last few days have been extraordinary as the sensex climbed to new peaks for five straight sessions and gained 331 points in the process.

 The futures contract had been extended till today following the unscheduled two- day banking holidays. Moving funds across banks for accumulated settlements on July 27 and 28 was also difficult.

 Early in the day, the index dropped to 7545.79. It bounced back later and even touched a new intra-trade high of 7708.59 before ending the day at 7635.41 compared with Wednesdays close of 7605.03, a net rise of 30.39 points.

 ONGC, the countrys top company by market value, fell 2.8 per cent to Rs 938.45. It, however, recovered from the days low of Rs 880.50. 

 Investors were heartened by the State Bank of India and Reliance Industries quarterly results, announced on Thursday.

 Reliance rose 0.6 per cent to Rs 702.90 and SBI gained 3.2 per cent to Rs 800.80.

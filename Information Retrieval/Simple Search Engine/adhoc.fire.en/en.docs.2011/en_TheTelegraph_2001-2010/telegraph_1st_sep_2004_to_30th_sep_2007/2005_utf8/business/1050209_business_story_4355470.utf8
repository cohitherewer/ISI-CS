 New plan for core projects

 S. P. S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: The government is toying with the idea of floating a Rs 10,000-crore special purpose vehicle (SPV) to fund the viability gap in infrastructure projects. 

 The SPV will focus on rail, road and power projects, especially those connected with the Northeast and Jammu amp; Kashmir regions.

 Sources say the issue was discussed at an inter-ministerial meeting held recently as part of the pre-budget exercise. Interestingly, the government had set up a similar Rs 1,500-crore fund in the last budget as well but the money has not been utilised. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is keen to remove infrastructure bottlenecks that have hamstrung the economy and has also set up a task force to break the impasse. He has identified 6,000 km of highways that need to be built to improve infrastructure in the Northeast and ensure better links with the rest of the country. 

 Last week, the Prime Minister had asked his economic advisory council to come up with recommendations to develop the countrys infrastructure. 

 Council chief C. Rangarajan told reporters after the meeting that the Prime Minister also told them to look into the financial health of the Northeast and Jammu and Kashmir. ?We will give a holistic view of the fiscal conditions in these states in due course of time,? he said.

 The Prime Minister has been emphasising the fact that India is lagging behind the Chinese on the economic front and there is an urgent need to step up the economic growth rate. The massive infrastructure build-up in China contrasts sharply with India and has been the main reason for major global companies preferring to set up their manufacturing bases in that country. 

 This harsh economic reality negated the advantage that India because it is a democracy and possesses a large English-speaking population that is culturally more comfortable in a global context.

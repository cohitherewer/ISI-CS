 Ranbaxy to up stake in Nippon arm

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 11: Ranbaxy Laboratories will raise its stake in Nihon Pharmaceutical Industry ? a subsidiary of Japans Nippon Chemiphar ? from 10 per cent to 50 per cent.

 The new structure recognises the equal commitment of both partners and their intent to grow the generics business in Japan in a collaborative manner, Brian Tempest, CEO and managing director of Ranbaxy, said.

 Ranbaxy entered the Japanese market in 2002 through a strategic alliance with Nippon Chemiphar (NC). It subsequently acquired a 10 per cent stake in NCs generic subsidiary Nihon Pharmaceutical Industry (NPI).

 Malvinder Mohan Singh, president and executive director of Ranbaxy, termed the decision to raise stake in NPI as logical. It flows from the increased comfort level of both partners and their resolve to taken the business to higher levels, he said.

 The 50:50 joint venture exemplified the synergy and the strengths of both the companies, Singh said. Company officials, however, did not reveal the size of the deal.

 Japan ? the worlds second largest pharma market (about $65 billion) ? has a relatively under-developed generics market (about $4 billion amounting to only 6 per cent) compared with other advanced pharmaceutical markets.

 Trading of securitised debt gets cabinet seal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: The government today decided to bring in necessary legislative amendments to allow trading of securitised debt in stock markets.

 The recognition of pass through certificates (PTCs) and mortgaged securities is crucial for growth of the securitised debt market. The listing of such instruments is expected to facilitate trading in them, boosting the secondary market liquidity.

 The cabinet also approved minor amendments to the text of the Saarc multilateral agreement for avoidance of double taxation and mutual administrative assistance in tax matters.

 The amendments to the agreement will be considered and signed at the forthcoming Saarc meeting to be held on November 12 and 13 in Dhaka, finance minister P. Chidambaram told reporters.

 He said the draft had received an in-principle approval by the cabinet in February.

 The agreement would promote mutual administrative assistance and co-operation in tax matters among Saarc countries and provide tax relief to students and teachers pursuing academic interests. 

 A proposal to create a post of registrar general for protection of plant varieties and farmers rights authority was also given the nod. The post will enable India to fulfil its obligation under the trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights of the WTO.

 The cabinet today approved the proposal to amend the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 (SCRA) to provide a legal framework for trading of securitised debt. The amendment would provide for a definition of securitised debt under the definition of securities.

 The securitised debt market has grown substantially in the last one year or so and it is, therefore, necessary to define it and provide trading in securitised debt, Chidambaram said. The biggest beneficiary of the decision is likely to be the housing finance companies. These companies usually enter into long-term mortgage pacts, ranging from 10 to 25 years, with borrowers.

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, April 26: Indian Petrochemicals Corporation (IPCL) today reported a massive 187.9 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 786 crore in 2004-05 against Rs 273 crore in the previous fiscal. 

 A significant fall in raw material costs and a rise in product margins helped the company come up with such good numbers.

 The board of directors has recommended a dividend of Rs 4.50 per share for 2004-05, resulting in a payout of Rs 128 crore, including dividend tax, IPCL said.

 IPCL?s net turnover during the reporting fiscal was Rs 8,199 crore compared with Rs 8,098 crore in 2003-04.

 Raw material costs, including traded goods, fell to Rs 3,747 crore against Rs 4,522 crore in the last fiscal.

 The fourth-quarter net profit rose to Rs 336 crore from Rs 99 crore for the corresponding previous period, while total income was flat at Rs 2,682 crore (Rs 2,642 crore).

 Exports of manufactured products during 2004-05 rose 154 per cent to Rs 1,638 crore from Rs 644 crore in the previous fiscal, while production increased to 5.18 million tonnes against 4.6 million tonnes in the corresponding year. 

 IPCL?s domestic sales rose 24 per cent to Rs 6,493 crore and accounted for 80 per cent of the turnover, excluding trading sales.

 The company said increase in global demand for petrochemical products outpaced the rise in supplies and polymer prices had firmed up. Domestic demand too strengthened, resulting in increased operating ratios and earnings.

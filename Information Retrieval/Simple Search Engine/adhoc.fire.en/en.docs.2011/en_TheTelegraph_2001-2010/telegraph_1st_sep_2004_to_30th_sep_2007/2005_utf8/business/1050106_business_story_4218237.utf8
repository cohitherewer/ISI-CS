 Delta Air halves fares 

 New York, Jan. 5 (Reuters): Delta Air Lines Inc, the No. 3 US carrier, said on Wednesday it is cutting its airfares by as much as 50 per cent for travel in the continental United States. 

 The Atlanta-based airline ? plagued by high costs, weak revenue, high fuel prices and rising competition from discount carriers ? had been expected to make the announcement since early this week. 

 The airline, which is restructuring in a bid to avoid filing for bankruptcy, said that no one-way economy fare would be higher than $499 and no one-way first class fare would be higher than $599. In addition, it is eliminating a restrictive rule that requires a Saturday-night stay. 

 The company also said the new fare program ? dubbed SimpliFares ? would reduce fees for changing tickets by half, to $50 from $100. 

 In addition, the company said it would unveil other changes, including improving its delta.com Web site and quot;revising quot; the food it serves aboard its flights. 

 In August, Delta rolled out a program in Cincinnati to test the discounted fares and the elimination of the Saturday-night stay requirement. 

 Delta averted a bankruptcy filing in October when its pilots agreed to accept lower-cost employment terms. 

 Three major airlines ? including UAL Corps United Airlines ? are currently under bankruptcy protection.

 There has been speculation that other carriers would be forced to match Deltas changes, hurting industry revenue this year. 

 Northwest Airlines Corp, the No. 4 carrier, warned on Tuesday that such changes, if widely adopted, would immediately, adversely and significantly affect industry revenue.

 British Airways 

 British Airways, Europes second-largest airline, will reduce fuel surcharges on cargo this week, but said on Wednesday there were no immediate plans to cut a levy on passenger tickets despite falling oil prices.

 The airlines cargo division, BA World Cargo, said it would cut its fuel surcharge to 20 pence per kilogramme from 23 pence following recent fuel price declines. The decrease takes effect on Thursday.

 Low transaction cost gives a fillip to exports

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 1: Reduced transaction cost on exports has given a boost to India?s overall exports, says industry body Assocham.

 ?The simplification of procedures and complexities that the government introduced over the last six years have significantly reduced transaction cost of Indian exports by 5 per cent,? says a study conducted by Assocham.

 These are largely on products like textiles and garments, engineering goods, pharmaceuticals, computer software and chemicals.

 While transaction costs have reduced across the sectors, maximum cost in terms of present export revenue have come down to 10 per cent from 15 per cent in the textile and garment sector.

 As for engineering goods, the transaction cost has reduced to 5 per cent from 10 per cent. The pharmaceuticals sector also saw it down to 8 per cent from the previous 10 per cent.

 Textiles and garments are one of the major items in India?s exports, accounting for 23.25 per cent of India?s aggregate exports by the end of 2003-04.

 The agro industry is another sector that saw the transaction cost slip from 7.5 per cent to less than 2 per cent.

 Assocham president Mahendra K. Sanghi said rationalisation of procedures has led to a fall in the transaction costs of exports.

 Pipeline plan on course

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: India is looking for equity participation in the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline project and the next round of secretary-level talks will be held here on December 16, a senior petroleum ministry official said today.

 Talks with Iran and Pakistan are proceeding well and there is no US shadow clouding the picture at this point, he said while reacting to the comments by Nicholas Burns, the US under secretary of state, on the project.

 The project is being taken up purely on economic considerations for the countrys energy security and no extraneous factors were influencing the decision, he added.

 He said efforts were on to evolve a project structure that would boost investor confidence in the venture. 

 It would take several rounds of talks between India and Iran and also between Pakistan and India to eventually sign a tripartite framework agreement.

 During his Moscow visit, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had said that the pipeline was being pursued for the energy security of the country and would lead to greater regional co-operation. This is in sharp contrast to Burnss statement, which is confrontationist, the official added.

 The US under-secretary of state had said the pipeline is a distant idea and we hope the project is never consummated. The petroleum ministry official, however, said, We are very clear about the project and are moving ahead with it at a steady pace.

 He said financial consultants had already given an interim report and various equity models had been worked out. But the emphasis is on evolving a project structure that will help the three countries come up with a secure and safe world-class project, he added. 

 Indias security concerns would have tom be of paramount importance as investments in infrastructure such as power plants and fertiliser units based on the gas would be in the region of $ 10 billion, he pointed out.

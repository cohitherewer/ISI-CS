 Tea firms stir duty-cut plea

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Jan. 24: The tea industry has placed a proposal before the Union commerce ministry to withdraw the additional excise duty of Re 1 per kg.

 The new season is only a couple of months away and the industry is desperate to get the funds, which will be used to increase the orthodox production and generic promotion of tea.

 Tea Association of India (TAI) president Suresh Bansal and Arun Kothari, senior vice-president, have met Union commerce minister Kamal Nath late last week to discuss the financial health of the industry.

 The association has asked for a complete withdrawal of additional excise duty. Although two consecutive financial years ? 2003-04 and 2004-05 ? have passed, the ministry is yet to release funds for the development of the tea industry.

 The NDA government, while levying the additional excise duty in the Union Budget of 2003-04 had said the revenue collected will be utilised for the development of the industry.

 The industry feels that the government should immediately announce the incentive/assistance for orthodox production before the commencement of the new tea season so that necessary investments and capacity build-up towards higher orthodox output can be made well in advance.

 The industry can only increase export earnings if it is able to sale more orthodox tea in the global market. The Wana region, which is becoming an important destination for tea exports, favours orthodox tea.

 Bansal said although India is the largest tea-consuming country in the world, its per capita consumption is languishing at 630 grams per annum. ?We need funds to launch a generic promotion campaign to create awareness about Indian tea. This is needed for our survival in the domestic market,? he added.

 The industry has also urged the commerce minister to step up the rate of replantation/rejuvenation for long-term competitiveness given the high age profile of tea bushes. 

 They feel that the current subsidy at 25 per cent of planting cost should be enhanced to 40 per cent.

 As replantation involves substantial funds and loss of crop for an extended period, this will help to compensate these losses.

 The industry has also requested that the central government and state governments should bare 50 per cent of the social and infrastructure cost under the Plantation Labour Act as recommended by the Inter-ministerial Committee constituted in 2002 by the labour ministry. The total cost of labour welfare works out to be Rs 7.17 per kg of tea.

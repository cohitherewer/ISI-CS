 High fares help BA beat forecast

 SKY is the Limit

 London, Nov. 4 (Reuters): British Airways, Europes third-largest airline, posted a better-than-expected 6.5 per cent rise in second-quarter operating profits on Friday due to higher ticket prices and demand for first-and-business class travel.

 BA also raised its forecast for the current year, saying it expected revenues to rise 6-7 per cent as fuel surcharges and higher passenger numbers helped offset higher fuel prices. It had previously forecast revenues to rise 5.5-6.5 per cent.

 This is a reasonable set of results driven by improvements in revenue, seat factor and yield. It is clear, however, that we need to re-energise our drive on controllable costs, BA chief executive Willie Walsh said in a statement.

 BA said operating profit for the three months to end-September was ?261 million ($463.4 million) compared with ?245 million a year ago.

 This was higher than market forecasts of ?236 million.

 The airline also reported a 6.4 per cent rise in October passenger traffic. It said load factor ? a measure of how efficiently it is filling its planes ? was up 0.5 percentage point to 74.7 per cent in the month.

 BA estimated the cost of a strike by BA ground staff at Heathrow in August, which grounded 700 flights, at ?35-45 million but said this did not have a material impact on the results due to flight disruptions in the same period a year ago. BAs pretax earnings were ?241 million, down from ?293 million on the same quarter last year after new accounting rules changed the way the company had to account for the sale of its stake in Australias Qantas Airways.

 Srei issue gets the go-ahead

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 10: The shareholders of Srei Infrastructure Finance Limited today approved the issue of further securities of the company in one or more tranches in the domestic or international markets up to an aggregate amount of Rs 5000 crore.

 The shareholders have also approved re-classification of the authorised share capital of the company. They have also approved an increase in the limit for investments by foreign institutional investors and other non-resident investors up to 74 per cent of the issued and paid up capital.

 The Srei board also approved an issue of global depository receipts (GDRs) in the international market of up to $50 million plus permissible greenshoe option.

 ?Infrastructure has been the core business of our company for the last 15 years and with the growth in this area, we need further capital. Srei is also expanding its business globally. So it is logical for us to look at a GDR issue,? vice-chairman and managing director Hemant Kanoria said.

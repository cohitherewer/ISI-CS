 Power roadmap for villages 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Electricity for all 

 Calcutta, March 6: The Centre has asked all the states to submit a rural electrification roadmap to avail of the funds allocated by the Union finance minister in the budget.

 The Union budget has said a massive programme for rural electrification will kick off in 2005-06. The total funds allocated for the programme is Rs 1100 crore.

 The UPA government?s aim is to provide electricity to 1.25 lakh villages in a span of five years. 

 The focus of the programme will be on the deficient states in the country. The programme envisages creation of a rural electricity distribution backbone, with a 33/11 KV sub-station in each block and at least one distribution transformer in each village. 

 There are 5.87 lakh villages in India, of which only 70135 are electrified till date. Uttar Pradesh occupies the topmost position in the list with 18042 villages not yet being electrified. Bihar comes next in the line with 17491 villages not getting power till date. In Bengal, 7,694 villages are yet to be electrified. 

 Senior officials of the Bengal power department said the government will shortly send a proposal to the central power ministry.

 The industry strongly feels that electrification of the villages will further boost the rural economy and fulfil the government?s goal to provide power to all by 2012.

 To support the programme, the government has already set up a technology mission on rural electricity ? Rural electricity supply technology mission ? under the ministry of power with representatives from other ministries and organisations like Bhel. 

 The Electricity Act, 2003 provides the requisite framework for expediting electrification in rural areas with necessary empowerment. It permits operation of the standalone system in rural areas, independent of regulatory regime. It also provides distribution of electricity in rural areas by non-government organisations and panchayati institutions. The policy framework in this regard to enable streamline and expedite implementation is being prepared separately.

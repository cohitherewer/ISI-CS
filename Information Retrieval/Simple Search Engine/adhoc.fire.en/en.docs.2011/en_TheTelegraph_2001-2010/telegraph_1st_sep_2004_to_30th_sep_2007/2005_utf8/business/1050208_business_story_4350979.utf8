 Strides tightens grip on Latam venture 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 7: Strides Arcolab has consolidated its Latin American operations by acquiring an additional 12.5 per cent in Strides Latina for $6 million, thus raising its stake to 52.5 per cent. 

 Strides bought the stake from Elcemar Almeida and Associates, partners for pharma business in Latin America.

 Subsequent to acquiring the majority stake, the partners in Latin America have been allotted 11,96,662 shares at Rs 200 apiece.

 With this allotment, Elcemar Almeida holds 3.42 per cent of the increased capital of Strides Arcolab.

 The company has also issued 18.35 lakh warrants to the promoters at a price of Rs 193 apiece (to be converted within 18 months into 18.35 lakh shares of Rs 193 each, including a premium of Rs 183 per share).

 Strides Latina is the holding company in which Strides Arcolab now holds a 52.5 per cent stake and the balance is held by Elcemar Almeida. 

 The Brazilian entity, Cellofarma, is fully owned by Strides Latina and it has a 74 per cent stake in the Mexican company, Solara, S.A. de C.V. With this, Strides Arcolab becomes the largest Indian pharma company operating in the $22-billion Latin American market.

 Sales of Strides Arcolab from the Latin American operations stand at Rs 195 crore for the 12-month period ended September 2004.

 ?With the manufacturing facilities in Brazil and Mexico, Strides is now a strong regional player having good management, sales and manufacturing capabilities with technologies and products from India. The consolidation exercise in Latin America will further help us in becoming a significant player in this market.? Strides Arcolab chairman Arun Kumar said.

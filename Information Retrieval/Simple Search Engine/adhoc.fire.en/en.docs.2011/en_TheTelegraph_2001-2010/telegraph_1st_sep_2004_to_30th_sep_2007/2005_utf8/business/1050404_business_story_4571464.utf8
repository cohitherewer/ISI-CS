 VAT vibes: Jury still out on sweep

 Book value 

 New Delhi, April 3 (PTI): The empowered committee on value-added tax is likely to extend the list of items coming under the new regime from 550 to 2,000 to remove anomalies and bring uniformity across states.

 This is important as it will make proper classification of items and give a clear picture of the impact of VAT on prices of various commodities.

 Though the VAT white paper released on January 17 refers to about 550 items, some of the industrially developed states like Maharashtra and Haryana have already classified over 1,000 items as inputs and outputs.

 Sources said the figure in the white paper is ?incorrect?. The Confederation of All India Traders has also pointed out discrepancies in the VAT list and rates of various states.

 VAT panel secretary Ramesh Chandra admitted that there is confusion on the VAT list among states. ?There will be about 2,000 items under VAT,? he said and added that the classification used by commerce and finance ministry will be adopted to classify various items under VAT.

 The number of items coming under 0 per cent, 1 per cent and 4 per cent VAT rates will remain intact; all other items will fall in the 12.5 per cent tax bracket, he said.

 According to the white paper on VAT, 46 natural and unprocessed local products have been exempted from the VAT list. 

 About 270 items, including drugs and medicines, all farm and industrial inputs, capital goods and declared goods will attract a 4 per cent rate. Precious metals like gold and bullion would be taxed at 1 per cent.

 States will have the option of exempting foodgrain or levying a 4 per cent tax in the first year. They have been given the option of taxing tea at the rate of 12.5 per cent or 4 per cent. In both cases, the rate would be reviewed in the next fiscal.

 The remaining items would attract a 12.5 per cent VAT, Chandra said without hazarding a guess on the number of items that can fall under this bracket.

 The empowered panel is likely to meet after June and review the VAT rates to fine-tune the new tax reform further and remove discrepancies. Moreover, the classification adopted by the ministry will bring about uniformity among state-level VAT rates and central taxes like excise and customs.

 This will facilitate easy switch over to a single VAT or goods and services tax later.

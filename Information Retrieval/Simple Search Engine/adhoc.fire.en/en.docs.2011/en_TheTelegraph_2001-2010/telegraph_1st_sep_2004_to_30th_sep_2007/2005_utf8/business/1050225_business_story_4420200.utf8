The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Go-slow on Basell 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 24: Haldia Petrochemicals Limited (HPL) has deferred a decision on Basell Polyolefins till the consortium led by Purnendu Chatterjee of The Chatterjee Group, ICICI ventures and a clutch of US investors wins the final bid for the Dutch petrochem giant. 

 HPL chief executive officer Swapan Bhowmik said: ?HPL will join the consortium once it wins the final bid.?

 Back from a two-week trip to Amsterdam for a preliminary peep into the Dutch company, Bhowmik said it would take the US investors at least a month to put together a bid. 

 The HPL management is preparing a proposal that will be placed before the board as well as the company?s lenders. 

 ?But we will place it only if TCG wins the bid. The board has informally discussed that HPL may consider joining the consortium led by TCG. A formal proposal, which is being worked out by the HPL management now, will be placed once the final bid for Basell is announced,? he added.

 However, if TCG wins control over the Dutch giant, there could be significant gains for HPL. 

 Listing out the probable gains, the CEO said: ?International technology, know-how, global access for its market and supply chain, apart from the obvious prestige factor are the definite gains that can follow from such a deal.?

 DoT spectrum plan goes into a tailspin

 The big picture

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: The communications ministrys plan to release about 100 megahertz (mhz) spectrum space for telecom operators is facing a stiff resistance from its defence counterpart and Doordarshan.

 The department of telecommunications (DoT) has identified this spectrum space in the 600-700 mhz band to meet the immediate needs of telecom operators. Spectrum is a band of airwaves through which voice and data travel. At present, the defence and information and broadcasting ministries hold spectrum in the 600-700 mhz band. Defence uses this spectrum for mobile communications.

 Telecom operators allege that call drops and disturbances are primarily due to lack of spectrum. The services can be improved by setting up more base station towers. However, these will add to the cost of service.

 A meeting of senior DoT officials with the ministries of defence and information and broadcasting on Wednesday failed to resolve the deadlock. Both the ministries have instead sought more spectrum from the government.

 Communications ministry sources said, We are examining the possibility of carving out about 100 mhz, especially around the 600-700 mhz band, which will be used for mobile telecom services using both GSM and CDMA technologies. But, it will depend on other ministries since they are not ready to release any of the bandwidth with them.

 Communications minister Dayanidhi Maran is keen to achieve the 250-million-telephone target by December 2007. But this may not be possible without additional spectrum, telecom companies said. 

 While the 3G spectrum is yet to be discussed with the defence and other ministries, there is pressure on DoT to get spectrum released in any band for 2G technology to meet the immediate demands of operators, communications ministry sources said.

 I amp;B ministry officials have argued that telecom operators would not be able to use this band even if Doordarshan were to vacate it.

 It is not used by any mobile operator in the world, said an I amp;B ministry official. Leading mobile operators, COAI and Auspi acknowledge this claim.

 We will discuss the issue with DoT officials on Friday. It is true that services on this spectrum band has not been approved by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), a COAI executive said. 

 COAI secretary-general T.V. Ramachandran said a meeting has been called to discuss the issue of spectrum allocation but refused to comment on it further. 

 Narendra Kumar Goyal, chairman emeritus Tema, said, There are no equipment available anywhere in the world on this spectrum. But they can be developed and manufactured. It is difficult to set a timeframe for its availability. Manufacturing can start today, but approvals will take time.

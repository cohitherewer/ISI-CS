 Buddha gets the best to fight Purnendu

 OUR BUREAU

 Aug. 4: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is personally monitoring the Bengal governments fight against Purnendu Chatterjee. It was at the behest of Bhattacharjee that solicitor-general Shanti Bhusan today took up the brief for the Bengal government at the company law board (CLB) hearing on Haldia Petrochemicals share allotment case.

 The dimension of the case has changed after todays hearing. I called up petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar this evening and thanked him, said Bhattacharjee at Writers Buildings.

 Chatterjee yesterday moved CLB, challenging the allotment of a 7.5 per cent stake of Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) to Indian Oil Corporation (IOC). The board today reserved an interim order while fixing the final hearing for September 27 and 28. However, the ruling on interim protection is expected in a day or two.

 Lawyers representing TCG accused the Bengal government of secretly and surreptitiously allotting the shares to IOC in violation of its 1994 agreement with TCG. They stressed that TCG enjoyed the first right of refusal for the shares.

 Not only the intent of the government, even the process of share transfer was also questioned during the hearing as it was alleged that the shares were allotted to an outsider in haste even before encashing the Rs 150-crore cheque. 

 TCG said it had no objection to the allotment of the 7.5 per cent stake had Bengal offloaded its 36.7 per cent stake to maintain TCGs status of a majority stakeholder in HPL. 

 Arguing for the state, Bhushan said there was no question of secret allotment of shares to IOC and stressed that CLB was not an appropriate forum to resolve a dispute over the 1994 agreement.

 Bhushan said the allotment to IOC was done following a unanimous decision of the board of directors on November 2, 2004 and Chatterjee was also present at that meeting. An extraordinary general body meeting also passed a unanimous resolution on January 14 this year for allotting the shares to IOC, he added. 

 The public sector company was taken on board as HPL had piled up huge losses and was reeling under a debt burden, said Bhushan.

 Following IOCs entry, HPLs shareholding pattern has changed. Bengal now holds a shade over 29 per cent (Rs 520 crore), The Chatterjee Petrochem, Mauritius has 30.7 per cent (Rs 433 crore), The Chatterjee Petrochem India has 10.99 per cent (Rs 155 crore), Tatas 3.19 per cent (Rs 45 crore) and associates of TCG hold the remaining 18.22 per cent (Rs 257 crore).

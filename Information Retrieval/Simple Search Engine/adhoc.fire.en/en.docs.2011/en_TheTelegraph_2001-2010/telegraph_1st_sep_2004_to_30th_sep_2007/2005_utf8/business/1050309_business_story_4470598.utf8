 GM looks beyond Daewoo

 New Delhi, March 8 (PTI): Piqued by the delay in finalising the deal to acquire the car assembly unit of defunct Daewoo Motor India, General Motors today said it was now ?seriously looking? at other options to expand operations in the country.

 ?We have been negotiating with the creditors for the acquisition of the Daewoo facility to get the small car. Somehow that has got inordinately delayed. So we are looking at other options quite seriously,? GM India president and managing director Aditya Vij said.

 The company, a subsidiary of the world?s biggest carmaker, General Motors, is desperately looking for an entry into the small-car category, which occupies around 80 per cent of the market.

 Even as the company completed a due diligence of the Surajpur plant of Daewoo in August, there has not been much movement thereafter.

 Noting that the plant ?has become virtually junk?, Vij said, ?We will not wait for too long. It is already delayed.?

 ?Our interest has also waned over time. And the issue between the government and creditors has not yet been resolved,? he said.

 To maintain its growth strategy in India, the company has begun looking at other options. While not denying going in for a second car plant in case the Daewoo deal failed to materialise, he said, ?If a small car is due, you need some basic capacity of 60,000-80,000 units in addition. We have some options in mind.?

 Feb. 28: The budget for 2005-06 has presented a blueprint for the development of the rural and agricultural economy, according to India Inc.

 Describing the budget as a ?balanced one?, Onkar S. Kanwar, Ficci president, said it gives a ?clear sense of direction to boost the economy and charts out a path of inclusive growth?.

 Sunil Kant Munjal, CII president, said, ?The finance minister has performed a tough balancing act.?

 Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Aniruddha Lahiri said: ?The focus on rural economy, agriculture and infrastructure will have a spin-off effect on the entire economy.?

 ?The reduction in the corporate tax rate is a boost for industry in general. However, this reduction is offset to some extent by the reduced depreciation rates on plant and machinery items,? he added. 

 Indian Chamber of Commerce president Anup Singh said the minister has tried to make broad-based intervention in every sphere of the economy. 

 BNCCI president S. N. Nundy said the cut in customs duty on capital goods will help grow the indigenous industry.

 Ficci, eastern regional council, chairman, C. K. Dhanuka said earmarking 10 per cent of the budget of each ministry for the development of the Northeast region was an important step.

 Bharat Chamber of Commerce president Santosh Rungta said the budget recognises the economic compulsions of intensification of the reform process, fiscal consolidation and corrections and prudent financial management.

 Mahendra K. Sanghi, president of Assocham, said: ?Tax on the cash withdrawal of over Rs 10,000 from a bank on a single day is a retrograde step.?

 B. Muthuraman, Tata Steel MD, said reduction of the peak rate of customs duty from 20 per cent to 15 per cent would bring down the cost of projects.

 V. S. Jain, SAIL chairman said an increase in excise duty from 12 per cent to 16 per cent would have an adverse impact on prices of iron and steel.

 Exide chief S. B. Ganguly said the 5 per cent import duty on lead would help the battery makers deal more effectively with competition from imports.

 Saroj Kumar Poddar, chairman, Gillette India, said, ?It?s quite a good and positive budget. However the issue of cess is not very clear.? O. P. Lohia, managing director of Indorama Synthetics, said, ?It?s a positive budget for the textiles sector. There is a move to promote processing industries.?

 DCM chairman Ajay S. Shriram said, ?We hope that the private-public partnership is extended to rural areas for farmers.?

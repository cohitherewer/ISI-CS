 Fed rates likely to go up

 Close watch

 Washington, March 22 (Reuters): The Federal Reserve is widely expected to nudge US interest rates up a seventh straight time on Tuesday, but financial markets are wondering whether the central bank may prepare larger moves to muzzle inflation. The policy-making Federal Open Market Committee is expected to announce another quarter-percentage point rise in the bellwether federal funds rate ? to 2.75 per cent. 

 With a rate hike seen as virtually a done deal, financial market interest hinges upon the language the Fed uses to explain its action. 

 The question is whether policy-makers are considering scrapping a forward-looking pledge to keep lifting rates only at a ?measured? pace ? wording adopted in May and taken as meaning modest quarter-point rises. 

 Hefty oil prices that topped $57 a barrel on Monday before retreating and some signs of upward pressure on producer and consumer prices at the start of the year are raising concern in some quarters about the risks of inflation. 

 The Fed will have a fresh read on prices just ahead of the meeting, when the labour department publishes data on February producer, or wholesale, prices. On Wednesday, the department will release February data on consumer prices, the most widely known inflation gauge. 

 In an editorial on Monday, the Wall Street Journal said the Fed must be prepared to deal with ?incipient inflation? by tightening monetary policy, ?and the faster it does the less financial damage there is likely to be down the road?. 

 Still, a poll on Friday found just two of the 19 big Wall Street firms saw a strong likelihood the Fed will jettison the ?measured? language on Tuesday ? a move that would be a necessary prelude to larger rate rises.

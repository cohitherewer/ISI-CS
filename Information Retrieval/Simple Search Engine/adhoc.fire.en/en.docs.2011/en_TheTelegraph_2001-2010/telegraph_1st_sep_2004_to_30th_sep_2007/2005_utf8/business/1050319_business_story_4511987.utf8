 Videocon in Rs 2000-cr oil drill

 Eyeing new blocks

 Mumbai, March 18: Videocon Industries today said it will raise close to Rs 2,000 crore, which will be invested in the petroleum sector.

 The board of directors has approved the issue of global depository receipts and equity shares through a private placement or a rights issue for Rs 2,000 crore, including premium, the company informed the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 The board has given its approval to the increase in authorised equity share capital to Rs 300 crore. An extra-ordinary general meeting will be held on April 13.

 Videocon is reducing its current financial year to nine months. Following this, the year will end on March 31, 2005, instead of June 30, 2005.

 Senior officials of the company said the proceeds of the issue will be used in the petroleum sector. The company is now a part of a consortium for the Ravva oilfield. 

 ?The consortium for the Ravva oilfield is doing very well. Now we have decided to foray into exploration and extraction activities elsewhere. The oil extraction will be done domestically and internationally.

 ?We are on the verge of signing an MoU for production of oil as well as exploration activities in West Asia,? officials said. 

 They added that while the company will look into other territories through MoUs, it is also open to joining hands with major oil companies for placing bids under the new oil exploration policy. 

 ?For this we think around Rs 4,000 crore is required. While Rs 2,000 crore will be raised from the equity market through a GDR or share issue, the balance amount will come from debt and internal accruals,? they pointed out.

 Last December, the Videocon group initiated the merger of Petrocon India, which is engaged in the exploration business, with Videocon Industries. A swap ratio of five shares of Videocon Industries for every two shares of Petrocon India was consequently proposed. Petrocon India, formerly known as Videocon Petroleum, has a stake in the Ravva oil and gas field, off the coast of Andhra Pradesh.

 Last year, the International Arbitration Tribunal in London upheld the governments stand in a dispute over payments from the oilfields. The tribunal ruled that the governments share of profit should be paid by private companies as and when the extracted petroleum was sold.

 It rejected Petrocon?s contention that its licence for producing oil did not set a payment date. However, other partners in the Ravva oilfields had paid the government its share of revenue at the end of each quarter.

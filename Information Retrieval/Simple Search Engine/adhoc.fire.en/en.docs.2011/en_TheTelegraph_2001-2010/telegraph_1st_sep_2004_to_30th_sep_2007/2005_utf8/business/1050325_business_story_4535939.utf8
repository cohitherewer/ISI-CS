 Coal comfort for power firms

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Good tidings

 Calcutta, March 24: Some foreign companies have offered to supply coal at fixed prices to local power companies. 

 Indonesia?s PT Adaro, South Africa?s Xtrata and Australia?s Rio Tinto are among the firms that have pitched for the long-term supply contracts, coal ministry sources said.

 Ministry sources said some of these companies were prepared to enter into five-year arrangements.

 The offer comes at a time when domestic thermal stations are facing supply bottlenecks leading to shortfalls in generation.

 Senior power ministry officials said the foreign companies? eagerness to supply coal at fixed rates stemmed from the fall in international prices since the last six months. International coal prices last year had topped $75 a tonne. 

 The rates are expected to drop further as China begins to ramp up domestic production. Moreover, with western Europe and the US increasingly shifting to gas for power generation, coal demand has dropped considerably. As a result, most of the large companies have shifted focus to India. 

 The coal available from these sources has low ash content though the sulphur content is much higher. As a result, the older thermal power stations will not be able to use it without installing expensive flue gas desulphurisation plants, which will contain sulphur-di-oxide emissions. 

 Only some of the new thermal power plants would be able to use imported coal, since such emission control plants are part of their capital costs.

 A senior Tata Power official said, ?We may look at imported coal if we get it at competitive price.? 

 State-owned power generation stations in the country use coal supplied by the public sector Coal India Limited (CIL). This coal has a high ash content and calorific value of 3200 kilo calories (kcal) per kg. 

 At present, international coal prices with a calorific value of about 6000 kcal costs about $59 per tonne. So far all the imports of coal by domestic thermal stations or trading companies have been on a spot basis. Imported coal was mostly used for blending with domestic thermal.

 Officials of West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited (WBPDCL) said they can also procure coal from outside to maintain a steady supply for their new thermal plants. 

 The foreign coal companies have already made offers to Nagarjuna Power Corporation Ltd (NPCL), which is promoting a 1015-MW interstate power project near Mangalore.

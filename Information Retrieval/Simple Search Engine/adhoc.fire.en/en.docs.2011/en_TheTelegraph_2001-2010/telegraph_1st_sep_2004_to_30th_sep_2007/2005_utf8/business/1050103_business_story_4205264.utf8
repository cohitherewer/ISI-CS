 India Cements focus on ruin repair

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Building from scratch 

 Mumbai, Jan. 2: India Cements Ltd, the beleagured Chennai-based cement manufacturing company, is expecting a surge in demand for the commodity as the tsunami-hit areas in the south get into the reconstruction mode.

 The tsunami has killed more than a lakh of people, apart from causing severe destruction of property, particularly in the southern states. 

 Industry analysts feel that reconstruction of tsunami-affected areas of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh may bring in better tidings for India Cements as it enjoys a high market share in these regions.

 A spurt in demand for cement in these states comes at a time when India Cements is engaged in a debt restructuring exercise. 

 ?Debt restructuring and the extraordinary demand generated from reconstruction of the tsunami-affected states of Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh should result in better realisation for India Cements,? said Khandwala Securities, a Mumbai-based brokerage, in its report. Consequently, the firm has re-rated India Cements scrip to a strong buy.

 An analyst from a foreign brokerage said while cement companies are largely expected to be gainers from the reconstruction of the affected areas, India Cements could stand to gain the most on account of its solid reach in these markets.

 Last month, the company had announced plans to raise close to Rs 655 crore through debentures and warrants primarily issued to bring down its debt levels.

 The cement major had decided to raise this amount through equity-related funds of $57 million (Rs 250 crore) and the balance in debt funds of $92 million (Rs 405 crore). The debentures and warrants will be placed with funds managed by Asia Debt Management Hong Kong Ltd, a foreign investor, through their FII accounts. 

 The company proposes to raise Rs 515 crore by issuing secured debentures, including an optionally convertible portion of Rs 110 crore. 

 Sources said the proposed move was part of the company?s plan to re-finance its existing debt and thus boost its bottomline.

 The first half of this financial year was a disappointment for the entire cement industry with the southern markets faltering. Cement manufacturers expect the scenario to improve in the second half of this financial year translating into a growth rate of around 8 per cent for the industry. 

 The analyst added that the India Cements scrip had been moving upwards recently due to its debt restructuring exercise.

 India Cements, which has a capacity of close to 9 million tonnes in units spread over Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, had earlier taken an aggressive route to grow in the domestic cement industry through acquisitions. 

 However, these moves led to soaring debt levels, which had an impact on the company?s balancesheet. It had to subsequently take up restructuring measures that included divestment of its two cement units, Raasi Cement and Vishaka Cement. 

 In a restructuring move, the company had planned to bring down the size of its workforce and reduce debt liability through sale of assets. 

 The restructuring package, the implementation of which was monitored by IDBI, provided exit options for secured and unsecured lenders. 

 For the six months ended September 30, the company had suffered a net loss of Rs 37.62 crore on net sales of Rs 296.42 crore.

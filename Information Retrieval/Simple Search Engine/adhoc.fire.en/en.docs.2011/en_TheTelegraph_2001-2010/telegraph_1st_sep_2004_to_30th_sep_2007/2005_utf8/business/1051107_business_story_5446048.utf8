 More growth fire than the Dragon

 Morgan Stanley chief economist Stephen Roach is a great fan of India and has often rhapsodised over Indias outsourcing prowess. This time, however, on his third visit in eighteen months to this country, Roach has found something new to enthuse over. He has drawn attention to what he believes is a crucial difference between China and India ? while the formers growth is export and investment-led, Indias growth is more sustainable, because it is based on internal consumption. Roach points to the fact that private consumption currently accounts for 64 per cent of Indian GDP, compared with 42 per cent in China, and concludes that, unlike the export machine that China has built up, Indias consumption-led model of growth is more balanced. In case, all those dire warnings of the unwinding of global imbalances come true, India would be relatively unscathed.

 Although Roach may have noticed it for the first time, private consumption has been around 65 per cent of the GDP level in India for years. The CSO data show that private final consumption expenditure was 66.9 per cent of the GDP at market prices as early as 1993-94. That was higher than the 64.3 per cent of the GDP it reached in 2002-03, or the 63.9 per cent of the GDP in 2003-04. In other words, the growth in consumption that Roach saw in the country was the result of the growth in incomes and especially the growth in metropolitan and urban incomes in the last decade.

 At first sight, the fact that consumption expenditure as a proportion of the GDP has remained constant seems to go counter to several observed facts, such as the rise in retail credit ? ICICI Banks retail assets grew 73 per cent year-on-year in the last quarter ? or the crowds at shopping malls or the vast increase in the number of cars and consumer durables. There are two reasons for the apparent disconnect. First, bank retail lending includes housing loans, which are treated as investment and not consumption ? that removes the bulk of spending. But even after removing housing loans, personal loan growth has been very high, and the only way this squares with the flat consumption to the GDP ratio is by assuming that personal loans are an urban phenomenon restricted to a comparatively small segment of the population, and it has had little effect on the overall consumption expenditure in the country.

 Nevertheless, Roach has a point. Taking Chinese GDP in 2004 [in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms] at $7.262 trillion and taking Roachs estimate of 42 per cent of the GDP being consumption expenditure, the market for consumer goods in China works out to an annual $3.05 trillion. On the other hand, taking Indias PPP GDP in 2004 at $3.319 trillion, then private consumption, at 64 per cent of the GDP, works out to $2.12 trillion. That makes the Indian market for consumer goods at 70 per cent of the Chinese market.

 Of course, the composition of the individual items of consumption will differ, but the broad point holds. Also, at the margin, consumption is rising faster in India than in China, even if we assume that Indias GDP growth rate will be 7 per cent against Chinas 9 per cent. No wonder MNCs are jostling for entry to the Indian retail market.

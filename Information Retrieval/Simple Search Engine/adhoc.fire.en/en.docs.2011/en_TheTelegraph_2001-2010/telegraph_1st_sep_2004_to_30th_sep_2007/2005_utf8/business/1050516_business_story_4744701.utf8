 Calcutta, May 15: A delegation from MAIT, the computer hardware manufacturers association, will visit Taiwan between June 3 and June 9 to study the countrys PC component and optoelectronics industry. The delegation will explore ways of attracting investments in this area.

 Taiwan is the third-largest manufacturer of flat-panel monitors and controls 13 per cent of the global optoelectronics industry. It is among the top three producers of LED packaging, flat-panel monitors, laser discs, disc drives and digital still cameras. 

 The industry is expected to grow by 34 per cent to $47.17 billion this year.

 MAIT executive director Vinnie Mehta said, The idea is to create an environment that will cater to all the requirements of the PC industry and result in a drop in prices, keeping the quality intact. We want to build a bridge between the component industry and the vendors in India to acquire low-cost components.

 The Taiwanese government had put in place a four-year support plan in 2003 and has already trained 3000 technicians for the optoelectronics industry.

 Taiwanese manufacturing has become important even to the United States as prices of low-end desktop PCs and notebooks have dropped.

 You can find just about every PC part you need for a desktop computer in Taiwan, said Mehta. When it is supplied locally, it helps keep prices down. 

 The apex body also wants to enter into outsourcing agreements with Taiwanese manufacturers to help reduce the PC prices by using cheaper components.

 Taiwanese companies already make 66 per cent of the worlds switching power supplies, 85 per cent of desktop scanners, 96 per cent of handheld scanners, 65 per cent of keyboards, 60 per cent of all mouse, 75 per cent of cases and 49 per cent of sound cards.

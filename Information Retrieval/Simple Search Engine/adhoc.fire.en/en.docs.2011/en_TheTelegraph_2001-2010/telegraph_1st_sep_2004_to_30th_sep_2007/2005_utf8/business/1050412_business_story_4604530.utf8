 The VSNL board today accepted the resignation of Ratan Tata and appointed Subodh Bhargava, an independent director on the board since 1999, as the new chairman.

 A company spokesperson said, ?The resignation enables Ratan Tata to directly control and coordinate telecom strategies of the group in India and abroad as chief mentor and strategist.?

 Kishore Chaukar, managing director of Tata Industries, said the group has set a target of achieving ?leadership position? by the next financial year in all aspects of telecom services.

 The capital infusion of Rs 10,000 crore during the next 12 to 16 months will raise the group?s investment in the telecom sector to more than Rs 30,000 crore.

 BoI banks on overseas growth

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL 

 Calcutta, Nov. 13: Bank of India is on an expansion spree overseas. 

 It has got the go-ahead from the Reserve Bank of India to either set up subsidiaries or open branches in six countries ? China, Vietnam, Indonesia, Tanzania, Qatar and Belgium. 

 Chairman and managing director M. Balachandran said, We are now talking to the regulatory authorities in these countries for setting up our operations there. 

 Asked whether the bank is planning any acquisition in these countries, the CMD said, We are examining all possibilities. Unless something concrete comes up, we cannot comment.

 The bank has an office in Belgium, where it has a substantial exposure to diamond and jewellery businesses. A new branch will tighten its grip. 

 Belgium and New York are the two major hubs for the global diamond business and the bank already has an office in New York, too. 

 Almost 20 per cent of BoIs business turnover comes from its international operations. The bank has 24 branches and offices abroad, including key cities such as London, New York, Paris, Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong, Nairobi, Vietnam, Shenzhan and Jakarta. It now wants to increase its international footprints to bolster business growth.

 Asked whether the bank has any immediate plan to raise its capital, Balachandran said, Our capital adequacy ratio is at 11.5 per cent. Reckoning the growth in assets and operations vis-a-vis the market risks, we do not envisage any immediate need to raise the capital base. We still have enough headroom to increase tier-II capital. We may not go the capital market immediately. 

 The governments holding in the bank is at 69 per cent at present. According to Balachandran, the bank is waiting for the RBI guidelines on issuing preference shares before it takes a decision for raising capital. 

 BoI expects to do a total business of Rs 160,000 crore during the current fiscal. The bank has shifted its investments in treasury to held-to-maturity to reduce the risk of its investment portfolio. 

 We are focussing more on money lending. The returns are better in loan assets, Balachandran said. The bank is putting more thrusts on retail lending.

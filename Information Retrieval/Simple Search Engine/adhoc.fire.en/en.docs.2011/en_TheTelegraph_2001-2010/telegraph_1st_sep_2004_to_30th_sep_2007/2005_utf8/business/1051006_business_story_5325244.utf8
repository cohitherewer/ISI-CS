 Mumbai, Oct. 5: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will soon decide if banks can issue hybrid instruments ? quasi-debt, quasi-equity ? as part of Tier I and Tier II capital. The move follows indications that the proposal allowing banks to float preference shares would be considered in the winter session of Parliament.

 Both plans are crucial for banks, particularly the nationalised ones, since they have to look at new ways to raise capital to keep pace with the robust growth in credit. 

 Many public sector banks have been hamstrung by the 51 per cent cap on government holding. With its stake in most banks near that threshold, the search for options to raise capital without diluting the Centres holding has begun.

 The announcement on hybrid instruments was made by Usha Thorat, executive director of Reserve Bank, at a summit organised by Ficci and Indian Banks Association (IBA). When it comes to hybrid varieties of Tier I, Tier II or Tier III capital, certain products are under active consideration. The list will be finalised soon.

 Thorat said allowing preference shares ? a proposal first floated by finance minister P. Chidambaram in his budget speech ? will require an amendment to the Banking Regulation Act. The issue has run into a block because of the clause in the act that requires the Centre to hold at least 51 per cent in public sector banks. There is nothing to inhibit Tier II capital growth, she added. 

 The conference saw global bankers deliberating the future of banking against the backdrop of reforms that the Basel II regime will bring in from March 2007. Some bankers moaned about the costs of compliance and the possibility that benefits from it would take time to flow in. 

 K. Cherian Varghese, chairman and managing director of Union Bank of India (UBI), highlighted some of the difficulties, one of which is the stipulation that government must own 51 per cent of public sector banks at all times. There was a need, therefore, to introduce new tools to raise capital be flexible on the issue.

 Varghese is among those bankers who want preference shares to qualify as Tier I capital. However, under Basel guidelines, these shares, with fixed tenures, cannot be part of Tier I capital. Preference shares, sans voting rights, give holders the first charge on assets.

 Union Bank is considering another public offering of around 4.5 crore shares. Varghese said the offering will bring down the governments stake to 55.45 per cent from 60.85 per cent.

 What do we do after the governments stake comes down to 51 per cent? We cannot raise resources through a rights issue. We, therefore, hope that preference capital will be reckoned as Tier I capital, Varghese said.

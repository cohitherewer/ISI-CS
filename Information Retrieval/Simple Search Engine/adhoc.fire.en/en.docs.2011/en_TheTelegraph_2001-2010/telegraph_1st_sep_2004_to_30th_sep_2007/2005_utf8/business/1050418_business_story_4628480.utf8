 Wockhardt chief sees benign drug prices

 New Delhi, April 17 (PTI): Gearing up to face the challenges of the product patent regime, Wockhardts chairman H. F. Khorakiwala has said domestic companies have invested over Rs 1,500 crore in R amp;D and are expected to come out with at least 20 new drugs in the next decade to keep the prices under control. 

 ?The domestic pharma companies have already filed 500 patents for new drugs,? he said, adding that these will help production of drugs that could be affordable for the common man. 

 He sought to allay fears that enforcement of the product patent regime under the TRIPS agreement would increase the prices of life-saving drugs. 

 Most of the bulk drugs produced by the Indian pharmaceutical companies were under the WHO essential list, which are immune to patent laws, he said. 

 Detailing achievements made by the pharma companies under the Indian Patent Act, 1970, which had allowed only process patent and not product patent, Khorakiwala said the country has a share of 22 per cent of the global generic drug market.

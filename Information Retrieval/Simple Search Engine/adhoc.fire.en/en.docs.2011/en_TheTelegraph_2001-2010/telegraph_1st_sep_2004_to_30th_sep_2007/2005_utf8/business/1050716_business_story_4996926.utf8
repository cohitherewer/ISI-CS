 General Electric earnings up 24%

 Immelt: Upbeat

 Boston, July 15 (Reuters): General Electric Co on Friday posted a 24 per cent rise in quarterly profit on strong results from its energy business, improved profitability at its plastics segment, and steady growth at its financial units.

 The earnings improvement, which was in line with Wall Street estimates, came from nearly every corner of the media, financial and industrial giants business portfolio, with all 11 operating segments posting a profit gain of more than 10 per cent.

 GE is in tremendous shape, chief executive Jeff Immelt said, adding the company has put in place initiatives to ensure it can sustain earnings growth of more than 10 per cent in 2005 and beyond.

 Net income rose to $4.65 billion, or 44 cents a share, in the second quarter, from $3.75 billion, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier. Quarterly sales rose 13 per cent to $41.56 billion from $36.78 billion last year. Orders increased 13 per cent.

 Analysts had expected GE to earn 44 cents a share before extraordinary items on revenue of $41.85 billion.

 For the full year, GE lifted the low end of its earnings per share forecast range by 2 cents to $1.80. It kept the high end unchanged at $1.83. Analysts are forecasting $1.82 a share for 2005.

 General Electric lifted the lower end of its outlook so thats a positive, but there were no major surprises in General Electrics results, said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies amp; Co.

 Finance firms can raise ECBs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 3: The government will change the rules for accessing external commercial borrowings. Non-banking financial corporations will be allowed to access foreign loans for infrastructure projects and housing finance companies can get loans through foreign currency convertible bonds.

 Financial institutions dealing exclusively with infrastructure projects or export finance such as IDFC, IL amp;FS, Power Finance, Power Trading Corp, IRCON and Exim bank will also be able to raise foreign loans on a case by case basis. 

 A finance ministry notification said, ECBs by NBFCs will be permitted under the automatic route from multilateral financial institutions, reputed regional financial institutions, official export agencies and international banks towards import of infrastructure equipment for leasing to infrastructure projects. 

 The notification said the loan should have a minimum maturity period of five years. 

 Similarly, the ministry said: Housing finance companies with strong financials satisfying criteria to be notified by the RBI will be allowed to raise foreign currency convertible bonds under the approval route. 

 Existing rules allow ECBs for a period of 3 to 5 years up to $20 million through the automatic route. Similarly those for more than five years up to $500 million are also allowed through the automatic route. For loans above these ceilings, corporates have to approach an empowered committee set up by the RBI. 

 The new phase of liberalisation of rules governing foreign loans follows a period during which the government had actually tightened the borrowing window following a surge in its forex reserves. The logic was that too much foreign exchange in Indias kitty could see the rupee appreciate to such an extent that exporters would be badly hit.

 Bajaj Hind to break into top five

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 11: Bajaj Hindusthan Ltd is aiming to become one of the five largest sugar producers in the world.

 It is investing Rs 750 crore to ramp up its cane-crushing capacity to 95,000 tonnes crushing per day by 2006-07 from the present 53,000 tonnes.

 The company will augment the capacity of both brownfield and greenfield plants.

 The Rs 750-crore investment plan has been fully funded ? around Rs 261 crore will come from GDRs, Rs 217 crore from bonds and Rs 272 crore will be generated internally.

 Earlier, Bajaj Hindusthan (BHL) had raised $110 million comprising $60 million of GDRs and $50 million zero coupon worth of foreign currency convertible bonds. 

 Kushagra Nayan Bajaj, chief executive of BHL, said the company is planning to venture into other upstream and downstream projects in the future. Though he did not divulge the sectors that are being looked upon, officials indicated that the company is considering various opportunities, including molasses, which is a by-product of the sugar industry. 

 BHL, which is focusing on Uttar Pradesh, is also open to the idea of venturing into other states.

 The company might adopt the inorganic route to retain its position as the countrys leading sugar producer.

 At present, the industry is on an up-swing with a sharp shortfall in production and a widening demand-supply gap. It presents an opportunity for BHL, which is now on the threshold of an accelerated growth phase, Bajaj said, while justifying the expansion plans.

 Construction work has started at BHLs three greenfield sugar plants in Muzaffarnagar and Bijor districts in western UP. The plants are expected to start operations in the crushing season beginning October. 

 Simultaneously, the company will enhance the brown-field capacity at its existing locations. 

 With this, BHLs total cane-crushing capacity for the season beginning October 2006 will increase to 95,000 tonnes crushing per day, which will produce around 2 million tonnes of sugar annually. Alcohol production capacity will also rise to 320 kilolitre per day (KLPD) from 160 KLPD at present.

 Bajaj said the increased capacity, which BHL is targeting to achieve by 2006-07, is more than the aggregate capacity of 24 state-owned mills in UP. 

 Due to the inordinate delay in the divestment process of the 24 mills and BHLs own on-going expansion plans, the company has decided to withdraw its bid, he added.

 Bajaj said a 0.1-per-cent increase in recovery (sugar produced from the cane crushed), which is put at over 10.52 per cent, would mean an incremental sugar output of 8,000 tonnes and an incremental turnover of Rs 14 crore. Further, one additional day of crushing would lead to an incremental turnover of Rs 11.3 crore.

 BHL has reported a 283 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 52.9 crore for the third quarter ended June compared with Rs 13.8 crore in the corresponding previous quarter. 

 The gross turnover increased 244 per cent to Rs 366.9 crore (Rs 106.7 crore). For the nine-month period, net profit increased 200 per cent to Rs 84.6 crore (Rs 28.2 crore).

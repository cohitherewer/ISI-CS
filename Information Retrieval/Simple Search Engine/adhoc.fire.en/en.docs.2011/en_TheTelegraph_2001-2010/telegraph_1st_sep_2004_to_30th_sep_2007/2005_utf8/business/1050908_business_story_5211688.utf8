 Time to let the Aston Martin grow on you

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 It?s got the look

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: Aston Martin ? the British luxury sports car that James Bond drove with such panache in Goldfinger ? is coming to India?s bumpy, potholed streets late next year.

 ?We plan to hit the Indian market in the second half of next year. We will reveal our detailed plans by the end of the current year,? said Thomas Kastgen, CEO (Middle East), Aston Martin.

 The company, which is currently owned by Ford, will launch its entire range of models here. These include the DB9, the V8 Vantage and the Vanquish S V12.

 Company officials say the DB9 will sport a price tag of approximately Rs 1.55 crore, the V8 Vantage will come for a nifty Rs 1.1 crore but the limited edition Vanquish S V12 will burn a hole in the pocket at Rs 2.45 crore. 

 The brand has already undertaken feasibility studies on the Indian market in partnership with the World Luxury Council, the international arm of the British Luxury Council Limited, Kastgen said. ?We have got absolutely positive feedback from the survey and were convinced that we want to be part of this growing market,? he said.

 Kastgen said the company was on the look out for potential partners to bring the brand to India and will first set up base in Delhi before venturing out to Mumbai.

 ?Aston Martin is in talks with a couple of entities for partnerships. What we need are people from the luxury retail market even if they are outside the auto trade,? he said.

 ?We are looking at a separate showroom along with an after sales service that could either be independent or joint with another luxury brand from another stable,? Kastgen added.

 Perilous journey

 Like James Bond, Aston Martin has lived dangerously ? almost perilously. In its proud 91-year-old history, it?s been pulled back from the brink by as many as seven white knights, each more colourful than the one before. But all of them consumed with the same burning passion for sports cars.

 Aston Martin was founded in 1914 by Lionel Martin and Robert Bamford. The company name was derived from Aston Hill ? where hillclimbing was a great motorsport -- and Lionel Martin. 

 Martin and Bamford bought premises in Chelsea and produced their first car in March 1915.Aston Martin roared and sputtered through a chequered phase between the first and second world wars as investors like Count Louis Zborowski and Lord Charnwood came and went through its gates. Lionel Martin himself left in 1925.

 But it wasn?t until Sir David Brown appeared on the scene in 1947 that some of that eternal mystique rubbed off on to the marque and soon the eponymous DB models started rolling down the ramp.

 The carmaker plunged into financial difficulties in the seventies and again in the eighties before Ford Motor Company purchased a 75 per cent stake and eventually bought it out completely in 1993 from Victor Gauntlett.

 The James Bond movies ? Goldfinger (1964), Thunderball (1965) and Golden Eye (1995) ? all featured Aston Martin models. And after a brief flirtation with Lotus, James Bond returned to the Aston Martin?s Vanquish in Die Another Day (2002). There are reports that James Bond will be driving the new AMV8 Vantage in his next adventure in 2006.

 But there?s another reason why car aficionados may fight to get behind the wheels of an Aston Martin: earlier this year, in a survey conducted by a British motor insurer, the drivers of Aston Martin were rated as people with the greatest sex appeal. 

 The mystique of the Aston Martin never dies: it just grows on you!

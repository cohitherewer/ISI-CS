 Jamshedpur, Nov. 14: Tata Motors is planning a foray into Pakistan through its subsidiary in Korea. 

 It would have made commercial sense to export vehicles from India. However, the geo-political situation does not allow the company to exploit the Pakistan market from its two plants here. 

 The company plans to supply vehicles from Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle Company, Korea, to Pakistan. 

 ?We are exploring this option,? Ravi Kant, managing director of Tata Motors, said in Jamshedpur today. He was here to inaugurate the new factory for the Novus range of trucks made with TDCV technology. 

 Tata Daewoo Commercial Vehicle (TDCV) became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tata Motors after the later acquired the commercial vehicle business of Daewoo last year. 

 With the improvement in bilateral relations, many companies are now eyeing the Pakistan market. Bajaj Auto is planning to enter the country with a joint venture for two-wheelers. 

 Tata Motors has identified China, Japan and Pakistan as three key international markets. 

 While the Pakistan strategy is being worked out, the company is exploring the Chinese conditions. 

 ?We are looking at the country for quite sometime now. There are a few options. Once there is a right fit, we will go ahead,? Kant said without giving further details. 

 Tata Motors had sold 19,598 commercial vehicles in the international market in 2004-05. This represents a growth of 78.9 per cent. 

 The company is focusing on carefully selected markets outside India. For instance, it has managed to make its presence felt in the South Africa. 

 The strong technological back-up of TDCV will help power the Indian company across new frontiers. 

 Novus launch

 Tata Motors today set rolling the manufacturing facility for the Novus range of trucks in Jamshedpur. 

 Arjun Munda, chief minister of Jharkhand, inaugurated the facility. To start with, the plant will roll out tippers and dumpers and will later go on to tractor trailors. 

 With a 300-hp engine and 25- tonne payload, Kant expects the Novus to revolutionise the Indian commercial vehicle market. 

 The one-shift production would now churn out 6,000 units with a provision for double-shifts once demand picks up. 

 ?This will find application in construction and mining sectors,? Kant pointed out. 

 Kant hopes the commercial vehicle market will remain steady despite a dip in growth rate this year. 

 ?With road development picking up again in the country, we hope the cycle of growth will be longer,? he explained. 

 In order to cater to demand from commercial as well as passenger car segment ? where it is the third largest player ? the company has chalked out a Rs 6,000-crore investment plan for the next five years.

 IT act easy on BPOs

 M. RAJENDRAN

 New Code

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: The proposed amendment to the Information Technology Act seeks to make life easy for BPOs but may end up doing more harm than good. 

 The committee reviewing the act has suggested that business process outsourcing companies and network service providers be absolved of any responsibility regarding basic security requirements.

 The committee has defined intermediaries as telecom service providers, network service providers, internet service providers, web-hosting service providers, search engines, including on-line auction sites, on-line-market places and cyber cafes. 

 However, an intermediary shall not be liable under any law for the time being in force, for any third party information, data, or link made available by him, except when the intermediary has conspired or abetted in the commission of an unlawful act.

 Since the business process outsourcing (BPO) firms too fall in this category, their responsibility has been diluted. 

 The issue of liability of network service providers came into focus with the arrest of Baazee.com chief executive officer Avnish Bajaj for sale of a sexually explicit multi-media message video clip of two Delhi students on the Bazee.com website.

 According to the existing IT Act, the network service providers are liable for third party data or information made available by them. The committee has proposed that this be done away with.

 This is a significant shift as under existing law, the onus of proof is upon the intermediary. The network service provider is presumed to be guilty unless it proves its innocence. By shifting the onus, the proposed amendments could put netizens in trouble. It will be difficult to book remedies against intermediaries if disputes arise. 

 Pavan Duggal, a cyber law expert and a senior Supreme Court lawyer, said: Providing for an intermediary protection law may decrease the comfort factor of foreign clients and affect the growth of BPOs in India.

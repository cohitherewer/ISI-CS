 Qualis makes way for Innova

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bidding adieu 

 Calcutta, Feb. 1: Toyota Kirloskar Motor today said it was pulling Qualis, its mainstay multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) in India for the past five years, off the road.

 Stepping into the vacant slot will be Innova, a lifestyle model that the company likes to call an international multi-purpose vehicle. First launched in Indonesia three months ago, it will roll out in India on February 26, two days before P. Chidambaram unveils a budget widely expected to put the auto industry in the fast lane.

 Dealers say the new vehicle will sport price tags ranging from Rs 6 to Rs 9 lakh. This would be a little higher than Qualis models, priced between Rs 5.5-8.5 lakh. 

 ?Qualis has been our mainstay in India for the past five years. It has provided the perfect platform for Toyota in India, but we feel it is time to bring in newer products that will provide better value to customers,? Toyoshima, managing director of Toyota Kirloskar Motor, said.

 Toyota?s model shuffle comes at a time when sales of multi-purpose vehicles grew at the rate of over 24 per cent last year against the 22 per cent average clocked by cars.

 ?Innova will enable Toyota Kirloskar to achieve its objectives in volumes and market share in India. The new model will be able to satisfy the requirements of MPV and passenger cars. It will offer the performance of an MPV along with comforts of a car,? a Toyota Kirloskar release said.

 Having muscled its way to the top of the MPV totem pole ever since its roll-out in January 2000, Qualis totted up first-year sales of more than 21,000 units and a market share of 35 per cent. The tally rose to 40 per cent the next year as customers drove home with 28,000 vehicles.

 Despite competition from MPVs of other automakers, Qualis? sales went up to 30,000 in 2003 and 36,700 in 2004. Awards in the areas of customer satisfaction, quality and performance matched the sales surge.

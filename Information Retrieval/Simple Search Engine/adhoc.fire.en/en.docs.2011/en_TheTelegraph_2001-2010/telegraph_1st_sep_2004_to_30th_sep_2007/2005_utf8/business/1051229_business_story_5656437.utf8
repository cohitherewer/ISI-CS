 Panel on airport rejig 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 In safe hands

 New Delhi, Dec. 28: E. Shreedharan, the brain behind the Delhi metro rail and Konkan Railway projects, will now head a new expert group formed by the government to advise it on the technical and financial nitty-gritty in the bidding process for the modernisation of Mumbai and Delhi airports.

 Cabinet secretary B.K. Chaturvedi today set up the group of technical and financial experts, which will advise the high-powered official committee headed by him on the bidding process.

 Besides Shreedharan, the panel of experts includes financial controller of Indian Railways, Sivadasan and top officials of the Airports Authority of India and directorate general of civil aviation.

 It had been alleged that the evaluation of the bids for the airport modernisation had not been properly done. The Left allies at the Centre, too, alleged that the legal advisers and merchant bankers to the bidding process were linked with Reliance, one of the two successful bidders in the disputed evaluation. 

 The new panel will first evaluate the bidding criteria and work out whether the technical and financial rating systems were fair. It will also see whether the normal rules and procedures for such bidding were followed. Airplan of Australia, which had been appointed the technical adviser, rated the bids. 

 The cabinet secretary was asked to look into the issue after the controversy surfaced at an inter-ministerial group meeting on the subject. 

 It was alleged that Reliance managed to get the highest ranking for the project bids despite its partner for the project, a Mexican airport company, did not enjoy as high reputation in the aviation world as Munich or Frankfurt airport companies enjoyed.

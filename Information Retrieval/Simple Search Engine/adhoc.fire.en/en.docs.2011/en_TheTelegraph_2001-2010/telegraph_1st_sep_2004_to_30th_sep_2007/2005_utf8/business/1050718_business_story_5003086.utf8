 Outcome budget this week

 New Delhi, July 17 (PTI): The outcome budget, which has already been delayed by a fortnight, is expected to be unveiled this week after the Planning Commission evaluates the progress of projects under various Union ministries.

 All ministries have sent their inputs to the finance ministry, which has referred them to the plan panel for evaluation, said a government official.

 It will document valuable inputs for putting in place a mechanism to measure the development of various central projects. 

 Accordingly, the finance ministry will allocate resources based on the progress of a project.

 This is the first time finance minister P. Chidambaram will present the outcome budget, which will measure the effectiveness of the money spent on various heads under different ministries.

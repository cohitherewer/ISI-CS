 Price cap smothers oil investment plans

 S. P. S. PANNU 

 Tripathi: Stock taking

 New Delhi, Aug. 19: Public sector oil marketing companies need Rs 13,500 crore to meet their capital expenditure requirements during this fiscal, petroleum secretary S.C. Tripathi has informed the Prime Ministers office.

 Sources said Indian Oil needs Rs 7,475 crore, Hindustan Petroleum Rs 2,875 crore and Bharat Petroleum requires Rs 2,500 crore. IBP, which is headed for the sick bay, needs Rs 500 crore to meet its capital expenditure requirements. 

 Senior PMO officials and Tripathi have decided to initiate measures to revive the health of the oil marketing companies and help them carry out planned investments in crucial areas, sources said. 

 Given the political compulsions of the government, the bureaucrats have been told that there can only be a moderate increase in the prices of petrol and diesel. The central levies on petroleum products will, therefore, have to be lowered in order to relieve the burden on the oil companies. 

 The PMO has asked the petroleum ministry to send details of the tax burden and the capex requirement of the oil marketing companies to the revenue secretary and the secretary of economic affairs in the finance ministry.

 Till now, the finance ministry, headed by P. Chidambaram, has been stonewalling the attempts of the petroleum ministry to get some respite for the oil companies who have to bear the crushing burden of ad valorem levies that cannot be passed on to consumers. 

 The oil marketing companies are losing Rs 92 per cylinder and Rs 11 per litre on LPG and kerosene, respectively, and are also paying excise duty on the two cooking fuels.

 With the PMO intervening, the petroleum ministry is seeing some light at the end of the tunnel in its battle with the finance ministry to restructure the distorted tax structure on petroleum products which is bleeding the public sector oil marketing companies. 

 The petroleum ministry wants a specific quantity based duty structure on petroleum products that will enable the finance ministry to meet a fixed target. However, the finance ministry which sees revenues shooting up each time the prices of crude oil and petroleum products go up wants to stick to the value based or ad valorem duty structure.

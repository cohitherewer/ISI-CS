 Steel prices to rule firm

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 24: International steel prices will remain firm over the next few years, says Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry in India. 

 Global demand for steel is growing at an annual rate of 7 per cent to 8 per cent while its production is likely to increase by less than 4 per cent, reveals a report released by the chamber.

 Burgeoning demand is expected to continue from growing economies including China, the US and Europe.

 Domestic demand is rising on the back of infrastructure development and growth in housing and construction sectors. Per capita consumption of steel has also increased following a change in the standard of living with increasing per capita income, said Assocham president M. K. Sanghi.

 Steel consumption is expected to grow in the newly independent states (NIS) of the former Soviet Union as well as in OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) economies. In addition, the Japanese economy is also expected to turn around after a prolonged recession.

 The study says a significant growth in demand for steel in India is expected because of construction activities on account of the Commonwealth Games slated for 2010. 

 Besides infrastructure and construction, sectors such as automotive and capital goods will also be key drivers for this demand growth. 

 Steel prices nonetheless will continue to hover on the higher side because of rising input costs. Besides, the growth in global steel demand is also likely to continue for some time now, said Sanghi. 

 A surge in the import cost of raw materials, such as coke and ore, will also stem the rising steel prices. The iron ore prices are expected to notch up by another $16-24 per tonne in the current fiscal, while coking coal prices are likely to fuel a hike of $52-67 per tonne of steel.

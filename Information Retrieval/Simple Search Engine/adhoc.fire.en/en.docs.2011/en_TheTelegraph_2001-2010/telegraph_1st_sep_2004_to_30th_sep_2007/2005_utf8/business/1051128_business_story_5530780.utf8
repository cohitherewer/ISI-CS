 Calcutta, Nov. 27: The Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) has shortlisted four overseas firms to become its joint venture partner for the life insurance business.

 IDBI is also partnering with IDBI Capital Market Services, its 100 per cent subsidiary, for floating an asset management company. It may also rope in another partner for the AMC. 

 Both the ventures will take shape in the next six months, said Sushil Muhnot, managing director and CEO of IDBI Capital Market. ?IDBI is carrying out a due diligence of the four overseas firms that have shown interest in joining the insurance venture.?

 He said although IDBI was entering the insurance business late, its strong network would help penetrate the market. In fact, IDBI Capital will help in marketing the insurance products.

 He added that IDBI Capital might hive off the investment banking division into a separate company in the future.

 Muhnot was here recently to launch the online investment portal, idbipaisabuilder.com, aimed at retail investors.

 IDBI, which manages Rs 32,000-crore worth of pension and provident funds, has emerged as a contender for the national pension fund manager of the government?s new pension fund.

 It has also been selected as one of the arrangers for raising Rs 3,500 crore Tier-II capital for the State Bank of India. Initially, the bank will raise Rs 1,500 crore. ?It will be raised at home and abroad,? Muhnot said. 

 The portal has tied up with news organisations like Reuters, Business Standard and Moneycontrol.com for up-to-date information, he said and added that CMIE and MyIris will provide corporate data and company-specific fundamental analysis.

 The portal facilitates online investments in equities, mutual funds and IPOs.

 Muhnot said India is currently the fastest growing economy in the world, apart from China. 

 Also, the fundamentals appear to be strong enough to sustain the rapid growth in the near future. As a result, personal income has increased and, therefore, disposable income has grown at a rapid pace.

 There has been a boom in the share markets, which has resulted in economic growth. ?Equity gives the maximum return of 18.25 per cent against other instruments like G-secs (10.64 per cent) or bank fixed-deposits (10.27 per cent),? Muhnot said.

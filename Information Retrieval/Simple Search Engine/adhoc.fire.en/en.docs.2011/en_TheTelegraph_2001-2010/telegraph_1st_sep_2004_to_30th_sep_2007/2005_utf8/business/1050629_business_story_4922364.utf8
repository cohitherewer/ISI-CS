 MMTC opposes Nilachal stake sale

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Steely resolve

 Calcutta, June 28: MMTC Ltd has opposed the divestment of its stake in Nilachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL) to Steel Authority of India (SAIL). This is likely to upset the steel ministrys grand plans to consolidate all public sector units under SAIL.

 MMTC, which is under the ministry of commerce, feels that there is no need to induct SAIL as a strategic partner in NINL, leave alone divesting its entire 49 per cent stake to it.

 MMTC, the largest trading company in the country, is also the single largest equity partner in the sponge iron unit at Dhuburi in Orissa along with the state government. 

 It has so far invested Rs 200 crore in the plant. In the first year of commercial operations, NINL has posted a net profit of Rs 105 crore over a turnover of Rs 1,132 crore.

 We have taken all the pains to develop the company and it is yielding good results. Why should we throw it away now? an MMTC source asked.

 NINL has dedicated mines having iron ore deposits of 100 million tonnes, which are yet to be developed. They make the company even more lucrative for outsiders.

 Industry sources pointed out that SAIL did not show much interest in NINL in its formative years. With the upturn in the steel sector, the public sector behemoth is taking an interest in it.

 The steel ministry is contemplating bringing all public sector companies under SAIL to increase the economy of scale. The merger of IISCO has already initiated the process. It is also considering integrating companies like RINL and NINL.

 NINL at present produces only 5 lakh tonnes of pig iron every year. In the second phase, it will manufacture billet and wire rods.

 It will invest close to Rs 800-1,000 crore for the expansion, which will be phased over the next three to four years.

 With a substantial profit in the first year of full operations, NINL will comfortably plough in internal accruals to fund the project.

 Moreover, MMTC will also play its part as the largest equity partner to support its subsidiary.

 Debt from a leading financial institution like IDBI could also be easily harnessed for funding.

 NINL could also explore the option of an initial public offering (IPO) to meet the capital expenditure requirement. 

 Therefore, NINL does not require the SAIL partnership to invest in the future expansion of the company.

 MMTC feels that it could exit from NINL, but at an appropriate time. Once the entire facility (billets and wire rod) comes on steam, the value of its stake will be appreciated much higher from the present level.

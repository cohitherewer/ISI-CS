 Profit hunters maul stocks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 23: Profit hunters overran the trading ring today, mauling market indices that have been breaking new ground and slamming brakes on a gravity-defying rally.

 The BSE sensex slumped 115 points to 9256.91 as Dalal Street turned into a sellers stopover. The key stock barometer swung a gut-wrenching 250 points in a session that was stalked fears of a year-end FII pullout. Lack of new triggers for fresh purchases also fuelled the slide.

 The 30-share index opened at 9417.29, up from Thursdays close of 9372.30, and hit a new intra-day high of 9442.98 within the first 10 minutes. Later, however, it plumbed a low of 9237.94 before ending with a fall of 1.23 per cent.

 FIIs, which have been buying shares worth Rs 384.70 crore on Wednesday and a total of Rs 8,224 crore in the 21 days of this month, were believed to be sellers in select shares today.

 That is not worrying the optimists who say there is no reason to believe that foreign funds, which have shovelled an unprecedented $10 billion this year, will lie low.

 Mutual funds have also been big buyers in the current market rally, but they have taken a more cautious line this month. Sebi figures put their sales at Rs 1848 crore.

 On the BSE, all indices ended in negative territory. The one tracking metals was the biggest loser, followed by the index that measures swings in consumer durables.

 Meanwhile, the NSE today froze all future derivative contracts in Reliance Industries shares till January 17. The move comes a day after the company fixed Jan 25 as the record date for the demerger.

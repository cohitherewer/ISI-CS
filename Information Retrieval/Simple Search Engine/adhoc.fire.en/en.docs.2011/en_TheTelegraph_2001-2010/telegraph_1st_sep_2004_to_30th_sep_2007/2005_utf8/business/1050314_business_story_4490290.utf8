 The great gambler

 Investors prefer to ride the market bronco through mutual funds. Chandralekha Tulal says when you should pull out of the fund

 Life?s a gamble: a huge throw of the dice. The sage advice that the old, whisky guzzlin, cigarette-bumming gambler gives Rogers on a train to nowhere is as good as any that a stock market adviser in a starched blue suit is going to give you. 

 The old geezer goes on: ?Now every gambler knows that the secret to survivin?/ Is knowin? what to throw away and knowin? what to keep quot;. 

 The rules of the game in gamblin applies closely to the bourses as well ? even though they may recoil at the idea of being clubbed with card sharpers and that ilk.

 Most investors today turn to mutual funds to help them navigate the treacherous shoals of the stock market: they feel that it could minimise their risks of placing their bets on the stocks themselves. But is your mutual fund serving you well? How do you know? And when is it time to dump that fund for another?

 We will talk about selling mutual funds and when to do it and why because understanding when and what to sell will make you a better buyer as well as a savvy seller.

 More often than not, you will see people offloading their funds on the basis of poor performance but it might surprise you to know that it is not necessarily the best reason to do so.

 The first thing that one needs to remember is that mutual funds are not synonymous with stocks. So, a decline in the stock market does not necessarily mean that it is time to sell the fund. Stocks are single entities driven by the ?buy low, sell high? rationale, which explains why, in a falling stock market, many investors panic and quickly dump all their stock-oriented assets. 

 Because mutual funds are diverse portfolios, relying only on market timing to sell your fund may be a useless strategy. Moreover, as funds are geared to long-term returns, a lower rate of return during the first year is not necessarily a sign to sell. 

 It is important to base the decision on relative performance and not absolute performance and a comparison should be drawn with its peers across various horizons such as one year, three years and more. If your fund has constantly under-performed the average in all cases, then it sure is one of the better reasons to exit from the fund.

 One should consider selling a fund if there is a change in ones asset allocation. As investors get closer to the time when they believe they will need their money, they typically shift their asset allocation to include more fixed income and less equity. This is an obvious time to sell one or more equity funds. One should also consider selling a fund or part of your holdings to periodically rebalance ones portfolio.

 You could also consider selling a fund if it becomes too large. The bigger the fund, the harder it is for a portfolio to move assets effectively. It is more of an issue for focused funds, which either deal with a smaller number of shares, or invest in stock that has low volume and liquidity.

 A high expense ratio could also make you consider selling your fund. 

 However, do not give a fund the axe just because of its expenses. If you find a second fund thats equally suitable for your needs, it may be time to sell the one with higher expenses.

 A change in investment style of a fund is also a reason to consider selling it. You most likely invested in a fund that accurately reflects your financial goals but if your fund manager starts investing in instruments that do not reflect the funds original goals, you may want to re- evaluate. 

 Additionally, some funds may change their names or get merged into another fund, which may reflect change in strategies. You can also consider selling a fund if the portfolio manager changes, unless it is an index fund. As a shareholder, you should learn all you can about the new managers style, philosophy and record and then take a decision.

 However, while selling your units of mutual funds, keep in mind the exit load and the taxation aspects of such sale.

 There is one thing that the investor in mutual funds can feel pretty smug about. Unlike Rogers old gambler he doesnt have to say: ?The best thing you can hope for is to die in your sleep.? But then again, six-shooters were in business when the markets tanked in 1929 sparking the Great Depression.

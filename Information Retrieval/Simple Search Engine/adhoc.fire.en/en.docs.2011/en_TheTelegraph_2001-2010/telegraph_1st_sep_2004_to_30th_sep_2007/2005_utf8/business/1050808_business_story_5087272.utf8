 Q amp;A

 Going flat out

 My husband has bought a flat during this assessment year. For 15 years we lived in another apartment, which is now lying vacant since we live in our new flat. We are trying to sell or rent out the old flat. Will my husband need to include income from the old flat in his IT returns because he owns two residential houses? 

 Lakshmi Bijoy, Calcutta

 ce the flat is lying vacant, it would be deemed as being used for self-occupation. Therefore, you are entitled to exercise an option in terms of which, the annual value of any house property as specified by you will be taken as nil. The annual value of the other self-occupied house will be determined on notional basis as if it had been let out.

 Case study

 My son is studying in a private engineering college. Can I claim tax benefit under section 80C for 2005-06 for paying Rs 25,000 towards tuition fees? 

 S. Chattopadhyay, by e-mail

 Yes, you can claim a deduction under section 80C.

 Share sale

 In June 2005, I sold certain shares, which were included in all my previous income tax returns. The sale value less the index value resulted in long-term capital gains. The broker in the contract form has deducted securities transaction tax at 0.10% on the gross sale value in addition to service tax and brokerage. Will the capital gains attract income tax? 

 B Mukherjee, by e-mail

 Tax on long-term capital gains on securities has been waived off from fiscal 2005-06. Therefore, you are not required to pay any tax. However, you are still required to show it in your returns with applicable tax rate as nil.

 Transaction tax

 My mutual fund distributor informed me that I will have to pay securities transaction tax when I sell my mutual fund units. Is it correct?

 S. N. Ganguly, Calcutta

 Yes, your distributor is correct. On any redemption of mutual fund units, you have to pay securities transaction tax at 0.15 per cent on the gross value of the transaction. However, this is applicable only for equity funds.

 Shoppers? delight

 Customers need not lose sleep over loss of debit cards, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 It?s the beginning of the month. The salary cheque has just come in and the world looked merrier. Barnali goes shopping. 

 And then it happens ? she loses her debit card at the mall. A man picks it up and buys himself a mobile phone for Rs 20,000. 

 Barnali realises her loss a day later. She makes frantic calls to the bank and gets her account de-activated. But by that time Rs 20,000 had been debited from her salary account. Unlike a credit card, the payment made on a debit card is directly debited from the cardholder?s bank account. 

 Barnali wanted to place an insurance claim on the money lost. But she was in for a surprise! Her bank did not offer ?purchase protection? on money lost on a debit card before the theft was reported. 

 Consumer protection

 In developed countries like the US, there are federal laws that limit the financial liabilities of the cardholder in case the card is lost. But in India, there are no such legal protections to credit or debit cardholders. Whatever protection is available comes as a good gesture of card issuers in offering an insurance to a limited extent to fraud purchases. And, till recently, this protection was available on credit cards only. 

 Zero liability?

 Many banks offer a ?zero liability? protection to their ATM-cum-debit cardholders against any theft or loss. 

 However, this ?zero liability? means the cardholder won?t have to make any payment for those purchases made after the loss is reported to the bank. The loss or theft must be reported within 24 hours along with a copy of the first information report (FIR) filed with a police station. Most of the banks wont even register the complaint without the FIR. 

 Good news!

 But there?s some good news for people like Barnali. Visa International, the global payment settlement service provider, has recently extended its ?zero liability? policy prevalent in the US and Canada to the Indian sub-continent. 

 It will now persuade the banks issuing Visa debit cards in India to provide an insurance cover against the financial liability arising out of theft or loss of the card. 

 ICICI Bank offers such an insurance cover on its ATM-cum-debit cards. ?A cardholder will have 30 days to let us know about a loss. For any fraudulent purchase during the intermediate period, the cardholder can make an insurance claim. An inquiry committee will look into the details of the claim, check if the cardholder has willingly delayed in informing the bank about the loss, and will settle the claim accordingly,? said an ICICI Bank official. The maximum protection available is Rs 2 lakh.

 HDFC Bank has also extended the ?zero liability? facility to its EasyShop International Debit-cum-ATM cardholders. ?Any suspicious transaction reported by a cardholder following the loss of his card after August 29 will come under this zero liability cover,? said an official in the bank?s card division. The maximum cover here is Rs 1 lakh.

 According to the ICICI Bank spokesman, it takes 10-14 working days to settle claims , while HDFC Bank makes good for the loss in five days.

 ATMs left out

 However, the fine print is that the insurance can?t be claimed for any ATM withdrawals. ?ATM transactions are done through a personal identification number, which only the cardholder is supposed to know. No claims can be made on any withdrawal from ATMs with the lost or stolen card,? he added. 

 Banks protect ATM withdrawals by deactivating the card. As of now, there are no legal bindings on the banks for protecting cardholders against frauds.

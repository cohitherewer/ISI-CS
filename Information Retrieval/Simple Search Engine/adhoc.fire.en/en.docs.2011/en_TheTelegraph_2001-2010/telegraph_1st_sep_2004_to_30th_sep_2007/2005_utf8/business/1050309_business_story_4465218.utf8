 Low wage earners left in the cold

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Calcutta, March 8: There is a lot to cheer about the new tax structure, but not for the low salaried income group.

 A closer observation will show that the removal of standard deduction will adversely affect individuals with salary income between Rs 1,00,000 and Rs 1,30,000.

 Let us consider three individuals with salary income of Rs 1,10,000, Rs 1,30,000 and Rs 1,50,000.

 Under the earlier tax structure, after standard deduction, their income was Rs 80,000, Rs 1,00,000 and Rs 1,20,000.

 For the assessment year 2005-06, the first two will be exempted from tax. However, the third person will have to pay a tax of Rs 13,000. Taking into consideration the education cess, the amount will increase to Rs 13,260.

 On the other hand, under the new structure that will be effective for the assessment year 2006-07 after the passage of the finance bill, the whole amount is taxable as there is no standard deduction. Therefore, tax liabilities of the first two individuals are Rs 1,000 and Rs 3,000 (Rs 1,020 and Rs 3,060 with education cess) respectively.

 However, as soon as the Rs 1,30,000 limit is crossed, the tax benefit from the new structure becomes apparent. 

 In contrast to a Rs 13,260 tax liability for a person with an income of Rs 1,50,000, the amount payable under the new regime is just Rs 5,000 (Rs 5,100 with education cess).

 Nevertheless, the first two individuals can make their taxable income nil under the new regime by making investments under section 80C.

 The first person will have to make an investment of Rs 10,000, while the second will have to dole out Rs 30,000 to be exempted from paying tax.

 Again, there is a major difference between investment under section 88 and section 80C for individuals with income above Rs 1,30,000.

 A person with a gross income of Rs 1,50,000 would have got a tax rebate of 20 per cent.

 It means that to save a tax amount of Rs 13,000, the third individual would have to make an investment of Rs 65,000. 

 Under section 80C, the same person will have to make an investment of Rs 50,000 to make his taxable income Rs 1 lakh, thereby reducing his tax to nil. 

 However, this impact will not be felt by people with income from business and profession as they were earlier outside the purview of the standard deduction benefit.

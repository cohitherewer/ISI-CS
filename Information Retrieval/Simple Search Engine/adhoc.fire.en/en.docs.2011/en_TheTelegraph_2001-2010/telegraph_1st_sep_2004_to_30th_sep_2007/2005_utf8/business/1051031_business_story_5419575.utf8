 Calcutta flies high in SpiceJet expansion

 New Delhi, Oct. 30: SpiceJet will make Calcutta its hub ? the second airline to do so after state-run Indian Airlines ? with daily flights to other metros.

 The low-cost airline also plans to fly from Calcutta to China and Southeast Asian cities by 2006. It will do so either on its own stream, if the government relaxes current rules on international operations, or by using other airlines entitlements.

 CPM MPs led by Nilotpal Basu, who heads the parliamentary standing committee on transport, have been lobbying the Centre to turn Calcutta into a hub for domestic and international operations, but most carriers preferred other metros. SpiceJets surprise decision should warm the cockles of these parties.

 Basu had earlier written to the Centre asking Air-India to use the city as a base for its East Asian operations, an idea which SpiceJet seems to have picked up.

 SpiceJet, owned by theKansagra family of East Africa, will base aircraft at the Dum Dum airport and launch flights from the city to various parts of the country, starting with Hyderabad and Chennai in late November and others by next year. Before this, the airline will launch a Delhi-Calcutta flight from November 6. This service will be initially based in the capital.

 Ajay Singh, CEO of the airline, said, We will initially base one Boeing 737-800 at Dum Dum out of the five we currently operate. However, once more aircraft ? about eight to 10 ? join the fleet in 2006, more will be based in the eastern city, he added.

 While SpiceJets existing hub in Delhi is the main centre at the moment, Calcutta, with cheaper options, more space at its airport and good East-West connectivity, will eventually become a bigger hub than Delhi.

 A hub is a place where aircraft are based with hangars, maintenance and overhaul facilities. It is the centre for all flights of an airline. Such hubs bring in large investments not only from the airline but also from associated service providers, besides benefiting passengers. 

 It makes sense to make Calcutta our hub. Routes out of it are lucrative, yet its skies are not yet crowded, Singh said. Most airlines have hubs at Delhi or Mumbai. Carriers that need more pick Bangalore or Chennai. 

 SpiceJet is looking at connecting Bhubaneshwar, Bangalore, Guwahati, Bagdogra, Mumbai, Nagpur and Raipur with Calcutta in the near future, said airline sources.

 Singh said SpiceJet feels the government would allow private airlines with a minimum fleet size to fly abroad, relaxing the five-year experience clause.

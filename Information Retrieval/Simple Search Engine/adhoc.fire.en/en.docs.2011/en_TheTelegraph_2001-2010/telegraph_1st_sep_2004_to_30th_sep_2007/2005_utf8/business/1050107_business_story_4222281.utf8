 Rs 200 cr for wireless planning

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 6: Union communications minister Dayanidhi Maran today launched a Rs 200-crore automated spectrum management system (ASMS) for wireless planning and coordination (WPC), a division of the department of telecommunications.

 The system has two components ? ASMS and NSMS (national spectrum monitoring system) ? and has been implemented with assistance from the World Bank. 

 Unveiling the system, Maran said the role of WPC is very crucial as its responsibility has grown within a short span of time.

 With the government aiming at 200-250 million telephone connections within the next three years, the responsibility of WPC has grown further, Maran said.

 The system has national headquarters at Sanchar Bhavan with access to field organisations across the country. The system will have a centralised data base of wireless licences, frequency records, spectrum engineering management and analysis software and digital terrain map (DTM) of the country.

 The system has features like on-line filing of application for frequency assignments and licences, electromagnetic interference (EMI) and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) analysis, frequency planning, frequency co-ordination, clearance of sites, billing and receipts, which would optimise the use of scarce spectrum resource. 

 The system will further help in faster processing of requirements.

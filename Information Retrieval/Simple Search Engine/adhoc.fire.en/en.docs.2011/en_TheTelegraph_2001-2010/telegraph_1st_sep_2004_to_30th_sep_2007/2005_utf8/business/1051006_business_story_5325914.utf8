 Tata Power MoU with Jharkhand

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, Oct. 5: Tata Power director A.J. Engineer and Jharkhand chief secretary P.P. Sharma today signed an MoU in which the former has pledged to set up a 3,000-mw thermal power plant in the state. Chief minister Arjun Munda and Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman were present when the MoU was signed.

 This is the second time Tata Power has signed an MoU for setting up a thermal power plant in the state. Three years ago it had pledged to set up a 1,000-mw unit at Chandil but the project never took off. 

 The feasibility report and the site selection of the new plant, said Engineer, was expected to be completed within the next three months as a 14-member team of experts sets out to inspect probable sites at Ramgarh, Koderma, Latehar, Maithan and Chandil. 

 The MoU also involves the private power utility in improving the capacity and performance of Tenughat and Patratu power plants.

 A beaming Munda, with Muthuraman by his side, reiterated that by November 15 the existing Jharkhand State Electricity Board would be split into four parts. 

 While the board will be retained generation, transmission and distribution of power will be handled by separate companies, he said.

 Transmission and distribution would be privatised as well, Munda added, .

 The state government and Tata Power will jointly examine the feasibility of setting up a separate company for handling the transmission business.

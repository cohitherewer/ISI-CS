 Family feuds fan rush to draw lessons

 Birla amp; Ambani: Paving the way 

 New Delhi, June 29: The head honchos of India?s family-run companies are preparing to draw lessons from the two of the biggest inheritance battles that erupted last year: the spat between the Ambani siblings and the dispute over Priyamvada Birla?s controversial will.

 The two cases present a study in contrast: Dhirubhai Ambani didn?t leave behind a will but created a complicated maze of investment companies that elder scion Mukesh Ambani argued had anointed him as the person who would call the shots within the Rs 100,000 crore Reliance group ? a position that brother Anil refused to accept.

 In the other case, Priyamvada Birla ? the wife of M. P. Birla ? left behind a controversial will in which she bequeathed the Rs 5000-crore estate to rank outsider R. S. Lodha and cut almost everyone within the Birla clan out of the inheritance.

 The Ambanis have just reached a settlement, while the Birla will case is still being fought in the courts.

 Now, the heads of India?s family-run companies are coming together to gain some deeper understanding from these cases and a myriad other issues to ensure that there is less controversy, pain and equivocation in the succession plans that they devise for their inheritors.

 As a first step, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) is getting its national family business council to work out ways to sensitise the country?s leading family-run industrialists about how to manage family differences quietly without allowing them to snowball into a cause celebr? after a raging public feud that attracts media scrutiny.

 The shoguns of Indian industry reckon that if business clans can iron out their differences in private, it will insulate the markets and investors from the wild swings in stock prices that every public utterance generates during a stormy family feud.

 ?Families need to prepare for possible separation ahead in time. The founder member should either well in advance knit family members to work and live together, or make adequate arrangements for an amicable separation,? said Arun Bharat Ram, the newly nominated chairman of the council. ?Dhirubhai Ambani didnt do this.?

 Bharat Ram reckons that the first lesson for business clans is that when differences are simmering, ?then either families should talk it over among themselves or engage an intermediary. Situations only become complicated when one tries to act through the media?.

 The CII?s family business council is expected to host a meeting in August. Corporate honchos who are expected to attend the crash course include M. V. Subbiah, executive chairman of EID Parry India Limited, R. Haresh, director of Sundaram Industries, and Vijay Sankar, director of the Sanmar group.

 Others who could participate are Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of RPG Enterprises, Madhur Bajaj, vice-chairman of Bajaj Auto Limited, Mukul Somany, joint managing director of Hindustan National Glass and Industries Limited, and Farhad Forbes, director of Forbes Marshall.

 As part of the deliberations, the council will conduct various studies and research on family-run businesses, organise a series of workshops and seminars and interact with business schools. Goenka said, ?I have not received any invitation yet from the council. Let?s see whether I participate or not.? 

 ?Family-owned businesses continue to be important in India. They need to focus on how efficiently they can manage their businesses,? he added. One theory that is gaining ground is that family members are not necessarily the best people to run the show. ?Good executives need to man businesses. Whether one likes it or not, this is the way forward,? said Bharat Ram.

 Several Indian family-run businesses have already started to hand over executive powers to professionals ? a trend that developed first in the US and is now in evidence in Europe as well. From the Fords and the Hewlett-Packards in the US to the Wallenbergs of Sweden (who used to own stakes in companies like Ericsson, Volvo and ABB), they have all chosen to leave family members out of the boardroom unless they had shown considerable merit.

 Bharat Ram believes that it is important for the founder to draw up a will to prevent unseemly family squabbles as were seen in the Ambani case and, to a lesser extent, among Manu Chhabria?s daughters. 

 ?A will is an important instrument. Just as businessmen plan to grow their businesses, it is important for them to plan for the family in terms of succession and inheritance,? said Bharat Ram.

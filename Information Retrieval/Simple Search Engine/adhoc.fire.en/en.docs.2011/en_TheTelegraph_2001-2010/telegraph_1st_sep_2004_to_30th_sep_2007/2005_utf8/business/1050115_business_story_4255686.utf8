 Bikes steal December show

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 14: For the automobile industry, the last month of the year 2004 surely belonged to the rough and the rugged. So, while the motorcycle and utility-vehicles showed a growth surge of more than 40 per cent, domestic car sales rose by 20.6 per cent.

 In December, India?s motorcycle and utility-vehicle sales surged over other industry segments, as new models and attractive discounts attracted new buyers to the market. Some analysts also ascribed the surge to low sales in December 2003 and to the improvement in the general economic atmosphere this year and an increase in rural demand.

 The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) data show that domestic motorcycle sales in December jumped by 51.62 per cent to 4,59,458 units, boosted mainly by the success of two models launched by Bajaj Auto Ltd.

 Sales of Bajaj Auto increased by 109 per cent to 1,37,713 units in December, ahead of market leader Hero Honda Motors Ltd, which recorded a 44.7 per cent rise in sales. TVS Motor Company had recorded a growth of 19.6 per cent.

 Commenting on the strong December sales, Bajaj spokesperson Ravi Kumar told The Telegraph from Pune, ?The sales surge in Bajaj has been continuing for the last couple of months. It is based mostly on market pull. Growth has come from our three main models ? Pulsar, Discover and CT100 (Discover and the low-priced Boxer CT were launched in 2004). The company is facing a difficulty in meeting the demand. The month-on-month growth is expected to continue for the coming three months.?

 ?The motorcycle industry is making a second comeback,? SIAM said in a statement, referring to the improvement over the past two years when poor farm-sector performance hurt the rural demand.

 The motorcycle industry clocked 28.04 per cent sales growth in the October-December quarter, which makes it the industry?s fastest quarterly rate in two years.

 ?Bike makers are reaping the benefits of an increasing shift in preference from scooters,? said an analyst. Bike makers added about 10 new models this year.

 Discounts and freebies like mobile phones were also used by bike makers to lure buyers. Nine companies, including the local unit of Yamaha, make about 40 bike models in India.

 Utility-vehicle sales increased by 40.7 per cent in December. Experts say this was largely due to an attractive price offer by market leader Mahindra amp; Mahindra Ltd on its Scorpio model and strong sales of the Tavera utility-vehicle from General Motors.

 Utility-vehicles have traditionally been the mainstay of rural buyers. But analysts say that a slew of new utility-vehicles, primarily being targeted at the style-conscious urban buyer to meet a multitude of needs, are boosting its growth.

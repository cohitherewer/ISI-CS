 Calcutta, Aug. 31: Sony Ericsson has integrated the Walkman brand with its mobile phone to tap the digital music player market.

 The phone has a digital music player that can store around 125 music tracks (equivalent to 12 full length CDs) on a 0.5 GB external memory stick. The memory can be expanded to 2 GB to store up to 600 songs, which translates into 2800 minutes of music.

 We conceived the Walkman strategy in February, said Sudhin Mathur, general manager (India brand) of Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications. This is the first in a series of the Walkman branded mobile phones.

 Walkman is a copyright brand of Sony.

 Around 200 million music-enabled handsets are expected to be sold next year. This is expected to treble to 600 million handsets by 2009. Mobile music is expected to churn out revenues of $14 billion in the next four years.

 Priced at Rs 24,995, the phone is targeted at the pioneer segment of mobile users who constitute around 21 per cent of the cellphone market.

 The phone comes with some pre-loaded tracks. Loading music onto the player is through a USB port using a Disk2Phone software which allows the user to load songs from a CD to a PC and into the phone player, said Mathur. The phone can also be connected to a stereo at home through the music cable or to the car speaker. One can also buy music online from the Sony website.

 The phone also allows the user to keep listening to music even on flights.

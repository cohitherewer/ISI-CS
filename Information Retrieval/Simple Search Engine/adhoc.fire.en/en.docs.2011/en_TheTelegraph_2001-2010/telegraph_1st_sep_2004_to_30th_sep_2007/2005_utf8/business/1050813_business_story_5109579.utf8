 IDFC off to a flying start

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 12: The Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) today made a sizzling debut on the bourses at Rs 49.90, a premium of 47 per cent to its offer price of Rs 34 per share.

 Buying orders continued to throng the stock, resulting in an intra-day high of Rs 72. The stock closed at Rs 69.55, a sharp premium of around 105 per cent over its offer price.

 Boosted by investors confidence, IDFC topped the BSE turnover charts on the first day of its listing. Around 11.23 crore shares changed hands, resulting in a turnover of Rs 750.07 crore.

 Block deals were also reported in the stock. While Templeton Mutual Fund has bought 1.01 crore IDFC shares at a price of Rs 64.99 apiece, another brokerage got close to 41 lakh shares at a price of Rs 67.98.

 The initial public offering, which was made in a price band of Rs 29-34 per share, was oversubscribed 37.7 times. At the offer price, the issue generated over Rs 1372 crore.

 The qualified institutional buyer (QIB) segment was over-subscribed 54.3 times with a total demand for over 10.9 billion shares. Non-institutional investors bid for over 3.4 million shares resulting in an over-subscription of 57.2 times. Retail investors had applied for over 762 million shares, which is 5.4 times the number set aside for them.

 The issue was made to raise capital to support the future growth in assets. It comprised a fresh issue of 12 crore shares and an offer for sale of 28.36 crore. Up to 50 per cent of the issue was reserved for QIBs on a discretionary basis. 

 IDFCs performance came on a day when the 30-share BSE sensex ended lower by 49 points at 7767.49 after scaling a new peak of 7861.26. The fall was because of heavy profit booking on fears of spiralling crude prices and a slowdown in the inflow of foreign funds.

 Operators and retail investors turned cautious as FIIs reported net sales of Rs 98.10 crore on Wednesday, indicating the beginning of a gradual withdrawal. FIIs have pumped in Rs 31,390 crore in this calendar year so far.

 Global oil rates had soared to above $67 a barrel in Asian trading today, putting pressure on the government to raise prices of petroleum products at home.

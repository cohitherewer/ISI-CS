 Reliance Energy gets a shock

 New Delhi, July 30 (PTI): In a major blow to Reliance Energys plans to expand its business in the power sector, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission has rejected the application of the Anil Ambani-controlled company for a transmission licence.

 Reliance Energy Transmission Ltd (RETL), a group company, had approached the power regulator last year seeking a licence to undertake construction of 20 transmission lines and 13 sub-stations in the western region, a move firmly opposed by state-run Power Grid Corporation.

 PGCIL, which is also the central transmission utility, had publicly voiced its opposition on the ground that it had already started work on the lines which are part of the western region strengthening scheme envisaging an investment of over Rs 4,700 crore.

 In its order, the CERC, while rejecting the application of RETL, divided the western region scheme into four parts. PGCIL was awarded two parts (A and D), which involved the construction of 765 kv and 400 kv lines by 2008-09, while the other two parts (B and C) are to be fully executed by private players on the basis of competitive bidding.

 PowerGrid planned to execute the project through the joint venture route with the private partner holding between 51 to 74 per cent equity. The project involved the construction of 800 circuit km of 765 kv lines, 6,300 ckm of 400 kv lines, augmentation of 17 existing sub-stations and setting up four new sub-stations. Reliance Energy, on the other hand, had proposed to implement the scheme alone. 

 As this was the first such case involving opening up the power transmission sector for private participation, the regulator had sought suggestions and comments from other stakeholders, including the power ministry, the Central Electricity Authority, the beneficiary states and PGCIL.

 While PGCIL opposed granting a licence to RETL, the CEA suggested that as the scheme entailed construction of 765 kv and 400 kv lines it would not be desirable to entrust implementation of the entire scheme to a new entrant (RETL in this case).

 The power ministry, which was asked by the commission to finalise the transmission guidelines, in its reply left the matter open-ended and fixed no timeframe for coming up with the guidelines following which the commission decided to issue the order.

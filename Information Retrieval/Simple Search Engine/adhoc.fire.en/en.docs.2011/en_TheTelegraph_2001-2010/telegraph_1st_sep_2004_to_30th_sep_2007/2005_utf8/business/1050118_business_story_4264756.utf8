 New owner for Orissa Textile

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 17: IB Enterprises of Gujarat will buy Orissa Textile Mill for Rs 23 crore.

 The Bhavnagar-based company has already deposited 14 per cent of the total amount to purchase 80 acres of land and machinery equipment of OTM. The remaining portion would be paid within 90 days, sources said.

 Orissa Textile Mill was put up for sale in May last year. Once a shining jewel in the industrial map of Orissa, the loss-making mill at Choudwar was closed in 2001, following the recommendations of the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction. 

 Later the state government decided to sell OTM and appointed a liquidator to oversee the deal. One of the oldest cotton mills in the country, OTM has assets worth Rs 22.54 crore.

 In May last year, the high court, as the custodian of the company and its creditors, put up a sale notice.

 Initially, there was no response to the court notice. In November, the high court directed the liquidator to negotiate the factory?s sale afresh. Finally four firms, including IB Enterprises, submitted offers expressing their desire to run the sick company. 

 Last week, a single-judge bench of Orissa High Court okayed the sale of OTM to IB Enterprises for a price of Rs 23 crore, the highest bidder.

 The company also submitted an affidavit before the high court, stating that it would manage the company and appoint local people where possible. Along with the affidavit, the company also submitted an earnest deposit of Rs 2.3 crore.

 OTM was set up by Biju Patnaik in 1950. The mill, which ran for over half-a-century, supported thousands of shops in the state, ensuring a steady supply of quality clothes.

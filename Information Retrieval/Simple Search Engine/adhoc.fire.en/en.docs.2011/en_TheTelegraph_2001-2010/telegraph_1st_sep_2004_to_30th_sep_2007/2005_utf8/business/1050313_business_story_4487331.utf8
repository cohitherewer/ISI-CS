 Qwest to sweeten MCI buyout deal

 Takeover target 

 Philadelphia, March 12 (Reuters): Qwest Communications International is expected to hike its $8-billion takeover offer for long-distance telephone and data services company MCI Inc., sources familiar with the situation said on Friday. 

 The new bid, which would be presented to MCIs board early next week, would value the company at more than $24.60 a share, the sources said. The bid would include more cash than Qwest?s current proposal, the sources said. 

 The new proposal will be structured to make ?MCI?s board think long and hard,? said one source who declined to be named. ?They wanted cash and protection and they?ll have both.? 

 Qwest and MCI declined to comment. 

 MCI had rejected Qwest?s previous overtures in favour of a lower $6.7-billion acquisition offer from Verizon Communications, the nation?s largest telephone company. 

 MCI, based in Ashburn, Virginia, chose Verizon in part for its solid balance sheet and strong growth prospects given its mix of wireless and local businesses. Qwest has $17 billion in debt. 

 Some large MCI shareholders have balked at the Verizon price and urged the carrier to reconsider a richer deal with Qwest. Carlos Slim, MCI?s largest shareholder and Latin America?s richest person, slammed both the Qwest and Verizon offers as too low. 

 Qwest?s new offer will keep a protection against a decline in Qwest?s stock price, one source said. The exact mix of cash, stock and dividends could not be determined. 

 The competition over MCI comes even as the long-distance telephone market continues to face shrinking revenues and increased competition. 

 Still, Verizon wants to buy MCI?s long-distance assets and gain an immediate presence in the market to provide services to large corporate customers, rather than building that business on its own.

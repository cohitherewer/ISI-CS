 Excise relief for drug makers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 23: The government today reduced the amount of excise charged on drugs and medicines by deciding that it would calculate the duty on 60 per cent of the declared retail price instead of the current practice of calculating it on 65 per cent of the marked retail price.

 The reduction came by way of an increase in the abatement level from 35 to 40 per cent on the retail price, an official release said.

 Excise duty on drugs and medicines are leviable on an ad valorem basis. Before January 8, 2005, the levy was on the basis of ex-factory transaction value.

 From January 8 onwards, the excise duty on drugs and medicines is charged on the basis of retail sale price, after providing an abatement of 35 per cent from the retail price, given the nature of dealer commissions.

 However after drug and pharma firms made presentations to North Block officials, the government today decided that the level of abatement would be increased keeping in mind the ?special nature of the industry and the presence of large number of small and medium manufacturers.?

 The government today also threatened to forfeit the facility of monthly payment of excise duty to those assessees who do not clear entire dues within a grace period of one month.

 ?It is proposed that in cases of default in payment of full dues (including interest) beyond the grace period of one month, the facility of monthly payment of duty should be forfeited for a period of two months or till the payment of all dues, whichever is earlier,? another official release said.

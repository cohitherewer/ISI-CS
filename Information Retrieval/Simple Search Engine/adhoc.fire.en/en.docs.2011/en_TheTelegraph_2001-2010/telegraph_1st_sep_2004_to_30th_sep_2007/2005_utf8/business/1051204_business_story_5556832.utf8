 He also informed the delegation led by Hooda that the company was in the process of completing three projects on a 600 acre plot allotted to Maruti by the Haryana Industrial Development Corporation at IMT, Manesar.

 Bellsonick, one of Suzukis key vendors, has shown keen interest to locate its unit within the Maruti campus at Manesar.

 Besides holding a meeting with the car maker, Hoodas team also held parleys with Suzukis vendors and other companies engaged in the business of manufacturing automotive components.

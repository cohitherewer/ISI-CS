 Raha takes soft stand

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 25: ONGC chairman Subir Raha today struck a conciliatory note saying the company would place all its submissions regarding the MoU controversy before petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar and he has full faith that the minister would take a fair decision.

 Aiyar lashed out at Raha yesterday for delaying the MoU to be signed with the government by more than six months. He also accused the ONGC boss of incorrectly recording the minutes of the board meetings. 

 We shall make our submissions on the various issues raised by the minister and we are confident that he will take a fair and objective decision on the matter. The minister is the head of the administrative ministry and ONGC is under its control, Raha said.

 He said the earlier target of 35 million tonnes for ONGCs oil production for the current fiscal was not approved by the board of directors and a new estimate of 27.8 million tonnes was fixed for the current year. 

 A senior petroleum ministry official said the controversy was not over ONGCs production target as the ministry had reconciled to the fact that its higher target was not approved by the task force of the department of public enterprises.

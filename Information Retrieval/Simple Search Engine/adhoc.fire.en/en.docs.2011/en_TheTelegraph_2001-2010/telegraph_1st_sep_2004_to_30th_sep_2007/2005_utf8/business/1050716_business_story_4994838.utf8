 Calcutta, July 15: Exim Bank hopes to raise Rs 8,000 crore and extend $1-billion line of credit to countries like West Africa, CIS, Latin America, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Russia and Central Asian Republic in the current financial year.

 ?We will raise Rs 3,600 crore in the domestic market by issuing commercial paper. The remaining Rs 4,400 crore will be raised in foreign currency.,? Exim Bank chairman T. C. Venkat Subramanian said here today.

 Last year, the bank had raised Rs 6,000 crore-Rs 3000 crore each in the domestic and foreign market.

 ?Providing a line of credit is an important tool of market access for the Indian companies. We provide a line of credit to the regional development banks of the respective countries or to specific ministries/departments. These loans are mostly government guaranteed and, therefore, recovery is assured,? said Subramanian.

 The bank will soon provide $400 million to West Africa and CIS countries for agriculture, water supply and rural electrification. Only Indian companies will be eligible to bid for these projects.

 Last year, Exim Bank had extended $1-billion line of credit to Iran ($240 million), Africa ($270 million), Sri Lanka ($160 million), Myanmar ($63 million) and Vietnam ($27 million). 

 Exim Bank is also seriously looking at film financing as one of the key areas of investments. The bank had extended loans to three companies in the entertainment industry. All three Hindi films financed by the bank, which were released in 2004-05, were box office hits both in India and abroad. ?We would like to finance films that have markets abroad,? Subramanian said.

 The capital adequacy ratio of the bank stood at 21.58 per cent on March 31, 2005. The bank had made a net profit of Rs 258 crore in 2004-05 against Rs 229 crore in the previous year.

 The bank is also trying to finance the small and medium enterprises sector in a big way.

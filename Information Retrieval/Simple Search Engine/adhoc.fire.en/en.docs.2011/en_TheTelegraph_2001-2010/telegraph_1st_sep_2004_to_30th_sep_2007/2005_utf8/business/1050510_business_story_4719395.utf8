 Piracy sting on China automaker

 Beijing, May 9 (PTI): General Motors Daewoo has sued a Chinese carmaker for allegedly copying the design of Matiz, one of its small car, and is demanding a compensation of nearly $10 million.

 The Beijing No 1 Intermediate Peoples Court said yesterday that it has accepted a lawsuit filed by GM Daewoo against Chinas Chery Automobile Company.

 GM is asking for a compensation of 80 million yuan ($9.6 million), China Daily reported. It contends that Cherys mini car, QQ copied GM Daewoos Matiz and Spark.

 Chery denies this, saying it developed QQ on its own.

 The South Korean plaintiff initially began suing the Chinese automaker in December at the Shanghai No 2 Intermediate Peoples Court.

 However, the defendant objected on jurisdiction grounds. The Supreme Peoples Court appointed the Beijing-based court to handle the case, sources in the press office of the Beijing No 1 Intermediate Peoples Court said.

 Produced by GM Daewoo, the Matiz went on the South Korean market in 1998.

 GM Daewoo authorised the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation in 2003 to produce and sell Spark on the Chinese mainland on the basis of the design and technology of Matiz. 

 GM Daewoo claimed that the Chery QQ shared a remarkably identical body structure, exterior and interior design and key components. 

 ?Chery even used a camouflaged Matiz car to pass auto tests to acquire authorisation from the government over production and sales of QQ,? the plaintiff said.

 GM Daewoo claimed the behaviour of chery had resulted in unfair competition.

 Last year, Chinese vice-minister of commerce, Zhang Zhigang said Cherys alleged infringement and unfair competitive behaviour could not be determined according to the Chinese law and evidence provided by GM Daewoo.

 The vice-director of the state intellectual property office, Zhang Qin, also said GM Daewoo failed to apply for a patent on its designs in China. 

 Thus, the technology was not protected in China according to the law.

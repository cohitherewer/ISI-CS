 Yukos sets June date for new board 

 election

 ERIN E. ARVEDLUND 

 New York, April 12: Yukos, 

 the crippled Russian oil company, has scheduled a long-postponed 

 annual meeting for June 24 to elect a new board as it braces 

 for more legal wrangles and the possible sale of its share 

 in a refinery in Lithuania. 

 On Friday, hearings are scheduled 

 to begin in Moscow Arbitration Court over two lawsuits brought 

 against Yukos by Rosneft, the state-owned oil company that 

 won the majority of Yukos?s assets in a forced government 

 auction in December to defray a $28 billion tax bill. 

 Steven M. Theede, the Yukos chief 

 executive, and Bruce Misamore, its chief financial officer, 

 and other managers fled Russia last year amid a broad Kremlin 

 attack against Yukos and its founder, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, 

 whose criminal trial is winding to a close. 

 In an interview Saturday from 

 Paris, Theede said management was ?operating in an environment 

 of great fear and an intimidation.? Even so, Theede said, 

 Yukos was in talks with the Lithuanian government about 

 a refinery there, Mazeikui Nafta, in which Yukos owns just 

 over 50 per cent. 

 Lukoil, the Russian oil producer, 

 has also expressed interest in buying the refinery, which 

 would help crude exports reach markets outside Russia. Theede 

 declined to confirm any Lukoil offer. 

 ?There?s obviously keen interest 

 in the refinery among different companies, and anything 

 we do will be done in very close coordination with the Lithuanian 

 government,? Theede said. 

 Theede declined to say if he was 

 nominated to the new board. Asked if he would attend the 

 June meeting in Moscow, he said, ?I haven?t decided yet.? 

 Yukos ended 2004 as the biggest 

 oil producer in Russia, with an average of 1.7 million barrels 

 of oil a day, up 6 per cent from 2003, Theede said. 

 But after the auction of some 

 of its assets, including its largest oil field, Yukos now 

 produces only 600,000 to 700,000 barrels a day ? a rate 

 Theede said was unlikely to grow this year. 

 Rosneft is seeking $11 billion 

 in lost revenue from Yuganskneftegas, the former Yukos unit, 

 contending that Yukos sold the crude oil at a discount. 

 Theede declined to say how Yukos would respond.

 R amp;D spend eats into Toyota net

 Tokyo, Aug. 3 (Reuters): Toyota Motor Corp. reported a surprise 9.7 per cent fall in quarterly operating profit on Wednesday on rising spending on research and new factories, but projected another year of earnings growth backed by brisk global sales and a weaker yen.

 The worlds second-biggest auto maker does not provide group-based profit forecasts, but it sounded a more bullish tone than in May, when it had simply said it expected the business year to March 2006 to match last years record profits.

 Production and sales volumes are healthy, senior managing director Takeshi Suzuki told a news conference. If exchange rates stay at current levels ... wed be looking to achieve higher revenue and profits this year.

 Riding its reputation of building reliable and reasonably priced cars, Japans top auto maker is thriving in all major markets, and raised its global sales forecast even as US rivals General Motors and Ford face earnings erosion due to heavy spending on sales incentives.

 Toyota said operating profit for the April-June first quarter totalled 405.13 billion yen ($3.64 billion). Analysts said much of the fall was due to higher R amp;D and start-up costs for numerous expansion projects aimed at satisfying swelling demand, as well as a 10 billion yen valuation loss on interest rate swaps.

 Setting those two issues aside, we would have seen a pretty nice rise, said Christopher Richter, a senior analyst at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets.

 I dont think this (result) should change the positive outlook for Toyota, he added, noting that Toyotas capital spending plans for the full-year were unchanged.

 So far this year, Toyota has opened several new factories, including in the Czech Republic, Poland and Mexico. They will be followed by more plants in China, Russia, Canada and the US state of Texas over the next few years.

 Fuelled partly by red-hot demand for its IMV (innovative international multipurpose vehicles) series of light trucks built in Thailand, Indonesia, Argentina and South Africa and exported to 140 countries, Toyota is also expanding output capacity at a number of existing plants.

 Net profit for April-June fell 6.9 per cent to 266.90 billion yen, compared with a consensus estimate of 315.78 billion yen, although revenue grew 10.5 per cent to 4.98 trillion yen.

 Toyota as a group now expects to sell 7.97 million vehicles globally in 2005/06 instead of 7.85 million, expecting better sales in the tough North American market. Toyota and domestic rivals Nissan Motor and Honda Motor look set to keep their earnings lead over GM and Ford, which are weighed down by excess inventory and sales costs.

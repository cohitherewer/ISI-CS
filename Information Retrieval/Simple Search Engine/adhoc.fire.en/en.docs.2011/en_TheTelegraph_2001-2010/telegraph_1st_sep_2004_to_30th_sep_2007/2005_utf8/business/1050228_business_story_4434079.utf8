 Jet sets issue price at Rs 1100

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Take off

 Mumbai, Feb. 27: Jet Airways 

 today announced an issue price of Rs 1100 per share for 

 its initial public offering (IPO), which was oversubscribed 

 more than 16 times.

 The upper range of the price band for bidding was Rs 1125, considered by some analysts as too high when the issue was announced. However, when it closed on February 24, those apprehensions proved to be misplaced. 

 Analysts say the move to peg the final price Rs 25 less than the higher band will help Jet endear itself to investors. ?It?s a move in the right direction,? one of them said.

 Investment bankers hope to list the share around March 14. The IPO generated a demand of 279.8 million shares ? this meant that the offer was oversold 16.2 times.

 The portion reserved for institutions, both domestic and foreign, was oversubscribed 23.7 times. Even retail investors queued up for a slice of the airline in the last few days. 

 Jet chairman Naresh Goyal said he was delighted with the enthusiastic response to the initial public offering. ?We have set the final price at Rs 1,100 despite overwhelming demand and recommendation from our advisors that we fix it at Rs 1,125. We want to build a long-term relationship with our investors and give them an opportunity to participate in the growth of our company.?

 The Jet price comes amid plans by other private airlines to take to the skies. One of them is Vijay Mallya?s Kingfisher Airlines. 

 UTV stock at Rs 130

 UTV Software Communications has fixed the issue price for its initial public offering at Rs 130 per share. ?The ipo has received over 90 per cent response at the top end of the band. So, we decided to price it at Rs 130?, CEO Ronnie Screwvala said.

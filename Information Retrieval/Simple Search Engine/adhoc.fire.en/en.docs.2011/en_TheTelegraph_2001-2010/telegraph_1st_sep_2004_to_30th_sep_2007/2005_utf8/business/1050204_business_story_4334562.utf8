 Centre takes a big hit as states get richer

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Swarup: Number game

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: The Centre will suffer a Rs 26,000-crore hit in 2005-06 as a consequence of its decision to implement in toto the recommendations of the Twelfth Finance Commission.

 The commission had proposed to raise the states? share from the central pool of taxes to 30.5 per cent from the current level of 29.5 per cent.

 ?The total fiscal implication will be approximately Rs 26,000 crore, which will be 1 per cent of the GDP,? expenditure secretary D. Swarup told reporters here today. Stating that the finance ministry was prepared to handle the huge outflow, he said adequate steps are being taken in the budget to have a lower fiscal deficit to the mandated levels spelt out in the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act.

 In a major effort to improve state finances, the finance commission had suggested debt relief by rescheduling all outstanding loans of central loans to states totalling Rs 1,28,795 crore.

 Under the scheme, the Centre will reschedule all loans with a fresh tenure of 20 years and a lower interest rate of 7.5 per cent against the current rate of 9 per cent. ?The debt relief will work out to Rs 21,276 crore in interest payments and another Rs 11,929 crore in repayments during 2005-10,? Swarup said.

 The debt relief scheme is, however, conditional. It will be applicable to states that pass fiscal responsibility and budget management legislation that prescribe annual targets with the objective of wiping out revenue deficits by 2008-09.

 ?So far, only five states ? Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh ? have enacted FRBM laws. Maharashtra has introduced a legislation,? he said. States will also benefit from a debt write-off scheme, which will, however, be linked to the amount in reduction of revenue deficit by states.

 ?The amount of debt write-off would be equal to the amount of reduction in revenue deficit in a year,? Swarup said. The fiscal deficit of states also has to be contained to the level of 2004-05.

 The debt write-off would cost the exchequer about Rs 2,000 crore in the first year. Of the Rs 26,000 crore additional expenditure of the Centre, a Rs 4,000-crore would be for interest waiver and another Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000 crore for rescheduling loans, he added.

 The Centre stands to lose Rs 15,000 crore for the increase in grants and another Rs 4,000 crore for tax revenues to be transferred to states as part of the higher devolution formula. The commission proposed a total outgo of tax to states at Rs 6,13,112 crore during 2005-10 compared with Rs 3,76,318 crore in the last five years.

 It also revised the criteria for devolution of taxes by increasing the weightage of population from 10 to 25 per cent, geographical area from 7.5 per cent to 10 per cent and tax effort from 5 per cent to 7.5 per cent.

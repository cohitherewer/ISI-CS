 Sale code for life insurers in offing

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: Have you ever been suckered into buying a life insurance policy over the phone or the Internet?

 If you have and feel cheated in some way, the insurance regulator is ready to spring to your rescue.

 The Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA) is likely to lay down guidelines on how life insurance companies sell their products through the direct marketing channel.

 Direct marketing involves selling the products through an agency, a licensed intermediary or a broker.

 As competition becomes more fierce, insurance companies are using innovative methods to flog their products.

 The flip side is that customers aren?t being told everything about the product or given proper information on the basis of which they can make informed decisions. The worst of it all is that most discussions between an agent and a client over an insurance policy is verbal and the customer doesn?t have any written evidence of the tall promises that the agent might have made while selling him a policy.

 IRDA has started receiving several complaints from insurance clients and has been sufficiently concerned about it to initiate a process to end errant practices within the industry.

 ?The most common complaint we receive from policyholders is that they were not fully explained the terms and conditions of the policy. The grievances relate to lack of transparency over how the premium was fixed, the charges incurred and the type of cover offered,? said T. K. Banerjee, IRDA member (life).

 The regulator has observed that direct marketers are selling extremely complicated policies like unit-linked products instead of plain vanilla products like a term insurance or a simple endowment product.

 The Life Insurance Council ? a body formed by the insurance regulator to examine issues relating to this area of business ? will meet tomorrow to discuss the complaints with the life insurers before deciding on a code of principles that will govern the way they sell their products.

 ?If we don?t deal with the problem immediately, it could snowball into something major in the future and we could then have reached a point of no return,? said Banerjee.

 At present, direct marketing accounts for less than 1 per cent of the total premium collections in India against 5 to10 per cent in advanced insurance markets.

 While concept of direct marketing has come under the microscope of the council, a private life insurer argues, ?There is anyway a 15-day free-look period offered by life insurance companies during the time of purchase. If a policyholder disagrees with the terms and conditions, he can get the policy cancelled without any cost incurred.?

 However, there are few forms of redressal that policyholders can resort to. Any problem pertaining to claims can be directed to the ombudsman. For everything else, a policyholder has to register his complaint with IRDA.

 If the problem is really serious, policyholders can also approach the consumer courts or a court of law.

 The insurance watchdog is hoping to deal with the problem early and set a code of conduct for all life insurers.

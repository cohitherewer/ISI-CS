The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Bottomlines bruised, oil PSUs carry the price-freeze burden

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, May 31: The bottomlines of the state-run oil marketing companies have eroded to a large extent in 2004-05 because petro prices have not been revised.

 For the fiscal ended March 31, the combined net profit of four oil PSUs ? Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL), Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) and IBP ? declined 33.5 per cent compared with the previous financial year. 

 Their combined sales, however, increased 19.11 per cent, indicating the extent to which under-recoveries in retail business has hit their bottomlines.

 IBP, the smallest and the only pure marketing company, has been the hardest hit with its profit down by 72.6 per cent.

 However, IBP also recorded highest growth in sales among all state-owned oil marketing companies (27.6 per cent).

 Devoid of any cushion of refining margin, which was the highest last year, the company lost more as it sold more, an oil industry expert said.

 The government did not allow increase in retail prices of petrol, diesel, kerosene and cooking gas since November 5, 2004, even as crude prices peaked to $60 a barrel recently. 

 IOC, BPCL and HPCL, with integrated refining operations, managed to record profit, which was substantially lower than last years figure.

 IOC profits shrunk by 30 per cent, BPCL by 43 per cent and HPCL by 33 per cent in 2004-05.

 According to an estimate, gross under-recovery by oil PSUs during 2004-05 was a staggering Rs 20,310 crore. 

 The results of the four companies would have been worse if the government had not worked out a subsidy-sharing formula with upstream players like ONGC and Gail (India) Ltd. They doled out nearly Rs 5,000 crore to marketing companies.

 Even though under-recovery from petrol and diesel is high, sale of cooking gas and kerosene hit the companies harder. IBP had pleaded with the ministry to absolve it from the sale of both the items but the plea was declined.

 New Delhi, June 13: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said India must increase the level of economic interaction with the United States. 

 Chinas economic engagement with the US is 10 times that of India. There is vast potential for increased trade and investment relations with the US. We must consider how we can realise this potential, Singh told the members of his trade and economic relations committee at its first meeting held here. 

 According to an official statement, the committee discussed issues pertaining to India ? US economic relations prior to Prime Ministers visit to Washington next month. Singh said the government must devise a medium-to-long-term strategy for Indias economic interaction with the world, with a special focus on relations with Indias neighbours and major economic partners. 

 Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia made a presentation to the committee on his recent visit to the US and on Indo-US relations. Ahluwalia also discussed the Indo-US energy dialogue.

 The Prime Minister has asked the committee to prepare a blue print to deal with the challenges and opportunities provided by the processes of globalisation. Economic relations have come to increasingly influence strategic engagement. Indias economic interaction with the world is still relatively limited and this must increase, Singh said. He also called for greater inter-ministerial dialogue and co-ordination in this context.

 The trade and economic relations committee was set up to function as a new institutional mechanism for evolving policies on economic relations with other countries.

 Briefing reporters after the two-hour meeting, Prime Ministers media adviser Sanjaya Baru quoted him as saying economic issues had become the key to international relations and there was a need for a holistic view on this.

 The Prime Minister is reported to have termed economic issues as the key to international relations and said there was a need for greater co-ordination in the government to deal with the outside world.

 The committee will coordinate preparatory work on the strategy on economic relations with Indias major economic partners, neighbours and regional economic groupings. It may commission specialised studies, suggest mechanisms for promoting economic cooperation, suggest the scope and extent of economic engagement with identified countries and examine proposals for economic coordination between India and other countries.

 Reliance LPG for Andhra homes

 Hyderabad, Dec. 28: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) will lay 700 km of gas pipeline by June 2008 in Andhra Pradesh to supply LPG to all homes and natural gas to industries.

 J. Geeta Reddy, the state industries minister, said Reliance Industries will provide the natural gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin for the domestic and industrial requirement of Andhra Pradesh before transporting the same to Jamnagar by a pipeline.

 Reliance Industries has assured us of providing gas for our power projects and domestic and industrial use, said Geeta Reddy.

 The top brass of Reliance Industries has called on chief minister Y.S. Rajaseklhar Reddy and explained the plan of action to supply the gas from the KG basin.

 P.M.S. Prasad, president (oil and gas) of Reliance Industries, and I.L. Buddhiraja, head (oil and gas) of Reliance Industries, also offered to set up a petro-chemical complex in Andhra Pradesh to set up a crude refinery and LPG plant in the state.

 The government has agreed to provide 20,000 acres sought by Reliance Industries to set up the petro chemical complex, the state industry minister said.

 Reliance Industries chief Mukesh Ambani had called on the chief minister in November to discuss ways to evacuate gas from the KG basin.

 Reliance Industries had been awarded five oil and gas exploration blocks under the fifth round of the new exploration licensing policy. Reliance is betting big on the deep sea blocks. It had bagged four out of the six blocks on offer in this region. Three of these are in the eastern offshore KG basin, while one is in the Mahanadi basin.

 Reliance Industries also wants to build a cross-country pipeline connecting Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh to Uran in Maharastra to transport the gas from the KG basin. 

 The 956-kilometre pipeline will conduit gas from the east-coast to the western market. Punj Lloyd, with its forte in pipeline construction, has evinced interest in building some parts of the network.

 The total cost of construction of the project has been estimated at Rs 2,200 crore and Punj Lloyd is hoping to bag the contract for a sizeable part of it. 

 We are in parleys with Reliance for the project, said V.K. Kaushik, joint managing director and chief operating officer of Punj Lloyd. 

 Reliance Industries is expected to award the contract by June next year so that the work can start just after the monsoon.

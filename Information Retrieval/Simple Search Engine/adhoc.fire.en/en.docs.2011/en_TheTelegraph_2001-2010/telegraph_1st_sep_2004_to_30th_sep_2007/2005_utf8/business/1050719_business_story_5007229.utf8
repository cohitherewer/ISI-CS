 Supreme Court spikes Trai plea

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 18: The Supreme Court today declined to stay an order of the Telecom Dispute Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) restricting Trais powers to change agreements between service providers.

 Justices H. K. Sema and B. N. Srikrishna said Trai could not be given any interim relief on its appeal against the tribunal. 

 Trai counsel G. L. Sanghi argued that the stay was required because the order was causing a lot of damage to consumers, public interest and telecom services.

 On April 27, TDSAT had ruled while hearing a BSNL petition that Trai had no authority to interfere in the inter-connectivity pacts reached between telecom operators.

 Trai argued that it needed the power to make changes because the dominant telecom service providers tended to dictate terms to their smaller competitors.

 Ruias buy out Max in Hutch-Essar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Singh: Good deal

 Mumbai, Oct. 18: Analjit Singhs Max Telecom Ventures today sold its 3.16 per cent stake to the Ruias, whose Essar Teleholdings Limited signed the share deal.

 The stake changed hands at Rs 607, a price that leads to a valuation of Rs 20,791 crore for Hutch-Essar. That makes the firm the third-largest GSM operator, after Bharti and BSNL. 

 Analysts believe Analjit has reaped a handsome price for his residual stake, something he held for more than five years since he sold much of his holding to Hutchison Whampoa. 

 Analjit, the brother of Ranbaxy founder Parvinder Singh, branched out to set up his own mobile telephony enterprise at a time when cellular services had just been opened up by the government to private participation.

 The acquisition is part of our decision to enhance our stake in the consolidated entity and reflects the strong relationship between Essar and Hutch, said Vikash Saraf, chief executive of Essar Teleholdings, whose stake will rise to 33.58 per cent from 30.42 per cent.

 For Analjit, money received from the share sale can take care of Max New York Lifes needs in the initial years of its growth in India. He also has ambitious plans to ramp up Max Indias healthcare business, which, too, needs a lot of cash to attain the right size and scale.

 Essar Teleholdings is part of the Essar Group, one of the countrys largest corporate houses with interests in steel, shipping, power, oil, telecom, BPO and constructions. It has an asset base of over Rs 20,000 crore. 

 Analysts say the sellout by Max is part of the move to facilitate the initial public offering of Hutchison-Essar. Hutch-Essar recently acquired BPL Mobile Communications (BPL Mumbai), BPL Mobile Cellular Limited (BPL Cellular) and Essar Spacetel Limited (Essar Spacetel) for a consideration of $1.5 billion.

 Ascendas to fund infotech park

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 16: Singapore-based Ascendas has set up a Rs 1000-crore India IT Parks Fund to provide a vehicle for real estate investors to develop IT-related infrastructure in the country.

 The private real estate fund, focused on matured income-producing assets with development potential, is expected to eventually grow to Rs 2,000 crore in size, Ascendas said in a statement.

 As part of the fund, Ascendas is injecting two choice assets ? the International Tech Park in Bangalore, which it has developed, and the Vanenburg IT Park. The Vanenburg park, which was acquired recently, would be rebranded.

 The fund is constituted in Singapore as a private trust. The fund is targeting business parks for the IT and ITeS industry, which is a high-growth sector in the country, the statement said.

 The fund has a term of seven years and is managed by Ascendas. Ascendas holds 30 per cent stake in the fund and the remaining 70 per cent is with institutional investors including, GE Commercial Finance Real Estate.

 The business space solutions provider is working on two new projects in Pune and Calcutta. The company is planning to expand in these two cities after Bangalore, Chennai and Hyderabad. It also plans to start work on the additional 40,000 sq ft space at the International Tech Park in Bangalore.

 The Bengal government has allotted a 20-acre plot to the company at Rajarhat, which is yet to be handed over to it, said sources in the state IT ministry. Ascendas plans to set up a IT Park with 2-million sq ft of built-up space. The project is estimated to cost Rs 400 crore and will start within six months of the company acquiring possession of the land. Meanwhile, designs for the project are being finalised, sources said. The company is also working on a similar project in Pune.

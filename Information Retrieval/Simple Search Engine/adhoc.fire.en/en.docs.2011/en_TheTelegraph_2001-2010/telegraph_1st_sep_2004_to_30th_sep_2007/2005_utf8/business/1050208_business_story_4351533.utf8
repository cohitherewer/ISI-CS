The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Sellers? day out in the market

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 7: The government?s forecast of a 6.9 per cent growth for this financial year appeared lost on the markets, where the sensex snapped its long spell of gains with an 83-point slide that took it to 6535.17 at close.

 The losses were blamed on profit hunters, who stepped up their sales in the last 30 minutes of trading. The index was in a wobble early on but the seemingly healthy correction soon turned into a full-scale selloff later.

 Even data from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) showing infusion by foreign institutional investors at Rs 249.60 crore on Friday did little to rein in sellers. Some said the numbers were not encouraging since they represented a fall from Rs 489 crore on Thursday.

 Some brokers, however, saw this as a cool-off before a stronger pre-budget rally usually seen this time every year. ?The sharp gains that we saw recently were part of a pre-budget rally. However, it came early. That?s why the market is correcting now. It should look up again soon as the undercurrent is still strong,? a broker pointed out.

 The slide on bourses was mirrored in the forex market as the rupee slunk to 43.51 against the dollar. Market watchers said it is possible the fall affected FII inflows.

 Back on Dalal Street, Infosys, Lever and RIL were among the shares that hastened the sensex slide. Infosys shed Rs 51.40 at Rs 2,029.30 on reports it was deferring a much-awaited ADS ? denials later in the day did not help much.

 The Lever stock was the victim of investor jitters ahead of its quarterly results, which are due on Friday. The stock share ended with a decline of Rs 3.60 at Rs 162.15.

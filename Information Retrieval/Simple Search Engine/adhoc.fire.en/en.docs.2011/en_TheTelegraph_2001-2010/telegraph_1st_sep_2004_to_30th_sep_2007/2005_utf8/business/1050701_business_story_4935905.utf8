 Calcutta, June 30: The roadmap to integrate McLeod Russel and Williamson Tea Assam, which will be ready by October, will pave the way for manpower reduction.

 A portion of the managerial staff may be asked to leave. Together, the companies have a managerial strength of 250.

 The Khaitans will offer a voluntary retirement scheme to them. However, the 50,000 people working in the gardens will not lose their jobs.

 McLeod Russel managing director Aditya Khaitan said, ?We are taking over the control of Williamson Tea. We will review the performance of the managerial staff. The good ones will be retained and others will be offered a VRS.?

 The operational integration may also see a merger of the two companies. ?We do not rule out merger of the two companies. We are waiting for the roadmap,? McLeod Russel vice-chairman Deepak Khaitan said.

 Deepak said ICICI Bank has funded the takeover of Williamson Tea. The bank has provided an external commercial loan of Rs 169 crore to McLeod Russel for the buyout. ?It is a long-term loan,? he added. Financial closure will be over by July.

 The company has received an approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to list on the bourses. The shares are expected to get listed in the next seven to 10 days.

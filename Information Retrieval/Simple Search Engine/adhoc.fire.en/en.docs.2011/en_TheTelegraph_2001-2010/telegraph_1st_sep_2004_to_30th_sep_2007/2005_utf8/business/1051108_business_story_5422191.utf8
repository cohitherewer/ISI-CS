 Neptune to tap freight transport potential

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 7: The Singapore-based Neptune Orient Lines group (NOL) is planning to ramp up its presence in India as the government relaxes regulations on freight transportation. Apart from moving containers by rail, the cargo transportation and logistics company intends to set up more container terminals and establish intermodal and container depots (ICDs). 

 While moving container by rail is now the monopoly of Container Corporation of India (Concor), the government has already announced that this exclusivity will be lifted this year. The NOL group, which is represented by APL, a container transportation company, and APL Logistics that provides integrated supply chain services, is eager to tap the potential emerging from this development. Industry analysts said it is not the NOL group alone that is awaiting broader details from the government. Several companies at home and abroad are examining a series of options in this sector.

 According to a research report prepared by Drewry Shipping Consultants for the NOL group, while Concors rail volumes have posted continuous growth since the early 1990s, it now moves more than 1.3 million 20-foot equivalents (TEU) of international containers a year. 

 Given that the total throughput of Indias ports in 2004 was 4.39 million TEU, this will indicate that almost 30 per cent of the countrys container trade undergoes a rail move, which is a very high share indeed, the report adds, indicating the huge potential awaiting in this segment. 

 The report has also said India risks missing out on an additional 1-2 per cent of the annual GDP growth led by its emerging manufacturing sector unless the country can improve transport connections to meet the just-in-time requirements of complex international supply chains.

 Kenneth Glenn, senior vice-president, South Asia, and managing director, India, of NOL, said the country has been identified as one of the core regions in the groups global operations. 

 We have earmarked expansions in India, but not set any dollar figures, he said.

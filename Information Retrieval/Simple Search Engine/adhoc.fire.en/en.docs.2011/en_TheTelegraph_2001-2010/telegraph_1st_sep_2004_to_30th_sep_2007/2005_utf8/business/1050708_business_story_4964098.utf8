 Tea wages linked to performance

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, July 7: A majority of the Indian Tea Association (ITA) members have decided to introduce performance-linked incentives for workers in north Bengal, even though a strike has been called from July 11.

 The performance-linked incentive forms part of the wage revision, which is due since 2003. The wages were last revised in 1999. Currently, the workers earn a daily wage of Rs 45.90.

 However, a section of the producers have agreed to revise the wages unconditionally. ITA chairman C. K. Dhanuka said, ?Nearly 20 per cent of our members have agreed to revise the wages unconditionally. These members do not pay the provident fund and other statutory dues. They can commit anything. The unions, too, are free to settle the matter independently.

 China makes oil turf slippery for Aiyar

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Smooth drive?

 New Delhi, Nov. 23: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyars oil diplomacy will be put to test tomorrow as the Asian buyer-seller meet gets underway in the capital. 

 While Russia has sent a high-profile delegation led by the countrys energy minister for the meeting, the Chinese response appears to be lukewarm with their ambassador doubling as the chief of the delegation.

 During the meeting, which is a brainchild of the petroleum minister, Indian Oil Corporation and ONGC-Videsh will hold bilateral talks with senior officials from oil companies of Kazhakstan, Russia, South Korea, Japan and Azerbaijan. 

 As part of his oil diplomacy, Aiyar is keen on developing a co-operation between India and China as the two countries end up competing with each other far too often for overseas oil and gas assets. 

 The $4.2-billion Petro-Kazakh deal, which China National Petroleum Corporation literally snatched from OVL after putting in a second bid, is still rankling with the Indian oil major. 

 Similarly, China had pipped India at the post in Angola as well. Although there have been instances where OVL has outbid Chinese companies, the competition invariably leads to a costlier deal. 

 However, China seems to be not willing to play ball for the moment. Chinese companies with deeper pockets have become even more ambitious as was reflected in their bid to take over US oil major Unocal.

 Aiyar will hold bilateral talks with the Chinese delegation where his diplomatic skills will be put to a stiff test. 

 The Russians, however, appear to be keen on the Indian hydrocarbon sector. It had played a crucial role in ONGCs discovery of Mumbai High even as Western multinationals attempted to lead India astray.

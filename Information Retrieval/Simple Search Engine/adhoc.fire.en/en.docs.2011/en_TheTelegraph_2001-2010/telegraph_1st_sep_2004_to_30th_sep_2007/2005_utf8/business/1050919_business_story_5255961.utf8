 Service with a cost

 Most banks are ripping off their customers with high user charges, says Srikumar Banerjee

 Want to include your spouses name in your existing savings bank account? Pay Rs 25. 

 What?s more, banks levy the same charge if you want to drop a name from a jointly-held account.

 Even the plastic card that the bank gives you ? and urges you to use to withdraw cash from its 24x7 automated teller machines (ATMs) so that it takes some of the pressure off its tellers ? doesnt always come free of cost.

 Exhausted your cheque book? The bank issues you a new one against a charge of Rs 2 per leaf!

 There are a lot of other service charges that banks dont explicitly tell their customers, but debit directly from their account. 

 A customer learns about these hidden costs when one reconciles the account statement. But by then, the charges are all debited from the account. 

 Rajani Sarkar, 48, a marketing executive with a private healthcare company, was in for a shock when she saw that her banker, a leading private sector bank of the country, has deducted Rs 75 when she reordered a cheque book.

 Kamal Sarkar, 38, owner of a small cybercafe, was aghast with his bank?s ?policy? of charging a fee for every service it provides that he finally decided to close his account with the bank. Ask around and you will find bank customers who will recount similar experiences.

 RBI frowns

 The hidden costs in banking has reached such proportions that the Reserve Bank of India took a serious note of the practice in its Annual Policy for 2005-06.

 Deliberating on the issue over four pages in the policy paper, the central bank stressed the need to monitor the cost of banking services to assess whether there was any denial, implicit or explicit, of basic banking services to the common man. 

 The bank referred to the findings of the SS Tarapore committee on ?Banking Operations: deposit accounts and other facilities relating to individuals?, which observed that ?the banks? offerings are generally opaque ? what is not charged is mentioned but what is charged is not mentioned. High hidden costs appear rampant and unjustified, thus banks enjoy undue enrichment?.

 Good old days 

 ?But this was not the case before 1990 when the Indian banking sector was opened to private players,? said N. N. Chakravortty, a recently retired regional manager of Uco Bank. 

 ?In fact, there were no uniformity in service charges among public sector banks ?some used to levy charges on some service, others used to charge for some others. When the private sector banks came, they picked the public sector banks on their poor quality of services. 

 ?There are only the RBI and Indian Banks? Association?s guidelines on good banking practices and no clearcut direction as to how much a bank should charge for a particular service. 

 ?The tech-heavy private banks started offering better services but attached a cost to every service they rendered. Soon, the public sector banks started charging a fee for several services that they used to offer free of cost earlier.?

 Private-public divide

 However, there is a huge gulf in service charges between public sector and private banks with the latter charging far more. 

 ?Besides other services, the minimum balance clause of the private sector banks itself imposes a significant cost on customers, not to speak about the interest foregone on the large balance that they are required to maintain in the account,? Chakravortty said.

 The minimum balance for running a savings account with a private sector bank is Rs 5,000 on an average in a quarter. If the actual balance falls below the minimum, the bank deducts Rs 750 every quarter. In a public sector bank, the minimum balance required is Rs 1000 and the service charge for lower than minimum balance is Rs 20 per annum only. 

 Still trailing

 However, there is no denying that in terms of service quality, public sector banks are still way behind the private sector banks.

 But when each and every public sector bank in the country these days is offering single-window counters for all banking transactions, implementing core banking solutions, installing automated teller machines at almost every town in the country and becoming more customer-friendly, then its worth weighing the costs of the banking services that one needs.

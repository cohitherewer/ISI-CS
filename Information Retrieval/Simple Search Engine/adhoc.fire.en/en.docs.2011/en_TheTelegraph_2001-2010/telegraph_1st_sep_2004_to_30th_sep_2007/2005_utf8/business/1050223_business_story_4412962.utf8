 Heineken uncorks sales recast after profit drop

 Renewed vigour

 Amsterdam, Feb. 22 (Reuters): Heineken unveiled a new marketing drive and fresh cost cuts on Tuesday after 2004 net profit fell by a third and the Dutch brewer predicted a further decline this year. 

 The net profit missed market expectations, coming in at 537 million euros ($701 million) compared with a median forecast of 679.5 million euros in a Reuters poll of 24 analysts. Forecasts ranged from 486 million to 799 million.

 Heineken shares fell 1.5 per cent to 25.97 euros by 1006 GMT, underperforming the DJ Stoxx Food and Beverages index, which was down 0.4 percent. 

 The world?s number four brewer by volume and second-biggest beer importer in the United States said earnings were down due to continued sluggish sales in key markets, dollar weakness against the euro and a goodwill charge for an underperforming Brazilian brewery, Cervejarias Kaiser. Heineken said it would invest 100 million euros this year in marketing campaigns in the United States and western Europe, bringing total capital expenditure to 850 million. It will seek savings to reduce its cost base in western Europe by at least 50 million euros by 2007. 

 The brewer will review its brand portfolio in western Europe, but chief financial officer Rene Hooft Graafland declined to say at a news conference how many of its 90 brands would be cut and said there was no specific target. 

 The cost savings could include further closures of breweries after six sites were shut in 2004. 

 Chief executive Thony Ruys said the marketing spending aimed to ?turn up the heat? and boost the companys position in the premium beer market. This includes new commercials with actor Brad Pitt, new packaging and other initiatives. 

 Heineken raised its dividend by 25 per cent to 0.40 euros per share, but said that with the so-called organic net profit growth not exceeding mid-single digits, the lower dollar and additional marketing spending may result in a lower 2005 net profit overall, before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation. 

 Operating profit rose 2.1 per cent to 1.25 billion euros, against an expectation of 1.3 billion euros, while net profit before exceptional items and amortisation (BEIA) was 1.9 per cent lower at 791 million euros, ahead of the consensus forecast of 754 million euros.

 Oracle model to store data

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, June 26: Oracle India has created a model for a networked data hub that will serve as a single source of information regarding a person for different government departments.

 The citizen data hub will provide all information relating to a person to the different government departments and public utility services. Once operational, this hub will house citizen data from different government bodies like the transport office, water boards, electricity boards, income tax department, police records, land records and public distribution system. 

 For example, the income tax departments data regarding name, address, permanent account number (PAN), annual income, tax paid, refund claimed can be clubbed with the electricity service providers data on consumer name, number and record of bills paid.

 This will provide a unique identity to the citizens and allow them to access and track the current position of an application made for a particular service.

 State governments can also use this data to provide other services and transact with the people, Oracle India senior director S. P. S. Grover said. For the citizens, the data hub offers 24x7 access to check the status of their service requests and act as a single point of interaction with the state.

 The product could also be used by large organisations to create a repository of employee information and help manage its human resources better.

 Grover said, The data hub is a concept developed by the Oracle-HP e-governance centre of excellence. The hub will create a unified repository of citizen information by integrating and managing information from various departments. This involves not only managing duplicate data but also using geographical attributes.

 We are already testing the product prototype with certain government bodies and expect to start work on a project in the next 4-5 months, added Grover.

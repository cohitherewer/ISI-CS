 Coal puzzle in Tatas? Bangladesh equation

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 22: The Tatas have scaled up the amount they plan to invest in Bangladesh by $500 million to $2.5 billion and tweaked proposals in a way that allows them to use coal as feedstock instead of natural gas.

 Three Tata firms wrote to exchanges today, saying an update on the investment plan was filed with Bangladesh?s board of investment on Wednesday. Tata Chemicals plans a one million tonne urea factory, Tata Steel a 2.4-million tonne steel unit and Tata Power a 1,000-MW power plant. 

 Reports suggest S. Manzur Hossain, the Tata representative in that country, met the chief of the board of investment to hand over the feasibility study, which started in December last year, two months after group chief Ratan Tata made a trip to test the waters there.

 The move to look at coal as feedstock is a major shift in strategy since Tata had expressed satisfaction at the Bangla energy minister?s assurance about smooth availability of natural gas to run plants for 20 to 25 years.

 It is not clear why this option has been mentioned by the Tatas, who could have tapped Bangladesh?s 15.33 trillion cubic feet of proven and recoverable gas reserves. 

 ?These are large, complex and pioneering projects, of which many facets still need to be developed. One is the government?s request that we consider coal as an alternative feedstock to gas,? the Tatas said in a statement today.

 Despite the changes, Hossain said work on the Tata ventures should start in December. ?If implemented this will be highest investment by the Tatas outside India.? 

 The Tatas now wish to start talks with the Bangladesh government and its agencies to tie up gas and coal supplies, build infrastructure linkages, secure fiscal incentives and frame important contractual terms.

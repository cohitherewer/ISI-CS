The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Building Big

 Just try this out for numbers. A housing complex spread across 100 acres, nearly 4,000 dwelling units in various sizes, a mini township within New Town, Rajarhat. That?s what upcountry real estate company Unitech is bringing to Calcutta?s brick-and-mortar matrix, a project that promises to raise the bar with its scale and detailing.

 The master layout for the single largest cluster of residential stock in Calcutta, to be developed by Bengal Unitech Universal Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, is in the ?final stages of conceptualisation?.

 Bengal Unitech is a joint sector company in partnership with Hidco, the nodal development authority for the township, and the state government. The company has already frozen the master plan for a 50-acre integrated infotech park in New Town.

 To be developed in phases, the total built-up space anticipated in the residential complex is over 8 million sq ft. The project has been designed by the Hong Kong office of internationally-famous architects and master planners RMJM, which has under its belt such landmark projects like the William Gates Building, University of Cambridge, Tron Theatre in Glasgow and the Scottish parliament.

 The development will have an equal mix of ?high-quality housing in both high-rise and low-rise formats?, with a large clubhouse and retail trade facilities.

 ?The project will comprise amenities and facilities that would establish a new paradigm in living and habitat,? said Ajay Chandra, director, Unitech.

 Construction is expected to begin around September and the first inhabitants can move in about two-and-a-half years after Phase I starts. 

 The ?vast experience of Unitech in conceptualising and developing world-class IT parks and top-of-the-line residential projects in Delhi and the National Capital Region would drive delivery in these projects?, Chandra added.

 He promised that the mammoth residential development will be sensitive to local needs, while at the same time incorporating international best practices and latest technologies.

 Unitech has engaged traffic circulation experts, MVA Consulting of Hong Kong, to design the vehicular movement pattern inside and around its New Town projects in conjunction with Hidco.

 The IT park, for which ground-breaking is set to commence in June, will house 4 million sq ft of ?smart, contemporary, energy-efficient, world-class office space?, said Sameer Bahri, head, eastern region, Bengal Unitech.

 A central boulevard, waterbodies, illuminated fountains and landscaped sit-outs have also been incorporated in the master layout to provide a ?soothing ambience required in high-stress jobs?.

 To be constructed in five phases, the IT park, located next to the proposed central business district with some retail activity on the lower levels and a star business hotel on campus, is poised to become the heart of IT development in New Town.

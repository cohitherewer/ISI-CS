 ITC settlement sparks row

 Chidambaram: Tough stand

 New Delhi, May 2: Parliament was rocked by veiled allegations that the UPA government had struck a deal with ITC Ltd and dropped its demand for Rs 453 crore in excise arrears from the tobacco giant.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram, however, hit back hard by arguing that the compromise deal was reached when the government realised there was no point in pressing ahead with a case that could have dragged on for years.

 The excise case against ITC dates back to 1987.

 Chidambaram said the government had at least managed to avoid a refund of the Rs 350 crore that ITC had deposited with the government while fighting the case. 

 He said two senior NDA leaders had lobbied with the government to withdraw the ordinance issued in January to force ITC to pay the arrears.

 Last September, the Supreme Court had ruled against the government in the excise arrears case and the revision appeal filed by the state had also been rejected.

 The ordinance, Chidambaram said, was a ploy to ensure the government did not have to pay back the Rs 350-crore deposit.

 ?Two very respected NDA leaders had written to the government that the ordinance was unjust and ought to be withdrawn. Had we acted on their advice, we would have lost Rs 350 crore,? Chidambaram said.

 Left and Congress MPs promptly demanded the two leaders be named much to the discomfort of the Opposition, which earlier had attacked the tax deal. The issue arose after the government struck a deal with ITC last month on closing the Rs 803-crore excise evasion case against it. 

 The government?s charge against ITC was that it had colluded with retailers in selling cigarettes at a price higher than that printed on the package and thus cheated the state of revenues. Raids on ITC offices had unearthed documents which seemed to support the governments case.

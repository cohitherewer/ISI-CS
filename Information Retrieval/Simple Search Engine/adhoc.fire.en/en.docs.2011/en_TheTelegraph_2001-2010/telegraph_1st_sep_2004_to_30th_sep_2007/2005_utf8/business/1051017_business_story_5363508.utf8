 Maran sets pace for e-governance leap

 Maran: Strict stance

 New Delhi, Oct. 16: The Union minister for communications and information technology, Dayanidhi Maran, has pulled up the department of information technology (DiT) for slow progress in implementing the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) and has asked it to come out with a framework by year-end to expedite the scheme.

 The NeGP seeks to create institutional mechanisms for information technology-based governance that can be followed by the state governments. 

 Consequently, an apex body has been constituted under the chairmanship of the DiT secretary. Other members include senior representatives from the government, the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) and the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). DiT director (e-Governance) is the convenor of the apex body.

 The committee has been given the mandate to approve, notify and enforce the standards formulated by various working groups. It will also certify whether such standards are in line with international practices. 

 Maran had recently asked the DiT to give necessary impetus to NeGP and suggested that, if necessary, more private players could be involved in the process. 

 The plan also envisages setting up basic infrastructure and framing policies to implement e-governance practices. 

 The plan includes a number of mission-mode projects at the Center, state and integrated service levels. Such an effort will help create a citizen-centric and business-centric environment for governance. 

 Under the NeGP, e-governance standards are critical to ensure integration and interoperability of data and applications. 

 The department had constituted a core group on standards to put in place an institutional mechanism and processes and recommend key areas for standardisation. Some of the areas that have been identified for standardisation are technical standards, localisation standards, quality and documentation, security standards, and data standards for various application domains.

 The National Informatics Centre has been asked to prepare a white paper that would serve as a discussion paper for working groups to develop the standards.

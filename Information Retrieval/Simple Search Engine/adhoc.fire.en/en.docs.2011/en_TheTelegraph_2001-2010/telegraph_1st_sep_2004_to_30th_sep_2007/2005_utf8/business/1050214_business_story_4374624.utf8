The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Q amp;A

 My wife has investment in the Varistha Pension scheme. Can she now invest in the senior citizen savings scheme and up to what amount?

 Salil K Banerjee, Calcutta

 Yes, she can invest in the scheme and the maximum investment limit in the scheme is Rs 15 lakh.

 Tax token

 What are the deductions available under chapter VI A of Income Tax?

 Mukti Luitel, Tezpur, Assam

 Chapter VI A consists of various deductions for investment in pension plan, medical insurance premium, expenses for medical treatment, repayment of education loan, donations for charitable purpose and other eligible schemes, rent for accommodation and interest received on specific investments. Certain other deductions are also available under the chapter.

 Dividend dilemma

 I have invested Rs 10,000 in UTI Mastershare at different times at the applicable NAVs. Shall I be entitled to the same amount of dividend declared by the fund house every year?

 Dilip Kumar Dutta, Dibrugarh, Assam

 Dividend is declared on the face value of the mutual fund units, which is Rs 10. For example, if a fund declares a dividend of 40 per cent, it means a dividend of Rs 4 per unit. Since you bought the units at different NAVs, the number of units you will receive each time shall be different. Thus, the quantum of dividend received by you on each investment shall be different.

 Lost and found

 I have suffered some loss on house property. Shall the amount be deducted from my total income for the purpose of calculating tax rebate under section 88?

 P. Ghosh, Durgapur

 Rebate is allowed on the tax calculated on the total income of an individual. The total income constitutes income and loss under all the heads of income tax. Thus, your loss on house property shall be taken into consideration while calculating your total income.

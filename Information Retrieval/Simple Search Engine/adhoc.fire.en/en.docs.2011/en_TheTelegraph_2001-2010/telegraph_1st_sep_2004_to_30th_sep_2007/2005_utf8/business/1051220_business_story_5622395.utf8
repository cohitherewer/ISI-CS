 Sebi heat on DSQ Biotech 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 19: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has barred DSQ Biotech from the capital market till April 2008.

 DSQ Biotech was banned from the market by an earlier Sebi order in April 2003. Recently, the Securities and Appellate Tribunal (SAT) asked the regulator to hear DSQ Biotechs case and pass appropriate orders. 

 DSQB, earlier known as Usha-Te Biotech Industries, was taken over by the DSQ management in April 1994. Subsequently, DSQ came out with a rights issue, which opened on July 7, 1995 and closed on August 8, 1995.

 Sebi said the price of DSQBs scrip rose from Rs 20 in June 1994 to Rs 92 in September 1994. Again in 1995, the scrip moved up from Rs 37 in July to Rs 112 by the end of November.

 Sebi started tracking the price movements after receiving complaints of price manipulation and insider trading in the scrip. 

 It was revealed during the course of investigations that large quantities of DSQB shares were purchased from the market through group company DSQ Holdings (earlier known as Square D Holdings and termed as DHL), before the rights issue was announced. After the issue closed, large-scale buying by Pillayar Pattiyar Textiles, another promoter company of DSQB, raised the stock price further, Sebi said. 

 During this period, several other entities (mostly based in Calcutta) had acquired significant quantities of shares of DSQB and were acting in concert with the management of DSQB and Dinesh Dalmiya. 

 According to Sebi, the purchases by the group companies of DSQB were made to create an artificial rise in the price of the scrip. 

 During the personal hearing, DSQB has said it cannot be held liable for the purchase and sale of shares by group companies. However, in the order passed on December 15, G. Ananatharaman, whole-time member of Sebi, said: Being the beneficiary of the rights issue, DSQB cannot deny its role in manipulation of transactions in securities, though it had not participated directly in the market. 

 DSQB has violated the charged provisions of FUTP Regulations. DSQB has altered its financial position by announcing a rights issue. DSQB is a party to the transaction of manipulation alongwith promoters and its group of entities. 

 It was made clear that not only the director, Dinesh Dalmiya, was involved but the company itself was participating in market manipulation through its front entities.

 Dhunseri eyes Lever tea estates in Assam

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Dhanuka: For a fresh brew

 Calcutta, June 13: Dhunseri Tea and Industries is in talks with Hindustan Lever Limited (HLL) to buy out the latters Doom Dooma tea division in Assam and estates in South India.

 Industry watchers say the deal could be worth Rs 140?180 crore.

 We cannot divulge anything right now. But if we get good gardens at the right price, we can always buy them, said C. K. Dhanuka, chairman of the Dhunseri group.

 The Dhunseri group comprises Dhunseri Tea and Industries, Tezpore Tea, Madhuting Tea and Methoni Tea. The group produces 13 million kg of tea, of which 10 million kg is CTC and the rest is orthodox tea. 

 Industry sources say the Dhunseri group has zeroed in on HLLs estates as they are in good shape. The company has been planning to expand its capacity but there were hardly any good gardens up for sale. 

 The Doom Dooma division comprises seven tea estates in Assams Tinsukia district with a planted area of 3100 hectares and three tea processing factories employing 6,100 permanent workers.

 In the last three years, the division has produced 17,100 tonnes of tea. However, it suffered operating losses due to adverse weather conditions, excess supply leading to low prices and high social costs.

 The tea estate division in Tamil Nadu comprises seven gardens (planted area of approximately 3700 hectares) and six tea processing factories with 6,300 permanent employees. In the last three years, the division has produced 31,200 tonnes of tea. It posted a profit in 2004, but suffered losses in 2003 and 2002. Once again, adverse weather conditions, excess supply situation and high social costs hit revenues.

 An HLL spokesperson said, We cannot comment on any merger, acquisition or divestment unless it happens. 

 HLL has received shareholders approval for transfer of its tea plantation business ? both in North and South India ? to wholly-owned subsidiaries of the company.

 The tea industry is in a consolidation mode. The sector is being broadly divided into two ? one set of companies will look after production, while the other will only market tea. Firms like HLL and Tata Tea, which can spend crores on establishing a brand, belong to the second set. 

 HLL has announced that the plantation divisions do not fit into its plan to focus on the FMCG businesses.

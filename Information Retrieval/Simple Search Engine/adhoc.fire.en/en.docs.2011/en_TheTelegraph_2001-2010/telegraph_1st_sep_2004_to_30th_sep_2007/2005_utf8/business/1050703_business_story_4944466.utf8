 Expansion to add shine to Tata Steel 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 2: Tata Steel, the largest private sector steel company in India, has commenced its 2-million tonne (mt) expansion programme at Jamshedpur plant.

 The first step has been taken by placing the order with Outokumpu and Larsen amp; Toubro for setting up the 2 mt iron ore sinter plant.

 Outokumpu, a Swedish company, will be the technology provider in this field. The company has so far designed 300 such plants across the world, including the existing three sinter plants at Jamshedpur works. The sintering process makes iron ore fines suitable for use in blast furnace. 

 The expansion comes at a time when the Laxmi Mittal group and other private players like the Jindals are wooing the Jharkhand state government to allow them to set up operations in the ore-rich state. Last year, Tata Steel had indicated plans to expand its set up in Jharkhand. The companys 2-mt expansion programme is in line with its vision to become a 15-mt steel manufacturing company by 2010.

 Quarterly output

 Tata Steel has completed the first quarter of the current financial year on a buoyant note. Its liquid iron and crude steel production during the April-June period has increased significantly ? liquid iron (commonly known as hot metal) production was 6.5 per cent higher at 1.21 mt than in the corresponding period last year and crude steel production at 1.11 mt was up 5.3 per cent. 

 The gains are noteworthy considering the fact that companys largest furnace was commissioned only in April.

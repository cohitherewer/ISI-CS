 Canon India sharpens focus on small towns

 Setting sights

 Calcutta, April 17: Canon India is moving into smaller towns and cities with its office automation products and consumer durables and has formulated a three-pronged strategy to drive growth.

 Vice-president Alok Bhardwaj said, ?We have seen a growing demand for printers, copiers and digicams from non-metros. We will also start operations in Bhutan from June, which will be managed under the eastern region.?

 The company has clocked a turnover of Rs 264 crore for calendar year 2004 and expects to garner Rs 330 crore this year.

 ?A major part of the growth will be driven by Class B and C cities,? said Bhardwaj. ?This spells good news for the eastern region, which is mainly a cluster of small towns. This could turn the region into a powerhouse.?

 The east contributes around 20 per cent of the total sales of the company. Bhutan is expected to pool in 10 per cent of the revenues from the east.

 Canon is also setting up exclusive outlets for its digicams ? Digi Click Zones ? in Guwahati, Shillong, Patna and Bhubaneswar.

 ?We are expanding the channel base from 75 dealers and 1700 resellers to 150 dealers and 3000 resellers across the country,? said Bhardwaj. 

 ?With our products shifting from being PC-centric to television-centric, we will now be directly competing with consumer electronic companies for shelf space. This will require a very different distribution approach,? he added.

 Canon will also focus on extensive brand building and marketing programmes and has set aside a budget of Rs 20 crore for promotional activities.

 ?Another major area of focus will be the high-end lifestyle segment,? said Bhardwaj. ?Though the segment currently contributes a mere 7 per cent, we expect it to grow to 15 per cent in the next few years.?

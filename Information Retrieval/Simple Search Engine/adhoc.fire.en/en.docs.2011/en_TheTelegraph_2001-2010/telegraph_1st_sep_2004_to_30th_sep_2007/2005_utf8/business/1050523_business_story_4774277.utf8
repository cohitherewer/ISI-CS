 VAT on petrol, diesel in pipeline

 New Delhi, May 22 (PTI): At present, petrol and diesel are out of the value-added tax (VAT) net. Come April 2006, they may not be.

 The mid-term appraisal of the Tenth Five Year Plan, which has been approved by the Union cabinet on May 19, has implicitly recommended bringing petroleum products under the VAT list from the next financial year. It has pointed out that many goods have been kept out of VAT, including petroleum products, which are basic to manufacturing and transport.

 We are not averse to imposing VAT on petroleum products, but we are for gradual expansion of the VAT list. As they say, we hasten but slowly, empowered committee secretary Ramesh Chandra said today.

 Currently, LPG attracts VAT at 12.5 per cent, while petrol and diesel are exempted from the tax.

 The appraisal report will now be put before the National Development Council for its approval. The council is expected to meet next month.

 Explaining the rationale behind keeping petroleum products out of VAT, the white paper released by finance minister P. Chidambaram said prices of these products are not fully market-determined.

 However, the Delhi government had imposed VAT on diesel in this years budget and increased the rate to 20 per cent from 12.5 per cent. While imposition of VAT on diesel was against the empowered committees mandate, increase of the rate to 20 per cent was in line with the VAT panels view on minimum rate of sales tax on the fuel. However, this soon led to shift of diesel trade from Delhi to neighbouring Haryana and Punjab as these two states refused to increase the tax rate on diesel. Following this, the VAT panel permitted Delhi to decrease the rate back to 12.5 per cent.

 Once VAT is imposed on petroleum products, problems like this might come to an end at least among states that have adopted the VAT regime, analysts said.

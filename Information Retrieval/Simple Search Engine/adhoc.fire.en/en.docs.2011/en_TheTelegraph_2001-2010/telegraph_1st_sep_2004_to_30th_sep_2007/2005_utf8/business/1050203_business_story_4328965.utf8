 Calcutta, Feb. 2: Eveready Industries is setting up a state-of-the-art technology park in Chennai in collaboration with Khivraj Tech Park.

 Deepak Khaitan, executive vice-chairman and managing director of Eveready Industries, rolled out the details of the project at a press meet here today.

 The park, Olympia, will come up on an 8.4-acre plot at Guindy, where Eveready earlier had a plant. It will offer over 1 million sq ft of office space spread in three towers ? Citius, Altius and Fortius.

 ?Chennai is being increasingly recognised as the hub of high-value IT services in the country. Olympia will provide the perfect environment and infrastructure for global companies to strengthen their India operations,? said Khaitan, while unveiling the Rs 220-crore project.

 In the first phase, the banks have pledged Rs 73 crore for the project and promoters are putting in Rs 30 crore of equity. This phase will be completed by 2006 and about 6 lakh sq ft of office area will be ready. The entire project will be over by 2008.

 The other partners in the project include the city-based Space Group and M. K. Group.

 The Chennai-based Khivraj Group has already paid Rs 25 crore to Eveready as a price for the land. The group has evinced interests in developing commercial and residential properties in the city. ?We are keen on this part of the country and look forward to opportunities here,? said Ajit Chordia, director, Khivraj Tech Park.

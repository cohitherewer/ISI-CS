 Linc scripts unit shift

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Pen power

 Calcutta, April 17: Linc Pens and Plastics is reconsidering its plan to set up another manufacturing unit in Bengal because of the value-added tax (VAT) imposition.

 The company is now considering shifting its new plant to Uttaranchal or Himachal Pradesh. ?Prior to VAT implementation, there was no sales tax on pens. However, now there would be a 4 per cent tax on the products, which will put us at a disadvantageous position compared with our competitors,? managing director Deepak Jalan said.

 Jalan explained that most of the pen companies are based in Mumbai and Gujarat and have their units in Daman, which is a sales tax exempt state. Similarly, no tax is imposed in Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal. ?We are apprehensive that in such a situation, we may no longer be competitive if we operate from Bengal,? he said.

 ?Also, setting up a unit in these areas will help us aggressively market our products in the northern market,? added Jalan.

 The company has achieved a turnover of Rs 120 crore in 2004-05, a growth of 43 per cent from Rs 83.64 crore achieved in the previous fiscal. ?We have almost doubled our turnover in two years from Rs 62 core in 2002-03 to Rs 120 crore in 2004-05. We hope to maintain this momentum and expect to again double our turnover in two years,? said Jalan.

 Exports of the company grew by 50 per cent to Rs 15 crore last fiscal from Rs 10 crore in the previous one. 

 ?We export mainly to the US and UK markets and have tie-ups with Walmart, W. H. Smith and Pawnland. We are exploring such tie-ups further and also plan to extend our reach in West Asia,? added Jalan.

 The pen industry has grown by around 15 per cent, said Jalan, while the company has grown at three times the industry.

 Jalan said the organised writing instrument industry is around Rs 1,400 crore. Cello occupies the largest market share with around 20 per cent, while Linc features among the top five with a market share of 9 per cent.

 Assam Company weighs demerger

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 21: Assam Company Limited is all set to demerge its tea and oil and natural gas divisions.

 The company has informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that its board will meet on June 28 to discuss the demerger.

 Officials said the company has started exploration in the blocks/fields that have been awarded to it in Assam. It also plans to commercially exploit the potential in the oil and natural gas industry.

 With this perspective, the company is analysing the demerger option for the tea and oil and natural gas divisions for better administrative and financial control, they added.

 The government has awarded two blocks in Assam ? Amguri and AA-ON7 ? to the consortium formed by Assam Company and Canoro Resources, a Canadian firm.

 The company has also been awarded three marginal fields in Assam by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) on a service contract basis. These three are Laxmijan, Barsilla and Bihubar. Under the service contract, Assam Company will extract oil on behalf of ONGC and then sell the products to ONGC.

 The company has started extracting oil and natural gas in the Amguri block. The estimated in place oil reserves are 58 million barrels and the estimated associated and free gas reserves are 95 billion cubic feet.

 Canoro Resources, the operator, holds 60 per cent in the block and the remaining 40 per cent is owned by Assam Company.

 Canoro is our oil equity partner. In AA-ON7, Canoro has a 65 per cent stake and 35 per cent is with us, said senior company officials.

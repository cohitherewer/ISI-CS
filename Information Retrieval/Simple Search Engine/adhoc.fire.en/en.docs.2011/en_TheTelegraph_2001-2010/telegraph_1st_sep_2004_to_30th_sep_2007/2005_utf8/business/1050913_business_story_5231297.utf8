 Promoters take fancy to stake gift

 SATISH JOHN

 Mumbai, Sept. 12: The season for festivities is some way off. But it has not stopped some promoters from gifting huge chunks of shares to their loved ones or close associates.

 It could be the bull market that?s making some of the promoters very generous or there could be something more to it, marketmen say.

 At latest count, promoters of three companies have gifted a significant part of their holdings. While this could be a one-off transaction, there have been occasions earlier when company promoters have sold shares and donated the proceeds to a charitable cause.

 Recently, Prannoy Roy and Radhika Roy ? the company?s current promoters ? transferred 15 per cent of their equity capital in New Delhi Television (NDTV) to their daughter Tara Roy. The value of the gift could be in the region of Rs 211 crore, if the current market price of NDTV shares at Rs 232.35 per share is anything to go by. 

 Tara Roy, by virtue of being an NRI, will own 15 per cent and will enable NDTV to cap the investment limit for foreign institutional investors (FIIs) at 26 per cent, which is the maximum permissible limit prescribed for news and television TV channels. Tara, it is learnt, has recently completed 18 years of age and is studying abroad.

 Adlabs Films, the first company that Anil Ambani set his sights on after the Reliance empire was carved up, also saw some interesting transactions between their erstwhile promoters ? Manmohan Shetty and Vasanji Mamania. 

 Before selling out his stake in Adlabs, Mamania decided to gift 15.16 lakh shares (or a 6.06 per cent stake) to Manmohan Shetty with whom he had co-promoted the company. 

 Termed as an ?inter se transfer amongst promoters (gift transaction), the shareholding of Manmohan Shetty shot up to 33.16 per cent after the gift was made.

 The value of the gift could be Rs 51 crore at current share price of Rs 342.15 a share. It beats many why the former promoter made that gift. Is there a tax angle or is it something else?

 The Infosys promoters have done this before when they donated a portion of their largesse for charitable causes like donations to their alma mater IIT for a new building etc.

 Recently, another such transaction was recorded on the stock markets. This time it was in the pharma major Nicholas Piramal, the flagship company controlled by Ajay Piramal. 

 Nicholas Piramal India said one of the promoter group entities, Piramal Enterprises Limited, trustees of the Piramal Enterprises Executive Trust, had transferred by way of gift (without any consideration), 16.50 lakh equity shares of Rs 2 each of the company (forming 0.86 per cent of the pre-issue capital of the company) to The Ajay G. Piramal Foundation, which is a public charitable Trust. The value of the gift? A tidy Rs 44 crore.

 Hong Kong, Dec. 15: India was backed by China, Japan and several other members of the G20 at the WTO negotiations today as commerce minister Kamal Nath dug in his heels over opening up the agricultural sector. 

 Nath told EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson and US trade representative Robert Portman that no discussion could take place on lowering tariffs in the agricultural sector without providing flexibility for special products and a safeguard mechanism for farmers. 

 No major breakthrough is expected in the current round of WTO talks. The western countries are hammering out a free trade package for least developed countries, which is being seen as a spin to the actual development agenda of the WTO. 

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath today admitted that there was a move to split the ranks of developing countries. The G20 will be holding another round of discussions to draw up a coherent strategy with the LDCs tomorrow. 

 Mandelson was at the receiving end today as ministers of the G20 countries and the US mounted pressure on him to come out with an end date for eliminating the export subsidies that the EU extends to its farmers. 

 It was agreed in the July 2004 framework agreement of the WTO that these export subsidies should be eliminated but the specific date by which this should be done has still not been agreed to. 

 However, the EU wants to use the end date issue as a bargaining chip to extract concessions from its negotiating partners. 

 Mandelson wants the G20 countries to lower tariffs in the industrial sector in return for an announcement on the date for ending export subsidies and scaling down of domestic support to agriculture. 

 However, Nath told him the agriculture issue could not be linked to industry just as the issue of visas for Indians could not be linked to industry.

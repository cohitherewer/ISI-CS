 Reva powered for Japan run

 RAJA GHOSHAL 

 New Delhi, Jan. 9: The Reva, India?s low-cost electric car, is all set to enter the Japanese market.

 The Reva, made by Bangalore?s Maini industrial group, will be exported to Japan as an eco-friendly product.

 The Japanese government has agreed to provide a subsidy of $2,600 for each car. Three models, which will be sold there, will be priced between $12,000 and $13,500, or 1.29 million yen and 1.49 million yen.

 Speaking to The Telegraph, Reva Electric Car Co deputy chairman Chetan Kumar Maini said, ?The models were now being showcased at the Osaka Auto Show. Car lovers are quite enthusiastic about them. The subsidy will be given to customers directly by the Japanese government on purchasing the car.?

 Reva Electric has appointed Takeoka Autocraft as its distributor to market the Reva in select Japanese cities. Maini said, ?The Reva will be positioned in the small and mid-sized car segments and promoted as an ideal alternative environmental vehicle to gasoline-based passenger cars.?

 Reva can be described as a two-door hatchback. It can seat two adults in front and two children at the back. It uses 9 units of electricity for a single full charge that gives a mileage of 80 kilometres in city-driving conditions.

 At home, the Reva, which is priced between Rs 2.6 lakh and Rs 3.2 lakh, has a presence in Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Bangalore. The variations in the car?s prices are not only based on embellishments but also on the road tax imposed by some states. The EEC-certified Reva is available in three variations ? standard, AC and Classe. However, the company did not disclose the number of cars it has sold so far.

 The Reva has been exported to Nepal, Malta, Hong Kong and China. The price is approximately one-third of that of a similar electric vehicle. According to the company, it is one of the reasons for the car?s appreciation in the international market.

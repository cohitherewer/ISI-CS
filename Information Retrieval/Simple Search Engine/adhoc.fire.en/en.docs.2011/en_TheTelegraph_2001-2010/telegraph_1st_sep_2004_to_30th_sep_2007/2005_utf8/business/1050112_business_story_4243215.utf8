 Call to float easy-payment fund for pulses

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: Representatives from the farm sector today asked finance minister P. Chidambaram to consider the creation of a Rs 500-crore revolving fund to enable Food Corporation of India (FCI) to expedite payment for the procurement of pulses and oilseeds.

 ?We have sought a Rs 500-crore revolving fund to be set up by the FCI to expedite payment for purchase of oilseeds and pulses from the growers of these crops in order to encourage their cultivation,? NAFED chairman Ajit Kumar Singh said after a pre-budget meeting of the finance minister with farm-sector representatives.

 Singh said with the government keen to promote the diversification of agriculture, it would be desirable to bring in more farmers into the oilseeds and pulses sectors for which there is a huge demand in the country. A revolving fund faciltiy would encourage farmers since it would enable speedy financial disbursement for the purchase of oilseeds and pulses.

Suggestions have also been made to replace the system of minimum support price (MSP) by remunerative rates and a participatory price insurance scheme.

 The farm sector has also suggested to the finance minister that rural water management schemes initiated in the current years budget should be strengthened with higher allocation of resources and making them more universal.

 The establishment of water resource development funds at the state levels have also been suggested with the involvement of non-government organisations (NGOs) for local water development and distribution. It has been suggested that contributions made to this fund may be made tax-free.

 Khaitan: Looking ahead

 Calcutta, Nov. 29: Eveready Industries India Limited has raised $33 million from its GDR issue. 

 The company had received shareholders approval to raise $40 million. The money will finance the companys acquisition of BPL Soft Energy System Limited ? the battery business of BPL. 

 The fund will also be used to retire high-cost debts of Rs 80-90 crore, said Deepak Khaitan, executive vice-chairman and managing director of Eveready. 

 Khaitan said the company took shareholders approval to raise $40 million, but we later decided not to take it beyond $30 million. We did not require more than that, he said. 

 However, encouraging response from the investors in Southeast Asia and Europe forced the company to mop up another $3 million, taking the figure to $33 million. 

 Eveready, the flagship company of the BM Khaitan group, has acquired the battery business of BPL for Rs 67 crore. 

 It will buy 4.9 lakh shares of BPL Soft Energy System (BSESL) for Rs 45 crore. The deal will bring with it an added liability of Rs 22 crore. 

 Eveready will be able to use the BPL brand name for the next 30 months. However, they can continue with two other brands, BPL Shakti and BPL Power, but without the BPL tag. 

 Khaitan said the market share of the company in the battery business has gone up to 55 per cent after the company acquired BPLs battery business. 

 High input costs have also forced it to raise prices by 5-7 per cent depending on the type of battery.

 Things are looking up and Eveready will do significantly better in the current fiscal, Khaitan added. 

 A portion of the fund raised may also be used for the companys new plant which is coming up at Uttaranchal at a cost of Rs 70 crore.

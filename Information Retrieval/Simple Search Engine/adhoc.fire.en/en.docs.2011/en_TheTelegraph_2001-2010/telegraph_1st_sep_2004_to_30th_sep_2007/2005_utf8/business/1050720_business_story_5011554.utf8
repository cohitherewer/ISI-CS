 Pakistan wakes up to Assam tea

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Pick and choose

 Calcutta, July 19: Pakistan is pining for Assam tea. That?s the message from Indian tea industry officials who have just returned from the neighbouring country. They have been asked to send back samples of Assam tea. Traders there want to test-market the product right away.

 The Pakistani tea industry has also signed business deals with the visiting Indian tea delegation for Assam tea. This is the first time that the neighbour has shown such an interest in Assam tea. It mostly buys the south Indian CTC variety.

 Indian tea traders are keen to develop an Assam blend exclusively for Pakistan.

 ?Pakistan tea officials will take up the matter with Tapal, one of the largest blenders in Pakistan, and Unilever. Later, they will tell us how to go about it,? a member of the Indian delegation said.

 Pakistani officials feel greater interaction between the tea traders of the two countries will improve economic relations, he added.

 South Indian tea is gradually becoming popular in Pakistan; the north Indian variety hardly makes it to that country.

 Indian tea exports to Pakistan have improved in the first five months of this year, when around 3.13 million kg was exported. This is almost equal to the volume of exports in 2004 and 2003. In the last two years, India exported 3.3 million kg of tea. If this trend continues, India could export 8-10 million kg of tea this year.

 Pakistan may raise its imports by 18 per cent this fiscal because of free trade with Bangladesh and Nepal. The import figure may top the $200-million mark in the current fiscal. The volume could increase to 119.84 million kg in 2005-06 compared with 109.45 million kg, valued at $172.15 million, last fiscal.

 Pakistan consumes 140-150 million kg of tea annually, most of which comes from Kenya, Bangladesh, Brazil, Uganda. Around 79.54 million kg or 65 per cent of the requirement is imported from Kenya. 

 The Pakistan tea industry feels that Indian tea has failed to beat the import volumes of Kenya and other African countries because of its high prices.

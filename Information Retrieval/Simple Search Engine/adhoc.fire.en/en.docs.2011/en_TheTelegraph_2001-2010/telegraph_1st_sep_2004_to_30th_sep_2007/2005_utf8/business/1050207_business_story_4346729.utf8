 Yarn firms yearn for sops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 6: The textile industry wants excise concessions for the man-made fibres and yarns segment in the budget for 2005-06.

 In a pre-budget memorandum submitted to finance minister P. Chidambaram, the Federation of All India Textile Manufacturers? Association has recommended a cut in the mandatory excise duty on artificial and synthetic fibres and filament yarns, excluding polyester, to 5 per cent. The mandatory duty on polyester filament yarn (PFY) should be 8 per cent, it added.

 In the 2004-05 budget, the cotton textile firms were exempted from mandatory excise duty. However, PFY attracted a levy of 24 per cent and all other filament yarns and man-made fibres 16 per cent.

 According to the federation, within 4-5 months of the previous budget presentation, adverse impact of the tax structure skewed towards cotton textiles was visible with unsold stocks of man-made textiles piling up and manufacturing activities reduced.

 The federation also pointed out that high import duties affected the user-industry as production cost rose, undermining competitiveness. The import duty on synthetic and artificial fibres and filament yarns in the country is 20 per cent at present. 

 The federation has suggested that the import duty on synthetic and artificial fibres be reduced to zero. It has allayed fears of huge imports and said the move will moderate prices.

 On the technology upgradation fund scheme, which provides cheap finance to the industry for modernisation, the federation said the interest subsidy should be raised to 8 per cent from 5 per cent.

 Garment exporters eye Chinese space

 Mumbai, May 29: Domestic garment exporters expect to make a killing if the United States and the European Union put a cap on Chinese exports of certain categories of textiles. The US and the EU, the world?s two major textile markets, have already initiated moves to limit certain categories of Chinese imports.

 Local firms expects that buyers in the US and the EU would now start looking for alternative suppliers and may look at India. Industry watchers say that some of them have already started receiving queries from prospective customers.

 In some of the categories, India has shown a healthy export performance during the first quarter of the current calendar year. However, this is dwarfed by the stupendous Chinese exports. This comes after export quotas were phased out from January 1.

 On May 18, the Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements (Cita) under the US department of commerce announced that it would slap quotas on four ?threat-based? textile imports from China. These included men?s cotton and man-made fibre shirts (non-knit), man-made fibre trousers, man-made fibre-knit shirts and blouses and combed cotton yarn. Cita said these imports were ?threatening to disrupt the US markets for those products?.

 Prior to this move, Cita had taken similar steps against three other categories ? cotton-knit shirts and blouses, cotton trousers and cotton and man-made fibre underwear.

 The imposition of quotas implies that total shipments of these categories of products will not be able to increase by 7.5 per cent over levels recorded in the past 12 months.

 Elsewhere, the EU?s executive commission also sought to put pressure on China when it urged talks with Beijing over two types of textile imports from the country. These included flax yarn (used to make linen cloth) and T-shirts.

 According to the World Trade Organisation rules, while China must take steps to limit the export of these products within a fixed time frame, the EU can impose its limits.

 Indian exporters view these developments as an opportunity to increase the country?s share in these categories. ?When the Chinese quotas are exhausted, buyers would look for other supply sources. In such a scenario, India has a major advantage,? said an exporter.

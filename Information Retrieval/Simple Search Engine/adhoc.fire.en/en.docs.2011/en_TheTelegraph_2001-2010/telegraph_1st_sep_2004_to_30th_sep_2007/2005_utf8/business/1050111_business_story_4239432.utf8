 German carmakers bet on US growth

 Detroit, Jan. 10 (Reuters): German carmakers feel that a rash of new models would boost sales in the key US market this year. They, however, called for official action to address the dollars weakness against the euro. 

 After US sales of German cars fell 3 per cent in 2004 to 883,000 units, automakers aim to boost turnover in 2005 and expect to regain a US market share above 10 per cent, said Bernd Gottschalk, head of the German car industry association VDA. 

 In the long term, German carmakers, including Volkswagen, Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche, hope to sell more than 1 million cars a year in the world?s biggest auto market, he told a news conference at the Detroit car show. 

 VDA expects the US market to stagnate this year at around 16.9 million cars and light trucks. 

 He said German manufacturers would also benefit from their expertise in fuel-efficient diesel technology, which they hoped to convince increasing numbers of US customers to buy. 

 Gottschalk said German carmakers were still worried about the impact of a weak dollar even though the US currency had come off recent record lows against the euro. 

 ?We will have unadulterated joy from the US market only if the dollar continues to climb,? he said.

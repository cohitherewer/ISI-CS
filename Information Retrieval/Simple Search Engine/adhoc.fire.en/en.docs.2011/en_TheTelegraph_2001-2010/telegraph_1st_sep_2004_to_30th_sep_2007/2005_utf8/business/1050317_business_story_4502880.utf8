 Former WorldCom chief found guilty

 New York, March 16 (Reuters): Former WorldCom Inc chief executive Bernard Ebbers, a one-time milkman who turned an obscure long-distance phone carrier into a telecommunications giant, was found guilty on Tuesday of orchestrating an $11-billion accounting scandal that drove the company into bankruptcy.

 The federal jury returned its verdict on the eighth day of deliberations, convicting the 63-year-old Ebbers of fraud, conspiracy and filing false documents with securities regulators. He is set to be sentenced on June 13 and faces up to 85 years in prison.

 The tall, bearded Ebbers, who worked as a coach, bouncer and milkman before getting into the telecommunications business, sat with his hands folded as the verdict was read and showed little reaction. He then turned to hug his wife, who was crying.

 ?We profoundly disagree with the verdict,? said Reid Weingarten, the lead attorney for Ebbers, promising to appeal the conviction. ?The fight will continue.?

 Ebbers declined to comment to reporters after the verdict, which was viewed as a major victory for federal prosecutors and corporate governance reformists.

 Ebbers spent two days on the witness stand during the trial defending himself against charges that he masterminded an accounting fraud at the worldwide telecom giant he transformed through a series of takeovers beginning in the early 1980s.

 Along the way, Ebbers became widely regarded as a savvy entrepreneur and maverick, cementing his reputation in 1998 with the $40-billion purchase of MCI Communications Corp, the largest acquisition in corporate history at the time.

 Those who knew Ebbers describe him as a brusque and exacting executive with a quick temper, known to toss underlings out of meetings and publicly embarrass them.

 Cost-conscious and a stickler for odd details, he went so far as to count the cars in the parking lots at night in the Clinton, Mississippi, headquarters to see how many people were working late and who was going home. But he could also be a charming and folksy CEO, who preferred cowboy boots to suits, opened shareholder meetings with a prayer, ate lunch in the cafeteria and ran a company that had become a Wall Street darling by the late 1990s.

 WorldCom?s finances and popularity began to deteriorate, however, as the dot-com bubble burst and growth of the telecommunications industry slowed. By late 2000, WorldCom accountants began making false entries to hide the financial problems from investors and the public.

 Ebbers has maintained he was unaware of the fraud: indeed, he told the jury of seven women and five men that he would have put a stop to it had he known it was occurring.

 Instead, he said, he was kept in the dark about the financial tricks used by chief financial officer Scott Sullivan, one of six WorldCom executives indicted when investigators uncovered the $11-billion scandal in 2002. ?He never told me he had made an entry that wasn?t right,? Ebbers testified. ?If he had, we wouldn?t be here today.?

 Khandelwal: Focused

 Mumbai, May 20: Bank of Baroda (BoB) has posted a 35.24 per cent lower net profit at Rs 101.04 crore in the fourth quarter ended March 31 compared with Rs 156.02 crore in the year-ago period because of a fall in treasury income.

 For the year ended March 31, the net profit declined by 30 per cent to Rs 676.84 crore from Rs 967 crore in 2003-04.

 The fall in profit came even as its net interest income increased 40 per cent to Rs 879.67 crore (Rs 628.18 crore) during the year. 

 While global advances during the year gained 22 per cent at Rs 43,400.38 crore, BoBs global deposits increased 11.47 per cent to Rs 81,333.47 crore. Retail lending has seen a robust growth of 51.34 per cent to Rs 6383.06 crore from Rs 4217.76 crore, forming around 17 per cent of the banks total domestic advances.

 The net non-performing assets (NPAs) of the bank has come down to Rs 619.65 crore from Rs 1042.01 crore, a reduction of 40.53 per cent. Gross sticky assets of the bank also came down to Rs 3322 crore from Rs 3980 crore in 2003-04.

 Chairman and managing director A. K. Khandelwal revealed four major focus areas for the bank. These include a using technology extensively, bringing down the net NPAs to nil, adopting a customer-centric approach and increasing credit offtake by more than 30 per cent. This comes even as the bank is designing a new logo that will communicate its customer initiatives.

 We are also pursuing an aggressive strategy in the retail segment. Retail loans now form 17 per cent of the banks total advances. We plan to take this up to 51 per cent, he said. 

 BoB had recently chosen HP for its ambitious technology-enabled business transformation project that seeks to provide its domestic and international customers a seamless service.

 BoB has also lined up plans for another public issue, which is scheduled for September.

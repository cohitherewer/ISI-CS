Ebbers handed 25-year prison term

New York, July 13: Bernard J. Ebbers, the founder 

and former chief executive of WorldCom, was sentenced to 25 years in prison today 

for his role in a $11-billion accounting fraud that brought down the telecommunications 

company in 2002.

Judge Barbara S. Jones handed down the sentence in 

federal district court in Manhattan, saying he deserved a stiff sentence. Ebbers 

was the instigator of the fraud, the judge said as she prepared to pronounce 

his sentence.

On his arrival in court this morning, Ebbers, 63, 

appeared tense, and he shoved one of the news photographers covering the scene.

The punishment is among the toughest of those given 

to top executives implicated in large-scale corporate wrongdoing, and it should 

help the government negotiate settlements as it prosecutes others, legal analysts 

said. More important, prosecutors said, it should prove to be a deterrent.

As WorldComs chairman and chief executive, Ebbers 

was accused of orchestrating the largest corporate fraud in US history, an accounting 

scheme that inflated the companys profits by $11 billion over several years.

With the money it raised from investors who bought 

its high-flying stock, WorldCom acquired dozens of other businesses, and competitors 

like AT amp;T overhauled their own operations to try to keep pace with its phantom 

earnings.

When the extent of WorldComs fraud became clear 

in 2002, its stock price plummeted, and the company soon filed for bankruptcy 

protection. It has since emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy under the name of 

a company it acquired, MCI, and agreed in May to an acquisition by Verizon.

Ebbers took the witness stand during the trial ? a 

move that legal analysts described as a gamble ? and maintained that he had no 

knowledge of the fraud at the company.

A few jurors later said Ebberss testimony had 

at time seemed evasive and had persuaded them of his guilt. After eight days of 

deliberation, the jurors convicted him in March of securities fraud, conspiracy 

and seven counts of filing false reports with regulators. Federal sentencing guidelines, 

which a Supreme Court ruling last year declared nonbinding, pointed to a sentence 

of 30 years to life imprisonment.

Federal prosecutors had sought a life sentence as 

a deterrent. Corporate executives will, in the future, consider the sentence 

imposed on Ebbers whenever those executives are tempted to mislead shareholders 

or manipulate the financial statements of their companies, the prosecutors 

said in their brief requesting life in prison.

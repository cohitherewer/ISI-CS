The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Post-VAT prices come under Bengal scanner

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Bachawat: Watchful 

 Calcutta, May 6: More than a month after the introduction of the value-added tax (VAT) regime, the Bengal government has convened a meeting tomorrow with industry representatives to examine the impact of the tax on prices.

 There are a number of items where the VAT rates are lower than the previous sales tax rates. In such cases, the benefit ideally would have been passed on to the consumer by way of reduced prices.

 However, very few industries have done so. 

 C. M. Bachawat, commissioner of commercial taxes, West Bengal, said the state would urge industry to reduce prices if the general price trend has remained static.

 ?We will compare the prices here with those in non-VAT states. If the prices in those states have remained static, then there is a case for reduction in prices of those items where the VAT rates are lower than the earlier sales tax rates,? Bachawat told The Telegraph.

 However, he clarified that the government had only a limited role to play in effecting price reduction in todays open economy.

 ?The market forces will determine the prices. If a manufacturer wants to make more profits by not passing on the benefits, some other will. And eventually the prices will come down,? Bachawat argued.

 He explained, in case of packaged goods, it takes time changing the label and package and, hence, price changes take time. ?We have to give them some time. However, a month has passed and it should take place now.?

 The state government had earlier said that it would keep a close watch on price movements after VAT was in place. 

 Tomorrows meeting will be attended by companies representing various industries like paints, paper, oil and medical. 

 It should be recalled that VAT rates are lower than previous sales tax rates for many items such as cement, cooked food, cosmetics, drugs and medicine and soap.

 Super built-up puzzle deconstructed

 Looking for an apartment but lost in the labyrinth of real estate jargon? Propertt brings down to earth such verbal skyscrapers as ?super built-up?, ?built-up? and ?carpet area? so that you are better prepared while meeting the real estate agent next time.

 Carpet area? What is that? 

 It tells you exactly how much space you will have at your disposal in your home. It is the area within the inner faces of the walls of your home.

 How do I measure the carpet area of my apartment?

 You can separately measure the floor area of every room, kitchen, toilet, veranda -? virtually all the space where you can put your feet on. Add up all the measurements. The sum will give you the carpet area.

 Ok. What is built-up area?

 Built-up area includes the area occupied by the walls of your home.

 God! Do I have to start measuring the walls now?

 Not necessarily. Here is a thumb rule: built-up area is generally 15 per cent more than the carpet area of a flat. 

 Then what is super built-up area? 

 Super built-up area is what builders often talk about. It is an all-inclusive term and takes into account carpet area, built-up area and the proportionate area under the common spaces.

 Common space is a common headache. Can it be defined? 

 The common space on each floor includes the share of the lobby, staircase, elevator and the corridor outside the apartment. The common space of the building includes the terrace, security room, electrical room and pump room. 

 Well. It looks pretty straightforward. Where does the confusion come from then?

 The confusion often arises when the areas to be included in the common space are left to the discretion of the builder. Some include only the common space on each floor while others add those of the building, too. 

 In case of a building, how will we measure the common space for each apartment?

 The total area of these extras is taken into account and divided by the number of apartments in proportion to their size.

 For instance, if the common space on the floor is 400 sq ft, it should be shared among the flats in line with the proportion of floor space enjoyed by them. 

 If a builder offers me a particular super built-up area, how much do I have in hand?

 If you are given a quote for a 1,000-sq ft flat and the area referred to is the carpet area, you have a huge living space. If it is built-up area, you have lesser space and if it is super built-up area, you compromise heavily on the living area. In fact, the actual carpet area may just be around 600 sq ft, though the total flat area is 1,000 sq ft. 

 Is there a fixed ratio of super built-up to carpet area?

 Generally, the ratio of super built-up to carpet area in the market is 70:30. But unscrupulous builders may go as low as 60:40. So a quote on a 3,000-sq ft apartment could mean a carpet area of anywhere from 1,800 sq ft to 2,100 sq ft.

 Do I need to take some precautions?

 Always ask the seller exactly how much the super built-up area and the carpet area amount to and ensure that this break-up appears in the agreement of sale, too. 

 How do I compare the rates offered by different builders?

 Compare rates on like-to-like basis. If a builder offers the price at super built-up area and the other on carpet, ask the former to spell out the carpet area.

 Labour law lacunae precipitate inequality

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: The World Bank has criticised Indias labour laws and imperfections in the capital market, which are leading to wider economic inequality in the country. 

 The best available estimates suggest that inequality in India has been rising, but with no solid assessment of by how much, said the World Bank development report on Equity and Development.

 Emphasising the need for labour reforms, the report said, Poorly designed or inappropriate government intervention can also be inefficient and bad for long-term growth.

 Referring to labour laws laid down in the Industrial Disputes Act of 1947, it said, States that amended the legislation in the direction of reinforcing security rights of workers and other pro-labour measures had lower output and productivity growth in manufacturing sector than those who did not change it or made it more flexible.

 Relatively protective legislation may have reduced opportunities for workers ? especially the majority without a formal sector job, it added. 

 The World Bank has pointed out glaring instances of inequality in the countrys credit market.

 Citing an ADB report, it said deposit rates in non-banking finance companies are not more than 12 per cent for a year, but interests on loan advances ranged from 48 per cent annually to an astronomically high of 5 per cent per day.

 This is despite the fact that default rates are low at 3 per cent of the total interest costs.

 In rural India, the report said interest rates are not only high but also variable with the rich forking out a lower interest rates than the poor.

 Surveys conducted in the villages of Kerala and Tamil Nadu have revealed that the rich with Rs 1 lakh in assets got about 60 per cent of the credit and paid a relatively low 33 per cent rate of interest. The poor, on the other hand, got only 8 per cent of the credit even after paying a 104 per cent rate of interest.

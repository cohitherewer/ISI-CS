 Bangalore, Sept. 19: United Breweries will set up three new breweries and expand the capacities of the existing ones over the next five years at an investment of Rs 100 crore, said UB Group chairman Vijay Mallya.

 We are planning greenfield breweries in Orissa, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. These are important markets that are growing, Mallya said on the sidelines of UBs annual general meeting here today.

 The company will leverage the distribution muscle of its partner, Scottish amp; Newcastle, to step up beer sales abroad.

 Mallya spoke about the rising demand for beer in the domestic market. Though the price of alcohol beverages is controlled by state governments, the industry is buoyant and the demand for beer is increasing, he said.

 The UB board had declared an interim dividend of 15 per cent. This was the first dividend declared by the company since 2001, Mallya said.

 UBs sales grew 19 per cent in the April to August period compared with last year. We have more than commensurate growth in profitability (in the April- August period), Mallya told shareholders.

 On Kingfisher Airlines, Mallya said the company would buy more jets from Airbus Industrie. The airline has bought 10 Airbus A-320 aircraft with an option to buy 20 more. We are looking at tying up funds for other aircraft, he said.

 The airline plans to include the A-330, A-380 and A-350 aircraft in its fleet in the next decade. 

 In the next six months, Kingfisher Airlines will decide on whether to tap the capital market to raise funds for fleet expansion.

 A number of people are excited about Kingfisher Airlines, a 100 per cent subsidiary of UB Holdings, and are keen to invest in it. It depends on the right value. At UB, we have never sold cheap, Mallya said.

 The UB Group has served a notice on the Karnataka government for Rs 15 crore as damages for shelving the elevated light rail transit system (ELRTS) in Bangalore that was proposed through an international consortium. Mallya said the project was dropped during the previous Congress regime as the state government had failed to come up with its share of equity and guarantees.

 We have written to the state government asking for reimbursement of all the expenses because we were clear that the project was not abandoned at our instance or initiative. We tried everything that was logically possible, he said.

 On whether the group would be keen to relaunch the ELRTS project, he said it would not be worth the effort as the cost and route have changed. Besides, it would be a difficult task to reunite an international consortium for the project, he added.

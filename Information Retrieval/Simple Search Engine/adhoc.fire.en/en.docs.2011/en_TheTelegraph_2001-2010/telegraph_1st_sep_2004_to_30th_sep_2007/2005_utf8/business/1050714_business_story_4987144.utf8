 Orissa plan to meet industry demand

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, July 13: The Orissa government has drawn up a masterplan to improve the condition of roads in four industrial zones and mining hubs to cater to new projects in the state.

 The state works department, which has prepared the masterplan, will develop the first steel zone in Keonjhar and Duburi, the second at Sundargarh, a coal zone in Talcher and a bauxite zone in Kalahandi, Raygada and Nuapara in the next five years.

 The plan is important as the projected steel production capacity of the state is estimated at 56.4 million tonnes per annum by 2016. This will involve transporting around 222 million tonnes of raw materials and finished products to and from steel plants. 

 However, the existing road and railway networks cannot handle such a huge cargo traffic, especially in the Duburi-Paradip industrial cluster, said works secretary Ratnakar Dash.

 The deadline for the completion of the Daitari-Banspani railway line has been extended to 2007. 

 The works department has estimated that 12347.5 km of the existing national and state highways and district roads need to be improved at a cost of Rs 3584.74 crore. 

 Poscos steel plant at Paradip will require a direct transportation link with the coal and steel belt of Talcher, Keonjhar and Jajpur. 

 The demands of the existing road network in and around the Paradip port and mining hubs of Keonjhar have changed significantly in recent years because of large-scale mining activities and establishment of other industrial projects in these areas. 

 This has resulted in a phenomenal growth in vehicles on the national highways passing through these areas.

 Fares nosedive at Air Sahara

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 19: Following the footsteps of Indian Airlines, Air Sahara today replaced its cheap fare schemes with new offers that the private carrier claims will make tickets 20-70 per cent cheaper. 

 The new scheme, Solar Fares, offers significant discounts to passengers on any flight, provided seats on the low-fare buckets are available. There would be seven levels of fares, including the normal one.

 The scheme will be in force during the monsoon months, but it may be reworked once the peak winter season starts. 

 The lowest Delhi-Calcutta fare on an Air Sahara flight will be Rs 3,333 compared with the normal Rs 10,095 fare. Similarly, the Delhi-Mumbai lowest fare would be Rs 3,333 compared with the normal fare of Rs 8,870.

 On the Delhi-Chennai route, the lowest fare would be Rs 4,999 against the normal fare of Rs 13,210; on the Delhi-Bangalore sector, the lowest fare would be Rs 3,555 compared with the regular fare of Rs 12,830.

 On the Calcutta-Mumbai route, the lowest fare would be Rs 3,666; it would be Rs 2,888 for the Calcutta-Hyderabad flight. An Air Sahara official said Rs 500 would be charged for cancellation of these tickets up to one hour before departure.

 Electrolux to boost growth

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 14: Electrolux Kelvinator India is preparing a war chest for bolstering its business in the country.

 The investments for the next year will be finalised by the month-end, said Sanjeev Wadhwa, general manager (marketing), Electrolux Kelvinator India. 

 We will aggressively move into markets like Punjab and the southern region, except Kerala, where we are not doing as good as other regions. This will include introduction of new products with features that are region specific and strengthening of the distribution network, he added. 

 The company will launch a wide range of cost-competitive direct cool refrigerators, entry-level semi-automatic washing machines and convection microwaves.

 Wadhwa said that Punjab and Tamil Nadu would be at the centre of the companys market expansion strategy.

 The semi-urban market contributes to 72 per cent of our entire consumer appliances sales. We will continue to aim at these areas with our launches, he added.

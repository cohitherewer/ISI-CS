 Whiff of gas bounty on Orissa coast

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Piping hot 

 Calcutta, April 10: If the giant gas find of Krishna-Godavari basin was the biggest discovery of 2002 in the world, gear up for an encore this year.

 A consortium of Reliance Industries and Niko Resources of Canada, which got lucky with the D-6 block in the Krishna-Godavari basin, is expected to announce a huge find off the coast of Orissa.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar told The Telegraph he was hopeful of a large gas discovery in block NEC-25. However, he declined to comment on the size of the reserve. ?I am constrained by the existing regulations of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) from divulging more details. However, we are hoping the NEC-25 could be what the Krishna-Godavari find was in 2002.?

 The block is located near the Mahanadi basin in Orissa. Reliance has 90 per cent participating interest in the block, while the rest is with Niko. Reliance is the operator of the block.

 Both Reliance and Niko declined to comment on the potential reserve in the block.

 However, the Niko website reveals details about the NEC-25 block.

 In a statement to shareholders, Edward S. Sampson, chairman of the board, president and chief executive officer of Niko Resources, said the first four wells have been drilled at the NEC-25 block and proven the presence of commercial hydrocarbons. 

 The fifth exploratory well, B-1, completed drilling and was the fifth consecutive gas discovery on this block. A sixth exploration well, B-2, is currently drilling at a location approximately eight kilometres from the A-1 discovery. 

 Plans are progressing to fast track gas production from the NEC-25 block. Further details on the discovery would be released when available, Sampson said.

 NEC-25 covers 3.5 million acres. Utilising the 2D and 3D seismic, several rollover anticlines at the miocene level have been identified. These structures are smaller than those on Block D6 (KG Basin) with potential reserves in the 1 to 2 trillion cubic feet range each. The development gains significance because it brightens prospects of availability of natural gas in eastern India.

 The region, which was starved of any major petroleum resources (except the old Assam assets of ONGC), now hopes to boast good gas reserve.

 Apart from the Reliance-Niko D-6 block in the KG basin, which has 14 TCF of gas-in-place and another proven gas block of ONGC in the same basin, positive indications are there in the Gail-Gazprom block offshore Digha in Bengal.

 ONGC is also taking up a mega exploration project in the Mahanadi basin that is adjacent to NEC-25.

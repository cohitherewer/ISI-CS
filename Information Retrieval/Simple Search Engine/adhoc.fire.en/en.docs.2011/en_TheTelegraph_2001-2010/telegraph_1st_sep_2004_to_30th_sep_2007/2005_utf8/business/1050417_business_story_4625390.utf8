 Modest growth in Citi net

 New York, April 16 (Reuters): Citigroup Inc on Friday reported a 3-per-cent rise in first-quarter profit, driven by growth in retail banking and credit cards, and authorised the buyback of up to an additional $15 billion of common stock.

 Citigroup, the world?s largest financial services company, said net income from investment banking and wealth management fell during the quarter.

 The stock buyback programme authorises repurchases over the next 18 months. It had $1.3 billion left under a prior programme.

 Net income rose to $5.44 billion, or $1.04 per share, from $5.27 billion, or $1.01 per share, a year earlier.

 Profit from continuing operations was $5.17 billion, or 99 cents per share.

 Revenue rose 6 per cent to $21.5 billion, compared with analysts? forecast for $22.6 billion. Operating expenses rose 12 per cent to $11.7 billion, but were little changed from the fourth quarter.

 Results included $272 million in charges that ?reflect expense discipline and ongoing consolidation activities to improve operating efficiencies?. Chief executive Charles Prince said.

 Results also included a $109 million loss on the sale of some loans, and $183 million of gains.

 Consumer profit rose 9 per cent to $2.82 billion.

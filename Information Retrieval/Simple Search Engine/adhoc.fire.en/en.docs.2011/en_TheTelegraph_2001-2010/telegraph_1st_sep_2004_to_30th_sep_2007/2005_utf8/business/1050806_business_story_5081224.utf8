 Bhel selloff put on hold

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dev: Fair play

 New Delhi, Aug. 5: The divestment of Bharat Heavy Electricals (Bhel) has been put on hold and a stake sale in Tide Water Oil will depend on the recommendations of the Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises (BRPSE), heavy industries minister Santosh Mohan Dev said today. 

 We are a transparent government. We will consider all the objections to the stake sale in Bhel. Till the consultations are over, we will not go ahead with the sale of Bhel shares, the minister said.

 Dev said the heavy industry ministrys proposal to sell a stake in Tide Water Oil would be put before the board along with the case for revival of holding company Andrew Yule. The government wants to sell its entire 27 per cent stake in Tide Water Oil. It also plans to sell the electrical equipment business of Andrew Yule.

 ONGC is among the companies conducting a due diligence of Tide Water Oil with a view to picking up a stake in the company.

 Regarding the sale of the remaining government stake in Maruti, the minister said, It is not in my pocket.

 The finance ministry has agreed to look into the demand of its heavy industries counterpart for more funds to revive the sick PSUs recommended by the BRPSE, Dev said on the sidelines of a conference organised by the standing committee on public enterprises.

 The minister said both finance minister P. Chidambaram and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia assured him yesterday that they would look into the demand.

 The finance ministry feels that the government does not have adequate funds to revive all the sick companies recommended by the BRPSE. 

 So far, only two of the 17 companies cleared by the board have been allocated funds for revival by the cabinet. The government is under pressure from the Left parties to allocate more funds for the sick PSUs as this is part of the common minimum programme adopted by the UPA coalition.

 The Left parties are also staunchly opposed to offloading even small portions of equity of the public sector in the market as they fear that this would lead to the back-door privatisation of the navratna companies through the creeping acquisition route.

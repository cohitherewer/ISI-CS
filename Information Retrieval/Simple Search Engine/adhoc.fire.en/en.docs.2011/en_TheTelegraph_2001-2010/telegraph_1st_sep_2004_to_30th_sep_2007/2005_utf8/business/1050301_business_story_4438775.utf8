 Rs 10000 chastity belt against black money

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

10000 and no more

New Delhi, Feb. 28: Just when it seemed that 

P. Chidambaram was meandering to the end of the two-hour budget speech, he came 

up with a shocker of a proposal that sparked howls of protests.

 The Dream Budget Man came up with a nightmarish plan: a tax of 0.1 per cent on cash withdrawals from banks of over Rs 10,000 in a single day.

 If that causes alarm, there was more in the fine print of Finance Bill 2005. 

 The levy ? which has been dubbed the banking cash transaction tax ? will also extend to purchase of a bank draft or a banker?s cheque or any other financial instrument on payment of cash of more than Rs 10,000.

 But that?s not all. The encashment of a term deposit with a scheduled bank above the Rs 10,000 threshold will also attract the tax. 

 BJP members of Parliament were on their feet the moment Chidambaram made his claim that the tax had been imposed as a means of checking cash spending which fuel a black, untaxed economy.

 ?A lot of people who are complaining are protesting about the tax trail that this impost will leave behind,? Chidambaram told reporters later in the afternoon.

 The Opposition feels that the tax is an unnecessary irritant that will unduly trouble honest taxpayers. Even MPs from the Left, who otherwise supported the budget, have objections to the tax. 

 The finance minister realises this opposition and sources said he would in all probability agree to raise the threshold limit for this transaction tax in line with suggestions in Parliament. 

 Said Abani Roy, the RSP?s leader in Parliament: ?The principle is good. Encourage a cheque economy which is whiter.... (but) he should have targeted cash withdrawals of a higher denomination, say Rs 1 lakh. The tax on such small withdrawals as Rs 10,000 which even middle class people make to pay their grocery or other bills will only cause irritation.? 

 Bankers say most of the single cash transactions in any given bank branch are of denominations up to Rs 5,000, but a significant 35-40 percentage of transactions is above Rs 10,000.

 To crack down on tax evasion, Chidambaram said the banks would be required to report to the government all deposits that are exempt from the interest earned on tax deducted at source. 

 Chidambaram said the measure was not designed to earn revenues and refused to accept that it could net any significant amount for the exchequer. 

 Industrialists and bankers, too, slammed the proposal. Anand Mahindra of Mahindra amp; Mahindra lashed out at the proposal, saying: ?It is ludicrous. You must have heard the noise in Parliament. There is going to be a lot of emotional ruckus on it and people are going to say, ?it is my money?. This won?t work.?

 HSBC?s Naina Lal Kidwai termed the idea an ?administrative nightmare?. ?If you want to discourage black money, you should hit at the source of the generation of this money. This move could lead to the parallel economy that exists as an alternative to banks,? she said.

The storm over the bank transaction tax also appeared 

to deflect attention from the more sweeping banking sector reforms that the Reserve 

Bank unveiled later in the evening.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Jet issue oversold more than 15 times 

 SATISH JOHN

 Great going

 Mumbai, Feb. 24: Fidelity, Templeton and SAC Capital have set their sights on all shares set aside for institutional buyers in the Jet Airways initial public offering (IPO), which was oversold 15 times at the close today.

 Small investors, who scrambled with their bids in the last few days, are racing for three times the shares reserved for them. Sources collating the offer response told The Telegraph this evening that each of the three FIIs named above want the entire 60 per cent block meant for qualified institutional buyers to land in their lap. 

 According to investment banking sources, their bids are for more than 8 million shares ? this is the just the number that have been earmarked for this category of investors. 

 Temasek, the government of Singapore?s investment arm, has bid for 3 million shares. Investment bankers mention SBC Global Asset Management, ABN Amro and European investment house Robeco as the other key bidders among institutions. Life Insurance Corporation has put in applications for 2 million shares.

 According to sources, the high net-worth investors came in late and, therefore, were still being accounted for. The value of the applications is more than Rs 28,000 crore. Almost 98 per cent of the bids for the flotation have come in at the upper limit of the Rs 950-1125 price range.

 By late this evening, the number of applications had crossed the four-lakh mark. Bids were sent for more than 23 crore shares compared with the issue size of 1.72 crore. The process of collating data was still under way and a clear picture is likely to emerge by Friday, sources said. The numbers did not surprise market watchers, given that the private airline company?s offer was sold out in 10 minutes on February 18, the first day of the issue.

 Retail investors rushed in their applications in the last two days. This was expected since they typically join the queue in the penultimate days of a maiden issue.

 Of the 1.72 crore shares it has put on the block, Jet Airways is making a fresh issue of 1.42 crore while the remaining 30.21 lakh are being sold by Naresh Goyal?s Tail Winds.

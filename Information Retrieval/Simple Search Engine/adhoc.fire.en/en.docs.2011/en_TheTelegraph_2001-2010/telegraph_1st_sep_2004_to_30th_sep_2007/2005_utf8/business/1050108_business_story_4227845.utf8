 FM fans recovery run

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 7: The markets decided to end a rather volatile week with a smart recovery. 

 Taking a cue from finance minister P Chidambaram who visited the Bombay Stock Exchange today, the equity markets took a U turn after two days of meltdown. The 30-share BSE sensex gained 53 points, with Reliance Industries and cement shares leading the relief rally.

 Chidambaram said the sensex? slide show over the last two days was quite orderly after its giddy rise.?The fall is just a market correction and the movement in the capital markets was quite orderly after the giddy rise for the last few days,? he said.

 The finance minister said the government does not agree or disagree with reports that the recent market crash was ?unusual? ? a description used by Sebi chief G. N. Bajpai. However, investors should be prepared to face the uncertainties in the equity markets, he added.

 ?The government is not responsible for the recent sensex fall. It?s the market sentiment that lifts it up or down,? he added.

 The sensex had plummeted by more than 4 per cent during the past two sessions after hitting a lifetime high on Tuesday. Market watchers thought foreign institutional investors were behind this fall, but Sebi figures have revealed that FIIs clocked net sales of only Rs 57.90 crore on Wednesday.

 However, in today?s trading, share values turned around with Reliance leading the rally. The stock opened at Rs 528, shot to an intra-day high of Rs 547.50 and closed at Rs 540.85, a gain of Rs 14.90.

 Cement stocks were on a roll on expectations of a price hike. ACC gained by Rs 6.75 to close at Rs 350.35, while Gujarat Ambuja Cements shot up by Rs 10.25 to Rs 426.30. The positive statements on the reforms process made by the finance minister also helped sentiment.

 The sensex opened higher at 6371.73 and moved to an intra-day high of 6440.31, before closing at 6420.46 against thursdays close of 6367.39, a net rise of 53.07 points.

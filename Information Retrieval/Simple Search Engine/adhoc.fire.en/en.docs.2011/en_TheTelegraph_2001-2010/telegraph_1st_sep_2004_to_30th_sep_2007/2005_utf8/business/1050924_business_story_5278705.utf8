 More foreign firms in oil hunt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 23: The government plans to change its policy of awarding exploration blocks to companies so that foreign firms with cutting-edge technology join the countrys oil hunt. 

 Instead of having uniform bid evaluation criteria for all deep sea, shallow water and onland blocks, we ought to consider separate categorisation of blocks based on the risk involved, Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said today.

 At the contract signing ceremony for 18 oil and gas exploration blocks awarded under the fifth round of the new exploration licensing policy (Nelp), the minister said the country would also move towards an open acreage system. 

 He said the government would launch the sixth round of bidding for oil and gas blocks under Nelp in January with changes in the licensing policy. 

 As a first step towards the open acreage system, the government plans to set up a national data repository, where data from the blocks under exploration and the new ones to be awarded would be stored.

 The ministry would incorporate some suggestions made by Petrofed in a study. 

 The companies which signed the production sharing contracts today included Reliance, Hardy Exploration and Production India Inc, Niko Resources, ONGC, GAIL, Cairn Energy, Oil India and HPCL. 

 The minister said he had assured the companies that contracts for the 18 blocks would be signed by September and this deadline has been met. 

 The oil companies are likely to begin exploration by January next year. The minimum investment committed by the bidders in these 18 blocks is Rs 1,653 crore in the first phase and Rs 3,771 crore in all the three phases.

 Cooking gas

 Aiyar said the existing scheme of limiting the number of LPG cylinders supplied to distributors would be reviewed as they were still diverting subsidised cooking gas to the black market and depriving genuine households of their required supplies. 

 The minister said the petroleum ministry would come out with a new scheme and chalk out a strategy to clamp down on unscrupulous LPG distributors. He said the oil companies had statistics pertaining to the number of households being supplied by each distributor and were supplying LPG to them on the premise that one cylinder should last each customer 40 days.

 Ruia eyes ailing Orissa mills

 Ruia: Looking out

 Calcutta, Dec. 30: After snapping up Dunlop and Falcon, Pawan Ruia is on the prowl again. The Calcutta-based baron is close to acquiring Hirakud Cables and Idcol Rolling Mills (IRLM), both ailing firms owned by the Orissa government.

 The shareholder purchase agreement (SPA) with Idcol, an Orissa government arm, is expected to be signed shortly. 

 Hirakud Cables makes transmission towers and cables. ?Hirakud Cables will facilitate forward integration for Jessop amp; Co. The buyout will be a win-win proposition for both,? Ruia told The Telegraph. The deal could be worth Rs 15-20 crore.

 For Jessop, fabrication is an area of core competence, which will be deepened when Hirakud Cables enters the fold. 

 The group will invest Rs 20 crore in reviving the units. Initially, the focus will be on turning around Hirakud Cables, which is still in production. Idcol will be taken up later.

 Hirakud clocked a turnover of Rs 10-15 crore in 2004-05. This could go up to around Rs 100 crore in one-and-a-half years from now.

 The range of products manufactured at Hirakud will also be expanded, while Idcol?s rolling mills will give the group a new venture it can utilise at any point in future.

 The two companies will give Ruia control over a huge swathe of real estate, which is believed to be as much as 250 acres.

 Dunlop deal

 Ruia is close to signing a broad-based wage agreement with workers of Dunlop?s Sahagunj factory, possibly in 10 to 15 days.

 The new Dunlop India chief has offered to settle wage dues of Rs 30-35 crore over three years, though workers have been pressing for the money to be released before that.

 Of the 2,700 workers at Sahagunj, Ruia said only 1,000-1,100 would be required in the initial stage. The rest will get VRS. 

 As talks with workers continue, so do efforts to clear electricity dues and sort out sales tax issues with the Bengal government. ?I hope the factory will be back in production in six months,? Ruia said. Earlier, there were indications that the process could take at least 9-12 months. Dunlop?s Ambattur unit will get back on its feet earlier.

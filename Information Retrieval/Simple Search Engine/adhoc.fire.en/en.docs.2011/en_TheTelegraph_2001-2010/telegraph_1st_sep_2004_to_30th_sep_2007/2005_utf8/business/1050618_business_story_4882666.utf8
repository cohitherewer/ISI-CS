 IIMs unite to create a pool of independent directors

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT

 Calcutta, June 17: The IIMs in Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta and Lucknow and the Hyderabad-based Administrative Staff College of India are gearing up to ensure a steady flow of independent directors to India Inc.

 By amending clause 49 of the listing agreement, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has recently mandated that half of a companys board should comprise independent directors. 

 There is a dearth of independent directors and we are trying to bridge the gap by organising training programmes and conducting research on issues related to corporate governance, said N Balasubramanian, professor and chairman, centre for corporate governance and citizenship at IIM Bangalore. The four-year-old centre is the first of its kind in the country to take such initiatives. 

 Now, the government is also taking interest and initiatives are steered by the National Corporate Governance Foundation, set up by the ministry of company affairs along with contributions from the Confederation of Indian Industry, institutes of chartered accountants and company secretaries. The foundation is now in the process of accrediting various centres identified for teaching and research in the field of corporate governance.

 Training and research will be the primary objective. The areas that we will cover will include role of independent directors, transparency in corporate financial reporting and internal control system and its evaluation, said Asish Bhattacharyya, professor and in-charge of the centre at IIM Calcutta. Bhattacharyya was among the 30 representatives from South Asia that attended the trainers programme, organised by Global Corporate Governance Forum, an organisation sponsored by the World Bank and OECD, in Washington last month. 

 According to industry representatives, the biggest issue facing the industry today is that of independent directors for which the watchdog has set a December 31 deadline. Corporate India is debating over the number of independent directors as the J. J. Irani Committee has recommended that independent directors should not be more than 33 per cent of the board strength. 

 Since the objective is to facilitate availability of independent directors, we are also planning to come up with a register of independent directors, which the corporations can access to fill up vacancies on their boards, added Balasubramanian. 

 The real challenge, according to Balasubramanian, is to train the directors. Getting the directors to the training table is indeed a tough call. Our experience is that the quality of the programme content and its delivery are key determinants in attracting participation, said Balasubramanian. 

 But ensuring quality will be easier said than done as the issue of corporate governance is a new concept in India. 

 There has not been enough research on the subject and we need resources and encouragement from government to develop models that suit the Indian context, he summed up.

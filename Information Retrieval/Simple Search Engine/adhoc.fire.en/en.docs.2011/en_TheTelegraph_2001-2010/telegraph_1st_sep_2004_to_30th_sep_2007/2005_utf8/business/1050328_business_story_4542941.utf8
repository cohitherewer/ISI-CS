 Committee to iron out coal wage wrinkles

 New Delhi, March 27 (PTI): The group of ministers (GoM), headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, has formed a committee to sort out the contentious issues on the National Coal Wage Agreement Act and extend the act to sick PSUs like BCCL and ECL.

 The issues have been a bone of contention between the management of Coal India Limited and the Left-wing trade unions, representing about 4.5 lakh public sector coal workers. The coal unions have also been vociferously demanding 100 per cent neutralisation of dearness allowance. The National Coal Wage Agreement VII, which is under consideration, was applicable for a five-year period from 2001 to 2006, sources said.

 The GoM meeting was delayed because of two rounds of recent Assembly elections. The trade unions have been repeatedly demanding convening of the GoM meeting, saying that the grievances of the workers could not remain unaddressed for an indefinite period.

 Under intense pressure from the Left parties and the trade unions, the government has informed Parliament that it had no plans to re-introduce the Privatisation Of Coal Bill, 2000 and has also put the issue of privatisation of coal mines on a back burner.

 But the widening gap between demand and supply projection has compelled the government to ponder on expanding the base of coal mining operations by introducing more players equipped with latest technologies, sources said. 

 Currently, India?s total coal production is over 365 million tonnes (MT) and by the end of the Tenth Plan, there would be a shortfall of 55 MT, with supplies of 405 MT against a demand of 460 MT.

 As of now, captive coal mining is allowed in the private sector on a limited scale. Also, state-owned PSUs are allowed to undertake even commercial mining operations. However, the government was convinced that these measures would be inadequate to expand the domestic coal supply base commensurate with the projected rise in demand.

 Despite the recent duty cuts, there was been no considerable increase in the import of coal, owing to infrastructure bottlenecks. Also, landing cost of imported coal was higher than the price of domestic coal because of high ocean freight.

 Fitch wants tight grip on fiscal levers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 25: With the Union budget round the corner, Fitch Ratings today said implementation of a credible fiscal consolidation process would hasten India?s graduation to investment grade.

 The rating agency will be looking out for a more aggressive pace of fiscal consolidation in this budget than that implied by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act. 

 Fitch will also be watching out for a broadening of the tax base in line with the recommendations of the Kelkar Committee, implementation of a state-level VAT scheme, phasing out of subsidies, renewed impetus on privatisation and the liberalisation of foreign investment. 

 According to Shelly Shetty, senior director in Fitchs sovereign group, ?The weak state of Indias public finances represents the single most important constraint on its sovereign ratings: implementation of a credible fiscal consolidation process would hasten Indias graduation to investment grade.?

 At present, Fitch rates the countrys both long-term foreign currency and local currency sovereign debt issues at ?BB+? with a stable outlook. The short-term foreign currency rating is ?B?.

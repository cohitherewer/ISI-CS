 RCL offer at Rs 231

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 21: Anil Ambani today made an open offer to acquire 20 per cent of Reliance Capital Ltd at a price of Rs 231 per share.

 Anil had to make the open offer as he will acquire more than 15 per cent of Reliance Capitals equity following a preferential issue in which he will invest Rs 2,000 crore.

 However, the open offer is at a 20 per cent discount to the closing price of Reliance Capital at Rs 289.45 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today. The scrip opened at Rs 295 and rose to an intra-day high of Rs 300. It is, therefore, felt that the Reliance Capital shareholders may not be enthusiastic about the offer.

 The open offer has been made by AAA Enterprises Pvt Ltd, an Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprises group company. AAA Enterprises plans to acquire up to 5.14 crore shares, representing 20 per cent of the fully expanded equity capital of Reliance Capital. The offer will open on August 11 and close on August 30.

 Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, which is managing the offer, said Anil now holds 1.81 lakh shares of Reliance Capital, representing 0.14 per cent of its equity capital. While AAA Enterprises does not hold any shares in Reliance Capital, Tina Ambani, another director of AAA Enterprises, holds around 1.81 lakh shares.

 Anil holds a 98 per cent stake in AAA Enterprises with the balance being held by his immediate family members. Anil and Tina Ambani are the only directors of AAA Enterprises, which is yet to start operations. The company has a net worth of Rs 61,000.

 On June 19, the board of Reliance Capital had decided to issue and allot on a preferential basis around 6 crore shares at a price of Rs 228 apiece aggregating Rs 1368 crore and 4.10 crore warrants, entitling the warrant holder to apply for shares.

 As part of the financial arrangements made for the open offer, Anil has pledged 30 lakh shares of Reliance Industries having a price of Rs 630.50 apiece as on June 20. The acquirers have also made a cash deposit of Rs 13.50 crore with ICICI Bank. This is more than 1 per cent of the total consideration payable under the offer. 

 Reliance Capital is planning to be a diversified financial services powerhouse that straddles asset management, mutual funds, insurance and other services.

 Money raised through the preferential offer is expected to make Reliance Capital among the top three companies in the private financial services and banking sector.

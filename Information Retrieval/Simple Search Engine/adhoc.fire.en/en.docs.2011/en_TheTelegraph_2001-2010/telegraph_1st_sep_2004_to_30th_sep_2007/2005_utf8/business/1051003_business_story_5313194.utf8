 Reliance Energy in Orissa flap

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Oct. 2: Reliance Energy has refused to renew the shareholders agreement with the Orissa government after taking over three distribution companies ? Nesco, Southco and Wesco ? from the management control of BSES. The agreement with the three companies expired on April 1, 2004 and should have been renewed by now.

 This raises fears of 2001, when the US-based AES Corporation had exited from Orissas Central Electricity Supply Company, blaming adverse business climate in the state.

 The non-renewal of shareholders agreement was brought to the notice of the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC) by Sarat Chandra Mohanty, the president of Nikhila Orissa Bidyut Shramik Mahasangh. On September 3, Mohanty filed a petition before the OERC seeking cancellation of the licence of Reliance Energy. He said in his petition the company did not invest in the improvement of customer service in the state during the last six-and-a-half years, even as it had pumped huge amounts into Delhi.

 Sources said REL has not only refused to abide by any agreement but has also informed OERC that it does not come under the commissions purview. Such defiance by Reliance Energy may not go down well with the OERC and may affect the talks on the firms Rs 12000-crore thermal power project planned at Hirma in Jharsuguda district, they added.

 Reliance Energy, which still owes Rs 1,800 crore to Gridco in arrears, has not serviced interest on the Rs 400-crore bond pledged to the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC). The company has also refused to service the bond, which started maturing on October 1.

 Before Reliance Energy took over the management of the three district distribution companies, BSES in 2001 had issued bonds worth Rs 400 crore at a 12.5 per cent interest in favour of Gridco to cover its arrear dues. Gridco, while securitising its past dues of Rs 1,102 crore to NTPC, had pledged the BSES bonds to the national power company. After taking over the BSES management, Reliance Energy is bound by the shareholders agreement to service the bonds on time.

 According to the repayment schedule, redemption was to start from October 1. The bonds will be fully redeemed on October 1, 2007. Although Reliance Energy was supposed to pay Rs 120 crore (30 per cent redemption) to Gridco on Friday, the company has failed to do so. The Rs 120-crore interest on the bond has also not been cleared.

 The company did not submit its business plan to the OERC, but agreed on it after intervention by the commission. Although the OERC approved business plans setting long-term objectives for the three distribution firms, Reliance Energy challenged the order before the energy appellate tribunal.

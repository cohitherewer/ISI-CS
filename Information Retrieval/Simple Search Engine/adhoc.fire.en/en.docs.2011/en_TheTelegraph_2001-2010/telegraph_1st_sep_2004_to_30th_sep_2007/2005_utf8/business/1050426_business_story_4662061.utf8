 Asim sees way out of VAT maze

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dasgupta: Almost there

 New Delhi, April 25: The empowered committee on VAT today informally decided to impose a minimum of 20 per cent tax on diesel. However, the exact amount will be decided over the next few days. The committee will also take a call on other items where state tax levels vary.

 The committee, which met state sales tax commissioners and other officials today, will firm up some of the decisions by tomorrow. 

 ?I am optimistic,?committee chairman Asim Dasgupta said here today. 

 Dasgupta said variations in VAT rates were not very significant but the issue was high on the agenda of the meeting.

 ?We are collecting information from all 20 states (that have implemented VAT so far) and we will discuss it tomorrow,? Dasgupta said. 

 This meeting was held because of confusion over varying rates and fears that states would lose revenue due to higher rates. 

 Delhi has lost considerable revenue as it has imposed a 20 per cent tax on diesel, while neighbouring Haryana continues to tax it at 12 per cent.

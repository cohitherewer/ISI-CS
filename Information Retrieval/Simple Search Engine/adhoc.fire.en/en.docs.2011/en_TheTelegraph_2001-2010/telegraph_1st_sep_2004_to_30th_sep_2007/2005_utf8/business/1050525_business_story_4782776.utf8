 Mumbai, May 24: The government is working to set up an international diamond centre, Union minister of commerce and industry Kamal Nath said.

 It will also facilitate joint ventures between local entrepreneurs and overseas businesses in different fields.

 Nath, who inaugurated the International Diamond Conference ? Mines to Market 2005, said his ministry is working closely with the industry to develop an international trading centre in India as the country is the largest purchaser of diamond roughs.

 There is no reason why we should not have a diamond trading centre on a par with those in Belgium, Israel and Dubai, Nath said. 

 The centre will be set up by the end of the current year, he added. The minister, however, did not specify the location of the proposed project.

 As India is the largest consumer of diamond roughs and its continued supply is crucial, the government is now open to the idea of entering into economic co-operation agreements with other countries, particularly those of Africa, which produce the commodity. 

 During his recent visit to Australia, Nath also had talks with the Western Australia Premier regarding the continued supply of diamond roughs to India.

 Nath alluded to the phenomenal growth in exports in the gems and jewellery sector over the years. 

 From a modest figure of barely $25 million 30 years ago, it has grown to $15 billion a year at present. It now accounts for 18 per cent of our total exports, and is next only to textiles as a merchandise foreign exchange earner.

 The government has set a target of $92 billion for merchandise export during the current financial year, Nath said on the sidelines. 

 However, he was quick to add that the high trade deficit seen in April is not a matter of concern.

 We have set a merchandise export target of $92 billion for this fiscal and are hoping that the total global engagement of the Indian economy touches the $500 billion mark, the minister said. 

 Indias total merchandise export was $80 billion in the last financial year. 

 The minister is optimistic regarding trade deficit as, according to him, the economy is on the right track.

 Scramble to defuse FII bombshell

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Reddy: Capped words

 Mumbai, Jan. 12: The government scrambled tonight to defuse a bombshell from Reserve Bank (RBI) governor Y. V. Reddy, who is reported to have suggested regulating and, even taxing, foreign fund inflows.

 The tremors reached Delhi, where finance minister P. Chidambaram stepped into the damage-control drill with a clarification that the governor?s remarks had been ?misunderstood?. ?These ideas have been rejected in the past. They have no place even now,? he told a TV channel.

 The minister said he spoke to the RBI governor, who insisted that his comments had been interpreted in a way that was the opposite of what he intended to say. Reddy claimed to have said that taxing FIIs was ?not effective? at all.

 The RBI chief followed this up with an impromptu press conference late this evening where he said ?FII caps were not desirable? ? retracting from his statement earlier in the day.

 Launching a research report earlier in the day, the RBI governor spoke of the central bank seeing a ?scope for enhancing the quality of FII inflows?. Reddy peppered his overview of the economy while releasing the India Development Report 2004-05 with comments that large FII inflows were causing volatility in the market ? and there was a need to impose taxes on them. 

 ?The Reserve Bank governor?s statement can spook the markets when trading resumes on Thursday,? said a broker. 

 Bankers, however, stood by Reddy, saying his remarks should be seen in the context of the huge gyrations in the forex and stock markets. They pointed to the swings in rupee and dollar values over the past week. 

 For stock markets, which have seen $8.5 billion (Rs 38,965 crore) of FII money pour in last year, every Reddy clarification counts. Those who have been delighted to watch the sensex race 13 per cent will thank him too.

 ?Our emphasis in the management of capital account has been on external debt, as recommended by the Rangarajan Committee more than a decade ago. However, there are several reasons for exploring an active management of non-debt flows at this stage,? Reddy said.

 What he said after this has left market nerves frayed. ?The magnitude of FDI/ FII is large and volatility has, perhaps, increased. The impact of such flows on the stock markets is discernible, but perhaps less evident at this juncture in corporate ownership and control.?

 ?First, a view needs to be taken on the quantity and quality of FII flows. While quotas or ceilings, as practised by some countries, may not be desirable, there is merit in our keeping such an option open and exercising it selectively, as needed, after due notice to FIIs,? he added.

 Reddy explained that price-based measures, such as taxes, could be examined, though their effectiveness was debatable. 

 What set alarm bells ringing was his comment that there is ?scope for enhancing quality of flows through a review of policies relating to eligibility for registration as FIIs and assessment of risks involved in flows from hedge funds, participatory notes and sub-accounts?. 

 Reddy said strict adherence to ?know-your-investor? principle, especially in the case of money coming from tax-havens, would help in checking volatality.

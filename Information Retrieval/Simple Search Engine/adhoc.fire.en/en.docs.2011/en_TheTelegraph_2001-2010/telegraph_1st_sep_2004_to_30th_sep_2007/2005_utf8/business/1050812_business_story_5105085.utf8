 Paswan in SAIL duel

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Aug. 11: SAIL and steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan are on collision course ? and the bone of contention is the companys commercial director, S. K. Rungta.

 Rungta, on long leave after the minister appointed committees to look into allegations of irregularities in coal purchases, rejoined after an order was passed last week appointing Salem Steels executive director, M. Roy, in his place.

 Rungtas return created a piquant situation: SAIL executives did not know who would run the Rs 32,000-crore firms marketing division. Roy, believed to have been hand-picked by the minister, could not take up his new job as SAIL today came out with a fresh order asking Rungta to continue; Roy has been told to assume his old charge. 

 Paswan is believed to be unhappy about the entire incident. It is the ministry which decided that Rungta should continue. We cant refuse him his job now that he has joined back. What can I do? SAIL chairman V. S. Jain said.

 Steel ministry bureaucrats are believed to have backed SAIL on the issue, arguing that Rungta should return. However, this has created an unprecedented situation of confrontation between the ministers office and SAIL. 

 Rungtas troubles began when several MPs wrote to Paswan, raising questions on the spot coal purchases made last year by SAIL, which saw its Australian suppliers halt consignments on the ground that their mines were flooded.

 The mine flooding had triggered severe coal shortages at SAIL plants, forcing the steel major to resort to rationing till it booked feedstock through spot purchases.

 A committee comprising Rungta, other SAIL directors and joint secretaries from the ministry made purchase decisions. However, after Paswan ordered an investigation on the basis of the MPs letters, Rungta alone went on leave as he was the principal functionary. 

 Sources said the SAIL top brass and ministry officials had already received the blessings of the Prime Ministers Office before taking the step. Their point is that no specific wrong-doing has been found in the coal deals.

 Meanwhile, SAIL has also appointed Durgapur steel plant executive director Nilotpal Roy as managing director of IISCO, which has now been merged with SAIL.

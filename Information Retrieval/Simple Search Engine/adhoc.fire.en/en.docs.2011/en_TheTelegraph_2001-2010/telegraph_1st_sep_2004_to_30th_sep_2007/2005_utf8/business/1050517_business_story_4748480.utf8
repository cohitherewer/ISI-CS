 Bongaigaon merger on IOC agenda

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Behuria: Looking ahead

 New Delhi, May 16: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) is contemplating to merge profit making Bongaigaon refinery unit with itself. Bongaigaon Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd (BRPL) is a subsidiary of IOC.

 The IOC board of directors might move a proposal to merge BRPL with IOC. However, this is not being done in a hurry and may take about six months time, said IOC chairman S Behuria.

 Riding on an improved refinery margin of $ 8.5 per barrel, BRPL has registered a 57 per cent increase in its net profit at Rs 478 crore for the financial year ended March 31, 2005. The company had recorded a net profit of Rs 304 crore in 2003-04.

 Declaring the results here today, Behuria said BRPL processed a record 2.31 million tonnes (MT) of crude during the year, utilising 98 per cent of its refining capacity. In the previous year, the company had refined 2.13 mt of crude while earning a refinery margin of $ 5.2 per barrel. 

 He added the refinerys turnover has increased by 56 per cent to Rs 4,992 crore. BRPL has declared a dividend of Rs 6 per share. Together with the 60 per cent interim dividend declared earlier, the total dividend for 2004-05 works out to 120 per cent. 

 This dividend will be payable subject to the approval of the shareholders at the forthcoming annual general meeting of the company, Behuria added.

 BRPL managing director A. K. Sarmah said the company has drawn up plans to invest Rs 800 crore for setting up a diesel hydro-treatment plant and upgrade the refinery to meet Bharat stage III emission norms for petrol and diesel which would come into effect from 2010. 

 The quality upgradation project would include naphtha production as well. Sarmah said the two projects would be financed mainly from internal resources. 

 Apart from these two major projects, BRPL is also implementing some small projects for modernising and revamping certain units. 

 BRPL processes 1.3 mt of sweet crude from Ravva oilfields in the eastern offshore and around 1 mt of Assam crude. 

 Diesel production from high-quality Ravva crude meets the Bharat stage II emission norms, but that from the Assam crude does not.

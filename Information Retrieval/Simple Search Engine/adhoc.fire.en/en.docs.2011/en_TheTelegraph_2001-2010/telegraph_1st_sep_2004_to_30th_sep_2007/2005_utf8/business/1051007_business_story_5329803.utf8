 Local retail firms signal FDI go-slow

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 One by one

 Mumbai, Oct. 6: Local retailers led by Kishore Biyani of Pantaloon today urged the government to allow foreign investment into the sector in a phased manner even as the Centre steps up efforts to open the FDI door.

 The organised sector of retail, of which Biyani?s company is a part, wants FDI to be first allowed in less sensitive sectors like garments and lifestyle products. They are not averse to FDI in smaller cities initially, but would like a lead-time of at least three years ? to invest more ? before global retail giants are ushered in.

 The infusion is expected to put Indian retailers on a stronger footing and create a level-playing field against deep-pocketed adversaries like Wal-Mart and Carrefour.

 Biyani, who chairs a CII committee on retailing, made it clear that the chamber was not debating whether India should allow FDI ? but its manner and timing.

 Home-grown retailers want the flow of overseas capital to be a gradual process so that local players have the time to catch up. ?Every country protected its retail industry. Even China allowed FDI when its domestic firms acquired critical mass. Some other Asian countries have had negative experiences, the kind where the FDI wave has sunk domestic chains,? Biyani said.

 Krish Iyer, CEO of Piramyd Retail, whose IPO will hit the market soon, wants FDI to be initially allowed in less sensitive sectors. These include garments, lifestyle products, house-ware and entertainment. Food and groceries can join the list of eligible items after a few years.

 According to Iyer, around 280 malls are now under construction, soaking up an investment of Rs 8,000-10,000 crore.

 He pointed out that a key constraint for many retailers, particularly the unlisted ones, is that investment from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and venture capital entities is not permitted. Existing regulations do not even allow FIIs to subscribe to retail IPOs.

 ?FIIs and venture capital firms hold a long-term view. Allowing FII, venture capital investments will allow domestic retailers to access cheap funds,? Iyer added.

 The local retail industry is valued at an estimated Rs 9,30,000 crore. Of this, the organised sector is worth Rs 35,000 crore, though these firms largely concentrate on urban areas. They are expected to grow at 12-20 per cent. 

 Existing policies allow international brands through various routes such as franchise, joint ventures or cash-and-carry trading.

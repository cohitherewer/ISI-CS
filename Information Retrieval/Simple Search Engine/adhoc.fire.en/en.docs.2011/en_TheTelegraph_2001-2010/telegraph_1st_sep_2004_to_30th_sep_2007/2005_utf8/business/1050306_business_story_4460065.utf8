 Toyota to break even next fiscal

 New Delhi, March 5 (PTI): Five years after it entered the Indian car market, Toyota Kirloskar Motors today said it would be breaking even next fiscal even as it expects a double digit growth in revenues for the year ended March 31, 2005.

 ?We expect to wipe out our accumulated losses by next fiscal and achieve break-even,? Toyota Kirloskar Motor managing director Atsushi Toyoshima said here.

 The company has so far invested Rs 1,400 crore in the Indian market. Actual sales began in the year 2000, though the company was set up in 1997.

 Toyoshima said the company?s turnover was expected to be up by over 10 per cent this fiscal over last year?s Rs 2,700 crore.

 The company, which last month phased out its flagship Qualis model with the Innova, said sales this calendar year are expected to be up 28.8 per cent to 58,000 units; the Innova accounting for a major chunk of 45,000 units.

 The sedan Corolla is expected to chip in 12,000 units while the Camry around 1,000.

 Toyoshima said within days of the launch of the Innova, 7,000 bookings had been made. 

 ?We are encouraged by this and expect the model to not only cater to the passenger car segment but the multi-purpose vehicle segment as well,? he said.

 The company?s current dealer network in India is 44 which is expected to rise to 60 by the end of this year. 

Small car

 Toyota is carrying out a study to introduce a model in the mass volume small car segment, which could include a car from the Daihatsu stable.

 ?In order to achieve a 10 per cent market share by 2010, we will definitely look into some models smaller than the mid-size Corolla,? Toyoshima said.

 He said the study, to identify the compact car model to be introduced in India, was still on. ?We have not concluded it yet,? he added.

 The company expects the Indian car market to grow to two million units by 2010 and double to four million units by 2015.

 Asked how it planned to tackle competition in the already-crowded small car segment, he said, ?whatever offer we will make, the model will have a unique feature.?

 He said that the company had the benefit of a large number of distinct models in the compact car segment, with group company Daihatsu being strong in the segment.

 He, however, refused to specify any time-frame for the proposed launch in the compact car segment.

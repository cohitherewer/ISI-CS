 BoB net profit drops 77% to Rs 70 crore

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 29: A fall in treasury income saw Bank of Baroda?s bottomline taking a hit during the third quarter of the current financial year. Net profit during the period fell to Rs 69.50 crore, down 77 per cent, from Rs 306.95 crore in the same period of the last financial year.

 For the nine-month period, the bank posted a net profit of Rs 575.80 crore, a 29 per cent drop over Rs 810.98 crore during the corresponding period last year. 

 BoB said treasury income by way of sale of investments was lower by 29 per cent at Rs 486.76 crore during the April-December period as against Rs 687.37 crore last year. This was primarily due to volatility in interest rates as a result of international oil price shock.

 Total income at Rs 5,707.29 crore for the nine months was lower by Rs 105.79 crore compared with Rs 5,813.08 crore during the same period last year. This was largely on account of a fall in other income which decreased by 12.05 per cent to Rs 1,038.35 crore during the first nine months from Rs 1,180.62 crore in the same period of the previous year due to a decline in profits on the sale of investments. 

 However, net interest income, excluding extra-ordinary items, grew by Rs 257.02 crore to Rs 2,089.64 crore in the nine-month period ended December 2004 from Rs 1,832.62 crore in the same period last year, registering a rise of 14 per cent. 

 Similarly, on a quarterly basis, net interest income increased by 12.03 per cent to Rs 728.28 crore. BoB said advances, domestic and overseas combined, increased by a hefty 19 per cent to Rs 39,538.77 crore as on December 31, 2004 from Rs 33,348.75 crore as on December 31, 2003.

 Of these, domestic advances increased by 17.53 per cent to Rs 32,066.27 crore (Rs 27,282.50 crore last year) as on December 31, 2004.

 Retail lending increased 31.76 per cent to Rs 4,864.85 crore from Rs 3,692.09 crore.

 The bank said retail credit now forms 15.17 per cent of total domestic advances. 

 On non-performing assets, BoB said net NPAs went down to Rs 821.09 crore as on December 31, 2004 from Rs 1,128.77 crore as December 31, 2003, a substantial reduction of 27 per cent. 

 As a percentage of total advances, net NPAs declined from 3.46 per cent to 2.11 per cent. Gross NPAs also declined sharply by Rs 604.20 crore during the period now constituting 8.31 per cent of total advances.

 During the nine-month period, provisions and contingencies increased by 82 per cent to Rs 908.63 crore (Rs 498.38 crore). However, provisions for NPAs showed a reduction by around 60 per cent to Rs 254.58 crore (Rs 630.97 crore) on account of lower slippages in advances portfolio during the period under consideration.

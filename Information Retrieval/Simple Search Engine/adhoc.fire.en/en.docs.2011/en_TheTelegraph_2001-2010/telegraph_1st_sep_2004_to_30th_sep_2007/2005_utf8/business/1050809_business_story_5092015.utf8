 Oil firms turn to PM

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Aug. 8: The petroleum ministry has turned to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to bail out the beleaguered oil companies. Finance minister P. Chidambaram has refused to budge on the tax structure, imposing a crushing burden on oil firms. 

 As the political compulsions of the government cannot allow for more than a modest increase in the prices of petroleum products, the distorted tax structure will have to be rationalised to ease the burden on the oil companies, a senior petroleum ministry official told The Telegraph. 

 Given the sensitive nature of the issue, it is likely to be taken up after the monsoon session of Parliament, he added.

 Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and IBP expect to bleed by another Rs 2,800 crore during the current fiscal as the finance ministry is refusing to roll back the decision to increase the duties on petrol and diesel introduced in the budget. 

 Oil companies were not allowed to pass on these imposts to the consumer. 

 IOC alone will lose Rs 1,150 crore on this account; Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum will together be drained of an equal amount. 

 The basic price of petrol and diesel, excluding duties and taxes, works out to Rs 17.40 and Rs 18.42 per litre, respectively. The rest is made up of central levies and state taxes. As a result, the consumer ends up paying over Rs 40 per litre for petrol and close to Rs 30 per litre for diesel. 

 Senior petroleum ministry officials are of the view that it is essential to scale down the high levies on petroleum goods to minimise the impact of skyrocketing international oil prices on the consumer.

 The Indian basket of crude imports now costs $58 per barrel, which is a whopping $6 per barrel higher than the price in June, when fuel rates were last raised. 

 Since all the oil marketing companies have plunged into the red, they do not have the capacity to bear this crushing burden any longer.

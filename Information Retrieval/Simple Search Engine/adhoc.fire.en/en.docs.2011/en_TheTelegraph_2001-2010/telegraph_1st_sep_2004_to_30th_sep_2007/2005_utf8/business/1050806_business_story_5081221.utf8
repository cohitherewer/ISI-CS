 Haldia shares stay with IOC

 OUR BUREAU

 Purnendu: Wait and watch

 Calcutta/New Delhi Aug. 5: The company law board (CLB) today upheld the allotment of 7.5 per cent fresh equity to Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) in Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL), while restraining the company from issuing shares to financial institutions until it takes a final decision in the case. 

 Under Haldia Petrochems debt recast package, debt worth Rs 135 crore has to be converted into equity by issuing shares to FIs. 

 In the interim order, CLB chairman S. Balasubramanian said even after the allotment to IOC, The Chatterjee Group (TCG) would continue to hold majority 53 per cent stake in HPL.

 I do not propose to put any fetters on the right of IOC on the shares other than stipulating that the impugned allotment shall be subject to the final order on the petition, he said in the interim order.

 I further direct that the status quo of the shareholding should be maintained as of today, he added.

 In its petition, TCG had alleged that the share allotment to IOC was an attempt to turn it into a minority in Haldia Petrochem. TCG added that if more shares were allotted to financial institutions, it would become a minority. 

 Keeping this plea in mind, the CLB chairman has deferred the allotment of shares worth Rs 135 crore to lenders under the corporate debt restructuring package (CDR) approved by IDBI.

 The development seems to be a mixed bag for both TCG and the Bengal government.

 Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen and TCG chairman Purnendu Chatterjee sounded pleased with the development. 

 I am not displeased with the order, Purnendu told The Telegraph.

 The judge has asked the company to produce certain facts before him. Let it come, then we will see, he said.

 Purnendu said he has confidence in the judiciary. I am hopeful of a positive outcome once the facts are produced before the CLB, he added.

 Sen also expressed his happiness that the CLB did not stay the allotment of shares to IOC. 

 It is a good decision, he said. However, he refused to comment on the fact that shares cannot be issued to lenders as directed by IDBI in a letter to HPL on August 2, 2005.

 The matter is sub-judice. All I can say is that it is strange that objections have been raised on the issuance of shares to IOC and lenders. These processes are part of the CDR package and we are only implementing it, Sen said.

 Government sources claimed that the premise that TCG was a majority shareholder in the company was inaccurate. The state, along with the Tatas and IOC, holds more than 55 per cent, they said, adding the matter would be made clear before the CLB soon.

 ONGC steps on the gas in discoveries

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Drill frill

 New Delhi, May 5: ONGC has discovered three new oil and gas fields ? one in the shallow waters on the country?s west coast and two in the deep waters of the Krishna Godavri (KG) basin on the east coast.

 ?An estimate of the in-place reserves of oil and gas will be made only after more appraisal wells are drilled. But according to current indications, these are healthy reserves,? a senior ONGC official told The Telegraph.

 ONGC said it had made a ?significant? oil and gas find at a location 60 km south-west of Mumbai High. The well was spudded on October 20 last year at a depth of 82 metres and drilled to 3, 949 metres. Multiple oil amp; gas-bearing sands have been identified in what is called the Panna formation. 

 Testing of two objects is complete. The deeper object is producing 490,376 cubic metres of gas per day and 2,491 barrels of oil. The shallower object has flowed 451,838 cubic metres of gas per day and 2, 045 barrels of oil. The oil and gas are reported to be of high quality.

 According to ONGC, this find has opened up a new exploration opportunity in the Panna formation, off Mumbai High. On the east coast, ONGC has made two more gas strikes in its ongoing Sagar Samriddhi deep water exploration campaign. Well VA-2 in block KG-OS-DW-IV at a location 35 km off Amalaupram coast, was spudded on March 24, 2005 in 689 metres water depth targeting potential meandering channels. 

 The well has been dug to a depth of 2, 614 metres; its thickness is 17 metres. After completion, the well produced 326,545 cubic meters of gas per day. 

 This prospect will be integrated to up-scaled exploitation plan of G-1 and GS-15 structures where ONGC is developing Indias first digital oil field in KG basin.

 On the second location in KG offshore, ONGCs drillship, Sagar Vijay, has been third time lucky. Well G4-4, under drilling at a depth of 331 meters, is located 38 km from Amalapuram coast. 

 The three blocks where the discoveries have been made are owned and operated by ONGC and were given to the company before the new exploration licensing policy (Nelp) was introduced.

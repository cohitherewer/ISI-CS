 June date set for 3G mobiles

 Cutting edge 

 New Delhi, April 26: The third generation (3G) service will roll out in India by June.

 3G is a generic term used for the next generation of mobile communications systems. 

 Communication minister Dayanidhi Maran made the first test call for 3G services in India at a cellular summit which opened here today. 

 The new service will allow high-speed streaming downloads on mobile phones, enabling a user to watch video and movie clips, a live cricket match and even trade on the stock market using real-time price information.

 The 3G enabled mobile phone can offer a speed of 384 kilobits per second (kbps) that will allow streaming videos and the download of a three-hour movie in 20 to 30 minutes over these mobiles. At present, in India, the maximum speed that is offered by mobile operators is 177 kbps using the Enhanced Data Rate for Global Evolution (EDGE) technology.

 ?Most mobile subscribers do not use 3G today, but this will change. With migration to 3G, they will discover value-added services they want and are willing to pay for,? Maran said.

 In urban areas, 3G could congest voice since spectrum crunch is seriously affecting quality of mobile services. Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd has floated a 3G tender and BSNL has initiated a pilot project for a similar plan.

 ?The higher voice capacity of 3G would enable delivery of cheaper voice services which could drive penetration of mobile phones in rural areas. It would also facilitate government initiatives like e-education, e-medicine and e-governance,? said Maran.

 Earlier, Sunil Mittal, chairman and group managing director of Bharti, pointed to the hurdles in expanding the mobile networks to cover more areas. He highlighted the stubborn attitude of BSNL in not sharing its infrastructure. He also cited the high inter-connect user charges.

 BSNL chairman and managing director A.K Sinha said, ?We (BSNL) are in a maturing stage in the cellular mobile telephony market. The point of sharing infrastructure can be undertaken at a later stage.? BSNL feels its large network is its unique selling proposition and cannot be opened to private rivals, Maran said.

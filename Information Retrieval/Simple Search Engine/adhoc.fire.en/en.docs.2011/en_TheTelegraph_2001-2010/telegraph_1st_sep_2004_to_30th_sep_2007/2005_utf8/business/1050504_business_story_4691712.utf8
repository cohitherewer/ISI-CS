 Calcutta, May 3: Birla VXL?s manufacturing unit for the OCM brand will be sold this financial year as part of a debt recast exercise initiated by Arcil.

 Asset Reconstruction Company India Limited (Arcil) had taken over a major part of Birla VXL?s Rs 432-crore debt.

 The OCM division in Amritsar can produce 8.4 m metres of suiting material. Birla VXL?s Digjam and OCM brands together command a 30-35 per cent share of the domestic suitings market. The company is owned by S. K. Birla.

 ?We will sell assets of 10-12 companies this fiscal, including a couple of textile firms. We are scouting for buyers for the OCM facility of Birla VXL. The company has become financially weak over the past four to five years,? S. Khasnobis, president amp; COO of Arcil, told The Telegraph. 

 Arcil has on its list 10-15 investment bankers, including SBI Caps.

 The market is rife with the rumour that Raymond is keen to take over the OCM unit. However, Khasnobis refused to name any bidder.

 Arcil acquired sticky assets worth Rs 15,368 crore till March 31, 2005. It has taken over dues of 157 cases, which amounts to Rs 3,514 crore, from 12 banks and financial institutions in March alone.

 Out of the dues acquired, the term loan portion is 72 per cent and the balance is working capital.

 Of the 143 accounts acquired by Arcil from working capital lenders, State Bank of India?s share is Rs 954 crore (from 110 accounts), which represents about 68 per cent of the dues acquired in value terms.

 Khasnobis said the banks (working capital lenders) that have sold their NPAs to Arcil have a strong capital base. ?Banks with a weak capital base have low provisioning coverage. They cannot take a hit on the profit and loss account due to the difference between high book value and very low realisable value.

 Arcil has so far acquired Rs 4415 crore working capital loans and Rs 10,955 crore term loans. Average pricing for working capital loans was 15 per cent and for term loans it was 27 per cent. Average acquisition price offered by Arcil works out to 24 per cent.

 Khasnobis expects business to pick up with the introduction of Basel II norms in 2006-07 and the recent RBI stipulation of 100 per cent provisioning over three years. ?The banks will be compelled to sell NPAs from 2006-07,? he added.

 Boost for crop cover

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 21: The Agriculture Insurance Company (AIC) is exploring the reinsurance market to increase the capacity for crop insurance in the country.

 We seek reinsurance protection for the slew of products we aim to launch for the farmers in the next couple of months as well as for the government-supported national agriculture insurance scheme, AIC chairman cum managing director Suparas Bhandari said.

 The AIC top brass has met major reinsurance companies, including Swiss Re, Munich Re, GE Frankona Re, Hannover Re, and QBE, last month to work this out.

 Besides, AIC officials are also working in close co-ordination with the World Bank to finalise details of the technical assistance project extended to AIC by the World Bank on crop insurance pricing methodology.

 Bhandari said AIC will soon unveil three insurance products, including one for wheat, in the coming rabi season, while it plans to introduce products on tea, rubber and sugarcane by the middle of next year.

 Three crop insurance products, including an exclusive one for wheat crops, will be introduced in the coming rabi season, he said.

 AIC will also launch insurance products for poppy and mango in 2005.

 Wheat insurance will become operational by early next year when the crop starts maturing, said Bhandari.

 The products relating to both mango and wheat will be linked to technological inputs provided by satellite images.

 AIC would mainly target the wheat growers from Punjab and Haryana who are not covered under any price support scheme.

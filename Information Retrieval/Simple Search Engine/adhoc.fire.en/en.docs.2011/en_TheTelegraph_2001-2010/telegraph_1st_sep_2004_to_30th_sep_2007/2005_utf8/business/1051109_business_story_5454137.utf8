 Over 20% growth in exports expected

 OUR SEPCIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Nov. 8: Indian exports are poised to grow more than 20 per cent in dollar terms for the second year in a row, director-general of foreign trade K.T. Chacko said here today. 

 Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the CII sponsored national conference on export excellence, Chacko said the efforts were afoot to shift from a regime of duty reduction to one of duty refunds to usher in the WTO era. 

 He said DGFT would pursue a dialogue with the state governments in the middle of this month to arrive at a workable model for promoting exports. 

 Chacko said he expected the impact of recent slide of rupee against dollar to be quite good for Indias exporters.

 Lot of capital goods and raw material imports are flowing into the country, indicating a buoyancy that would galvanise exports, he explained.

 Chacko added that the efforts were to bring about an EDI network of all 13 transport community partners to facilitate the exporters.

 In the next 6 to 12 months at least the Customs and the DGFT will be on the EDI, he said. Underlining the urgent need for changes in the value-added tax, petroluem and electicity costs in exports in line with the WTO era, he noted, several central duty schemes which hitherto did not affect the imports were also under the WTO scanner. 

 Both the DGFT and the state governments should jointly develop a mechanism to refund duties to exporters as an incentive to bolster Indias share in the global export market, Chacko emphasised. 

 Inaugurating the conference chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy said a mega chemical complex has been panned for Vishakapatnam in partnership with the Centre. The government will provide for 15,000 acres for the project, which will be set up in the next three years.

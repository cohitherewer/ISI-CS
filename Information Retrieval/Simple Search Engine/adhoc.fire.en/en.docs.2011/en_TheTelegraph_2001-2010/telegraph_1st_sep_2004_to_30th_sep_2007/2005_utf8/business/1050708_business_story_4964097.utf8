 Alcatel to share technology with ITI

 M. RAJENDRAN

 Mankapur (UP), July 7: Alcatel plans to invest 400-500 million euro in India to make mobile base stations, digital subscriber link, Wi-max and Wi-Fi products and set up a research and development centre, communications minister Dayanidhi Maran said at the inauguration of a GSM mobile phone equipment manufacturing facility at ITI, Mankapur.

 Digital subscriber link (DSL) is a medium for broadband-based services like TV, video and phone on a single line. The Wi-Fi and Wi-max systems use low spectrum (airwaves) to transfer voice and data. 

 The French telecom company has delivered its first consignment of GSM equipment to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd. The company said it would share the technology with ITI Ltd.

 Alcatel chairman and chief executive officer Serge Tchuruk said, India is a strategic market and the transfer of technology is a part of our commitment to the country. 

 Mankapur, where a state-run telecom equipment manufacturing unit existed, will be one of the biggest base for making telecom base stations (based on the GSM technology) globally, he added.

 Announcing the revival of the ailing Mankapur unit, Tchuruk said, India can change into an export centre for telecom equipment from being an importer.

 Maran said the policies of the UPA government has helped attract telecom makers to the country. The revival of sick public sector units like ITI, Manakpur was an UPA commitment, he added.

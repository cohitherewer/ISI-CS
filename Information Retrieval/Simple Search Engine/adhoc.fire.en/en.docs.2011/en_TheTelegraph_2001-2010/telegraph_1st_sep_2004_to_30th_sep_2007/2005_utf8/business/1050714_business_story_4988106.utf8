The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Bengal revenue mopup rises 17.5%

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 13: Bengal has recorded a 17.5 per cent growth in revenue collection in June under the value-added tax (VAT) regime.

 State finance minister Asim Dasgupta said the revenue went up from Rs 405 crore in June 2004 to Rs 475 crore same time this year, beating the average of 15 per cent witnessed in 21 states where VAT was introduced in April.

 Moreover, the growth has surpassed the five-year June average of 10.5 per cent in Bengal.

 Dasgupta, who revealed these figures in the Assembly today, attributed the development to the widening of the tax base.

 Registration by traders has shot up to 1,30,000 from 70,000 recorded during the sales tax regime.

 The initial resistance is wearing thin, he said.

 Asked if a similar growth rate can be maintained in the coming months, Dasgupta told The Telegraph that the pace of new registration should be sustained to attain a healthy growth in revenue collection.

 The minister, however, ignored the effect of the first two months (April-May) on the grounds that they were not comparable with last year.

 April relates to March of last fiscal, whereas in May, trade was affected because of agitation by traders. So June is the only month that can be compared, he argued.

 Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay, a Trinamool Congress MLA, sought to dismiss the claim of revenue growth by Dasgupta. 

 Quoting the argument of former finance minister Ashok Mitra, he said the collection grew by 14 per cent in 2003-04 and 15 per cent in 2004-05 in the earlier sales tax regime.

 So Dasguptas claim that VAT helped increased revenue collection is not right, Chattopadhyay said.

 Dasgupta said prices have softened in the state after VAT. The consumer price index has gone down in May.

 Newgen logs on to eastern region

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, May 28: Newgen Software Technologies, a business process management (BPM) company, has started operations in the city with an eye on tapping the potential in the eastern region.

 The Delhi-based company has already bagged orders from ITC, WBIDC and Magma Leasing and is currently in parleys with the city-based banks for document management projects.

 Says Punit Jain, vice president, sales and marketing, Newgen Software, ?Over the last one year, the eastern region has shown a great business potential, particularly in the BPM segment. We have commenced sales operations in Calcutta and are talking to 20 other potential customers in this part of the country.?

 BPM helps companies manage content throughout the organisation by automating and streamlining their business processes and simplifying their critical and everyday decision-making. Globally, BPM is a $15-billion industry and is estimated at Rs 200 crore in India. The segment is expected to grow two-fold in the next 4-5 years.

 With cheque truncation soon to be implemented by banks in line with the RBI guidelines, Newgen also expects to get clients from their ranks. ?In fact, we are in talks with major banks in the region,? said Jain. ?If the projects are rolled out, we?ll have to set up support systems in the city to facilitate our business growth in this region.?

 Currently, the company has two development centres in Delhi and Chennai.

 ?We have also completed the first phase of the document management project for WBIDC which looks after file movement and tracks them,? says Jain. ?The state industrial development agency has digitised its application procedures and has minimised procedural delays. Later, this may be extended to other applications.?

 Newgen also plans to focus on sectors such as insurance, telecom, e-governance, business process outsourcing and manufacturing.

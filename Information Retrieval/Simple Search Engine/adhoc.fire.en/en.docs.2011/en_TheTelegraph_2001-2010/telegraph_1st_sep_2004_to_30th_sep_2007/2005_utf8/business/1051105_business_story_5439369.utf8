 Greenspan renews inflation alert

 Washington, Nov. 4 (Reuters): The US economy has weathered the blow from recent devastating hurricanes and still has good momentum, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said on Tuesday, though inflation risks are a worry.

 The economic fundamentals remain firm, and the US economy appears to retain important forward momentum, Greenspan told the congressional joint economic committee.

 Structural productivity continues to grow at a firm pace, and rebuilding activity following the hurricanes should boost real GDP growth for a while, he said. More uncertainty, however, surrounds the outlook for inflation.

 The 79-year-old Fed chief, who steps down at the end of January, also warned the United States must take steps to boost its supplies of natural gas, though he said they seemed adequate for the moment.

 However, a colder-than-average winter would stress this market, and prices will likely remain vulnerable to spikes until the spring, he said. In response to questions, he warned US consumers might be quite surprised by the heating bills they receive this winter.

 Greenspan made no specific reference to monetary policy but his caution about inflation prospects left no doubt that Fed policy-makers are set on a course of rising rates to keep prices from escalating.

 The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee boosted short-term US interest rates for a 12th straight time on Tuesday, pushing the trend-setting federal funds rate to 4 per cent, the highest in more than four years.

 Fed vice-chairman Roger Ferguson hammered home the message that the US central bank has its sights set squarely on squelching any possibility of runaway prices.

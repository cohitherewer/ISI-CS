 Mine leases to be revamped

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, May 22: The ministry of steel has embarked on a task to streamline the national policy on granting mining lease and licences. 

 It has set up an expert group under former secretary R. K. Dang to formulate guidelines for grant and approval of mining lease and licence of iron, manganese and chrome ore ? key raw materials for steel.

 The focus will be on a special provision (section 11.5) of the Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, which empowers state governments to make preferential allotment of reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining lease.

 The group will interact with key stakeholders of the industry to firm up its view.

 Apart from major steel companies, it will seek views from miners, industry bodies like the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and Ficci as well as state governments.

 This gains significance at a time when companies are scrambling for iron ore and states are jostling with each other for new investments in iron and steel. 

 Ore-rich states like Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh have framed policies whereby mining leases will be granted to only those who put up plants there. These policies find no resonance in the mines and mineral act. But they have led to conflict among states. 

 The Jindal groups investment in Bengal has run into rough weather with Jharkhand playing hardball over granting mining lease.

 The Jindals have now worked out a compromise formula to split the project between the two states. But it is yet to find favour with Jharkhand.

 The matter has been complicated by the entry of foreign players. In the last 10 years, domestic companies have spent Rs 30,000 crore but none, except Jindal Vijayanagar Steel Ltd (JVSL), got a mining lease. JVSL meets 30 per cent of its need from captive mines.

 In contrast, Korean steel maker Posco is being offered 600 million tonnes in Orissa for its mega project. 

 However, industry sources said states have distributed mining leases to many small players with no captive use.

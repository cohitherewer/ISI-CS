 Export woes spill over for tea growers

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Oct. 16: The cup of sorrow for tea companies is brimming over. Exports of the commodity have dwindled by 18.3 million kg to 103.5 million kg in the first eight months of this year from 121.8 million kg in the corresponding period of last year.

 The decline has been pronounced in shipments to CIS countries, the Netherlands, Germany, Poland, UAE, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Kenya and Japan.

 However, the only silver lining has been the fact that countries like Pakistan and Iraq have stepped up their purchases. Exports to Iraq have increased to 13.94 million kg this year against 4.74 million kg in the previous year.

 Shipments to Pakistan have also shown an improvement, although to a lesser degree. Sales to the neighbouring country went up to 3.43 million kg from 1.76 million kg last year. Pakistan consumes nearly 140 million kg tea, the bulk of it imported from Kenya. 

 The price realisation for Indian tea in Pakistan has also surged, a senior tea industry official said. While Indian tea fetched an average price of Rs 39.20 per kg last year, the figure has gone up to Rs 47.03 this year.

 The industry concedes that even after repeated efforts to regain the CIS market, Indian tea has not been able to make deep inroads. In the January-May period, exports to CIS countries was 15.77 million kg compared with 20.70 million kg in the previous year.

 The industry attributes the fall to oversupply of tea in the world market. All the major tea producers ? India, Kenya, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka ? have witnessed a jump in production.

 Figures show that in the first eight months of this year, Indian tea production increased 39.9 million kg to 533 million kg (493.1 million kg). At the same time, the world output has swelled 51.1 million kg to 1130.3 million kg against 1079.2 million kg in the previous year.

 Even though the Indian tea industry blames oversupply for lower exports, figures show that other tea-producing countries (except Sri Lanka) have been able to export more. Chinese exports have increased to 92.7 million kg in the period between January and April from 85.2 million kg in the previous year. 

 Similarly, Kenyan shipments have increased to 207.3 million kg in the January?July period from 192.3 million kg. Sri Lankan exports are, however, down to 134.7 million kg from 141.2 million kg.

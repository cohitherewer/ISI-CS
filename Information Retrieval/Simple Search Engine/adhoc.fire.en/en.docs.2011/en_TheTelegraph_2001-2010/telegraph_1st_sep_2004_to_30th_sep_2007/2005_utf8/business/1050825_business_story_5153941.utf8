 Tata Steel second plant in Jharkhand

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 24: The decks have been cleared for setting up one of the largest steel plants in the country in Jharkhand, chief minister Arjun Munda said today. 

 Briefing the media after arriving from Ranchi, Munda said a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between the state government and Tata Steel would be signed in the first week of September for the plant, which would produce 10 million tonnes of steel annually at an estimated investment of Rs 35,000 crore.

 This is yet another milestone in the relationship between Jharkhand and Tata Steel. The state will benefit tremendously once the plant is set up, Munda said at a news conference at Hotel Ashok, where he was accompanied by the companys managing director, B. Muthuraman. The government will give all assistance to realise the project, he added. 

 The announcement comes days after the government signed an agreement with the company on the lease renewal for Jamshedpur. 

 Though talks to set up the steel plant were on for quite some time, the green signal was given only yesterday at a board meeting of Tata Steel. 

 Muthuraman said the scheme would be realised in two phases. In the first phase, a capacity of five million tonnes will be set up within four years. The next phase will be completed in the next four years, he said. 

 Muthuraman said around 20,000 people would stand to gain employment, both direct and indirect from the project. 

 Indirect jobs will be generated by ancillary units that will emerge, Muthuraman said as he sought to dispel the notion that the company does not prefer to invest in backward areas and villages.

 The site would be decided in a few weeks, he added.

 The news about the venture comes as a shot in the arm for the beleaguered chief minister, who has been faced with dissidence from independent MLAs demanding a coordination committee and a common minimum programme. A meeting is likely tomorrow with BJP president L.K. Advani.

 The first steel plant in the country came up in Jharkhand about a century ago, which was also established by the Tatas. Muthuraman took pride in asserting that this was the only steel plant in the country that was devoid of labour unrest.

 He attributed this to the philosophy followed by the group. We believe in developing the skills of our employers and taking care of them. The same would be done in the new unit. The day is not far when Jharkhand would produce a hundred million tonnes, Muthuraman said.

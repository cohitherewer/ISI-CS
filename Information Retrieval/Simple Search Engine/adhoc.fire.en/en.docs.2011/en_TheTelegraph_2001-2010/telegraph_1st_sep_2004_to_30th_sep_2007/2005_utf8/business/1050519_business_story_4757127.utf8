 Calcutta, May 18: United Bank of India (UBI) has set a target of Rs 50,000 crore worth of business and a net profit of Rs 500 crore in the current fiscal.

 The targeted growth in net profit is 66.66 per cent over 2004-05 (Rs 300 crore) and in total business 34.4 per cent. Last year, the bank had achieved a total business of Rs 37,200 crore.

 P. K. Gupta, the bank?s newly appointed chairman and managing director, said the bank wants to increase its loan portfolio to achieve a credit-deposit (CD) ratio of 55 per cent, which now hovers around 47 per cent.

 The bank wants to lend Rs 18,000 crore this year against Rs 11,800 crore in the previous year. UBI is also considering reviewing its existing lending schemes and coming up with new products to achieve business growth.

 A conservative lending by the bank has resulted in a higher capital adequacy ratio (CAR) at 18 per cent. Efforts are being made to bring down CAR to 12 per cent.

 The bank is also confident of wiping out accumulated losses worth Rs 284 crore by September 2005.

 The net non-performing assets (NPA) of the bank stands at Rs 277 crore and the gross idle assets at Rs 726 crore.

 Gupta, however, did not say whether the bank has shelved the plan for floating a public issue. ?Nothing has been decided yet,? he added.

 The bank plans to add one million customers in the current fiscal and take the total number to 14.7 million.

 UBI is in a strategic relationship with Western Union to provide inbound money transfer services across the country. The money transfer will be carried out through Weizmann Forex ? the primary agent of Western Union.

 In the first phase, the service will be available to 96 branches across the country, while in the second phase, 175 more branches will offer this service. Later on, this service will be extended to all branches if good response is received.

 P. Basu, general manager (corporate business group), said the tie-up would put an end to the remittance problem of various currencies.

 Gupta added that the tie-up would help the bank enhance the non-interest income and deposit base as well.

 Chetan Mehera, managing director of Weizmann Forex, said a single transaction should not be more than $2,500 and there will not be more than 12 transactions a year.

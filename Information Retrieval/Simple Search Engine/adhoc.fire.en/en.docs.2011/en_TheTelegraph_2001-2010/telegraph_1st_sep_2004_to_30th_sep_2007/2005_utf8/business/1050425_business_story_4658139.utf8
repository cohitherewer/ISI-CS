 National Thermal Corp, TCS in sensex

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, April 24: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) will replace Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL) and Zee Telefilms in the sensex, BSE said in a release here today.

 The change will be effective from June 6, 2005. The decision to reshuffle the country?s most widely watched market barometer was taken at a meeting of the BSE?s index committee on April 23, the exchange said in its release.

 Meanwhile, the controversy over when Anil Ambani?s resignation as vice-chairman of IPCL was accepted deepened when a senior BSE official said he was not satisfied with the firm?s April 23 notice. He asserted that the matter would be pursued ?appropriately?.

 ?On the face of it, there appears to be a dichotomy in what was conveyed on January 20 and the communication of April 23,? the official said. 

 IPCL told the BSE on January 20 that its board had considered Anil?s resignation that day, but requested him to reconsider it. 

 On Saturday, the company finally informed the bourses that it had accepted Anil?s resignation. 

 IPCL, the Vadodhra-based petro-chemicals company, is headed by Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani. IPCL informed the BSE on Saturday that Anils resignation had been considered on January 20 and that ?he ceases to be on the board of the company?. IPCL sent this communication by way of clarification for its earlier letter dated January 20. In that letter, IPCL had said Anils resignation was considered by the board that day and it had asked him to reconsider it. 

 There was no further communication on this subject till Friday this week. IPCLs statement on Friday that the board had again noted his resignation at the March 30 board meeting means the issue was not dealt with till the end of March.

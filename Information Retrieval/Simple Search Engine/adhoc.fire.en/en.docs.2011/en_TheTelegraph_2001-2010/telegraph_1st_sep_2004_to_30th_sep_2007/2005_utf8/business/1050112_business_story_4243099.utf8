 Mumbai, Jan. 11: Infosys Technologies will flash its third-quarter scorecard on Wednesday amid forecasts that are putting the firm?s net profit at around Rs 471-480 crore.

 The numbers come at a time when bourses have been lurching from one losing session to another since the new-year flourish. It also follows a tepid set of numbers dished out today by MphasiS, whose bottomline blues have made the operators fear similar letdowns.

 Despite the fright, analysts are not too worried. They expect Infosys to roll ahead on its trail-blazing path, posting numbers that are better than its own prognosis.

 If the Bangalore infotech bellwether does tot up a tally of around Rs 480 crore, it would mean a 5 per cent sequential rise; revenues are seen in the region of Rs 1,890 crore. 

 Observers? eyes are peeled not only on the bottomline. Their gaze will also turn to other critical factors, such as the recent appreciation of the rupee against the dollar, besides the all-important earnings guidance.

 There is near unanimity among analysts that the rupee?s 6 per cent rise against the greenback is a concern for infotech firms, whose profit margins could be squeezed.

 ?The recent appreciation in the value of the rupee would certainly make an impact on Infosys? numbers. That is why it is generally expected that the sequential growth in its bottomline will be muted compared with the expansion in topline,? an analyst with a brokerage said.

 Dhiraj Sachdev, portfolio manager at ASK Raymond James, said Infosys and other large infotech firms are in a better position now in terms of their scale and service to win new customers. ?At this stage of their growth, they are also poised to benefit from the offshoring trend.?

 He expects Infosys to beat its own forecast, with strong volumes and the offshoring boom being driving forces. Margins are likely to be maintained at last quarter?s levels.

 While declaring its second-quarter results, the company forecast income for the October-December period at Rs 1,869 crore and Rs 1,882 crore, besides an earnings per share of Rs 17.10. Net profit for the third-quarter of the previous financial year was Rs 328.14 crore.

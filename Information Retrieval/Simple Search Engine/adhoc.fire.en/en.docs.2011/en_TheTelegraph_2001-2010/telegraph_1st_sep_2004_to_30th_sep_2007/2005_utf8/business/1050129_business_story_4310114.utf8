 Mumbai, Jan. 28: Grasim Industries Ltd has posted a 33 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 217 crore in the quarter ended December 31 compared with Rs 163.7 crore in the corresponding period last year, beating street expectations.

 The net turnover of the diversified major rose 17 per cent to Rs 1560 crore against Rs 1332 crore in the same period last fiscal. All the major businesses of the flagship company of the AV Birla group recorded growth in production, sales volume and realisations.

 The net realisations from all its divisions rose, even as there was a drop in the sales volume of viscose staple fibre (VSF) and caustic soda. While realisations from VSF rose 15 per cent, it was 7 per cent for cement, 14 per cent for white cement, 48 per cent for sponge iron and 18 per cent for chemical products.

 Cement production at 3.11 million tonnes and sales volumes at 3.19 million tonnes were higher by 7 per cent and 8 per cent respectively. Realisations were higher at Rs 1775 per tonne. Grasim said the increase in realisation was offset by a sharp rise in key input costs.

 Grasim has planned a capital expenditure of Rs 690 crore in this fiscal and the next. A part of the amount will be spent on setting up a captive thermal power plant at Vikram Cement, Jawad, and an additional turbine at Rajashree Cement, Mankhed. It will also be used for ongoing modernisation and capacity expansion through de-bottlenecking. 

 The company will also set up a 1-million-tonne grinding unit at Dadri.

 In VSF, though capacity utilisation was more than 100 per cent, sales volumes were impacted because of increased availability of cotton during the period. Grasim said operating margins improved despite a sharp increase in prices of key inputs that included pulp, caustic soda and sulphur.

 However, in the chemical business, both production and sales volumes were lower by 5 per cent and 3 per cent respectively. 

 This will, however, offset by improved realisations of 18 per cent over the corresponding quarter.

 The sponge iron segment saw an upturn in demand during the quarter combined with a sharp rise in scrap prices that enabled better realisation.

 During the nine-month period, net profit of the company rose 32 per cent at Rs 656 crore, while net turnover was up 25 per cent at Rs 3680.1 crore.

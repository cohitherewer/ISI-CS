 Daimler plans to launch bank in US

 Berlin, Nov. 16 (Reuters): DaimlerChrysler intends to launch its own bank in the United States as a way to reduce borrowing costs, the head of the German-American carmakers financial services division said.

 We hope to get approval in the first quarter of 2006, Juergen Walker told reporters in Berlin on Tuesday.

 The bank could operate across the US by gaining a license in the state of Utah as long as it is organisationally separate from the groups car business, Walker explained.

 The finance arm at worlds fifth-biggest carmaker could use such an arrangement to get better borrowing terms than the overall group can arrange, he said.

 DaimlerChrysler is rated BBB by Standard amp; Poors, A3 by Moodys and BBB+ by Fitch, which is higher than US rivals General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co, whose debt ratings have fallen below investment grade.

 DaimlerChrysler already operates a bank in Germany and recently won approval to offer financial services such as leasing and car loans in China. US operations make up around 70 per cent of the financial services divisions business volume. The division boosted nine-month operating profit 1 per cent to 1.12 billion euros. 

 We expect to have good results for the full year as well, Walker said, but he would not specify whether they would be above the 1.25-billion euro operating profit it made in 2004.

 Walker said his division would continue to focus on core businesses such as leasing, finance for private customers, insurance and fleet management. It remained committed to its 45 per cent stake in Toll Collect, which operates Germanys truck toll system.

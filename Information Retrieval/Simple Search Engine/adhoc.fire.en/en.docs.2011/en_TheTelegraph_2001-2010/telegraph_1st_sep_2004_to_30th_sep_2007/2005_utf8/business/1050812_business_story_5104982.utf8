 Calcutta, Aug. 11: The phaseout of the Qualis by Toyota has proved to be a boon for Tata Motors.

 The Tata firm has recorded an incremental growth of 5 per cent after Toyota decided to withdraw the model in December 2004 and introduced Innova.

 ?There is a vacuum in the market and we have gained as a result of that,? head-marketing utility vehicles R.J. Chinoy said.

 Toyota used to sell 3500 units of Qualis per month.

 Tata Motors has brands like Sumo, Spacio and Safari in the utility vehicle segment. Some of them are priced similarly as the Qualis.

 The Sumo, with a sale of about 35,000 units a month, is likely to be the biggest beneficiary of the space created by Qualis. Chinoy was in the city to launch new variants within the Safari range. The utility vehicles market grew 20.46 per cent in 2004-05, while the company?s sales grew 7.53 per cent.

 In the first four months of this year, passenger car sales growth was restricted by the introduction of the value-added tax, the Bharat-III norms and the Mumbai floods.

 Chinoy expected the sales to stage a turnaround in August.

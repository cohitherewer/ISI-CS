14/2, Burdwan Road

 If the Hafeez Contractor elevation has wowed you as you drove through the ornate wrought-iron entrance and stepped into the elegant double-height lobby on the ground floor, profusely clad in Italian marble, the inside of this nine-floor apartment won?t disappoint you either.

 The four bedrooms are all fitted with wall-to-wall wardrobes and cabinets, with textured finish on one side. As you enter the balcony attached to the master bedroom, a huge landscaped garden with interesting paving patterns and a swimming pool heave into view.

 The capacious living-dining hall, with split air-conditioning, has an ample wooden chest with spacious drawers, plush, leather-upholstered sofas and a slick glass-top dining unit seating eight. A sliding-door attendant room and a puja room complement the unit.

 The roomy kitchen is fitted with glass-fronted storage cupboards and wooden cabinets. The baths are clad in floor-to-ceiling ceramic tiles and fitted with premium sanitaryware. 

 Modern stone and designed plastering form the fa?ade on which Sanon Sen amp; Associates have collaborated with Contractor.

 Each flat inside the complex is south open at some point.

 STATUS: Ready

 PRICE: Rs 96 lakh (approx.)

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Ramachandran: New plans

 Mumbai, March 29: Philips India today announced the launch of a brand campaign, Sense and Simplicity, in a bid to project itself as a more focussed enterprise providing simple technological solutions.

 The company will spend close to euro 2.5 million for the brand campaign in India, which will start in April and continue for two months. The campaign will focus on affluent decision-makers in the age group of 25 to 55.

 The exercise is in line with the strategy of Netherlands-based Royal Philips Electronics, owners of Philips India, to go in for an image makeover. 

 The parent company is spending nearly euro 80 million in 11 key markets, including India, to bring its message to customers.

 According to Philips, the campaign is aimed at giving customers a distinct image of a sharper and more focussed company. 

 It marks an important step in Philips? ongoing transformation as a market driven company. 

 Addressing newspersons here today, Philips India chief executive and managing director K. Ramachandran said the campaign comes after the company reported its highest business activity last year. ?We are growing our market position and the transition towards being a market driven company is at full swing.?

 The campaign will concentrate on the company?s lines of business ? healthcare, lifestyle and technology. 

 ?The campaign will focus firmly on a core target group comprising 20 per cent of the people who do 80 per cent of the buying and who share a dislike for the unnecessary hassles often created by technology,? he added.

 Bengal turns blind eye to woes of small steel units

 Bhattacharjee: Big plans

 Calcutta, March 27: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is using its influence to tie up iron ore for the Jindals? steel project, but is unaware that smaller companies are moving out of the state for want of the raw material.

 Industry sources said smaller units lack enough political clout to draw the government?s attention to this fact.

 ?The state is yet to wake up to this reality. It must act before it is too late,? sources added.

 Jharkhand, Orissa and Chhattisgarh, with rich iron ore and coal deposits, have become preferred destinations for steel-making units.

 The state witnessed a tremendous surge in investment in the last 10 years in different areas of iron and steel. However, many of these units, located in Burdwan and Bankura districts, are now venturing out of Bengal to seek captive mines.

 For instance, the Calcutta-based Electrosteel Castings Ltd (ECL) has chalked out an ambitious plan to foray into steel making while expanding the present product line with an estimated investment of Rs 1,000 crore.

 However, the company is primarily looking at sites outside Bengal to set up its units or increase capacity because of want of crucial raw materials like iron ore and coal. ECL may set up a unit in Jharkhand as it is eyeing long-term mining leases in that state.

 While the Bengal government is busy scouting for raw materials like iron ore for the Jindal group, which promised an integrated plant in the state, local units rued the fact that their plight was not heard. ?While the government is negotiating iron ore for the Jindal plant, it should also secure the same for smaller units,? sources said.

 Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand are insisting that companies setting up plants in their states would be given the mining rights.

 Even as states cannot make any discrimination on the basis of whether raw materials are being used within the state, such has become the norm now to attract investment or stop flight of capital.

 In today?s world, guaranteed supplies of iron ore and coal have become the paramount criteria for finalising a steel plant of any significant capacity.

 Iron ore prices will go up by 71 per cent world-wide, while coking coal prices will rise by 119 per cent next financial year.

 Against this backdrop of stiff prices, captive mines are the best bet for survival. Not surprisingly, international steel majors like Posco are looking at Orissa for setting up units.

 The Jindal group said it would invest Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 crore in Bengal to build a stainless steel plant with an annual capacity of 5 million tonnes. However, they made it clear that the proposed project would come up only if the state government could guarantee the supply of iron ore from either Orissa or Jharkhand.

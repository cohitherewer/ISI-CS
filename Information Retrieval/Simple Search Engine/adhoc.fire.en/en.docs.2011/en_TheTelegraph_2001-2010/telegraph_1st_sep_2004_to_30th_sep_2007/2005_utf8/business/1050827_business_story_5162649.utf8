 Eveready clears $40-m GDR issue

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 26: The board of Eveready Industries India Limited, the flagship company of the BM Khaitan group, today approved a GDR issue of up to $40 million (Rs 180 crore) and a preferential issue of Rs 64.12 crore to promoters.

 The GDR listing will take place in November on the Luxembourg exchange.

 The board has cleared the proposal to issue 67.50 lakh convertible warrants to several parties belonging to the promoter group, including some of the directors of the company and relatives, friends and associates. Each warrant will be priced at Rs 95 for a share of Rs 5 each.

 The proposed allotees have agreed to subscribe to the warrants at the above price and will exercise their option to convert the warrant into equity shares only after the dilution of their holdings.

 The allottees will not seek conversion of warrants into shares in excess of 5 per cent of the total issued equity capital in a financial year. The total holding of the promoter group, including the proposed allottees, will be maintained below 55 per cent at all time unless they choose to make an open offer.

 The equity shares allotted by conversion of warrants shall be subject to a lock-in period of one year from the date of allotment. 

 The boards decision will be ratified at an extra-ordinary general meeting to be held on September 20.

 The company has also allowed the managing director to negotiate the sale of nearly 2.2 lakh square feet of space at the companys proposed IT Park at Chennai. We expect to garner Rs 70 crore from the sale of the proposed area, said Deepak Khaitan, executive vice-chairman and managing director of Eveready Industries.

 Eveready is setting up a state-of-the-art technology park in Chennai in collaboration with Khivraj Tech Park and the first phase of the park will be ready by March 2006.

 The company intends to reduce debt and fund its capacity expansion programme from the fresh resources that would be mopped up.

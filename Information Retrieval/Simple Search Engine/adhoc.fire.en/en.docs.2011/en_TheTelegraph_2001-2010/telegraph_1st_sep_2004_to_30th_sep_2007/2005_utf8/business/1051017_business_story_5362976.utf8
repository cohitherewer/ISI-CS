 Low-cost PCs? Check fine print

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 16: The prices of personal computers are moving south but only in a virtual world. 

 HCL has recently launched a home PC with Linux open source software for Rs 9,990. But read the fine print and the actual price of the PC goes up to Rs 11,240. The additional Rs 1,250 is for handling, freight, forwarding insurance and installation charges. The value added tax and other local levies and octroi add up to another Rs 1000. The PC comes with Linux based operating system. But if you are a fan of Bill Gates Windows, then be prepared to shell out another Rs 1,250 for the Windows Xp bi-lingual starter edition ? unless you are comfortable with and brave enough to use pirated software. 

 The PC from HCL is likely to be available only in the first quarter of 2006-07.

 In the last few months this is the second sub-Rs 10,000 PC from HCL but the cost for the consumer is between Rs 11,000 and Rs 12,500. HCL has a tie-up with both Intel and AMD the two leading manufacturers of microprocessors.

 Ajay Chowdhry, chairman and chief executive officer of HCL Infosystems Ltd, said, There is no problem in selling AMD and Intel based PCs since ultimately the consumer will decide about the choice and that will determine the trend.

 Earlier launching the low-cost PC, Union communications and information technology minster Dayanidhi Maran urged AMD to set up a manufacturing unit in India and Microsoft to bring down the cost of its starter edition from Rs 1250 to Rs 750.

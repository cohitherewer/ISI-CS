 Tata Tele gets show-cause call

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 In a pensive mood 

 New Delhi, July 18: The department of telecommunications (DoT) has issued a show-cause notice to Tata Teleservices Ltd asking it to explain as to why a penalty of Rs 50 crore should not be imposed for violating the Internet service provider licence (ISP) under which it was offering push-to-talk services.

 However, a Tata Tele spokesperson claimed that the company has not received any notice. We have not received any notice till date. Hence, we cannot comment on it. 

 The DoT show-cause comes after the company has replied to an earlier notice sent in June.

 According to the DoT, Tata Teleservices has violated the ISP licence conditions while offering push-to-talk (PTT) services. PTT is a method of conversing on half-duplex communication lines. It includes a two-way radio ? pushing a button to send, allowing voice communication to be transmitted, and releasing to allow voice communication to be received. 

 Tata Teleservices have been issued a number of notices ever since the company launched the PTT service in October, as the DoT had raised the issue of numbering plan and payment of interconnection charges involved in the service.

 DoT is understood to have said the frequency used by the Tatas ISP licence was originally allotted to the company for unified access service and this led to the violation of the licence terms and conditions.

 The DoT had alleged that it was a deliberate attempt to misguide security agencies. 

 Although Tatas have stopped offering PTT services, the government has sought explanation for violation of licence conditions. Particularly their compliance to interconnect user charges, which includes payment of levies like access deficit charge (ADC) for STD calls. 

 In April, the company had paid Rs 3.86 lakh as ADC for eight circles where PTT was offered. But the money was returned by the DoT, asking the company to give a break up of the ADC for each circle. 

 Tata Teleservices had earlier defended the service saying they were offering it under the ISP licence.

 BPCL plans stake sale in Bina refinery

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 On the move

 Mumbai, Sept. 24: Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd is planning to sell 22 per cent equity of its Bina refinery project to upstream oil producers, financial institutions or private equity investors. The company has also revised the investment estimate of the project to Rs 9,100 crore from Rs 7,500 crore earlier.

 After the companys annual general meeting on Friday, BPCLs chairman and managing director, Ashok Sinha, told newspersons that the 6 million-tonne refinery was expected to go on stream by December 2009. The corporation will invest Rs 1,800 crore and hold 50 per cent stake in the venture while Oman Oil will have close to 3 per cent share in it, he said.

 The project, to be implemented through a joint venture company, Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd, has been held up for a long time due to delays in obtaining environmental clearances, which were obtained last year. 

 BPCL now plans to approach banks and financial institutions for financial closure of the project, which has been designed by Engineers India Ltd. After receiving commitments with regard to capital, the corporation would take a final investment decision, Sinha said.

 The corporation is contemplating to mobilise Rs 1,000 crore (equivalent to 25 per cent equity) through an initial public offering (IPO) and sell the balance 22 per cent to upstream companies, financial institutions or private equity investors. 

 In order to obtain extra mileage from the project, BPCL may also lend the infrastructure to a third party player who might set up a petrochemical plant in the refinery site.

 Sinha told the shareholders that the discussions with Madhya Pradesh government for tax concessions for the project was fruitful and the company has been allowed to defer the payment of local sales tax to the extent of Rs 250 crore per annum. The project has also been granted the payment waiver for central sales tax for a period of 15 years.

 Responding to a query on under-recoveries, Sinha said that it was expected to be in the region of Rs 4,000 crore for the current fiscal. However, a large part of it would be recovered from the oil bonds and other companies sharing the burden. 

 But a marginal deficit will still remain, which the corporation expects to make good during the course of this year.

 BPCL is also looking at growing its gas distribution business where the investments involved are not huge.

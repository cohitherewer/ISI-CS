 Mumbai, March 3: Hero Honda Motors, the country?s biggest motorcycle maker, is planning to launch a scooter model. 

 ?We will launch a scooter by March 2006,? said Atul Sobti, executive director-business operations. He declined to give further details.

 The decline in the domestic scooter market has been arrested and it is currently witnessing a resurgence.

 Chairman Brijmohan Lall Munjal and his son and managing director Pawan Munjal with senior representatives from Honda Motors were here today to launch Super Splendor, a four-stroke 125cc bike. With this launch, Hero Honda is planning to take on rivals like Bajaj Auto who have a considerable ground in the 125cc segment.

 Hero Honda, in which the Munjal family and Japan?s Honda Motor Co hold a 26 per cent stake each, said the Super Splendor uses a more fuel-efficient and robust engine. It is priced at Rs 42,231, ex-showroom. The engine, dubbed Quantum Core 1, is developed by Honda solely for its Indian partner. It offers 5 km more mileage than the 100cc Splendor and greater power.

 ?We are sure this breakthrough in engine technology will reinforce the commitment and support from our joint venture partner ? Honda Motors,? Brijmohan Lall said.

 After straddling the motorcycle industry for a decade now, Hero Honda?s plans to launch a scooter in 2005-06 excited dealers as it allows them to cater to a wider customer base. 

 It is interesting to note that Honda Motor amp; Scooter India Pvt Ltd, the wholly owned Honda subsidiary that makes the Activa, is heavily exposed to the scooter segment. The Honda subsidiary had recently introduced the Unicorn, a 150-cc motorbike, which is officially touted to compete with the Bajaj Pulsar.

 The senior Munjal brushed away concerns of conflict of interest saying, ?The two companies will stay independent. But we will sit together and decide which company should do what?.

 Brijmohan Lall also brushed away concerns of the smaller segment, especially the Tatas? ?people?s car making a dent in the world?s largest two-wheeler market?. 

 ?A two-wheeler customer has three main concerns. The maintenance cost should not be more than Rs 200-300 per month, fuel efficiency and easy parking of the vehicle. ?Which car in the world can give that?? the chairman asked.

 With the Super Splendor launch, Hero Honda is nearly on par with the 125cc Discover of Bajaj Auto Ltd, the number 2 motorcycle maker, and TVS Victor from TVS Motor Co, the third-biggest producer.

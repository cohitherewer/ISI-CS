 Fresh equity for Centurion

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 10: Centurion Bank will raise fresh equity of up to Rs 600 crore and is looking at a public issue or private placement or an international offer as options.

 Managing director Shailendra Bhandari said the plan is merely an enabling resolution that must be cleared by shareholders. ?The proposal to raise Rs 600 crore is an enabling one. We require only half of it now,? he added.

 Money needs to be raised to support the strong growth in loan disbursals expected over the next few quarters. At least, Rs 300 crore will meet short-term needs. 

 ?The proposed equity issue in the next few months will provide the support and impetus required for strong organic growth over the ensuing quarters. We are confident of accelerating our profitability,? he added.

 Explaining why fresh funds are needed, Bhandari said the 50 per cent year-on-year surge in retail credit has made it necessary for Centurion to spread its presence. On the cards are 14 new branches, expected by March, and a slew of new financial products.

 The bank?s letter to exchanges said its directors approved a proposal at their meeting today to raise additional equity of an amount ?not exceeding Rs 600 crore in one or more tranches?. This would be done either through a domestic public issue or by way of private placement of shares or in the form of an international offering through ADRs, GDRs or foreign bonds.

Profit run

 Centurion Bank has reported a third-quarter net profit of Rs 7.10 crore compared with a loss of Rs 6.54 crore same time last year. Net interest income grew 34 per cent to Rs 45.84 crore. 

 Non-performing assets (NPAs) slid to 3.36 per cent of all loans from 6.47 per cent. Retail assets were at Rs 1,876 crore, up from Rs 1,220 crore. The difference between rates paid and charged was 4.76 per cent, up from 4.26 per cent.

 ?The bank continues to deliver quarter-on-quarter growth in profits and has consolidated its position in the retail market,? Bhandari said. Chairman Rana Talwar said the results reflect the success of the strategy adopted by the new management. 

 ?The improvements in net interest income, net spread, net NPAs and net profit are the outcome of the recapitalisation and the focus on the retail segment,? he added. 

 Even in the nine months to December, the bank turned in a net profit of Rs 15.51 crore against a loss of Rs 7.42 crore.

 Institutions lap up ICICI Bank flotation

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 6: ICICI Banks domestic public offering is a hit with qualified institutional buyers, while the response from retail investors has been lukewarm. The issue, which closed today, was subscribed 7.1 times. 

 The banks American depository shares (ADS) issue of $500 million was subscribed by more than 12 times. The overseas flotation closes tomorrow.

 ICICI Bank is offering a part of the ADS issue to investors from Japan through a public offering without listing (POWL) component. Sources added that Japanese retail investors have put $3 billion into the issue. 

 It is expected that as the offer closes, the ADS issue may be subscribed by more than 20 times, they added.

 The domestic issue saw a tepid response from retail investors. The bank had even allowed retail investors to get shares at a discount of 5 per cent on the issue price. 

 Retail subscription was only 70 per cent of the total number of shares meant for this category. However, sources said this figure did not mean that retail investors have shunned the issue. The response from the retail end is good when we consider the fact that ICICI Bank shares are already listed on the bourses, they added.

 However, interest from the institutions brought some cheer. Sources said these investors had filed bids worth Rs 33,600 crore compared with the offer size of Rs 2,400 crore. This translated into an oversubscription of more than 14 times.

 Nippon tech for Tata Steel

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Aug. 29: Tata Steel today signed a memorandum of understanding with Nippon Steel Corporation (NSC) under which the Japanese steelmaker will provide technical assistance to the Tata flagship for its proposed steel plant near Kalinganagar in Jajpur district of Orissa. 

 The steel plant will be set up with an initial capacity of 6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa). 

 According to the agreement, Nippon Steel will assist Tata Steel in selecting the most appropriate facility planning and layout for the proposed steel plant. 

 The MoU was signed by Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman and Nippon Steel managing director H. Shima on behalf of their companies in the presence of the state steel and mines secretary Bhaskar Chatterjee. 

 Signing the agreement, Muthuraman said his company chose to partner with Nippon Steel in this area as it is the best steel technology company in the world. 

 Speaking on the occasion, Shima said, The company is happy to collaborate with Tata Steel because it is the topmost steel technology company in India. It also has rich experience in steel making since the turn of the century.

 In November last year, the Tatas had signed an MoU with the state government for setting up a 6 mtpa integrated steel plant at Duburi in coastal Jajpur district at a cost of Rs 15,400 crore. 

 Tata Steel already has an alliance with Nippon Steel for the cold rolling mill at its Jamshedpur steel works. 

 Recently, it has signed another agreement with the Japanese company for increasing its hot-rolling and cold-rolling capacities at the Jamshedpur plant by 1 mtpa and 2.4 mtpa, respectively.

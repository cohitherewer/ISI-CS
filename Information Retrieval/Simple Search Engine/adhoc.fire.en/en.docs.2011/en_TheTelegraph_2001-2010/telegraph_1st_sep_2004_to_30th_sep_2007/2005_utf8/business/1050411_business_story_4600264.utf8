 Trent slips into new growth garb

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 10: Trent has chalked out plans to consolidate its position in the existing markets and break into new ones.

 The Rs 182-crore company from the Tata stable retails apparel and lifestyle products through its Westside outlets. It also reaches out to the mass market via Star India Bazaar. 

 The company has drawn up plans to set up 17 stores over the next three years. In addition, an upgrade of its existing stores is on the anvil. According to the company, providing a new look and enhanced shopping experience would lead to greater customer interest. Expansion of some of the stores is also expected to increase the range of offerings.

 In the offer letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for a rights issue, Trent said the capital expenditure of setting up stores and upgrading existing ones is expected to be over Rs 81 crore. 

 The project cost is estimated at Rs 124 crore. Close to Rs 118.05 crore will come from the rights issue; the rest of the money will be found in internal accruals.

 Trent plans to issue over 13.11 lakh partly convertible debentures of Rs 900 each with detachable warrants on rights basis in the ratio of one debenture with one detachable warrant for every 10 shares held by its shareholders.

 The company has expanded its Westside stores in major cities and smaller towns, and is now present in 10 cities. 

 Last year, it sharpened its focus on the food and grocery business by setting up its first hypermarket store under the brand name of Star India Bazaar in Ahmedabad.

 While Star India Bazaar offers private labels at lower prices, Trent has drawn up a strategy to extend the private label programme to other categories apart from food, non-food (cleaning aids), consumer durables, apparel, luggage and house wares.

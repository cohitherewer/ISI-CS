 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: The government has initiated a move to make politicians and trade union leaders eligible for posts of non-official independent directors on boards of public sector companies. At present, only eminent professionals and technocrats are eligible for these posts.

 We have written to the Prime Minister suggesting changes in norms for appointment of independent directors to include eminent persons from other walks of life besides professionals and technocrats, Santosh Mohan Dev, minister for heavy industries and public enterprises, said today.

 The petroleum ministry has already forwarded a list of Congressmen to the department of public enterprises to be considered for the post of non-official directors on the boards of the ONGC, Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum, BPCL and Gail.

 Congressmen figuring on the list include former Assam minister Devanand Konwar, Wasim Ahmed, Manish Tiwari, Shaktisinh Gohil and Alka Lamba. The list also includes the names of some ex-MPs, ex-MLAs and office-bearers of the party.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said there was no move to change the non-official directors of any public sector oil company before their terms expired. Aiyar said all the non-official directors appointed by the NDA government can complete their terms and there was no move to pack the boards with Congressmen or those affiliated to the Congress.

 New Delhi, Feb. 24: Toyota Motor ? the world?s third largest carmaker ? has swung the wheel and driven aggressively into the fiercely competitive mid-size market with the Innova, which is attractively priced at Rs 6.82 lakh for the no-frills petrol variant.

 The Innova ? which is replacing the ageing Qualis ? is a vehicle that blends the features of a sedan with those of a multi-utility vehicle.

 Living up to its name, it is a first of its kind ? a car with three rows of seats, with a back row that can fold back along the sides like a Ute.

 The Japanese carmaker, which launched the Innova simultaneously in five cities, said it expected to sell 45,000 units of the car in India during 2005, and another 60,000 units next year. 

 Toyota Kirloskar Motor ? the Indian arm of the Japanese carmaker ? said it planned to sell 4,500 units in the first month itself.

 The vehicle will be available in diesel and petrol variants. The carmaker has versions for a range of price points: the petrol version will be sold between Rs 6.82 lakh and Rs 9.43 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) and the diesel variants at Rs 7.42 lakh and Rs 10.03 lakh.

 There will be five different variants of the Innova in the 2- litre petrol and the 2.5 litre diesel variants and in seven colours. 

 Meanwhile, the company is rolling back production of the Qualis ? the multi utility vehicle (MUV) with which it launched operations in the country.

 Innova is being described as creating a new category that combines the best of an MUV and a sedan. 

 Toyota Motor president Fujio Cho said, ?Innova not only fulfills the needs of the MUV, but also strongly appeals to the passenger car customers.? 

 Innova is the first generation vehicle on the IMV (Innovative International Multipurpose Vehicle) platform. The company officials said the IMV project is a strategy to make automobiles that can satisfy needs of the customers all over the world.

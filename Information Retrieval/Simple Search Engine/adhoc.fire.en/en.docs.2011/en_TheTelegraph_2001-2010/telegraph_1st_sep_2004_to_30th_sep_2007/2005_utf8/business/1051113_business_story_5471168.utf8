 Calcutta, Nov. 12: Tata Consultancy Services has chosen to grow by acquisition.

 ?We plan to grow by acquisitions for which special purpose vehicles (SPV) will be created. The absorption of personnel in the acquired companies will also add to our manpower strengths,? TCS chief executive S. Ramadorai said. 

 However, Ramadorai did not divulge any near-term acquisition plan, but said the company was eyeing verticals like telecom, healthcare, insurance, energy, utilities and government. He added that the company would soon announce products and solutions for telecom companies. ?We will build solutions and products through collaboration among multiple centres,? he said.

 The infotech company from the Tata stable recently acquired Comicrom, a Chilean firm in the banking and pensions BPO business. The buyout was aimed at enhancing the company?s strategy to tap segment specific BPO opportunities and offer next generation, platform-led BPO services.

 Last month, TCS acquired Sydney-based Financial Network Services (FNS), a core banking solutions vendor, and set up a subsidiary in the UK. While the Australian firm is expected to help the company address global retail and corporate banking customers, its UK arm provides business process services for life and pension sectors.

 TCS is planning to tap the Latin American market and has already put in place a five-year action plan. 

 The company has plans to set up a development centre in Brazil, also catering to Portugal. Its Uruguay centre is already taking care of Spain and Mexico markets.

 At present, banking and financial services contribute 40 per cent of the company?s revenues, while telecom accounts for only 10 per cent. The retail sector contributes 5-6 per cent, manufacturing 18 per cent, life sciences and energy 8 per cent. The government sector accounts for 2 per cent.

 Elaborating on the company?s human resource plans, Ramadorai said the company would recruit 18000 personnel in the current financial year.

 About TCS?s Calcutta centre, Ajoyendra Mukherjee, vice-president and head of operations in the city, said expansion would follow business requirements. 

 ?Our headcount stands at just over 4500. We will have 5500 employees in our centre here by the year-end,? he said.

 Allaying fears of a shortage of quality manpower, Ramadorai said the industry would not face any crisis in the next two to three years. TCS has initiated an academic interface programme to groom IT professionals. 

 ?The programme will help us ensure that a process of continuous engagement and collaboration increase the talent pool,? Ramadorai said.

 Helpline for investors in pension plan

 Swarup: Help at hand

 New Delhi, April 27: The pension regulator will set up a committee to provide financial advisory services to investors joining the proposed new pension scheme (NPS).

 ?The regulator will provide financial advisory services to investors. We will set up a committee as soon as the statutory body is in place. It will be a group of in-house people,? said D. Swarup, chairman of the interim Pension Fund Regulatory Development Authority, on the sidelines of a workshop on pensions organised by Assocham.

 In line with the insurance sector, FDI in the pension sector may be fixed at 26 per cent. ?FDI may be initially pegged at 26 per cent for pension sector as in the case of insurance sector. However, it is for government to decide and notify it,? said Swarup.

 The pension bill does not provide for the FDI cap and neither does PFRDA have the right to decide on it. The government will have to notify the FDI limit as has been done for other sectors like telecom and aviation.

 The PFRDA bill was introduced in Parliament late last month and was referred to the standing committee on finance. 

 The committee has been requested to give its recommendations quickly so that the bill could be passed in the monsoon session.

 The NPS will offer three options to investors: option A is investment in a safe debt-oriented scheme; option B will be a balanced scheme with moderate exposure in equity, and option C will be a growth scheme with high exposure in equity.

 Under the safe option, pension fund managers can invest at least 60 per cent of the contribution in low-risk government papers up to 30 per cent in bonds and 10 per cent in equity.

 Under the balanced option, the exposure in government securities will be at least 40 per cent, up to 40 per cent in bonds and up to 20 per cent in equities.

 In the high-yielding growth option, almost half of the contribution can be invested in equities, at least 25 per cent in government papers and up to 25 per cent in bonds.

 The NPS will neither promise any assured return nor a sovereign guarantee, he said adding ?we have several options even for the risk averse?.

 The safe option A will be the ?default option? for any investor who can not decide on any particular option.

 At present, the pension bill of the central and state governments accounts for nearly 1.7 per cent of the GDP, totalling a sum of Rs 52,000 crore. This amount is increasing by 25 per cent per annum, Swarup said.

 The government will give an 8 per cent fixed return on the investment made by employees joining the defined contribution pension scheme from January 1, 2004.

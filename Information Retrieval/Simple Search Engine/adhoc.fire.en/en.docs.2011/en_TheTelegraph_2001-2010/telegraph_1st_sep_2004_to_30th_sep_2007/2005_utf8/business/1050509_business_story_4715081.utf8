The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Cross-currents ripple in stock market tide

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Calcutta, May 8: Equity market thrives on investors contrary views about which stock to bet their money on. 

 Take for example, the foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and the domestic financial institutions (FIs), the two big movers of the market. For financial year 2004-05, the respective exposures of these two entities across sectors have been grossly different. 

 While the bank scrips caught the fancy of the FIIs during the period, FIs put their money in FMCG companies. As on March 31, 2005, the FIIs had their highest sectoral holding in the banking sector at 21.28 per cent, while 14.86 per cent of the investment portfolio of the FIs during the year was in the FMCG sector.

 However, the banking sector was equally important for the FIs when compared with the FMCG sector. But the fast moving consumer goods sector at 5.73 per cent ranked low on the FIIs investment preference along with the auto sector.

 Infotech was the second most preferred sector for the FIIs in which they had an exposure of 20.36 per cent. But domestic institutions went slow on the sector with an exposure of just 6.88 per cent. 

 Investment opinions were divided on the capital goods and cement sectors, too. In the capital goods sector, the domestic institutions made their fifth largest sectoral holding at 7.79 per cent, while the foreigners ranked it ninth at 3.79 per cent on their investment cart. In cement, the FIs held 5.02 per cent, while the FIIs held 2.8 per cent.

 However, oil and gas was the only major sector in which both the entities showed almost equal preference, though the foreigners maintained a higher exposure at 17.49 per cent than the domestic institutions 14.12 per cent.

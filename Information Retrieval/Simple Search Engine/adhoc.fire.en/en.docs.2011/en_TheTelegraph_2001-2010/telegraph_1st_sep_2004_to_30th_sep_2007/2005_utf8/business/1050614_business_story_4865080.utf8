 P amp;G trims television advertising spend

 New York, June 13 (Reuters): Consumer goods giant Procter amp; Gamble Co is sharply cutting how much it commits in advance to buying television commercials next season, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the situation.

 The move by Cincinnati-based P amp;G, maker of Tide, Crest and Pampers, is the latest sign of rapid changes in how companies reach consumers and TV networks and cable channels draw revenue, the newspaper said.

 People familiar with the situation said P amp;Gs decision to scale back spending on commercials has been disclosed to TV executives in recent weeks during upfront negotiations, the annual round of talks in which advertisers commit to spending for the coming TV season, the report said.

 Its commitments to cable channels will fall by as much as 25 per cent, according to several cable industry and advertising executives, while its spending on broadcast networks will be cut around 5 per cent.

 It also is expected to reduce spending on syndicated daytime talk shows such as The Oprah Winfrey Show and Ellen.

 While cutting back spending on TV commercials, P amp;G is looking to shift money into several different forms of TV marketing. Among them is increased activity in the fast-growing area of product placement ? use of its products on TV shows ? said people familiar with the situation, the Journal reported. 

 P amp;G could not be reached for comment. P amp;G exerts wide influence on how other companies make their marketing and advertising decisions, the newspaper reported. In 2004, the company was the No. 1 US advertiser, spending roughly $2.5 billion on TV ? more than 80 per cent of its estimated $3 billion ad budget.

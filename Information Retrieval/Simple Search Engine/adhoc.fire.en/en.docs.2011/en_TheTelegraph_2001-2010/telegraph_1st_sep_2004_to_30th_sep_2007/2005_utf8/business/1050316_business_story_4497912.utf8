 Focus on agricultural subsidy at G-20 meet

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nath: In control

 New Delhi, March 15: India will host a two-day ministerial conference of the G-20 developing nations from Friday to chalk out a strategy for getting the western nations scale down the huge trade-distorting subsidies that they provide their farmers.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath told journalists that the meeting would come out with a G-20 paper, which would state the position that the developing countries would take in the ongoing agricultural negotiations at the WTO.

 He said the meeting would chalk out concrete milestones in terms of the timeframe and the amount of reduction in subsidy required. The paper would state the position of the G-20 nations in the final run-up to the WTO ministerial to be held in Honk Kong in December.

 As many as 120 delegates will attend the meeting from the G-20 nations, including China, Pakistan, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, Tanzania, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Nigeria and Thailand.

 The minister said G-20 also recognises that most developing countries must garner collective strength to eliminate practices of a small group of producers in rich nations that benefit from enormous financial support from their treasuries. This in turn leads to depressed prices unduly increasing their market share and compromising the food security and livelihood of farmers in many developing countries.

 A number of representatives from alliances of other developing countries such as the G-33, the Africa-Caribbean-Pacific countries and the least developed countries will attend the conference as observers. This is expected to promote a greater understanding and support among developing countries for each other?s positions. Nath said although developing nations had diverse interest, they were still supporting each other in their effort to develop a fair trade order under the WTO.

 He said various studies had highlighted the mammoth subsidies that farmers in rich countries were getting as a result of which they could dump their produce in the global market at prices much lower than the cost of the production.

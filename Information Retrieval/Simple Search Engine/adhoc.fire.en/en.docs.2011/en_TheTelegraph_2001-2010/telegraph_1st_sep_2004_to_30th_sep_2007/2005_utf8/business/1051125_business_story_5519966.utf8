The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Labour unions clueless

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 24: The unions in Dunlop India have been kept in the dark about the negotiations for the takeover and revival of the ailing tyremaker.

 Ashok Pal, vice-president of the Citu-affliated Dunlop Workers Union, said, We have not been informed about the revival talks or the bids that are being submitted by the interested parties. We have come to know that Ruia Cotex has emerged as the frontrunner for Dunlop from media reports.

 Representatives of the Intuc union have also not been informed by the Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction or the state government about the possible revival talks.

 We know that SBI is preparing a package for the company. But we do not know the details. The Ruias will have to circulate the revival scheme among the unions. We are a party to the scheme, the Citu leader added.

 Santoshree Chatterjee, a CPM parliamentarian from Hooghly district who has been trying to revive Dunlop, said he had no idea about Ruias takeover bid. I will have to speak to Nirupam Sen to find out the details.

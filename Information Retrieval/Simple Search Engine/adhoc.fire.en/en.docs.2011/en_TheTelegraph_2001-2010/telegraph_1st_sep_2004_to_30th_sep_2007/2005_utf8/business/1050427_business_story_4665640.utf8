 Roadmap to expand PC network

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 26: India should achieve a PC penetration of 65 per 1,000 persons and Internet penetration of 40 per 1,000 by 2008.

 A high-powered working committee on ?Improving PC penetration, Internet and domestic software? in the country, set up by the ministry of communications and IT, has recommended implementation of a series of mission mode projects. These are critical not only for national development but also essential to reach the target levels of IT penetration in the country. 

 The committee submitted its report to communications and IT minister Dayanidhi Maran today. It comprises eminent professionals in the government, the IT industry, academia and the media.

 The committee has delineated a vision for India that aims to increase the pace of IT penetration in the country and achieve the levels prevailing in China in the next three to four years. It says that by 2008, India should achieve a PC penetration of 65 per 1,000 persons from the existing 14 per 1,000 and Internet penetration of 40 per 1,000 from the existing 5 per 1,000. The domestic software industry, including the local language applications and content industry, should grow seven-fold from the existing $4 billion (Rs 1,900 crore) to $28 billion (Rs 13,300 crore).

 The committee has also said all villages should be made online for agricultural, healthcare and education services; and IT should contribute significantly to the growth of the national GDP.

 The report recommends increasing the IT penetration in India by creating an environment that encourages the domestic development of the entire IT virtuous cycle and eventually leading to attracting investments in IT manufacturing.

 It has recommended the launch of several mission mode projects such as IT-enabled teaching and IT teaching in education; IT deployment for economic development in rural India; telemedicine; affordable computing for homes and SMBs; e-governance; joint industry-government IT usage promotion programme and a roadmap to attract IT manufacturing investments in the country eventually leading to not only a vibrant domestic manufacturing industry but also substantial exports.

 Tax-cut chorus in Ficci serenade

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 4: The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) has urged the government to slash corporate tax rates to 25 per cent for bigger companies and 20 per cent for small firms from the current 30 per cent. The chamber submitted a detailed note to senior officials of the revenue department, ministry of finance, at a recent meeting, which was a run-up to the exercise for the Union Budget 2006-07.

 Listing suggestions across sectors, the chamber called for a 100 per cent tax holiday for at least 10 years for food processing firms. The assessee should be given an option to claim benefit for any 10 consecutive years out of 15, from the time the undertaking begins commercial operations, Ficci president Onkar S. Kanwar said.

 Other recommendations included withdrawal of the fringe benefit tax, introduction of the concept of free depreciation as is the practice in most developed countries and introduction of large taxpayer units. Industry also wants to extend the definition of infrastructure facility to the housing sector.

 It should include integrated township development involving provision of residential, educational, medical, commercial or institutional buildings and creation of required facilities, including roads, water supply, water treatment, sanitation and other civic services, said the note.

 Besides, India Inc has sought a weighted deduction of 150 per cent for research and development of pharmaceutical companies.

 This should be extended for 10-15 years. Also, customs duty exemption on capital goods and raw materials should be extended to all drug companies engaged in R amp;D, the chamber said.

 According to industry, the provisions of the income tax act should be amended so that no witholding tax is applicable to any interest paid by a developer of a special economic zone or a unit located within it.

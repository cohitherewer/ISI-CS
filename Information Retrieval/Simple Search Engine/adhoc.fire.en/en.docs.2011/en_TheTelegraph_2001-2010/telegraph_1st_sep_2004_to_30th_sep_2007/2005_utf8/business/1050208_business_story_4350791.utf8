 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Purwar: Big plans

 Mumbai, Feb. 7: State Bank of India (SBI) will pay close to $8 million to buy a 51 per cent stake in the Indian Ocean International Bank (IOIB) in Mauritius.

 SBI plans to integrate the bank with its international business to focus on the retail segment, chairman and managing director A. K. Purwar said today on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Indian Merchants? Chamber.

 Purwar said the bank would continue to look at acquisition opportunities, even as it plans to grow through the inorganic route in Africa and Asia.

 ?SBI already has operations in Mauritius and the acquisition will strengthen our presence in the country, especially in the retail sector, Purwar added.

 SBI has been looking at Mauritius to capitalise on the sizeable number of citizens of Indian origin. The island state is also famous for industries like textiles, tourism and retail. In addition, SBI feels the country could be a gateway to other nations. 

 Till last year, SBI had 54 offices spread across 31 countries. The bank plans to take the number to 70 offices covering 36 countries by the end of this financial year.

 IOIB, which is listed on the Mauritius Stock Exchange, was founded in 1978 and has about 150 employees on its payroll.

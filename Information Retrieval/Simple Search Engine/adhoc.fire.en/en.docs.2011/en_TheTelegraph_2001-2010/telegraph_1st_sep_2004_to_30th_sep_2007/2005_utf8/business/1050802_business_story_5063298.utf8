 Intelenet overcomes adversity

 SATISH JOHN

 Mumbai, Aug. 1: The operations of Intelenet Global Services were hampered in the morning as rains forced many of its employees to stay at home. However, in the evening, office transport helped employees reach the BPO firm in time to cater to the clients in the UK and other parts of Europe.

 The company, which is promoted by HDFC Ltd and the UK-based Barclays Bank, saw senior executives battling against the advisories posted by Mumbai Police asking citizens to stay indoors because of inclement weather.

 CEO Susir Kumar desperately urged the employees to reach office at least by evening, when its peak working hours begin.

 We have asked the television guys to tone down their warnings that discouraged people from travelling, Kumar said to The Telegraph.

 We have checked with the control rooms and none of the crucial arterial roads are water-clogged, he added. 

 BPO administrators like Susir Kumar are worried as their businesses would be affected if they cannot cope with the pressure in the evening from clients abroad. 

 Intelenet has 4000 employees and operates from Malad and Mahape, two distant suburbs in the city situated far away from each other. Like most BPOs, Intelenet operates 200 buses to bring their employees to work and reach them home.

 Intelenet was in the news in July when it worked overtime to help British train passengers find their way after the London bombings.

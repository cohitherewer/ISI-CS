 Calcutta, May 3: Indo-Thai bilateral trade is poised to register a growth of 30 per cent this year from $2 billion last year.

 ?Growth will come from higher trade in construction material, automobile components, computer material and food processing segment,? said Kunyaphan Raengkhunas, a senior Thai commerce ministry official, while addressing a session organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce.

 The trade between the two countries will further improve after a deep sea port is set up on the Bangkok side within the next 12 months, Raengkhunas, who is the deputy director general in the export promotion department of Thai commerce ministry, said. At present, all vessels have to go via Singapore and it is expected that the new port will substantially reduce the sailing time.

 ?We are looking for joint venture partners for investment both within the country and in Thailand and are currently exploring opportunities,? Raengkhunas added. Currently, the bilateral trade between the two countries is tilted in favour of India.

 The delegation from Thailand consists of 12 companies and they have met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen and IT secretary G. D. Gautama.

 ?We are keen on exploring investment opportunities presented by the state, which we feel is the gateway to India,? Raengkhunas added.

 The Thailand companies are interested in the fields of floriculture, food processing, auto components and computers.

 ?Both parties will benefit from joint ventures since West Bengal has expertise in software while we have in hardware,? said Raengkhunas.

 According to the Thai trade official, 120 Thai companies would participate in a joint exhibition in October at the Netaji Indoor Stadium to promote trade between the countries. 

 ?The present delegation of 12 companies is a curtain raiser to the exhibition,? he said.

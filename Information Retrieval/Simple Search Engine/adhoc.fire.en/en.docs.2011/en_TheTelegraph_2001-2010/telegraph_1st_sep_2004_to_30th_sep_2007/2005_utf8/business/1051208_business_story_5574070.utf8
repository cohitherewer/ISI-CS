 Calcutta, Dec. 7: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wants PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to conduct a study to turn around the states worn-out transport system.

 The state transport system is in a bad shape. There are so many state transport corporations but they are not functioning properly. So much subsidy is being given but it is not working, the chief minister said while inaugurating PwCs state-of-the-art global training centre at Salt Lake.

 Bhattacharjee said, PwC and Bengal share a relationship that goes back 125 years. PwC is already engaged in restructuring the West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB). After that is completed, maybe PwC can look into this as well.

 PwC, which is celebrating its 125th year of operations in India, has set up a 100,000-sq-ft facility. It will house its global training centre and will also be the hub for its knowledge process outsourcing activities. 

 PwC chairman and CEO Rathin Datta said, There is a huge need for training. The demographics are changing rapidly. The economic balance is shifting towards the Asian countries. However, professionals in this part of the world have to be trained to meet the demands of global markets.

 The centre will ensure complete data security and business continuity, in accordance with PwCs international best practices. 

 This is a tribute to the relationship between PwC and India and the countrys economy. It is a small measure of how much the country has contributed to the companys success, managing director Roopen Roy said.

 With corporate governance evolving at a great pace, the need to morph human resources and talent has been felt keenly. The services sector is about human resources and talent. The knowledge industry is transforming the way the world looks at India. It will contribute to every industry by optimising all available resources. The PwC global training centre can reinforce our biggest asset ? our population, Nasscom vice-president B. Ramalinga Raju said.

 The training centre will be operational by February 2006.

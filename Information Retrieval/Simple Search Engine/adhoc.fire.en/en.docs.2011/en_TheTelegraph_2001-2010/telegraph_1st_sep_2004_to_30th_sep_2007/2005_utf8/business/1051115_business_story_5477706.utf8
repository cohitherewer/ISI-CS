 BoR to raise $100 m to fund buyouts

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Tayal: Reaching out

 Calcutta, Nov. 14: Bank of Rajasthan (BoR) has firmed up plans to float a $100-million global depository receipts (GDR) issue next year. The money so raised will be used to fund acquisitions and shore up the banks capital base. 

 BoR chairman Pravin Kumar Tayal said, The GDR will be floated sometime in 2006. We cannot give a definite timeframe right now. 

 One of the objectives of the proposed GDR is to fund BoRs plan to acquire a south India-based bank. We are looking at a bank which has a strong presence in the southern part of the country. Typically, the bank should have 100-200 branches. 

 BoR doesnt have a strong presence in south India ? it has only 16 branches there. We have already sent feelers to some of the banks based in south India, added Tayal. However, he refused to name them. 

 BoR has a strong presence in north India ? mostly in Rajasthan and Punjab. It has 432 branches spread all over the country. 

 The Tayal family, which is mainly into the yarn business, has a 44.16 per cent stake in BoR, which it has acquired from Keshav Bangur in 1999.

 After the GDR, the holding of the Tayal family in BoR will come down to 25 per cent. 

 Talking about the financial health of the bank, Tayal said that the capital adequacy ratio of the bank stood at 14 per cent against the Reserve Bank of Indias norm of 9 per cent. 

 After the GDR issue, the CAR will go up to 20 per cent. This will be enough to take care of the capital requirement under the Basel-II regime, Tayal added. 

 The net non-performing assets of the bank stands at 2 per cent compared with 48 per cent when the Tayals took over the bank. Its total deposits grew to Rs 9,000 crore. 

 The banks cost of funds is also low at 4.5 per cent and it is believed that post-GDR the cost will come down further. 

 Tayal said that the bank would focus more on retail lending and on small and medium enterprises as the returns are better in these two sectors. They are more remunerative for small banks like us, he said. 

 Among the retail sectors, BoR is banking more on the housing loan than others. This sector is witnessing a tremendous growth and the trend is expected to continue in the next few years, Tayal said.

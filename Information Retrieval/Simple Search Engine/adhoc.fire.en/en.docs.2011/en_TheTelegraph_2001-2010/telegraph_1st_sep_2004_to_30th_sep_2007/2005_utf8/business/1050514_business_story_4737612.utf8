 Rallis cashes in on rejig 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 13: Rallis Indias restructuring exercise, spanning over several years, has finally paid off. The Tata groups agrochemicals company has reported profits and returned to the dividend list after three years.

 Profits after exceptional items stood at Rs 38.15 crore compared with a loss of Rs 46.66 crore in the previous year. This increase of over Rs 84 crore was entirely from operations, the company said.

 Ralliss focus on its core pesticides business has generated a 26 per cent rise in sales in a year when the industry posted a 14 per cent growth.

 Managing director V. S. Sohoni said the companys fourth quarter results are not comparable with the corresponding previous quarter. During the quarter, the company had earned a profit of Rs 4.01 crore. It had posted Rs 15.09-crore profit in the same period previous year. 

 Last year the company had earned Rs 44 crore by divesting its gelatine business and Rs 56 crore by selling the Rallis House.

 Major restructuring is behind us, Sohoni said.

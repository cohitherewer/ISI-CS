 Birlas to cash in on antiques in will war

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 5: As the inheritance controversy enters the next round with an array of antiques tumbling out of an almirah at Priyamvada Birlas Gurusaday Dutt Road residence, the Birla family plans to use this discovery as its trump card in their battle against Rajendra Singh Lodha. 

 While he (Lodha) claimed that he was a confidant of Priyamvada, he did not disclose the existence of the strong room and neither did he give any indication about the existence of such valuable items in his affidavit. This is nothing but concealment, said a source close to the Birla family. The court-appointed special officers stumbled upon a treasure trove at Birla Park last week as they broke open an almirah in the strong room.

 Though no confirmation was forthcoming, special officers entrusted with the responsibility of preparing an inventory of Priyamvadas personal assets have chanced upon around 50 to 60 rare Jaipur Coins and a number of old European coins. These items were found stashed in wooden boxes in one of the shelves of an old Godrej almirah.

 Madhav Prasad babu (MP Birla) had a hobby of collecting coins and people close to him knew about his collection, which was kept under lock and key in the strong room, explained the source.

 With the discovery of over 300 antique gold coins, dating back to the Gupta, Maurya and Mughal periods, the treasure trove has taken centrestage in the most controversial succession drama of India Inc in recent times.

 The Lodha camp has maintained that the affidavit of assets ? accompanying the chartered accountants probate petition ? was based on Priyamvadas disclosure to the income tax authorities. Special efforts were made to keep her belongings intact, claimed the Lodha side. 

 The strong room and the assets found will become the fulcrum of our case against Lodha, said the source, adding that more such antique items would spill out of three almirahs and safes yet to be opened.

 We think the number of coins will be over 400. They are dated between 200 AD and 1600 AD. These are invaluable items and we are planning to demand a valuation from auction houses like Christies, said a Birla confidant. 

 The Birla family will also highlight the issue of non-availability of keys to the safes and almirahs at Priyamvadas residence.

 Despite being a trusted man of Priyamvada, he (Lodha) could produce only four keys, which couldnt open almirahs and safes. But later, special officers found more than 60 keys from the bungalow that was under Lodhas custody, added the source.

 Special officers Ahin Chowdhury, Ashoke Banerjee, I.P. Mukherjee and Pradeep Ghosh have completed the listing of other items like tea sets and flower vases. They will take up the inventory of these coins from Thursday.

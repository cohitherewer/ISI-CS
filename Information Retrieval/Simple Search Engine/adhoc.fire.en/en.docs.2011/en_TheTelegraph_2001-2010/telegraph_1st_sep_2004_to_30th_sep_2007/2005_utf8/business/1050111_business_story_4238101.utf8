 ONGC gets go-ahead to bid for Yukos assets

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: The government has cleared Oil and Natural Gas Corporation?s (ONGC) proposal to bid for the assets of Russia?s oil giant Yukos, which has already been put on the block.

 Subir Raha, chairman and managing director of ONGC, said, ?We never had any intention to bid for Yukos, but were interested in its assets. We are pursuing that opportunity now and have the required authorisation to go ahead in our efforts to finalise the transaction.?

 The proposed purchase is expected to cost ONGC up to $2 billion, but Raha, who spoke to newspersons here after media leaks on the issue, refused to comment on the outlay for the project.

 Sources said the plan is to buy a 15 per cent stake in Yuganskneftegaz, the former crown jewel of the embattled Yukos Oil Company, through ONGC?s 100 per cent subsidiary ? ONGC Videsh.

 However, ONGC officials said negotiations were at an early stage and the company was worried about multi-billion dollar tax claims on Yukos.

 Raha said, ?I will not be able to give any details at this point of time because of the commercial confidentiality agreement we have entered into.?

 Raha said the state-run company was also looking at opportunities in other oil and gas assets in Russia. ?We are in contact with the entities concerned to see to what extent we can go forward and whether we can negotiate some mutually beneficial terms,? he said.

 He also said ONGC was in the race for picking up Canadian firm Encana?s stake in a cluster of oil fields in Ecuador. ?We have bid (for Encana oil fields),? Raha said.

 ONGC Videsh, the company?s foreign arm, has bid for the assets, which include the Canadian firm?s stake in the Amazon blocks 14, 17 and Tarapoa, with a combined output of 66,891 barrels of oil per day.

 ONGC Videsh is pitched against PetroChina for the Encana assets and is believed to have made a better offer than the Chinese company.

 Raha, however, refused to divulge details of the bid.

 ?As we understand from reports, there are three companies in the race, one of them being a western oil firm,? he said.

 Asked if ONGC was interested in buying out US energy firm Unocal, Raha said, ?We have not taken any stand on that...We are aware of that (Unocal being up for sale).?

 ONGC is seeking overseas petroleum assets as its domestic output has declined and no large fields have been discovered recently in India, which imports 70 per cent of its crude oil requirements.

 ONGC Videsh has operations in 10 countries, including Vietnam, Russia, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Myanmar and Australia, and has the backing of the oil ministry, which wants the company to spend at least $1 billion a year to acquire foreign operations.

 Encana has a 36.26 per cent stake in a new 450,000 bpd heavy crude pipeline from the Amazon oil blocks to the Pacific coast, and has reserved space to ship more than 108,000 bpd.

 It also owns a 40 per cent stake in oil block 15, operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp. Ecuador has threatened to withdraw Occidental?s contract for awarding this stake without obtaining permission from authorities.

 Raha said ONGC was pursuing other opportunities in Russia, including Sakhlain-3. ONGC is a partner with Rosneft in the $4.5-billion ExxonMobil-led Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project off Siberia?s coast. Each has a 20 per cent stake.

 Raha also revealed that ONGC?s retail operations will begin by the end of this fiscal and will focus on the highways and metropolitan suburbs. The first outlet will come up in Mangalore.

 The reason for focusing on suburbs and highways is because of the difficulty and high cost of land in cities, Raha said.

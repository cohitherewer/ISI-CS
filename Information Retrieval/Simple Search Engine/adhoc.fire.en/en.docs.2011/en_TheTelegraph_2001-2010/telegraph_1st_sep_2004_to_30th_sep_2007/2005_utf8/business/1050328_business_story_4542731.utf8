The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Mallya ready for slugfest in the sky

 Mallya: Flying high

 Mumbai, March 27: Vijay Mallya?s Rs 4000-crore UB group has set its sights on the domestic skies, where it hopes to make an impact with Kingfisher Airlines.

 ?This time there will be real competition in the Indian skies,? UB group chairman Vijay Mallya said. The group is readying to take off in the domestic civil aviation sector in a big way.

 ?I know how to compete, and the world knows it,? Mallya told The Telegraph when asked whether the domestic skies are overcrowded and whether his airline will make a difference.

 Kingfisher Airlines will be unveiled on May 7 ? the day when his son Siddharth will complete 18 years. Commercial operations will start from May 9 with two Airbus planes flying between Bangalore and Mumbai. 

 Kingfisher Airlines has booked 33 aircraft ? a mix of A320s and 319s. Mallya said Airbus Industrie would supply two planes every month from May. 

 Kingfisher Airlines will have a comfortable seating arrangement with around 170 seats with attached video screens and free full meals at a competitive price as it targets first-class train passengers.

 Mallya, known more for his flamboyance and style, takes pains to explain that when it comes to business, he is a true professional. ?I have a highly professional team to assist me,? he said.

 One of them is Alex Wilcox, an expert on low-cost airlines, who has been appointed as the president and CEO of Kingfisher Airlines. Wilcox was part of the core team that set up JetBlue, the US low-cost airline that reported a profit from the first year of operations.

 Wilcox has also got on board professionals from JetBlue like Robert Murphy and Pete Adler, who are experts in airport systems and corporate planning to help him set up the fledgling airline.

 UB Holdings, the listed holding company, will own 100 per cent equity in Kingfisher Airlines. Like other airlines, 85 per cent of the funding will be sought from credit agencies in Europe.

 There is also a buzz in the aviation sector that Mallya may give a minority stake to Richard Branson of Virgin Airlines.

 Mallya, who has been snapping up companies in the liquor segment, is not concerned about the source of money to fund the acquisitions and the fresh investments in airlines.

 ?The next step is to make a global acquisition,? he said referring to his liquor business. ?I have restructured and I have divested some businesses,? he added. 

 On whether he will divest non-core businesses like Mangalore Chemicals and Fertilisers, Mallya said, ?The company is making an annual profit of Rs 25 crore. Why should I sell it??

 Rumours are rife that some similar liquor brands (from the Shaw Wallace portfolio) will be sold for a neat profit. Grapevine has it that Mallya has also lined up a strategic investor at a handsome price for his liquor business, which will be restructured into UB Spirits. He is not evasive when he says he could consider at the right price.

 However, he is not in a hurry, he clarified.

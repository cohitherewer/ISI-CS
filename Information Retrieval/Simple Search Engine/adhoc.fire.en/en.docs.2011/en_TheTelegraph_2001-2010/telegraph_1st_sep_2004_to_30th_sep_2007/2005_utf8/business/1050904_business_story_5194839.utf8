 Paswan: Good news

 Burnpur Sept. 3: Union steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan today announced a Rs 8,017-crore modernisation package for the Indian Iron amp; Steel Company?s (IISCO) Burnpur unit. The minister also announced a 25 per cent salary increment for the 16,000 employees of IISCO.

 The announcement follows the recent merger of IISCO with SAIL. The Union cabinet had approved the merger in June this year. 

 ?The salaries would be increased according to SAIL?s norms ? the increment will be at least 25 per cent of the present salary,? Paswan said. 

 ?Steel Authority of India has planned a Rs 8,017-crore modernisation and upgradation package for the IISCO plant. Work has already begun at the plant and will be completed by 2012. The entire money will be provided by SAIL,? Paswan said. He was on a day?s visit to the IISCO plant here. 

 According to the minister, about Rs 5,017 crore will be spent on the modernisation of machines at the Burnpur plant, Rs 2,000 crore will be used to upgrade the iron and coal mines owned by IISCO and the remaining Rs 1,000 crore will be kept for importing coking coal. 

 The plant?s capacity will be increased to 2.5 million tonnes (mt) of hot metal per year against 1.5 mt at present. Crude iron production will also increase to about 4.6 mt per year compared with 3.6 mt now. Post expansion, the Burnpur plant will produce 11 mt of saleable steel a year against 2.9 mt at present. 

 In response to the reopening of the Kulti Works ? another IISCO plant lying closed for a couple of years ? Paswan said the government was ?thinking on positive lines? about the matter. ?The plant was shut down by the former NDA government as it had been suffering losses,? he said. ?We are discussing with the state government about the future of the Kulti unit,? he added.

 UB gains height with Airbus plane

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 20: The UB group ? the parent company of Kingfisher Airlines ? will buy an Airbus Corporate Jetliner (ACJ), becoming the first Indian customer to do so.

 The aircraft, to be delivered in the summer of 2006, will be powered by International Aero Engines V2500s, a statement issued by Airbus said.

 In the world of business, time is money, and a corporate jetliner is a vital tool that can help our company save both, said UB group chairman Vijay Mallya.

 My philosophy has always been to strive for the best ? in the products of the UB group as well as in the way we run our business ? so it should come as no surprise that the company has chosen the ACJ, he added.

 Kingfisher Airlines had started domestic services earlier this month, using a new fleet of Airbus A320s, featuring the widest seats in its class and personal TV screens. 

 Its fly the good times approach capitalises on the emerging market of the younger generation in the country.

 We are delighted to have UB group as our first ACJ customer in India, and look forward to delivering a productive asset that will make full use of the unmatched spaciousness that the aircrafts cabin offers, said Airbus vice-president executive and private aviation Richard Gaona. 

 The ACJ has twice the width of traditional business jets and three times the volume. However, it costs about the same as competing top-of-the-line business jets.

 In addition to the modern airframe of the A319, the ACJ family features up to six extra fuel tanks in the cargo hold for increased intercontinental range and a higher cruise altitude of 41,000 ft.

 These features make the ACJ aircraft a powerfully productive business tool. The ACJ can fly 10 executives in a VIP layout up to 11,100 km, enough to fly non-stop routes from Delhi or Mumbai to London. It can also carry 48 passengers in exclusive comfort up to 8,300 km.

 ONGC aircraft

 ONGC has entered into a memorandum of understanding with Indian Airlines for leasing two aircraft for ferrying its personnel to operational locations and work centres especially for crisis management. 

 The seating capacity of the aircraft will be 9 and 12 but the pact incorporates a flexibility clause to change this configuration when required. ONGC is retaining an option to convert the lease into purchase during the currency of the lease contract at agreed terms.

 According to the MoU, Indian Airlines will also enter into a service contract for the operation and maintenance of these aircraft. The pilots and cabin crew will be provided by Indian Airlines and the company will also be responsible for the safety of the fleet and the passengers.

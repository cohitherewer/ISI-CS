 Bengal records fastest service sector growth

 GARIMA SINGH

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: Bengal is the fastest-growing state in the services sector with a 25 per cent growth between 2001-2004, an Assocham study has said. 

 Within the services sector, banking and insurance grew 56 per cent, followed by financing, real estate and other business services at 43 per cent.

 Big companies like Infosys, which are keen to set up software operations in Bengal, speak volumes about the pace with which the state is moving under chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, said Assocham president Mahendra K. Sanghi. 

 Bengal is part of a league of states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu in terms of growth of gross domestic product (GDP) between 2001-2004.

 The state, which is aggressively seeking foreign direct investment, saw a growth of 15 per cent in its GDP at constant prices and 23 per cent at current prices, which puts it at the second slot after Gujarat.

 State GDP has increased from Rs 91,836 crore in 2001-02 to Rs 1,05,806 crore in 2003-04. 

 Industry in Bengal grew 9 per cent with the manufacturing sector making up 67 per cent.

 In terms of state output, Bengal is next only to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.

 Bengal is trying to get into the mainstream of economy. Competitiveness is all about productivity at low cost. The state must focus on this aspect and it will be a great success with the huge manpower it has, Biocon chairman Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said. 

 Bengal has bagged the eighth position with FDI approvals at Rs 8,802 crore up to 2002.

 It is true that the general impression about Bengal is improving. There is a change in the states stand on foreign direct investment and an improvement in its services sector, said Lalit Suri, chairman and managing director of Bharat Hotels. 

 The study states that an interaction with the countrys top CEOs revealed that after Bhattacharjee took over as chief minister in May 2001 the states image has changed. 

 Recently, the chief minister had also made efforts to attract FDI from the Salem Group, despite political opposition.

 The CEOs feel that if IT majors establish their operations in the state, it will be a right match for the pool of human resources available in Bengal.

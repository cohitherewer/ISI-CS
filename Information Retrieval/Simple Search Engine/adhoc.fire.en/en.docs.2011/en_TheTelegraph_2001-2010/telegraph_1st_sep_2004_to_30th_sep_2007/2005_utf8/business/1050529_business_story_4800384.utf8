 SBI to help Haldia in Basell deal

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, May 28: State Bank of India has agreed to raise $300 million foreign currency loans for Haldia Petrochemicals Limited (HPL).

 The money, to be raised through the external commercial borrowing route, is for investment in Basell Polyolefins ? the Dutch petrochem giant that The Chatterjee Group-led consortium has taken over after several rounds of bidding.

 Purnendu Chatterjee, one of the principal promoters of HPL, today communicated to the board members about SBIs plan to provide loans to HPL for investing in Basell. 

 The ECB route is beneficial for HPL as it provides foreign currency funds that may not be available in India. Moreover, the cost of funds at times works out to be cheaper when compared with rupee funds. 

 The international market can be a source of big funds compared to the domestic market and companies can raise large sums at competitive prices depending on the risk perception of the international market through the ECB route.

 We would like to provide loans to HPL for investing in Basell. It will mean good business for us, senior officials of State Bank of India told The Telegraph from Mumbai.

 On May 12, HPLs lenders, led by Industrial Development Bank of India, had, in-principle, cleared the proposed investment in Basell Polyolefins.

 Talking to newspersons today at the end of the three-hour board meeting, Purnendu said: Basell is a complex issue and a lot of things have to be sorted out in the European Union before cash transactions take place.

 The TCG chief has also approached other banks for loans so that HPL can invest in Basell.

 On whether HPL will remain a minority shareholder in Basell, Purnendu said, At this point it is very difficult to say what will be HPLs stake in Basell.

 However, sources say HPL will remain a minority shareholder in Basell.

 HPLs participation in Basell hinges on how fast Purnendu buys out the states stake in the company. The Bengal government is not in favour of HPL investing in Basell as they feel the company has just registered a profit and is not in a position to become an equity partner in Basell by raising loans. 

 On the contrary, Purnendu feels that if HPL becomes an equity partner of Basell it will be able to access the technologies of the Dutch company.

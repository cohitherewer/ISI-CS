 Titan ready with rights issue

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 31: Titan Industries, a Tata group company, today announced a Rs 127-crore rights issue to part-finance its ambitious expansion plans. The issue consists of partly convertible debentures (PCD) priced at Rs 600 each in the ratio of one PCD for every 20 shares held by shareholders.

 Titan Industries has informed the bourses that the PCDs will have two parts. Part A will be converted into one equity share in a price band of Rs 325 to Rs 375. 

 Part B will be one non-convertible debenture, which will carry a coupon rate of 6.75 per cent per annum payable annually and redeemable at the end of five years. The total issue size will be around Rs 126.83 crore comprising over 21.13 lakh PCDs of Rs 600 each.

 On the Bombay Stock Exchange today, the Titan scrip opened at Rs 494.45, touched the days high of Rs 507.20 and closed at Rs 495.65. Around 5.23 lakh shares were transacted, which resulted in a turnover of Rs 26.17 crore.

 Titan will use the proceeds to part-finance the expansion of its existing businesses. Reports suggest it is evaluating new business lines as well. These include broadening its presence in the precision engineering business by venturing into new sectors and the mass jewellery market. The company, which posted a sales figure of Rs 1,135 crore in 2004-05, is targeting a topline of around Rs 4000 crore over the next four years.

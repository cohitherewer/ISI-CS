 General Electric, Trehan ink deal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 26: General Electric Healthcare and Dr Naresh Trehan, the well-known cardio-surgeon from Escorts, today signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a $250-million healthcare facility called Medicity.

 Medicity is a multi-speciality hospital where different streams like cardiac care, orthopaedics, paediatrics and several more will be under one roof. Also, we will have traditional systems of medicine, said Medicity chairman Trehan.

 Under the terms of the agreement, Trehan and a few other private investors will stump up the money, while GE will provide the technical support.

 Scott R. Bayman, president and CEO of GE India, however, said the company would consider equity infusion into the project at a later date, if required.

 GE India and Medicity will collaborate on a number of initiatives to develop state-of-the-art diagnostic and research and development.

 These will be in the area of high-end medical diagnostics, clinical research and development, utility services like power generation and distribution, lighting, water treatment and other environment-friendly solutions.

 Displaying the model of what he called a green hospital, Trehan said, We have all resources, manpower and technological tie-ups in place. So construction should begin next month.

 This is GEs first collaborative venture worldwide. Globally, GE has a healthcare business of $15 billion.

 Speaking on the occasion, Jeffrey Immelt, chairman and CEO of GE, said, We make technology and realise that healthcare collaborations outside the US can be very effective.

 Slated to be built over a 43-acre plot in Gurgaon (near Delhi), Medicity is scheduled to be inaugurated on Indias 60th anniversary of independence.

 Focusing on the need for healthcare services for the rural sector, Kapil Sibal, Union minister of science and technology, said healthcare was important for the government-initiated Bharat Nirman project.

 It is the responsibility of research and development organisations to prepare technology to reach out to those people who cannot afford medical care, he said.

 India has the advantage of being a low-cost economy with adequate human resources. 

 According to Sibal, Indias future lies in the field of integrated medicines. He informed that the ministry is in the process of preparing a database of all traditional medicines. This will be done with the help of the department of biotechnology.

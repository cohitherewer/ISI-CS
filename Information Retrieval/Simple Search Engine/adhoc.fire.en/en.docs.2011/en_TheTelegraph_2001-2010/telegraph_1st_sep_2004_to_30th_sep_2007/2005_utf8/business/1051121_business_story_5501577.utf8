 Malls build talent shield

 RUMBLES ON THE SHOP FLOOR

 Mumbai, Nov. 20: Employee stock options (ESOP), the fabled staff-retention device that shone through in the high noon of dotcom boom, are now spreading to mall majors.

 The move comes at a time when retailers in India are gearing up for competition from global giants who will storm in once the government decides to open its doors to them. 

 So, while local players ramp up their presence in key cities before the likes of Wal-Mart arrive, they are also aware that their employees could be vulnerable to poaching.

 One of those that have moved swiftly is Shoppers Stop, which launched its ESOPs, but not for the first time. Others such as Piramyd Retail and Pantaloon (Retail) India are showering other benefits in an industry where attrition levels are as high as 40 per cent.

 At Shoppers Stop, the company promoted by the Rahejas, the ESOPs form only one aspect of its plan to preserve talent. B.S. Nagesh, managing director and CEO, said the fresh round of stock options were its fifth. The first was introduced in 2001. This forms part of the philosophy that basic business is run by employees. Therefore, the issue is how wealth should be created for them and ownership brought about, he told The Telegraph.

 Ruling out the idea that this round of ESOPs is connected to the issue of FDI that will eventually be allowed in the industry, Nagesh said the objective is to cover more employees. The option is expected to cover around 100 employees, which will include managerial staff like store managers and heads of merchandise among others.

 At Shoppers Stop, however, ESOPs are not the only bait to keep staff. Nagesh revealed that the company has been engaged in creating an environment of transparency, apart from training employees and creating wealth. We even have an employee-satisfaction index, which is now running for the fifth year.

 At Pantaloon Retail, ESOPs have not arrived but, Sanjay Jog, head of its human resources, says the company looks at its employees on a holistic basis not as a transaction. 

 We look at needs. If an employee has a house, he needs to fill it. In our context, this is easy since we peddle all the goods that go to make a home, he said.

 Jog also speaks about an employee growth fund, which will invest in growth instruments like stocks and property. He is confident the plan will be as attractive as an ESOP. It could even offer better appreciation.

 Krish Iyer, managing director and CEO of Piramyd Retail, concedes demand for people will go up as the foreign retailers arrive. With that, salaries, too, will go up.

 Piramyd, which recently floated an initial public offering (IPO) to fund its expansion, will offer both financial and non-financial benefits to retain talent within.

 Marginal drop in inflation rate

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 13: The rate of inflation dipped marginally by 0.24 per cent to touch 5.67 per cent for the week ended April 30. After rising for four consecutive weeks, the inflation rate fell mainly due to cheaper food and manufactured products like edible oils.

 The point-to-point wholesale price index (WPI) inflation rate fell from the previous weeks level of 5.91 per cent. It was 4.60 per cent in the same period last year. 

 For the current financial year, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had estimated the inflation rate to be 5-5.5 per cent. However, being cautious on its outlook, the central bank had said it may get moderated by the oil-price movement, which remains tight.

 Although fuel prices remained unchanged, the WPI rose by 0.1 per cent to 192.1 points due to a surge in the index of heavy-weighted manufactured products. The index was 181.8 points a year ago. 

 During the week under review, international oil prices closed below $50 a barrel for the first time in more than two months on rising US supplies and slower economic growth.

 The government revised the inflation rate upwards to 5.46 per cent during the week ended March 5 compared with a provisional estimate of 5.30 per cent. The WPI stood corrected at 189.2 points during the first week of March against the provisional level of 188.9 points.

 The index of primary articles group was down by 0.1 per cent to 188.5 points, mainly due to cheaper food articles although non-food items became costlier. The index was 185.8 points in the year-ago period.

 Food articles group index fell by 0.2 per cent to 190.3 points due to lower prices for eggs (5 per cent), wheat and fruits (1 per cent each), while prices of fish-marine and urad rose by 2 per cent each and barley by 1 per cent.

 The index of non-food articles group was up by 0.2 per cent to 179.4 points due to costlier raw rubber (4 per cent), sunflower and groundnut seeds (2 per cent each) and safflower and raw silk (1 per cent each).

 Prices, however, declined in the case of linseed and soyabean (3 per cent each), castor and niger seeds (2 per cent each) and fodder (1 per cent).

 US pledges deep cut in farm subsidy

 Zurich, Oct. 10 (Reuters): The United States on Monday proposed deep cuts in farm subsidies and the future elimination of farm tariffs in what it said was a bid to unblock world trade talks, which face an end-year deadline for a deal.

 US trade chief Rob Portman said his country was willing to accept some pain to win an agreement opening the way to a new pact that analysts say could pump billions of dollars into the global economy and help lift millions out of poverty.

 The plan, detailed by Portman at a Zurich news conference, was to be put to a meeting of trade ministers in the Swiss business capital later on Monday.

 The US today is taking a risk ... It is stepping forward, and it is my sincere hope that it (the plan) will jump-start the talks, Portman said, referring to stalled negotiations at the Geneva-based World Trade Organisation (WTO).

 The initial reaction of other ministers was positive, but some said they needed more detail to assess the plan.

 The European Union will match ? and indeed go substantially beyond ? the 60 per cent cut in the most trade-distorting support proposed by the US, European trade commissioner Peter Mandelson said in a statement.

 But it was unclear whether the EU, which has offered to slash its own trade-distorting farm subsidies by 65 per cent in return for a 55 per cent cut by the United States, would bow to US demands for even deeper reductions.

 Mandelson was among 23 trade and farm ministers coming to Zurich on Monday for a meeting of key developed and developing WTO member countries.

 The 148-state WTO needs to agree a blueprint for the final stage of its Doha Round at a ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December, but negotiations are snagged on a host of issues, with agriculture the most pressing. 

 The Round, due to be completed by the end of 2006, aims to lower barriers to trade across the global economy, but poorer countries are demanding deep cuts to farm subsidies they say stop them competing on world markets.

 UN secretary-general Kofi Annan in Geneva voiced strong support for that stance, declaring the poor would only be really helped by a genuinely free and fair trading system.

 Delicensing kept in place for now

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The Supreme Court today stayed an Allahabad High Court judgment which had ruled that delicensing through notifications by the executive (the government) was bad in law. 

 The apex court will now take up the case for the next hearing in November. For the interim period, it has stayed the implications of the high court judgment.

 The high court had said Parliament should take up the issue of delicensing through a law repealing the Industries (development amp; regulation) Act 1951 that brought in the entire regime of licensing in the first place. Power of delicensing, if any, is an exclusive policy matter and within the domain of essential legislative competence, stated the lower court judgment delivered in August 24 this year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 AGMs set to go high-tech

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, March 16: Amit Ghosh, 49, a government employee from Calcutta, always wanted to attend the annual general meeting of IPCL. However, since the meetings are held in Vadodara, he has to spend a lot of time and energy to participate.

 In the near future, Ghosh might easily attend these meetings through video-conferencing from some designated place in Calcutta itself.

 Even though it seems futuristic, this may soon become a reality if the recommendations of the National Investor Foundation (NIF) are taken into account by the JJ Irani Committee, which is preparing draft guidelines for changes in the Companies Act. 

 The foundation has suggested that companies with a market capitalisation of Rs 250 crore and above should hold their AGMs through video conferences to ensure corporate democracy and appropriate representation of shareholders.

 Sudip Bandyopadhyay, a trustee of the foundation, said cities might be notified based on the concentration of shareholders in them. 

 ?The criteria for selection may be 1 per cent of the total number of outstanding shares and/or 1 per cent of the voting rights,? he said.

 A large number of companies with wide shareholder bases hold AGMs in small towns and cities, which are inaccessible for most people. As a result, majority representations do not take place.

 For instance, Indo-Gulf Corporation of the Aditya Birla Group holds its AGM in Jagdishpur. The Jaiprakash group holds the AGM for most of its companies in Luknow.

 The views of NIF were tabled before Dr J J Irani in Mumbai today. The committee is supposed to recommend amendments to the Companies Act. 

 The committee is expected to come up with its suggestions before the department of company affairs (DCA).

 Apart from the demand of holding AGM through video conferencing, NIF has sought changes in the Companies Act relating to mergers and amalgamation.

 It has recommended that an appropriate price discovery mechanism, coupled with an exit option, should be provided to the dissenting minority shareholders in case of a merger of two companies.

 For unlisted companies, the method followed should be on the lines of the provisions of the RBI Act. It provides for an RBI-appointed valuer determining the fair value of shares of dissenting shareholders and the same being settled in cash by the transferee company.

 In case of listed companies, NIF suggested that the value of the shares of the transferor company should be determined through the reverse book-building method, along the lines of the Sebi-approved delisting guidelines.

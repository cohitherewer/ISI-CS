 Crude freight rates go scuba diving

 Mumbai, May 31: Ocean freight rates for crude have slumped in the month of May, making it the steepest fall in recent years.

 The rates have dropped 36.81 per cent to $23,003 per day for very large crude carriers (VLCCs) compared with $36,404 per day in April. 

 The decline has been as sharp as 60 per cent compared with the year-ago figure.

 ?There has been a significant correction in the VLCC rates from their peaks in October-November 2004,? shipping industry officials said. 

 In November, VLCC freight rates were $1,52,855 per day. Rates have dropped 85 per cent since then. 

 There has been a steady decline in spot rates, officials said. ?In January and March this year, the spot rates declined. In February there was a spike,? an industry official explained.

 ?At present, the spot rates are hovering in the $21,000-per-day range. The volatility has been quiet high when compared with the other asset classes,? the official added.

 An analyst tracking the shipping industry said a slew of factors have caused the turmoil in the recent months. New tonnage capacity has arrived from shipyards even as scrapping of crude vessels have reached a low ebb, industry officials said. Crude offtake declined this month as US and Europe stepped out of winter. 

 Analysts feel that as freight rates are more than the cost of operating the vessel, the shipping companies will continue to use the old tankers. Even after the decline, the rates are profitable. However, margins are down considerably, they added. 

 ?The freight rates have continued to decrease with reduced fixture levels creating surplus tonnage followed by low scrapping and high new building deliveries,? says Rajat Dutta, general manager (planning and corporate communication) at Great Eastern Shipping. 

 The decline in the smaller tankers like Suezmax and Aframax are less than that of VLCCs, but still significant. For Suezmax, the freight rates have plunged 15.64 per cent to $25,863 per day from $30,661 in April, while in November it was as high as $113,032 per day.

 In the Aframax category, rates declined 22.78 per cent to $17,413. In November 2004, the rates were in the region of $65,219 per day. 

 ?A large number of vessels are floating around the West Asian gulf region in preparation for June loading,? Dutta added.

 Shipping companies are not too worried and say the current trends are an ?aberration?. The industry has revived through incidents and freight rates are led by events, they added.

 They feel that the first quarter of the financial year is always a lean period for the industry. US consumes less oil once spring sets in.

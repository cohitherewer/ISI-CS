Mumbai, Feb. 8: The National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom) has said that the slow growth in global spending will force infotech companies to continuously cut costs and target higher-than-average customer segments and solution areas.

 In its strategic review of the IT industry in India, the apex body, while forecasting key trends for the global IT-ITeS industry over 2005-08, said there will be moderate growth in IT expenditure as consumer spending softens.

 While this will necessitate targeting higher growth segments, Nasscom said the key sectors that are expected to drive IT spending are: infrastructure software (including security), handheld devices, network equipment and outsourcing services.

 With global corporations expected to focus on upgrading their networks and deploying new business applications, the demand for system infrastructure service providers and application service providers will witness significant growth.

 The other key trends over 2005-08 include marginal slowdown in hardware spending and a steady growth in software and services demand. While emerging economies like central and eastern Europe, China and India will drive demand, a Nasscom-IDC study found that global IT-ITeS spending is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 7.9 per cent over 2004-08.

 According to Nasscom, while Indian IT-ITeS is well positioned to continue in its leadership position in global offshore outsourcing, it needs to overcome certain challenges.

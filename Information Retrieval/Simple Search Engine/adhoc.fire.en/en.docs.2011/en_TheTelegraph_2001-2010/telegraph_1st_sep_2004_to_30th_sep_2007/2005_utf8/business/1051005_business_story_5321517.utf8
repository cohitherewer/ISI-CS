 CSE brokers plea spiked

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 4: The Securities Appellate Tribunal today dismissed the appeal filed by three Calcutta stockbrokers against the recent Sebi order banning them from the securities markets for penny stock manipulation.

 The tribunal said the appeals filed by Badri Prasad amp; Sons, Ram Mohan Sarda and Rajendra Prasad Shah are premature. The appeals are premature at this stage as the (legal) process is continuing, the SAT order said. 

 According to SAT, Sebi has not issued any final orders. The order impugned in these appeals are only an interim order. Sebi has given time to the appellants to submit their case before it within 15 days and ask for personal hearing, a two-member SAT bench said.

 This is in accordance with the process of natural justice, the bench explained. It added that the three brokers should allow the process to be completed and exhaust all remedies with Sebi before seeking redressal from the tribunal. 

 On September 29, Sebi had suspended 11 stockbrokers from the Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE), including the three who went in appeal. They will not buy, sell or deal in securities, in any manner, either directly or indirectly, till further directions, the order said. 

 The brokers debarred included Sanju Kabra, Shivam Stock Broking, D B amp; Co, M Bhiwandiwala amp; Co, A V Shares amp; Stock Brokers, Shyam Lal Sultania, Ahilya Commercial Pvt Ltd and S Jhunjhunwala amp; Co.

 They have been charged with artificially jacking up prices and creating false volumes through continuous self-deals executed on the same terminal and cross-deals among themselves.

 Such acts by brokers pose a serious risk to the stability and settlement system of the bourse, the capital market watchdog had said in its order.

 Besides, innocent investors may get attracted by the artificial trading volumes generated by these brokers and in the process be beguiled into investing in shares of fundamentally weak companies at unjustifiable market prices, only to be left adrift, it added. 

 The suspensions drove down daily volumes to Rs 59 lakh from Rs 15-18 crore.

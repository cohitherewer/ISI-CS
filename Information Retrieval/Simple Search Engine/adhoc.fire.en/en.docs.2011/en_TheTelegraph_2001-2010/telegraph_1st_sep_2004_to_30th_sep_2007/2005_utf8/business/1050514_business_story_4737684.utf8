 Posco wants Orissa to decide fast

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, May 13: Posco today urged the Orissa government to take a decision on its proposal to set up a 12-MTPA steel plant near Paradip. 

 During its final round of talks with the state government, Posco officials also brought in a new condition regarding iron ore exports. 

 We would like to come here if they (the government) accept our proposal, said the companys India director, Tae Hyun Jeong, after meeting chief minister Naveen Patnaik and a group of bureaucrats here. 

 Though the company has withdrawn its earlier demand of importing high-grade coke in lieu of iron ore from Orissa, it has put up a new one of exporting iron ore from its captive mines and import the same amount from Brazil.

 Indian ore has high alumina. It is, therefore, necessary to import from Brazil to make top-grade steel. We have the know-how for good steel production, said Jeong.

 Posco has agreed to invest in infrastructure near the plant and complete the construction in 10 years as proposed by the state government. The Korean major had earlier sought 600 million tonnes of iron ore for captive use for 30 years, besides permission to export another 400 million tonnes through its mining partner in the project, BHP Billiton of Australia.

 Jeong said BHP Billiton would not be a partner in the project as was proposed earlier. If the State government agrees to the Posco proposal, there would be no net outgo of iron ore. It would only import the same amount of iron ore that they export from their captive mines, said a senior state government official. 

 The present mineral policy of Orissa does not allow export of iron ore and instead emphasises captive use for value-addition within the state. 

 Patnaik added that negotiations are going on. I hope the matters regarding Posco are resolved very soon, he said. 

 Jeong clarified that the company proposed to export only that quantity of iron ore, which it would require to import for its plant in Orissa.

 Talks with Posco had been stuck on the contentious issue of export of iron ore. Earlier, the company wanted to export ore in lieu of high-grade ore, while the state had categorically said it will provide ore only for the plant and not for exports. Subsequent rounds of discussion involved several central ministers, the PMO as well as the Planning Commission. 

 Sources said Posco senior executives and the state government mandarins are meeting in New Delhi on next Monday to take a final decision on the integrated steel project.

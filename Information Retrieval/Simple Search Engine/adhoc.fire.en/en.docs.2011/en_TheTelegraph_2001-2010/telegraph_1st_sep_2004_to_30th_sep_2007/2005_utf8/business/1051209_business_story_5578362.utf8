 M amp;M facility in Haridwar

 GARIMA SINGH

 Mahindra: Upbeat

 Haridwar, Dec. 8: Mahindra and Mahindra (M amp;M) today kickstarted its new three-wheeler plant at the Haridwar industrial estate in Uttaranchal.

 The plant, which has seen a total investment of Rs 70 crore, plans to produce 50,000-60,000 units of the Champion range annually. The facility will initially employ approximately 100 people.

 M amp;M will, however, get the engine from its plant at Zaheerabad near Hyderabad where the Champion is being currently manufactured. The company will start making engines in Haridwar after February 2006. 

 While the automobile company has invested approximately Rs 40 crore in this facility, the balance amount has come from Neel Metal Product Limited. Neel Metal has an exclusive tie-up with M amp;M for supplying cargo bodies and other sub-assemblies.

 We plan to eventually increase production to 1 lakh units if we continue to get adequate co-operation from the state government. We will also develop a strong vendor base around the plant, M amp;M vice-chairman and managing director Anand Mahindra said while inaugurating the plant.

 The company took nine months to set up its first line of production in this 35-acre facility.

 The company sold 25,000 Champion vehicles last year.

 M amp;Ms automotive sector president Pawan Goenka said production of three-wheelers will shift to the Haridwar plant in the next one year.

 This will include 3000 units of the Champion and 1000 unit of the Alpha Champion ? both three-wheelers currently being manufactured at Zaheerabad.

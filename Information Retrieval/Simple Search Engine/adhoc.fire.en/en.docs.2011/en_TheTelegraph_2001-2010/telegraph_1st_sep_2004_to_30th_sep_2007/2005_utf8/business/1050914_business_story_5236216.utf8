The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Growth limps as birth pangs deepen for enterprises

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: It takes 71 days on an average to set up a business in India and another 270 to wangle licences.

 This makes India one of the toughest places to do business in, far more daunting than it is in Pakistan and Bangladesh, says a study by International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank?s private investment promotion arm. 

 The neighbours are ranked 60th and 65th respectively, compared with India?s own 116th, among 155 countries. The country trails all South Asian countries, except Afghanistan, when it comes to doing business. Even war-torn Iraq is better off with a rank of 114 in the study, which has been titled ?Doing Business in 2006?. 

 Not that other South Asian nations are too investor-friendly. An entrepreneur in Pakistan spends an average of 24 days in setting up a business and another 218 running around for licences. In Bangladesh, registering a business takes 363 days and costs 11 percent of the value. In Afghanistan, it could take you around 97 days and 57 signatures to import goods into Kabul.

 New Zealand, Singapore and the United States were at the top of the heap, a measure of just how simple it is for start-ups to get going. Countries with easy and straightforward business regulations create more jobs than those with high on procedures and formalities, the study says.

 The report, released today, says the largest emerging market economies ? Brazil, India and Indonesia ? have ranks below average. Brazil and Indonesia score higher than India, at rank 119 and 115 respectively. 

 The ranking is based on 10 parameters. It includes starting a business, dealing with licences, hiring and firing workers, registering property, getting property, getting credit, protecting investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and closing ventures. 

 Poor countries, particularly those in Africa, proved hardest for entrepreneurs because of cumbersome regulations and high taxes. ?Where regulations are costly and burdensome, businesses often operate in the informal economy, remain small and create few jobs,? the report said.

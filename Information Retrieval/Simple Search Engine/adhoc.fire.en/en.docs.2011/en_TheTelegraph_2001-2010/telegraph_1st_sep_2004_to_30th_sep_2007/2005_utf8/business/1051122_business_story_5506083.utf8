 Watch TV on your handset

 Sydney, Nov. 21 (PTI): Nokia, the Finnish telecom firm, is ready to bring digital convergence in telecom, IT and broadcasting through its new multimedia devices.

 While launching three handsets, Nokias senior management team said many developed countries have implemented policy allowing live television on mobile phone and hoped that India would also follow the same.

 India is one of the fastest growing nations and the largest telecom market. We are excited to offer three mini-computers for consumers pockets, said M. Montanaro, multimedia, Asia-Pacific vice-president.

 Two new devices will be available in India and other Asia-Pacific markets in the first quarter of 2006, while the third handset ? N92 ? will be available in countries where digital video broadcasting-handheld (DVB-H) will be allowed from mid-2006.

 Asked whether Indian service providers are ready to offer DVB-H to consumers, Montanaro said, We are keeping a close look at the Indian market... Offering DVB-H needs regulatory clearances.

 The Nokia N92 is the worlds first mobile device with a built-in DVB-H receiver, making it possible for users to watch and record live TV at any time. 

 Based on open standards, DVB-H is the leading mobile-TV broadcasting technology, enabling low cost delivery of high-quality broadcast programmes to mass audiences, he said.

 The other handsets, N71 and N80, are loaded with options for mobile photography, music and media.

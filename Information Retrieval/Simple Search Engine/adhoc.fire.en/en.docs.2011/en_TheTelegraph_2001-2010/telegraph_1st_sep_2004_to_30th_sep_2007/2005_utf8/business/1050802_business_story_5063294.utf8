 Hyderabad, Aug. 1: The Volkswagen project in Andhra Pradesh is still on, Frank Elbe, former German ambassador and envoy of the auto maker to India, said today after meeting chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy. 

 The project has been temporarily put on hold due to the bribery scandal involving former Volkswagen employee Helmuth Schuster. 

 But a final decision will be taken soon after the completion of the investigations into the Schuster affair in India, Elbe said. He met several state officials during the day. 

 Elbe, who arrived in Hyderabad in the early hours of Sunday, met state industry minister J. Geeta Reddy and discussed the project. 

 He said Volkswagen would compensate the damage done to Andhra Pradesh due to illegal dealings of Schuster. 

 The state had invested two million euros (Rs 11.56 crore) as part payment for a 3 per cent stake in Vashisht Wahan, a company floated by associates of Schuster in India. 

 Former Andhra industry minister B. Satyanarayana had roped in brother B. Muralikrishna as one of the ancillary dealers and real estate agents for the proposed Volkswagen site at Vishakhapatnam. Muralikrishna had links with Jagadish Alagar Raja, a director in Vashisht Wahan. 

 The state is now ready to offer an alternative site to Volkswagen in Hyderabad if the company promises to set up the plant in AP. 

 We at Volkswagen also suffered immense embarrassment and loss of image due to Schusters actions in India, he said. 

 Elbe has invited an official team from Andhra Pradesh to visit Germany soon to take the discussions on the project a step forward. 

 Earlier, Reddy thanked Volkswagen for renewing its plans to set up a car-making unit in the state. 

 Describing Elbes visit as a confidence-building mission, Reddy said, Whatever be Schusters shady deals, we should continue with the car project. 

 Elbe met senior bureaucrats, including industry commissioner Sutheertha Bhattacharya and industry secretary Lakshmi Parthsarathy.

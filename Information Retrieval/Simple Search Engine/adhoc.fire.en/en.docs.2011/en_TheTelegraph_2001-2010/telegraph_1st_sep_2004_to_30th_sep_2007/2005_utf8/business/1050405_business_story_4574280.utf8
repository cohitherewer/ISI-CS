 Black tea flavour charms China

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Cup that cheers

 Calcutta, April 4: The Chinese tea industry has initiated talks with J. Thomas amp; Co to set up an auction centre for trading the Indian variety of the beverage in China.

 A four-member team from the Chinese tea industry today met the chairman and board of directors of J. Thomas to discuss its proposed auction centre.

 The team also met Tea Board chairman N.K. Das to discuss the import of black tea from India. It invited Indian tea companies to participate in the China Tea Expo 2005, which will be held during October 9-12. Seven Indian firms had participated in the China Tea Expo 2004.

 After an hour-long meeting with the Tea Board chairman, China Tea Company chairman Zhu Futang said, ?Initially, we will not lift large quantities of Indian tea. We want the tea companies to come to China and start trading in a big way. We also want Chinese companies to come to India and sell green tea. We are talking to J. Thomas for better understanding of the Indian auction system.?

 Though China, the birthplace of tea, also produced black tea, its quality did not match that made in India and Sri Lanka. However, China is well known for its green tea. India exported just 62,813 kg of tea to China in 2004, garnering a 2.67 per cent market share, while Sri Lanka shipped 5,73,244 kg, which accounted for 24.33 per cent.

 Kenya has garnered a 31.20 per cent market share by exporting 7,35,285 kg of tea.

 Justin Wu, deputy secretary-general, and Wendy Sun, secretary-general, China Tea Expo, said more and more young Chinese people like the black tea. ?This has prompted us to lift more black tea to meet the growing consumption,? they added.

 They said Tata Tea is keen to set up an instant tea plant in China.

 A major problem with Indian tea is its high price. Sri Lankan tea comes for $2.90 per kg whereas the Indian variety costs $4.42 per kg. Kenyan tea is even cheaper at $1.77 per kg.

 ?We are willing to help Indian tea companies correct this anomaly. We do not see any problem in marketing Indian tea in China. China is a big market and Indian tea will get buyers,? added Zhu.

 The Chinese tea trade also plans to join hands with other tea producing nations to develop a manifesto to promote tea as a health drink worldwide.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Beeyu cool to takeover threat

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Calcutta, Sept. 10: Beeyu Overseas Ltd, the Rs 36-crore tea, coffee and machinery exporter, could face a hostile takeover bid from city-based investor S. K. Khetan who is mulling the option of making an open offer for a 33 per cent stake. He already holds 3 per cent of the stock.

 I am seriously considering the move though a final decision has not yet been taken, Khetan told The Telegraph. 

 I am in touch with other large investors who collectively hold another 15 per cent stake in the company and have promised to support me if I make the move, he added.

 Khetan claims that an additional 33 per cent stake would bring him on a par with the current promoters, B. P. Singh and his associates, who hold approximately 35 per cent shares of the company. And along with the 15 per cent support of the other large investors, he would be in control of 51 per cent of the outstanding stake.

 Khetan says he is attracted by the value proposition that Beeyu offers. 

 The current enterprise value of the company is approximately Rs 60 crore against which the market capital is only Rs 35 crore, thereby making it an extremely attractive investment proposition, he said.

 Beeyu chairman B. P. Singh, who claims to hold a 55 per cent stake along with associates, rubbished the threat from Khetan. 

 The 17,000 investors across the country hold another 35 per cent, with 15,000 of them holding less than 500 shares, said Singh.

 Therefore, the persons making such claims cannot get hold of more than 10 per cent. So, I am not concerned about any corporate raider who has dreams of taking over our company.

 The company has been paying dividends for the last 12 years despite the tough times faced by the tea industry and we are confident that the investors will continue to support us, added Singh.

 We are also opposed to the resolution of delisting the companys shares from the Calcutta Stock Exchange to be tabled at the forthcoming annual general meeting of the company on September 19, Khetan mentioned. 

 Until a few months ago, the scrip was listed only on the Calcutta Stock Exchange, Khetan said. It was then listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange. 

 Khetan said he would attempt to stall efforts to delist the stock from CSE as it was not in the interest of the shareholders. 

 F.J. Kapadia, director (finance) of the company, said Beeyu Overseas was in an expansion mode. 

 We have entered into a joint venture to set up the countrys first fridge dried coffee plant, he said. 

 He refused to disclose the identity of the joint venture partner, but market sources said the the agreement had been signed with Tata Coffee.

 Also, we have bid to acquire plantations and tea production facilities in Sri Lanka. In addition, we are conducting due diligence to acquire tea factories in the Dooars, Kapadia added.

 Beeyu Overseas Limited had recently made a second public issue of 70 lakh shares of Rs 10 each at a premium of Rs 4 per share. Its current equity base is Rs 14 crore. On Friday, the stock closed at Rs 24.75.

 Chambers? red signal for cross-subsidisation

 OUR BUREAU

Feb. 26: Calling the railway budget 2005-06 quot;populist quot;, Indian industry today urged the government to stop the cross subsidisation of freight rates. 

 Onkar S. Kanwar, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), said, ?By leaving passenger fares untouched, the railway minister has chosen to persist with cross-subsidisation of freight rates.?

 Industry associations have argued for long to end the regime of cross-subsidisation to free resources for developmental projects.

 On the other hand, India Inc lauded the move to allow private organisations to run container trains hoping the proposal to run such trains would get the same facilities and treatment as those accorded to Concor.

 Sunil Kant Munjal, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said, ?We welcome the end of the monopoly of Concor on container movement.? 

 Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry president S. S. Nundy also appreciated the move to end monopoly.

 Container movement has been growing at a rapid pace, as high as 17 per cent annually. According to the industry, Concor was alone unable to satisfy the growing demands.

 The introduction of double-decker racks to move containers across the country would also give respite to the industry.

 Improvement in railway efficiency through better utilisation of existing rolling stock, user-friendly freight operating system and reforms in the railway accounting system are all conceived as a pre-requisite to commercialisation of the railways.

 The wagon investment scheme, which would give dedicated rail users some certainty regarding the availability of wagons, has been well acknowledged by the industry.

 The CII also welcomed the proposed rationalisation in the goods tariff from 4000 commodity groups to 80. However, the CII feels ?a lot needs to be done for gaining efficiency?.

 Munjal said the budget did not make any attempt to correct the cross subsidies, which is essential to put the railways finance back on track.

 ?The country has the highest freight rates in the world that needs to be brought down to make India Inc competitive. The budget should have made some attempt to correct this anomaly,? he added.

 Welcoming the proposal of setting up the Rail Land Development Authority (RLDA), which would promote public private partnership, India Inc said this would help railways generate revenue from non-traditional areas.

 Nundy hailed the agreement with Central Warehouse Corporation to set up 22 godowns adjacent to railway stations. He, however, expressed disappointment for small allocation in railway safety and security measures.

 Anup Singh, president, Indian Chamber of Commerce, Calcutta, complimented railway minister Laloo Prasad Yadav for a growth-oriented budget, which proposes an outlay of Rs 15,300 crore for modernisation and expansion of the rail network without an increase in the goods freight and passenger fares.

 ?The railways is recovering lost market share of freight traffic and the fact that it has not increased freight rates will be a help in this direction,? Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman said.

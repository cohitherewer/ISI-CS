 NTPC alerted on fresh borrowings

 M. RAJENDRAN AND JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, March 27: The Committee of Secretaries has advised National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) against seeking fresh loans from State Bank of India for its 360-MW Kayamkulam power project.

 The Rs 6,595.36-crore gas-based project, commissioned in 1999, provides power to Kerala and Tamil Nadu. 

 The debt-equity ratio for the project is 70:30. The equity has been raised from internal resources, while the debt has come through a mix of external commercial borrowings (ECB) and domestic loans.

 ?One of the loans for the Kayamkulam project is from State Bank of India. When contracted in 1998-99, it carried a floating interest rate of 12 per cent and was attractive then,? a note prepared by the committee said.

 In the tariff petition submitted by NTPC for 2004-09 for the project, the rate of interest from SBI was 10.08 per cent as on April 1, 2004, (including the financing charges). The overall weighted average rate of interest in 2004-05 for loans is 6.49 per cent, the note added.

 The committee has pointed out that if NTPC?s proposal to refinance is approved, it would not be viable for the public sector power major. 

 Even if this loan is refinanced, fresh funds may not be available below the weighted average rate of 6.75 per cent per annum. 

 Considering prepayment charges of 0.5 per cent and other fresh charges like financing, processing and guarantee fees of 0.5-1 per cent, there are chances that NTPC may pay higher interest. It will also have to reckon with a three-year moratorium period on the refinanced loan. ?NTPC would pay Rs 250 crore more in interest. Therefore, refinancing of this loan might not be beneficial,? the note said.

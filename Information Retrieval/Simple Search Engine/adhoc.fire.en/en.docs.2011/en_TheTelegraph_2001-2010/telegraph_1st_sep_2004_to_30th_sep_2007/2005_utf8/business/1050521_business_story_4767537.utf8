 Calcutta, May 20: State Bank of India (SBI) is eager to take control of UTI Asset Management Company (AMC), which will be put on the block by the government.

 We are keen to take over UTI AMC provided we get it at the right price, SBI chairman A. K. Purwar said. Though he refused to elaborate on what the right price would be, market sources peg the amount at Rs 1,000 crore.

 SBI officials said going by the industry benchmark of a realisation value of close to 4 per cent of the assets under management, the figure could range between Rs 800 crore and Rs 1,200 crore.

 The government has decided to invite bids for the assets of UTI Mutual Fund (MF) from the four sponsors of its AMC. They are SBI, Life Insurance Corporation, Punjab National Bank (PNB) and Bank of Baroda (BoB).

 The second valuation report of the mutual funds assets is being drawn up and SBI, with its financial muscle and interests in the fund management business, is seen as the likely buyer.

 Of the other three sponsors, PNB and BoB might find it tough to cough up the required amount, though they have their own AMCs. 

 The government wants to cash in on the goodwill of the UTI brand and expects to net a substantial amount. UTI MF has several schemes and a vast network through which it manages and markets offshore funds.

 The valuation of the AMC will have to factor in the UTI brand, besides the assets ? which are almost equally split between debt and equity. 

 Unlike acquisitions where assets are taken over, the entity taking over UTI AMC will alsoget subsidiaries like UTI Ventures and UTI International, an overseas fund administrator.

 The tricky issue could be blending the two big brands ? UTI and SBI.

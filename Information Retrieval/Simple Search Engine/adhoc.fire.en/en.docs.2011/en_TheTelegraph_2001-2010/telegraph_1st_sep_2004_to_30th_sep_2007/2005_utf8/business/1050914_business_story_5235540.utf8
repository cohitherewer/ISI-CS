 Power traders in for a shock

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Basu: Tough stand

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: Power trading companies could take a major hit in revenues if the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) implements its proposal to bring down trading margins to as low as 2 paise from the prevailing 35-37 paise per unit.

 The power traders, led by Power Trading Corporation (PTC), have resented the move. The commission has given licences to 14 power traders.

 A senior CERC member said, The power traders were monitored for the last few months. We found that they enter into agreements with power generators and transmission and distribution companies and hoard them. This is not good for the sector as it leads to a hike in tariff for end customers.

 Trading companies are charging very high margins, as a result of which consumers are suffering. They dont do any value addition...just buy and sell power. Why should they charge such high margins? CERC chairman A.K. Basu said.

 Basu said as of now no limit has been fixed for margins and in some cases the trading companies were charging as high as 35-37 paise per unit.

 It should not be for profit, it should be sufficient for maintenance and operational functions, he said, adding the margins could be hiked to 2.5 paise but would not be so high.

 CERC today released a draft, seeking comments from the stakeholders to fix trade margins. The power regulator has proposed that a trading licensee cannot charge a margin exceeding 2 paise per kilowatt hour (kwh) on the electricity traded. 

 The margin will include all charges, except the charges for scheduled energy and open access. The charges for open access include the transmitting and operating charges and an application fee. The regulator will receive comments on the issue till this month end.

 While senior CERC officials were confident that the lowering of margin would not hit the financial position of the power traders, the companies were peeved that the move could impact power trading in the country.

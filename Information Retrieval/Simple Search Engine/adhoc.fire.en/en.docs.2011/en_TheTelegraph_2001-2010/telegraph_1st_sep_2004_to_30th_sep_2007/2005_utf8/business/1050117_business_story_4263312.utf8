 Over to Frankfurt for VW project in Vizag

 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Gearing up

 Hyderabad, Jan. 16: Volkswagen?s plan to set up a Rs 5500-crore car manufacturing plant in Vishakhapatnam will be cleared by the Andhra Pradesh government on Monday.

 The move follows a letter from the head of Volkswagen?s India operations, Helmuth Shuster, to the state authorities, saying he was confident of the project?s viability after the Andhra government agreed to pick up a sliver of equity in the venture. It is over now to the global auto major?s January 17 meeting in Frankfurt, where the plan to set up base in Vizag will be approved.

 Shuster said he had some minor worries over the tsunami impact on the project site but these were removed after state industry minister B. Satyanarayana submitted a report on the issue to a VW team. ?The Volkswagen officials are satisfied,? he added. 

 Volkswagen?s plant will initially assemble cars from completely knocked-down (CKD) kits. ?The company also has proposals to make heavy vehicles and premium cars that will be exported to the Asia-Pacific region. It will promote 25 ancillary industries in the port town, both for its own use and to feed the market,? he added.

 In the first phase, Volkswagen is expected to invest Rs 1500 crore in the plant, for which the government has allocated 250 acres. ?We are also offering subsidised water and power for three years, besides a tax-holiday for a similar period,? state industry secretary K. V. Rao said.

 The government, he said, has asked AP Industrial Infrastructure Corporation to pick up a nominal amount of equity in the car project, in exchange for the land.

 Ashok Jain, the Indian consultant for Europe?s largest car maker, is camping in Hyderabad to help give finishing touches to the pact that will be signed by both sides. ?Senior Volkswagen officials will be in the Andhra capital soon to sign the agreement and attend a ground-breaking ceremony kicking off the project,? Rao said.

 The Volkswagen project will be a shot in the arm for the seven-month-old Y. S. Rajasekhar Reddy regime. ?The TDP government had failed to grab the Ford offer to set up a plant in the state. The company lost the venture to neighbouring Tamil Nadu,? a senior official said.

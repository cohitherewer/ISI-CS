 New Delhi, Dec. 23: The Left allies at the Centre today asked the government to exercise caution in discussing issues concerning developing countries, particularly when the final modalities are worked out at the World Trade Organisation.

 The Left wants India to exercise some caution. We have taken their inputs ... they are useful and we will keep them in mind, said Union commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath while speaking about his meeting with the Left parties this morning. He was speaking on the sidelines of the 78th annual general meeting of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 Nath said CPIs D. Raja had appreciated the leadership role played by India among the developing countries and the least developed countries.

 However, the CPI(M) politbureau had earlier said in a statement, The role of the Government of India in WTO negotiations have not produced an outcome that adequately protect the interests of the farmers and the country.

 But Nath said the contours laid down at the Hong Kong conference would take care of Indias concerns in agriculture and industry and described the WTO ministerial as reasonable success. 

 According to him, India has made it adequately clear that it wants tariff peaks and escalations in developed countries to be addressed first before any market access in India.

 Nath, however, pointed out that Indias tariffs were coming down to Asean levels. He said the government ensured at the WTO negotiations that the tariff reduction formula addressed the problems of tariff peaks and escalations under which developed world puts more duty on valued-added products.

 Import tariffs for India were not a revenue source but its position at the meet took into account the concerns of its fellow developing and the least developed countries, Nath added.

 Global economy cannot be healthy if the economies of developing countries were not healthy, he said.

 The reasonable success at the Hong Kong ministerial had made it clear that India can play a constructive role in establishing equity in global trade and help the multilateral system move forward.

 We have established that India can play a constructive role to make a move forward towards greater equity. The inequities in global trade cannot be perpetuated further, Nath said.

 Meanwhile, the government today said the rules for special economic zones would be notified by this year-end.

 We will notify rules in the next four-five days ... before the year end, the minister said.

 While Parliament passed the SEZ bill in June, the rules were yet to be notified. 

 The government is expecting these export zones to generate investment to the tune of Rs 50,000 crore and create huge employment opportunities.

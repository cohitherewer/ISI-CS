This followed MSCIs annual review and the changes will be effective at the close of business on May 31.

 MSCI has made some changes in its Standard Index series. It has added 113 Asia-Pacific stocks to the world series. It has raised the limited investability factor for its Taiwan Index to one from 0.75, which is expected to result in international funds increasing their weightage for stocks from that country. 

 The inclusion saw some of these shares attracting investor interest on the bourses today. Capital market sources said this was because of the feeling that foreign fund managers would increase their holdings in these shares.

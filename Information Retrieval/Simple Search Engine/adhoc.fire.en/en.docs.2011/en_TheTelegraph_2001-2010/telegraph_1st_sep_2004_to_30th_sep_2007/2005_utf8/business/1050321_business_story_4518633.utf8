 Withdrawal tax in black and white

 SATISH JOHN

 Mumbai, March 20: P. Chidambaram may or may not be right in saying the ten-rupee tax on each cash withdrawal of above Rs 10,000 from banks is not a revenue-raising step, but it is difficult to question his claim about its utility in establishing a money trail.

 Even as the finance minister promised last week in Parliament to revisit the proposal, banking experts agreed that the tax would have a restraining effect on black money transactions.

 A rough calculation shows that in a year the revenue from the tax will be over Rs 100 crore, though the budget papers have not provided an estimate.

 Cherian Verghese, chairman of Union Bank of India, said official figures on the number of customers withdrawing above Rs 10,000 are not available. But based on his experience, he estimated an average 10-15 cash transactions above Rs 10,000 in most urban branches.

 India has around 66,000 bank branches and 35 per cent of these are in urban areas.

 Assuming a six-day banking week and that each of the 15 taxable withdrawals from each urban branch is Rs 10,000, the revenue in a full year will be Rs 108 crore. This is obviously a conservative estimate and the actual revenue should be higher. 

 Some private bank officials said 30-50 per cent of all cash transactions would be upwards of Rs 10,000.

 Subir Gokarn, chief economist at leading credit rating agency Crisil, differed with those of the tax?s critics who rubbish its very rationale.

 Gurudas Dasgupta, the CPI leader active in banking unions, had wondered why black money would go into a bank account. This is almost a universal question. 

 Dasgupta?s political enemy Anand Pandit, a BJP leader and a shareholder-director in the Bank of Maharashtra, which is government-owned, asked: ?Which fool will put his black money in a bank account??

 Many do, and they are not ?fools?. ?Money is fungible ? it can move back and forth from white to black,? said Gokarn.

 An income-tax official said much of the black money transactions at one point emerge from the banking system. ?When black money flows from city to city, it has to use the banking system. Black marketers cannot carry huge amounts of money in suitcases and gunny bags (as most of us think),? he said.

 Gokarn said the new tax could get the honest taxpayer to insist that he pay by cheque for the goods and services he buys.

 For instance, when a salaried person buys a house or renovates one, he has to pay the builder or contractor in cash. If the tax sees the light of day, it will become a powerful disincentive to paying in cash in real estate deals where use of black money is believed to be rampant. 

 ?It will create a constraint on the supply side,? Gokarn added. 

 It is estimated that Rs 40 out of every Rs 100 spent in India is black money.

 Some bankers are sceptical if the purpose of the tax will be served. A lot of data will come up, but they question if tax authorities will be able to unravel it.

 The income-tax official said banks were asked to report cash transactions of Rs 50,000 by giving the IT department these customers? permanent account numbers. Reams of paper were generated but the data was not online.

 With the Rs 10 tax, banks will pass on the identity of the customer to the I-T authorities, which could then run random checks.

 Australia has a similar levy and it?s called BAD (bank account debits) ? not because it?s a ?bad? tax. It is planning to scrap it, though.

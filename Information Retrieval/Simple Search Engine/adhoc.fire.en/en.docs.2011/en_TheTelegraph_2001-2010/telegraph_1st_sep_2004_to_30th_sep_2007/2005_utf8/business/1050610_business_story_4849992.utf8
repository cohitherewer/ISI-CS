 Go-ahead for power plans

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 9: The Public Investment Board today approved three power projects worth Rs 5,055.13 crore. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will lay the foundation stones for two of these projects in Leh and Kargil on Saturday.

 The board has also approved a transmission project to evacuate power from the coal-based power plant to be built by National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) at Barh in Bihar. 

 Union power minister P. M. Sayeed said two hydro-electric projects ? Nimoo Bazgo and Chutak ? will be set up in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir by National Hydro-electric Power Corporation.

 Sayeed allayed fears of an impending power crisis in the country because of coal shortage in six thermal units in the country.

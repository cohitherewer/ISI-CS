 Accounting errors mar AIG results 

 New York, Nov. 9 (Reuters): American International Group Inc. said on Wednesday it would delay filing its third-quarter results until November 14, giving it time to correct errors. The company is addressing its previous accounting weaknesses.

 The worlds largest insurer by market value has already been the subject of state and federal investigations into its accounting practices after errors were discovered this year.

 AIG warned investors not to rely on its prior financial statements. It did, however, estimate it made a net profit in the third quarter of $1.7 billion despite big losses from the hurricanes in the Mexican Gulf.

 The company said errors identified in the third quarter this year resulted in an understatement of $500 million of previously reported consolidated retained earnings as on June 30. The effect on prior-period profits may be positive or negative and the amount will vary from quarter to quarter, AIG said.

 It said it would restate its financial previous results since 2002, mainly related to derivatives and hedges. AIG said it believed its hedging activities were effective, but that they did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

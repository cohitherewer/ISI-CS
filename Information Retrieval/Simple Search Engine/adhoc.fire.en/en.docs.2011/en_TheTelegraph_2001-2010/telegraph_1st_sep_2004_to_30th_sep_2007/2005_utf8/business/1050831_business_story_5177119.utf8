 Panel set up to reopen talks with Airbus 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Long wait

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: The Prime Minister today set up an empowered group of ministers to negotiate prices with Airbus Industrie. The planes will be bought by Indian Airlines. The panel will be headed by finance minister P. Chidambaram and other members include civil aviation minister Praful Patel, law minister H.R. Bharadwaj and Oscar Fernandes, minister of state for statistics and programme implementation.

 Earlier this month, the cabinet committee on economic affairs had decided to set up the empowered group after MPs wrote to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh alleging that Indian Airlines had paid a higher price for 43 aircraft it bought compared with what its rivals had paid for similar carriers. 

 A similar accusation has also been levelled by MPs against Boeing aircraft being bought by Air-India. 

 The state-run carrier plans to buy a fleet of 19 A-319s, four A-320s and 20 A-321 planes.

 About 70 per cent of the aircraft are replacement buys, while the rest will augment IAs fleet. 

 Indian Airlines will phase out 11 Boeing 737s that make up the Alliance Air fleet, 15 A-320s, which are on lease, and three A-300s.

 The government today circulated a transaction document for the restructuring and modernisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports to eight shortlisted bidders.

 The document makes it mandatory for the winner to carry out major works like building a second runway at the Delhi airport within the next two years.

 The bidders will have to spend Rs 2,800 crore on Delhi airport and Rs 2,600 crore on Mumbai over the next five years. The eight bidders would have to submit their technical and financial bids within two weeks, or September 14.

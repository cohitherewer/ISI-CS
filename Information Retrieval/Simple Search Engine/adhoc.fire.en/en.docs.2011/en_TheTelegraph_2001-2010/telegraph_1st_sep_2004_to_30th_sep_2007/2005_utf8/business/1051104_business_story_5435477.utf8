 Trai seeks to bring broadband closer home

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: The telecom regulator has urged the government to unbundle the last-mile connectivity to allow small players like cable operators to provide broadband services.

 With the government all set to miss its own target of three million broadband users by December 2005, the telecom watchdog has also asked it to offer financial incentives in the form of tax holidays for broadband services and special packages for broadband equipment manufacturers. 

 Till September this year, the total broadband subscribers reported by all operators was only 0.61 million.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today reiterated that the implementation of its recommendations pertaining to local loop unbundling and fiscal incentives is essential for growth of broadband.

 In a letter to the secretary in the department of telecommunications, Trai has recommended a review of the provisions of the broadband policy and reconsideration of Trais recommendations pertaining to local loop unbundling and fiscal incentives for broadband.

 The government had earlier set a target of 3 million broadband users, of which 50 per cent was to be achieved by Bharat Sanchar Nigam and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam.

 However, a progress report submitted by various service providers shows the subscriber base has increased to 0.61 million till September.

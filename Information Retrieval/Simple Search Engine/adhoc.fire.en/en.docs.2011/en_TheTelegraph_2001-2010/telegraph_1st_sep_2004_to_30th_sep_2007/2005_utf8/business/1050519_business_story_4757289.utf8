 Bank of Rajasthan to raise Rs 1000 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Tayal: Big plans

 Mumbai, May 18: Bank of Rajasthan (BoR) plans to raise up to Rs 1000 crore through American depository receipts (ADRs), global depository receipts (GDRs) or a domestic public issue.

 This was decided by the board on May 11. The bank today informed the bourses that it would seek shareholder approval through a resolution under section 81(A) in its forthcoming annual general meeting on June 17. 

 This is for issuing offering and allotting shares with or without warrants for an aggregate amount not exceeding Rs 1000 crore or equivalent thereof in any foreign currency to residents or non-residents by way of ADRs, GDRs, convertible debentures or public, rights and preferential issues.

 Chairman P. K. Tayal told The Telegraph that while the proposal to raise an amount of up to Rs 1000 crore is only an enabling resolution, the quantum or the nature of the instrument will be decided by the board.

 The exact amount will be decided by the board after the shareholders give their approval, he said. 

 Tayal added that the proceeds would finance the banks expansion plans. Of late, a number of nationalised banks have tapped the capital markets to increase their capital base and meet the requirements of the Basel II norms.

 The bank has suffered a net loss of Rs 12.09 crore for the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2005 compared with a loss of Rs 22.13 crore in the corresponding period last year because of additional provisioning.

 In the current fiscal, the bank plans to balance its treasury exposure by focusing on increased credit lending in the corporate and retail segments. 

 Its lending rose to Rs 2983.10 crore for 2004-05 from Rs 2498.37 crore last fiscal.

 BoR will move resolutions to increase its authorised capital to Rs 250 crore from Rs 150 crore.

 Calcutta, Aug. 9: Parle Bisleri plans to foray into the fruit juice market.

 The packaged drinking water maker will invest Rs 100 crore over the next three years to upgrade its plant at Chittor, Andhra Pradesh, and to set up a new facility in the north or east. Parle Bisleri has already invested Rs 50 crore in the Chittor plant

 We would launch the fruit juices within a year under the brand Alfa, said chairman and managing director Ramesh Chauhan.

 The company produces Rs 100 crore worth of fruit concentrate at its Chittor plant and, therefore, the basic infrastructure in already in place, said Chauhan.

 We sell 50 per cent of the concentrate to Coca-Cola and export the remaining fruit pulp under the Maaza brand, he said. 

 We will launch five or six flavours under the Alfa brand and have already started test marketing for mango juice in Tamil Nadu, said Chauhan.

 The company has also chalked out an expansion plan for its packaged drinking water. It has appointed city-based Orient Beverages as sole franchisee in the east and has plans to double sales in the region over the next one year.

 The company has two manufacturing units in Calcutta and Cuttack, which caters to Bengal, Jharkhand and Orissa.

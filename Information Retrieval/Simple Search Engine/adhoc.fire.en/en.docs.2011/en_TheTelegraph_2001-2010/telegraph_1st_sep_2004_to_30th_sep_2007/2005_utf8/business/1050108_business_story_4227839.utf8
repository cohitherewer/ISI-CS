 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: The government today said it is confident of achieving the Reserve Bank of India?s projection of 6-6.5 per cent GDP growth for fiscal 2004-05.

 On the sidelines of a conference on pensions, chief economic adviser Ashok Lahiri said, ?Due to a somewhat disappointing kharif crop output, the RBI has pegged the GDP growth at 6-6.5 per cent. I think let us keep it that way for the time being.?

 Few days ago, Michael Carter, country director of the World Bank, had also said the bank feels that India will be able to attain a 6-6.5 per cent GDP growth in this financial year.

 Lahiri said a series of fiscal and monetary measures taken by the finance ministry and the Reserve Bank has helped check inflation, which had touched 8.33 per cent in August.

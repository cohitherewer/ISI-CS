 Dabur pops 1:1 bonus

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Good going

 New Delhi, Oct. 24: Dabur India Ltd, the FMCG and personal care products firm, today announced a 1:1 bonus and proposed an increase in authorised share capital from Rs 50 crore to Rs 125 crore. 

 The board, which met here today to take stock of second-quarter results, recommended an interim dividend of 150 per cent.

 It suggested amendments to the clauses of the memorandum and articles of association of the company to facilitate the increase in authorised share capital.

 The board feels the current capital base is not commensurate with its size and the future potential of business. Also, the bonus issue was long overdue, company chairman V.C. Burman said.

 The authorised share capital must go up because the paid-up capital will increase as a result of the bonus shares. The funds will also be used to meet its future requirements.

 We will seek shareholders approval for these through a postal ballot by January, said P.D. Narang, group director of Dabur.

 On September 30, Dabur had a paid-up capital of Rs 28.66 crore, which will rise to Rs 57.3 crore after the bonus issue. The board has fixed October 31 as the record date for payment of dividend, which will cost the firm Rs 42.99 crore.

 Net rises 53% 

 The company has posted a 53 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 99.28 crore for the first half of this fiscal ended September 30 compared with Rs 64.89 crore in the same period last year. Revenues went up 23.32 per cent to Rs 882.24 crore from Rs 715.39 crore a year ago. These are consolidated figures of Dabur India, Dabur International, Dabur Foods and their respective subsidiaries.

 Our key growth drivers have recorded a remarkable rise in the first six months. Balsara businesses became profitable and recorded a turnaround with a Rs 7.3-crore profit. Our foods and international businesses posted a sales growth of 48.3 per cent and 20.1 per cent, respectively. Healthcare gained momentum and recorded a 32.3 per cent rise during the period, said CEO Sunil Duggal.

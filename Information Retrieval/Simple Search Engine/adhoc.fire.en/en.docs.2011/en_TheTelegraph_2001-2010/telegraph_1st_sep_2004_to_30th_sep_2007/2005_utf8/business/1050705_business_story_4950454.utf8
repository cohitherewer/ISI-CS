 Calcutta, July 4: Dubai-based cable company Ducab is planning to set up a manufacturing base in India to cater to the burgeoning domestic market.

 However, the company is eyeing institutional customers with large infrastructure projects like metro rail, airport upgradation and power generation, transmission and distribution, instead of the retail segment.

 With the Indian market expected to grow at a high rate, we would like to set up a manufacturing base here itself, Jon Vail, general manager (technical) of Ducab said.

 The company has already supplied cables to the Delhi Metro Railway Corporation (DMRC) and the proposed metro rail project in Bangalore could open up a potential business for the company.

 Ducab is also wooing private sector companies like CESC Ltd. A team from the local power utility will visit Ducabs Jabel Ali facility next week.

 Besides, a number of new power generation units will come up in the next few years. Each megawatt of power generation requires 5-6 km of cable. Our pie in the whole segment will also be significant, Vail added.

 Airport modernisation programme chalked out by the Union civil aviation ministry will also create demand for high performance cables.

 The increased focus of the government on infrastructure development and increasing awareness among people about using good quality electric copper cable make us confident about the Indian market, Vail clarified.

 Ducab procures a large quantity of copper, the basic raw material, from Hindalco and Sterlite in India for its manufacturing facilities in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, which together have a copper processing capacity of 65,000 tonnes per annum. 

 Ducab sales manager Pijush Bhattacharjee said the company would only focus on the niche segment of specialised cable market. 

 The company was founded in 1979 as a 40:60 joint venture between the world leader, BICC Plc, and the Dubai government. 

 In 2001, BICC exited from the venture and the government of Dubai and Abu Dhabi became equal partners in the company.

 Customs duty on imported cable now stands at 15 per cent. However, infrastructure and mega power projects (having capacity above 500 megawatt) can import cable duty-free.

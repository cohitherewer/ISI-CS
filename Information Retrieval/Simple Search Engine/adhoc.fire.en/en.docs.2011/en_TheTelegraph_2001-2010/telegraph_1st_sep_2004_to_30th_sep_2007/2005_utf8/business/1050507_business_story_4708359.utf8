 Fresh chapter in debt rejig

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Welcome Change 

 Mumbai, May 6: In an attempt to expand the scope of companies needing corporate debt restructuring (CDR), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today placed in the public domain its proposed amendments to the guidelines on the issue.

 The amendments are based on the recommendations made by a special group under the chairmanship of S. Gopinath, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank. 

 The major modifications proposed in the existing CDR scheme deal with extending the arrangement to corporate entities to which banks and financial institutions have an outstanding exposure of Rs 10 crore or more. 

 However, any corporate debt restructuring plan would require the support of 60 per cent of the creditors by number, in addition to the approval of 75 per cent of the creditors by value to make the decision making process more equitable, the RBI said.

 The new guidelines seek to link the restoration of asset classification on the date of reference to CDR Cell and to implementation of package within three months from the date of approval. Thus it would restrict the regulatory concession in asset classification and provisioning requirement to the first restructuring. 

 The other changes proposed to the CDR scheme relate to convergence in the methodology for computation of economic sacrifice among banks and financial institutions, regulatory treatment of non-SLR instruments acquired while funding interest or in lieu of outstanding principal and valuation of such instruments. 

 The RBI has also proposed guidelines that will enhance balance sheet disclosures, pro-rata sharing of additional finance requirement, including one time settlement (OTS) as a part of the CDR scheme and discretion to the core group in dealing with wilful defaulters in certain cases.

 The apex bank has also sought to limit its role to providing broad guidelines for the CDR system only. 

 It has asked for the feedback of the public. Comments on the proposed amendments may be sent within a period of one month.

 Panel wins better deal from Airbus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The empowered group of ministers set up to renegotiate aircraft prices with Airbus Industrie today secured a better quotation from the aircraft-maker as well as from engine-maker CFM, who will supply engines to the carriers. 

 However, officials were tight-lipped on the exact nature of the better deal. Earlier, Indian Airlines had agreed to pay over $2 billion for a mix of 43 Airbus planes. The panel will again meet tomorrow to discuss and come out with a conclusive deal. 

 After a 4-hour meeting, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said, All negotiations have been concluded. Definitely, we have looked at bettering the deal. The final decision will be taken tomorrow.

 Our internal deliberations are yet to take place. However, there will be no further talks with the aircraft maker, he added.

 Patel refused to quantify the discount offered by Airbus and CFM, but asserted that it would be a good bargain.

 The group was set up after MPs wrote to the Prime Minister that Indian Airlines and Air-India are paying a higher price for planes, which their rivals are buying for a lesser amount.

 Official sources had indicated that the government could leverage big-ticket defence purchases to force Airbus Industrie for a discount or better terms.

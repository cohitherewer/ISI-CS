 Tata Tea chief ahead in ITA race 

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Siganporia: New task

 Calcutta, Sept. 4: Percy T. Siganporia, managing director of Tata Tea, is tipped to become the next chairman of the Indian Tea Association (ITA).

 Siganporia and K.S. David, managing director of the Goodricke group, are currently the vice-chairmen of the apex body of domestic tea producers.

 Industry sources said at a meeting of the past five ITA chairmen it has been decided that Siganporia should be at the helm of the association. 

 The post of the vice-chairman, which will fall vacant following Siganporias new responsibility, will be filled in by Aditya Khaitan, managing director of McLeod Russel.

 Siganporia will succeed C.K. Dhanuka, who had taken over the chairmanship of the association two years ago.

 The industry spoke highly about Siganporia. He has spent more than 30 years with Tata Tea and has immense knowledge not only about the domestic tea market but also about the global scenario. He is a perfect gentleman, said an industry veteran.

 Davids name has been dropped because the past five chairmen were not unanimous about him becoming the chairman of ITA, sources added. They preferred Siganporia. They were unanimous on Khaitan for the post of vice-chairman, sources said.

 Traditionally, the ITA convenes a meeting of the past chairmen where it is decided which of the vice-chairmen will become the next chairman. 

 Efforts were made to get in touch with Dhanuka, but he was not available.

 Certain issues pertaining to David have cropped up, which are expected to be sorted out at the committee meeting of the ITA on September 14.

 The annual general meeting of the ITA will be held on September 16. The name of Siganporia for the post of the chairman will be recommended to the 20-member committee on September 17. This will be the first meeting of the new committee.

 The industry feels that Siganporia is a perfect marketing man and the association needs a person who can promote Indian tea internationally in an effective way.

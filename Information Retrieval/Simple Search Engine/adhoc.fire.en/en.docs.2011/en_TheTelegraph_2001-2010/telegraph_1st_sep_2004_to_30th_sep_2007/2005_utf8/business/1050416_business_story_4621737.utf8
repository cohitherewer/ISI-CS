 Bharti to take a call on new ventures

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mittal: Bigger horizon

 Guwahati, April 15: The Bharti group plans to enter new areas like retailing, railways, agro-processing and civil aviation. It will soon undertake a process to streamline its human resource in telecom operations with a focus on decentralisation in decision making.

 The move will also coincide with the dilution of stake by Bharti chief Sunil Mittal to raise resources for the new ventures.

 Sources said the company is likely to join hands with UK-based retail major Tesco to start the new venture once the government allows FDI in retailing.

 Mittal said: ?Our stake will be diluted in Bharti Tele-Ventures when we feel the need to raise resources for new ventures like airports. These will need an initial investment of more than Rs 5,000 crore.?

 The group hopes to win the bid for Delhi airport and is not keen on Mumbai airport. Mittal is clear that he will not bid for the smaller airports if he loses the bid for the Delhi airport. 

 However, he plans to go for all the small airports if he wins the Delhi bid.

 ?We will not settle for anything less than Delhi. I have told my team to go for nothing less, not even Mumbai. Delhi will give us the experience to take new projects, quot; said Mittal.

 The telecom major, the first private mobile and fixed-line service provider in India, is bullish about the future of new businesses the group wants to enter into.

 ?The railways, agro-processing, aviation and retail are new businesses that we will examine as part of the new areas. My focus will be to decentralise the decision making in telecom business and to reduce my participation. That way, I can focus on new ventures,? says Mittal. 

 Commenting on the few issues in telecom that needs to be sorted out, Mittal said his company will move the Supreme Court requesting for refund of Rs 135 crore.

 Bharti had sought the refund of licence fees for entry into basic services prior to the new uniform licensing regime introduced by the government.

 The company moved the Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) after the department of telecommunications (DoT) had rejected its demand. DoT said the entry fee was non-refundable.

 Bharti had surrendered the basic service licences for Delhi, Haryana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh following the government decision to issue unified access service licences (UASL).

 His vision for future of telecom products that will flood the Indian markets includes high-cash transaction over mobile phones. However, he points to the regulatory hurdles but feels that technology will sweep them away.

 Calcutta, July 13: MSTC expects a manifold increase in its business based on the e-auction platform.

 The company, which had a modest start in Internet-based trading three years ago, saw a sudden spurt in business in the first quarter of this financial year.

 The rise in business volume could be attributed to the tie-up with Coal India Ltd (CIL), which started selling coal for its non-core customers through the MSTC site.

 MSTC chairman and managing director Malay Sengupta said the company did business of Rs 600 crore in the April-June period compared with Rs 476 crore in the entire 2004-05.

 Asked if the fast pace of growth can be maintained throughout the year, Sengupta said it could come down in future. It should stabilise from this level, he added.

 Coal accounted for Rs 375 crore of the business in the first quarter.

 The platform also helped CIL get a better margin for the coal sale. Earlier, Coal India had to sell a lot at a single price point. However, the e-auction can provide different price points for a single lot, thereby achieving higher sales.

 At present, coal, scrap and some amount of pig iron are traded on this platform.

 Sengupta said the company was likely to introduce a few more items on this platform.

 MSTC is trying to strengthen the portal by joining hands with IBM.

 The primary criteria for us is to make the site available for multiple users simultaneously, he said.

 The site is being equipped to handle 5,000 users at a time.

 The e-auction platform has brought more transparency in the system, inducing confidence among the participants, Sengupta said.

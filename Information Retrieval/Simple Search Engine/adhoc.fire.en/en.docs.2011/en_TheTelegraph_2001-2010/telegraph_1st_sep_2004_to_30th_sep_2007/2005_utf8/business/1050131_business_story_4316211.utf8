 Mesco unit in Orissa goes on stream

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 All fired up

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 30: Mid-East Integrated Steels Ltd (Mesco) started hot metal production by commissioning its first blast furnace at Satya in Jajpur district on January 27.

 Though started in 1992 at Kalinga Nagar area of Duburi in Jajpur district as an 100 per cent export oriented unit in collaboration with Chinese company China Metallurgical Equipment Corporation, the proposed 1.5-million-tonne steel plant suffered a serious setback as its promoters failed to tie up necessary funds. 

 Afterwards, the project ran into rough weather after the owners, J. K. Singh and Rita Singh, were accused of defrauding the Orissa government to the tune of Rs 27 crore by pledging fake shares as security. Last October, the chairman and two directors of Mesco were chargesheeted by the CBI.

 Mired in controversy, the plant had been written off by many till the UK-based trading house, Stemcor, stepped in to provide the necessary funds for commissioning the project and buy its entire produce for the next 10 years. Stemcor has so far provided Rs 56 crore for the project.

 According to the agreement, Stemcor will provide or arrange funds for commissioning the plant in phases. Besides, it will supply coke at the prevailing international prices for 10 years and buy the total products of the Mesco plant. The UK-based MNC will also make available the letter of credit of $100 million at any point of time to meet the raw material requirements for two blast furnaces. 

 Stemcor chairman Ralph Openheimer said the products of the Mesco plant would be exported to other countries, while some portions would be sold in the domestic market, according to the Export Oriented Unit norms. He added that the details of funding would be finalised after a thorough discussion with the Mesco management after the field visit. Though the company intends to make integrated steel,it would manufacture pig iron for the time being as it does not have the necessary expertise to make steel, said Mesco chairman J. K. Singh.

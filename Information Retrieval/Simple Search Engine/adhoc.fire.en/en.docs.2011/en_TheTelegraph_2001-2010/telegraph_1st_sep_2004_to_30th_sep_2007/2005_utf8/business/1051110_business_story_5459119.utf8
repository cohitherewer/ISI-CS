 SingTel for hike in Bharti pie

 New Delhi, Nov. 9 (PTI): Singapore Telecommunications (SingTel), the largest foreign shareholder in Bharti Tele-Ventures, today said it could increase its stake in the company provided it got the right price.

 We are interested to increase our stake in Bharti Tele-Ventures. It depends on the right price and conditions, a SingTel spokesperson said from Singapore.

 We are the largest single shareholder (after the promoters with their 46 per cent stake) with our 31 per cent stake and have done very well on this investment, the spokesperson added.

 However, the company did not disclose how it would go about its interest as the Mittals, the Indian promoters with a controlling stake in the company, have already ruled out further stake dilution in the company from the current 46 per cent. Also, Vodafone has just entered with a 10 per cent stake. Of the 10 per cent Vodafone acquired, 4.39 per cent came from Bharti Enterprises. The remaining 5.61 per cent direct stake was bought from Warburg Pincus.

 Vodafone has stated that there would be no fixed rule for investments in the fast growing economy. Its future strategies in India would depend on asset prices and market dynamics.

 We look at these situations on the basis of adding value to our shareholders and much depends on the price at which assets and shares are available, Bobby Leach, head (group media relations) of Vodafone, had said. 

 Asked whether Vodafone would be comfortable in case SingTel decided to raise its stake in the company, Leach had said: I dont think they (SingTel) intend to increase the stake in Bharti. 

 A Bharti spokesperson had said: There are absolutely no plans to exit. Bharti continues to hold 45.90 per cent controlling interest in BTVL.

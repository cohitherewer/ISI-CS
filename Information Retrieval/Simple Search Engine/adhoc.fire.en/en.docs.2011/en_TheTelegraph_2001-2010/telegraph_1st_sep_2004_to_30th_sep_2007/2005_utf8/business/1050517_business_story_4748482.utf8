 Mumbai, May 16: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) will invest over Rs 2,100 crore in its retail and LPG businesses this fiscal. 

 In retail, the amount will be used to set up outlets and upgrading facilities. IOC, which had 10,228 petrol pumps on April 1, will set up 1000 more and a similar number of low-cost outlets called Kisan Sewa Kendras.

 In LPG, the corporation plans to set up two new Indane plants. 

 Around Rs 360 crore has been earmarked for setting up new depots at Mandia Hasaud in Madhya Pradesh, Lan Kuan in Uttaranchal and Kavarati and Minicoy near Kochi. While four tap-off points are under construction in various places, additional tankage is planned at Paradip and 10 other locations. 

 IOC will thus spend close to Rs 2,770 crore on infrastructure alone this year, which will be funded by internal accruals.

 IOC marketing director N. G. Kannan said during 2004-05, the company?s sales climbed to 48.2 million tonnes from 46.8 million tonnes last year, registering a 3 per cent increase and a turnaround from the negative growth witnessed till 2003-04. 

 The average throughput at the corporation was lower by around 7 per cent compared with the industry?s fall of 11 per cent, Kannan added.

 IOC has set up 1112 retail outlets in 2004-05. If 3272 outlets belonging to IBP is also included, the corporation will have 13,500 pumps.

 Acknowledging the fierce competition in the retail space from both public and private sector companies such as Reliance Industries and Essar Oil, Kannan said IOC planned to take them on by not only setting up more outlets but also adopting new initiatives. 

 The Kisan Sewa Kendras would not only sell petroleum products but also serve the rural community by offering financing facilities and providing insurance covers, farm equipment and seeds.

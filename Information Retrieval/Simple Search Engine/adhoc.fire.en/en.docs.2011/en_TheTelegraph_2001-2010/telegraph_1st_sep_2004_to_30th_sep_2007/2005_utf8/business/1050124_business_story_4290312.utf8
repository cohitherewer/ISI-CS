 Repay more as you grow old

Keeping in mind that it is the toughest to repay a 

home loan during the early period, HDFC has introduced the Easy EMI Home Loan 

scheme whereby one can pay smaller EMI for the first few years. 

 Through this product, customers, irrespective of their age, will be able to get a bigger amount than they would have through a normal housing loan. This is possible because while determining the loan eligibility of the customer, this product also takes into account the likely rise in future income thereby enhancing the loan amount. The EMI is increased gradually over the loan period.

 This would enhance the loan eligibility for a middle-aged customer who may not be eligible for a higher loan amount as he has a limited period of service left. 

 Suppose a 48-year old customer with an income of Rs 30,000 per month and 10 years of service left decides to take a 10-year loan at 8 per cent, he could get Rs 10 lakh with a normal loan. However, under easy EMI, he can get Rs 12 lakh by structuring the loan into three terms of three, three and four years with EMI of Rs 12,000 in the first term, Rs 14,425 in the second term and Rs 16,380 in the final term.

 The product will also maximise the customer?s tax benefits, as one will be deferring the payment of principal and hence may not exhaust the Rs 1, 50,000 per annum limit for the repayment of interest on home loans.

 Interest repayment of Rs 1,50,000 per annum can fetch customers tax savings of up to Rs 50,490 per annum depending on their tax bracket. Moreover, they can get added tax benefits under section 88. 

 Easy EMI?s are offered under the fixed rate of interest and can also be taken under a ?combination loan?.

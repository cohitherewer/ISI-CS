 Max India to focus on healthcare

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Singh: Looking ahead

 New Delhi, June 6: Max India plans to focus on its healthcare and insurance businesses and unwind its 2 per cent investment in Hutch when the telecom major comes out with an initial public offering (IPO) scheduled for later this year.

 We are planning to divest our 1.8 per cent stake in Hutchison India to take care of the financial needs of the company. We are waiting for an opportune moment, Max India joint managing director B. Anatharaman said here today.

 He said Hutch was expected to come out with an IPO in the last quarter of this fiscal and Max India would sell its stake around that time. 

 The money will be ploughed into its healthcare and insurance ventures, Anatharaman said.

 Max India has already started focusing on its healthcare venture, Max Healthcare Institute Limited, which is scheduled to receive a second equity infusion from Warburg Pincus, the private equity investment entity.

 Warburg will be investing another Rs 115 crore to pick up 28.75 million shares in the healthcare venture. Each Rs 10 share is being priced at Rs 40. After the second cash injection, Warburgs stake in Max Healthcare will rise to 23 per cent. Max India holds a 70 per cent stake in the company.

 Back in January, Warburg had invested Rs 25 crore in the venture and picked up the shares at Rs 13.25 each.

 Max India also said that Warburg Pincus has completed its balance investment of Rs 119 crore in the parent company, Max India. Warburg Pincus total investment in Max India now stands at Rs 200 crore. Warburg Pincus holds 10 million equity shares in Max India amounting to about 28.7 per cent.

 Max group chairman Analjit Singh said the partnership with Warburg Pincus would accelerate growth plans in the healthcare sector.

 No financial advisers were involved in these transactions.

 Charles Kaye, Co-President of Warburg Pincus LLC, said, Our investments in Max India and Max Healthcare reflects our belief in the underlying strengths of the business and the excellent growth opportunities that exist in the Indian market. Both businesses have already established a strong operating platform and demonstrated success.

 AZB Partners acted as the legal advisors to Max India Ltd. 

 Anantharaman said that with the latest cash infusion, Max Healthcare had tied up its long term funding needs for the Rs 600 crore healthcare project.

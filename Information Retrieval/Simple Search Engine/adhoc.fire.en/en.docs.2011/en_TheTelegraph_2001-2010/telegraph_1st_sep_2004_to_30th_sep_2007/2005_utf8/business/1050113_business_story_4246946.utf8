 Calcutta, Jan. 12: The London Stock Exchange (LSE) wants companies from emerging markets, including India, to list on the exchange.

 ?At present, we are focusing on the markets of Russia, China and India and are in talks with their companies to list on the LSE,? said Tracey Pierce, head of international business development at LSE.

 The LSE has introduced a separate trading platform called AIM to support smaller companies in their initial growth period. At present, there are 1,021 companies listed on AIM, of which 116 are international firms. 

 ?Indian companies have listed their depository receipts on the main exchange. However, with AIM, we expect the smaller companies to also get listed on the exchange,? said James Woodley, manager of India and Australia at LSE. Companies with a market capitalisation between $5 million and $100 million are considered as small-cap companies.

 ?Around 350 Indian firms have invested in the UK. As more companies venture overseas, they will access foreign capital markets,? said Woodley.

 ?We will also target the companies which are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and other companies, which comply with the international accounting standards,? Woodley added.

 ?At present, convertible bonds and global depository receipts (GDRs) are the preferred routes of raising capital by Indian companies,? said Pierce.

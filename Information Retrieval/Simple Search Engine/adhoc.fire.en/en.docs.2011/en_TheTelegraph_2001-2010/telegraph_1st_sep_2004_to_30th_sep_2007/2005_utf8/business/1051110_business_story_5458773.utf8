 Watchdog fear sparks security ramp-up

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi Nov. 9: Whats forcing corporate houses worldwide to put information security systems in place at their organisations? No, its neither worms nor viruses, but the fear of regulators wrath.

 According to a survey by Ernst and Young, a leading professional services provider, compliance with regulations is the primary driver of information security.

 About two-thirds of the respondents, representing 1,300 global companies, government and non-profit agencies in 55 countries, cited compliance with regulations ? such as Clause 49 of the listing agreement, Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the EUs 8th Directive or their equivalent ? as the primary reason for setting up information security systems. 

 Terry Thomas, partner of Ernst and Youngs technology and security risk services, said, Compliance is proving to be more of a distraction than a catalyst for information security to be strategically aligned within organisations. quot;

 Information security as a function has not yet become integral to their strategic initiatives. The gap continues to widen between the growing risks brought on by rapid changes in the global business environment and what information security is doing to address those risks. This pattern is consistent across organisations, regardless of size or location, he said.

 The survey also found that business demands and the declining cost of wireless connectivity are driving the rapid adoption of mobile technology.

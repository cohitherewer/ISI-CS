 Calcutta, July 26: Bank of Maharashtra is planning to increase its stake in Global Trade Finance, a company engaged in the factoring business.

 Set up in 2001, Global Trade Finance (GTF) has an equity capital of Rs 45 crore. It is a joint venture in which Finbank of Malta hold a 30 per cent stake, Exim Bank 35 per cent and IFC 25 per cent. The rest 10 per cent is held by Bank of Maharashtra.

 Talking to newspersons on the sidelines of the Banking Conclave organised by Ficci, S.C. Basu, chairman and managing director of the bank, said, Talks are on for increasing our stake in GTF. We cannot comment when it will be done.

 The banks investment in Global Trade is yielding encouraging returns, he added. The total business of GTF is nearly Rs 1,000 crore.

 GTF is primarily engaged in the factoring business. International or export factoring eases much of the credit and collection burden created by international sales. By outsourcing the credit function, exporters can convert the high fixed cost of operating an international credit department into a variable expense. 

 Commissions paid to the factor are based on sales volume, so costs fluctuate with actual sales, lowering operating costs during slow sales periods. 

 In addition to relieving exporters of the time-consuming administrative burden of approving credit and collecting export sales, export factoring allows exporters safely offer their foreign customers competitive open account terms. 

 Bank of Maharashtra is also planning a foray into international markets. It has applied to the Reserve Bank of India for opening representative offices in New York, London, Singapore and Dubai.

 The bank has no immediate plans to raise funds as its capital adequacy ratio is hovering around 12.6 per cent. It has set a business target of Rs 48,000 crore for the current financial year. The governments holding in the bank is to the tune of 77 per cent.

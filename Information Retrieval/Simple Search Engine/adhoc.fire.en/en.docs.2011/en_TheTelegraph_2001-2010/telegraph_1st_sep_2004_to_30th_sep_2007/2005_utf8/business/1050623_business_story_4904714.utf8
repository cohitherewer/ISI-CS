The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Beyond 7100 and still counting

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 22: Stocks continued to sizzle and the sensex surged past 7100 as the two powerful engines of India Inc ? Reliance Industries and Infosys Technologies ? hauled the market gravy train on the third day of a gravity-defying week. 

 The monsoon rain that lashed Mumbai today appeared to ignite the markets passion, leaving experts floundering for explanations.

 There are no fresh triggers for an up move just as there are no fresh triggers for a decline, said Jigar Shah of KR Choksey, a prominent broker.

 Breaching another psychological barrier of 7100, the main barometer of stock market sentiment ended up 68.82 points to scale a new high of 7145.34 with the outlook positive for further gains. In three days since the Ambani brothers settlement, it has climbed 238 points.

 There is no bubble yet, nor are there fears of an overvaluation as yet, said Shah. 

 In the coming days, the market will look for fresh triggers to sustain the bull run and these could come from the spate of first-quarter results from infotech companies like Wipro and Infosys that will start trickling in from July.

 The showers, which appear to have calmed monsoon anxieties, will also help keep the rally going.

 In all this euphoria over the sensexs historic high, however, the indices for small and medium companies closed in the red as their share prices receded after weeks of sustained bull charge. 

 Companies with a large market capitalisation that were under-performers in the recent past were playing catch-up. 

 Foreign funds continued to shovel money into the market and the latest to join the bandwagon was Nomura of Japan. The deluge of dollars strengthened the rupee for the fourth successive trading session. 

 Foreign institutional investors have bought a net $353 million in June after two months of selling. 

 Leading the rally today was Housing Development Finance Corporation, which rose 3.4 per cent after the UKs Standard Life sold a 4.9 per cent stake for $234 million. Index heavyweight Reliance Industries also climbed 1.5 per cent at Rs 655.50 on the BSE.

 Rupee rules firm

 The rupee today firmed up further against the dollar on strong trade and foreign fund inflows into the booming stock market. The currency ended at 43.55, 2.5 paise higher than Tuesdays close of 43.57. It touched a high of 43.50 today.

 New Delhi, April 29: India and Japan have formed a joint study group to consider ways to boost economic ties.

 ?This group will enable us to strengthen fundamental ties. The two countries are blessed with a huge potential but businessmen are yet to wake up to each others attraction,? Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi told industrialists at a meeting organised by the three apex chambers of commerce ? CII, Ficci and Assocham

 The Japanese Prime Minister did not agree with commerce minister Kamal Nath?s view that bilateral trade between the two countries has stagnated. On the contrary, Koizumi said, ?It is growing and is headed in the right direction.?

 He said trade between the two countries had jumped 16 per cent last year. Moreover, nearly 90 per cent of the 300 Japanese companies that had invested in India were planning to expand operations.

 According to a survey, India ranks third after Korea and China as a business destination for Japan. 

 Citing the example of Japanese automotive major Suzuki?s tearaway success in India, he hoped that more companies would set up shop here. 

 Koizumis visit is the first in five years by any Japanese Prime Minister. ?The worlds attention today is fixed on Indias breath-taking progress and on Asias new tidings,? he added.

 Koizumi said the formation of an East Asian community and the movement towards an Asian partnership would provide the right direction towards making it a century where Asia would dominate the world.

 Appreciating Indias ?look east? policy, Japan welcomed Indias participation in the upcoming East Asian summit. 

 Addressing the meeting, Nath expressed confidence that India and Japan could easily clock bilateral trade worth $10 billion in the next three years.

 While Indias trade relations with other Asian countries like China and Korea have improved considerably over the last few years, statistics reveal that trade with Japan has remained stagnant at $4 billion annually over the past eight years.

 Kamal Nath said actual cumulative inflow of investment from Japan was pegged at less than $2 billion. ?Japanese investment in India despite a large number of joint ventures and collaborations has remained at a low ebb,? the commerce minister said.

 Nath said sectors like infrastructure, telecom, power and construction are areas where Japanese businessmen could make use of the growing opportunities in this country.

 Posco wants ore supply surety

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Tall order 

 Bhubaneswar, Jan. 3: Korean steel giant Pohang Steel Co (Posco), which proposes to build a 10-million-tonne integrated steel plant in Orissa in two phases, has sought a 1-billion tonne iron ore reserve in the state.

 The state government is determined not to lose Posco and had sent an official delegation headed by chief secretary Subash Pani to South Korea last week.

 The delegation was told that Posco needs at least 1 billion tonnes of iron-ore. While assuring that the state government will take care of the raw material requirements, the delegation said the company?s demand for iron-ore reserve is a tall order.

 The delegation comprising steel and mines secretary Bhaskar Chatterjee and energy secretary R. N. Bohidar was accompanied by Posco?s India team leader Ryu Ho Chan. They returned from Seoul on Friday.

 Industry sources said the project requires around 960 million tonnes of iron-ore for 50 years. The state government?s policy assures raw material linkage to a new project for 25 years. 

 The company is also keen to take up abandoned mines for harnessing residual reserves of raw material as there is a large wastage, especially minerals of marginal grades in the state.

 While the government has made commitments for the existing plants, allocation of mines has to be made on a realistic basis keeping the future demand in mind, the delegation said. 

 Official sources said the Posco management also wanted to know the stability of the ruling BJD-BJP coalition government.

 In August, Posco had announced its plans to build a 10-million tonne integrated steel plant in Orissa with BHP Billiton, the world?s biggest mining company. The Rs 39,000-crore project is a big-ticket foreign investment for the country as well as for the state.

 The first phase of the project with a capacity of 3 million tonnes is likely to be ready in 2009. The company expects to provide employment to 42,000 people in the region.

 The team had visited Posco?s steel plants at Pohang and Gwyangyang and surveyed the facilities available, including ports.

 During discussions with the delegation, Posco bosses had sought details about the infrastructure available and firm commitment on the availability of iron-ore, coal and other raw materials.

 They wanted everything in detail as the company is venturing out for the first time with a huge investment.

 Though Posco had shortlisted three locations for the project, Duburi, Dhamra and Paradip, it selected Dhamra. The Korean company is reportedly in favour of Dhamra because of its proximity to the natural deepwater port. The government has assured Posco that the Dhamra port could handle cape-sized vessels.

 In October last year, an eight-member Posco team had visited Dhamra in Bhadrak district and Duburi in Jajpur district.

 If the Posco project comes through, then Orissa?s target of Rs 75,000-crore investment in the next three to four years can be achieved. Official sources said Posco is also weighing options in Brazil and China and both countries are making serious efforts to woo the steel major. 

 Posco?s Gwangyang plant is the most compact integrated steel plant in the world with the Finex process. The process makes it possible to use iron-ore fines, which are normally wasted.

 The Korean steel major, which produces 30 per cent of total steel production in the world, is keen to set up the steel plant despite speculations that it was scouting for places in Brazil and other Latin American countries.

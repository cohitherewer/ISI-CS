 New Delhi, Dec. 21: The empowered group of ministers on airports today decided to set up a committee of secretaries headed by the cabinet secretary to help it prepare the final recommendations on the bidding process for modernising Delhi and Mumbai airports.

 The move follows allegations by Left parties that bidders were being favoured by the government and that consultants to the bidding process had links with them. There were also apprehensions that the ratings given to various bids were faulty. 

 An inter-ministerial group on airport bidding had earlier recommended Reliance-ASA Mexico and GMR-Fraport as the two shortlisted bidders. Besides the two, Subhash Chandras Essel Group, Sterlite and London-based DS Constructions had filed their bids for Delhi and Mumbai airports.

 Five of the six consortia had bid for both Rs 2,800-crore Delhi airport update and Rs 2,600-crore Mumbai airport modernisation plans. GVK Industries had only bid for Mumbai airport.

 The new panel will submit its report within a fortnight. After going through the reports of the government review committee and the inter-ministerial group, the eGoM has decided to set up a committee headed by the cabinet secretary to recommend on how to go ahead with the process, civil aviation minister Praful Patel told newspersons after the one-and-a-half-hour meeting.

 The other members of the review panel are secretaries from the ministries of civil aviation, economic affairs, law and member secretary of the Planning Commission.

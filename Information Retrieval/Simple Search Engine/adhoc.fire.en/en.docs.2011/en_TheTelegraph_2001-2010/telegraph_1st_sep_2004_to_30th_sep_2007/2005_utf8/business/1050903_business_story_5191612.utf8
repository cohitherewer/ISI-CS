 Govt ends selloff lull with Maruti

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ready to roll

 New Delhi, Sept. 2: The government kick-started its stalled disinvestment plan today, announcing plans to sell an 8 per cent stake in Maruti Udyog Ltd.

 The stake will be sold to state-run financial institutions and banks through open bidding, defence minister Pranab Mukherjee said after a meeting of the cabinet that cleared the move.

 Divestment has been put on hold for the last few months because of a row between the ruling Congress party and its Left allies over the PSUs to be divested and the manner in which it should be carried out.

 The Maruti stake sale was chosen carefully so that the Left parties were not offended. The effort appeared to have paid off. ?What will the government do with residual stakes when these companies have already been privatised. It has no control over these companies but its money is stuck there. Sale of residual stake in already privatised PSUs is an insignificant matter,? CPM leader Sitaram Yechury said.

 The Maruti share sale cannot be described as divestment in the real sense of the term as it would mean one state-run entity (the FIs) buying the government?s shares in another firm. The sale is expected to be followed up by initial public offerings in Indian Airlines and Air-India. A Syndicate Bank issue is also on the cards.

 Maruti, which has a 50 per cent share in the domestic car market, is 54.2 per cent owned by Suzuki Motor of Japan. The government sold 25 per cent of the firm in an initial public offering two years back, retaining an 18.2 per cent stake. The share sale cleared today could fetch Rs 1,000 crore, which will be parked in the divestment fund. This is a corpus used to revive sick PSUs. Maruti shares rose 5.7 per cent to Rs 512.90 on the BSE after the selloff plans were announced.

 ?The unlocking of the amount from non-strategic investments will mobilise resources the government can use in sectors requiring attention,? Mukherjee said.

 Officials said the government will retain the remaining stake of over 10 per cent in Maruti as it is keen to keep a nominee on the company?s board. Divestment helps it raise the money it sorely needs for key projects.

 Officials are banking on extra-budgetary schemes like the selloff programme to earn enough money to fund basic education and part of the healthcare bill.

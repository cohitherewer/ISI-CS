 New Delhi, Aug. 20: The World Bank is willing to lend $3 billion for the ambitious Rs 1,74,000-crore Bharat Nirman project to develop rural infrastructure in the country. 

 World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz, who concluded his four-day visit to India today, said the loan for Bharat Nirman would be part of the $9-billion assistance that the bank has committed to the country over the next three years. The World Bank has doubled its annual assistance to India from $1.4 billion to $2.9 billion in 2004-05.

 Wolfowitz said the bank would explore ways of creating a fund that would bridge any viable financing gap in the countrys infrastructure projects to encourage private-public partnership. The fund would require $100 billion investment in the next seven years, he said.

 The World Bank president also pointed out that creating physical infrastructure in power, highways, ports, airports and railways require huge funding and since the public sector on its own would be unable to generate such volumes, the private sector must harness its resources, too. The viability gap fund is expected to fulfil this requirement. 

 Wolfowitz had discussions with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, finance minister P. Chidambaram and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, who presented a case for higher bank assistance for improving roads, irrigation, drinking water and sanitation facilities.

 In-principle, we want to do more. But I dont think it would be possible to scale up total lending at the present juncture. I feel $3 billion is a considerable amount and India is the largest recipient of World Bank loans, Wolfowitz said.

 Gail reaps profit in China

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 7: Gail (India) Ltd has made a killing by investing in China Gas Holdings Limited.

 The stock of the Chinese company has appreciated by 35 per cent from the price Gail had agreed to pay on February 24.

 The state-run gas marketing major said it would buy 210 million shares or 10 per cent of the existing equity at a negotiated price of HK $1.158 per share resulting in a cash outgo of Rs 137 crore. The payment will be made in the next two months.

 As on March 4, the stock of China Gas Holdings Limited has been quoted at HK$ 1.56 per share at the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.

 Although the investment by Gail is strategic in nature, the appreciation in the stock price has reinforced the PSU?s decision to buy into the Chinese firm, which will provide it with a foothold in the fastest growing economy of the world. The Chinese company has also sold 10 per cent to Korea Gas Corporation (Kogas), South Korea?s dominant gas supplier, and City Gas Pte Ltd, the gas distributor company of Temasek Holdings, Singapore?s state-owned investment company. 

 China Gas supplies gas to more than 200,000 households and 2,000 industrial and commercial users in China where it has more than 50 natural gas projects. 

 Both companies plan to create a joint venture to set up urban gas networks and long-distance pipelines. The venture will also sell and distribute liquefied petroleum gas. 

 Gail?s other overseas investments have been faring well, too.

 Shell raises capex kitty

 Output boost

 London, Dec. 13 (Reuters): Royal Dutch Shell is having to raise its annual investment by at least $4 billion (?2 billion) in 2006 and the years following as costs soar and the firm tries to turn round its industry-lagging record for finding new oil, the company revealed on Tuesday.

 The Anglo-Dutch group, the worlds third-largest listed oil firm by market capitalisation, said its capital investment budget for 2006 would be $19 billion, up from earlier plans of around $15 billion. Chief financial officer Peter Voser told reporters on a conference call that beyond 2006, the firm was likely to invest at least $19 billion annually.

 It was unclear to what extent the rise in spending plans was due to higher than expected costs and what portion, was due to more ambitious exploration and project development plans.

 Analysts had expected Shell to raise its budget to between $17 billion and $20 billion per year but some hoped for the news to be counterbalanced by a more optimistic outlook.

 Despite the increase, there is nothing to suggest that the group will be able to increase its growth prospects, which should depress returns, Peter Hitchens, oil analyst at Teather amp; Greenwood, said.

 The budget increase excludes the minority share of Sakhalin-2, a large oil and gas project off Russias east coast where costs have doubled to $20 billion. Sakhalin-2 is one of a number of major Shell projects, including the Bonga oil field offshore Nigeria, that are currently over budget.

 Following the announcement of the Sakhalin-2 cost overruns in July, Shell said its medium-term guidance for capital expenditure of $15 billion per annum after 2005 was no longer valid.

 Shell hopes the added expenditure will enable it to unlock 13 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) by 2009.

 Voser said the firm was still reasonably confident of reaching its 100 per cent reserve replacement target ? the level at which a firm is replacing every barrel it pumps with new finds ? over the 2004-08 period.

 Shell aims to raise production to 3.8-4 million BOE per day (BOEPD) by 2009 and 4.5-5 million BOEPD by 2014, compared with the current production of around 3.5 million BOEPD, Voser said. 

 Shell will continue its share buyback programme into 2006, Voser said, although he would not give details.

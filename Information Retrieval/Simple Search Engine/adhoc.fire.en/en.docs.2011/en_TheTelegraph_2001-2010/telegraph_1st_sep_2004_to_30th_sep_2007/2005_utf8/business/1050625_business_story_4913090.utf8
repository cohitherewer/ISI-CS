 Sun-burnt banks in probe mode

 Mumbai, June 24: As confidential data on British customers of leading foreign banks spilled into the public domain, authorities in the UK have started investigating the serious security lapse even as the foreign bank officials deny any links with Infinity eSearch, a Gurgaon-based web hosting outfit. 

 The Sun, a leading British tabloid, published a story alleging that an IT worker Kkaran Bahree sold its reporter confidential information on bank accounts, credit card details and personal data of 1000 British customers for $5000. 

 The Sun report had claimed that eight banks, which included HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds (TSB), Abbey, Woolwich, Royal Bank of Scotland and Nationwide, saw confidential details of their clients being sold by an Indian IT worker. 

 The foreign banks, who have been on an aggressive spree to outsource their back office operations to Indian subsidiaries in their bid to cut costs, are now trying to investigate how the leaks took place in the first place as many of the banks have no connection with Infinity eSearch. 

 HSBC, one of the eight banks which has a sizeable presence in India with plans to add an outsourcing hub in Calcutta to its existing three in India, has denied any connection with the Gurgaon firm. 

 ?We have no relation with any third party for that matter,? said Malini Thadani, the spokesperson for the bank. ?Everything we do is done in-house.? 

 ?All our work is done by our employees, using our premises and our equipment,? she added. 

 Doubts have been expressed about how Bahree came into possession of the critical data if there was no connection or transaction between the two firms. 

 Thadani said investigations were now being carried out by the UK authorities. ?At this moment, we can?t speculate on such issues,? she said when asked whether there had been a breach of security at HSBC?s data processing arm in India. 

 British bank Barclays has set up its back office hub by outsourcing nearly 5000 jobs to India. The move involved transferring about half the banks call centre activities. 

 HSBC already has about 4000 employees affiliated to its outsourcing centres in India. Britain?s fifth largest bank Lloyds TSB had closed down its call centre in Newcastle and shifted the jobs to its Bangalore outfit late last year. 

 Nasscom, the representative body of Indian software companies, has been on the back foot ever since a few rogue employees of MphasiS outfit in Pune used credit card details of US customers to enrich themselves.

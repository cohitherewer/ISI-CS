 IBM score dwarfs forecasts

 STEVE LOHR 

 High expectations 

 New York, Oct. 18: IBM 

 delivered a solid quarterly performance on Monday with earnings 

 exceeding Wall Streets expectations, suggesting that 

 corporate spending on information technology is picking 

 up modestly. 

 IBM, the worlds largest 

 ITcompany, is closely watched as a barometer of business 

 spending on technology. About one dollar of every $10 spent 

 by corporations worldwide on IT is spent on IBM hardware 

 or software. 

 The companys quarterly performance 

 reflects broader trends beyond a general improvement in 

 technology spending. For example, technology companies, 

 such as IBM and Accenture, are shifting toward higher-profit 

 services, taking over and automating business processes 

 like procurement, finance, and human resources. 

 But the sharply improved profits 

 are also attributable to IBM itself. Earlier this year, 

 the company trimmed its payroll by 14,500 workers and reported 

 a strong quarter from its microelectronics unit, which is 

 the sole supplier of the chips that power Microsofts 

 Xbox video console. 

 Samuel J. Palmisano, IBMs 

 chief executive, said the company had a good quarter 

 that demonstrated the strength of our business model 

 across hardware, software and services. 

 Investors apparently agreed. IBM 

 shares rose after the release of the quarterly results, 

 by $1.89 to $84.48 a share. 

 IBM reported after-tax profit 

 of 94 cents a share, including a one-time charge of 32 cents, 

 or $525 million. 

 Excluding the one-time charge, 

 IBM had a profit of $1.26 a share, or 22 per cent higher 

 than a year ago, when it reported quarterly earnings of 

 $1.03 a share. The performance easily surpassed the consensus 

 earnings estimate among Wall Street analysts of $1.13 a 

 share, according to Thomson First Call. 

 Revenue stood at $21.5 billion 

 in the quarter, about $200 million less than analysts had 

 projected and 8 per cent less than the year-earlier quarter.

 IBMs hardware sales fell 

 32 per cent but software sales rose 5 per cent.

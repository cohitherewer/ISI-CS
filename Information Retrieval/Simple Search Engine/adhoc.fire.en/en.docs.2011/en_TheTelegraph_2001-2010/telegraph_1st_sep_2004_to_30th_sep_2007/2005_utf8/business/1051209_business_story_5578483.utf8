 Suzuki in court to slam brakes on parade of the fakes

 Go for the real 

 New Delhi, Dec. 8: Suzuki Motor Corporation has filed suits in Delhi High Court against 10 companies that have been illegally passing off Suzuki as their trademark or using it in their corporate identities.

 The firms, which are from businesses as diverse as finance, textile manufacturing, spinning and weaving, face an injunction that the Japanese giant plans to secure.

 ?Through the suits, Suzuki Motor Corporation wants an injunction against the use of the word Suzuki by these firms,? a statement issued by the company said.

 The company has asserted its legal right to the exclusive use of the Suzuki registered trademark. ?The 10 companies against whom SMC has filed the suits are using the word Suzuki without our permission,? it said.

 Suzuki made it clear that it was forced to haul the firms to the courtroom after they continued to use the name and cocked a snook at its numerous cease-and-desist notices.

 In India, Suzuki Motor Company has authorised only Maruti to use the brand name for cars and Suzuki Motorcycle India Private Ltd for two-wheelers, the statement said.

 The new legal jousting is a replay of an incident in May, when SMC had filed a case in Delhi High Court against a proprietorship firm masquerading as Suzuki Motors. The outfit had been doing so without the firm?s permission. The auto-maker had been successful in securing an injunction that stopped the said firm from using Suzuki as part of its corporate name.

 The scramble to protect its brand identity comes at a time when Suzuki has lined up investments of Rs 6,000 crore. Some of that money will be poured into a new Haryana car plant to manufacture high-end four-wheelers. Foreign investment clearance for the unit, to be set as a joint venture with a 30 per cent Suzuki stake, has arrived.

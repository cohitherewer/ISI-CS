 M amp;M to infuse funds in auto parts arm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 27: Mahindra amp; Mahindra Ltd (M amp;M) will infuse fresh funds into its auto component subsidiary ? Mahindra Automotive Steels Pvt Ltd (MASPL).

 The M amp;M board will meet on May 30 to consider investments in MASPL in one or more tranches to enable the arm to fund its acquisition and growth plans, the company has informed the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 The board of the subsidiary will also meet on the same day to consider a merger proposal of the Chakan unit of Amforge Industries Ltd with itself.

 The MASPL board will consider appointing legal advisers and valuers to draft the scheme of arrangement and valuation of the Chakan undertaking of Amforge and determine the appropriate terms of the merger, including consideration, M amp;M added.

 The M amp;M directors will also consider a proposal to amend the objects clause of the Memorandum of Association of the company to enable it to carry on the business of engine applications, defence equipment and security services.

 The stress on the auto component business comes at a time when India has become an attractive outsourcing destination for many automobile majors. Companies like Bharat Forge have already tasted huge success.

 M amp;M will also announce its fourth-quarter results on May 30. Earlier this year, the automobile and tractor major had announced a 52 per cent rise in net profit for the third quarter at Rs 133.2 crore compared with Rs. 87.4 crore in the corresponding period last year.

 The company posted these figures despite rising input prices and the company weathered the impact of this price rise by focusing on cost-cutting initiatives. During the period, the companys total income (net of excise) increased to Rs 1794.51 crore from Rs 1347.6 crore in the same period last year.

 M amp;M had recently joined hands with French car major Renault to make the Logan, a mid-size sedan, in India. Experts say that M amp;M-Renault car venture would also require a strong ancillary vendor base to sustain the venture.

 The companys move to build its auto component business has partly to do with the new venture, they added.

 Tata windfall for users

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 16: Tata Indicom today unveiled the cheapest pre-paid rates in the country.

 Trying to rustle up subscriber numbers like its peers Reliance Infocomm, Bharti Tele-Ventures and BSNL, Tata Teleservices, with a subscriber base of 5.2 million, has announced free local calls between Tata Indicom mobiles within a state.

 Tata Teleservices president (marketing) Harish Bhat said, ?The prepaid category continues to be the real driver for the unprecedented growth of the domestic mobile market. By offering the most affordable ?0123 plan?, which is in line with the philosophy of offering 100 per cent talktime, we have enhanced the value proposition on our True Paid service.? 

 This plan offers a talktime of Rs 163 and Rs 318 on two Talk More recharge vouchers of Rs 180 and Rs 350.

 All existing Tata Indicom True Paid customers, who have recharged with either the Rs 180 or the Rs 350 Talk More recharge vouchers, will also get the benefit of free Tata-to-Tata local mobile calls.

 Subscribers have to pay Re 1 per minute for local calls made to a Tata Indicom Walky, fixed-line phones and other mobiles within the state, Rs 2 per minute for calls to any other local landlines within the state and Rs 3 per minute for STD calls to any number.

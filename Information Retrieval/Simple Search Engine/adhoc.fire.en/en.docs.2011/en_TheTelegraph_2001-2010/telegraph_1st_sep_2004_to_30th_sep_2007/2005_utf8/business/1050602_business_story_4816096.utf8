 Govt pulls a rabbit out of fiscal hat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 1: Indias fiscal deficit in 2004-05 stood at 4.11 per cent, well below the governments proclaimed target of 4.5 per cent. This prompted rating agency Standard amp; Poors to describe the state of government finances as encouraging.

 Figures released by the government showed the fiscal deficit at Rs 1,27,975 crore during 2004-05, up from Rs 1,25,960 crore in the previous fiscal. North Block revenue officials said steps to curb wasteful expenses and collection of tax arrears had resulted in the lower deficit. It was primarily on account of a lower revenue deficit that lower fiscal deficit has been achieved. 

 The figures also imply the government has managed to stick to a deficit reduction act in which it is supposed to cut the deficit-to-GDP ratio by 0.3 percentage point every year. 

 It has successfully reduced the deficit to 4.11 per cent from 4.5 per cent in the previous year. Officials said this was the lowest fiscal deficit in percentage terms in the last eight years. 

 However, given the current spending trends, it is unlikely that the government will be able to better this figure this fiscal, officials believe. We expect revenues to grow at about 17 per cent in 2005-06 compared with 20 per cent last fiscal because spending on big ticket infrastructure projects like highways, airports and ports have been stepped up. It will be difficult for the government to bring another rabbit out of the hat, officials said. 

 They are also worried about the aggregate deficit of states, which is expected to be larger than the central deficit. Rating agencies like S amp;P will keep a sharp eye on this figure before deciding on any re-appraisal of Indias current sovereign rating. 

 The Prime Ministers Office has already asked the Planning Commission and the finance ministry to work out ways to reduce states fiscal deficit and guide them into improving their financial positions. 

 A meeting of the full Planning Commission on this issue, chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, is expected next week. 

 Loan schedule

 The government has raised Rs 27,000 crore from the market till May 27 and is scheduled to borrow another Rs 10,000 crore this week.

 The government has completed gross borrowings to the tune of Rs 27,000 crore against annual budgeted gross borrowings of Rs 1,39,467 crore in 2005-06, PNB Gilts said in a report.

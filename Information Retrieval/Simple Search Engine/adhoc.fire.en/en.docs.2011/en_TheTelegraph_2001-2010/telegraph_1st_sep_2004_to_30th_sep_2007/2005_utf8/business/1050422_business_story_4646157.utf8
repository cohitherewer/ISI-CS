 Hyderabad, April 21: Satyam Computer Services Ltd aims to join the billion-dollar club by 2006, chairman B. Ramalinga Raju said while releasing the company?s fourth-quarter results for 2004-05.

 Satyam has recorded a better-than-expected 51.4 per cent rise in its quarterly net profit at Rs 213.2 crore compared with Rs 140.84 crore in the corresponding period last year. The revenue increased 32.3 per cent at Rs 953.7 crore. 

 Satyam has posted a 34.98 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 750.26 crore for the year ended March 31 and recommended a final dividend of 150 per cent for 2004-05. The net profit in 2003-04 was Rs 555.79 crore.

 The revenue guidance for 2005-06 is Rs 4,502 crore against Rs 3521 crore in 2004-05, implying a growth rate of 26 to 28 per cent and EPS of Rs 26.84-27.30.

 ?We are gearing up for continued growth and opportunity to enhance our global footprint and client-based services,? said Raju.

 The final dividend of 150 per cent (Rs 3 per share), including an interim dividend of Rs 100, takes the total payout for 2004-05 to 250 per cent against the guidance of 200 per cent, Raju said. 

 New verticals like healthcare, retail, travel, oil and gas have been important contributors to revenues.

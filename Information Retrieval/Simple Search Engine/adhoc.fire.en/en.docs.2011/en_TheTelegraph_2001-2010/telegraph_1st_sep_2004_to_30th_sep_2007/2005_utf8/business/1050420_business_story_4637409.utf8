 Adobe to buy Macromedia

 DAVID COLKER

 Charting the growth trajectory 

 Los Angeles, April 19: Adobe Systems Inc on Monday announced that it planned to buy Macromedia Inc in an all-stock deal valued at more than $3 billion. 

 The deal would bring together a pair of California-based companies that are successful in different realms of the publishing software business ? and help ward off anticipated challenges from Microsoft Corp. 

 Adobe is best-known for photo and design programmes and for software that converts documents into so-called PDF files, a kind of universal format viewable on any computer. Macromedia?s products include its Flash animation, widely used on Web sites and on mobile devices. 

 ?Strategically it makes a lot of sense for both companies,? said research analyst Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray amp; Co. ?Both need to grow ? especially in the emerging mobile market ? and instead of fighting each other in areas where they might not win, they get the proven products in one company?

 But some analysts said the price, which will provide 0.69 share of Adobe stock for each share of Macromedia, was steep. 

 ?That will not be particularly helpful in the short term,? said financial analyst Drew Brosseau of SG Cowen Securities. 

 Wall Street reflected that view, sending shares of Adobe down $5.89 on Monday, or nearly 10 per cent, to $54.77 on Nasdaq. The decline dropped the value of the deal from $3.4 billion ? based on Fridays price ? to less than $3.1 billion. Macromedia shares Monday gained $3.27, or nearly 10 percent, to $36.72 on Nasdaq. 

 The deal ? which needs to be approved by shareholders of both companies and to clear regulatory scrutiny ? is expected to close in the fall, according to an Adobe statement. 

 Macromedia shareholders would end up with 18 per cent of the combined company, which will keep Adobe?s name and San Jose, California, headquarters. Adobe?s chief executive, Bruce Chizen, would remain in that post; Macromedia?s current chief executive, Stephen Elop, would be the president of worldwide field operations.

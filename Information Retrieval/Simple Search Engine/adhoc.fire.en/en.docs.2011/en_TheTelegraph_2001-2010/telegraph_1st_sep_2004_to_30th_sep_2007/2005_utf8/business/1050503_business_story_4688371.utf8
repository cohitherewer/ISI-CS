 Calcutta, May 2: Blackberrys ? a premium men?s clothing brand ? plans to tap new markets and also expand its range of products as part of its growth strategy.

 General manager (sales) Badal Chaudhry said, ?We had finalised a major expansion plan last year and are moving towards vertical and horizontal growth. To capitalise on the increasing popularity of the brand, we plan to expand our operations by setting up more branded shops as well as increase the presence in retail or multi-branded outlets.?

 The brand, which started off with suits and jackets, moved into men?s trousers, both formal and informal.

 ?We will introduce a range of men?s shirts and women?s trousers and tops soon,? said Chaudhry. 

 ?The product portfolio expansion is part of our efforts to tap the immense potential that the readymade garment market offers. Also with the expansion of retail chains across the country, there is an increased demand,? he added.

 The company is ramping up its presence across the country with 50 exclusive outlets expected to come up by the end of this financial year. 

 Currently, there are 11 stores in 8 cities. The brand is available in 600 outlets across 150 cities.

 ?At present, only 10 per cent of our sales is from the brand stores,? said Chaudhry. 

 ?With the expansion plans, this is expected to go up significantly. We plan to invest around Rs 15 crore this year in a phased manner,? he added.

 Blackberrys is also putting in place its export strategy and is in the process of doubling the capacity of its Gurgaon unit to meet future growth and export needs. The company churns out 1500 trousers, 200 shirts and 200 suits and jackets daily.

 ?We are exploring possibilities of exports and already have a store in Dubai to test waters,? added Chaudhry. 

 ?With exports, our market share could go up by 2 per cent from the current 20 per cent,? he said.

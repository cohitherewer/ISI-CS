 Preference share route closed for insurers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 26: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) today barred insurers, reinsurers and intermediaries as well as brokerages from infusing capital through the issue of preference shares or any other hybrid instruments other than equity shares.

 No insurance company shall issue any form of shares or hybrid instruments other than equity. Immediate steps should be taken to redeem such instruments under a time-bound programme, which has the prior approval of the authority, read the circular issued by the regulator.

 Preference shares are instruments that carry no voting rights but are usually entitled to a higher dividend. Nowadays, few companies issue preference shares, though it used to be quite common in the 1970s and early 1980s. Subsequently, a strong equity culture was built up in India. Insurance companies said they would abide by the rules set by the regulator.

 We are certainly not adopting the route of preference shares to bring in capital and we do not intend to do it in the future either, said Frank Koster, managing director and CEO of ING Vysya Life Insurance Co.

 The IRDA issued the circular after some insurers and intermediaries had sought clarification as to whether they could issue preference shares or certain other forms of hybrid instruments for increasing the capital base.

 Non-compliance with the requirement would be viewed seriously, the regulator has warned in the circular.

 The Insurance Act, 1938, provides that no public limited company by shares shall carry on life insurance business unless its paid up capital consists of only ordinary shares, each of which has a single face value.

 According to the act, the same rules apply to general insurance companies as well.

 Under the present norms, insurance companies are allowed to raise the equity base by infusing capital at periodic intervals. However, the insurer could effect transfer of equity shares with the prior approval of the regulator, IRDA said.

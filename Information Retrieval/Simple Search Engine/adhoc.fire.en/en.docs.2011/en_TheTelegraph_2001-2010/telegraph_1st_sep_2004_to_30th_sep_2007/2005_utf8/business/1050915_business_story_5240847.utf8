 Samsung plans local cellphone unit

 Seoul, Sept. 14 (Reuters): Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Wednesday it was considering building a mobile phone plant in India, the worlds fastest growing wireless market.

 India had 63 million mobile phone users as of August and its rock bottom tariffs are luring about 2.5 million new users into the booming market each month.

 Given the Indian markets importance, we have been considering a mobile phone plant there, a spokeswoman for the South Korean firm said by telephone. But there is nothing concrete yet.

 South Koreas Yonhap News agency cited an unidentified source as saying that Samsung was looking at potential sites in Noida, near New Delhi, and Mumbai.

 The investment size had not yet been set, the source was quoted as saying.

 Motorola Inc, the worlds second-largest mobile phone company, said in August it would consider making telecom equipment in India.

 Samsung, the worlds No. 3 mobile phone maker, is targeting sales of 100 million global mobile phones this year, up 16 per cent from 2004.

 Nokia is planning to set up its global network operations centre in India. It has zeroed in on two sites. The centre will manage the networks of mobile service providers globally.

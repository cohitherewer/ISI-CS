 Reliance Info gets tribunal breather

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 20: Reliance Infocomm today earned a breather from the Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) that directed the department of telecommunications (DoT) to stop recovery of Rs 150 crore penalty till February 8.

 DoT had levied a penalty on Reliance Infocomm, alleging that it had diverted the STD and ISD calls as local calls and thus avoided payment of access deficit charge (ADC), which was a violation of the licence conditions.

 Refuting the allegation by Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd, the private telecom company contended that the access deficit charge (ADC) had been paid to the two operators. The company said the international long distance (ILD) operator had to pay ADC to the fixed line operator in whose network the international call was terminated. Hence, the demand of Rs 550 crore with allegation that international calls were routed as local calls was a false claim by the two public sector companies, Reliance Infocomm said.

 While hearing the appeal made by Reliance Infocomm against the DoT move, the tribunal directed that ?there should be no recovery till the next date of hearing on February 7?.

 Reliance Infocomm had moved the TDSAT earlier this week, challenging the penalty imposed on it by DoT.

 Hearing the petition, TDSAT chairman Justice D. P. Wadhwa ruled that no further action be taken till the case came up for hearing.

 In its directive, TDSAT said, ?DoT should not ?precipitate? action on the recovery of the penalty till further hearing.? He also asked DoT to file a reply on petition filed by Reliance Infocomm within the next 10 days, while scheduling the next date of hearing on February 8.

 However, Harish Salve, appearing for Reliance Infocomm, claimed that the TDSATs directive was virtually a stay on the DoT?s order.

 This was contested by C. A. Sunderam, the counsel for DoT, and pointed out that ?the order (given by DoT) stands it has not been stayed. We will just wait and see till the next hearing.? 

 Salve had argued that the Government cannot impose a penalty unilaterally and sought examination by an independent authority, if there was a breach or violation of the licence conditions.

 ?There is no finding by any independent authority that Reliance has breached the terms and conditions of licence,? argued Salve.

 Meanwhile, Delhi High Court said today that it would hear about whether it had the jurisdiction to hear the dispute between the licensor and licensee and also the merits of the case.

 Last year, a single member division bench of Delhi High court had directed RiM to pay Rs 100 crore (Rs 60 crore +Rs 40 crore in two tranches). However, BSNL filed an application in the Supreme Court that directed RiM to pay the full penalty alleged by DoT (Rs 187 crore) and asked the division bench to hear the case further.

 Coal marketing set to go high-tech

 Calcutta, Jan. 15: Coal marketing is set to go high-tech with Coal India (CIL) planning to introduce electronic auction in a big way. 

 Apart from bringing about transparency in coal marketing, the move will help eliminate difference between linked and non-linked consumers as directed by Calcutta High Court, CIL chairman Sashi Kumar said here today.

 Incidentally, a market-determined price under e-auction mode will mean a higher revenue for coal companies. 

 The public sector trading company, MSTC Ltd, during trial e-auction of coal produced by Bharat Coking Coal Ltd, (BCCL), sold 1.4 lakh tonnes to rail-linked non-core consumers. Kumar said all coal producing subsidiaries would be asked to join the MSTC?s auction floor. 

 Initially, about 20 million tonnes or about 7 per cent of non-coking coal produced by CIL and its subsidiaries would be on offer through e-auction.

 Kumar said the e-auction of coal is bound to be popular as consumers would get coal of their choice by paying a market determined price. In due course, he said, CIL would make e-auction the main marketing mode for all consumers other than power utilities. 

 During the April-December period of the current financial year, CIL has registered a profit of Rs 4,434 crore against the original projection of Rs 2,044 crore, Kumar said. Production stood at 228.56 million tonnes, 14.62 million tonnes higher than what was produced in the same period last year. Production by the end of this fiscal would be around 331 million tonnes.

 Taking a dig at the private sector, Coal India chairman said captive mining of coal by power, cement and steel industries is dismal. Only four out of 46 parties who were allotted coal blocks could go on stream and produced just about eight million tonnes in 2003-04. These 46 blocks had an estimated reserve of five billion tonnes.

 There could be various reasons for the failure of the private sector, which included delayed completion of end-use projects, land acquisition and possession.

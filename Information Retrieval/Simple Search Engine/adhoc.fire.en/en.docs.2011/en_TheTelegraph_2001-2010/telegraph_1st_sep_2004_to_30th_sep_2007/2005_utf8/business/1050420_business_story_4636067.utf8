 Calcutta, April 19: Oracle plans to tap the small and medium enterprise (SME) market and has drawn up a strategy to boost revenues from this segment.

 Oracle India director, technology sales, Arunava Dutta said the company had acquired 170 customers in the December to February quarter. ?After the wins, we realised that the market was ready for growth. The focus will not only be on 46,000 companies in the SME segment but also on small towns and cities where we see good growth.?

 ?We have tailored the technology solutions to meet the needs of the mid-market segment. The key drivers for this segment will be companies in the textile, retail, pharmaceuticals, engineering, auto-components, IT and financial services industries,? said Dutta.

 IDC estimates that the mid-market segment will grow at a CAGR of 21 per cent between 2004 and 2008.

 ?The segment will grow by 15 per cent year-on-year,? said Dutta. ?We expect our growth to commensurate the industry rate.?

 India is the fifth largest revenue earner for Oracle and a leader in the database market with a 41.3 per cent share.

 Dutta said the mid-sized companies would benefit from increased productivity and become a part of the e-business system by using the same software as their larger counterparts.

 ?We recognise that all customers, regardless of size, want a secure and reliable IT infrastructure to build and maintain their business,? he added.

 Oracle has also partnered with Dell, which has created a factory-installed bundle configured to meet the demand of the SME segment.

 The company has also created a strong network of independent software vendors (ISV), who develop software compliant with Oracle?s requirements.

 ?Pricing is important for SMEs,? said Dutta. ?We have 200 partners across the country with 2,20,000 members, who develop Oracle solutions.?

 Montek offers growth tips

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Dec. 6: Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia today said 3 per cent of GDP, amounting to Rs 100,000 crore annually, needed to be invested in infrastructure to stop the downslide in spending in this sector.

 There was a steady decline of public investment in infrastructure in the last 10 years, Ahluwalia said at the Administrative Staff College of India. Between 1992 and 2002, it had remained at only 2 per cent of the GDP, he added.

 Some efforts were made in the last two years to correct the situation and now there is an upswing, Ahluwalia said and added that most of his remarks might find place in the commissions approach paper for the Eleventh Plan.

 He pointed out that China had taken great strides in its investments in railways, which stood at $85 billion against $17 billion in India.

 He lamented that the subsidies in the power sector were not benefiting the end users. The sector, with accumulated losses of Rs 40,000 crore, is a major roadblock for the balance sheets of both the state and the Centre. The benefits are not trickling down and fiscal deficits are very high on account of this sector, he said. 

 According to Ahluwalia, reduction of T amp;D losses was the only way to revive the power sector, which could not meet its target of creating infrastructure. Although the private sector was expected to create 18000-mw capacity, they could achieve only 5000 mw, he said.

 A mid-term review by the Planning Commission has found that the key weakness of the power sector was in its poor distribution and it needed to reduce the T amp;D losses to less than 11 per cent, he said.

 He added that the commission was glad to note that the investment and performance of the telecom sector had exceeded the target.

 Ahluwalia said there was an urgent need to increase investment in social sectors comprising public health and education. We consider it worthy of double the spending in public health, which is currently only 0.9 per cent of the GDP.

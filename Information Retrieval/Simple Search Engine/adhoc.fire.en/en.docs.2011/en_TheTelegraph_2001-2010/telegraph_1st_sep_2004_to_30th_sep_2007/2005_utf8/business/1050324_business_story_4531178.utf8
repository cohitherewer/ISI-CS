 Matrix goes to China 

 - India 

 inc in a tearing hurry to go global 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 23: Matrix Laboratories will acquire a 60 per cent stake in MCHEM Pharma (Group) of China.

 In February, Matrix had announced a strategic alliance with the Chinese company. Matrix is now taking the deal forward and will conduct a due diligence exercise.

 ?The first MoU, which was signed on February 6, provides for a joint venture relationship between the two companies. The revised MoU will help Matrix acquire 60 per cent of the ownership interest in MCHEM Pharma Group and four other associate companies. 

 ?The amount to be paid for the acquisition will be in cash or in kind or a combination of both, subject to the detailed due diligence and all the requisite approvals,? Matrix told BSE.

 According to Matrix, the decision to enter China is part of an overall long-term strategy to become an end-to-end player and thus integrate both forward and backward. As part of this strategy, the company had acquired a finished dosage facility earlier this year in Nashik.

 ?Apart from emerging as a fully-integrated and cost-effective pharmaceutical player, the combined strengths of Matrix and MCHEM should provide an opportunity to meet the unmet needs of certain emerging markets, including China,? N. Prasad, chairman amp; CEO of Matrix, said today.

 MCHEM manufactures basic chemicals, intermediates, active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished dosage forms. The group is a major supplier of finished dosage forms of anti-AIDS products to the Chinese government.

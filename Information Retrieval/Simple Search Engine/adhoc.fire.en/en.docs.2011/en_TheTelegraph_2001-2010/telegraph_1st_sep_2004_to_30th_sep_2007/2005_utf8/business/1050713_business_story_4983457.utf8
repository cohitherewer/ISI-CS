 Quick gains in NDTV deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 12: An intriguing block deal in New Delhi Television Limited (NDTV) shares saw Rajiv Mehrotra of Shyam Cellular Infrastructure Projects selling an almost 8 per cent stake today to General Atlantic European Investments, a leading foreign institutional investor incorporated in Cyprus. 

 Mehrotras company had bought the 48 lakh shares in the media company on July 7 and made a cool profit in just five days. 

 But more than anything else, the deal also effectively shuts out the possibility of any foreign predator acquiring a stake in NDTV. Just last month, there were reports that a US media giant was looking at the possibility of picking up a stake in the Prannoy Roy-owned company. 

 That looks impossible now: NDTV already has a 3 per cent foreign shareholding. With Roy and wife Radhika, the promoters of the news channel, gifting a 15 per cent stake to daughter Tara ? a non-resident India ? the cumulative foreign shareholding in the company will touch 18.05 per cent. 

 If General Atlantics 8 per cent stake is added, then the government-mandated 26 per cent ceiling for foreign equity in media companies will be reached, say analysts. This would prevent a foreign investor from acquiring any further stake in NDTV. 

 The NDTV shares saw heightened action today, touching an intra-day high of Rs 267.90 before closing at Rs 258.90, a loss of Rs 1.35 paise over the previous days close of Rs 260.25. 

 The Mehrotras, through their dramatic trading in NDTV shares, would now have made a killing. Having bought the shares through the open market over the past fortnight, when the price was close to Rs 210, they would have sold the shares close to todays quotes. This gives them a profit of over Rs 20 crore. Their initial investment would have been roughly Rs 101 crore. 

 It is speculated that the owners of the premier channel were aware of the unwelcome interest among global media majors and, therefore, took pre-emptive action by gifting a 15 per cent stake to their daughter on her birthday, say market sources.

 This, however, could not be confirmed from NDTV directly.

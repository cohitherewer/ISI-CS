 Stocks defy oil, rupee buckles

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 30: The rupee sank to a nine-month low at 44.03 even as the sensex raced 111 points to 7745 on a day worries about high oil prices hung heavy on markets.

 A dash for dollars sent the Indian unit hurtling below the 44-mark in a foreign exchange market that just did not have enough greenbacks to go around. 

 The oil boil fuelled fears of a widening trade deficit, which could exert a downward pressure on the Indian currency.

 The rupee, which lost 15 paise over Monday, plumbed an intra-day low of 44.15. 

 Shyam Bakshi of Mecklai Financial said a plunge to 44.25 could not be ruled out.

 The stock markets defied the oil jitters to send the sensex to its intra-day high of 7758.36 before ending at 7745.00 against Mondays close of 7634.43, a jump of 110.57 points.

 Jaypee packs in power punch 

 New Delhi, Nov. 13 (PTI): The Jaypee group today said it would invest up to Rs 20,000 crore to develop hydro and thermal power projects by 2012 to emerge as one of the top three integrated power producers in the country.

 Manoj Gaur, managing director of Jaiprakash Associates Ltd, the groups flagship, said, We are also working towards restructuring of the groups businesses. All power investments in JP Associate will be put under a separate entity that could be the holding company for all our power sector ventures.

 We have commissioned Ernst amp; Young for the restructuring exercise and will take a decision by April next year, he added.

 The power sector, and especially hydro power, is going to be our main focus. In the power sector alone we have plans to invest about Rs 20,000 crore over the next five years to become a 5000-mw company from 300-mw now, Gaur said.

 Having successfully commissioned the 300-mw Baspa-II project, run by Jaypee Hydro Power Ltd that went public last year, the company has started working on the second project of 400-mw at Vishnu Prayag in Uttaranchal. This project will go on stream in March 2006, Gaur said.

 Besides this, the company has started pre-construction work at 1000-mw hydro power plant at Karcham Wangtoo in Himachal Pradesh. This project entails an investment of over Rs 5,400 crore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 AllBank maps out route to expansion

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 20: Allahabad Bank, poised for a second public offer, will step up its volume of retail loans and sell a variety of other products across its counters as part of a larger strategy to expand its business.

 The Calcutta-based bank is also going international with plans to open branches in Hong Kong and a joint venture with Punjab National Bank that will take it to Kazakhstan.

 In its draft prospectus for the forthcoming issue, the bank pointed out that it is keen to diversify its products and services, particularly in the area of retail loans. ?We sell third-party mutual funds and insurance policies. Although we do not hawk our own products, we might do so once we launch them in future,? the bank said. 

 In retail banking, Allahabad Bank?s strengths lie in its wide distribution, customer service and an array of products. It has entered into tie-ups with National Insurance Company and Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) to peddle their schemes to its own customers. Agreements with Export Credit and Guarantee Corporation and UTI Mutual Fund are in place too.

 The bank said it will issue 10 crore shares at a premium to be decided through the book-building process. This second offer will expand its capital base in a way that meets future requirements arising out of the implementation of the Basel II standards and the growth in assets ? primarily the loan and investment portfolios.

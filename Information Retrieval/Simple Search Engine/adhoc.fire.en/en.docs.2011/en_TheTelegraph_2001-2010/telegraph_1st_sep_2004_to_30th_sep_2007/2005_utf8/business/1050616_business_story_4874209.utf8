 Plan panel flashes inflation warning

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, June 15: The Centre today asked state governors to be ready for another oil shock that could spark an inflationary spiral and crimp growth.

 Plan panel deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia told governors at a meeting that rising global oil prices could lead to higher inflation rate.

 Officials added that the Planning Commission expects global oil prices to hover around $50 a barrel, despite reports of US stocks increasing and supplies from Opec countries swelling. But growing demand from China and India and political uncertainty in the oil-rich West Asia are factors that could put pressure on prices. 

 A report prepared by the Prime Ministers economic advisory council, headed by former RBI governor C. Rangarajan, has also warned that though prices typically drop in summer, this year such a trend has been weak. For several months, oil futures contracts are quoting above spot prices, indicating that markets expect high rates to persist. 

 Besides oil prices, an uncertain monsoon is a worry. Though the Centre has put on a brave face against contradictory reports on the monsoon, top officials said in case inflationary pressures were detected, the government would resort to open market sales and greater distribution of grain through the public distribution system.

 Reliance Info to tap rural areas

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 12: Reliance Infocomm plans to double its customer base every year and expects to have 2 million subscribers by the year-end.

 Chief operating officer K. P. Nanavaty said, ?With a teledensity of around 40 per cent in major metros, the growth potential lies in the rural areas, which currently have no connectivity or a teledensity of less than one. We will focus on tapping the potential in this area and expect to complete the network rollout in 5700 towns and 4 lakh villages by December.?

 Nanavaty also predicts a 500 per cent growth in the mobile subscriber base over the next three years.

 The company has also embarked on a customer relationship-building exercise with a retail chain of 1,160 WebWorldExpress (WWE) outlets across 110 cities. This will be supplemented by the existing 240 Web World stores across 110 cities.

 ?These shops will act as a one-stop shop for our wireless products, billing, customer care and information,? said Nanavaty. ?The retail outlets will be connected to the company?s network for instant co-ordination.?

 The company has invested between Rs 65 crore and Rs 70 crore to create a franchisee retail network and expects to generate indirect employment for around 8000 people. 

 Each outlet is expected to generate a revenue of around 1.5 lakh per month.

 Reliance Infocomm is also working on setting up a national network operations centre to centrally manage the customer care centres on the lines of the facility that monitors the company?s wireline and wireless business.

 ?The model for the centre is being worked out. We may also consider setting up hubs in major locations to facilitate faster response to the customer,? said Nanavaty.

 The funds for the new centre will be taken from the earlier declared corpus of Rs 24,000 crore.

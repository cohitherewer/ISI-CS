 Deal signed for Myanmar gas block

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi Oct. 4: ONGC Videsh Limited and GAIL (India) Ltd today signed an agreement with Daewoo of South Korea for a 30 per cent stake in the A-3 gas exploration block in Myanmar. While ONGC Videsh (OVL) will hold a 20 per cent stake, Gail will have 10 per cent. 

 The A-3 block is located near the A-1 block where the same consortium has already discovered around 4 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves. 

 Even though Daewoo won the bid for the A-3 block, the Korean firm will give a 30 per cent stake to the Indian companies on the persuasion of the government of Myanmar.

 Daewoo International chief H. B. Lee said during the drilling campaign from November 2004 until August this year, five appraisal wells from the Shwe field have resulted in one more discoveries of gas.

 Daewoo, which holds a 60 per cent per cent stake in the A-3 block, is engaged primarily in the hydrocarbon field. The shareholding in A-3 block is distributed on the same pattern as in the A-1 block in which Daewoo holds 60 per cent, OVL 20 per cent and GAIL and Kogas of Korea 10 per cent each.

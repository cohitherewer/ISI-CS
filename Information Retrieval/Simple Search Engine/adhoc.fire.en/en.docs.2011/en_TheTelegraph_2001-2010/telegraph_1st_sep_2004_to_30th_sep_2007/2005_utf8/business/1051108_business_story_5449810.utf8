 Bangalore, Nov. 7 (PTI): Mico, the countrys largest auto component manufacturer, has set a lower export target for the current year as the company is concentrating on the booming domestic market. 

 Mico, which is the Indian flagship of German power tools and household appliances maker Bosch, crossed a milestone today with the rollout of its 30 millionth PF pump.

 The company launched the first such pump in the country way back in 1954 and it has now grown into a Rs 100-crore business, with the agricultural sector accounting for 75 per cent of it, company officials told reporters today.

 According to Bangalore-based Mico, PF pumps, part of the fuel injection equipment, play a critical function of injecting a metered quantity of fuel, at a predetermined time and in a predetermined fashion.

 PF pumps find extensive application in auto-rickshaws, commercial three-wheelers, stationary engines, construction and agricultural machinery, ships and locomotives, Mico officials said.

 At present, Mico manufactures these pumps at its Bangalore and Naganathapura plants for its export markets, including the US, Germany, the UK, Italy and over 100 Indian overseas equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

 In 2004, Mico manufactured 16.58 lakh such pumps, with exports accounting for six lakh, officials said. 

 Mico clocked exports of Rs 400 crore in 2004, a 23 per cent year-on-year growth. 

 The company is confident of healthy bottomlines given the conformity of PF pumps to pollution norms in the years to come, said Micos joint managing director M. Lakshminarayan.

 Mico has manufacturing facilities in Bangalore, Nashik, Naganathapura (near Bangalore) and Jaipur. In the calendar year 2004, the overall sales of Bosch in India was Rs 3,000 crore. The Bosch group holds 60.55 per cent of Micos equity.

 Micos managing director Albert Hieronimus said the company was currently investing Rs 1,000 crore-plus for its expansion activities, including Rs 550 crore to Rs 600 crore for the common rail diesel injection system development.

 Hieronimus said Mico would start manufacturing common rail systems components from January next year, and the locally-manufactured system would roll out in 2007.

 British Gas jobs on way to India 

 London, July 15 (AP): British Gas plans to cut an estimated 2,000 jobs and shift 1,000 jobs to India, its spokesman said here today.

 We plan to cut about 2,000 jobs and outsource about 1,000 jobs to India, the spokesman said. The proposal is at a preliminary stage and the company is talking to the trade union, he added.

 He declined to give details on the outsourcing of jobs to India. The company said it is examining the change because a number of data processing and administrative jobs are likely to become redundant as it switches to a more streamlined customer billing system. However, the union said it would consider strike action over the issue.

 No one should be fooled that these savings will go towards reducing customers bills or improving services, said union spokesman Steve Bloomfield. 

 We will fight the management all the way to stop these office closures.

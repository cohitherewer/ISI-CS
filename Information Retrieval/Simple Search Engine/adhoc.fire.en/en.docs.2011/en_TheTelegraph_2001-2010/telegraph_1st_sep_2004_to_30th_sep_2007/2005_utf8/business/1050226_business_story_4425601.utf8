 Selloff target looks distant

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 25: The rather unambitious target of Rs 4000 crore for divestment in 2004-05 also seems distant given that only Rs 2765 crore has been achieved up to December 2004 ? and there is no sign of any new public issue by state-owned companies in the last three months of the year.

 Compare this with the divestment target of Rs 14,500 crore by the government in 2003-04 and the achievement of Rs 15,547 crore during that period, says the Economic Survey 2004-05 tabled in Parliament today.

 The United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government has had to be careful not to hurt the Left while pushing for the selloff of its stake in the PSUs.

 The survey reiterates the commitment made in the common minimum programme on the issue. It says, ?Profit-making companies will not be privatised; the new policy spells out that all privatisations will be considered on a transparent and consultative case-by-case basis.?

 While the government is committed to retain existing navratna companies in the public sector, it will also encourage these firms to raise money from the capital market.

 However, it is the chronically loss-making companies which will be either sold off or closed. But every effort will be made to revive sick industry and re-structure sick public sector companies, the survey says.

 The government has decided to establish a board for reconstruction of public sector enterprises (BRPSE) to advise the government on ways and means to strengthen public sector enterprises.

 The government has approved the constitution of a national investment fund comprising proceeds from divestment of PSUs to make investments in social sector projects. The proceeds will also be used to selected profitable or revivable PSEs.

 The government has also given an in-principle approval for listing currently unlisted profitable PSEs each with a net worth in excess of Rs 200 crore through an initial public offering (IPO). 

 Such an IPO will be either in conjunction with a fresh equity issue by the PSE concerned or independently by the government on a case-by-case basis.

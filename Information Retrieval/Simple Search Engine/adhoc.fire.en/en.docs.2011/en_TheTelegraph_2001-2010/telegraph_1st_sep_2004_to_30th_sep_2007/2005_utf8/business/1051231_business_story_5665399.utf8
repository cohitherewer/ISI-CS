 Maxis-Apollo walks the talk on Aircel deal

 OUR BUREAU/AGENCIES

 Dec. 30: Maxis Communications Bhd, Malaysia?s biggest cellphone firm, along with its joint venture partner, the Apollo Group, will acquire mobile operator Aircel for $1.08 billion.

 Maxis will take a direct 65 per cent stake in Aircel by picking up new and existing shares for $702 million. It will hold the remaining 35 per cent stake indirectly through the joint venture, in turn owned 74 per cent by Apollo and 26 per cent by Maxis.

 The stake ratio in the joint venture will give Maxis an overall equity of 74 per cent in Aircel, the maximum allowed under foreign-ownership rules. 

 Aircel has 2.2 million users and a third of the market in Tamil Nadu and Chennai, Maxis said. Aircel has licences to provide services in 12 out of 23 circles in the country. 

 Maxis, which is looking for overseas growth as its Malaysian market matures, said Aircel would be a springboard into the Indian market, giving it access to 628 million people, or 58 per cent of the country?s population, by the end of 2006.

 ?We don?t fall in love at first sight. We saw a lot of people before deciding on Aircel,? Maxis chief executive Jamaludin Ibrahim told reporters after announcing the deal in Kuala Lumpur.

 Sunita Reddy of the Apollo Group said the partnership with Maxis would be a ?perfect fit in our endeavour to grow the telecommunications market?.

 Aircel is controlled by C. Sivasankaran?s Sterling Infotech group.

 Of the $1.08 billion investment for a 100 per cent stake in Aircel, $280 million will be injected into the company as cash, said Megat Zaharadduin, Maxis chairman.

 Maxis said it planned to list Aircel to recoup some of its investment, but gave no time-frame.

 Maxis said the Aircel deal would start contributing to its net profit in three to four years and would not derail its dividend policy of paying up to 65 per cent of net profit for 2005.

 Friday?s deal follows several attempts by Sterling Infotech to sell a stake in Aircel.

 Others in the fray included Hutchison Telecommunications International Ltd and Russian conglomerate AFK Sistema. The Hutchison deal, announced in 2004, failed to receive regulatory approval within the required deadline. Later, the Sistema deal stalled over financing difficulties.

 The new joint venture company will have five directors representing the Apollo Group and four representing Maxis.

 Maxis has more than 6.5 million subscribers and is engaged in a price war at home for new customers, a market where two thirds of the population already have a mobile phone.

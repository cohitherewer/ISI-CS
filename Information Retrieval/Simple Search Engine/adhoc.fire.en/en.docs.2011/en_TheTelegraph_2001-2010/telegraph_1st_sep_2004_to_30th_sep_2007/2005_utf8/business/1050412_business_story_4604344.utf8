 ICICI Venture in pact with Tishman 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 11: ICICI Venture Funds Management Company today joined hands with the US-based Tishman Speyer Properties (TSP) to develop real estate projects in the country.

 The new company will pursue ?ground-up? development of office, residential and retail properties in the country. The joint venture is the first in the country involving a major US real estate development company. 

 TSP and ICICI Venture will each own 50 per cent of the joint venture company and will equally share the investments made in projects. Real estate projects approved for foreign direct investment will be developed through the new joint venture. 

 The joint venture is currently evaluating sites in various cities, including Mumbai and Bangalore.

 Katherine Farley, senior managing director at TSP, who is responsible for the firm?s activity in emerging markets, will oversee TSP?s involvement in the joint venture.

 TSP is a developer and manager of real estate across the world. Some of its properties are New York Citys Chrysler Building and Rockefeller Center.

 Meanwhile, ICICI Venture has launched a real estate fund ? India Advantage Fund III ? with a corpus of $250 million.

 The first closing of $200 million would occur this month from a number of institutional investors and high net worth individuals and is expected to raise over $300 million by the final closing.

 The focus of the fund would be develop, acquire, lease and sell office buildings, residential premises and retail spaces, and would also diversify and invest in projects in growing Indian cities.

 The investment would be up to 25 per cent of the total capital in a single metro area and not more than 15 per cent of the total capital in a single project.

 The fund would also look for value-buying in tier-II cities like Mysore, Ahmedabad, Vizag and Jaipur.

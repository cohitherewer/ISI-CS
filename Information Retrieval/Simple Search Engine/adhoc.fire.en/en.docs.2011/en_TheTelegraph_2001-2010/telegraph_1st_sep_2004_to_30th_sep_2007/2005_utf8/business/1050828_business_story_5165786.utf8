 Chennai, Aug. 27 (PTI): Laying stress on lending to small and medium enterprises (SMEs), Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) and the Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) today signed a memorandum of understanding for co-financing the SME projects.

 Under the agreement, term loan for viable SME projects will be financed by Sidbi, while IOB will lend the working capital. 

 Initially, the scheme will be implemented at select clusters in Chennai, Erode, Tiruchi and Madurai and will later be extended to other places.

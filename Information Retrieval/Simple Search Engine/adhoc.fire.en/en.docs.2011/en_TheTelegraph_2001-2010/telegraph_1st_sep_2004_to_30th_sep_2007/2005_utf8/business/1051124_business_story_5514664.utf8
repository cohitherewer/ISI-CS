 Calcutta, Nov. 23: The commercial taxes department of the Bengal government has formed a 12-member VAT Amendment Cell to give specific suggestions on improving the procedures and simplifying the system of indirect taxation.

 The cell has sought various trade bodies opinion on this subject by December 31. 

 The cell will send its recommendations to the state government by January 31. Finally, the empowered committee of state ministers on VAT will discuss these suggestions.

 The simplification will not only help traders but will also benefit the department, C.M. Bachhawat, commercial taxes commissioner of the state, said.

 There has been a healthy growth in revenue collection in the first six months after VAT was introduced from April 1, Bachhawat said at a meeting organised by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce today. 

 We have been able to plug the leak in the new system, which has led to this growth even as there are sharp reductions in tax rates in many items, he added without divulging the exact figures.

 However, sources said it would be a double-digit growth for Bengal even after factoring in reduction in collection from high yielding commodities like cement and cooking gas. 

 The new regime also saw registration going up by 25,000 in Bengal, indicating a wider compliance in the regime.

 However, there is more scope for better compliance, especially in cash memo sales, he said, adding that the department was chalking out plans to plug the loopholes in this regard.

 The department will also try to simplify applications for registrations for re-sellers and works contracts.

 He urged the traders for timely filing of returns so that refunds could be made on time.

 Matrix snaps up Chinese firm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Sept. 26: Matrix Laboratories is on a buying binge. Within a week of acquiring a 43 per cent stake in Swiss firm Explora Laboratories, the company has scooped up a controlling 60 per cent stake in the Mchem group of China for an undisclosed sum.

 The acquisition will help Matrix leverage the comparative advantage that China provides in sourcing pharmaceutical chemicals and intermediates. The Hyderabad-based drug firm will also get a new market for its anti-AIDS drugs. Matrix today said it has entered into a share-purchase agreement with promoters of the Mchem group.

 The transaction, likely to be completed before December, is subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions and regulatory approvals, it added.

 The share-purchase agreement is in line with the memorandum of understanding that Matrix had earlier signed with Mchem for access to Chinese chemicals and intermediates so that it can establish a cost-effective supply chain. The Chinese pharmaceutical market is also growing at a rapid pace.

 The acquisition of a substantial stake in the Mchem group is a strategic step towards strengthening our supply chain and to emerge as a cost-effective manufacturer. With absolutely no overlap of products, customers and markets, Matrix would further strengthen its presence in global markets, said N. Prasad, executive chairman of Matrix.

 The acquisition will help Matrix achieve backward integration in China for manufacture of intermediates. It will also help it consolidate its position as a supplier of active pharmaceutical ingredients.

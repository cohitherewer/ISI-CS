 Oil team to explore China tie-ups

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 5: A team of ONGC, Indian Oil and Gail officials led by Talmiz Ahmed, additional secretary (international co-operation), will leave for China on Sunday to explore opportunities for closer co-operation between the two Asian giants. The two countries are among the biggest importers of oil with a fast- growing demand for energy to fuel their emerging economies. 

 The national oil companies of both countries are also on the look out for acquiring foreign oil and gas fields in an attempt to strengthen their energy security. 

 However, more often than not, Chinese and Indian companies end up competing with each other for the same assets. In the process, the winner ends up paying a higher price. 

 The task force set up by petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar will look for ways of reducing this competition. Ahmed said the areas of common interest include the Caspian region, Africa and Latin America.

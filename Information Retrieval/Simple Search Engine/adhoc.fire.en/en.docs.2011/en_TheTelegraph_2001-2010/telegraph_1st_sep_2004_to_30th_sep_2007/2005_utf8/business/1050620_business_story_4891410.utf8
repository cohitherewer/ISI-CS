 Q amp;A

 In your interest

 Is it true that on maturity of NSC, one has to pay capital gains tax on the interest amount. In such a case, how is this tax calculated using the Cost Inflation Index? Also, if the same amount is reinvested in another NSC or any other eligible scheme, does it still attract the tax?

 Suranjan Chaudhuri, by e-mail

 There is no capital gains tax on the interest amount of NSC. On the contrary, till last financial year, the accrued interest was eligible for deduction under section 80L, which has been abolished from the current year. However, the accrued interest is still considered as further investment in the scheme and continues to be eligible for deduction under the new section 80C.

 Not a senior yet

 I am 58 years old and have just retired as this is the retirement age of our company. Am I eligible to save under the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme? I have heard that people who are 55 years and above and have opted for VRS are eligible under the scheme.

 Soumyendra Nath Dutt, Calcutta 

 You are not yet eligible to invest in the scheme, as although you retired at the age of 58 years, it was not through VRS. You will have to wait till you are 60 years.

 Stranded in the middle

 I stayed in the UK for a year in 2004 on work permit. I had a bank account there, where my remuneration used to get transferred. I did not transfer the savings to my Indian account while leaving the country then. At present, I am in the UK on a business visa. Can I now transfer the amount in my UK account to the Indian one? Will there be any tax liability if I do so (as I had already paid tax on them while I was working here)? As a proof, I have the past bank statements sent by the bank to my residential address in India.

 Animesh Guha, by e-mail

 You can transfer the amount to your Indian account. As for the tax liability, we need to know your residential status for the financial years 2003-2004 and 2004-05. Assuming that you were an NRI for that period, the income earned by you for services in the UK would not be taxable in India if your employment contract was with a foriegn company. In case your contract was with an Indian company then such income would have been taxable in India.

 Panel favours close vigil on FIIs

 Lahiri: Keeping a watch

 New Delhi, Dec. 5 (PTI): Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are welcome, but inflow of bad money into the Indian capital market through the FII route, especially from lesser known tax havens, are not, according to an expert panel that submitted its report to the finance ministry today.

 The panel, headed by chief economic adviser Ashok Lahiri, said, It must be ensured that only clean money through recognised banking channels is permitted in the securities market.

 There should be a negative list of tax havens, whereby entities registered in these jurisdictions are prevented from attaining the FII status, it said in a report titled Encouraging FII flows and checking the vulnerability of capital markets to speculative flow.

 It fears that inflow of funds through unrecognised banking channels into the securities market could be laundered money. It, therefore, said the norms on participatory notes issued by FIIs should continue and Sebi should have full powers to obtain information regarding the final holder and beneficiaries or of any holder at any point of time in case of any investigation or surveillance action.

 Though FII investment in India has shown a phenomenal growth at about $9.2 billion, it said non-availability of good quality equities in adequate volume appears to be impeding FII flows. FII flows will be encouraged by greater volume of issuance of securities in the Indian market. This would be assisted by PSU divestment, it said. 

 The Lahiri panel also pitched for allowing domestic pension funds in equity market, which would augment the diversity of views on the market.

 This would also end the anomaly of the existing situation where foreign pension funds are extensive users of Indian equity market but domestic pension funds are not, it said.

 Regarding the ceiling on FII and sub-accounts, the panel said, The existing limit of 10 per cent holding in any one firm by one FII may be extended to cover the sum of the holdings of any one FII and all such sub-accounts coming under that FII, which have common beneficial ownership as the FII.

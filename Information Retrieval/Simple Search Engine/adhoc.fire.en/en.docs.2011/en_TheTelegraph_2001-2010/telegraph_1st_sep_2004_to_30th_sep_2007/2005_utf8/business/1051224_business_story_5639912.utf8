 Hilfiger in Apax wardrobe

 NEW DRESS CODE

 New York, Dec. 23 (Reuters): Clothing seller and designer Tommy Hilfiger Corp said on Friday that it agreed to be bought by private equity firm Apax Partners for $16.80 per share in cash, in a transaction valued at about $1.6 billion.

 Tommy Hilfiger had put itself up for sale, having struggled with its United States wholesale business.

 Shares of the company rose 1 per cent, or 15 cents, to $16.15 in pre-market trade. 

 Analysts and investors had earlier thought the company could fetch more than $20 a share.

 The company?s founder, Tommy Hilfiger, has agreed with Apax to enter into a new employment agreement in which he will continue as principal designer as well as chairman of the strategy and design board.

 The chief executive, David Dyer, will leave, and Fred Gehring, chief executive of Tommy Hilfiger Europe, will take over as the chief executive officer.

 The transaction is expected to close in spring 2006 and is subject to shareholder approval.

 JP Morgan Securities Inc acted as Tommy Hilfiger Corp?s financial adviser for the deal.

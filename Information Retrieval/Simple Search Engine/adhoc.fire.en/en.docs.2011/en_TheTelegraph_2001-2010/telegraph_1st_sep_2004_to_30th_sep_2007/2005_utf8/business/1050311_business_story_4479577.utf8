 Glenmark pops TASC pill in reverse merger

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Two in one

 Mumbai, March 10: Glenmark Laboratories will merge with TASC Pharmaceuticals to form an integrated company, which will have a presence in the entire value chain. The deal is valued at Rs 1,200 crore.

 Glenmark is into formulations, while TASC?s forte is active pharmaceutical ingredients or bulk drugs necessary to make formulations. Reports of a reverse merger between the two companies have been doing the rounds over the past few days.

 Under the deal, shareholders of Glenmark will get 1.8 shares of TASC for every share held. The ratio was decided based on valuation of Glenmark by Deloitte Hasking amp; Sells (DHS). DHS has valued Glenmark at Rs 750 crore. The valuation of the combined entity has been put at Rs 1200 crore, which includes the market capitalisation of TASC Pharma.

 Apart from the promoters, led by managing director Mark Saldanha, UTI Venture Fund, Spring Hill Bio Venture and Asia Prise Biotech hold stakes in Glenmark. 

 Post-alignment, promoters? holding in TASC Pharma will stand at 63 per cent. Of this, 53.5 per cent will be of Glenmark?s, while the remaining will be with TASC Pharma managing director Vijay Thakkar. 

 The share capital of the new entity will be Rs 35.40 crore. While the public will hold 22 per cent, institutional investors will have 15 per cent.

 Saldanha told The Telegraph that TASC Pharma was chosen as it was a perfect mix with Glenmark?s operations. 

 This, he added, is crucial considering the fact that in a product patent regime, domestic pharmaceutical companies are looking to strengthen their entire value chain. 

 The amalgamation would mean a backward integration for Glenmark and a forward integration for the TASC. The merger would result in an entity that will have vertically integrated operations.

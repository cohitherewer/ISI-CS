 Panel favours costlier export loans

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Dear dollar

 Mumbai, June 13: A Reserve Bank (RBI) group has recommended that interest rates on export credit offered in foreign currency should be raised 25 basis points to at least 100-200 basis points over London Inter-bank Offered Rate (Libor). It did not suggest any change in rupee loans given to small and medium-sized exporters.

 The panel also asked authorities to look at imposing a limit up to which banks may be allowed to borrow abroad. Many of them raise overseas loans to finance export credit.

 The suggestion to raise interest rates on export credit in foreign currency has been made to restrain banks from levying charges above the ceiling set by the central bank. It follows revelations that some banks were levying service charges of up to 2 per cent of the amount of export credit in foreign currency in addition to the interest rate ceiling prescribed by the Reserve Bank.

 For export credit in foreign currency, the interest rates may be raised 25 basis points, (Libor+1 percentage point for the first slab and 2 percentage point for the second slab). However, banks will not levy any other charges in any manner except for recovery of out-of-pocket expenses that may have been incurred, the panel said. 

 The group observed that though there has been a substantial increase in the volume of forex export credit over the past three years, there was demand for more.

 In view of their limited foreign exchange resources, the RBI has allowed banks untrammelled access to foreign funds that can later be lent to exporters. Most of the banks have availed of this facility. 

 While some banks were extending export credit in foreign currency entirely out of their deposits, others were doing so by borrowing abroad. A few of them use a combination of deposits and loans raised in the foreign market. 

 Since overseas cash was the biggest source, the group felt there was a need to set a limit on this pool. The committee was set up in April under the chairmanship of Anand Sinha, the chief general manager who oversees the department of banking operations and development at the Reserve Bank. Representatives of SBI, Canara Bank, Federal Bank, Federation of Indian Exporters Organisation and Engineering Export Promotion Council were part of the group.

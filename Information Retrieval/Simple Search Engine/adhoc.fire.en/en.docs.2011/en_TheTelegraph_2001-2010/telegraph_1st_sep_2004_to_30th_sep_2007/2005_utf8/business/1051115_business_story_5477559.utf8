 FIIs rush to buy sticky assets

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Nov. 14: Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) like JP Morgan, Lehman Brothers, Newbridge Capital, and Clearwater Capital have approached Asset Reconstruction Company (India) Limited (Arcil) for investing in security receipts issued by the company against sticky assets.

 Talking to The Telegraph, Arcil president and chief operating officer S. Khasnobis said, Following the governments decision to allow FIIs to invest in security receipts, many foreign funds have approached us. A number of Hong Kong and Singapore-based funds are also keen to invest in Arcils security receipts.

 Arcil wanted FIIs to be allowed to buy non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans. While it is common in foreign countries to buy bad loans from asset reconstruction companies, the FIIs operating in India are not allowed to do so. Arcil had made a representation to regulatory agencies like Sebi and the Reserve Bank of India for permission. 

 The FIIs have been investing in international markets in what is called junk bonds, which are equivalent to security receipts issued by asset reconstruction companies in India. These receipts represent the assets of the sick company, Khasnobis said.

 Security receipts represent the undivided rights, title and interest of the investor in financial assets held by the asset reconstruction company. The security receipts are redeemed only out of realisation from the financial assets held under the asset reconstruction company and carry no returns.

 The Arcil president said security receipts can also be sold in the secondary markets, which makes them an attractive window for investment by the FIIs. 

 In the absence of FIIs, it was mainly some of the banks and FIs ? which sold these bad loans to Arcil in the first place ? which are buying the security receipts. However, the number of such banks or FIs is small.

 Till date, Arcil has issued security receipts worth Rs 4062 crore. 

 There had been talks that ICICI Bank, a major promoter of Arcil, might offload a 10 per cent stake in Arcil. ICICI Bank holds a 29.5 per cent stake in Arcil. The other two major promoters of Arcil are the State Bank of India and the Industrial Development Bank of India. Each of them holds a 19.5 per cent stake in Arcil.

 A proper valuation of ICICI Banks stake in Arcil will be carried out. It will take another three months to set the ball rolling, Khasnobis said. The equity capital of Arcil is Rs 100 crore now.

 Bankers feel that the eagerness of the FIIs to buy out the security receipts will help the Indian banking industry, which is saddled with high gross non-performing assets.

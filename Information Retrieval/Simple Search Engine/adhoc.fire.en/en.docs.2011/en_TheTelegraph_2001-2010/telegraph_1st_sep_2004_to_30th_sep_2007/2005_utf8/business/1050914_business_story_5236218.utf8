 New Delhi, Sept. 13: Finance minister P. Chidambaram plans to bring a Rs 15,000-crore cooperative bank revamp package before the cabinet by October-end.

 Chidambaram also forecast better farm output this year, asserting this year, the area of sowing for all crops is higher than last year.

 The minister said the government is likely to pay Rs 8,000 crore for the revamp, while state governments and cooperatives will raise the remaining money. 

 I think we got a near consensus. I hope that all states will agree. The Centre will do its part, but states and cooperatives will have to bear a small burden too, he said at function organised by Nabard.

 Unless agriculture grows at over 3 per cent or close to 4 per cent, it will not be possible to go beyond 7 per cent growth, he told reporters on the sidelines of the function. Last year, farm output grew just 1.1 per cent due to scanty rains. 

 While most parts of the country had good monsoon rains this year, scanty rain in western India and floods in Maharashtra and Karnataka caused severe damage to crops. Although farming accounts for only a fifth of the nations GDP, it employs the largest numbers. This means poor farm profits hit jobs. 

 The government is working overtime on building a network of irrigation facilities in the countryside and overhauling rural credit. 

 The minister pointed out that cooperative banks may not be able to pay the 16 per cent contribution that an expert committee had felt they should chip in with.

 He said the Centre or states would have to fork out this sum, while cooperatives have to foot a small portion of the bill. The government has circulated a draft for the financial package among states, which will have to send their responses within three to six weeks. 

 The consensus package will then be taken up for cabinet approval. We hope to get the clearance by October 31, Chidambaram said. 

 The finance ministry had convened a meeting of chief ministers, chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, last week to discuss the revamp package.

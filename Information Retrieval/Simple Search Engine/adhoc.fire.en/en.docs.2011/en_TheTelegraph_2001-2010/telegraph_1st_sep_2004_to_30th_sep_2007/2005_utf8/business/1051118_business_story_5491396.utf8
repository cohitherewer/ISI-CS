 Chidambaram: Close watch

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: The cabinet today decided to refer the proposal to liberalise foreign direct investment (FDI) in airports, mineral exploration and power trading to a group of ministers (GoM).

 The GoM, which is yet to be constituted, will suggest ways to bring ?more precision on formulation?, Union finance minister P. Chidambaram said after a meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA).

 The minister said he did not expect this to take time and the proposal would soon come up before the CCEA. The original cabinet proposal prepared by the department of industrial policy and promotion had also suggested allowing resident Indians to transfer shares to their non-resident counterparts through the automatic route and not wait for clearances from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board.

 The note had recommended 100 per cent FDI in power trading, a sector still closed to foreign investment, and in coal mining by cement and steel companies. It had also proposed 100 per cent foreign investment in greenfield airports through the automatic route.

 It also suggested doing away with mandatory divestment, applicable to foreign companies, in favour of Indian firms in sectors like tea and business-to-business e-commerce and placing foreign investment in wholesale trading on the automatic route.

 The CCEA today approved a proposal from the coal ministry to foreclose the Jhanjra underground project of the Eastern Coalfields near Raniganj in Bengal. The foreclosure was approved because of a decline in returns and poor labour productivity.

 ?A series of factors had affected this project. Labour productivity had declined from over three tonnes to one tonne, the returns from about 11 per cent to 6 per cent as well as poor financial planning and problems in land acquisition,? Chidambaram said after the meeting chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 The project was earlier approved for a production capacity of 2 million tonnes per year and had a capital investment of Rs 363.07 crore. The project had produced 1.03 million tonnes per annum of grade C coal. The CCEA also approved the implementation of ?deepening of channel at Paradip Port? project, which requires an estimated cost of Rs 154.84 crore as on June 2005.

 The government will provide a grant of Rs 51.61 crore ? one-third of the project cost ? and the same amount as loan. The balance amount will be arranged by the Paradip Port Trust. 

 FM radio

 The government today notified 20 per cent FDI in FM radio, weeks after inviting bids for the second phase of expansion.

 Retail reality

 The government appears to be toying with the idea of permitting FDI in the retail sector from companies which will also set up food processing facilities and cold chains to preserve fruits and vegetables.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath said around 40 per cent of the fruits and vegetables produced in the country rot because of lack of proper food packaging and cold storage facilities.

 Credit Suisse beats forecast

 Loan ranger 

 Zurich, May 4 (Reuters): Credit Suisse beat forecasts with a rise in quarterly profit as strong earnings at its flagship private bank outweighed mixed investment banking results, boosting its shares. 

 Net profit at Europe?s ninth-largest bank came in at 1.910 billion Swiss francs ($1.59 billion), up 2.6 per cent from the year-ago quarter. 

 Credit Suisse said it saw market conditions improving in the second half of the year after a dip in the second quarter, striking a positive note compared to rival UBS, which on Tuesday voiced caution over its full-year outlook. 

 ?Credit Suisse Group expects to see market activity slow considerably in the second quarter. However, the group expects market conditions to improve in the second half of 2005,? it said in a statement on Wednesday. 

 The bank declined to say what the tepid start to the second quarter would mean for full-year results. ?We don?t give any indication of the full-year outlook,? chief financial officer Renato Fassbind said in a conference call with journalists. 

 But analysts focused on a solid showing in the bank?s flagship private bank, an improvement in the investment bank from a weak fourth quarter, and the group?s outlook for the year ahead ? which some had feared could be worse. 

 ?Overall the figures look very good. The outlook is probably upbeat in comparison to UBS, given the prospect of happier times in the second half,? said Peter Thorne at brokerage Helvea. 

 Credit Suisse shares were up 0.7 per cent at 50.65 francs, having touched 51.15 earlier, outperforming the DJ Stoxx European banks index which had added 0.4 per cent by that time. 

 ?These results should provide some tailwind for our ?buy? rating,? analyst Dirk Becker at Kepler Equities said in a note. 

 Credit Suisse?s flagship private banking unit ? where it manages wealthy clients? money ? matched the year-ago result with a net income of 685 million, but was up 11 per cent on the quarter. 

 Credit Suisse said it saw overall net new money inflows of 15.4 billion francs in the quarter, just under the 15.6 billion in the year-earlier period, but up from 3.5 billion in the last three months of 2004. Its private banking unit alone generated 7.0 billion francs in net inflows during the quarter, it said.

 Suitors mull Unocal split to skirt bidding

 Crossroads: Unocal headquarters in California

 Singapore, July 4 (Reuters): As the battle between Chinas CNOOC Ltd and Chevron Corp to buy Unocal drags on, speculation is emerging that they may eventually agree to carve up the US producer. 

 By splitting up some of Unocals assets, such as stakes in its Indonesian natural gas fields, CNOOC and Chevron can avoid a bidding war that could make Unocal too expensive for either of the bidders, some observers say. 

 If Chevron at some stage feels it may be pulled into an expensive and drawn-out bidding war, it may find merit in the idea of selling CNOOC part of Unocals Thai natural gas assets or all of Unocals gas assets in politically-sensitive Myanmar, according to this line of thinking. 

 The Unocal assets in Myanmar, Indonesia and Thailand are collectively valued by Deutsche Bank at more than $6 billion. Most analysts see these as core assets that would be of interest to CNOOC. 

 Separate from the Unocal assets, Chevron could also sell CNOOC part of its stake in the giant Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Australia for a favourable price, analysts say. 

 When both parties find it is becoming too costly to acquire Unocal, they will probably talk to each other, said Lawrence Lau, an analyst at Beijing-backed brokerage BOCI in Hong Kong. 

 But analysts stress this is just a possible scenario that could emerge at the end of a Unocal acquisition saga. If either side pulls ahead as a clear potential victor, a compromise would not be necessary. 

 Currently, neither Chevron nor its Chinese rival is likely to initiate such ideas, analysts say. If either of the bidders proposed it now, that would weaken their negotiating positions, which are at a delicate stage. 

 Both Chevron and state-run CNOOC are going all-out to persuade Unocal shareholders to accept their bids. 

 At the moment, they are not going to do anything to change what is on the table, said a senior investment banker at a global bank in Asia, which is not involved in any discussions about the Unocal deal. 

 CNOOC is scrambling to convince Unocal shareholders that its $18.5 billion, all-cash bid is superior to Chevrons stock-and-cash offer, now valued about 10 per cent below CNOOCs, despite the risks or possible delays associated with obtaining US approvals. 

 CNOOC is also seeking to assure Unocal shareholders that a CNOOC-Unocal tie-up eventually will be approved, asserting a deal would not hurt US energy security because Unocals assets account for a tiny fraction of US production.

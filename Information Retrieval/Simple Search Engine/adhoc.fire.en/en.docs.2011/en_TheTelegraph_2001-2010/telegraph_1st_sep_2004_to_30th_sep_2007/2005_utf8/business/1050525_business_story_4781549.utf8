 Buffett powers ahead with PacifiCorp buy 

 Buffett: Marching ahead

 London, May 24 (Reuters): Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has agreed to buy US electricity firm PacifiCorp for $9.4 billion, including debt from utility Scottish Power, which also announced the unit had missed its earnings target.

 UK-based Scottish Power said today that it was selling PacifiCorp to MidAmerican Energy, a Des Moines, Iowa-based unit of Buffetts Berkshire Hathaway. 

 Scottish Power added it would return around $4.5 billion of the proceeds to its shareholders. 

 MidAmerican, which already owns British utility CE Electric UK and had once been tipped as a potential bidder for Scottish Power, agreed to pay $5.1 billion in cash plus approximately $4.3 billion in net debt and preferred stock. 

 ?We are excited to be making this long-term investment, through MidAmerican, in the premier energy company in the West. PacifiCorp is a great company with outstanding assets,? Buffett said in a statement. 

 Shares in Scottish Power, Britains second-biggest electricity stock, rose as much as 8.5 per cent to an intra-day high of 479-3/4 pence, its highest price since September 2001.

 The stock later pared those gains to trade up 6.1 per cent at 468-3/4 pence by 0900 GMT, as some analysts said Scottish Power could have sold PacifiCorp for more money.

 ING analyst Fraser McLaren said investors would welcome the sale of PacifiCorp. 

 ?We believe the market will react positively to this news which brings to an end the persistent uncertainty regarding PacifiCorp,? he said in a research note.

 Williams de Broe analyst Angelos Anastasiou cut his rating on Scottish Power to ?hold? from ?buy?.

 Scottish Power shares have outperformed the DJ Stoxx European utility sector by about 8 per cent since the start of 2005.

 The utilities sector has always been an attractive one for predatory investors, as companies in the sector are profitable and have strong cash flows. 

 Scottish Power bought PacifiCorp in 1999 for around $10 billion, and the British company said the sale would lead to an impairment charge of ?927 million ($1.7 billion). 

 The US electricity producer accounted for about 50 per cent of overall earnings but it has recently suffered from bad weather and plant outages.

 Scottish Power today said PacifiCorp had operating profit before goodwill amortization and exceptional items for the year to March 31, 2005 of $914 million. Its target had been $1 billion.

 The company decided it was better to sell PacifiCorp than continue investing in the business to improve returns.

 ?This was proving to be a difficult year for PacifiCorp,? Scottish Power Chief Executive Ian Russell said, adding that the sale was not expected to lead to job cuts.

 Scottish Power also reported that pretax profit before goodwill and exceptional items for the year ending March 31 rose 10 per cent to 1.015 billion pounds, the first time the company had made a billion-pound profit. 

 Earnings per share (EPS) rose 10 per cent to 40.22 pence, ahead of market forecasts, and the total dividend rose 10 per cent to 22.50 pence.

 CEO Russell said the sale of PacifiCorp could take between 12 and 18 months to complete, and added it was too early to say how Scottish Power would return the proceeds of the sale to investors. 

 PacifiCorp was originally meant to have been a key driver of earnings growth for Scottish Power. 

 Russell said once the company had disposed of the division, around 70 per cent of its earnings would come from its infrastructure division, which owns and manages British power networks. 

 Investment banks UBS and Morgan Stanley advised Scottish Power on the PacifiCorp sale. Houlihan Lokey Howard amp; Zukin advised MidAmerican.

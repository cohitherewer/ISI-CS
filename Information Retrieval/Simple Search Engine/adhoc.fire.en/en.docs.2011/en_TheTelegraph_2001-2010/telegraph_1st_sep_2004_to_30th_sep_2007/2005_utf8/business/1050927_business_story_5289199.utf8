 Barons to fly different routes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 A Mouthful of sky

 Mumbai, Sept. 26: Liquor baron-turned airline promoter Vijay Mallya and Jeh Wadia, the young scion of the Wadia family, will square off for battle in a month?s time.

 Mallya?s Kingfisher Airlines and Wadia?s GoAir ? which will take to the skies on October 30 ? will hope to lure potential travellers to their airlines.

 Quiz them on their strategies and the type of customers they are targeting and you find their airlines are as different as chalk and cheese.

 Wadia talks about ?commoditising air travel?, rather like Air Deccan?s G.R. Gopinath, who pioneered the concept of low-cost no-frills airline in India.

 Mallya, however, is looking at the upper-end traveller who values the flying experience and likes being cosseted.

 Kingfisher is spreading its wings and is beginning to ramp up operations by adding new routes and airplanes. Wadia is planning to start his ticket sales from October 6. 

 The Indian civil aviation sector is touted as the fastest growing sectors in the world with a 25 per cent growth expected annually over the next five years.

 ?What are you talking about?? recoils Mallya in mock horror when someone clubs Kingfisher as a low-cost airline. Kingfisher has just one class of travel and that is why it creates that impression unlike Indian Airlines and Jet which offer business and economy seating. ?I believe in the Jet model,? says Mallya. ?Kingfisher is competing in that space.?

 Smoking his trademark Henri Winterman Cafe Creme cigar which is dutifully lighted by a waiter who mysteriously appears when he pulls out the cigar tin case from his coat pocket, Mallya asks ?Who?s buying the Hyundai Sonatas, the Optras, the Toyota Corollas? Mercedes cars have a waiting period of six months in India.?

 ?I started my career with a Rs 400 per month stipend whereas a young school kid could get minimum Rs 4000 per month now,? he says. ?Times have changed.?

 ?We are very clear. Our passengers will come from the SEC A amp; B categories and not the C amp; D category that Jeh is targeting.? Jeh Wadia was at the Open Skies summit here in Mumbai, but out of earshot. Not that he would have minded. 

 Wadia comes from a family that built ships more than a century ago and Bombay Burmah, a group company that was the second company to be listed in the 127 year old BSE Ltd. GoAir, is his biggest shot at entrepreneurship. 

 He proudly states that the American anthem was penned on one of the ships built by his ancestors.

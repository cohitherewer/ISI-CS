 Move to boost telecom gear makers

 Calcutta, Jan. 23: The Telecom Equipment Manufacturers? Association (Tema) has requested the government to make it mandatory for operators to procure part of their equipment from domestic companies. This can be done by enforcing the NTP99 clause of the National Telecom Policy. 

 Tema has also recommended policy changes to make it viable for manufacturing units operating under the Electronic Hardware Technology Parks (EHTP) scheme. Tema president N. K. Goyal said, ?The current tax structure makes it cheaper for operators to import equipment than buying it locally. Domestic telecom equipment manufacturers, under the modified EHTP scheme, sell at an effective duty of 26.7 per cent (CST) or 34 per cent (LST). This includes 5 per cent basic duty, 16 per cent CVD, 4 per cent sales tax, which is 10 per cent in case of LST.?

 Under the current tax structure, private operators like Bharti and Tata Teleservices pay only an effective duty of 5 per cent, with nil CVD, SADD and educational cess under the Export Promotion Credit Guarantee scheme.

 Domestic operators like BSNL and MTNL are entitled to import at an effective rate of 16 per cent. This is due to the Project Import scheme, which will become ineffective under the WTO regime.

 A 2 per cent education cess is charged on import of components and raw materials, though import of finished equipment is exempt from the same.?We recommend that the EHTP units should be exempt from the excise of 16 per cent and sales tax. When value-added tax is implemented, it should be applicable to both domestic and foreign vendors,? said Goyal.

 The apex body had earlier suggested that 1.5 per cent of licence fees of telecom operators will serve as buffer stock, which could be used as soft loans to manufacturers. These loans will not attract any interest for 180 days and a nominal interest of 1-2 per cent for three years.

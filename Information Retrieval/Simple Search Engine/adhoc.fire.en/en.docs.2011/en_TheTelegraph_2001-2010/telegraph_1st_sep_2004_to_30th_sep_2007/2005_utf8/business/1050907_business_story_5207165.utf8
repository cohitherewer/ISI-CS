 Citibank finds the going tough in Korea

 Tall order

 Seoul, Sept. 6 (Reuters): Ten months after Citibank acquired KorAm Bank in the first takeover of a South Korean lender by a foreign financial firm, the global giant has finally staunched the outflow of assets and is projecting growth later this year. 

 Citibank expects to complete the combination of computer and other technical systems of South Koreas sixth-largest lender with Citibank Korea by October. 

 But the integration of the $2.7-billion deal has not been easy, nor does Citibank Korea appear to be an imminent threat to local competitors, some analysts say. 

 Citibank still faces the most important and sensitive part of the combination ? winning the support of about 3,800 employees from the former KorAm Bank, many of whom have expressed discomfort about new management and Western business styles. 

 In the case of people integration, I like to compare it with an international marriage, said Yung-Ku Ha, chief executive of Citibank Korea, in a recent interview. It takes more effort and time than previous mergers.

 In July, the labour union even complained to prosecutors about Richard Jackson, the consumer banking head of Citibank Korea, saying he helped the bank make unfair profits. Citibank has denied the allegations as groundless. 

 Citigroups challenges are as much cultural as they are technical. 

 Despite early expectations that Citibank Korea would entice Korean depositors with a variety of new products, it concentrated first on stopping the rapid outflow of assets. The combined entity saw its assets fall about 25 per cent to $47.8 billion as of the end of June, according to its half-year financial results. 

 Its second-quarter earnings declined 8 per cent to 123.6 billion won from the previous quarter, while the combined net profit at 19 Korean banks jumped 36 per cent during the same period. 

 We havent fully utilised our branches because we are in the integration process, said the 52-year-old CEO. This integration of legacy KorAm and Citibank is a growth strategy. We have to grow. He blamed a reduction in real estate project financing and cancellation of some credit card accounts, which the bank categorised as risky assets, for the decline in assets and earnings.

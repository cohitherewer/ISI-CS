 Hotels face RBI heat on tourist payments

 New Delhi, Sept. 25: Hotels are being pulled up for flouting a Reserve Bank directive that makes it mandatory for them to extend the rupee payment option to foreign tourists. 

 The rule had come into force more than five years ago, when the government had passed the Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema). However, most hotels seem to have ignored it and continued to insist on foreign currency payments from tourists.

 ?It has been brought to the notice of the RBI that some of the service providers like hotels quote differential tariff for foreigners in dollars and insist that the payment be made in foreign exchange. This practice is not consistent with the Fema, 1999 and also undermines the legality of the domestic currency in India,? said the latest RBI notice.

 It also added that part of the confusion was probably created by an earlier notice issued in May 2000, which had enabled ?persons resident in India to receive payment in foreign exchange from people resident outside India during their visit to the country?.

 The hotels have twisted an enabling provision to their advantage and insisted on foreign currency payment. The earlier notice ?does not give a right to residents to insist on payment in foreign exchange?. The hotel industry has probably had a vested interest in insisting on foreign currency payments.

 Hotels are allowed to import a range of items, including cars, wine, liquor and exotic food items to the extent of 5 per cent of their foreign exchange earnings in the previous year. Most of them appear to have ignored this rule because it would have dented their dollar earnings.

 Industry sources say they will extend the option to foreigners staying with them. However, they do not apprehend a sharp increase in rupee payments because most foreign tourists prefer to pay through credit cards or travellers? cheques denominated in foreign currency.

 The central bank has now asked the Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association of India, the nodal body of the industry, to inform the hotels about the rule.

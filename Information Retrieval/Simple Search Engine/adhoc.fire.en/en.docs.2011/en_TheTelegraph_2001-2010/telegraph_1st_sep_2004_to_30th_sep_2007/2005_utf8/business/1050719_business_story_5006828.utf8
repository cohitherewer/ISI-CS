 Reaching out

 Mumbai, July 18: Jindal Steel amp; Power Ltd (JSPL) plans to make it big in the steel sector after its success in the sponge iron business.

 The projects lined up by the company, combined with its brownfield expansion plans, will put it in the 10-million-tonne league. Officials said JSPL will achieve this capacity in six years. 

 Recently, JSPL had announced an investment of Rs 11,500 crore for a 5-million-tonne steel unit and a 1000-mw captive power plant in Jharkhand. The company had also made public its intentions of setting up a 2-million-tonne steel plant in Orissa. It subsequently decided to raise the production capacity to 6 million tonnes and shift the project site from Keonjhar to Angul district. JSPL has set aside Rs 15,000 crore for the project. 

 Even as the company is looking at such greenfield ventures, it is simultaneously planning to raise its existing steel making capacity to 2.5 million tonnes from over 1 million tonnes.

 Director (finance) Sushil K. Maroo said, The company will be transformed from a medium-sized steel and power company to a big player over the next few years. It will figure in the big league when these projects are complete. 

 He added that the company has acquired the expertise of executing large projects well ahead of schedule.

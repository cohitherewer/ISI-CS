 New Delhi, Nov. 9: The US delegation led by treasury secretary John Snow today met finance minister P. Chidambaram and deputy chairman of the Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia and pressed India to open up its insurance and pension sectors further to foreign investment and the banking sector to giant US banks. 

 India reportedly has agreed to the US suggestions. Snow later told newspersons: I think the proposal to raise the caps from 26 per cent to 49 per cent is a move in the right direction. We encourage it. 

 The US wants India to extend the same facilities it has given to Singapore banks ? treating on par with Indian banks in terms of number of branches and access to retail banking and financial market. 

 A North Block official said India would not totally open up its banking sector but might allow foreign banks to open more branches to and they could also be given access to retail banking. 

 Snow has reportedly asked India to use its influence on other developing world to try bring about an amicable solution to WTO talks in Hong Kong next month.

 India, on the other hand, wants the US to engage more actively in infrastructure financing for which the visiting delegation have sought a faster dispute settlement mechanism in place and a hike in FDI limit for more infrastructure sectors. 

 India has said it would consider to put in place a fast track arbitration mechanism so that disputes over foreign investments like Enron could be resolved quickly, instead of going through a lengthy judicial process. I would certainly look at that, finance minister P. Chidambaram said, pointing out that India already has laws on the issue. 

 India also assured the US of its commitment in capping money laundering as well as stamping out financing of terrorist activities. I have told the secretary that we are fully committed to checking money laundering as well as financing of terrorist activities, Chidabmbaram said. 

 The two sides discussed on capital markets, banking, insurance and pension sectors besides the global problems posed by money laundering and issues pertaining to infrastructure financing.

 Life sans fear with Tata AIG Nirbhay

 TATA AIG LIFE has launched Nirbhay 

 Life, a money-back plan with a nine-year premium paying 

 term.

 The minimum entry age for the policy is six years and the maximum is 55 years. The plan is available in three versions, for policy terms of 12, 15 and 20 years.

 A policyholder will have to pay the premium for nine years only, irrespective of the term selected. However, the premium amount will vary for different policy terms.

 The plan benefits include:

 A guaranteed payout of 

 130 per cent of the sum assured by the end of the policy 

 term.

 A guaranteed payout of 

 330 per cent of the sum assured in case of any death on 

 or after the second policy anniversary other than an accident.

 A guaranteed payout of 

 430 per cent of the sum assured in case of accidental death 

 on or after the second policy anniversary for policies issued 

 to an individual who is 18 years or above.

 Terminal bonus at the end 

 of policy term.

 In case the policy is taken for a child, it also provides in-built insurance for the policyholders parent with complete waiver of premium.

 In the event of the policyholders death, the dependents will receive double the entire sum assured and in case of accidental death they will receive triple the sum assured.

 Unlike a normal endowment or money-back policy, which stops when the risk cover is paid, with Nirbhay Life, the dreams of the policyholder continue even after death as the family can rest assured that they will continue to receive the promised coupons, till the policy matures without paying further premiums.

 The premiums paid under this policy are eligible for deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

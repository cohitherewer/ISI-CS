 Amforge unit to be merged

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 30: Mahindra amp; Mahindra will invest up to Rs 140 crore in Mahindra Automotive Steel Pvt Ltd to fund its acquisition and growth plans in the auto component business.

 The M amp;M board today also approved the merger of the auto component subsidiary with the forging unit of Amforge Industries at Chakan through a scheme of demerger and arrangement. The proposal, however, awaits the nod of Mumbai High Court. 

 The subsidiary, which manufactures auto-grade steel, gears, sheet metal and composites, is setting up a machining unit. Combined with the Chakan forging business, which makes crankshafts, connector rods, Mahindra Automotive Steel is expected to become one of the largest integrated forging company in the country. 

 Independent valuers have been appointed for the proposed merger. Hemant Luthra, president, Mahindra Automotive Systems and Technologies, hinted at a possible listing of the company when he said the merger intended to form a shareholder-friendly structure. 

 He added that shareholders of Amforge would get a share in the Mahindra unit.

 US keen on better trade ties with China

 Beijing, July 11 (Reuters): Senior Chinese and US officials met for annual trade talks in Beijing on Monday, where Washingtons trade representative planned to press China to open markets and improve enforcement of intellectual property rights.

 The one-day US-China joint commission on commerce and trade (JCCT) session on Monday was also expected to focus on a simmering dispute over Chinese textile exports, which surged this year when a decade-long system of global quotas was abolished.

 US trade representative Rob Portman said a top priority of the meeting would be strengthening the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in China, where piracy of everything from DVDs to golf clubs is widespread.

 I view the annual JCCT meeting as an opportunity to try to remove trade barriers, further open Chinas market to US exports, and level the playing field for American workers, farmers and businesses, he said in a statement.

 As the meeting started, Chinas official Xinhua news agency reported that two US citizens had been jailed in April for selling pirated DVDs through the Internet. It did not give a reason for releasing the news again now.

 Chinese vice premier Wu Yi, US commerce secretary Carlos Gutierrez and Portman was to chair Mondays session, Xinhua said.

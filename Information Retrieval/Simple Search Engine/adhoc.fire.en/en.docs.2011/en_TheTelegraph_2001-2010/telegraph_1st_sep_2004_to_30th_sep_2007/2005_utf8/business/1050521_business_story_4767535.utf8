 Mittal: Stake churn

 New Delhi, May 20: Singapore Telecom (SingTel) has increased its stake in Bharti Telecom from 26.96 per cent to 32.81 per cent by buying up shares worth $252 million through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Pastel Limited.

 Bharti Telecom is an unlisted holding company of Sunil Mittal?s Bharti Tele-Ventures, where it holds a 45.9 per cent stake.

 Bharti officials said the buy has, however, resulted in only a marginal increase in SingTel?s holding in Bharti Tele-Ventures from 28.16 per cent to 30.84 per cent. Government rules allow a foreign investor to own up to 74 per cent in an Indian telecom venture. 

 The norms also say that a majority of the directors on the board, including the chairman, managing director and CEO, have to be resident Indians and at least one resident Indian promoter must own a minimum of 10 per cent in the company. 

 Analysts said the stake increase will not violate any of the government?s terms. 

 Bharti Tele-Ventures simultaneously announced that it would drop plans to float 200 million American depository receipt shares. 

 ?Bharti Tele-Ventures had in July 2004 announced its plans for a sponsored ADR secondary offering of up to 200 million equity shares. The board of directors has decided not to proceed with the ADR due to lack of sponsorship interest from most of its principal shareholders,? the company said.

 Bharti officials see SingTels stake hike as an expression of confidence in India. SingTel has spent $10.27 billion in the past four years buying operators in high-growth Asian nations and expanding its investment in Australia. 

 SingTel owns major stakes in three other Asian carriers ? Thailand?s Advanced Info Service Plc (AIS), Globe Telecom Inc in the Philippines and Indonesia?s PT Telkomsel. 

 India?s fast-growing 53-million-strong mobile phone market is seen as Singapore telecoms best bet along with China. The number of mobile customers here is expected to reach about 80 million by this year.

 Bharti Tele-Ventures, which holds a 21 per cent market share, is locked in a fierce competition for new subsrcibers with Reliance Infocomm, state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam, the Tatas and Hutchison-Max. 

 The firm provides mobile services in all the 23 circles in India as well as fixed-line phone services in 14 circles. It also runs a submarine cable landing station which connects Chennai with Singapore.

 Fresh look at Indo-Pak air links

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 10: India and Pakistan today agreed to take a fresh look at their bilateral air services and shipping agreements and set up a fibre optic link between Amritsar and Lahore.

 A bilateral meeting to review the air services agreement and the shipping protocol of 1975 will be held in Pakistan in September, according to a joint statement released after the two-day trade talks here.

 The two sides hope that a fibre optic link between Amritsar and Lahore will be established and operationalised at the earliest.

 The two teams also agreed to expedite the process of opening branches of scheduled banks in each others country to facilitate bilateral trade. This will form part of implementing the decision taken during the visit of the Pakistan Prime Minister to India in November 2004.

 The two countries recognised the scope for further increase in bilateral trade and discussed measures to enhance mutually beneficial economic and commercial co-operation.

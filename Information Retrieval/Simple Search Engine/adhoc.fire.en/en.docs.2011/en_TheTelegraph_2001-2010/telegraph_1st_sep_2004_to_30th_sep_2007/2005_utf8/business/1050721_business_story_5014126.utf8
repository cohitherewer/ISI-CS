 Focus on US market

 B.R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, July 20: Biocon Ltd is targeting the US therapeutic market when patents on Pravastatin and Simvastatin will expire next year. 

 Our premier products, Simva and Prava statins, will capture large markets following the expiry of US patents early next year, said Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw.

 Currently, the company exports Lovastatin to the US and European markets. The US Food and Drug Administration has already qualified Biocons statins facilities.

 The new facilities will address opportunities that will be thrown open following the expiry of US patents in the January to March quarter of this fiscal, Shaw said.

 Biocons subsidiary, Syngene has signed new contracts in the first quarter ended June 30, which would generate additional revenues this year.

 The strategic partnership of the other subsidiary, Clinigene, with Scirex, the US-based clinical research organisation (CRO), will also generate additional business.

 We have signed a memorandum of understanding with Scirex Corporation, a subsidiary of Omnicom, Shaw said.

 Omnicom is a Fortune 500 company known for its global clinical research work with operations in the US and Europe.

 The emergence of Asia as a clinical development hub has encouraged Scirex to partner with Clinigene.

 Clinical services are projected to be a big business opportunity for CROs worldwide, including Clinigene, Shaw said.

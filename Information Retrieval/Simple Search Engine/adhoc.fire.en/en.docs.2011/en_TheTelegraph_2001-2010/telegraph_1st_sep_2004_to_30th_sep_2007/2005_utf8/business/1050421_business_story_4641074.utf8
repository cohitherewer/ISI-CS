 Airline merger hovers in US sky

 Talking business 

 New York, April 20 (Reuters): US Airways Group Inc and America West Holdings Corp are in advanced merger talks to create what would be the nation?s sixth-largest airline, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 The deal has not been completed and some obstacles remain, particularly since US Airways, the No. 7 US airline, remains in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the newspaper said on its Web site. 

 America West spokesman Phil Gee called the merger report a ?market rumour? and declined to comment further. America West is the eighth-largest US carrier. 

 US Airways could not immediately be reached for comment but has said previously it would not confirm any talks it might have with other airlines or potential investors about acquiring a stake. 

 ?Strategically on the map, the two are a very logical fit,? said Ray Neidl, an analyst with Calyon Securities. 

 But he said a merger would be ?a can of worms? in the short-term because of the complications of integrating the two companies? workforces and fleets. 

 In February, America West chief executive Doug Parker said he expected a wave of mergers to sweep US low-cost carriers and that he saw his company participating. 

 The paper said the combined company would create a low-cost airline with many more route choices. America West has hubs in Phoenix and Las Vegas in the western United States, and US Airways has hubs in Philadelphia and Charlotte in the east. 

 A merger would be a plus for the beleaguered US airline industry overall, cutting some of the excess capacity that has made it tough for airlines to raise fares even as energy prices touch record highs. 

 Still, financing a merger would be a challenge for America West, which had $419 million in cash at the end of last year. ?In this environment, airlines have to husband their cash,? Neidl said. 

 Other recent reports have said the two airlines could enter into a deal short of a full merger, under which America West would make a limited investment in US Airways and the two would coordinate flights through a ?code sharing? agreement. 

 Such a deal would bring ?about 80 per cent of the benefits of a merger without the risks,? Neidl said. 

 A merger would require approval from parties, including the bankruptcy judge and US Airways? top creditor, General Electric Co America West shareholders, unions and the federal government would also need to sign off on it, the newspaper said.

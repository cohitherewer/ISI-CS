 Cell revenue buzz grows louder

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 31: Revenues of the domestic cellular services market will reach Rs 1.05 lakh crore ($24 billion) by 2008-09, recording a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35.6 per cent, Gartner Inc said today.

 With declining service costs and the introduction of low-cost handsets, the entry barriers for cellular services will come down substantially, creating a significant market opportunity, Kobita Desai, principal analyst Asia Pacific for telecom at Gartner, said at the Gartner India Summit 2005 here today.

 According to the research firm, the domestic market has the potential to increase cellular penetration to 30 per cent by 2009, netting more than 300 million connections.

 It also said in the coming years, the capability and capacity to penetrate semi-urban and rural markets will be important determinants to increase market share and create sustainable businesses in the cellular space.

 According to Gartner, the Indian cellular services market had recorded the highest growth across Asia Pacific and Japan in 2004 with a CAGR of 67 per cent.

 It has predicted that the markets of Asia Pacific and Japan will reach $225 billion in 2009, representing a CAGR of 6.2 per cent from 2004. The Indian cellular market will account for 11 per cent of the overall Asia Pacific and Japan market by this year.

 Regulatory constraints have been eased in response to unrelenting market pressures and this has created ideal conditions for growth opportunity, investment and consolidation in the telecom sector, Desai added, while explaining the reasons behind the projected boom.

 However, a large proportion of the market opportunity in India will comprise low-income users, resulting in low average revenue per unit (ARPU). Overall penetration and market opportunity will increase, but with thinner margins, Gartner cautioned. It, therefore, said operators should prepare themselves to work in business environments where ARPU levels are expected to be as low as $5 per month in the next 18-24 months. Operators will struggle to find a balance between yield (income/earnings/margin) and growth to fulfil growth expectations, the firm said.

 However, there is a silver lining. Non-voice value-added services such as ring tones, call-back tones, games and music downloads will generate revenues that will help cushion the pressure on overall service revenues. 

 Mobile data accounted for 7 per cent of service revenue in 2004 and is expected to rise to 20 per cent by 2009. However, it is projected that operators will have limited success in generating incremental revenue from mobile data services on account of limited wallet share for spending beyond basic voice services and the high cost of data services.

 Calcutta, Sept. 18: Godrej amp; Boyce plans to launch colour televisions under the Godrej brand name to create a complete portfolio of consumer appliances.

 ?We entered the consumer electronics market with the launch of DVD players in June,? said Kamal Nandi, vice-president (sales), appliances division, Godrej amp; Boyce. ?The next logical step will be to launch colour televisions, which is among the fastest growing consumer electronic product.?

 However, he declines to give further details about the company?s CTV business plan saying that all is at the concept stage and nothing has been finalised as yet.

 But sources say the project may take off in another 18 months.

 ?We will launch both the conventional cathode-ray picture tube type and flat colour televisions catering to both urban, semi-urban and rural areas,? says Nandi. But he emphasises that the company will not enter the black and white television segment as it is a dying product category.

 The company has not yet decided whether it would manufacture the television sets itself or outsource it from other vendors.

 Currently, the Godrej itself manufactures refrigerators, air-conditioners and washing machines, while it sources its microwaves and DVDs from contract manufacturers.

 Godrej is also contemplating to come out with other consumer electronic products, but the details are not yet been finalised.

 Currently, refrigerators contribute 80 per cent of the company?s turnover from the appliances division while washing machines are the second highest contributor with 15 per cent. The remaining comes from air-conditioners, microwaves and DVD, all of which were launched in June.

 Auto clusters go north

 SATISH JOHN 

 Mumbai, Feb. 23: Auto clusters seem to be the flavour of the month. Mahindra amp; Mahindra has firmed up plans to set up a manufacturing unit in the pilgrimage town of Hardwar, while TVS Motor Company has approved a two-wheeler unit in Himachal Pradesh.

 The TVS unit, being set up at an estimated cost of Rs 90 crore and with an initial annual capacity of 3 lakh vehicles, will be the company?s third factory in India.

 TVS also plans to manufacture two wheelers in Indonesia. The unit will have an annual capacity of 1.20 lakh two-wheelers. 

 M amp;M officials said they are still putting final touches to their plans and have not yet decided whether to make sports utility vehicles or the Renault Logan in Hardwar.

 ?We already have a tractor assembly unit in Rudrapur, which is doing well,? the M amp;M official added. The tractor unit is close to a big market for tractors.

 Other auto majors are also keen to set up base in the two northern states of Uttaranchal and Himachal Pradesh, driven by low-cost wages and tax incentives. 

 FMCG companies like Hindustan Lever, Dabur and Colgate already have manufacturing bases in Himachal Pradesh.

 The move by the two companies is significant as whenever an automobile company sets up a greenfield project, the location sees a simultaneous build-up of infrastructure and provides employment to the local people as ancillary manufacturers cluster around the main production facility.

 ?It will give the two companies ample tax concessions,? an analyst tracking the segment said. 

 There are automobile manufacturing clusters in Haryana, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.

 Analysts say the ancillary units that complement the hub and spoke cluster in every automobile town will have to follow the main company. Ancillary units basically need commitment and the best way to wriggle out a commitment will be to follow the automobile major to the new town. 

 Analysts cite the example of the US, Japan, Italy and France to say that the economies became stronger when automobile companies raised the scale of operations and was a major source of employment.

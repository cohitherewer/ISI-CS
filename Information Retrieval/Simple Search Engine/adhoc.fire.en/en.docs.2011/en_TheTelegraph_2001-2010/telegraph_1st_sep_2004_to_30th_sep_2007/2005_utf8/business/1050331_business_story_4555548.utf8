 Escorts arm buys out Polish firm

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 30: Escorts Agri Machinery Inc, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Escorts Limited, has acquired a 100 per cent stake in Polish firm Farmtrac Tractors Europe (FTES).

 Rakesh Chopra, business head of Escorts Limited?s agri machinery group, said: ?The entire share capital of the Polish company is about $2 million. We had about two-thirds of the capital already. Now we have bought the balance, to make it a company 100 per cent owned by us.? 

 Escorts AMG aims at an aggressive growth in tractor exports in the new financial year. The Polish deal comes close on the heels of a major export order worth $8.56 million that Escorts AMG won recently from the Ghana government for tractors and other farm mechanisation equipment. 

 Chopra said: ?After the order we won recently from Ghana and the acquisition of our Polish JV, we intend to seek a larger market share for our Farmtrac Tractors in European countries and further strengthen our brand equity in international markets in future.?

 In June 2000, Escorts had bought a 49 per cent stake in FTES, which was subsequently raised to 64 per cent in May 2003. FTES, which was earlier known as Pol-Mot Escorts Sp.zo.., is a Polish limited liability company with a share capital of $2 million. It is based at Mragowo, near Warsaw.

 The acquisition will enable Escorts to expand its European base, by increasing the reach of its Farmtrac range of tractors, with a deeper penetration into the extremely competitive western European markets and fast growing African, Asian and Latin American markets. 

 Farmtrac has a presence in the US, central and eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia.

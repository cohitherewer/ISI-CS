 Calcutta, June 17: JM Mutual Fund has launched a new open-ended equity scheme, JM Emerging Leaders Fund, beginning June 16 and hopes to mop up Rs 200 crore during the initial offer period. The scheme will close on July 4.

 Our last fund offering, JM Derivative Fund, the first fund of its kind in the country, mobilised Rs 823 crore, said Krishnamurthy Vijayan, chief executive officer, JM Financial Mutual Fund.

 Following the success of the derivative fund, JM Mutual plans to introduce other such funds based on unique themes. However, nothing has been finalised yet, mentioned Vijayan.

 JM Emerging Leaders is its second diversified equity scheme after JM Equity Fund and its sixth equity-oriented fund.

 The primary objective of the scheme is long-term capital appreciation from investments in a portfolio of stocks across all market capitalisation range, said the fund manager Sandeep Neema, who is also fund manager of JM Equity and Balanced Fund. 

 The portfolio of stocks would include those companies operating in emerging sectors of the economy and companies which have potential to become leaders in the future, he added.

 Patni board clears ADR issue

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 21: Patni Computer Systems will raise up to $150 million through American depository receipts. The money will be used to finance acquisitions in future.

 The board of directors, at a meeting held on February 19, had approved the ADRs, the company informed the Bombay Stock Exchange today. 

 The proposal is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, it added. 

 Patni will join Infosys, Wipro and Satyam, three Indian software majors which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 Patni Computers, which services leading clients like General Electric Company and Electrolux AB, said the $150 million it expects to raise from the US flotation would include bids in excess of shares on offer. 

 The company is close to appointing Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Merrill Lynch amp; Co and ABN Amro Rothschild LLC as advisers to the share sale. 

 General Electric, the world?s largest company by market value, contributed 32 per cent of Patnis sales last year compared with 41 per cent a year ago. 

 The percentage of GE?s business to Patni?s total revenues may have dwindled but it only means that the company has been able to diversify its clientele.

 Recently, Patni acquired US-based Cymbal Corp, a software company specialising in writing software for telecommunication companies. The acquisition, made in October last year, helped the company diversify into telecom software. 

 Patni?s fourth-quarter profit rose 15 per cent to Rs 72.45 crore as sales surged 25 per cent. 

 The company?s shares were offered at Rs 230 apiece when they were put on the block a year ago. The sixth-largest software firm in India had raised Rs 430 crore from its maiden issue in January 2004. 

 The company recently said it will spend as much as Rs 100 crore to set up a new software development facility. The centre in Pune will take in 2,000 employees. There are plans to buy another 15 acres for for another campus in the city.

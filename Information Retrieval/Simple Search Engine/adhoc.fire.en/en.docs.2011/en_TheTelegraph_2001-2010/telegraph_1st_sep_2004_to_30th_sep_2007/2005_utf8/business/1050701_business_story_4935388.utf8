 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 30: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Microsoft are teaming up with state-owned software firms in China to form a joint venture company to outsource services and solutions.

 It is touted as the largest initiative by an Indian software major in China. Initiated by Sino-India Cooperative Office of China, the joint venture will be located in Beijings Zhongguancun Software Park. It plans to start operations in early 2006. The joint venture will provide IT outsourcing services and solutions to global markets, particularly in the US, Europe and Asia Pacific, including China.

 This venture shows the credibility established by TCS in China in a short span of time, said TCS chief executive officer and managing director S. Ramadorai.

 The joint venture will leverage the strengths of investing parties in technology, software development management, talent training and experience in handling large and industrial projects. TCS is committed to this initiative and the venture will be integrated into our global delivery model, the MD said.

 As part of this strategic partnership, TCS will hold a majority stake in the joint venture. Apart from Mircosoft, which has joined the venture as a strategic partner with minority stake, the other three entities are Beijing Zhongguancun Software Park Development Company Ltd, Uniware Company Ltd and Tianjin Huayuan Software Park Construction and Development Company Ltd.

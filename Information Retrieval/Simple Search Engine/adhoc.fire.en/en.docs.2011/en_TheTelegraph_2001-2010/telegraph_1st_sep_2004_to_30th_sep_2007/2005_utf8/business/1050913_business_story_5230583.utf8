 Trai scanner on Net service providers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 12: Internet service providers will now have to obtain explicit consent of customers before offering chargeable value-added services. 

 The telecom regulator (Trai) today issued a directive making it mandatory for Internet service providers (ISPs) to obtain explicit consent of the subscribers before making value-added services chargeable. 

 The order is in the context of instances that have come to the notice of the regulators where ISPs charge the subscribers for value-added services without taking their consent beforehand. 

 M. Kannan, economic adviser, Trai, said, A prominent ISP had recently provided value-additions in the form of unlimited access at a monthly fee. The service was activated to all dial-up customers with the condition that unless the customer calls the customer care of the operator on a specific number and un-subscribes the service, the monthly charge gets automatically applicable. 

 In such cases, the onus of declining the chargeable service is put on the customer. We have noticed a pattern of such schemes, both in the form of quality and quantity of service, particularly in relation to broadband and internet. So we have decided to warn the service providers and stop such practices, said Kannan. 

 He also said if a customer failed to unsubscribe for a service due to one reason or the other, he got charged without a concurrence. This, too, amounts to offering and charging for a service without explicit consent of the customer, Kannan added. 

 A systematic violation of the principles laid down in the law cannot be allowed. With this direction, the authority intends to put an end to such practices, Kannan clarified. 

 The Trai directive follows a similar order issued last month that forbade the fixed and mobile operators from pushing customers to accept a value-added service. The ISP industry welcomed the move and sought regulatory intervention to book the violators. 

 Amitabh Singhal, president, Internet Service Providers Association of India, said, In principle, it is a good move to protect the interest of the customers. The Trai also needs to follow it up strictly and implement earlier directives aimed at benefiting consumers.

 Trai member D.P.S. Seth said, We have not received complaints since the directive about the unwarranted levy for value-added service was issued. If there is an instance we will take necessary action.

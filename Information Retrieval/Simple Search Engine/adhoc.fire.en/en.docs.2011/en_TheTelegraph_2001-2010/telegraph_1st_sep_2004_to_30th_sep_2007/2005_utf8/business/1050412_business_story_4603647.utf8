 Mastek Q3 net soars

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 11: Software services firm Mastek Limited today reported a robust performance for the third quarter of 2004-05. The company?s earnings rose 115 per cent to Rs 12.40 crore during the January to March quarter compared with Rs 5.77 crore in the corresponding previous period.

 Total income increased to Rs 89.62 crore from Rs 34.26 crore in the year-ago period.

 On a consolidated basis, the group posted a net profit of Rs 13.76 crore during the period under review against Rs 10.02 crore in the previous fiscal. Total income was up at Rs 150.11 crore compared with Rs 117.46 crore in the same period of 2003-04.

 With effect from January 1, the business model of it?s UK operations has been changed. Following this, Mastek has started executing on-site projects in the UK, which were earlier executed by its subsidiary. 

 ?The revenue earned and the cost incurred by the company for executing such projects is included in the results of the reporting quarter. Hence, the figures for the previous periods are not comparable,? the company said.

 Unveiling its guidance for the April to June quarter, Mastek said the group?s income would be in the range of Rs 152-157 crore and net profit after tax and minority interest in the range of Rs 14.25-15.25 crore.

 Chairman Ashank Desai said, ?During the past six to seven quarters our efforts have been towards delivering a predictable growth. For the last four quarters, our guidance and results are an indicator of this trend. We will continue our endeavour in this direction.?

 Although the company?s core business in the US has turned the corner, Mastek is dissatisfied with its growth rate in that country, Desai added. 

 During the quarter, Mastek billed three additional customers. In Europe, it has signed a deal with a leading manufacturer of sensors and sensor solutions for their industrial application worldwide, while two projects were secured from its existing customers in the US. 

 A Fortune 1000 insurance major has awarded a $2.5-million project to Mastek for implementing a new back-office system for its distribution arms. Similarly, a large Fortune 1000 investment company has awarded the customer data warehousing project valued at $2 million.

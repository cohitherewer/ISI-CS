 Court junks plea on Birla Corp control

 Lodha: New boost

 Calcutta, Aug. 24: Just two days ahead of the annual general meeting of Birla Corporation, Calcutta High Court recognised Rajendra Singh Lodhas control over the MP Birla group flagship company. 

 Some shareholders had appealed to the court to investigate the power structure in Birla Corporation. The court today dismissed the plea and said there was no ground for ordering any further investigation.

 Justice Indira Banerjee said the company law board had decided that the controlling interest in the company was still with the estate of Priyamvada Birla, wife of MP Birla. Therefore, an investigation into the controlling pattern was unwarranted. 

 At present, Lodha is the chairman of Birla Corporation.

 Todays order is very significant as both the CLB and the high court have accepted Lodhas control over Birla Corporation. Had the order been otherwise, there would have been major problems in conducting the AGM, an observer said. 

 The petitioners had claimed that since an estate could not have a mind of its own, an investigation was necessary to find out the true persons controlling the company. 

 Lodhas counsel claimed there had been no change in management or shareholding pattern of the company since the death of Priyamvada. 

 Control over the MP Birla group has been an issue since the inheritance controversy over the assets of the group became public last year. 

 Lodhas claim that Priyamvada made him the sole successor of the assets of the MP Birla group led to a fierce legal battle with the Birla family. 

 The extent of acrimony between the two sides was felt at Birla Corps stormy AGM last year. Shareholders loyal to the Birlas had a major showdown with Lodhas followers. To avoid a repetition this year, Birla Corporation has sought imposition of Section 144 in and around the venue of the meeting.

 Though Lodha had alleged that the countrys first business family was behind the application, Justice Banerjee observed that there was no evidence that the Birla family had set up the shareholders.

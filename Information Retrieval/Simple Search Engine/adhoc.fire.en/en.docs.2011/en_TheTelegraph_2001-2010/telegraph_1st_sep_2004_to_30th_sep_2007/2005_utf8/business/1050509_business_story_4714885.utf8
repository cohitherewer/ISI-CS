 Frill gives a thrill

 Chandralekha Tulal takes a close look at the variants of diversified equity funds 

 Plain vanilla ice cream is no fun. But add some hot chocolate, strawberry sauce, almonds, nuts or other exotic mix and almost none can resist it. 

 The same psychology might be the reason as to why mutual fund houses come out with new and improved variants of plain-vanilla diversified equity funds. 

 By definition, a diversified equity fund knows no boundaries while investing in the stock market. At any point of time, it may hold stocks across various market capitalisations and sectors. It also means that at any point of time, irrespective of market swings, majority of the funds corpus will remain invested in equities and there is little flexibility to shift to fixed income instruments. 

 However, within the diversified category, fund managers can concentrate and adopt specific investment style such as growth or value investing or market capitalisation such as large-cap, mid-cap or small-cap stocks. 

 Says Tridib Pathak, chief investment officer of Chola Mutual Fund, quot;Few years back, just a diversified equity fund was sufficient in a mutual fund house portfolio. But the alluring markets of the recent times are resulting in these funds getting segmented. With further product innovation, we will witness more variants being offered to investors. quot; 

 The latest and the most fashionable of such themes is the mid-cap fund with almost 10 such schemes being launched during the last calendar year. Four more have been launched since January this year, while another two, including HSBC Midcap Equity and ING Vysya Midcap, are under way. However, Franklin Prima remains the oldest and one of the most popular mid-cap fund. 

 Before the mid-cap stocks came into limelight during the latest bull run on the bourses, large-cap funds were the preferred ones resulting in Franklin Blue Chip Fund becoming the single largest fund with a corpus of Rs 2,000 crore. When the mid-cap flavour started waning off or when the fund houses had both large- and mid-cap funds in their portfolio, flexi cap funds came into the scene and Franklin Flexicap mopped up a record Rs 1,950 crore during the initial offer period. It meant that the funds had the flexibility to invest across various market capitalisations. 

 Then there are themes based on investment styles, the most popular being growth-oriented stocks. In fact, the objective of the first diversified scheme ? UTI Mastershare was to invest in a growth-oriented portfolio. 

 However, the most interesting investment style is that of value investing. HDFC Capital Builder is one of the first funds to belong to this sub category. Again, there are funds, which believe in mix and match of investment styles such as UTI Growth and Value Fund. 

 Apart from such classifications, fund managers often bet on various investment objectives such as concentrating on select stocks, select sectors, and index stocks but not in the proportion of the index or any such popular or time-tested theme. 

 For example, Chola Mutual Fund has recently launched Chola Global Advantage, which will invest in companies that earn more than 20 per cent from export earnings. The first such fund to be launched with such an objective was Canexpo, which specified that it will predominantly invest in companies with substantial forex earnings. 

 Another such theme which is always in fashion is opportunity. Opportunity funds have an ultra-aggressive approach towards fund management. Such schemes seek opportunity and move across sectors and stocks, based on the attractiveness at any given point of time. They even have the flexibility to shift to fixed-income instruments when the fund managers outlook on the market becomes cautious or negative. The first opportunity fund was launched by DSPML in 2000. 

 Another interesting theme is dividend yield fund, which means investing in stocks with a high dividend yield. UTI Mutual Fund recently closed the IPO of its fund based on this theme, while Birla mutual fund was the first to introduce the idea. 

 So, now the big question. If all these funds have such varied investment objectives, is it right to pit them against each other and judge them, as each is bound to have its own different ups and downs and, thus, uneven performance. 

 As Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research says, ?We classify each fund based on their investment style ? growth, value or blend ? and market capitalisation ? large, medium or small. However, we realise that there are various other sub-categories, the comparison of which is not suitable across the broad category of diversified funds. Nevertheless, till such time more funds are created within those sub-categories; it will not be possible to judge them separately.?

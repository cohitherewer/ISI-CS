 Sweet nothings on sugar salvation

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Death by chocolate? No more

 Calcutta, Oct. 3: Tempted by those sinful pastries? Can?t resist succulent rossogollas? Not easy for a diabetic to answer, but the torment could melt away soon.

 Those who always prayed for a sugar substitute in their favourite dish will reach for sucralose, a third-generation sweetener that Alembic plans to put on the shelves soon, and bring back the taste that diabetics had feared they had lost for life.

 Sucralose frees those who have been using sugar substitutes only in tea and coffee. Known to the West for some time, the sucralose molecule was patented by J amp;J for 20 years before the protection ended in 1995. 

 In August 1999, United States Food and Drug Administration approved sucralose for use as a general-purpose sweetener, expanding the categories to include all food and beverage applications.

 Sucralose was discovered in 1976 during a research in Queen Elizabeth College, University of London. Made by a patented multi-step process that starts with sugar (sucrose) and replaces three hydrogen?oxygen groups on the sugar molecule with three chlorine atoms, it is not recognised by the human body as carbohydrate. It does not melt into blood; nor does it bind with proteins. 

 Back home, it was an unknown quantity, and no Indian firm worth its salt had woken up to this sweet opportunity. Alembic, however, might leave a swarm of followers.

 There is no reason why it won?t. After all, India has world?s largest number of sugar-challenged folks. Studies show diabetics rising to 300 million by 2025 from 32.7 million. These are people who grab 70 per cent of all sweeteners made in the country. 

 Sucralose will be different from its predecessors, the aspartame-based products that disintegrate in high temperatures; that makes them unfit for cooking and baking. 

 Now, the bitter part of the sweet story ? a 70-gram pack will set you back by Rs 140. That means sucralose will not be everyone?s cup of tea. 

 Alembic?s head of consumer healthcare, Geogi Zachariah, can digest that. ?We are targeting only A1 and A2 socio economic class,? he says about his product, sporting the Zero brand name.

 Zachariah hopes sucralose will help expand the Rs 60-crore sweetener market, growing at a dizzy pace of 60-70 per cent, though he concedes high prices could take more than a bite out of potential sales and prevent its use on a much larger scale. It is hardly surprising therefore that Zero would be sold through super markets, department stores and high-street grocery outlets.

 Alembic hopes to corner a 10 per cent market share in the first full year of sucralose?s launch as a sugar substitute in cooking.

 Sucralose costs 20 per cent more than the regular product around. Ordinary sugar ? which sucralose might attempt to replace ? comes at Rs 20 a kg. So, banish comparisons.

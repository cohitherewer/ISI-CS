 Seeds of change for rural banks

 Better days ahead

 Mumbai, Nov. 4: With the mergers and amalgamations among regional rural banks (RRBs) gathering momentum, the Union finance ministry is planning to make sponsor banks accountable for the performance of their rural subsidiaries.

 The ministry is reportedly also readying itself to welcome proposals from RRBs for venturing into non-charted areas such as NRI remittances, non-agricultural loans, to name a few. This may see the rural banks extending into activities beyond their core business of providing agricultural credit. 

 The number of RRBs in the country has come down from 196 a couple of years ago to 177 following their merger into a single bank in some states. The Centre is keen on this pace picking up further and the number reducing to 50-60 over a period of time. 

 The financial performances of these banks have also improved considerably even as the merger process continues. If you see the RRB system as a whole, it is earning profits. However, there are certain aberrations due to historical reasons. The rural banks in the Northeast or the eastern region are lower down the performance scale than those in the western, southern or central parts of the country, a senior bank official said. 

 Against this backdrop, the government, more particularly the finance minister, is keen that operating performances of the rural banks improve further. 

 Sources said at a meeting held last month, Union finance minister P. Chidambaram outlined the environment he was creating to bolster these banks. Firstly, with the mergers leading to cost reduction for amalgamated banks, the government wants them expand to districts that have not been covered till now. Such an entry is expected to result in optimum utilisation of the work force. Secondly, the government wants the sponsor commercial banks to shoulder specific responsibilities regarding the performance of their rural subsidiaries. 

 The finance minister has made it clear that sponsor banks will be made accountable for any lapses in the functioning, including financial performances, of their RRBs. Now, one general manager in the headquarters of all sponsor banks has been given the responsibility of RRBs, the bank official said.

 The finance ministry is also closely examining a proposal to allow RRBs to have a token presence in state capitals. It is felt that rural banks must be present in centres like state capitals which would give them better market access, the source added.

 It is also understood that the government would welcome any proposal from RRBs to get into non-core activities. While a couple of rural banks in Kerala offer NRI remittance facility, some others have ramped up consumer durable loans.

 Air France profit soars 56%

 Standing tall

 Paris, Nov. 23 (Reuters): Air France KLM has posted a stronger-than-expected 56 per cent jump in second-quarter operating profit, driving up its shares on traffic growth and cost savings from last years Franco-Dutch merger.

 The European airline group also firmed up a confident outlook for the rest of the year, announcing figures that suggested 2005-06 operating income would gain at least 50 per cent to more than 750 million euros ($885 million).

 The worlds largest airline by revenues reported sales for its July-September quarter up 10 per cent at 5.64 billion euros, beating an average Reuters Estimates forecast of 5.55 billion. 

 Operating profits rose 55.8 per cent to 528 million euros, compared with a forecast of 417 million, and net profit came in at 717 million euros, up more than threefold due to the sale of a stake in the Amadeus reservations system. 

 First-half operating profit reached 750 million euros. 

 Air France KLM, which had previously predicted a significant increase in its full-year operating profit, said it expected to add a clearly positive profit in the second half to the 750 million euros generated in the first half. 

 Airline officials agreed the forecast implied operating profits would rise at least 50 per cent compared with the latest proforma comparison of 483 million euros for the year before. 

 The merger is living up to its promise and in fact doing better than expected, deputy chief executive Pierre-Henri Gourgeon said.

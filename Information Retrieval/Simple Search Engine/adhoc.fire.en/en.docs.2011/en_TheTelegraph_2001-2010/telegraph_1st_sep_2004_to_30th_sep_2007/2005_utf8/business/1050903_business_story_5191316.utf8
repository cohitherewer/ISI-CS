 FDI norms relaxed for NRIs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 2: The department of industrial policy has introduced more liberal FDI norms for non-resident Indians (NRIs).

 All proposals by NRIs for converting non-repatriable equity into repatriable equity will now come under the automatic approval route provided the original investment by them was made in foreign exchange under the FDI scheme.

 Moreover, the sector or activity in which the investment is proposed to be converted into repatriable equity will have to be on the automatic route for FDI.

 Until now, proposals for conversion of NRI investment into repatriable equity had to be sent to the Foreign Investment Promotion Board for approval. 

 Earlier, under the press note 4 of 2001, investments by NRIs made in foreign exchange on a non-repatriable basis were allowed to be made fully repatriable, whereas investment made in the Indian currency, though rupee account, continued to remain non-repatriable. 

 According to an official statement issued today, the government has now modified press note 4 that gives detailed guidelines on NRI investments.

 With the department of industrial policy and promotion issuing a modified press note 4 (2005), all proposals will now qualify for conversion of non-repatriable equity into repatriable equity under the automatic route. This is subject to the original investment being in foreign exchange and the sector included in the automatic route.

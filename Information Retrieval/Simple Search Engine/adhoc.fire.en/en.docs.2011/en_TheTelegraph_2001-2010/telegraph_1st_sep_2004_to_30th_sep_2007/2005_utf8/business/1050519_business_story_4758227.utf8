 Posco plant fine, not ore exports, says Tata

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, May 18: Investment Commission chairman Ratan Tata today met mines minister Sis Ram Ola and said Pohang Steel Company (Posco) should be allowed to set up its steel plant in India, provided it does not merely export iron ore to other steel-producing countries.

 The $12-billion Posco investment in Orissa has crucially hinged on the South Korean steelmakers demand that it should be given a mining ore lease far in excess of the requirement for its 12 million-tonne steel plant. 

 Posco had initially sought assurance of one billion tonnes of iron ore, accounting for about one-third of the states total iron ore reserves. The Korean steelmaker needed just 600 million tonnes for its steel plant and sought permission to export 400 MT to its mother plant in Korea.

 Tata told Ola that the allocation of raw material to a company should be based on the size of the project.

 The Tata group chief met the minister to discuss details on policy, investment strategy, production and industrialisation through foreign direct investment (FDI). 

 He said the country should try to add value to its natural resources. He reckoned that India, which had large deposits of iron ore, should get all the benefits of its resources.

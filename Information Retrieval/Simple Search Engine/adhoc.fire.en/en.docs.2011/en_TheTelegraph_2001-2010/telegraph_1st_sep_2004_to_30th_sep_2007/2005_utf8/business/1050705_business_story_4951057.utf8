 Bengal sets deadline for Purnendu

 Purnendu: Time bound

 Calcutta, July 4: The Bengal government has set Purnendu Chatterjee a timeframe for bringing in the funds needed to buy out its 36.87 per cent stake in Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL).

 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told The Telegraph: The process of selling the governments stake in HPL is on the right path. We have fixed a deadline within which the issue has to be settled.

 Bhattacharjee, however, refused to spell out the deadline. I will specify later, he said.

 Sources in Writers Buildings said the deadline expires on July 31. Purnendu flew down to Calcutta last week to talk to state government officials on the stake buyout.

 There are whispers that Purnendu had met Ashok Hinduja of the Hinduja group to jointly pitch for the governments stake. However, the HPL top brass refused to confirm the move.

 In early 2002, the Hindujas were keen on investing in HPL. Purnendu had met the Hinduja brothers in London to discuss the issue. However, the Left Front government was not willing to bring in the Hindujas as their names had appeared in the Bofors case.

 But now that the Delhi High Court has quashed the charges against the Hinduja brothers and the Bofors company, the state is not against the idea of the Hindujas investing in Bengal.

 Ashok Hinduja, who met Bhattacharjee in the Assembly on Thursday, has expressed interest in invest in the states petrochemicals sector. 

 The government had offered its stake in HPL to Purnendu at Rs 30 ? a premium of Rs 20 on a share of Rs 10. TCG has to shell out Rs 1,560 crore for the deal.

 Sources said Purnendu told state government officials last week that the delay in getting the RBIs permission was holding back the funds. 

 The State Bank of India has agreed to provide Purnendu a loan of Rs 1,350 crore.

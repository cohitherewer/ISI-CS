 Calcutta, Aug. 22: Bharti Tele-Ventures (BTVL) will invest nearly $1 billion in the current financial year to expand its operations and network.

 The company is spending close to $1 billion to expand its network coverage, especially in the untapped rural areas, BTVL joint managing director Rajan Bharti Mittal said at the 10GSM meet, which was hosted here to celebrate 10 years of GSM service in the country.

 We are already present in 2800 towns and plan to reach out to 2200 more, each with a population of over 5000, by March 2006, he said. We will move into the next level of expansion in less populated areas after the current phase.

 He said sub-1000 handsets, which are expected to hit the market by next year-end and monthly expenditure of as low as Rs 200 to stay connected will drive growth in the rural market.

 PCO penetration in small markets was the key to growth and increased teledensity, Rajan Swaroop, director (east regional hub-mobility) of BTVL, said.

 While teledensity (connections per 1000) in urban areas is close to 10, it is as low as 1.74 in rural areas. Around 800 million Indians are outside cellular network coverage.

 Bharti also plans to roll out its fixed and broadband services in Calcutta and the east in the next two months. The company now offers these services in 14 circles. On June 30, its fixed subscriber base was 934503. The company has 170 fixed phone users in Calcutta, where it offers these services on a pilot basis.

 We are laying cables, both copper and optic fibre, to expand the fixed phone business, said Mittal. The company will not offer fixed wireless services.

 In June last year, Bharti merged its key corporate account functions of mobility and fixed line businesses with the broadband and data group ? Bharti Infotel ? to create a new strategic business unit (SBU) ? Enterprise Business.

 The merger was mainly aimed at facilitating corporate accounts to avail of the mobile services of Airtel, fixed line Touchtel services and Infotel broadband services through a single business entity.

 Mittal said other initiatives of the company included expanding the Future Factory ? incubation centres for mobile applications ? along with partners like Intel, Ericsson and Siemens.

 We have set up seven centres in the major metros where developers can showcase their hardware and software applications. These will then be finetuned into customer applications, said Mittal. The four main areas will be mobile entertainment, mobile commerce, wireless business solutions and rural applications.

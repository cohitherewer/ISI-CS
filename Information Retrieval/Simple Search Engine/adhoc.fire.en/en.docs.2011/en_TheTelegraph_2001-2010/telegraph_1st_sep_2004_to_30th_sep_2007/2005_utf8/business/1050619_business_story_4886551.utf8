 Infocomm market debut by year end

 Answering IPO call 

 New Delhi, June 18: Reliance Infocomm is set to be listed on the National Stock Exchange during the third quarter of the current financial year.

 A top company executive said Reliance Infocomm could come out with a public issue in the range of Rs 5,000-6,000 crore. Sources said the internal evaluation of the company had projected a market capitalisation between Rs 20,000 and Rs 25,000 crore.

 But before coming out with a public issue, Anil Ambani will have to amalgamate the telecom companies within his fold. Currently, Reliance Communications Infrastructure Ltd (RICL) has two subsidiary companies ? Reliance Infocomm Ltd (RIL) and Reliance Communications Ltd (RCL). The third company Reliance Telecom Ltd (RTL) is a separate company.

 None of these companies are listed. RCL holds the licences for most of the telecom operations. Thus, Reliance Infocomm does not hold these licences directly. Sources said a few of the licences were transferred when it opted for a unified access service licence (UASL). 

 Under the terms of the settlement, a special purpose vehicle (SPV) is proposed to be formed where Reliance Industries holding in Reliance Infocomm will be transferred.

 According to sources in Reliance Infocomm, The SPV will hold the shares owned by both Mukesh and Anil Ambani in Reliance Industries and other companies that get distributed as part of the settlement.

 Reliance Infocomm is not a listed company and the transfer of shares from the SPV to Reliance Infocomm will attract capital gains tax. But once it is listed, the transfer can be done by paying the transaction tax. Capital gains tax is higher than the transaction tax, said a senior executive of Reliance Infocomm. 

 Reliance Infocomm has already invested Rs 15,000 crore in the company. The investment includes licence fee of more than Rs 2,000 crore for all the 21 circles.

 The company has a subscriber base of more than 1.1 crore ?mobile and fixed subscribers. But it has not been able to improve on its average revenue per user (ARPU) which stands at Rs 400.

 A Reliance Infocomm executive said, The initial problems of bad billing continued to plague us in some quarters during the last financial year. But we are satisfied with the new software that has improved our billing and collection. The ARPU should jump by 20-30 per cent during this year.

 The company recorded a revenue of Rs 5,387 crore during the year ended March 2005. Revenues for the quarter ended March stood at Rs 1,659 crore.

 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of Reliance Infocomm for the year 2004-05 was Rs 912 crore. During the last quarter ended March 2005, it was Rs 400 crore. The EBITDA margin was 16.9 per cent for the financial year 2004-05 and 24.1 per cent for the quarter ended March 2005.

 S. P. Shukla, who is the president of wireless products and services division of Reliance Infocomm, is likely to head the mobility business in the interim period. Prakash Bajpai, the second senior executive responsible for the broadband and wireline business, is likely to continue with the same designation.

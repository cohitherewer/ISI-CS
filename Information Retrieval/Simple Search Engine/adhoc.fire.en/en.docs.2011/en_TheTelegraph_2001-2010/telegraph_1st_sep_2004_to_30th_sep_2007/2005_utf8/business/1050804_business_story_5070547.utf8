 Calcutta, Aug. 3: The National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development (Nabard) has sought a Rs 14,000-crore assistance from the government to lend to farmers at 9 per cent interest.

 At present, farmers get agricultural loans through co-operative banks at a rate of 11 per cent. We want to lend at a cheaper rate. If we get some assistance from the government, we can pass it on to the farmers. The proposal has been submitted to the government recently, Nabard chairperson Ranjana Kumar said at the Banking Conclave organised by Ficci (eastern region). 

 The different tiers in the co-operative banking system also needed to be eliminated to lower the interest rates charged from farmers, she said.

 Kumar has expressed concern over the decreasing share of co-operative banks in farm credit, which has declined from 62 per cent in 1992 to 27 per cent at present.

 She said regional rural banks (RRBs) and commercial banks had increased their shares in this area. 

 This was primarily a result of higher interest rates charged by co-operative banks, she added.

 Nabard has also decided to reset the interest rates. The refinancing institution took a hit of Rs 314 crore for resetting the loans of farmers (through co-operatives) in Rajasthan, Karnataka, Haryana, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh in 2004-05.

 Kumar said there was a need for capital formation in the farm sector, for which Nabard would hike investment credit. Refinance assistance to banks to support capital formation in agriculture was Rs 8,547 crore during 2004-05 compared with Rs 7,605 crore in 2003-04.

 Nabard would also tap the market for domestic borrowings, she said. 

 Last financial year, Nabard reported an operational surplus of Rs 1,332 crore, while the budgeted figure was Rs 1,042 crore.

 Nabard had decided to retire high-cost borrowings and replace them with an equivalent of refinance. 

 The capital adequacy ratio of Nabard is 36 per cent. It expects to maintain disbursals this fiscal at the last years level.

 Kumar added that Nabard has provided funds worth Rs 42,000 crore under the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund to states in the last 10 years.

 The country should aim to achieve a 4 per cent growth in agriculture if it wants a double-digit growth, she added.

 End of the road for MG Rover

 Blind Alley

 Longbridge, England, April 8 (Reuters): MG Rover, the last major British-owned carmaker, collapsed on Friday in a blow to Prime Minister Tony Blair?s government as it seeks re-election.

 The 100-year-old carmaker, which once made the iconic Mini and the Land Rover, had hoped China?s Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp (SAIC) would step in and invest in the company, allowing it to continue production.

 But failure to secure a deal with SAIC forced the demise of the company, putting 6,000 jobs at risk at its Longbridge plant near Britain?s second city Birmingham. Another 15,000 jobs could be affected at suppliers.

 Blair and his finance minister Gordon Brown rushed to Birmingham to hold talks on the company?s collapse, the Prime Minister?s office said. MG Rover announced it had asked accountancy firm PwC to act as administrators. 

 Workers were downcast as they emerged from a meeting with trade union representatives, who spelled out redundancy terms.

 ?It feels terrible,? said 43-year-old Ashley Wilkes, who has worked at Longbridge for 18 years. ?They?ve just told us we?re entitled to ?280 ($524) for each year?s service, up to a maximum of 12 years.?

 Rover?s plight could hardly have come at a worse time for Blair?s ruling Labour Party, campaigning hard on the back of its economic record ahead of an election on May 5.

 ?It?s appaling timing for the government,? said Colin Hay, political analyst at Birmingham University. ?But there is an element that the writing was on the wall for a time and the question is how much people will blame the government.?

 Trade and industry secretary Patricia Hewitt, conscious that Longbridge lies close to three constituencies where Labour has only a slim majority, said the government would do all it could to help workers at the plant.

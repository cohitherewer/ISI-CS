 Oil price nears $64

 London, Aug. 8 (Reuters): Oil soared towards $64 a barrel to a new record high on Monday on fears of militant attacks in the worlds biggest oil exporter Saudi Arabia and a possible gasoline shortage in the US.

 As the US shut its diplomatic missions in Saudi Arabia in response to threats, Britain warned that militants were in the final stages of planning strikes.

 The latest security threats in Saudi Arabia, even though theyre not directed at oil installations per se, and the continuing refinery issues are having a supportive role, said Marshall Steeves, an analyst at Refco Group.

 Concerns over the security situation in Saudi Arabia coincided with news that yet another US refinery had run into output problems, adding to worries that the country may run short of gasoline before the summer ends.

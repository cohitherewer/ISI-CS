 Survey on power sends shockwaves

 Energy crisis

 New Delhi, May 23: With the soaring temperature showing little respite, states across the country are in for a severe power crisis. 

 If the requirement-availability data for electricity in different states are any indication, then Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Meghalaya are likely to be the worst hit in the coming months.

 According to a survey conducted by Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of india (Assocham), the energy shortfall in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Haryana ranged from 7 per cent to 25 per cent in April. This will affect the industrial and agricultural production in those states, the survey said.

 Maharashtra, which recently plunged into a political quagmire after the stoppage of free power supply to farmers, is going through its worst power shortages with the energy deficit recorded at 19 per cent.

 With a peak-time deficit of over 4,000 megawatt, the state is resorting to a 4-5 hours load shedding every day.

 The lack of fresh investments and modernisation of the existing power generation and distribution systems, coupled with huge transmission losses, have aggravated the grave power situation in the country, said Assocham president Mahendra K. Sanghi.

 Madhya Pradesh, for instance, is receiving 2,250 million units of power against a demand for 3,003 million units, which has resulted in a deficit of over 25 per cent.

 The situation in Gujarat is no better. The electricity shortage in the state is to the tune of 12.7 per cent. While the power availability is 4,766 million units, the requirement is 5,459 million units, according to figures available for April. 

 In Uttar Pradesh, the shortfall is almost 18 per cent with a requirement-availability gap of over 800 million units. 

 A region-wise comparison shows that the highly industrialised western region has been the worst hit. Energy deficit was 16.7 per cent in April ? power available was 15,883 million units against the required 19,065 million units.

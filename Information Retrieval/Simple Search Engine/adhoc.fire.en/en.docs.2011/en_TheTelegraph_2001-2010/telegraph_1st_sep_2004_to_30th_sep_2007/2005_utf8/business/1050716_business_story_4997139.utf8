 Mumbai realty bubble set to burst

 Parekh: Home truths

 Mumbai, July 15: Is the real estate bubble ready to burst? 

 Even as developers place astronomical bids for a piece of land in Mumbai, there are others who warn that the rates are unsustainable.

 I see some correction. These rates are unsustainable, says Deepak Parekh, chairman of Housing Development Finance Corporation.

 We are not like the US and Japan. We are a poor country, Parekh added. 

 The real estate market in Mumbai has been on a high in the recent months. Developers like DLF-Akruti Nirman SPV made waves in the industry when they snapped up a 19- acre property for Rs 702 crore.

 Parekh feels lease rentals of Rs 60-80 per square feet in the city for business process outsourcing outfits (BPO) is expensive compared with other competing cities.

 Cities like Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore offer lease rentals of Rs 20-30 per square feet, he added.

 To sustain operations in the commercial capital would put pressure on a BPOs profit margins. All of them would look outside, he added.

 Parekh referred to the recent high court judgment which could release more than 15 crore square feet of mill land. The additional supply of land will help soften prices in Mumbai.

 The National Textile Corporation has earned almost Rs 1,158 crore from the sale of three properties.

 Indiabulls, an internet brokerage, branched into real estate development when it bid successfully for Jupiter Mills in Central Mumbai recently. Analysts had predicted that its investment would gain over Rs 205 crore after a property valuation.

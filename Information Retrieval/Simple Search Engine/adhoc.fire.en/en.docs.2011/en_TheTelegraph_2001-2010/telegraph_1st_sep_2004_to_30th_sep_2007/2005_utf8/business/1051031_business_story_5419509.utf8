 Back to basics

 New Delhi, Oct. 30: Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) is betting big on life sciences and therapeutic manufacturing, particularly in the fields of stem cells and molecular genetics.

 Sources told The Telegraph that Reliance Life Sciences ? a group company of RIL ? is setting up a manufacturing facility for recombinant proteins and cell therapies in Navi Mumbai. 

 The facility is expected to be commissioned by mid-2006.

 Company officials were unwilling to commit on the amount that Reliance Life Sciences will pump in new research facilities. It is, however, believed that the investment could top Rs 1500 crore over the next three years to set up a series of centres dedicated to high-end research and manufacture.

 The laboratories will focus on areas of embryonic and haematopoietic stem cells, skin and tissue engineering, molecular diagnostics, monoclonal antibodies, plant tissue culture, biofuels and biochemicals.

 The company has also set up an animal house to conduct regulatory toxicology and pre-clinical efficacy studies for cell-based therapies, proteins and small molecules.

 Sources said this laboratory focused on genetic characterisation of animals to treat diseases like Parkinsons, Alzheimers, diabetes and obesity.

 The company is also focusing on therapies in the treatment of thalassemia, leukaemia and sickle cell anaemia through stem-cell research, which is an adjunct for aggressive chemotherapy.

 The company has already set up a stem cell-enriched umbilical cord blood repository. The repository offers a sibling donor programme as well as storage of stem cells from umbilical cord blood from voluntary donors.

 Sources said the proposed facility for recombinant therapeutic proteins in Navi Mumbai will also have provision for contract manufacturing and secondary research.

 In addition, two associate companies of Reliance Life Sciences ? Reliance Clinical Research Services and Reliance Research and Development Services ? are also on an expansion mode.

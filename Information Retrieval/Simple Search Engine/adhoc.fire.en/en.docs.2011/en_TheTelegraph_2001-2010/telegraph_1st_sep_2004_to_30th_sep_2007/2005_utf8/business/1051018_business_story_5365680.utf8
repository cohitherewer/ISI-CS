 Shanghai, Oct. 17 (PTI): India is ready to play an ?active? role in promoting Asian economic integration and is keen to co-operate with China in achieving the goal, finance minister P. Chidambaram said here today.

 ?India?s approach towards Asian integration and its relations with the rest of the continent are increasingly an important element of our foreign policy,? the minister said in his inaugural speech at the third Made in India show organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) here. 

 ?We look forward to working with China towards these goals,? he said while pointing out that India first propagated the idea and concept of an ?Asian economic community? in September 2003.

 He stressed that Asian economies, especially India and China, seem posed to provide the thrust necessary for continued economic growth in the 21st century.

 ?India and China are two of the most important contributors to the political and economic dynamics of this continent, as also of the world,? Chidambaram said. He echoed CII president Y.C. Deveshwar?s forecast that India-China bilateral trade, which has crossed the $12.2 billion-mark during the first eight months of 2005, could even touch $20 billion by the year-end. ?There is ample opportunity and space in the international economy for both our growing economies,? the finance minister said.

 Chidambaram, however, stressed that both the countries need to examine closely the narrow composition of the trade basket and the insufficient use of each other?s comparative advantages. ?For sustainable high volumes, diversification of the trade basket is not only important but imperative,? he said while suggesting that India and China should look into agriculture, dairy industry, food processing, auto components, pharmaceuticals, machine tools and information technology.

 The ?Made in India? show is a CII effort to help trade between the two countries grow. ?The shows are a reflection of CII?s commitment to enhance commercial relations with China,? Y.C. Deveshwar, president, CII said. He noted that the bilateral trade between the two nations was growing exponentially in recent years. ?If such rates can be maintained, the target of $20 billion might be achieved this year itself.?

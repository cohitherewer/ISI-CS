 SBI rules out lending rate cut for now

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Purwar: Focused

 Hyderabad, Aug. 6: State Bank of India chairman A. K. Purwar today indicated that domestic lending rates are unlikely to go down in the near future.

 According to Purwar, global uncertainties, including the rise in crude prices and the scenario in the European and American markets, were unlikely to affect the domestic market in the short run.

 ?Interest rates have been cut in the UK but there is an upswing in US lending rates,? Purwar said while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a national conference on micro-finance organised by the Indian School of Business here.

 ?Frankly speaking I would take the stance that in the short term interest rates will remain stable,? he said.

 ?You can safely say that interest rates will not go down in the short run. But it will be very difficult to predict the medium and long-term rates, he said. 

 In its pursuit to become a top financial company globally, SBI was also looking at banks in Africa and Asia for acquisitions, the chairman said.

 Scheme for expats

 SBI is planning new deposit, insurance and mutual fund products for expatriate Indians to retain some proceeds from a deposit maturing in November.

 Purwar said the plan to woo back some of the $5.5 billion that expatriates had deposited in the India Millennium Deposits (IMD) in 2000, was mainly intended to help raise funds for the bank?s foreign operations.

 ?We have a number of foreign offices now and require funds for our commercial operations,? Purwar said. 

 ?Our overseas offices will come out with some products focusing on the IMD redemptions. In addition, our subsidiaries SBI Life and SBI Mutual Fund are coming out with products to capture some of the redemption proceeds.?

 SBI has 52 offices in 34 countries, in addition to more than 9,000 branches spread across India.

 SBI launched the scheme in 2000 to help shore up foreign exchange reserves, at a time when rising global oil prices and a slowdown in foreign capital inflows were whittling down the country?s reserves and putting pressure on the Indian rupee.

 Forex reserves in Asias third-largest economy have steadily risen in the past five years.

 The SBI chairman said that the first-quarter results of the bank were very good. ?We have succeeded in generating good deal of profits. We are confident producing good results in the second quarter also. 

 He said SBI would take a view on tier-II capital in September which we tentatively considering to be of the order of Rs 2000-3000 crore .

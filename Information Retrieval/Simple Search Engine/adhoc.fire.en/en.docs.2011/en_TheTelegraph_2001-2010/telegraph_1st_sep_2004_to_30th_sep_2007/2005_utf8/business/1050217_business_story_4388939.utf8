 Mumbai, Feb. 16: Allahabad Bank today filed a draft red herring prospectus for its second public issue of shares with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

 Analysts expect the bank to raise Rs 700-750 crore from the offering, which will bring down the government stake to 55.2 per cent from the existing 71.6 per cent.

 Senior bank officials said money from the issue will be invested in expansion and boosting capital to levels required by the more stringent Basel II norms. If the funds are used this way, the capital adequacy ratio will go up.

 A release issued today by Allahabad Bank, the eighth-largest in the country, said 10 crore shares will be put on the block in a flotation where the premium will be decided through a book-building process. The bank has reserved 1 crore shares for employees and an equal number for individuals who already own its stock.

 Of the 8 crore shares that remain, 4 crore will go to institutions on a discretionary basis, 2 crore to non-institutional buyers and just as many to first-time retail investors. SBI Capital Markets Ltd, DSP Merrill Lynch Pvt Ltd, ICICI Securities Ltd, JM Morgan Stanley Pvt Ltd and Kotak Mahindra Capital Company Ltd are lead managers to the Calcutta-based bank?s issue.

 The Allahabad Bank filing comes days after Bank of Baroda secured government approval for a second offer of 71 million shares. Dena Bank raised more than Rs 200 crore from a recent, highly successful flotation. 

 The Delhi-based Punjab National Bank is also hitting the market with an issue that opens on March 7. Oriental Bank of Commerce and Bank of India are likely to follow suit.

 Allahabad Bank reported a 62 per cent leap in net profit at Rs 159.25 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2004. Total income grew over 10 per cent to Rs 897.80 crore from Rs 814.03 crore.

 Oracle third-quarter net drops

 San Francisco, March 23 (Reuters): Oracle Corp, the second-biggest software firm, on Tuesday posted a 15 per cent drop in quarterly net profit due to charges related to its $10.6-billion purchase of PeopleSoft. The net profit, excluding charges, was ahead of the average Wall Street expectation, and the company raised its full-year profit forecast, but shares fell about 2 per cent as revenue missed analysts? targets and on what some analysts called disappointing software application sales.

 Oracle co-president and interim CFO Safra Catz said Oracle expected total costs related to PeopleSoft to be about $611 million. She added that Oracle expected a restructuring of PeopleSoft to be completed in the next six months.

 Net income for the third quarter ended February 28 fell to $540 million from $635 million a year ago. Revenue rose to $2.95 billion from $2.51 billion. Excluding items, Oracle reported third-quarter earnings of 16 cents a share.

 Analysts said Oracle?s results were healthy, but were disappointed with the performance of its software applications, traditionally a small part of its business, but a primary driver behind Oracle?s move to buy software makers PeopleSoft and Retek. ?For those concerned about the integration of PeopleSoft and the health of Oracle?s applications business, these results will not get the monkey off their back,? said Piper Jaffray analyst Tad Piper.

 Govt readies cheap power tariff proposal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sayeed: Energy for all

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: The Union power ministry will approach the cabinet to seek approval for a new tariff policy that aims to supply electricity to consumers at Rs 2 to Rs 2.20 per unit against the existing average rate of Rs 4 per unit.

 The policy also aims to promote competitive bidding among power companies in generation, transmission and distribution.

 The power ministry is confident that the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and the state electricity regulatory commissions will have enough room to promote competition and maintain lower tariff for consumers.

 Power minister P. M. Sayeed said, ?The companies have achieved financial closure for about 5000 megawatt of power during the last one year and we expect that by March 2005 projects with a potential to generate 14,000 MW of power at a cost of Rs 50,000 crore would achieve financial closure.?

 ?This is a good enough indication that the availability of power will not be a problem and it can be supplied at Rs 2 to 2.20 per unit. Projects that can offer only this tariff will be cleared,? he added.

 The country would need an investment of Rs 9,00,000 crore by 2012 to finance generation, transmission, distribution and rural electrification projects, he said.

 Unveiling the National Electricity Policy, cleared by the cabinet on Wednesday, he said, ?Public sector investments, both by the Centre and state governments, will have to be stepped up and a sizeable part of these investments will need to be brought in from the private sector.?

 Sayeed promised to offer adequate returns on investments to attract private investors. ?Return on investment will need to be provided on a par with, if not preference to, investment opportunities in other sectors. We have to maintain a balance between returns to private investors and consumers? interests.?

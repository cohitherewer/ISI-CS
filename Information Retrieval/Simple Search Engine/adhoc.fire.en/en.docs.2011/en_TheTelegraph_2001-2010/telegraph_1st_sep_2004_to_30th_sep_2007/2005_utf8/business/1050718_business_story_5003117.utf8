 Banks are topping their plain vanilla deposit and savings schemes with the cherry of a life cover or personal accident insurance. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay checks out what?s on offer

 Thirty-two-year-old Sarit Panda is scouting around for a savings option that will swell his kitty by another Rs 3 to 4 lakh so that his family can feel secure in the unfortunate event of his premature death. 

 It may sound a little morbid to contemplate one?s early transition to those Elysian Fields, but it?s prudent to take care of any eventuality. 

 Panda despairs. His monthly take-home pay is a piffle: just Rs 12,000 and he could at best sock away Rs 3000 a month. That?s when he learnt about a savings product of Union Bank of India that suited his needs and his pocket. The bank has a recurring deposit scheme, called the Union Insured Recurring Deposit Scheme, which comes with a life insurance cover equivalent to the maturity value of the deposit account. 

 On a monthly recurring deposit of Rs 3,000 for seven years, the scheme offers Panda a life insurance cover of about Rs 3,50,000, payable to his nominee in case he dies within the deposit term of seven years. But if Panda survives the seven-year term, the bank will deduct Rs 9,408 as the cost towards insurance premium from the amount payable to him on maturity. 

 Panda calculates that the premium cost is too low compared with his life risk. He opens a recurring deposit account with the bank. Union Bank also offers its Union Suraksha savings deposit scheme, which carries a life insurance element. 

 The Suraksha scheme, however, offers a fixed sum assured of Rs 1 lakh irrespective of the amount in the deposit account; the premium cost of this scheme varies with the age of the depositor. Depositors above 18 years and below 55 years can avail of the Rs 1 lakh life cover at a yearly premium between Rs 249 and Rs 1020, depending on the age. 

 In the Suraksha scheme, the nominee of the deposit account holder gets Rs 1 lakh plus the amount accrued in the savings account in case of death of the depositor (provided the account is running till that time).

 Union Bank of India is not the only one offering a life insurance cover with its various deposit products ? savings, recurring or fixed. Corporation Bank, Allahabad Bank, Andhra Bank and United Bank of India also offer such integrated products in partnership with one or the other insurer in the country. Others like Dena Bank are about to announce their offerings soon. 

 While Union Bank offers the life insurance cover on its recurring and savings deposit products in partnership with HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company, Corporation Bank and Allahabad Bank have tied up with Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) for their offerings. 

 Corporation Banks New Corp Jeevan Raksha and Allahabad Banks Al Ayushman Bima Yojana are similar to Union Banks Suraksha scheme and offer the same life cover of Rs 1 lakh. However, the annual premium cost in case of Corporation Bank and Allahabad Bank schemes are the same and are lower than Union Banks. 

 ?Our premium cost is higher because the premium cost of HDFC Standard Life (for the particular group term assurance product) is higher than that of LIC,? said a Union Bank official. He added, ?However, life insurance is an add-on to bank deposits and it is optional to depositors.? 

 Andhra Bank and United Bank of India have a slightly different bait: they offer a personal accident cover instead of a life insurance cover from a general insurance company. Andhra Bank has a tie-up with National Insurance Company, while United Bank of India, which has just started offering insurance cover, has partnered with Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company. 

 Andhra Bank has insurance-linked current and savings account products. The personal accident cover is Rs 1 lakh for the current account holders, while it is Rs 25,000 for those having Abhaya savings accounts. However, there is an Abhaya Gold savings bank account with a personal accident cover of Rs 1 lakh. The annual premium is Rs 50 and Rs 12 based on the insurance cover.

 United Bank of India offers a sum assured of Rs 1 lakh for accidental death and Rs 1.25 lakh in case of permanent disability for an annual premium of Rs 13 only. Depositors with multiple accounts have the option to have separate coverage in respect of each account. For example, a depositor with three accounts can opt for a total coverage of Rs 3 lakh against accidental death and pay an annual premium of Rs 39. 

 The user-friendly features of these schemes are that any depositor, existing or new, of the bank can opt for the insurance cover. For this, one just needs to fill up a consent form declaring that one is in good health. Thats all. 

 The claim settlement is also hassle-free. The nominee of the bank account holder should approach the bank instead of the insurer concerned for a claim. The bank then takes up the settlement procedure with the insurer, which sends the money to the bank itself.

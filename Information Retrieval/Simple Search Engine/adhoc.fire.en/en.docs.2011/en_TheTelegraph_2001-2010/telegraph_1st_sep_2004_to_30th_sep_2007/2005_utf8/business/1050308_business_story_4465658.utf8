 Mallya: Truce times

 New Delhi, March 7: The battle for control of Herbertsons Ltd between liquor giant Vijay Mallya?s United Breweries Ltd and Kishore Chhabria ended today with the Supreme Court approving their final settlement deed submitted during the proceedings.

 Market regulator Sebi had given its approval to the agreement between Mallya and Chhabria.

 Under the terms of the settlement, Mallya-owned UB will buy 46,72,791 shares in Herbertsons owned by entities controlled by Kishore Chhabria and his uncle M. D. Chhabria for a consideration of Rs 131.16 crore.

 As soon as hearings began today, both the parties contesting a fierce legal battle over control of Herbertsons Ltd told the Supreme Court that they had reached an out of court settlement that had the approval of the market regulator. The court cleared the scheme.

 The agreement deed was submitted to a bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde, S. B. Sinha and B. N. Srikrishna, which took it on record, and disposed of the case in terms of the agreement approved by Sebi.

 Under the agreement, the stock transaction would be put through a recognised stock exchange and registered member of that stock exchange appointed jointly by Mallya and Chhabria.

 The two parties will share equally the cost of the securities transaction tax payable on the deal. Vendors will also be entitled to the dividend declared (which were not actually paid) for the eight financial years between 1996 and 2004.

 The agreement says the shareholders who had offered their shares in response to the open offers by the two parties in the past would be paid the difference if the ?delisting price works out higher than the open offer price?.

 ?In case the offer made by the purchaser under delisting guidelines fails, the purchaser (or UB) shall bring back the public shareholding in the company to the minimum limits specified under the listing agreement within a period of six months,? the pact said.

 Dust settles on ONGC showdown

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi Sept. 14: The crisis sparked by the faceoff between Oil and Natural Gas Corp chairman Subir Raha and the director-general of hydrocarbons (DGH) V.K. Sibal may have blown over ? at least for now.

 Santosh Mohan Dev, Union minister for heavy industries, today said no more government directors can be appointed on the ONGC board.

 The petroleum ministry had initiated a move to foist Sibal and one other person on the ONGC board as government nominees. 

 The oil firm already has two officials from the petroleum ministry on the board representing the government. But the ministry now appears to have decided not to force the issue at the ONGC board meeting on September 21 after Raha came up with a petulant threat to resign.

 Dev confirmed today that no more government directors could be appointed. Sibal can still come in if one of the other directors steps down, but the petroleum ministry may not take such a precipitate step at this stage. 

 Under the existing rules, the maximum number of government directors on the board of a public sector undertaking has to be one-sixth of the total strength of the board or two, whichever is lower.

 Raha and Sibal have been at loggerheads for some time with the DGH accusing Raha of announcing oil and gas discoveries without having them first verified, leading to a surge in ONGCs stock price.

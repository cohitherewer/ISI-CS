 Reliance files at registrar?s finger tips

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 15: The Registrar of Companies is fielding queries from parliamentarians regarding Reliance, even as it completes its due diligence of putting the files of the group?s investment companies in order.

 Anil Ambani, vice-chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, had tried hard to get the regulators investigate his company.

 Anil had submitted a 500-page tome on the non-compliance of high standards of corporate governance, transparency and disclosures in the company headed by Mukesh, his elder brother.

 The report was submitted to the board committee on corporate governance. The committee was set up after the board meeting on December 27, 2004. It is headed by independent directors of the RIL board, namely Yogesh P Trivedi, D V Kapur and M P Modi. 

 It was set up after revelations that a group of investment companies was being used to invest in Reliance Infocomm and there were different scales of measurement while charging premium from RIL and issuing shares on a par to select individuals. 

 The RoC, which maintains the files of corporate entities, was caught napping initially when the Ambani ownership issues took centrestage. Sources said it has now got its act together and is ready with all the documents pertaining to the intricate web of investment companies that own Reliance Industries and its associates. 

 ?We have updated and kept all the files in one location,? a RoC source said. The office has been fielding queries from the Parliament secretariat as a few members of Parliament have raised questions in the current session. 

 RoC sources said, ?We have been clearly told by our seniors not to probe deeper, but keep the files up-to-date, which we have done.?

 Some months ago, Union finance minister P. Chidambaram had brushed away the issues raised by Anil and instead advised restraint to the warring brothers. At the Rotunda hall in the Bombay Stock Exchange, he said he had advised the two brothers to settle their differences ?within the four walls of their house in Sea Wind?. 

 The finance minister added that the government did not have any view on the Reliance group.

 According to RoC sources, some of the papers in the files were missing. ?But we have located those and in some cases we have obtained some of the missing documents from the companies themselves,? sources added.

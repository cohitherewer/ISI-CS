 Brakes on free pricing of auto covers

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 7: Car owners will not have the benefit of free pricing while choosing motor insurance.

 Detariffication of motor insurance, scheduled from April 2005, has been put on hold by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).

 ?We are taking a re-look at the detariffication of the motor insurance segment and are examining whether to do it at all,? said IRDA chairman C. S. Rao. He was speaking at a conference on India?s insurance sector organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce.

 The proposal was to detariff the own-damage portion of motor insurance leaving the third-party liability, which is mandatory under law, untouched. However, Rao said the regulator had received a feedback from the general insurance industry requesting it to either detariff the entire motor vehicle insurance sector, both own-damage and third party, or stop detariffing altogether as it would be a difficult proposition to adopt piecemeal detariffing.

 ?We shall meet the council of General Insurance Corporation (GIC) for more views on detariffing,? said Rao.

 Detariffing the sector would help free pricing as determined by market forces. The authority was considering it to increase the exposure of private sector companies in motor insurance.

 However, Rao added that IRDA is considering the possibility to detariff other non-life sectors such as marine, hull, householder and shopkeeper, club and restaurant segments. However, the authority has to ensure that the underwriting norms are proper to ensure fair play and safeguard consumers? interests.

 ?We have also authorised the Tariff Advisory Committee (TAC) to take a look at the whole detariffing process,? said Rao.

 Detariffing the entire motor insurance sector would have resulted in lower tariffs in low claims sectors, especially in cars and personal transport. However, in the case of high claims segments, tariffs would have steeply increased, especially in third party covers.

 Thus, IRDA was considering a proposal to set up a motor pool for the third party insurance claims once the own-damage component was detariffed. However, that decision will also be deferred now as the process of detariffing has been put on the backburner.

 Motor insurance is a losing proposition with claims-to-premiums ratio of over 150 per cent. As a result, private insurers are reluctant to enter.

 Cabinet defers real estate FDI proposal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nath: Reality bites

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: The cabinet today deferred proposals to relax norms for foreign investment in the realty sector.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath said the proposal to relax the minimum floor ceiling for foreign investment in realty was deferred because of elections in Bihar and Jharkhand. However, sources said opposition within the cabinet as well as fears of a Left backlash on the issue had stalled the move.

 The government wants to relax norms, which stipulate that foreign direct investments be allowed only in townships spread over at least 100 acres of land and instead change it to a minimum area of 25 acres. The changes could also see FDI being allowed in commercial buildings with a floor area of 50,000 square feet.

 The problem with such a relaxed norm is that it would mean that FDI would be allowed into virtually every second commercial building in India ? a move that could add fire to the already skyrocketing prices of commercial property in urban India.

 Finance ministry officials said one of the critical elements of the East Asia crash of the 1990s was spiralling property prices fuelled by an onrush of speculative foreign investment in local commercial complexes.

 Most economists have said since then that India should be extremely cautious about allowing similar speculative drives here.

 The Left has not yet been consulted and many ministers fear that a decision on such a sensitive issue without prior consultation could trigger off another controversy.

 Sections within the cabinet, which support diluting the norms, however, argue that such a move will ensure better and speedier development of urban infrastructure and bring in high tech construction knowhow. 

 They also said integrated townships of 100 acres are difficult to build near the main urban areas of Delhi and Mumbai as land is scarce and costly in these two cities.

 Domestic chambers have been lending their voices to the move to allow FDI into smaller townships and commercial buildings. 

 Ficci feels ?dynamic developers and foreign and domestic investors? can earn good returns on investment to boost real estate development and housing.

 The chamber is for allowing foreign companies to purchase office buildings and high-end condominiums for rental purposes.

 Power plan

 The government today approved the new ?rural electricity infrastructure and household electrification? scheme, which will provide free single-point connection to households below poverty line and a decentralised power distribution and supply system. The existing scheme of accelerated electrification of 1 lakh villages and 1 crore households will be replaced by the new scheme in which the minimum need programme for rural electrification will be merged.

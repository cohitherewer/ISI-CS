 MphasiS stumbles in IT parade

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 11: The infotech sector kicked off its earnings reports for the third quarter with a stutter as MphasiS BFL ? the Bangalore-based software and services company ? reported a 5.6 per cent drop in its consolidated third-quarter net profit at Rs 26.8 crore from Rs 28.5 crore in the year-ago period.

 Revenues rose 27 per cent to Rs 191 crore from Rs 148.6 crore in the year-ago period. 

 Cost of revenue rose 28 per cent from a year earlier, largely due to salary increases, a higher number of employees and operational expansion. 

 ?Mathematically, it is almost inevitable that full-year earnings and revenue guidance would be missed,? chairman Jerry Rao said. He blamed the weak performance on disappointment from its IT services business. 

 Shares of MphasiS, which sells both software and business process outsourcing (BPO) services, fell 4.7 per cent to Rs 262.40. 

 ?This quarter has been an issue, particularly on the IT services side. BPO continues to chug along very well,? Rao told a television channel. ?Looking forward, we feel quite good. We just have to take this on the chin and carry on with life.?

 Bangalore-based MphasiS also said the rupee appreciation had led to a foreign exchange loss of Rs 32 lakh, compared with a Rs 6.1-crore gain in the same quarter a year earlier. Compared with the preceding quarter to September, MphasiS? IT revenues fell 4 per cent, while BPO revenues rose 5 per cent. He said it was more realistic to expect profit growth in the range of 25-30 per cent instead of 30-35 per cent forecast earlier. 

 Chief financial officer Ravi Ramu said the company was likely to close the year with Rs 125 crore in net profit and revenues in excess of Rs 750 crore. MphasiS said its BPO business, now with 33 clients, grew 54 per cent year on year with revenue of Rs 74.48 crore in the last quarter. 

 The new clients include a large global insurance group, an entertainment conglomerate, a software securities products company, one of the largest paper producers in Australia, a large credit card issuer for its Asia-Pacific operations and a global rating agency.

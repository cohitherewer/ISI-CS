 Kalam roadmap for 12% growth

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today urged India Inc to target a growth of 10-12 per cent to make the country a developed nation by 2020.

 The President identified a five-point roadmap to achieve this growth rate at the 100th annual general meeting of PHDCCI.

 To meet the needs of 1 billion people, we have identified five areas for integrated action. These are agriculture and food processing, reliable and quality infrastructure, education and healthcare, information and communication technology and development of strategic sectors, said Kalam.

 He outlined a development model with emphasis on FDI flow, information technology in rural areas, a comprehensive energy security programme and ways to boost agriculture.

 Banks will play an important role in the new scheme of things. 

 Resurgence of venture capital is also needed to generate new enterprises.

 We need creative leaders. Creative leadership means exercising the vision to change the traditional role from the commander to the coach, manager to mentor, from director to delegator and from one who demands respect to one who facilitates self-respect, Kalam said.

 Stating that FIIs find investing in India attractive, Kalam pointed to a new trend in the economy ? an increasing number of domestic companies investing abroad and starting new ventures.

 Indian FDI in London was second only to the United States and Indian projects in Europe have increased from just five to 119 during the period from 1997 to 2004, the President said, quoting from the report titled From the Ganges to the Thames.

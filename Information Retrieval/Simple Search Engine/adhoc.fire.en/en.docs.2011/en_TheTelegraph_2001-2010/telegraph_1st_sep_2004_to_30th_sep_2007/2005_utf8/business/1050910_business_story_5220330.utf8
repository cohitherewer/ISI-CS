 New Delhi, Sept. 9: Ford Motor India today rolled out a special edition of the Endeavour model, priced between Rs 14.5 and 15.39 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).

 With the new Endeavour, Ford Motor India, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford Motor Company, expects to retain its market share in the sports-utility vehicles (SUV) segment.

 The latest SUV will be a regular Endeavour. However, it has been termed special edition because of the colour it will be available in, said V. Sivaramakrishnan, vice-president, sales and marketing, Ford Motor India.

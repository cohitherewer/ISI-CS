 Compensation package eludes IBP

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, April 23: The Centre has rejected IBP?s plea for a special compensation package to keep it out of the red. 

 The company will receive Rs 44 crore according to the subsidy-sharing formula worked out by the petroleum ministry for the fourth quarter. For the whole of 2004-05, the company will get Rs 180 crore. 

 IBP had sought Rs 350 crore as compensation, arguing that it suffered most among the state-run oil companies since retail prices of petrol, diesel, kerosene and cooking gas were not commensurately raised with the increase in global crude rates.

 In the absence of such a package, the company might just notch up a meagre profit or even suffer a marginal loss in 2004-05 in its last year of independent existence. IBP, which is going to be merged with parent Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), had declared a profit of Rs 214.66 crore in 2003-04. 

 However, the biggest losers are going to be the shareholders. The company is certainly going to skip dividends this time. It had paid out a hefty dividend of 350 per cent in 2003-04.

 In the last quarter, the company managed to offset most of the loss in the first nine months. 

 However, the situation has worsened in April. The price of the Indian basket of imported crude crossed $50 in this month, which translated into a Rs 120-crore loss for IBP.

 In the first nine months of 2004-05, IBP had suffered a loss of Rs 167.55 crore compared with Rs 121.12 crore in the corresponding period last year. 

 IBP?s situation is unique within the oil industry as it is the only oil marketing company that does not have a refinery.

 Companies like IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) have also suffered under-recoveries but refining gains have offset their marketing losses.

 For the full year, IBP?s under-recoveries were about Rs 540 crore, of which Rs 340 crore was on account of kerosene and cooking gas and the remaining Rs 200 crore was due to petrol and diesel. 

 According to the subsidy-sharing formula, three upstream companies ? Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Gail and Oil India Ltd ? picked up a third of the under-recovery on account of kerosene and cooking gas.

 Given IBP?s precarious condition, the company had sought full compensation of its loss instead of the established formula of sharing one-third of the under recovery.

 However, IBP?s physical performance continues to be robust. The company added 550 retail outlets last year to take the tally to 3300. 

 Observers feel merger with IOC could be the only option to save IBP from slipping into the red. Oil marketing operations will continue to suffer losses since refining companies are allowed to charge at the import parity price, while the retail price is government-regulated. Once IBP is merged with IOC, it will become a division of a company that has refining operations.

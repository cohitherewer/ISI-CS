 Citigroup to cut 1000 jobs

 Workout time 

 The cuts will affect about 2 per cent to 3 per cent of the unit?s 48,000 employees worldwide, and are expected at all levels of the unit, the person said. New York-based Citigroup is the world?s largest financial services company. 

 Chief executive Charles Prince is trying to cut expenses and exit businesses not focused on consumer or corporate banking, after a year when costs rose by one-third. He is moving away from predecessor and mentor Sanford ?Sandy? Weill?s vision of creating a one-stop financial supermarket. 

 ?Prince and the board are focused on making money and having the most profitable business, not necessarily the most complete,? said Michael Holland, the founder of Holland amp; Co. in New York. ?Anything that makes sense, including terminations, are probably all on the table.?

 Citigroup spokeswoman Christina Pretto said ?we are making limited staff reductions, consistent with two fundamental objectives: keeping expenses low while continuing to invest in areas where we see growth opportunities.? She declined to say how many jobs are being cut. 

 Last week, Deutsche Bank AG said it will also cut some investment banking jobs. In contrast, Bank of America Corp., which is spending $675 million to expand its smaller investment bank, is adding jobs. 

 The Citigroup cuts come amid a separate announcement on Friday that the bank is streamlining its capital markets funding business, which helps fund day-to-day operations and business growth, and simplifying its legal structure. 

 ?Citigroup is trying to figure out where to generate efficiencies to improve profit, which is what we as shareholders expect,? said Jim Lyon, who helps invest more than $450 million at Oakwood Capital Management in Los Angeles.

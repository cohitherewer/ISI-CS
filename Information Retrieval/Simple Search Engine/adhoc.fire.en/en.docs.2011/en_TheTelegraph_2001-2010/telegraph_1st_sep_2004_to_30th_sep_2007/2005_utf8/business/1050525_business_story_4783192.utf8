 IOC stares steep loss in the face

 Bad turn

 New Delhi, May 24: Indian Oil Corporation is headed for a net loss of Rs 600 crore during the first quarter of the current financial year given the existing prices of petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene and the prevailing international rates of crude, a senior company official said today. 

 This is the first time that the Fortune 500 company will be suffering a loss. Similarly, Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum and IBP are also set to plunge into the red.

 The increase in excise duty on petrol and diesel and the additional 50 paise road cess on the two fuels have not been passed on to consumers, resulting in an increase in the burden on oil companies by Rs 2.50 per litre on petrol and Rs 1.35 per litre on diesel. 

 The national oil companies managed to show profits for the last financial year ended March 31 largely due to high refinery margins that have offset marketing losses. 

 However, senior oil marketing officials state that even refining margins have turned negative during the current fiscal. 

 We estimate a revenue loss of Rs 3,000 crore in the first quarter (April-June) on petrol and diesel sales and a slightly lesser amount on LPG and kerosene, the official said. 

 Oil companies have been asked to keep the prices of diesel and petrol on hold since November despite crude prices shooting up by 25 per cent. Crude oil accounts for as much as 90 per cent of the cost of production for petroleum goods and there is little that oil majors can do to cut costs.

 According to sources, the petroleum ministry has put the ball in the finance ministrys court by scaling down its demand for an increase in petrol and diesel prices to Rs 2.50 per litre and Rs 1.30 per litre, respectively. This essentially adds up to the rise in excise duty and additional road cess introduced in the budget.

 The petroleum ministry is reported to have taken the stand that oil companies will shoulder the burden of an increase in oil prices. However, the taxes and the extra cost of 25 to 30 paise per litre incurred in supplying better quality Euro II and Euro III fuels will be passed on to consumers.

 The petroleum ministry has scaled down its demand of an over Rs 4 per litre hike in the two transport fuels, making it clear that it is willing to bear its share of the burden to shield consumers. But the finance ministry would have to do its part to hold prices in check. The excise and cess have always been borne by consumers and it is not normal for oil companies to bear these levies.

 Since the Left has taken a firm stand against any price increase, the petroleum ministrys proposal is bound to increase pressure on finance minister P. Chidambaram to roll back the hike in excise and the road cess.

 IRDA cracks the whip

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 5: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has removed K. H. Vachha, senior partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers, from the panel of auditors with the authority.

 According to a notice dated January 20, 2005, which is available on the website of IRDA, the decision has been taken based on a list of names provided by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) who have been found guilty of misconduct. 

 It means one more regulator is against the company, although this time it is a specific partner.

 ICAI officials explained that the institute prepares a list of members found guilty of misconduct and sends them regularly to the regulators. ?It is the discretion of the authority to take a decision based on the gravity of the misconduct,? the official said. 

 At ICAI, the punishment for misconduct can be from a reprimand to cancellation of registration for life, again depending on the gravity of it. However, ICAI refused to divulge the actual charges against Vachha.

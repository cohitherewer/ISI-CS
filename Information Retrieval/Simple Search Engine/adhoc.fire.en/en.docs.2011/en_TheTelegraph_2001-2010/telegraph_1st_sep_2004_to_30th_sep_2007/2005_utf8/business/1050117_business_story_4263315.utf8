 Reliance valuation in 3 weeks

 New Delhi, Jan. 16 (PTI): The process of valuation of the Ambani business empire is likely to be completed in the next three weeks. The figures could lay the basis for a blueprint to end the family feud that has hurt the Reliance group, sources familiar with the exercise said today. 

 ICICI Bank chairman and a friend of the Ambanis, K. V. Kamath, is doing the valuation following a family conclave in Mumbai on December 28 at which the feuding brothers ? RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani and vice-chairman Anil Ambani ? were present along with their mother Kokilaben and their two sisters Dipti and Neena. 

 Sources close to the Anil camp said it was agreed at the meeting that Kamath would carry out valuation of the Reliance group, estimated to be worth between Rs 90,000 crore and Rs 100,000 crore. 

 Thereafter, a formula for ?legal split? between the brothers would be worked out.

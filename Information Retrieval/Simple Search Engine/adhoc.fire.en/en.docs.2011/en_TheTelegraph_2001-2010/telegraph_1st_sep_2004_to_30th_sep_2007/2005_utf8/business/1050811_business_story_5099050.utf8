 Rabo India to offer NPA recast package

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Aug. 10: Rabo India Finance, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rabobank Netherlands, will restructure non-performing assets (NPA) of domestic companies. This new area of business will help Rabo India increase its fee-based income.

 Under the NPA restructuring package worked out by Rabo India, companies will get overseas funds for fresh equity infusion. This is not available under the debt restructuring packages offered by lending institutions, which ask the promoter to inject fresh equity. They do not arrange funds for the promoter.

 Talking to The Telegraph, Rabo India chief executive officer Sanjiv Bhasin said, This is a new line of activity for us. We have already carried out the restructuring for Kopran, a pharmaceutical company. We have roped in overseas funds, who have provided debts to the promoter as part of the fresh equity infusion process.

 Rabo India, on its part, gets 2-3 per cent of the total debt restructured as a fee for the entire exercise.

 We are not looking at many companies at a time. We are taking up three to four firms as the entire exercise involves intensive working. We have to make the lenders as well as the promoters agree to a certain package and find out overseas investors. However, we try to complete a deal within five to six months, Bhasin added.

 Rabo India has also received the licence to undertake merchant banking activities. However, it will not be an aggressive player in the IPO market as it requires a lot of capital to set up a network to handle public issues.

 We will help in merger and acquisitions of companies. While doing so, if it is required to help the firm float a public issue, we will do so, said Bhasin.

 Rabo India is also planning to float a $50-million private equity fund for the food processing sector. It will be launched in this calendar year.

 We may consider a similar fund for the life sciences or biotechnology sector in the future, he said.

 Rabo India, which has an expertise in food and agri-business, has been identified by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) to develop feasible models for modern markets and selling horticultural produce on the lines of the Dutch auction system for Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta and Bangalore.

 In addition to developing a profitable, sustainable model, the task involved devising means to reduce supply chain inefficiencies such as multiple-level interference.

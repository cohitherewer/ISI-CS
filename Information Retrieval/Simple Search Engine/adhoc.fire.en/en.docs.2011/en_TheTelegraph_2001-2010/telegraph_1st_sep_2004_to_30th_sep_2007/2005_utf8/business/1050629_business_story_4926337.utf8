 Samsung mobile buzz gets louder

 M. RAJENDRAN

 New Delhi, June 28: Samsung India Electronics Ltd aims to increase its market share of mobile phones based on the GSM technology to 14 per cent from 8 per cent by the year-end and 30 per cent by 2007.

 The market share of India operations at 14 per cent will be on a par with that held globally by Samsung.

 Hyunchul Ryu, director (hand-held phone business) Southeast Asia, Samsung India, said, We are placed second with a 14 per cent market share in GSM mobile phones globally. We aim to raise our market share in India to the same level. The next target is to capture 30 per cent of the market by 2007.

 The company will focus on innovation and customisation to improve its market share. Samsung India will launch quadband phones in September and 17 GSM mobile models for the entry-level and high-end customers.

 Quadband phones help a subscriber get connected where four different frequency bands are used by operators. 

 Currently in India, GSM operators offer services in two bands ? 900 and 1800. But while travelling abroad, a subscriber can get connected to two more frequency bands used by GSM operators in that country. Motorola and Nokia already have similar phones in their stables.

 The company, which also sells mobile phones based on code division multiple access (CDMA) technology, feels that handsets will drive growth with government thrust on wireless services. 

 Of the total mobiles phones sold by the company last year, 60 per cent were based on the GSM technology the rest were CDMA phones.

 On the growing demand of style and model variety, Ryu said India is slowly but steadily catching up with the trend in Europe to move from candy bar mobile handsets to clamshell phones.

 The clamshell phones will have a greater acceptance in India soon. We sold 7000 flip phones in January and by the end of this month we would have sold 15,000. By July end, we have set a target to sell 25,000 mobile phones, said Ryu.

 Samsung India also plans to launch third generation (3G) mobile phones. But the company will wait for the government to spell out its spectrum allocation strategy.

 The company is bullish on 3G-based mobile devices in the country and feels that the demand will now be for 4G.

 Ryu said: Samsung will hold an international conference on 4G at Jeju Island in South Korea in August. We are in touch with a senior professor of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) who is working on the 4G technology. Major operators like Vodafone, SKT, and Orange will participate in the conference.

 We would like to be the pioneers of 4G products in India. Our aim is to offer the latest in technology, he added.

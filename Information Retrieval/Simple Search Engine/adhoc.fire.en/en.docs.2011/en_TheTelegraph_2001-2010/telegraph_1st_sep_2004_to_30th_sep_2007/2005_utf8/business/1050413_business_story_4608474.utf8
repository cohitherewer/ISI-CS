 Road test for Wagoner?s driving skill 

 Wagoner: Bumpy ride

 Detroit, April 12 (Reuters): General Motors Corp CEO Rick Wagoner, facing the automaker?s biggest challenge since it nearly went bankrupt in 1992, has often spoken about the ends that await failed GM executives. 

 The head of the world?s largest automaker frequently refers to GM founder Billy Durant, who lost his fortune speculating on the stock market in the 1920s and ended up running a bowling alley in Flint, Michigan ? a fate that he says ?has haunted GM chairmen ever since?.

 Failure has been rare for Wagoner, who quickly rose through the ranks and joined the executive suite as chief financial officer following a 1992 boardroom coup. 

 But Wagoner put his job on the line last week, analysts said, when he took day-to-day control of GM?s North American car operations from two deputies, aiming to turn around the money-losing business. 

 The challenges facing GM ? which analysts say could lose its ranking as the world?s top-selling automaker to Toyota Motor Corp within a few years ? have spurred credit rating agencies to cut the company?s debt to one step from ?junk? status. 

 Wagoner will need all his reserves of humour and quick thinking as GM struggles with wall-to-wall challenges: falling US market share, mounting health-care costs, and even tougher competition from its foreign competitors. 

 ?I don?t think there?s a question that it?s a tough job,? a former GM corporate officer who asked not to be identified said. ?Is he up to the challenge? Yes. He doesn?t sit back and ponder.?

 The 52-year-old Wagoner, who in 2000 became the youngest head of GM since Alfred Sloan took over in 1923, will depend on his hand-picked management team, including two vice-chairmen with experience at other automakers. But he must also secure co-operation from the powerful, entrenched United Auto Workers union, suppliers, dealers and perhaps even from the US government to attack the mountain of fixed costs that has put GM at a competitive disadvantage, analysts said. 

 ?I think he needs to get the suppliers and dealers behind him,? Thomas Stallkamp, the former president of Chrysler, said. 

 Stallkamp, author of ?Score!: A Better Way to do Busine$$: Moving from Conflict to Collaboration?, said, ?The (GM) organisation has been brought up in this command and control philosophy and they need to modify that approach.? 

 The largest single private US provider of healthcare, GM estimates that its US healthcare costs for more than 1 million current and retired workers and their families will grow to $5.6 billion this year from $5.2 billion in 2004. 

 Those costs, and other contractual obligations to the UAW, cost GM about $2,500 per car sold in the United States, a burden not shared by foreign competitors, said David Cole, director of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. 

 Japan?s Toyota and Nissan Motor Co Ltd and other foreign automakers have a mostly non-union North American workforce and also relatively few retirees to support. 

 For now, Wagoner?s taking control of North America sends a signal to Wall Street and to GM?s partners that he will take serious steps to make GM competitive, said Efraim Levy, an automotive equity analyst with Standard amp; Poor?s. 

 ?They?re trying to show its importance; it?s something they want to deal with,? he said. 

 GM has not revealed any detailed plan for a turnaround strategy. It has high hopes for the new full-size SUVs, which are key to profitability, but they won?t arrive until next year. Last month, GM said it no longer expects a first-quarter profit but looks for its steepest quarterly loss since 1992 due to slowing US sales and rising costs.

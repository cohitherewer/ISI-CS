 Singh negotiates HR minefield with ease

 Singh: Reassuring

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: India?s best-known reforms manager is cutting his teeth on challenges in the tricky HR terrain.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has had to quell rows between steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan and his officers. He also cajoled coal secretary P.C. Parakh to resume his job on Monday after he went on leave due to problems at work.

 Steel ministry officials have been upset with Paswan for the way he has been appointing committees to probe contracts entered into by the state-run iron and steel companies. Most of these decisions were taken jointly by the PSUs concerned and bureaucrats. Investigations are seen by the top brass of the ministry as an attack on them. 

 Coal deals and other decisions taken by the SAIL board, to which bureaucrats from the steel ministry were privy, have been put under the scanner by the minister.

 Paswan was also unhappy with decisions on top-level changes within SAIL which the bureaucracy agreed to. 

 Steel secretary Manoranjan, an ex-plan panel principal adviser who is believed to be a stickler for rules, is among those who does not get along with the minister. The Prime Minister is believed to have intervened in the quarrel which was building up for some time between the two. The upshot: both the secretary and the minister have agreed to work together. 

 The PM had intervened last year too, when Paswan ordered a steel regulator to be set up to fix prices of the metal sold by companies like SAIL and Tisco. The ministry officials had not been supportive of this move either, and the PMO too had given a verdict in their favour. 

 Similarly, in the case of Parakh, an upright IAS officer hounded by unsubstantiated corruption charges from MPs at a consultative committee meeting chaired by minister of state for coal Dasari Narayana Rao, the Prime Minister had to intervene to get the secretary back to his desk. 

 In the earlier Congress regimes, tiffs between the bureaucracy and politicians rarely come out in the open. Disagreements had resulted in transfers of either the senior bureaucrat, or both the officer and the minister.

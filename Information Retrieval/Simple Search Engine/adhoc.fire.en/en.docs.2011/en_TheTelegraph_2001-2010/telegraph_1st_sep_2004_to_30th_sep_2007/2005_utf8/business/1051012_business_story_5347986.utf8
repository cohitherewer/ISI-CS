 Gold scales 17-year peak on oil fears

 Chain reaction

 London, Oct. 11 (Bloomberg): Gold traded at nearly a 17-year high as gains in energy prices prompted investors to buy bullion as a hedge against inflation. Some investors buy gold in times of inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income assets such as stocks and bonds.

 Gold for immediate delivery, which lost support in the New York markets, regained in Asia as much as $2.30, or 0.5 per cent, to $477.55 an ounce. It reached $478.92 an ounce yesterday, the highest since January 15, 1988.

 The US consumer prices rose the most in 14 years last month as fuel costs soared after hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

 The yellow metal surged to $873 an ounce in 1980, as consumer prices rose more than 12 per cent from the previous year. Gold may reach $500 by the third quarter of next year, traders said. We are still quite bullish on gold, they added.

 The dollar will remain weak, physical demand will remain robust and there is an increasing demand for gold from the investor community, said a leading merchant in London.

 A weaker dollar makes gold more attractive as an alternative investment to stocks and bonds. The correlation coefficient for gold and the euro mainly controlled the prices since last few months.

 The precious mental has gained 12 per cent in three months on concerns that a surge in crude oil prices will stoke inflation. Oil prices rose to a record on August 30, a day after hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast.

 Local surge

 The record-breaking stride in gold was checked on the bullion market in Mumbai today, adds PTI. Standard gold opened at a new high of Rs 6,970, but later softened and ended at Rs 6,965, a gain of Rs 10 over the previous close of Rs 6,955. Similarly, pure gold, after a firm start at Rs 7,005, softened to end at Rs 7,000, a gain of Rs 10 over yesterdays close of Rs 6,990.

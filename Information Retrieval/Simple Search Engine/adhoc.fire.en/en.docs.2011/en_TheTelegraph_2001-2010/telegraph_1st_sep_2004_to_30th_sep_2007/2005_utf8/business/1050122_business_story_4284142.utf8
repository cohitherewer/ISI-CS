 TVs catch higher-sale signal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 21: The television and audio system manufacturers are happy with the luxury tax breather announced by the Supreme Court on January 20.

 According to the judgment passed by the apex court yesterday, states cannot impose luxury tax on goods but can continue to do so on services.

 The Bengal government has slapped this levy on 19 items, of which five attract a 10 per cent tax and the remaining 14 draw 5 per cent.

 The levy on televisions over 25 inches is 5 per cent while that on smaller sizes is 2 per cent.

 Bengal has only one colour television (CTV) manufacturing facility owned by the Videocon group at Salt Lake. The unit manufactures CTVs under the brand names of Videocon, Akai, Sansui and Toshiba. It has also started manufacturing TVs for Hyundai.

 Gautam Sengupta, head of the plant, said, ?The move will have a direct impact on our sales. The prices will go down at least by Rs 300-700, depending on the size of the television.?

 The company manufactures 50,000 CTVs per month at the facility. Of this, 25 per cent is sold in Bengal.

 ?The state is witnessing a growth in TV consumption. We will pass on the benefits of this ruling to our customers,? Sengupta said.

 Senior Sony officials said the move will boost TV sales in the state. 

 The Supreme Court?s judgment has also delighted the audio manufacturers.

 Philips India, with the largest marketshare in the audio segment, sells heavily in the eastern region, including Bengal.

 Bata India is also happy with the development as shoes, which are priced over Rs 700, attract a luxury tax of 5 per cent. 

 Analysts say the Supreme Court has passed the judgment at the right time. ?The value-added tax (VAT) will be introduced from April 1, 2005. The impact of VAT is not yet clear. Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta, who is the chairman of the empowered committee on VAT, has assured that the state tax incidence will come down once VAT is introduced. But unless it becomes effective, we cannot get a clear picture. The removal of luxury tax has brought some relief before VAT is implemented.?

 Senior officials of the state finance department today said the government will take some legal opinion once they get the copy of the Supreme Court order. 

 The state has collected nearly Rs 80 crore luxury tax till January 19.

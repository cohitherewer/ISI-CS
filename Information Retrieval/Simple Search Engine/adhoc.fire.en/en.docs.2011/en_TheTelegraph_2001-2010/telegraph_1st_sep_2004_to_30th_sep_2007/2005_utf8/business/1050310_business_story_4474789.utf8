 Aviva buys motor services firm

 London, March 9 (Reuters): British insurer Aviva Plc said it had agreed to buy UK motor services company RAC Plc for about ?1.1 billion ($2.1 billion) to boost its booming British general insurance business.

 Britain?s biggest insurer will pay 462-1/2 pence cash and 0.7154 new Aviva shares for each RAC share to combine RAC with its Norwich Union UK business, Aviva said.

 RAC shareholders will also retain the right to the proposed final dividend of 15.6p in respect of 2004. ?The acquisition of RAC ... builds on our success in the UK general insurance market and creates a powerful new combination in insurance and motoring services,? Aviva chief executive Richard Harvey said in a statement.

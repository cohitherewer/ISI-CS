 RBI caps AllBanks insurance stake

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Sept. 28: The Reserve Bank of India has asked Allahabad Bank to keep its stake in the proposed insurance venture below 50 per cent. The regulator has said private partners should have a 51 per cent stake in the company.

 Allahabad Bank, which has decided to enter the non-life insurance business, has initiated talks with United Bank of India and Union Bank to become joint-venture partners.

 The bank will enter the insurance sector through its wholly-owned subsidiary, AllBank Finance, which also has the licence for merchant banking. The bank has to seek the RBIs permission for entering the insurance sector.

 Sources said the RBIs decision to keep the public sector banks holding in the insurance venture below 50 per cent is aimed at making the bank devote more time to its core area of business ? banking.

 The bank is also talking to insurance and finance companies in Singapore and Hong Kong for joining the insurance foray. 

 According to the existing norms in the country, a foreign partner cannot hold more than a 26 per cent stake in an insurance company. The rest 74 per cent will have to be with the Indian partner/partners. 

 The bank is also talking to several Indian companies for the proposed insurance foray. Some of them have shown interest and negotiations are currently on. Things will take a final shape in another two months, sources added. 

 Ernst amp; Young, the consultant appointed by Allahabad Bank to work out a roadmap for its insurance foray, has recommended the non-life insurance business. 

 AllBank Finance has a capital base of Rs 60 crore, which is not enough to sustain the insurance business. The capital base of an insurance business should be Rs 100 crore. Therefore, the bank is looking for joint venture partners. 

 Explaining the rationale behind entering the non-life insurance business, senior officials of the bank said, The non-life sector in India has not witnessed the growth that it should have. But the mindset is changing and there is an immense opportunity in this sector. We have to translate these opportunities into business.

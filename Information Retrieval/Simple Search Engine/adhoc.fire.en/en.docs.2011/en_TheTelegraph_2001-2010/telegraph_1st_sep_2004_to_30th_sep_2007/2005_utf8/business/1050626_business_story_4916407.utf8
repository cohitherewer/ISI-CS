 Calcutta, June 25: Sidbi Capital Venture plans to launch some niche funds next year.

 The venture capital funds can be set up with respect to size, sector or even geographical location, said chief executive officer Ajay Kumar Kapur. He was speaking on the sidelines of a seminar on knowledge process outsourcing organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce.

 Although we took five years to launch our second venture fund, we plan to introduce our next funds faster and hopefully within the next year, he added.

 The company will also consider proposals from global entities for setting up such funds, said Kapur.

 We have received proposals from certain overseas funds, but are yet to take any decision. At present, we are focussed on deploying the sum accumulated in our two funds, he added.

 In October last year, the company had launched a Rs 500-crore SME growth fund. The fund is a diversified one and will invest across all sectors.

 However, the focus areas are lifesciences, including pharmaceuticals and biotech, light engineering and auto components, services and infrastructure, Kapur added.

 The company has partnered with major banks for the fund. State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank have each contributed Rs 100 crore, while Bank of Baroda and Oriental Bank of Commerce have chipped in with Rs 50 crore each.

 So far, we have invested Rs 26 crore and expect to end the year with a disbursement of Rs 150 crore, he said. The company has set a target to invest the amount over a period of four years. However, it now expects to complete the disbursement in the next 2-3 years due to the buoyant economy, Kapur added.

 Sidbi Venture Capital also has a Rs-100-crore national fund for software and IT, which invests across all sectors, including ITeS, BPO, software products and services.

 The first fund was launched just before the meltdown in the IT sector. Despite that the projects we invested in have emerged as winners. Thus, we have been able to provide good returns to the investors despite the bubble burst, added Kapur.

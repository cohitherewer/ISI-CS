 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 25: Maruti Udyog today launched the Euro III version of its entry-level runabout ? the Maruti 800 ? with a price tag of Rs 2.14 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). The AC version will be sold at Rs 2.37 lakh.

 Starting April 1, carmakers will have to sell Euro III versions of their models in 11 cities, including Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, Ahmedabad, Surat, Kanpur and Agra. Euro II versions will be available in other cities.

 The country?s largest carmaker also raised the prices of the Euro-II standard and air-conditioned versions of the model by Rs 3000 each at Rs 2.08 lakh and Rs 2.31 lakh respectively. 

 The upgraded version will now come with headlight levelling mechanism, clear lens rear combination lamps and a new grille.

 Maruti had earlier announced price increases for the Euro II and Euro III versions of other models.

 The company says the Euro III 800 has a new look from the outside, a spruced-up interior and upgrades under the bonnet that enable it to meet superior emission norms. The Euro-III compliant version of the new Maruti 800 also has a superior, 32-bit electronic control unit.

 Managing director Jagdish Khattar said: ?Just when there was talk about the Maruti 800 being phased out, this iconic brand has donned a fresh new look. It is a gift to the millions of two-wheeler owners who are looking to upgrade to a car.? 

 The new Maruti 800 comes in colours of crystal gold, icy blue and carribean blue.

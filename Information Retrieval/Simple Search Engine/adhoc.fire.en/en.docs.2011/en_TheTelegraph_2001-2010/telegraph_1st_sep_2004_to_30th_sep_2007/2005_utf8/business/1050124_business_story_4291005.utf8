 IT firms emerge leading job providers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 23: The information technology (IT) and IT-enabled industry has emerged as the leading employment provider, accounting for 44 per cent of the 7,558 jobs advertised in the last two months.

 Mumbai created the maximum job opportunities in this sector, accounting for 28 per cent followed by Delhi at 25 per cent and Bangalore at 24 per cent. About 40 per cent of these insertions (advertisements) came from Bangalore.

 The Assocham Eco Pulse (AEP) has tracked the job advertisements in newspapers across the country and Internet sites. 

 The Assocham Eco Pulse?s interaction with industry leaders indicated that the IT-enabled sector is set for a huge growth and a commensurate impact on creation of jobs will be visible in the next few years.

 Releasing the AEP report, Assocham president Mahendra K. Sanghi said, ?The domestic business process outsourcing (BPO) sector is set to grow at a phenomenal pace from $4 billion to $15.5 billion by 2008. Inherent cost advantage, a large pool of skilled manpower and availability of domain expertise will remain the key drivers for growth.?

 The finance sector accounted for 24 per cent of the job placements, while marketing for 10 per cent of the positions advertised. Like in finance, Mumbai created the maximum jobs for marketing personnel. 

 More than 33 per cent of the insertions for marketing came from Mumbai, according to the survey.

 Sensex returns to form with a ton

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov. 23: Stock markets staged a sharp turnaround today, boosted by the conviction that developments in Bihar will not cause political instability at the Centre. A rally in key heavyweights contributed largely to the 103-point surge in the BSE benchmark index.

 Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), which received a rating boost from Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P), led the rally. S amp;P upgraded its long-term foreign and local currency ratings to BBB from BB+ with a stable outlook.

 Brokers said the equities opened on a good note because of good cues from the US and Asian markets. The Hang Seng today closed 176.70 points higher, the Taiwan index 64 points, the Kospi 37.52 points and the Singapore STindex 18.48 points. 

 Even as a buying spree from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) on Tuesday encouraged market participants, the rally gathered steam on account of short-covering.

 The 30-share BSE sensex opened at 8542.61 and rallied sharply to an intra-day high of 8649.68 before ending the day at 8638.34 against yesterdays close of 8534.97, a net recovery of 103.37 points or 1.21 per cent.

 The sensex had come down by more than 150 points in the last two sessions after a slowdown in FII inflows last week. However, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) figures for Tuesday showed that they made a net investment of $37.4 million.

 Most indices registered a good growth on the Bombay Stock Exchange except for the healthcare and metal segments.

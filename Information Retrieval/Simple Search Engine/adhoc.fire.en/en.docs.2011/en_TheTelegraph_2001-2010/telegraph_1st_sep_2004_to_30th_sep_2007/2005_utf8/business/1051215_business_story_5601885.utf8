 Calcutta, Dec. 14: Mahindra amp; Mahindras Bolero has taken over the number one slot in utility vehicles (UV) category.

 The company has managed to grow this brand by 30 per cent during the first 11 months of this year, eclipsing Sumo of Tata Motors.

 Last year, Toyotas Qualis was the market leader in this segment. However, the Japanese auto-maker decided to withdraw this model and introduced Innova, a premium segment product.

 Following this, the existing players jumped in to fill the void. We have managed to carve out the biggest chunk of the market and emerge as number one in the UV segment, said Ravindra S. Shahane, deputy general manager (marketing) of M amp;M. 

 The UV market grew by 10 per cent this year, but Bolero managed to beat the market by a long haul. Together with Scorpio, M amp;Ms premium UV, the company is the largest player in the segment.

 We have about 50 per cent market share in the UV segment, he added. Shahane expressed hope that the company would be able to carry forward its performance in 2006.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 An old set of wheels

 The used-car business is booming. Sutanuka Ghosal tells you how to get a loan for a second-hand vehicle

 Neeraj and Varsha are yet to turn 30. Neeraj is a project manager with a software company and Varsha is a school teacher. They live in the southernmost fringe of the city. They plan to buy a car that will run about 50 km a day.

 They initially looked at the familiar runabout ? the Maruti 800. But they later plumped for a slightly used Ford Ikon, which cost twice their initial budget. 

 The reason: Neeraj?s classmate at college had just purchased one after his promotion last month. Peer pressure is fast becoming one of the dominant factors that influences purchase decisions today.

 ?Peer pressure as well as social pressure are forcing decent earning couples to buy pre-owned expensive car models rather than a vanilla product,? said Sachin Khandelwal, head of auto loans of ICICI Bank.

 Banks in the pre-owned car financing segment say well-to-do families are also going in for second-hand cars when they scout for choices as second or third vehicles in their house.

 The used car market is gradually opening up. G. P. Pattanaik, senior vice-president of Magma Leasing, says, ?Earlier the banks and the institutions were sceptical about financing pre-owned cars. Now, the market has become very structured. There are auto dealers who only deal with pre-owned cars. So there is a known channel for pre-owned cars.?

 Khandelwal says every 18 months, a large number of car owners sell their existing vehicles and buy new ones. This has given a spurt in the second-hand car market.

 ?Customers are preferring Maruti Zen, Alto and Santro in the B segment and Accent and Ford Ikon in the C segment, quot; said Pattanaik. 

 However, there?s a caveat for buyers: financiers say they must ensure that several documents are in order before they plan to look for loans for those dream wheels.

 First and foremost, the regional tax office (RTO) receipt should be there. The RTO tax is once in a lifetime tax and should have been paid by the original owner of the car. 

 Then check the registration of the car. The state of registration mentioned in the books should be the state in which you plan to use the car. Under the rules, a driver is not allowed to drive a car that does not belong to that state. If the state of registration is different from that in which the buyer plans to use the car, one must ensure that the seller changes the registration to the required state.

 Insurance is the most important document for any car. The buyer should insist on insurance papers as these are mandatory for any transfer by the RTO. Premium for insurance is paid on a regular basis and it is advisable to check the due date. The buyer also has to ensure transfer of the insurance papers into his name. 

 If someone does not go through a dealer for buying the pre-owned car, then one should get the original invoice of the car from the original owner. One can know details like engine number, chassis number, date of delivery, delivery dealer and whether the car was financed or not. 

 The buyer of the pre-owned car should also get a no-objection certificate from the finance company that had financed the new car. This document ensures that the finance company has no claim on the car anymore. 

 The second-hand car financiers usually provide loans for cars that are less than five years old. They have authorised third-party valuers who carry out the valuation of the pre-owned car.

 In most cases the buyer has to obtain a fitness certificate either from a standard garage or from the Automobile Association of India.

 The interest and upfront payment that a customer has to bear varies among banks.

 Piramyd debuts at 22% premium

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 6: Piramyd Retail Ltd today made an euphoric debut at the stock exchanges with its share price opening at Rs 146, which is at a 22 premium to the issue price of Rs 120, on the Bombay Stock Exchange. 

 On a day when the benchmark BSE sensex ended flat on choppy trades, Piramyd was the top traded share in the B1 category. 

 During the day, the Piramyd share price shot to an intra-day high of Rs 149. However, profit booking by investors saw the scrip losing the gain and the price ended lower at Rs 131.65. The finish marked a premium of 10 per cent to the issue price. The Piramyd counter saw 46.67 lakh shares changing hands, reflecting a turnover of Rs 63.80 crore.

 Piramyd had entered the capital market with an IPO of 90 lakh shares with a price band of Rs 120-140 per share. The company had subsequently fixed the issue price at Rs 120. The issue was over-subscribed 11.62 times. 

 The equity offer included a promoters contribution of 40 lakh equity shares and the remaining 50 lakh equity shares comprised the net offer to the public. The post-issue paid-up capital of the company stands at Rs 20 crore.

 Piramyd is planning to deploy the IPO proceeds for funding its capital expenditure requirements, upgradation of information technology infrastructure and repayment of bridge loans. 

 According to its expansion plan, the company will now focus on the western and the northern regions in the country. At present it is present in two retail businesses ? lifestyle retail through Piramyd megastore and home, food and personal care through TruMart. The company plans to add at least 17 more Piramyd megastores and 69 TruMart stores by 2008.

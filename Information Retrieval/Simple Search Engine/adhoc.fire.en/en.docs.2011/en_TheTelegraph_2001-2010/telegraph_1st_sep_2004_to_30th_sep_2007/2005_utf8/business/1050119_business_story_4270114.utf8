 Calcutta, Jan. 18: Eveready Industries will invest Rs 40 crore to increase its battery and flashlight output. 

 The company will spend Rs 30 crore on a new battery line at its Calcutta factory, which will raise battery capacity to 1.4 billion from 1.2 billion per annum.

 The expansion at the Calcutta factory will be over by October. ?This will be a new imported line from Japan,? said Deepak Khaitan, executive vice-chairman and managing director of Eveready.

 The company will invest Rs 10 crore in a greenfield project in Uttaranchal for manufacturing brass flashlights.

 Eveready will mark its centenary this year with mega brand building, capacity expansion and growth, Khaitan said. ?My vision is to achieve a 2-billion battery production,? he said.

 Eveready has a 46 per cent market share in batteries.

 The company also plans to acquire a battery business in China. ?We are talking to two to three companies in China in the Shanghai province. We will acquire a 25-45 per cent stake in the company and remain a minority shareholder. We expect to take a final call on our Chinese venture by the end of March this year,? he added.

 Eveready has posted a third-quarter net profit of Rs 15.95 crore against a net loss of Rs 10.25 crore in the corresponding previous period.

 For the nine months ended December, the net profit rose to Rs 40.59 crore from Rs 38.78 crore in the year-ago period.

 Khaitan said both the battery and the flashlight businesses are doing well. ?The promotional campaign launched by Amitabh Bachhan has generated a growth of 20-25 per cent in both businesses,? he said.

 Calcutta High Court has approved Eveready?s plan to demerge the tea and battery business.

 The tea business, which will be known as McLeod Russell India post-demerger, has witnessed improved price realisation. The company?s tea has fetched Rs 10-12 more per kg compared with the previous year.

 Eveready?s packet tea business is also growing. ?We have witnessed a growth of 40 per cent in our packet tea business. We are now selling 6,000 tonnes of packet tea under the brand name Tez, Jago and Premium Gold. We expect to grow substantially in the next three years,? he added.

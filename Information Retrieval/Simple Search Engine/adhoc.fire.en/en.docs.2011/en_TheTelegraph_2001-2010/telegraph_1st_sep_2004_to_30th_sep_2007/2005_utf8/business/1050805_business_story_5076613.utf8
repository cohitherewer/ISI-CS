 Panel seeks lower duty on petrol, diesel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 4: The parliamentary standing committee of the petroleum ministry has urged the government to reduce customs and excise levies on petrol and diesel and persuade states to scale down sales tax rates to shield consumers from rising global crude prices.

 The committee report tabled in Parliament today points out that 57 per cent of the petrol price in Delhi comprises central and state taxes. For diesel, this component is 35 per cent. 

 The tax component results in exorbitant prices of these products, it added.

 It has recommended a cut in the customs duty on petrol and diesel from 10 per cent to 5 per cent to bring it on a par with the levy on crude, leaving no room for any differential at this level.

 It has asked the government to replace the ad-valorem element in the excise duty on products by a single specific component.

 The report said, At present, the excise duty on petrol has a specific ad valorem mix of 8 per cent plus Rs 13 a litre. 

 Consequently, 36 per cent of the retail selling price of petrol and 17 per cent of diesel comprises the excise duty component. 

 This means, Rs 14.74 out of Rs 40.49 in retail price of petrol and Rs 4.93 out of Rs 28.45 of diesel in Delhi owe to the excise component alone. 

 As high levies were mostly responsible for the exorbitant and varied retail selling prices, it recommends the Centre to persuade states to bring down sales tax to a uniform floor rate.

 The committee wants the duty drawback incentive for export of petroleum goods to be withdrawn. 

 The government can then make use of the revenue gains to bring down the excise duties on fuel. It can then pass on the benefit enjoyed by exporters to the consumers in line with the stated policy of equitable distribution of burden, the report said.

 It also recommended the scrapping of import parity pricing of petroleum products. Under this mechanism, the refinery gate prices of products are calculated by adding ocean freight, insurance, customs duty, ocean loss and port charges to the fee-on-board (fob) price of the product in the international market.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Ruia upbeat about deal

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Nov 24: Jessop owner Pawan Ruia is gung-ho about his chances of snapping up ailing tyremaker Dunlop because he claims to be the only bidder who is making a play for the entire tyre business operations of the Chhabria-owned Jumbo group. 

 Speaking to The Telegraph, Ruia claimed that other bidders had not evinced interest in all the three tyre companies that the Chhabrias are putting on the block: Dunlop, Falcon Tyres and India Tyre Co, a trading company.

 To acquire all the three companies, Ruia may have to fork out Rs 700 crore, which include liabilities on the books of Dunlop.

 Dunlop might have huge liabilities on its books, which will come to us, if we win the bid, Ruia said.

 Industry sources said others have only bid for Falcon Tyres and not Dunlop. We have only bid for Falcon, a JK Tyre spokesperson said.

 Ruia is in talks with banks and financial institutions to arrange the funds for his bid. We need Rs 50 crore to start operations, he added.

 However, the biggest challenge might come from the labour unions at Sahagunj. Ruia claimed that the factory in Hooghly district would not require more than 1,000 workers. It has about 2,800 people on the rolls at present.

 He is confident he will persuade the state and the trade unions to agree to his plan to right size the work force. Everyone has to make sacrifices to start the factory, he said.

 He hopes to start operations at Sahagunj factory within three to four months after the completion of all the formalities. However, this would depend on approvals from all quarters: the unions, the government, banks and financial institutions, and the BIFR and AAIFR.

 The bids are now with Ambit Finance, which will process them. The winner will be announced in a months time.

 Many believe that Ruia had set his sights on a company like Dunlop because of its huge idle properties. Ruia riposted that Dunlop had very few assets left that could be monetised except for the property at Worli in Mumbai.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Race for Telecom Italia pie in Greek 

 firm

 HEATHER TIMMONS 

 London, April 4: Two private 

 equity firms, the Texas Pacific Group and Apax Partners, 

 are expected to announce soon that they will acquire Telecom 

 Italia?s controlling stake in a Greek phone company for 

 $1.4 billion, according to two executives involved in the 

 negotiations. 

 The firms have been trying to 

 acquire Telecom Italia?s 80 per cent stake in the company, 

 TIM Hellas Telecommunications, since February. Just a few 

 weeks ago, a deal looked uncertain after exclusive talks 

 between Telecom Italia and the two buyers ended without 

 an agreement. Apax and Texas Pacific are expected to split 

 ownership of the TIM Hellas stake evenly, and increase the 

 company?s presence in Greece by investing in new products 

 and marketing. 

 Private equity companies have 

 been increasing their presence in the European telecommunications 

 industry in recent months, buying up assets as conglomerates 

 shed non-core businesses and governments privatise the industry. 

 In a $15-billion deal expected 

 to be signed this month, industry executives and buyout 

 specialists are vying for control of Wind, an Italian telecom 

 company that is a unit of the power company Enel. TIM Hellas 

 did not return calls for comment on Sunday evening. 

 TIM Hellas, which has 2.3 million 

 customers, is Greeces third-largest mobile phone company, 

 behind the Vodafone subsidiary Panafon and Cosmote Mobile 

 Telecommunications. 

 TIM Hellas is based in Athens 

 and has grown rapidly since it was formed in 1992, but encountered 

 problems last year, forcing the resignation of its chief 

 executive, Nikolaos Varsakis. The company?s net income dropped 

 14 per cent in 2004, to 78.8 million euros ($101.6 million), 

 as competition increased in Greece. 

 The deal price is lower than some 

 analysts estimated earlier this month, but still represents 

 a slight premium to TIM Hellas? market value.

 Based on the companys closing 

 price on Nasdaq on Friday, an 80 percent stake would be 

 valued at about $1.36 billion. Telecom Italia is expected 

 to record a 400 million euro capital gain because of the 

 sale. 

 On March 24, TIM Hellas approved 

 a dividend of 0.10 euro for shareholders, on par with 2003, 

 despite the companys performance last year. The move 

 affirmed the companys quot;commitment to providing 

 a tangible return quot; to shareholders, the current chief 

 executive, Socrates Kominakis, said in a statement at the 

 time.

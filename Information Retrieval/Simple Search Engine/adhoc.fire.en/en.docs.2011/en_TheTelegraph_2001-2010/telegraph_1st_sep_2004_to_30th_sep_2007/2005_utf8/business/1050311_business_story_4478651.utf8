 Twin SAIL projects to cost Rs 180 crore

 Charged up

 Calcutta, March 10: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) will take up two projects at Bhilai and Bokaro at an estimated investment of Rs 180 crore.

 The board today gave its in-principle approval to revamp the sinter plant-II at Bhilai Steel Plant and install an air turbo compressor and oxygen turbo compressor at the oxygen plant in Bokaro Steel.

 Revamping the sinter plant will enable Bhilai Steel Plant to increase the annual production from 2.5 MT to 3.1 MT, while improving the quality of sinter as well. This will also contribute to an additional production of around 77,000 tonnes of pig iron from the three sinter-making units of Bhilai Steel Plant.

 The increased sinter burden is also expected to enhance the productivity of blast furnaces, effecting a substantial reduction in the cost of production and coke rate.

 The significant benefit will, however, accrue from the installation of electrostatic precipitators in all the four sinter machines of plant-II, which will further reduce the stack emission to below the permissible level.

 The installation of one air turbo compressor and one oxygen turbo compressor at Bokaro?s oxygen plant will help meet the enhanced requirement of compressed air to augment oxygen production. 

 This is necessary because of the ongoing thrust on implementing auxiliary fuel injection methods such as coal dust or tar injection facilities in all the blast furnaces. The requirement of oxygen will further increase with the enhancement of oxygen enrichment in all the blast furnaces. 

 With this, the total planned investment in different projects approved, both in-principle and final, during the current financial year stands at over Rs 2,500 crore. These projects form a part of SAIL?s plan to increase the hot metal production from 13 million tonnes (MT) per annum to 20 MT by 2011-12 at a total estimated investment of Rs 25,000 crore.

 The major projects under implementation in different units of SAIL include installation of bloom caster at Durgapur Steel Plant (Rs 271 crore) and upgradation of ERW Pipe Plant (Rs 89 crore), rebuilding of coke oven battery (Rs 112 crore) and capital repair of Blast Furnace (4) (Rs 118 crore) at Rourkela Steel Plant. 

 The projects in Bhilai include rebuilding of coke oven battery (Rs 219 crore), upgradation of blast furnace, including a gas cleaning plant (Rs 170 crore), a wire rod mill (Rs 75 crore) and plate mill (Rs 64 crore). Rebuilding of coke oven battery (Rs 199 crore) is on at Bokaro.

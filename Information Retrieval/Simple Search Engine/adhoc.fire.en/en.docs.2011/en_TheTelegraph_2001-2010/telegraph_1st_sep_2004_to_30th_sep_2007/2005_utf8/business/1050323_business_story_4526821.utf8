 Singapore Air in $2.6-bn plane deal

 Ready to take off 

 Singapore, March 22 (Reuters): The leasing arm of Singapore Airlines Ltd, the world?s second-most valuable airline, said on Tuesday it would buy up to 40 Boeing Co 737-800 planes ? a deal worth about $2.6 billion at current list prices. 

 Singapore Aircraft Leasing Enterprise (SALE) said the deal comprises 20 firm orders and 20 purchase rights, with deliveries scheduled between the fourth quarter of 2006 and the end of 2009. 

 It did not give the value of the order. Forty new 737-800 planes would be worth $2.6 billion at current list prices. 

 ?SALE has specified the 737-800 as the baseline aircraft for its order. Under the terms of its agreement with Boeing, SALE has the flexibility to convert orders and purchase rights to the smaller 737-700 or proposed higher capacity 737-900X,? it said. 

 The unit of Singapore?s state-controlled flag carrier said the fleet will be powered by engines from CFM International ? a joint venture between General Electric Co and France?s Snecma 

 The purchase represents SALE?s first direct order with Boeing for the Next-Generation 737 product line, although the company has previously acquired eight aircraft from airlines on a purchase and leaseback basis, it said. 

 SALE already has outstanding firm orders with Airbus for 11 A320s, due for delivery between now and the end of the second quarter of 2006. 

 Robert Martin, SALE managing director and chief executive officer, said the order reflected the strong recovery in demand for leased aircraft and would further diversify the firms portfolio. 

 ?The addition of the aircraft to our portfolio will enable SALE to reach a wider range of airline customers and significantly develop our global business,? he said.

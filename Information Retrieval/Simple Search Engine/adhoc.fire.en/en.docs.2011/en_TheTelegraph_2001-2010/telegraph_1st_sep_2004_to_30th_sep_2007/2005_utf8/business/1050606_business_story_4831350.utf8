 Chandralekha Tulal shows how to cash in on credit card purchases

 Imagine this. You walk into a shop, buy stuff worth Rs 5,000 and pay. While you are about to leave, someone comes running after you and gives you back Rs 250. That surely will make you happy ? getting back 5 per cent of the amount spent.

 This might remind you of a television advertisement, in which a family on reaching home after shopping, finds a walking wad of notes knocking on their door. They welcome it with open arms.

 That?s Citibank offering a cash-back card. Under this scheme, you are eligible to get up to 5 per cent of cash-back on every purchase.

 Citibank is not alone. ICICI Bank is also offering such a facility. However, while Citibank is issuing these as separate type of cards, ICICI Bank has offered these features to all its 3.3 million credit cardholders for specified promotional periods. The latest offer is open from June 1 to August 31. 

 However, there are certain conditions attached to the offer. You have to shop with your ICICI Bank credit card at merchant outlets where the bank has installed card-swiping machines. Thus, the offer is restricted to 30,000 establishments across the country.

 Also, each purchase has to be above Rs 2,000, with total cumulative spends during the promotional period at Rs 10,000 or above at any outlet across the world.

 Again, the offer is subject to a maximum cash-back of Rs 2,500 per card within the promotional period. This means purchases must be worth at least Rs 50,000.

 However, since Citibank issues a completely different card ? and only to those who apply for it ? the bank has an edge over others as there is no time limit.

 Nevertheless, there is a minimum cash-back accrual required to be redeemed. This is usually Rs 250. The maximum cash-back accrual possible in a year is Rs 20,000.

 The card member gets 1-1.25 per cent cash back irrespective of the category of spend. Beyond that, the level of cash-back changes with the expenditure known as 54321 accelerator.

 For instance, if you swipe your Citibank cash-back card to buy medicine, you will get back 5 per cent in your monthly card statement. But, if you pay cellphone and other utility bills, the discount is lesser at 3 per cent.

 The card has overseas incentives too. If someone withdraws cash abroad from an international ATM, he or she gets 4 per cent cash back. Any purchases made abroad or withdrawal from local ATM leads to a 2 per cent cash-back.

 So what is the rationale behind this?

 B. Madhivanan, who heads the cards business division of ICICI Bank, says, ?The cash back concept is popular across the world for driving consumer spend.?

 While banks have been issuing millions of credit and debit cards, not all have been activated, and the cost involved in issuing a single plastic card run into hundreds of rupees.

 ?In India, out of 13 million credit cardholders, there are very few who are frequent users. Most of them use cards during emergencies or during festivals,? Madhivanan said. 

 ?In most other countries, the cards are used for all transactions. So, the idea is once the customer is hooked to the card, he?s bound to continue, with or without the scheme,? he explained.

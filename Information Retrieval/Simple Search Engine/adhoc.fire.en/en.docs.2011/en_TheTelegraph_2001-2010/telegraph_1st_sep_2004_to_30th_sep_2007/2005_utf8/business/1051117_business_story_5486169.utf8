 Titans want PM to answer spectrum call 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Singh: Mediator

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: Tata and Reliance want Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to intervene in a row over spectrum allocation.

 The two companies want Singh to direct the communications ministry to set up a committee consisting of operators and government officials to resolve the issue of spectrum allocation.

 Spectrum are airwaves on which voice and data travel.

 In September, communications minister Dayanidhi Maran had said a committee comprising government officials and private operators would be set up to resolve the spectrum issue. The committee was to be formed by early October and submit its suggestions by November. But the panel has not been constituted yet.

 Tata Teleservices director Mukund Govind Rajan, who is the new president of the Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India (Auspi), said, ?If it is within our means, it would be a travesty for us to settle for anything less than making telecom connectivity available to every adult and every other child in India in the next two years.?

 The association has sought sufficient up-front allocation to allow efficient planning, based on an international average of 15+15 mhz.

 Commenting on the contradiction within the members on the issue of spectrum pricing and how he plans to build a consensus, Govind said there is no problem since the ultimate objective is to allocate spectrum only to serious players. Both Tata and Reliance have the same objective.

 ?I do not think anyone in the telecom industry will have any dispute with my description of the new leadership (Ratan Tata, who took over reigns of TTSL, and Anil Ambani as Reliance Infocomm chief) as formidable. We will be able to bring consensus on the pricing of spectrum among the members,? said Govind.

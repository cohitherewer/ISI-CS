 Aiyar cries foul over PetroKazakh buyout

 Aiyar: Fair play

 New Delhi, Oct. 17: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today accused investment banker Goldman Sachs of indulging in foul play in the auction of PetroKazakhstan by unfairly selling the company to Chinas CNPC even though ONGC-Videsh (OVL) and the Mittal group had jointly put in a higher bid. 

 Aiyar alleged that the Chinese were given an unfair chance to revise their bid after it was found to be lower than the $3.98-billion bid of the OVL-Mittal combine on August 19. 

 Aiyar said although the OVL-Mittal joint venture was told that it, too, could submit a revised bid by August 22, the sale of PetroKazakhstan was announced before office hours on Monday, without allowing the combine a fresh bid to compete against the Chinese.

 Aiyar said he had held talks with his Kazakh counterpart V. Shkolnik on October 4 to see if Indian firms can be involved in PetroKazakhstan after the Kazakh government passes a new law allowing the state to intervene in the sale of oil and gas fields to foreigners.

 When PetroKazakhstan gets restructured and a legal framework is in place, we can, perhaps, start talking about how we can ensure Indian participation in assets run by the company, he said. 

 OVL had formed a pact with the Mittal group because of the influence it wields in these countries due to its steel business, but the Chinese turned out to be a step ahead.

 Interestingly, the Chinese company has also run into problems on the deal because the Kazakh Parliament is framing a new law to prevent the hand-over of oil and gas assets to foreign firms. 

 In this case, the Chinese deal has come under fire as the Kazakh governments permission was not taken before the Canada-based company that owned PetroKazhakstan put it up for sale.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Tech-tonic shift in market cap

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL AND SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, April 20: The four IT heavyweights ? Infosys, TCS, Wipro and Satyam ? together lost Rs 22,288 crore market capitalisation since Infosys stunned the bourses with muted guidance for the first quarter of the current fiscal.

 Today?s trading session saw the combined market capitalisation of these four stocks melt down to Rs 1,60,192 crore against Rs 1,82,480 crore a week back. During the same period, the BSE TECk index has shed 124.17 points.

 The market capitalisation of Infosys slid to Rs 51,700 crore from Rs 56,783 crore on April 13, before marginally recovering today to Rs 52,707 crore.

 Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) continued to pull down the total market capitalisation today as well. The company?s market cap fell to Rs 53590 crore from Rs 67238 crore last Wednesday.

 Wipro and Satyam, whose results are yet to be announced, also got hammered in the process. However, today?s trading saw these stocks bouncing back and recouped some of their losses.

 While TCS and Wipro maintained their positions as the fourth and seventh largest companies based on market capitalisation on the Bombay Stock Exchange, Infosys lost a rank and was placed at the sixth position and Satyam slid to rank 25 from 22.

 Kotak Securities vice- president and head of research Amitabh Chakraborty said on the back of a weakening dollar, the software sector was in focus in a falling market. 

 ?In the pre-result session, a lot of money went into these stocks with high leveraged positions. However, the result shock from these heavyweights shook the market and such positions were sold off, which again dragged down these stocks,? he said.

 ?Nevertheless, we feel that such positions have now been totally covered and the selling in such counters have already been concluded,? added Chakraborty.

 Analysts feel that the technology stocks may also witness a lot of selling pressure from mutual funds. 

 ?Most of the funds have a huge exposure to the technology stocks and when these stocks are beaten on the bourses, the fund?s net asset values are instantly worse hit. This may compel the fund managers to exit from these stocks,? said a sector analyst.

 ?Though the results of Infosys are in alignment with our estimates, it fell below the market expectations. But we have not revisited our stance on the company,? said Chakraborty. 

 The broking house maintains its fiscal 2006 first-quarter EPS forecast of Rs 91 and a target price of Rs 2,400. 

 ?We believe that at the current price, the stock has once again become attractive,? he added.

 ?However, the TCS results were below our expectations and therefore, we have revisited our EPS and target price figures,? said Chakraborty. 

 For TCS, Kotak has lowered the EPS estimate to Rs 51 from Rs 65. The target price has been revised to Rs 1,350 from Rs 1,410.

 The market is now keenly anticipating the results of Wipro and Satyam and watchers feel that the next few trading sessions will be marked with nervousness and volatility.

 Market expects a 11 per cent growth in the topline of Wipro with a 5 per cent growth in net profit. For Satyam, the revenue growth is pegged at 6 per cent and an 8 per cent rise in profit.

 ?Again, if these companies spring a surprise and post figures below the expectations, the sector and the stocks will be in for a turmoil,? said Chakraborty.

 Higher fuel cost pinches Jet Air hard

 OUR BUREAU

 Goyal: Price punch

 Oct. 29: Leading private airline Jet Airways has posted a lower net profit for the second quarter ended September 30. In a period that was marked by high fuel costs due to burgeoning crude oil prices, net profit of the company fell by 11 per cent to Rs 68.59 crore compared with Rs 77.42 crore in the same period last year.

 However, the period saw higher topline growth with the airlines total income rising to Rs 1324.24 crore from Rs 1036.74 crore in the corresponding quarter of 2004-05.

 Chairman Naresh Goyal said, we are pleased to report a positive set of results despite a number of challenges during the quarter. Fuel rates, for instance, were nearly 22 per cent higher versus the same quarter a year ago.

 He added that flood-related disruptions between July 26 and August 3 resulted in direct costs of over Rs 3.5 crore. 

 Our results were simultaneously impacted by under-utilisation of our leased A-340 fleet, which will not be the case in the future since we will be deploying these aircraft on additional international routes such as our Delhi-London Heathrow service, he said.

 Notwithstanding the 10 per cent fare increase that was recently announced, Goyal said fuel prices would remain a key variable. He was, however, optimistic that the second half of the year would be better for the airline.

 Jet Airways executive director Saroj Datta said the airline continued to make progress in its international operations, where it achieved an average seat factor of 68.1 per cent. 

 With the introduction of our Delhi-London-Heathrow service, we are well positioned to capture the growing traffic between India and the UK, particularly in the peak holiday season, which bodes well for the financial performance of our international operations, he said.

 For the half year ended September 30, Jet Airways recorded revenues of Rs 2670 crore, a rise of 36 per cent whereas the profit after tax gained 27 per cent to Rs 160 crore.

 Tata Tea 

 Tata Tea has registered a 17.27 per cent increase in profit after tax at Rs 62.39 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 compared with Rs 53.20 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal.

 Total income went up by 4.65 per cent to Rs 263.51 crore for the reporting quarter from Rs 251.79 crore in the year-ago period.

 The groups consolidated profit rose 32.92 per cent to Rs 101.21 crore for the second quarter this fiscal as against Rs 76.14 crore for the same period last fiscal.

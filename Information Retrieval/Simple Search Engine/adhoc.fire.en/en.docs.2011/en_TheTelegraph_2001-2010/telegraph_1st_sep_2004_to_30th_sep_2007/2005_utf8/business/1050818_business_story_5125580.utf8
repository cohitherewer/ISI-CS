 New JK Paper plant to cost Rs 235 crore

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 17: JK Paper Limited has lined up a slew of expansion plans.

 The company will set up a 60,000-tonne plant for value-added paper products at its Central Pulp Mill (CPM) in Gujarat at a cost of Rs 235 crore. The project will be commissioned in 18 months.

 The Rs 730-crore company has two integrated pulp and paper plants ? JK Paper Mill at Rayagada in Orissa with an annual output of over 1.1 lakh tonnes and Central Pulp Mill at Songadh in Gujarat with a capacity of 50,000 tonnes.

 However, the production capacity of the plant might also go up to 80,000 tonnes depending on the product mix. In the current year, we expect a higher turnover by enriching our product mix, JK Papers chief financial officer and head (business strategy) Satish Mandhana said.

 The company will finance the investment with a mix of internal accruals and borrowings, he added.

 JK Paper will produce duplication board papers at the Central Pulp Mill in Gujarat.

 We have also recently commissioned an offline blade coating plant with a capacity of 45,000 tonnes per annum at its existing facility at Jaykaypur in Orissa at a cost of Rs 85 crore, he added.

 The coated paper segment has a growth rate of 12 per cent versus an overall growth of 6 per cent per annum.

 While the share of coated paper in the writing and printing segment globally is estimated at 40 per cent, in India, it is about 10 per cent. Therefore, we expect the segment to expand, said Mandhana.

 With the new plant in Orissa, the companys gross sales and profit will improve by Rs 33 crore and Rs 16 crore respectively, said Mandhana.

 Also, with the commissioning of the plant in Gujarat, the topline will increase by 33 per cent, while the bottomline will rise by 44 per cent, Mandhana added.

 In the current year, the company plans to hike its revenue share from branded products to 50 per cent from 46 per cent last year, he said.

 ITC plan

 ITC Ltd plans to invest Rs 2,500 crore during the next two to three years in putting up a green field elemental chlorine-free (ECF) paper plant, which would increase its annual paper and paperboard manufacturing capacity to 5.5 lakh tonnes.

 We are at the final stage of striking a land deal for this ECF project and looking at a possible site in Andhra, Gujarat and Maharashtra, chief executive of ITCs paper division Pradeep Dhobale said in New Delhi yesterday.

 Deal signed to restart Dabhol

 New Delhi, April 13: Indian financial institutions have reached a settlement with the consortium of offshore lenders and Overseas Private Investment Corporation of the US as efforts begin to restart the $3-billion Dabhol Power Corporation. 

 Attorney-general Milon K. Banerjee told a division bench of Justices Y. K. Sabharwal and Tarun Chatterjee, ?Domestic FIs are now negotiating a settlement with foreign partners GE and Bechtel and the proceedings are at a delicate stage.?

 The submission came during the resumed hearings of Dabhol?s petition challenging a Bombay High Court order holding that ?the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has the jurisdiction to decide disputes between the power producer and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB)?.

 Banerjee also said domestic FIs were hopeful that they would reach a settlement with the foreign partners, GE and Bechtel.

 The government is likely to unveil next month an agreement between creditors, stakeholders, the government and state-owned power utility National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), signalling the end of the protracted wrangle over the fate of the controversial 2184-megawatt Dabhol power project, which stopped generating electricity about three years ago.

 Under the terms of the agreement, which are now being hammered out, NTPC will accept the proposal by the government to help manage the power project for its existing stakeholders.

 The Dabhol power project was the first fast-track private project that was launched with a great deal of fanfare in the first flush of reforms in India. It was ridden by controversy because of counter-guarantees that the now beleaguered Enron Corporation was able to extract from the Centre.

 The project faltered after Enron collapsed amid a massive accounting scandal in the US.

 The final draft of the agreement is likely to be discussed at a meeting of the empowered group of ministers scheduled later this month. The group of ministers on power was constituted with a single agenda to resolve all the seemingly intractable issues that enveloped the Enron power project at Ratnagiri district in Maharashtra.

 Calcutta, June 14: The RPG group will undertake an organisational restructuring of its retail business. It has appointed Jitu M. Mehta, a Hindustan Lever veteran, as president of this business.

 Mehta has spent 31 years at HLL. Before joining RPG, he was executive director (ice-cream) and a member of HLL?s management committee.

 He will report to Sumantra Banerjee, who has been appointed as the CEO of RPG Retail. Banerjee has overall charge of this segment, in addition to his responsibilities of the group?s power business.

 The group has decided to use the brand name Spencer?s for all non-music related retail businesses, which include food, supermarkets and hypermarkets. Music business will be under the existing brand name ? MusicWorld.

 Mehta will be in charge of hypermarkets, supermarkets and food stores under the Spencer?s brand.

 Subrata Chowdhury, an RPG veteran, will become CEO of MusicWorld and report to Banerjee. 

 Satya Srivastav, vice-president (finance) of FoodWorld, will be the chief financial officer of the retail group. 

 K. Radhakrishnan, head (merchandising) of FoodWorld, will be the head (merchandising) of hypermarkets and supermarkets.

 Along with organisational restructuring, the group has also decided to shift the corporate headquarters of the retail business from Chennai to Calcutta. ?Once it is shifted to Calcutta, we will have direct control on the retail business,? said Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of RPG Enterprises, while announcing the organisational changes.

 Great Wholesale Club will be the holding company for RPG?s retail business. A new company is likely to be formed, which will handle the retail business.

 The RPG group had set up FoodWorld and Health amp; Glow in joint venture with Dairy Farm International (DFI). 

 However, DFI has pulled out of the venture. According to the agreement, RPG will take over 49 FoodWorld stores and the rest will remain with DFI. Health amp; Glow stores will also remain with DFI. ?The disintegration with DFI will be completed by June 30,? added Goenka.

 The RPG group wants to grow its retail business aggressively. It is targeting a Rs 3000-crore turnover by 2008-09.

 The group has finalised rollout plans for 15 hypermarkets and two supermarkets in the next 12 months. It is in the process of finalising 10 more sites.

 RPG is likely to double the food stores from 49 to 100 in the next 18 months. Calcutta will get two hypermarkets and six supermarkets.

 In this fiscal, the group plans to invest around Rs 100 crore for expanding the retail business. It is also considering a public issue or private placement of shares for its retail business. ?We may dilute 20 per cent of our stake in the retail business in the next 12 months. It may be an IPO or a private placement or a mix of both,? Goenka said.

 Goenka plans to expand the MusicWorld stores in the neighbouring countries like Singapore and Malaysia. 

 The group is also talking to a branded hypermarket chain in India for acquiring their brand as well as the infrastructure.

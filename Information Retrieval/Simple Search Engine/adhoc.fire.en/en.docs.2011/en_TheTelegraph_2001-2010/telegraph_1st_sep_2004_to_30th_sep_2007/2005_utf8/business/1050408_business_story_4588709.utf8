 Striking it while It?s Hot

 Bhubaneswar, April 7: Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd, a joint venture of state-owned MMTC and the Orissa government, will set up a 1-million tonne capacity steel plant at Kalinganagar in Jajpur district to produce long-steel products.

 The steel plant, which is part of the company?s second phase of expansion, will be completed within three years. The facility would include a bar and rod mill to make wire rods, reinforcement bars and billets.

 Neelachal Ispat chairman S. D. Kapoor, who is also the CMD of MMTC, said the total investment for the plant would be in the region of Rs 1,000 crore. It will have a 50:50 equity and debt ratio.

 The expansion project was mooted keeping an eye on the growing demand of steel in the country, especially in long products. The domestic consumption of steel during 2004-05 was expected to have risen by 7-8 per cent to reach a level of 38 million tonnes, he said.

 Announcing the provisional results of the company for 2004-05, Kapoor said in its first year of integrated operation, Neelachal Ispat posted a turnover of Rs 1,100 crore.

 The company has targeted a sales figure of Rs 1,600 crore and a net profit of Rs 150 crore for the current fiscal.

 ?We have planned to raise the production level to achieve Rs 150 crore during 2005-06,? Kapoor said.

 In the second phase of expansion, the company will also develop an iron-ore mine of 2-million tonne capacity across Sundaragarh and Keonjhar districts. The exploration work for the mine is currently at an advanced stage and it will be completed by December, 2007. 

 Kapoor said Neelachal Ispat is in the process of selecting a consultant for the steel project and has received two bids from M. N. Dastur and Mecon.

 Kapoor said last fiscal the company had supplied 24,000 million units of surplus power to Gridco, the state-owned power transmission utility. The volume of surplus power available with the company will go up four folds once the gas turbine is commissioned in the first half of this year.

 Neelachal Ispat was the single largest exporter of pig-iron from the country last year by exporting 2.78 lakh tonnes, which is 25 per cent of the country?s total pig-iron output.

 Captive production of metallurgical coke through the commissioning of the coke oven battery of Konark Met Coke Ltd, which merged with Neelachal Ispat last year, ensured further synergy in plant operations as well as in sales and financial management.

 Khaitans set McLeod merger ball rolling

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 31: The BM Khaitan group has appointed ICICI Securities and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to work out the formalities of merging Williamson Tea Assam with McLeod Russel India Ltd.

 The scheme has to be approved by the high courts of Guwahati as well as Calcutta.

 McLeod Russel vice-chairman Deepak Khaitan said the swap ratio is likely to be announced in the next 10-12 days. After the merger, Williamson Tea will cease to exist.

 The face-value of McLeod Russels shares is Rs 5; it is Rs 10 for that of Williamson Tea. The face value of the merged entitys stock will be Rs 5, Khaitan said. 

 McLeod Russel recently concluded an open offer for Williamson Teas minority shareholders, but managed to buy only around 22,000 shares (0.16 per cent). With this, the Khaitans stake in Williamson Tea has gone up to 70.16 per cent.

 After the merger, McLeod Russel will become the largest tea plantation in the world and also the biggest quality tea exporter of Assam.

 The Khaitans have decided to develop McLeod Russel as an agricultural company only, and are now preparing an alternative crop strategy, likely to be announced in April 2006.

 The company is exploring various options. We are looking at bio-diesel, bio-medicine, coffee, rice, wheat and soya. We may acquire land in states outside Assam and Bengal, he said.

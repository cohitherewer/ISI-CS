 Banks hunt for more capital avenues

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 28: Public sector banks are looking at preference shares to meet their capital requirements.

 Banks in which the government holds a 51 per cent stake cannot tap the equity market as the Centre will not dilute its ownership any further. There are also limitations on raising resources by subordinated debt or Tier II bonds.

 Under such circumstances, preference shares have emerged as the most desirable instrument. Though this is forbidden under the Banking Regulation Act, banks feel this will be allowed soon.

 The RBI is looking at some proposals submitted by banks; the government is also in favour of a solution.

 This was evident when Union finance minister P. Chidambaram said some new forms of capital would have to be identified to strengthen the capital base of PSU banks where the Centres stake is 51 per cent.

 Bankers believe this means the authorities are not against the issue of preference shares.

 In banking parlance, preference shares do not form Tier-I or core capital. Therefore, the issue of preference shares will not lead to any change in the governments equity holding in PSU banks.

 Union Bank of India chairman K. Cherian Varghese said, New instruments should qualify for Tier I as additional capital cannot be raised through rights issue or other equity offering. 

 However, bankers feel preference shares will require a fixed dividend to be paid for a long time. We have seen financial institutions, which borrowed money at high rates, face problems when rates fell, said an official.

 Banks can opt for preference shares with a fixed tenure. However, under Basel guidelines, such instruments cannot be part of Tier I capital. We hope the Basel norms are not a hindrance. For now, preference shares should be made eligible for Tier I, said the chief of a public sector bank. 

 Privatisation

 Nationalised banks would not be privatised and banking sector reforms would continue, Chidambaram said.

 Reliance top guns in power-point huddle

 Singh amp; Mukesh 

 :Talking point 

 New Delhi, May 4: Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani today met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, while cousin Nikhil Meswani conferred with finance ministry officials, sparking a buzz in the capital about the reasons for the confabulations.

 Both finance ministry and Reliance group officials tried to play down the significance of the meetings ? which are taking place just a day after an emotional outburst by brother Anil in which he accused Nikhil of overstepping his limits by briefing a section of the media about an impending settlement of the battle between the Ambani brothers.

 Sources said the meetings had been scheduled some time ago and ought not to be seen against the backdrop of the recent spate of accusations and counter-accusations between the two sides on corporate governance and ownership issues within the Rs 99,000-crore Reliance group.

 Sources said Mukesh?s meeting with the Prime Minister had been scheduled over a fortnight ago and bore no connection to the public spat between the two brothers that has raged in public since November last year.

 Meswani is believed to have met U. K. Sinha, joint secretary in the finance ministry in charge of capital markets. This meeting had also been scheduled over a week ago, sources added.

 Ambani is a member of the Prime Minister?s advisory council on trade and investment and sources close to the Mukesh camp seemed to suggest that the discussions had focused on these aspects.

 Meswani?s meeting with Sinha carried some significance, especially after Anil accused him of violating Sebi?s insider trading regulations by trying to talk up the Reliance stock with the idea that a settlement within the group was ?90 per cent complete?.

 Anil went ballistic after seeing the report and said Nikhil had no locus standi in the matter and had not been involved in any of the deliberations within the family.

 Until now, Anil has avoided bringing close relatives into the line of fire. At the recent board meeting, while objecting to several resolutions Anil had supported the proposal to renominate Hital Meswani, Nikhil?s younger brother as executive director. Nikhil and Hital are late Dhirubhai Ambani?s sister?s sons. Their father, who passed away at an early age, was closely involved in building the Reliance edifice along with Dhirubhai. 

 The two Meswani brothers are actively involved in managing the Reliance empire and have the complete confidence of Mukesh.

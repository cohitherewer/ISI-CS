 Rupee still on strong ground 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 21: The government considers the rupee to be robust despite its recent fall against the dollar.

 As on October 18, the rupee is still strong despite some nominal depreciation. In terms of real effective exchange rate (REER), the rupee is reasonably a strong currency, finance minister P. Chidambaram said at a function organised by Assocham. 

 The rupee has appreciated 4.4 per cent against the euro, 3.5 per cent against the pound, 4.3 per cent against the yen, even though it had fallen 3.1 per cent against the dollar, he said.

 The finance ministers statement comes on the back of a debate within the government over whether a central bank intervention or an interest rate hike was needed to prop up the rupee or whether it should be allowed to depreciate further to prop up exports. 

 North Block officials said strong intervention by the central bank was not warranted as yet as REER of the rupee was nearly 7 per cent over-valued. The rupee, in fact, recovered smartly today ? having slid 3 per cent this month ? as fund managers bought the currency to invest in stocks. 

 However, there are fears that as foreign funds close their yearly accounts and try to book profits, there would be sale of Indian stocks and repatriation of dollars. 

 The greenback would also be in demand from state-run oil firms as winter demand would force up crude rates. 

 Chidambaram said he was confident that FII inflows would remain strong.

 Anil opens window to internet television

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 7: Microsoft chairman Bill Gates today met Reliance Infocomm chief Anil Ambani and discussed his ambitious internet protocol TV project. 

 The project, envisaged in 2003, will let Reliance Infocomm leverage its nationwide high-speed fibre optic cable infrastructure to deliver a specialised set of services using the IPTV technology.

 I had a chance to meet Anil Ambani today. We will now help his firm in rolling out broadband services. He has a strategy in place, and we will play a key role in that, Gates said. 

 We are putting renewed energy into the (IPTV) tie-up, he added. 

 Using Microsofts IPTV solution, telephone and cable companies can deliver high-quality video content and services to their subscribers by using two-way broadband networks. 

 Reliances customers would be able to surf the Net, send e-mails and play on-line games with multiple users. It would also allow subscribers to access numerous channels over Reliances broadband network.

 The IPTV solution is designed to combine industry and Microsoft innovations in supporting services that pay-TV operators offer today. These include standard-and high-definition channels, on-demand programming, and interactive program guides, with enhanced features such as instant channel changing. 

 The solution will also help new next-generation services, including picture-in-picture functionality, using multiple video streams.

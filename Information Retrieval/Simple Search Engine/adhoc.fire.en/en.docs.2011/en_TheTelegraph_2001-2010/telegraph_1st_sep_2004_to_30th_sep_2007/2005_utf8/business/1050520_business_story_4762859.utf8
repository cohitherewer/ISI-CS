 Cabinet seal on plan review

 New Delhi, May 19: The Union cabinet today cleared the Planning Commissions mid-term appraisal (MTA) of the Tenth Five-year Plan, which called for minority stake sales in profitable PSUs through the market, labour reforms and opening up retail to FDI. It also suggested stepping up investment in infrastructure and social sectors and scaling down customs rates further to make industry competitive. 

 Despite the cabinet nod, the appraisal is likely to run into rough weather as the Left parties have made it clear they are not happy with the governments view on labour reforms. They call it one-sided, benefiting only the employers. Nor are these parties willing to give up their opposition to allowing FDI in retail chains. 

 However, the plan panel prescription has scaled down economic growth targets from 8.1 per cent to between 7 and 8 per cent annually during the remaining two years of the plan. Given the new target, the economy has to grow at over 7.5 per cent. 

 The appraisal, which will serve as a blueprint for future action, will be placed before the National Development Council next month. 

 Explaining why the growth target has been reduced, finance minister P. Chidambaram said: The mid-term appraisal shows the actual growth achieved in the last three years. We are not scaling down growth.

 In the first year (2002-03), growth was just 4 per cent, the minister said. GDP grew by 8.5 per cent in 2003-04 and the growth rate is estimated to be 6.9 per cent in 2004-05. 

 The appraisal has 58 policy prescriptions, one of which is the call to mop up adequate revenues by selling minority stakes in profit-making PSUs. The document, which seems to have kept the Lefts sensibilities in mind, has insists the government retain a 51 per cent stake in profitable PSUs while divesting its holding.

 The plan panel document also calls for further relaxing the FDI norms in key sectors like telecom, insurance and aviation, besides allowing it in retail. It also recommends that contract farming be made legal so that companies can tap the countrys agriculture potential.

 The list includes potentially troublesome issues such as easier exit and entry norms for the industry, pruning small scale industry reservation, while giving them sops like cheaper credit and privatisation of coal mining.

 The document also stresses the need to step up investment in infrastructure, including railways, ports, roads and airports.

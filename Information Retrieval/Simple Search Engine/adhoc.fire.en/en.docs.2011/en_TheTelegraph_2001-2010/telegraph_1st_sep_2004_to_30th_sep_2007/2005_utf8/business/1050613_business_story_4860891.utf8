 Profit paranoia stands in way of export tide to Pakistan

 Islamabad, June 12: Multinational corporations dominating the Pakistani economy pose a formidable barrier to cheap Indian goods that could be marketed in the country. 

 Senior Pakistani journalists say MNCs raking in huge profits have a vested interest in keeping cheaper Indian goods out of the market and on the list of goods that cannot be imported.

 Nowhere is this more evident than in the pharmaceutical industry. The Pakistanis have to pay five to six times more for branded drugs that are marketed by multinational companies compared with the Indian consumers who buy the same medicine produced indigenously and sold in generic form (unbranded).

 The advantage of reverse-engineering that the Indian pharmaceutical industry exploited to produce cheaper medicines could be passed on to Pakistani consumers if these goods were removed from the negative list.

 Similarly, Indian tractors and farm machinery are much cheaper than what Pakistan imports from the West. Mechanisation levels in agriculture and farm productivity would increase significantly if Pakistani farmers buy the more affordable Indian tractors.

 Most of the cars and heavy vehicles in Pakistan are imported from Japan. Indian heavy vehicles manufactured by the Tatas or Ashok Leyland would cost much less and would be cheaper to maintain. This would give the transport sector a much-needed kick-start.

 Japanese majors like Toyota, Honda and Suzuki are providing Pakistan with the latest cars. However, these are imported in knocked down form and assembled in the country. Such operations cannot generate much employment for the nation; nor can this lead to the backward linkages that engender auto component firms.

 The editor of Pakistan?s Daily News, Najam Sethi, says while multinationals did have a hand in keeping Indian goods out, India, too, have to give more concessions to Pakistani imports if it wants a slice of the pie.

 India claims it has given the most-favoured nation status to Pakistan in trade. In practice however, the actual tariff levels have tended to be much higher. Pakistani exporters are, therefore, not really gaining. 

 ?There is a general impression that India will benefit more from open trade between the two countries than Pakistan. This concern needs to be addressed,? he added.

 General Mehmood Ali Durrani, who is a member of Track II Indo-Pak diplomatic effort to promote peace, told The Telegraph that he discerned a change in the mood of both nations and that this should be used to build stronger economic ties. 

 He said the tide of hope and goodwill sweeping the region would lead to a cut in defence expenditure on both sides. This, in turn, would further boost the economies of the two countries and lead to higher levels of mutually advantageous trade.

 ICICI Bank profit rises 18%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 17: ICICI Bank has posted an 18 per cent rise in second-quarter net profit at Rs 518 crore against Rs 440 crore in the corresponding previous period.

 The bank?s loan book looks healthy with a 32 per cent rise in total advances to Rs 76,092 crore compared with Rs 57,812 crore in the year-ago period. 

 On the BSE today, the ICICI Bank scrip opened at Rs 356 and rose to an intra-day high of Rs 357.95 after the results were announced. The share later closed weak at Rs 351.95.

 Retail assets grew 63 per cent to Rs 46,194 crore in the reporting quarter from Rs 28,265 crore. 

 The bank disbursed home loans worth Rs 13,147 crore in the nine-month period to December. 

 While retail loans have been a major driver in banking sector credit growth, there are indications of a pick up in industrial credit as well, the bank said. Analysts attribute this trend to the growth in the manufacturing sector as the Indian economy remains in an upbeat mode.

 Another positive for the bank was the growth in core net interest income, which rose 43 per cent to Rs 733 crore from Rs 513 crore in the same period last year. With the cost of funds coming down, the net interest margin also showed a gain. However, treasury income dropped 48 per cent to Rs 199 crore (Rs 391 crore) during the quarter. 

 In the April-December period, the bank repaid about Rs 5,000 crore of ICICI?s liabilities.

 Total deposits during the quarter rose 35 per cent to Rs 81,928 crore (Rs 60,872 crore). Net restructured assets were at Rs 6,792 crore, down from Rs 7,410 crore in the same period last year. Net non-performing assets constitute 2.3 per cent of customer assets, down from 4.7 per cent.

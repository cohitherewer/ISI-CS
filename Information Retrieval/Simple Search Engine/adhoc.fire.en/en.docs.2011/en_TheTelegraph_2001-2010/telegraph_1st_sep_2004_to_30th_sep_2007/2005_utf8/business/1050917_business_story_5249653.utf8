 PSU board hopefuls in screen test

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will have to tweak rules to ensure his party colleagues can sit on the boards of public sector oil companies or BHEL as non-official and independent directors.

 The department of public enterprises has not cleared a list of politicians sent by the petroleum ministry because the candidates fell short of the eligibility criteria.

 Existing guidelines allow only senior bureaucrats ? those having spent at least 10 years as joint secretary ?eminent professors, technocrats, institute heads and corporate leaders as independent directors on PSU boards.

 The department has written to the Prime Minister suggesting changes in norms so that eminent persons from other walks of life can also join the ranks of eminent professors, leading corporate heads and technocrats considered good enough to get PSU board slots.

 On August 30, the ministry had asked the department to set aside its June 9 selection of candidates and convene a fresh meeting to consider a line-up of 35 hopefuls, most of whom were Congress leaders.

 The gaggle of Congress ex-MPs, MLAs and leaders of the youth and womens wings of the party could not get past the departments initial screening. The search committee, comprising the Public Enterprises Selection Board chairman and the department of public enterprises secretary, would have scrutinised the nominees against the prescribed criteria and sent the final list to the cabinet committee on appointments for approval.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said the leaders had sent him their bio-data for consideration as non-official directors. I have merely forwarded their bio-data to the department of public enterprises, he added. He said candidates picked by the departments search panel would be appointed in line with standard procedures.

 If they do not fulfil the eligibility criteria, they will not be appointed because they belong to the Congress party. There is no question of any pressure from the petroleum ministry on the issue as under existing rules, it is the department that selects directors, he added. Non-official directors attend board meetings and are expected to give suggestions to improve the functioning of the company by providing a wider input.

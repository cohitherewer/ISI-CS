 Calcutta, Feb. 4: The Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA) is likely to conduct a feasibility study in April to set up cargo-handling facilities at Sagar near Sandheads.

 A decision will be taken on the proposed project after the feasibility report comes through, Calcutta Port Trust chairman A. K. Chanda said at a seminar on ?shipping?s role in the resurgence of the east? organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI).

 Around Rs 8.3 crore has been outlined for the mooring berth at the Sagar anchorage under the Tenth Five Year Plan. 

 The dock at Sagar has been a longstanding project and was proposed by the Indian Institute of Port Management (IIPM) in 2001. It was suggested that the Calcutta port develop three moorings instead of two. The proposed location lies at a distance of 14 kms from the western bank of Sagar and 145 kms from the Calcutta dock system.

 Calcutta Port Trust director (P amp;R) S. K. Mondal said a total outlay of Rs 768 crore had been set aside for the modernisation and upgradation of the port infrastructure. Of this, Rs 303 crore will be funded through internal resources and Rs 465 crore through grant-in-aids.

 He said with 46 million tonnes of cargo handled in 2004-05, which is a 13 per cent increase over the previous year, the Calcutta port has moved into the second position after Vishakhapatnam. 

 ?The port, which handled 41.26 million tonnes cargo in 2003-04 and ranked third, is expected to increase the cargo throughput to 46 million tonnes during the current fiscal,? he said.

 The average growth of traffic at the Calcutta port for the period between April and December 2004 was 12.78 per cent against 11.08 per cent recorded by other major ports.

 Reddy gets a pat from India Inc

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 25: India Inc today hailed the Reserve Banks busy season credit policy that kept the interest costs stable and tried to suck out the excess liquidity from the market. It has cautioned banks about lending to doubtful borrowers by raising the repo rates and the reverse repo rates. 

 The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) have said a 25 basis point increase in the reverse repo rate is justifiable and practical in view of the global and domestic market realities. The US Federal Reserve has also raised interest rates. 

 In the local market, fresh bad loans have been piling up, especially in the housing sector. 

 However, Assocham has called for an increase in bank rates as well. It would have been appreciated if the RBI had increased the bank rate by 25 basis points, said Anil K. Agarwal, the newly elected president of Assocham. 

 The industry feels that the central banks optimism is reflected in the revised GDP growth rate of 7-7.5 per cent and a projected stable inflation rate. This (projected) growth performance is all the more creditable as it (will) come during a period when global economic growth is expected to decline, though marginally from 5.1 per cent to 4.3 per cent, said Y.C. Deveshwar, CII president.

 With global oil prices showing some signs of stability, the RBIs policy should help maintain the domestic price stability, said Onkar S. Kanwar, Ficci president.

 India Inc has also welcomed the Reserve Banks decision not to change the cash reserve ratio.

 Chambers have appreciated the central banks efforts to boost lending to small and medium term enterprises and double the corpus of micro finance development and equity fund to Rs 200 crore. A clear definition on medium scale operations will also provide banks with the much needed clarity, Ficci said.

 Similarly, the cluster financing approach will help enhance flow of funds more efficiently. This will help banks not only finance but also develop a relationship management with SMEs, said a Ficci spokesperson.

 According to Assocham, for a wider customer base, all banks need to have basic no frill accounts either with nil or very low minimum balances as well as charges that would make such accounts accessible to vast sections of the population.

 India Inc also appreciated the elaboration of the road map for implementing the Basel II norms.

 By adding new forms of capital to Tier I and Tier II, India has moved a step ahead in matching international standards and provided additional flexibility to banks in meeting their capital requirements, Kanwar said.

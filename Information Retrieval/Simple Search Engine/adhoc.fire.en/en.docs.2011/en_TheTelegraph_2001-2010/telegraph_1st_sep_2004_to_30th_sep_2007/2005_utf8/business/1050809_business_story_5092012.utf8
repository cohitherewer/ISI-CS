 Moodys wants more clarity on de-merger

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 8: Moodys Investor Service will continue to review Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) for a possible upgrade of its Ba2 ratings. The global rating agency, however, requires greater clarity on the de-merger plan to conclude its review.

 Moodys did not specify the areas in which it wanted more details. In June, Moodys said even as the potential financial impact of the settlement between the Ambani brothers was uncertain, any review for upgrading RILs rating will depend on further details.

 Last week, Mukesh Ambani brother announced that RIL will de-merge its holdings in power, financial and telecom services as part of settlement with younger brother Anil.

 However, Mukesh did not spell out the details of the demerger plan, which is being worked out by Crisil, Deloitte Haskins and Sells, J. M. Morgan Stanley and Amarchand and Mangaldas and Suresh A. Shroff and Co.

 A rating upgrade will enable the company to raise funds at a cheaper rate from the market and reduce costs.

 RIL plans to invest Rs 25,000 crore to double the refining capacity in Jamnagar to 60 million tonnes per annum by 2008-09. It will pump Rs 17,600 crore into oil exploration over five years.

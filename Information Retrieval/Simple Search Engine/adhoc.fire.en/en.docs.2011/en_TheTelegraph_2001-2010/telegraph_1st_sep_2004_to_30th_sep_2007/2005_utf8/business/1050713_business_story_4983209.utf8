The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Shrachi firm eyes 50% growth

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Todi: Big plans

 Calcutta, July 12: Shrachi group-owned Bengal Tools Ltd is eyeing a 50 per cent revenue growth this fiscal from the sales of its power tillers.

 The company is targeting a business of Rs 30 crore from its agro division during 2005-06 compared with Rs 20 crore achieved last year.

 We are looking for a business of Rs 30 crore by selling 2,500 power tillers against 1,800 units sold last fiscal. We expect to achieve an overall turnover of Rs 40-45 crore in 2005-06, said Ravi Todi, managing director, Bengal Tools. 

 For the year ended March 31, Bengal Tools clocked a total turnover of Rs 32 crore.

 The company has two divisions ? agro and engineering. The agro division imports power tillers from Zhejiang Sifang group of China and sells them here. The division imports the tillers in semi-knocked down condition and assemble them at its facilities in Calcutta and Bangalore.

 In India, power tillers are allowed exclusively for agricultural use, thereby limiting its growth, while China and many other countries use power tillers for agriculture as well as transportation.

 Of the total market of about 15,000 tillers per annum in India (power tiller market is 1 million units in China), local-made tillers sold 12,000 units last year and the rest were Chinese imports.

 Despite attracting an overall 30 per cent duty, the China-made power tillers are still 10-15 per cent cheaper than the India makes. Bengal Tools has recently launched one more model to boost its sales. 

 Sifang group president Lin Guangping, who was recently in India country, said it would consider setting up a manufacturing facility here as and when the market matures. Sifang sells power tillers in 55 countries.

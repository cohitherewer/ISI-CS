 Qwest sweetens MCI offer

 rich deal

 Washington, March 17 (Reuters): Qwest Communications International Inc plans to hike its takeover bid for MCI Inc to $8.45 billion in a move to scuttle the long-distance telephone company?s existing deal with Verizon Communications Inc, sources close to the situation said on Wednesday. 

 The new offer values MCI at about $26 a share, up 7.4 per cent from its earlier offer of $24.20 per share, sources said. The proposal will include more cash than the previous offer.

 MCI and Qwest declined to comment. Ashburn, Virginia-based MCI had rejected Qwest?s previous overtures in favour of a lower $6.49 billion acquisition offer from Verizon, the nation?s largest telephone company.

 Several large MCI shareholders have balked at the Verizon price and urged the carrier to reconsider a richer deal with Qwest. Verizon had given MCI until March 17 to discuss a potential merger with its rival suitor.

 Verizon on Wednesday slammed Qwest, saying the local telephone company was making a ?desperate? attempt to buy MCI. In a letter filed with federal market regulators, Verizon chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg said accounting scandals at Qwest and WorldCom, which later became known as MCI, had been driven in part by unrealistic merger promises.

 He said Qwest?s bid had ?a desperate quality?, and that its claims of $14.8 billion in savings from a MCI deal ?do not pass a common sense test?.

 ?Qwest fails to explain the financial alchemy required to keep Qwest afloat, complete the acquisition of MCI and invest in the business,? Seidenberg said in the letter.

 Verizon contended that if Qwest tried to raise its offer with more cash, the combined Qwest-MCI would be stretched too thin and have difficulty refinancing and paying off debt, paying severance costs for layoffs and keeping a cash cushion for network investments and upgrades.

 Qwest argued that its bid is a better deal for MCI shareholders, and that a Verizon-MCI purchase along with SBC Communications? pending purchase of AT amp;T Corp, would create a duopoly in the market.

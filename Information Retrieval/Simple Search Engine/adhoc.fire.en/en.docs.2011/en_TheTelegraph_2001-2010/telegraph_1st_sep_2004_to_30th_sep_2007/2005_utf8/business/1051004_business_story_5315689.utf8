 HSBC Global ups stake in CESC by 4%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 3: HSBC Global Investment has increased its stake in CESC by 4 per cent.

 The company has acquired 33.2 lakh shares aggregating 4.03 per cent of the total paid-up capital of CESC through HSBC Global Investment Funds (Mauritius). 

 The mode of acquisition was through global depository share (GDS) offering.

 The shareholding of HSBC Global after the acquisition is 68.69 lakh shares aggregating 8.33 per cent of the total paid-up capital of the private power utility.

 CESC has successfully placed GDS worth $40 million on September 27. 

 The company will issue 7,930,685 GDS representing approximately 9.6 per cent of the post-offer equity share capital.

 The proceeds from the offering will be used primarily to set up the third generating unit of 250 mw at its existing power station at Budge Budge.

 The total cost of the project is Rs 1,000 crore, which will be funded through an equity infusion of Rs 300 crore and a debt of Rs 700 crore.

 The company has also signed up with the Jharkhand government for setting up a 1,000 mw thermal power plant in the state. The total cost of the project is estimated to be around Rs 4,000 crore.

 The company also expects to sign an MoU with the Orissa government shortly for setting up a 2,000-mw thermal power plant at a cost of Rs 8,000 crore.

 The company has also firmed up plans to set up a greenfield 1,000-mw power plant at Haldia in Bengal. The Haldia Development Authority has already granted 1,000 acres. The company will soon start a detailed project report for the proposed plant. 

 The company had approached the overseas market with the GDS offer on September 30. The GDS were issued at a price of little over $5 per GDS.

 Mukesh: Root cause

 Mumbai, Jan. 12: The Reliance group plans to strengthen its traditional base in Gujarat. The company will invest in gas distribution projects in 13 towns, a port-based special economic zone and a university in the state, chairman Mukesh Ambani said today. 

 He was speaking at the inauguration of Vibrant Gujarat: Global Investors Summit 2005, in Ahmedabad. 

 Ambani recalled Reliance?s journey from its cradle of Naroda in Gujarat. The group now has investments of over Rs 50,000 crore in the state. 

 It wants to set up institutions for higher education in Gujarat and bring about a digital revolution through the convergence of information technology and communications. It will provide relief operations in times of natural calamities and drinking water to semi-arid regions.

 The group is actively working with the state on three major initiatives ? a gas distribution project for 13 cities and towns, a port-based special economic zone and a university.

 The Vibrant Gujarat Summit was inaugurated by the vice president of India, Bhairon Singh Shekawat. L. K. Advani and Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi were also present.

 Ambani said the group keeps coming back to the state to invest and contribute to its industrial and social development. Reliance?s tryst with Gujarat is an expression of its commitment and faith in the state and people, he added.

 During the Vibrant Gujarat summit in 2003, Reliance had announced projects worth Rs 9,300 crore. Most of these are on track, with investments of over Rs 2,100 crore already completed and commissioned, Ambani added.

 Another Rs 3,800 crore has already been committed to ongoing projects.

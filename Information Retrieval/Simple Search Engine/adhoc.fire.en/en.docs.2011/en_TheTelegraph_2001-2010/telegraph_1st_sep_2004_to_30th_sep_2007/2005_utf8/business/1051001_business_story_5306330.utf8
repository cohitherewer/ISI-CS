 Foreigners give tourism a crude shock

 Slippery ground

 New Delhi, Sept. 30: The foreign tourist inflow into the country has started to slow down, and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) is blaming it on the surge in global crude oil prices.

 The international agency says the month of August saw a weak growth both in cargo and passenger traffic. While the growth in passenger traffic dipped to 6.1 per cent last month from a robust 8.5 per cent in July, the growth in cargo traffic during the month came down to 2.8 per cent.

 Tour operators and travel agents echo IATA?s view. They maintain that foreign tourist inflow had risen to 3.36 million in calendar 2004, representing a year-on-year growth of 23.5 per cent. But the August numbers are a clear indication that the hike in aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices has started to force travellers to modify plans. Most airlines are now tagging on an additional surcharge to ticket prices, which is dampening tourists? enthusiasm.

 IATA said, ?This is the first indication of a slower demand for passenger services. It appears that the rise in oil and gasoline prices is damaging consumer confidence.? 

 Subhash Goyal, president of Indian Association of Tour Operators (IATO), said, ?It is not only the fuel cost which is causing a slowdown in passenger traffic, but also the high room rates that Indian hoteliers are charging.?

 The large hotel chains have raised room rates by 50 to 60 per cent over those prevailing in August 2004. ?India?s growing importance in the world economy and lack of two and three-star hotels are encouraging hoteliers to do so,? Goyal added.

 As for comparisons between travel expenses in India and in neighbouring countries, a tour operator said, ?India is an expensive country for tourism. Hence, we see a clear trend ? international travellers prefer to travel to Sri Lanka, Singapore and Malaysia.? 

 Prabhat Mehra, manager, leisure travel-inbound, Thomas Cook India, said, ?Our observation is that inbound travel has definitely gone down in the months of August and September. However, the difference is still not very sharp in comparison with the corresponding period last year.?

 According to him, August was a good month both in terms of availability of hotel rooms and increase in corporate travel.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 18: Indiabulls has recorded a net profit of Rs 56.7 crore in 2004-05, a rise of 193 per cent over previous year. 

 Total revenue of the leading Internet brokerage that aims to transform itself into a non-banking financial company rose by 134 per cent to Rs 168.4 crore from Rs 71.9 crore. Profit before tax at Rs 90 crore was higher by 191 per cent from Rs 30.9 crore in 2003-04.

 Indiabulls shares fell 3.9 per cent to Rs 107.70 in line with the bearish market sentiments despite its good performance.

 For the quarter ended March 31, 2005, the net profit rose 290 per cent at Rs 23.9 crore compared with Rs 6.1 crore in the year-ago period.

 Indiabulls almost tripled its annual net profit in 2004-05 as the company continued its strong growth trajectory. 

 ?The good results are a testimony to the excellent execution by the company and the large opportunity present in the domestic retail finance market. Our high operating efficiencies, strong technology backbone and operational excellence have propelled us to record revenues, profit and margins,? chairman and CEO Sameer Gehlaut said.

 The company achieved many milestones in 2004-05. It completed its GDR offering, oversubscribed approximately five times, and raised Rs 261.8 crore of equity capital.

 Indiabulls has also launched consumer finance business, completed the first securitisation deal in the personal loan segment, and raised Rs 87.6 crore equity capital from Farallon Capital for a 33.3 per cent stake.

 Its initial public offering was oversubscribed approximately 21 times. 

 The company is in the process of rolling the consumer finance business across the country, and expects it to be a major driver of growth and profitability in 2005-06.

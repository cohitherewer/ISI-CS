The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Own little roof over red-hot rooms

 My First Home - Koena Mitra, 

 Actor

 When I first came to Mumbai, I 

 lived as a paying guest for four months before I took a 

 place on rent near Carter Road in Bandra. It was quite a 

 prime location and a very good locality. Little did I know 

 then that one day I would actually buy that place and that 

 would be my first home.

 At the time when I was seriously 

 looking for a place to buy, my landlord came and said: ?Why 

 are you paying so much as rent every month? Why don?t you 

 buy out the place?? He was really confident that I would 

 be able to take care of the place and so I went ahead and 

 bought it.

 It?s a simple flat with a bedroom, 

 a hall and a kitchen. Since I live alone, the space doesn?t 

 really matter. With very little furniture, I find that one 

 room quite spacious.

 I am a complete gadgets freak. 

 So I have this big television, big speakers, DVD players 

 and all. It?s like a mini theatre, my home. And then you 

 also have the fridge and microwave oven in the kitchen.

 In the hall, I have these really 

 low gaddis, which are foldable and can be pulled 

 out into beds. Everything in my room is red. The walls are 

 white, the gadgets are grey and the rest is red. The gaddis, 

 the cupboards, the curtains ? it?s red all over.

 The bedroom just has this one 

 bed and two cupboards stuck to the wall. The bed-sheets 

 keep changing ? I like them in bright colours.

 The bedroom, in fact, is a blend 

 of wood ? the cupboards have a wooden finish ? and bright 

 colours. I also have this big wall-sized mirror in my bedroom, 

 which makes the room look quite big.

 I never got hold of any interior 

 designer or anything. I took pride in decking up the place 

 on my own.

 In Mumbai, the most important 

 thing is to get hold of a place and a car. And then you 

 are set. So I didn?t exactly get hold of my first home because 

 I was passionate about flats and houses. It was just important 

 for me to have my own roof here in Mumbai.

 I am quite happy with my little 

 place. But I am also planning on something bigger and better 

 in the near future. 

 Ideally it should be in Juhu or 

 Andheri because that?s where all the studios, Filmistans 

 and Filmalayas, are. So I will be able to save a lot on 

 travel time. Right now, though, it?s all Bandra for me.

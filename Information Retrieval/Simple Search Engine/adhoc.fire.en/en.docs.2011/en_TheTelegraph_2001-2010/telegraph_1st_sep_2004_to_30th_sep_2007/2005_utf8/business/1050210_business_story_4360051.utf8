 Bajaj Auto hauls UTI to court over scheme closure

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Caught in a storm

 Mumbai, Feb. 9: Bajaj Auto has moved Mumbai High Court to restrain UTI from winding up a scheme in which it has invested Rs 80 crore and challenged a Sebi decree that forced the mutual fund to do so.

 Bajaj Auto has argued that the premature closure of Growth amp; Value Fund-Bonus Plan is not in the interest of investors like itself. One of the country?s largest two-wheeler makers that also straddles life and general insurance, the company is one of those sitting on a massive cash pile, which is stashed away in a variety of investment avenues. The money, put at Rs 4000 crore, is parked in equity and fixed-income securities, giving the firm a much-needed financial buffer for its mainstay business.

 What upset Bajaj was a Sebi rule called the 20:25 norm. Under this, a mutual fund must have at least 20 investors, none of whose funds should account for more than 25 per cent of its corpus. UTI?s Growth amp; Value Fund ? Bonus Plan was among the many schemes that fell foul of the norm.

 ?In terms of the Sebi circular of February 1, notices to close the scheme were issued. Two investors, Bajaj Auto and Vinod Agarwal, have challenged the wind-up order through a writ petition in Mumbai High Court,? UTI MF said in a late-evening release issued today.

 UTI, UTI Mutual Fund, UTI Trustee Company Pvt Ltd, UTI Asset Management Company Pvt Ltd and Sebi have been named as respondents in the suit, which will be heard on Thursday by Justice A. P. Shah and Justice S. A. Vajifdar.

 In its petition, Bajaj Auto has argued that winding up the Bonus Plan within a year from date of allotment on March 26, 2004 will force unit holders to pay extra tax and interest, besides defeating the purpose of the scheme. 

 Though the 20:25 rule is under fire now, Sebi had devised it for small investors. What pushed the market regulator to frame the rule was the practice of funds catering to affluent individuals and corporate investors with plans that were more like portfolio management schemes.

 The petition contends that more than 1,100 investors of UTI?s Bonus Plan are now running the risk of their tax planing going haywire after the scheme?s closure last month. Apart from Bajaj Auto, two investors from Jaipur and Pune have lodged separate suits to fight the move.

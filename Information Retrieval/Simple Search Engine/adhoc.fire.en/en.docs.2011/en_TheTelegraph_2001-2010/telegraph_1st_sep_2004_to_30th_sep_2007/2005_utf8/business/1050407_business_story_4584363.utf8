 New Delhi, April 6 (PTI): US carrier Continental Airlines plans to launch a daily non-stop flight between Delhi and New York from November, provided the government approved its flight schedules.

 The announcement comes about 10 days ahead of the scheduled signing of a fresh Indo-US bilateral air traffic agreement, which would virtually allow ?open sky? operations to multiple airlines in both countries.

 Announcing the daily direct flight from November 1, Continental vice-president Jim Summerford said, ?We will be able to offer Indian trans-Atlantic travellers something none of our competitors can match ? an award winning non-stop service to New York.?

 Refusing to divulge the fare structure, he said the airline would operate Boeing-777s in a two-class configuration, carrying 48 passengers in business first class and 235 in the economy.

 The total flight time would be about 16 hours westwards and 14 hours eastbound with the aircraft operating over the North Pole and the travellers saving about three hours of transit time.

 According to the tentative schedule, the flight to New York would start at 2330 hours from Delhi and reach at 0450 hours next day. The return flight would depart New York at 2105 hours arriving at 2130 hours next day.

 Continental Airlines has over 3,000 daily departures serving 152 domestic and 122 international destinations. It is a member of the Skyteam Alliance of Airlines.

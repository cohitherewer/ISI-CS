The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Investsmart aims high

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 6: IL amp;FS Investsmart Ltd wants to spread its overseas wing and introduce more financial services besides share brokerage that it is offering at present, but the current regulations have clipped it. 

 Once the regulatory permissions are in place, the company intends to set up five foreign branches in Dubai, Hong Kong, Singapore, New York and London, said Girish Nadkarni, chief operating officer, IL amp;FS Investsmart Ltd. Besides these, the finance company also has plans to expand its overseas branch network to 47 from 30 at present over a period of three years. We have estimated a total cost of Rs 16 crore for setting up all the branches, Nadkarni mentioned.

 We plan to introduce portfolio management services, commodity brokerage, project financing and other structured products in the international market and are waiting for the required regulations to fall in place. To start with, we shall offer share brokerage services in our overseas branches, he added.

 The retail sector has been the major driver of IL amp;FS Investsmarts business in the last couple of years. In the last fiscal, retail brokerage and portfolio management services contributed 70.96 per cent of the total income of the company. In the previous fiscal, it was a little higher at 88 per cent.

 The proceeds from the public equity offer of 1.14 crore shares, which opens for subscription on July 4, will be utilised to finance its branch expansion plan. The price band of the issue has been fixed at Rs 110 and Rs 125. The offer will close on July 8.

 The net offer to the public constitutes 23.42 per cent of the paid-up capital of the company post offer. The proceeds will also be invested in technology, online businesses and subsidiaries. Part of it would be used as working capital.

 Mutual funds go on a buying spree

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Calcutta, May 10: Mutual funds are on a buying binge.

 In the whole of 2004-05, the funds made net purchases worth Rs 448.02 crore in the equity market. In sharp contrast, in the first 40 days of the current financial year, the figure was Rs 2,156.21 crore.

 In April, the net purchases in the equity market was Rs 1,464.91 crore, while till May 9, the funds bought stocks worth Rs 691.33 crore.

 Does this mean that net inflows in the equity schemes have not been as much as touted by the industry?

 SBI Mutual Fund chief investment officer Sethuram Iyer said, ?In the last financial year, the net inflows in equity funds have not been substantial. The major appreciation in the assets under management of the mutual funds was brought about by an increase in the value of the portfolio.?

 ?The equity funds on an average have posted a return of almost 35 to 40 per cent last fiscal, which would attribute largely to the surge of corpus managed by the fund houses,? he added.

 Iyer said though a number of initial public offers in mutual funds hit the market last year, the really large ones were on offer during the year-end.

 However, the funds mobilised in those schemes were not invested in the market because of its high levels and were held in cash or short-term instruments.

 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) allows maiden funds to invest their corpus in the market within a timeframe of six months.

 ?Therefore, the amounts mobilised in the big bang IPOs are being invested at the current levels in the market, which has resulted in such high net purchase figures,? added Iyer.

 Since January 2005, as many as 20 equity funds have been launched, including two index funds, with almost Rs 10,000 crore being mobilised through them.

 The larger grossers among them are the Franklin Flexicap fund with Rs 1,950 crore, Reliance Equity Opportunities with Rs 1,773 crore and Fidelity Equity Fund at around Rs 1,500 crore.

 On March 31, 2004, the total assets under management of different equity and equity-oriented schemes was Rs 37,484.49 crore. This amount increased by 20 per cent to Rs 44,956.33 crore on March 31, 2005.

 Of this, assets under the pure diversified funds was Rs 19,000.38 crore at the end of fiscal 2004 and Rs 32,592.42 crore at the end of the last financial year.

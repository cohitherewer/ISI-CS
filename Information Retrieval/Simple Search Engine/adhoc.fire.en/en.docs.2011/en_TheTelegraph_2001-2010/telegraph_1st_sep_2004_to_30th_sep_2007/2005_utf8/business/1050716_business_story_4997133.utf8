 Bonanza hope fires up RIL stock

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 15: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) saw hectic activity on the bourses today because of speculation that investors would walk away with sizeable number of shares of Reliance Capital and yet-to-be listed Reliance Infocomm.

 The RIL scrip emerged as a winner on the BSE as investors made a beeline for the stocks. The scrip, after opening at Rs 645, shot to an intra-day high of Rs 669.65 and ended at Rs 666.60, a gain of Rs 24.50 over its last close. The RIL stock contributed significantly to the 83.84-point increase in the sensex, which closed at 7187.70.

 According to the settlement formula of the Reliance empire, while elder brother Mukesh Ambani got control over RIL and Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd (IPCL), younger brother Anil was given Reliance Energy Ltd (REL), Reliance Infocomm and Reliance Capital Ltd (RCL).

 As RIL has stakes in companies that are now under Anil, reports suggest that investors will get shares of these companies. It is understood that RIL will demerge its holdings in REL, RCL and Reliance Infocomm into investment companies or SPVs, which will be listed. These SPVs will then be merged with their respective operating companies.

 The annual general meeting of RIL will be held on August 3. So, there is intense speculation that investors of RIL will get a number of shares of Reliance Infocomm, RCL and REL, a broker said. 

 Another reason for investors chasing the RIL scrip was the expectation that it will not have to share the oil-subsidy burden.

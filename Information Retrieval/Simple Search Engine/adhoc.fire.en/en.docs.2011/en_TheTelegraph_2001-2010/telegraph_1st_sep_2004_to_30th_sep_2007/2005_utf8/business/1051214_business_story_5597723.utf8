 Fed set to raise interest rates

 Washington, Dec. 13 (Reuters): US Federal Reserve officials gathered on Tuesday for a meeting that seemed certain to end with a 13th straight interest-rate hike and possibly a signal that a one-and-a-half year rate-rise campaign was winding down.

 The US central bank is widely expected to bump up overnight borrowing costs by a quarter-percentage point to 4.25 per cent. It also may alter long-standing language in its post-meeting statement offering guidance on its policy path.

 The policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee began meeting at 9 am (1400 GMT), a Fed official said, as Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan nears the end of his 18-year tenure. An announcement on rates is expected at 2:15 pm (1715 GMT).

 While analysts think the Fed will signal the rate cycle is not yet done, many believe it will change how it characterises policy to recognise how far rates have risen since the cycle began in June 2004.

 The central bank has stuck fast to one description of policy and the expected policy path throughout its campaign, saying the benchmark federal funds rate was accommodative, or economically stimulating, and it could remove that accommodation at a measured pace.

 When those words first appeared, the overnight rate stood at a 1958 low of 1 per cent and clearly had to move higher. With each successive step up, however, the accommodative label has become less and less appropriate.

 Calcutta/Mumbai, June 6: Bank of Baroda will re-deploy its employees once it completes the implementation of its core banking solutions (CBS). 

 The bank is in transformation mode and the implementation of core banking solutions is a step towards it. Once that is in place, the bank will have to undergo a human resource re-engineering exercise. Like the other banks who have implemented CBS, our bank will also re-deploy its employees, said S. Vaidyanathan, general manager (eastern region) of Bank of Baroda. 

 In the first phase, the bank will convert its 125 branches into core banking branches. In the next phase, another 1,000 will be connected to the CBS system. 

 Subsequently, about 1,900 branches in India and abroad will be brought under the core banking solutions network.

 It also plans to increase its ATM network to 1,000 this year, start 8 am-to- 8 pm banking in over 100 branches and round-the-clock banking in four to five locations.

 For the current fiscal, it is looking at a credit growth of 30 per cent and a 25 per cent increase in its operating profits.

 The bank has also launched its new logo as part of a brand building exercise. The new logo, which is a double B with a rising sun, is called the Baroda Sun. It symbolises the banks process of transformation towards new business paradigms. Ray amp; Keshavan, a Mumbai-based firm, has designed the logo for the bank.

 The new logo comes after the bank announced an ambitious technology enabled business transformation initiative. According to chairman Anil K Khandelwal theres more to come. He reiterated that the new corporate logo is much more than a cosmetic change and it displays the customer-centric approach of the bank. 

 The bank, he revealed, would be launching a number of customer-centric initiatives, including IT products, apart from expanding electronic delivery channels in the coming months. 

 The basic plan is to go in for a complete transformation in the banks approach and processes apart from reinforcing the focus on customer services.

 The company has signed up Rahul Dravid, vice-captain of the Indian cricket team, a multi-crore deal as brand ambassador of the bank for three years. 

 Rahul Dravids exploits in his field are legendary. He symbolises honesty and humility and brings a rare dedication and commitment to his profession. Quite aptly hes referred as Mr Dependable. 

 In many ways his personality reflects the banks approach to business ? hard work, dedication and total commitment, Khandelwal said.

 Dravid said that he was very pleased to be associated with the bank, which has given him an opportunity to showcase the banks qualities of being a reliable and consistent player over a period of time.

 BoB is also planning to expand its international businesses. It has recently received the RBIs nod for opening a full-fledged branch in Hong Kong, a representative office in Bangladesh, a branch at Leicester in the UK, a branch at Jebel Ali Free Zone in UAE and a wholly-owned subsidiary in Mauritius.

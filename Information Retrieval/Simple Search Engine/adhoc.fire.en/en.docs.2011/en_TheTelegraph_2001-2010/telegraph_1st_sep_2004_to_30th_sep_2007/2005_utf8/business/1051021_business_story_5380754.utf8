 IDBI on cover drive

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 20: IDBI Ltd, having donned the garb of a universal bank, is still keen on a presence in insurance and wants to return to mutual funds through IDBI Caps.

 An entry into insurance was being considered until a few months back and the line-up of suitors included Fortis of Belgium, AXA of France, Italys Generali and Japans Dai Ichi Bank. However, AXA, the worlds largest insurer, later joined hands with Bharti Enterprises in an alliance that would also start offering mutual fund and pension fund management at a later stage. IDBI will possibly have to look out for a third partner. 

 Reserve Bank rules cap the stake of banks in insurance ventures at 50 per cent and foreign investors at 26 per cent. 

 Taking the wraps off its second-quarter numbers, topped with a 20 per cent rise in profit at Rs 131.84 crore on an income of Rs 1,568.17 crore, IDBI said negotiations for the insurance joint venture ? sources say with three to four prospective partners ? have gone a long way.

 The asset management company will be set up by IDBI Caps. IDBI had parted ways with Principal of the US from a mutual fund venture they had set up together. The bank said it has also initiated steps to reposition its information technology subsidiary, IDBI Intech Ltd. 

 The quarterly numbers are not comparable with that of the corresponding period last year as the amalgamation of IDBI Bank with IDBI took effect from October 1, 2004. 

 For the half-year ended September 30, the net profit was Rs 240 crore while the total income was Rs 3168.85 crore. 

 For the quarter, deposits increased to Rs 18,158 crore from Rs 15,103 crore in March this year. 

 Low-cost current and savings accounts made up 36 per cent of all deposits against 31 per cent in June this year. Its capital adequacy ratio at the end of six months was 16.3 per cent, higher than the 9 per cent required by RBI. Net NPAs to net advances ratio was down to 1.24 per cent in September from 1.51 per cent at the end of June.

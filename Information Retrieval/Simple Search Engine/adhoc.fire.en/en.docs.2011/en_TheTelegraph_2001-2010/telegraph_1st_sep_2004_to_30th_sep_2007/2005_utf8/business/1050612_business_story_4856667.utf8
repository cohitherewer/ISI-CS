 London, June 11 (Reuters): The worlds richest nations agreed to cancel more than $40 billion dollars of debts owed by the worlds poorest countries to multilateral lenders, the Group of Eight (G-8) said in a statement on Saturday.

 Their final communique after a meeting of the finance ministers in London said the cost of covering debts to international lending agencies such as the World Bank, African Development Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) would be met from the existing resources. They had agreed to 100 per cent debt relief for 18 countries. British finance minister Gordon Brown said the deal would provide 100 per cent write-offs immediately for 18 countries and that more countries would qualify for relief later.

 This is the most comprehensive statement the finance ministers have ever made on debt and poverty, Brown told a news conference.

 This is not a time for timidity, this is a time for boldness, he said.

 Britain, chairing the G8 club this year, was determined to get an accord on debt at the talks in London but faced a far harder time drumming up support for a doubling of aid to Africa ahead of a meeting of G-8 leaders in Gleneagles, Scotland next month.

 The deal struck by the finance ministers from the G-8 nations is part of a British-led campaign to rid sub-Saharan Africa of poverty and diseases such as malaria and AIDS that kill millions every year. According to the most recent World Bank figures, Sub-Saharan Africas total external debt was $231 billion in 2003. Of that, 30 per cent, or $69 billion, was owed to multilateral lenders, such as the World Bank and the IMF.

 The G-8 comprises Britain, Japan, Canada, the United States, France, Italy, Germany and Russia. 

 The nations moved closer on Saturday to the historic deal to lift Africa out of poverty, but their finance ministers were still wrangling over exactly how countries should qualify for debt relief. 

 Britain, chairing the club, was determined to seal an accord on debt relief and aid for the impoverished continentbefore the G-8 leaders meet again in Gleneagles, Scotland, next month. 

 But Germany, France and Japan were still to be convinced of the merits of a proposal that would wipe out $40 billion of the debts owed by the worlds poorest nations.

 While the deal that would provide immediate debt relief for 18 countries was nearer, officials said the G-8 nations were divided on matters of principle on how to decide who should be helped. 

 Germany argued for debt relief on a case-by-case basis and said countries should show they deserved help by clamping down on corruption. Japan argued that blanket forgiveness could create a moral hazard. Officials said there was tension between France and the United States over how to offer relief on debts owed to the International Monetary Fund without weakening the lending agency. 

 Before the debt relief deal finally came through, the second of Britains ambitious proposal for Africa hardly got discussed, officials said, leaving it on the backburner until the Gleneagles summit.

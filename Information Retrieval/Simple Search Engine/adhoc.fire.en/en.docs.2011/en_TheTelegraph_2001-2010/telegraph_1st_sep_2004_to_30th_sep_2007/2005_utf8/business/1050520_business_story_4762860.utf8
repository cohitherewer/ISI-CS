 Tata Steel has a blast, net up 99%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 19: Tata Steel delivered a scorcher for 2004-05 with a 99 per cent leap in net profit at Rs 3,474.16 crore on a 33 per cent increase in turnover at Rs 15,877 crore.

 The gains came despite a furnace shutdown at the Jamshedpur plant of the company, which also had to swallow a price cut to help the government tame inflation.

 The intrinsic strength of a steel company doesnt lie in charging high prices, but in an effective strategy of cost containment and a continuous improvement in the product-mix, managing director B. Muthuraman said.

 The loss of production as a result of the 110-day halt at one of its blast furnaces was more than made up by ramping up output at the ones that were working. A price cut of Rs 2000 per tonne last August could not hurt the bottomline either as the company enriched its range of products.

 The effect of these initiatives also told on the fourth-quarter scorecard, which was topped with a 44 per cent rise in profit at Rs 908 crore against Rs 629 crore in January-March 2004.

 The only grey spot was the slimming operating margin, which fell from 42 per cent to 37 per cent. Some of those worries today weighed down the Tata Steel stock, which shed early gains to end at Rs 356.95 on Dalal Street.

 Power costs jumped 14 per cent in the past quarter, while the cost of finished and semi-finished steel increased 50 per cent. Muthuraman said the drop in March quarter margins was due to the rise in input costs and the fact that it had to source more sponge iron, a dearer input, because of the shutdown at its furnace.

 Some of those strains started easing last month, when the company decided to raise prices by 15-20 per cent. The countrys largest private steel firm dismissed talk of a price fall, saying it could fend off the possibility with long-term contracts that account for 85 per cent of its sales.

 All in a name

 The board, which announced a dividend of Rs 13 per share, also cleared the change of name to Tata Steel Limited. Muthuraman said the move was in line with the group policy and the fact that steel is its core business.

 J. J. Irani, a former managing director and a board member at Tata Sons, explained that the first word showed the group identity while the second denoted the industry it is in. Telco has been renamed Tata Motors.

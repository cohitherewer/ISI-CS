 Local arm of Thomas Cook on Dubai trip

 Going places

 Mumbai, Dec. 21: Thomas Cook AG is divesting its holding in Thomas Cook (India) to Dubai Financial, a subsidiary of Dubai Investment Group.

 The government-owned Dubai firm is picking up the promoters 60 per cent stake in Thomas Cook India and will make an open offer to acquire shares from the public.

 Senior Thomas Cook officials were not available for comments despite repeated attempts. Unconfirmed reports say that Dubai Financial will pay around $92 million for the 60 per cent stake. It is also understood that the buyer will shell out an additional $20 million for increasing its stake by another 20 per cent through the open offer. The total size of the deal is expected to be around $125 million.

 Thomas Cook AG is equally owned by Deutsche Lufthansa AG and KarstadtQuelle. It has been planning to exit the India venture as travel and travel-related services businesses have been under pressure owing to lower commission structure and reduced airfares.

 Thomas Cook India today told stock exchanges that its parent has entered into a definitive agreement to sell Thomas Cook International Markets 100 per cent equity to Dubai Financial. Thomas Cook International Markets (TCIM) holds 60 per cent in Thomas Cook India.

 Recently, Thomas Cook transferred its stake in the Indian subsidiary to the newly- floated group outfit, TCIM. Following the move, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had exempted the group from making an open offer, as it did not mean changes in the management control.

 Thomas Cook UK had proposed to transfer its 87,50,000 shares in Thomas Cook India to Thomas Cook AG, which, in turn, transferred the shares to TCIM under the plan submitted to Sebi.

 While promoters hold a 60 per cent stake in Thomas Cook India, institutional investors hold 16.67 per cent and the Indian public 19.98 per cent. The rest is with private corporate bodies, NRIs/OCBs and trusts. 

 On the BSE today, the Thomas Cook scrip ended at Rs 600.70 after opening at Rs 601 and rising to an intra-day high of Rs 605.

 Thomas Cook India has a network of 54 branches across 18 cities in the country and has two core businesses of travel-related and financial-related services. 

 The current fiscal has been challenging for the company as there was the tsunami disaster, followed by the unprecedented rains in Mumbai, Bangalore and Chennai, which, the company said, had hit the worlds sentiments towards India.

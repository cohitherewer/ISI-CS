 Insurance panel to review act

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Calcutta, March 10: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has constituted a committee to examine thoroughly and recommend on five subjects covered under the report of the Law Commission on amendments to be brought in the Insurance Act.

 ?While making this report, the Law Commission had classified the amendments under two categories ? legal and other areas. The commission has already looked into the legal aspects of the amendments and changes have been recommended. However, for the other specified areas, the commission felt that there was a need for a detailed examination by experts in the respective fields,? IRDA chairman C. S. Rao told The Telegraph.

 ?Therefore, we have constituted a committee to look into the areas of provisions relating to investments (section 27, 27A and 27B), sufficiency of assets (section 64 VA), insurance surveyors (section 64UM), tariff advisory committee (section 64UA and 64 ULA) and shareholders? and policyholders? funds (section 49),? Rao said. The committee has been asked to furnish its recommendations by April 30.

 Rao said the committee comprises people with sufficient experience in insurance and expertise in their particular areas. They will make the study and recommendations after proper consultations with interested parties like insurance companies.

 Apart from the above-mentioned fields, the committee may also indicate any other section of the Insurance Act, 1938, which needs to be amended, he added. The sections will be considered in the light of the developments that have taken place in the insurance sector other than those covered by the Law Commission?s recommendations. 

 The significance of the amendments in the Insurance Act, 1938 is considerable, keeping in view the developments that have taken place, specially passing of the IRDA Act, 1999. The Law Commission report suggests that the revision of the act be carried out in a manner that promotes insurance business and protects policyholders.

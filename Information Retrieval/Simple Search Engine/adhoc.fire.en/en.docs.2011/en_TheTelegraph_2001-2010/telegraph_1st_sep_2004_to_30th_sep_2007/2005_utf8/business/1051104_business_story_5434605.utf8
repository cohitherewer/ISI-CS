 Chiria put on SAIL cash trail

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Not a Very long way to go

 Calcutta, Nov. 3: Steel Authority of India (SAIL) plans to invest Rs 1,100 crore to develop the Chiria mines in Jharkhand.

 The company intends to step up production from Chiria to 7 million tonnes from the present level of 0.5 million tonnes.

 It will invest about Rs 400 crore on infrastructure like railway connectivity. The remaining amount will be used to develop the mines.

 Of the 2.50-billion estimated reserves in Chiria, SAIL has about 1.4 billion in its kitty. 

 The company plans to develop the mines with state-of-art technology and beneficiation facilities at Chiria involving a significant investment, a top company official said.

 It has started working on the project already with organisations like Mecon, Neeri and the Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM), who are engaged in preparing studies for the project.

 These mines are key to the proposed expansion of SAIL, which aims to step up capacity to 20 mt by 2011-12 and then 61 mt by 2029-30.

 The development comes at a time when steel majors like Tata Steel and Mittal Steel are reportedly eyeing the rich deposits ? ferrous content of 62-65 per cent ? for their proposed greenfield expansions.

 Of the 10 blocks SAIL has in its possession, the Jharkhand government had cancelled two mining leases. However, the company had contested the move and status quo is being maintained on these two blocks.

 SAIL is now pursuing the renewal of mining leases relating to Chiria and was seeking help from the central and state governments for providing required linkages of iron ore to ensure availability for meeting the companys long-term growth plan.

 The argument against SAIL was that it sat on the huge deposit and did not step up production. It was commissioned way back in 1907.

 The mines were with Indian Iron and Steel Co (IISCO), which has now been merged with SAIL. Having turned sick, IISCO could not develop these mines as it did not require those deposits.

 Given the way mining leases are distributed in India, it would be difficult to throw SAIL out from Chiria. State governments recommend the land lease to the Centre, which in turn give the mining rights to companies.

 There is no way mining lease can be taken out of central public sector unit SAIL and given to private companies. It will only ensue a long-drawn legal battle favouring none, an industry observer said.

 SAILs iron ore requirement is 21 mt, which will go up 36.5 mt by 2011-12 according to the corporate plan of the company. 

 None of the other existing mines of SAIL has half the reserves of Chiria. For instance, Rowghat in Chhattisgarh has about 464 mt ore reserves and Thakurani in Orissa has 75 mt.

 With iron ore prices shooting through the roof, raw material linkage would be crucial for the public sector company to tide over the cyclical nature of the business. Companies having own mines get more than 50 per cent price advantage over those who buy from market.

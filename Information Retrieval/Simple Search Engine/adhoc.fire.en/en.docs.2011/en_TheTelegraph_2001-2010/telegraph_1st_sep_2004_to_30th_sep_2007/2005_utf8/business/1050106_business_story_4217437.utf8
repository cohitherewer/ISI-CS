 Mumbai, Jan. 5: Bata India Ltd today announced a rights issue in the ratio of one share for every four held in a price band of Rs 45-54 apiece.

 The company will seek shareholders? permission to issue up to 12,857,000 shares of Rs 10 each for cash at a premium at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) to be held on February 2, Bata has informed the stock exchanges. At the upper end of the band, the rights issue will mobilise over Rs 69 crore.

 Bata?s price band represents a discount of over 39 per cent even at the higher-end compared with the closing price of its share on the bourses today. 

 On the BSE, after opening at Rs 95.80, the Bata scrip came down to Rs 85.50 but closed higher at Rs 88.75.

 The EGM agenda will comprise increasing the authorised capital from Rs 60 crore to Rs 70 crore.

 In June last year, Bata had said it might go in for a rights issue to mobilise funds for financial restructuring. In a board meeting last December, the directors who decided to come out with a rights issue, informed the appointment of ICICI Securities as the lead manager.

 The company, which suffered losses of Rs 24.46 crore during the quarter ended September 30 on sales of Rs 157.8 crore, has recently been focusing on retailing initiatives, which is its core competence.

 At present, while the promoters hold 51 per cent of its equity, the remaining is split among mutual funds (8.12 per cent), banks, financial institutions and insurance companies (7.23 per cent), FIIs (2.31 per cent), domestic public (26.05 per cent), private corporate bodies and NRIs/OCBs. It is expected that its Canada-based promoter will fully subscribe to the rights issue.

 The company has brought down its operating expenses following which it embarked on financial restructuring with special focus on reducing costs at the retail end. It is setting up new-look retail format stores in the country apart from investing in a point-of-sale (PoS) system to make its stores online.

 Spotlight on micro-finance

 Reddy: Searching for clue

 Hyderabad, Aug. 6: With micro-finance catching the imagination of new-economy policy makers, the Reserve Bank of India is in a dilemma over the issue of regulation of such institutions in the country.

 While emphasising the informal character of micro-finance, RBI wants to focus on the developmental aspect rather than their regulation.

 RBI governor Y. V. Reddy today said there was no need for a formal regulator for micro-finance institutions (MFIs), which were witnessing steady growth, but added such entities should be regulated at the state level. 

 ?There is no need to involve RBI either as a banking regulator or a deposit insurer,? he said while addressing a day-long conference on micro-finance here today.

 He said non-credit services provided by MFIs had helped in anti-poverty initiatives.

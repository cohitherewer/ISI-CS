 Bechtel fires Dabhol dues salvo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 1: Armed with a US federal court ruling, Bechtel Corporation has attached the shares of Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) in Dabhol Power Company. The new twist to the Dabhol tangle comes at a time when General Electric is making conciliatory noises about working with Indian firms ready to restart the stalled project.

 Bechtel took action when Dabhol Power Company failed to meet the May 27 deadline set by an international arbitration panel last month to pay $123 million for violation of its shareholder rights in the power venture. 

 The order, delivered by the US district Judge Lewis Kaplan in the southern district of New York, said the assets held by Maharashtra Power Development Corporation, which owns 14.6 per cent of Dabhol Power, should be attached.

 The Maharashtra governments plan to acknowledge the order sends a message to other foreign investors whose capital and technical expertise is needed in a big way to help modernise Indias infrastructure. Bechtel, however, continues to maintain that it supports companies that are trying to revive the jinxed power plant.

 Nevertheless, we stand ready to help restart the much-needed Dabhol facility, once India upholds our legal rights and abides by its international obligations, Bechtel executive vice-president and director Tim Statton said. 

 US conglomerate General Electric, which, along with Bechtel, holds 85 per cent in DPC, has announced all help to National Thermal Power Corp and Bhel to get the 2,184-MW project, defunct for past five years, going again.

 The US court order follows a decision on April 27 by the Paris-based International Court of Arbitration holding MSEB and the state government responsible for blocking Dabhol Power from exercising its contractual rights to arbitrate claims against Maharashtra and the central government for the expropriation of the investment. 

 We are disappointed that Indian authorities have given us no choice but to begin proceedings to seize assets, Statton added. 

 Bechtel affiliates in Mauritius and the Netherlands have filed two additional arbitration claims against the government to recover the value of their lost Dabhol investments, which could add up to more than $6 billion.

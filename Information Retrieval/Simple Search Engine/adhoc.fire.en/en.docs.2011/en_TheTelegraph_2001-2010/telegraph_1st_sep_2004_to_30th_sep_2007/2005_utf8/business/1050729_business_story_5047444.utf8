 Calcutta, July 28: The shareholders of Rossell Tea Limited have approved the amendment to the company?s memorandum of association, allowing it to make a foray in the hotel and aviation businesses.

 The company is finalising a deal with an established aviation company and is expected to make an announcement in the next three months.

 ?We will set up an aviation support facility, now that the sector is witnessing a boom,? Rossell Tea executive chairman H. M. Gupta said on the sidelines of the company?s annual general meeting.

 ?The profits in the tea business have dwindled over the last few years. Therefore, we intend to diversify into the aviation business to enhance the company?s profitability,? said Gupta.

 It is also looking at the possibility of manufacturing, buying and selling aircraft, avionics and electronic components. The company is also considering import, export, and distribution of motor vehicle spare parts and accessories.

 ?Our focus is on manufacturing quality tea and we intend to convert all our gardens into the orthodox variety. We have recently converted one of our gardens. Last year, we manufactured two million tonnes of orthodox tea, which is expected to increase by 25 per cent this year,? said Gupta.

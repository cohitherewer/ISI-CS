 Tata Motors declares day off

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Jamshedpur, Sept. 30: It was supposed to be a tool-down strike today at Tata Motors. But when the employees of the morning shift reached the factory at 6 am, they were turned away by security guards, who were deployed in large numbers outside the main gates.

 At the gate, a notice announced that today was a holiday.

 The notice issued by company president A.P. Arya urged the employees to exercise restraint and have faith on dialogue with the management. The employees were also requested to maintain normal production, peace, harmony and complete discipline in the plant till the bonus issue was resolved. The Intuc-affiliated Telco Workers Union had announced a tool-down strike today in protest against the alleged indifference of the management to pay the annual bonus according to the unions demands. The union wanted the ceiling on the bonus to be lifted. The sudden change in tack came late last evening, when Union general secretary Gopeshwar met the company president over the bonus issue. 

 According to Gopeshwar, the management has assured him that the issue will be discussed and a mutually acceptable solution will be worked out at the earliest. There was, however, no breakthrough.

 Late in the night, the management decided to declare September 30 as the weekly off. This way, sources explained, the company would not lose out on an extra off day, which it had to give because Gandhi Jayanti had fallen on a Sunday. By declaring Friday as the weekly off, it had saved a day and also stopped the union from going on strike, they added. The weekly off was also imposed for the employees of HVAL and HVTL, both subsidiaries of Tata Motors.

 Union sources informed that such a strike had taken place after 35 years. The strike completely paralysed production activities in the Jamshedpur unit, which manufactures about 210 commercial vehicles per day.

 According to union functionaries, Tata Motors continued to follow the archaic Bonus Act that doles out 8.33 per cent bonus on the basic and dearness allowance of employees plus the ex-gratia, irrespective of the profits made.

 The union wants the company to fix a percentage of the profits as bonus for its employees, they said.

 Gopeshwar had made the announcement of the strike at a mass meeting of the company workers on the union office premises yesterday.

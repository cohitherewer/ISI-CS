 Bharti rings in set-top boxes

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ludhiana, Sept. 25: Bharti Teletech has entered the direct-to-home (DTH) segment by launching digital set-top boxes in the organised retail sector.

 DTH satellite television transmits programmes directly at homes without the help of the local cable operator.

 Customers need to use small receive-only (digital signals) dish antennas of 45 cm to 60 cm diameter installed at convenient location in individual buildings without needing to elaborate foundation or space. A digital receiver is also needed to receive the multiplexed signals and view them on a TV. DTH, in sharp contrast to cable TV, lends itself to easy monitoring and control.

 Bharti Teletech vice-chairman and managing director Rakesh Bharti Mittal said, The launch of the DTH set-top box is in keeping with the companys strategy to diversify into new areas, which offer huge potential for growth.

 Out of more than one billion people in the country, about 100 million homes have televisions. This market is growing at around 10-12 per cent per year. Of these 100 million TV homes, cable systems provide entertainment to around 50 per cent.

 The remaining 50 per cent of households rely on the traditional antenna-based system through which they can view limited channels.

 It is this segment, which is predominantly present in the upcountry and rural areas that is being targeted by us. To begin with, we plan to sell half-a-million set-top boxes by the end of the next financial year, said Mittal.

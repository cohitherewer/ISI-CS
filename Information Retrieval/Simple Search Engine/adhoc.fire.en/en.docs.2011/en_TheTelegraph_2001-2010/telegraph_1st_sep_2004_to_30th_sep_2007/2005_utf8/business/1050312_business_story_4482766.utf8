 Calcutta, March 11: Birla Sun Life Insurance expects to close the current fiscal with a first-year premium income of Rs 800 crore, an increase of around 73 per cent from last year?s Rs 462 crore.

 For the first 10 months ended January 31, the second largest private life insurer has collected new business premium of Rs 426.1 crore, an increase of 113 per cent over the corresponding period last year. The premium revenue for the period was Rs 587.3 crore, registering a growth of 145 per cent. 

 Chief executive officer Nani B. Javeri said, ?We have pioneered the unit-linked insurance plans and have only such products in our portfolio. Our growth has been backed by such plans.?

 The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has announced that it is going to formulate certain guidelines to change the structure of the unit-linked plans. Also, the authority is going to formulate guidelines to curb misuse of such plans.

 According to Javeri, these changes will not much affect the product structure of the insurer. ?Such rules should affect those products, which are structured to cater to short-term requirements as the authority wants to distinguish between long-term protection-cum-investment plans and short-term investment plans. However, our products are not likely to require probable changes such as a minimum premium to sum assured ratio,? he added.

 The company judges the market potential value (MPV) of cities based on the prosperity, consumption pattern, awareness levels, market support and the size of the market. 

 On the basis of that index, Calcutta ranks third next to Mumbai and Delhi.

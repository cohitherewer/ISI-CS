 Upgrade call for 20 NTC mills

 New Delhi, May 15 (PTI): The government has decided to modernise 20 of the 53 National Textile Corporation (NTC) mills that are still working. 

 The group of ministers (GoM) for the revival of working NTC mills has given its go ahead to the modernisation of 15 best performing mills at the cost Rs 359.40 crore. Apart from the 15 mills, which have already been identified, the GoM has authorised textile ministry to select any five mills for revival. 

 The funds for modernisation would come from the sale of land and other assets to the 69 NTC mills that have already been closed.

 The process of sale of land of NTC mills had come to a standstill following a Mumbai high court order. But gathered steam later after the Supreme Courts judgment.

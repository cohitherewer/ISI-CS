 Leading Hotels decks up for 2007 drive

 GARIMA SINGH

 New Delhi, April 18: The Leading Hotels of the World (LHW) ? a top hotel accreditation outfit ? is drawing up plans for a major thrust in India in two years.

 ?We will focus on India in the next 24 months, depending on how the club membership develops,? said Welf J. Ebeling, executive vice-president and chief operating officer of LHW. 

 Headquartered in New York, LHW represents more than 420 of the world?s finest hotels, resorts and spas across more than 80 locations. More than 13 hotels in India are members of this premier organisation. These include properties of the Taj and the Oberoi group of hotels.

 LHW is breaking with tradition and is, for the first time, picking up stakes in vacation home projects in Europe and North America.

 ?We are in the process of buying large two -or three-room suites and service apartments that are strategically placed. These could be within a hotel or in its vicinity. We are looking for four such properties in North America and one in Europe,? said Ebeling. 

 The group will invest nearly $3 million in each property.

 Capitalising on the strength of the ?Leading? brand, the company introduced its first brand extension ?The Leading Small Hotels of the World ? in 1999.

 It also established several joint-venture companies like Leading Group Sales, Leading Quality Assurance, Leading Financial Services, Leading Interactive Reservations, The Leading Hotel Schools of the World, Leading Service Provider Network, The Leading Trust, Leading By Design and Leading Insurance Services. 

 Earlier this year, the company launched Leading Spas of the World, the first global evaluation and certification programme for the spa industry.

 ?We established the Leading Spas inspection and certification programme to assure our guests that they could depend on the same levels of quality and service at a Leading Spa that they have come to expect at a Leading Hotel, quot; Ebeling had said earlier.

 Hotels seeking membership of LHW or The Leading Small Hotels of the World are required to apply for admission.

 In order to become a member of LHW, the property must meet all of the company?s exacting global luxury standards with respect to accommodations, service, cuisine and features. 

 The membership is given for a period of three years and involves a one-time as well as an annual fee.

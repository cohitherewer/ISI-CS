 IFC tonic for Dabur Pharma

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, May 4: International Finance Corporation (IFC) will invest $15 million (Rs 67.5 crore) in Dabur Pharma (DPL) to fund the Indian company?s expansion plan.

 The money will flow into Dabur, which specialises in oncology, by way of a preferential allotment. At a meeting last week, Dabur Pharma board has approved the proposal to offer IFC preferential equity at Rs 54 a share with a face value Re 1.

 When contacted, Dabur official confirmed the development. ?We have decided to allot 1.22 crore shares to IFC. Post issue, IFC?s shareholding in the company will be 7.8 per cent of the extended equity,? the official said.

 The IFC board, however, is yet to approve the transaction. 

 The Dabur share closed at Rs 50.85, up Rs 1.70 or 3.46 per cent, at the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

 The preferential issue to IFC is the first tranche of Dabur Pharma?s fund raising exercise.

 The company has earmarked $70 million or Rs 300 crore investment in the next few years to expand its existing production capacity as well as set up a new plant in Himachal Pradesh.

 The IFC money will be mainly utilised for expansion of its bulk drug manufacturing facilities at Kalyani near Calcutta and at Baddi in Himachal Pradesh.

 The company is considering another round of equity dilution post-IFC allotment. When asked, the official said Dabur is exploring three options. ?It could be debt, internal accruals or a fresh preferential allotment,? the official said.

 DPL is a market leader in oncology (cancer treatment) formulations and active pharmaceuticals ingredients (API or bulk drugs) in the country and exports to over 30 markets across the world.

 Yes Bank to raise Rs 300 cr

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 23: Yes Bank is all set to hit the markets with its maiden issue to raise Rs 300 crore over the next three months.

 ?We will come up with an IPO within 90 days. The bank will file the red herring prospectus with Sebi in March-April,? said Rana Kapoor, managing director and CEO of Yes Bank after signing a bancassurance tieup with Max NewYork Life Insurance company.

 Refusing to divulge the price of the issue, he said the flotation would use the bookbuilding route.

 The paid-up capital of the bank would go up from Rs 200 crore to Rs 500 crore after the public issue. The public shareholding will rise to 25 per cent.

 After the public offer, the foreign holding in the bank is also expected to come down to 34 to 35 per cent from the present 45 per cent. 

 At present, Rabobank of the Netherlands holds a 20 per cent stake in Yes Bank, while three private equity investors ? CVC International, ChrysCapital and AIF Capital ? have a 25 per cent stake in the new generation private bank.

 Yes Bank was promoted by Rana Kapoor and Ashok Kapur who together hold 52.5 per cent and the bank employees have the remaining 2.5 per cent. After getting a banking licence from the Reserve Bank of India in May 2004, Yes Bank has been able to mop up Rs 600 crore in deposits and disburse Rs 750 crore in loans.

 The bank now has a capital adequacy ratio of more than 20 per cent against the regulatory norm of 9 per cent.

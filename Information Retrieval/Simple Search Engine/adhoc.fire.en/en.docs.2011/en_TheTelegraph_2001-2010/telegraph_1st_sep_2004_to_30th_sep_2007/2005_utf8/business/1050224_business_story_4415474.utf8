The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 IIBI to start merger talks with IDBI soon

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Singh: Ready to talk

 Calcutta, Feb. 23: Industrial Investment Bank of India (IIBI) will start merger talks with Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) soon. 

 The relaxation in takeover norms for public sector banks, announced by finance minister P. Chidambaram on February 22 has encouraged the bank. 

 Talking to The Telegraph, IIBI chairman . N. Singh said, ?We will start talks on the proposed merger once the Union Budget 2005-06 is tabled.?

 The finance minister has said PSU banks can acquire any company ? whether it is a private bank, non-banking finance company, housing finance firm ? or any other business to increase its balancesheet size and enter sectors that have potential.

 IDBI has already received a banking licence and once the merger with IDBI is completed by March-end, it will start functioning as a full-fledged bank.

 After that, it will be easier for IDBI to merge IIBI with itself. IDBI had earlier carried out a due diligence of the city-based development financial institution.

 In Budget 2004-05, Chidambaram had announced an interest subsidy of Rs 143 crore for IIBI. The funds were for cleaning up the books before IIBI merged with IDBI.

 Sources said IIBI did not receive the entire Rs 143 crore from the finance ministry.

 Incidentally, the finance ministry had earlier approved the conversion of 20-year loans of IDBI and IIBI from International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and National Industrial Credit (long-term operations) into 50-year loans. 

 Singh said he has not heard anything from the finance ministry for the last few months. ?IIBI is surviving on recovery of old dues and treasury operations,? said Singh.

 Singh, who is also the chairman and managing director of Allahabad Bank, said they are open to acquisitions too. 

 ?We cannot talk about our merger plans as we have filed our draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India for a second public issue,? Singh said.

 Allahabad Bank is keen to acquire a mid-sized south India-based bank and Singh is happy with the easy takeover norms for the banking sector.

 ?This will help in consolidation of the sector,? he added.

 AllBank deposits 

 Crisil has assigned P1+ rating to the certificate of deposit programme of AllBank. The bank proposes to raise Rs 1 crore through this programme.

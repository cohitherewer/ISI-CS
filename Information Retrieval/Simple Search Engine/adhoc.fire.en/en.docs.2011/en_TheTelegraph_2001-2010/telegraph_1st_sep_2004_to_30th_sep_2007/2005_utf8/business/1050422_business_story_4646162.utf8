 Digital dream mutes decibel dominance 

 on NYSE 

 JENNY ANDERSON 

 It?s a big buy 

 New York, April 21: The 

 New York Stock Exchange, whose shouting traders and frenzied 

 activity have become a global symbol of capitalism, announced 

 on Wednesday that it would acquire a leading electronic 

 trading system. The deal allows the exchange to become a 

 public company but casts doubts on its 213-year-old system 

 of auction trading. 

 The exchange will merge its operations 

 with Archipelago, one of the biggest electronic trading 

 operators, to form the NYSE Group. 

 The deal will give the exchange?s 

 1,366 seat holders $400 million in cash and 70 per cent 

 of shares of the combined, publicly traded company. More 

 important, it will enable the exchange to expand its ability 

 to handle trade electronically, staving off challenges from 

 its traditional rival Nasdaq and more global competitors 

 like Euronext and Deutsche Boerse. 

 ?This transaction, transforming 

 the New York Stock Exchange into a public, for-profit entity, 

 is an essential step to maintain our global competitiveness 

 and leadership,? said John Thain, the chief executive of 

 the exchange, who will run the new entity. ?We believe that 

 our new combined company will be a world-class competitor 

 in every respect.? 

 The merger is the most significant 

 acknowledgement yet that the Big Board?s traditional market 

 driven by human traders may not be able to survive in an 

 era increasingly dominated by instantaneous electronic trades. 

 On the storied floor of the New 

 York Stock Exchange, hundreds of men and women in blue and 

 green jackets spend their days monitoring screens, handling 

 multiple calls and yelling at each other in an effort to 

 get the best price for buyers and sellers of stock. 

 Defenders of the system say their 

 human judgement is critical; critics say the system is overrun 

 with conflicts and rife with a history of misdeeds. After 

 a three-year investigation, seven firms on the floor paid 

 more than $240 million in fines for trading violations. 

 Last week, 15 traders were indicted on related charges. 

 Electronic exchanges, on the other hand, simply match the 

 trade anonymously. 

 The deal answers the calls of 

 members, investors and indirectly, regulators, who have 

 demanded that the New York Stock Exchange ? the last major 

 exchange in the world to have floor-based trading ? become 

 faster and more electronic, more diversified and public. 

 Thain hopes to create an exchange that can use its stock 

 to do deals and offer trading in different financial instruments 

 to attract big investors. While small, individual investors 

 are generally unaware of how or where their stocks are traded, 

 the big institutions that manage trillions of dollars through 

 mutual funds and pension funds have long complained that 

 New York was too slow and too conflicted. 

 ?We will offer our customers choice,? 

 said Thain. The choice will be to trade NYSE listed stocks, 

 which the exchange trades today, as well as Nasdaq stocks, 

 bonds and derivatives. 

 By being a public entity, Thain 

 escapes the exchange?s long infighting among customers, 

 seat owners and members of the exchange. By converting to 

 for-profit status, the NYSE Group will have to answer only 

 to its shareholders. The deal is ?a home run,? said Frank 

 Christensen, a 40-year member who is a principal at Kelly 

 Christensen, a trading firm that operates on the floor. 

 ?It brings the connectivity we need to maintain our position 

 globally. It will heat the competition between Nasdaq and 

 New York, and that?s in the public interest.?

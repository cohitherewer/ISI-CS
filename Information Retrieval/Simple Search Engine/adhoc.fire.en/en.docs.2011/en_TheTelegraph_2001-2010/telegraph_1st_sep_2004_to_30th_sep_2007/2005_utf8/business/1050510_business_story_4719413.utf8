 Syndicate Bank earnings dip 7%

 May 9 (PTI): Syndicate Banks net profit dipped by 7.19 per cent to Rs 402.90 crore last fiscal from Rs 434.13 crore in the previous year. Total income increased to Rs 4,322.18 crore compared with Rs 3,861.25 crore.

 CMD N Kantha Kumar said the decline was due to a Rs 382-crore provision made on government securities transferred to hold-to-maturity category and Rs 92 crore towards wage revision.

 Operating profit declined 5.69 per cent to Rs 994 crore (Rs 1,054 crore). Despite the decline in net and operating profits, the bank has proposed a final dividend of 14 per cent for 2004-05. With an interim dividend of 6 per cent, the total payout is 20 per cent.

 He admitted that the deposit growth had only been 8.58 per cent and mobilisation at Rs 43,706 crore against Rs 40,252 crore in 2003-04.

 The banks NPA management has been ?good?, he said, adding that the net NPA ratio has come down to 1.59 per cent from 2.58 per cent at the end of March 2004. Gross NPA has declined to 5.17 per cent from 7.33 per cent.

 The bank is charting a strategy to increase its portfolio under SMEs, mid-size firms, SSIs, retail business and consumer credit, Kumar said. ?Under resource mobilisation, the banks focus is to shed high-cost bulk deposits and rely more on low-cost deposits,? he added.

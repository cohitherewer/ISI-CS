 Ranchi, Aug. 20: Tata Steel today signed an agreement with the Jharkhand government, renewing the Jamshedpur land lease for 30 years.

 Tata Steel chairman Ratan Tata described the renewal as re-establishment of the 100-year partnership with Jharkhand and promised to re-examine Tata Steels investments in the state. 

 Holding a joint news conference with Jharkhand chief minister Arjun Munda after the steel giant signed three agreements with the government this noon, Tata said it was a momentous day since the uncertainties of the lease renewal had been left behind. 

 He hoped the partnership with Jharkhand would continue for another 100 years or more. Tata also promised to establish the presence of the fast-growing Tata Consultancy Services to give a fillip to infotech in the state. 

 The three MoUs were signed by Jharkhand chief secretary P.P. Sharma and Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman. While one is for the renewal of land lease, another was for a special medical insurance scheme for poor people wherein the company will contribute Rs 25 crore for 30 years. The third MoU was for the construction of a Rs 300-crore sports complex in Ranchi. The Tatas will bear half of the costs.

 Tata, who earlier presented a cheque of Rs 150 crore to the government for the sports complex, said: Investments in itself bring money to the state. I think what we would like to do is to work with the government to improve skills and create a vast number of jobs to raise the prosperity level of the people of Jharkhand. He emphasised it was his companys responsibility to improve the quality of life of the people of the state. 

 Reiterating his companys social commitment, Tata said launching the medical insurance scheme for people living below the poverty line is a small indication of our genuine desire to improve the quality of life in the state.

 Munda admitted there was some delay in renewing the land lease but hoped the agreement will herald a new era and the Tatas will bring in the much-needed industrial revolution in the state.

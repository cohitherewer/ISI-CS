The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Q amp;A

 Bitter bonus

 I had invested Rs 75,000 in UTI Retirement Benefit Plan (Pension Fund), which allotted bonus units at a later date. Shall those units be taken as reinvestment in the scheme and the benefit of income tax rebate claimed before changes in this regard are brought into effect from the next year?

 Anil Mukherjee, Calcutta

 No, the bonus units shall not be taken as reinvestment in the fund. You will be eligible for tax benefit for any additional amount you invest in the fund.

 Locational advantage

 We receive an allowance of Rs 1500 per month for being posted in the northeast. Is this amount taxable?

 Tapas Deb, Dibrugarh

 According to government guidelines, a special duty allowance is paid to employees who have been posted to the northeast states from outside and such an amount is exempted from tax. 

 Late payment

 The pay scale of our company was revised on January 1, 1997. However, due to financial constraints, the company was unable to pay higher salaries so long and had agreed to pay interest on the arrears at EPF rate. The first arrear salary with interest was released in February. Shall I get tax benefit for the interest amount under section 80L?

 Mihir Dasgupta, by e-mail

 No, both the arrear salary and the interest thereon shall be added to your income from salary. No deduction is allowed under section 80L for the interest amount. Section 80L is for deduction on interest received from investments in eligible securities.

 EPF money

 I had left a company 18 months back after working for almost two years but did not get my EPF transferred to the new company. If I now withdraw my accumulated amount, shall I have to pay income tax?

 Aneek Banerjee, by e-mail

 No, your withdrawal shall not be subject to income tax since all investment, accumulation and withdrawal from EPF is exempt from tax.

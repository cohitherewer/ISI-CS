 Maruti about-turn with Versa recall

 BACK TO BASICS

 New Delhi, Dec. 6: Maruti Udyog Ltd, the country?s largest carmaker, today recalled over 2,000 Versa vans for replacing a faulty component in their exhaust systems.

 ?During the post-production internal quality audit carried by the company recently, it was found that there were certain aberrations in one component of the exhaust system of Versa (BS-III),? a company spokesperson told The Telegraph.

 ?Although the problem was discovered in a small number of vehicles, we have requested all Versa customers whose chasis numbers are in the range of 112275 to 114492 to get their vehicles checked at any of our authorised dealer workshops,? he said. 

 The faulty component will be replaced immediately, free of cost, the spokesperson added. 

 Maruti, however, clarified there was ?no major functional problem? in the cars and the recall has been done ?as a precautionary measure, since we are a customer-friendly company?. 

 Versa, positioned in the C segment, is one of the few Maruti vehicles which does not have a large market. Between April and November this year, only 2,046 such cars were sold.

 By contrast, Omni, positioned in the same segment, totted up sales of 41,000 units during the same period. One of the reasons for this lies in prices. Omni costs around Rs 2.3 lakh, while Versa is priced between Rs 4.2 and Rs 4.6 lakh. 

 Officials said it is not the first time that such a technical snag has been detected in Maruti?s vehicles. ?In the beginning of this year, we recalled a few Zen cars as well,? confirmed the spokesperson. He did not divulge the exact number of cars that were recalled.

 Versa is available in three petrol variants ? deluxe, Dx2 and super deluxe. To boost its sales, the company has repositioned the van as ?the family car?. It was earlier being sold as a model which had ?two luxury cars in one?. 

 Versa, launched in October 2001, was gifted to super star Amitabh Bachchan on his 60th birthday. Maruti had made the Bollywood icon and his son Abhishek the model?s brand ambassadors for two years. But the superstar?s image and the heavy ad spend failed to push up sales. A Maruti official conceded there was only a ?moderate increase in sales?. 

 The contract with the Bachchans was not renewed and the expensive ad campaign was scaled down. Versa has no brand ambassadors now. 

 At its launch, Maruti chief Jagdish Khattar said the company had invested Rs 300-400 crore on launching Versa, built on an entirely new platform.

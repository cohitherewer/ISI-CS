 Mitsubishi to widen alliance with HM

 Tokyo, May 30 (Bloomberg): Mitsubishi Motors Corp, Japans only unprofitable automaker, said it would expand its alliance with Hindustan Motors in a bid to boost sales and reduce costs.

 Mitsubishi Motors may buy auto parts from its Indian alliance, the Tokyo-based company said in a faxed release. 

 Hindustan Motors, which now sells the Mitsubishis Lancer sedans and Pajero sports-utility vehicles, will build a new model in India starting in January 2006, the Japanese automaker said.

 Mitsubishi Motors has received two bailouts from shareholders in the past 12 months. It sold 1.37 million vehicles in the year ended March 31.

 The Calcutta-based Hindustan Motors, which makes the Ambassador car in India for over 50 years, will also import more Mitsubishi models such as the Grandis minivan. The Indian automaker also makes engines for General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor.

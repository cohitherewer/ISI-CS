 Bank of Baroda in makeover mode

 Khandelwal: Quality check

 Mumbai, April 17: Bank of Baroda (BoB) is conducting a comprehensive exercise internally to create a sales culture and align its employees to such a change in an attempt to transform itself into a leading bank.

 Besides looking at changing its logo, the bank is now engaged in drafting a vision document. It also plans to utilise the autonomy recently granted by the ministry of finance regarding HR issues and merge unviable branches.

 Senior BoB officials said the bank is now planning to recruit the best talent available in various areas, including risk management, thus placing the bank on a par with its private sector and foreign counterparts. 

 It is also weighing the options of merging some unviable branches. ?We will not close them though. The personnel of these branches will be suitably redeployed,? an official said.

 Sources said these changes will be carried out over the next one year to make BoB a world-class bank. ?Merely implementing technology is not enough. Banks need to take other initiatives too to make this technology effective,? sources said.

 According to chairman and managing director A. K. Khandelwal, while the bank is now involved in creating a sales culture, it plans to align its employees to the new mind-set. He said this will be done through training programmes that will coach them on using new delivery channels and servicing the customer. 

 BoB is also looking at drafting the services of international agencies to create the sales culture. Khandelwal said at the executive level too, the bank is engaged in bringing about a digital change.

 On Friday, BoB had announced a technology-enabled business transformation project that includes core banking for 1919 domestic branches and 55 others spread in 20 countries.

 Under the programme, HP will implement and manage the architecture, including core banking, phone banking, Internet banking, delivery channel integration, risk and performance management, customer relationship management, data warehousing, global treasury, human resources management system (HRMS) and cheque truncation system. 

 The project is expected to benefit the bank in many ways. While BoB will be Basel II-complaint through implementation of risk management, it can also get a complete view of its customers through implementation of the core banking solution and customer relationship management.

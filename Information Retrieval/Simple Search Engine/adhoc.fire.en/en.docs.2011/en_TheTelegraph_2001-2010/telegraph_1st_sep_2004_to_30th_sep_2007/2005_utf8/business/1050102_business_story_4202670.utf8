The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Dollar continues to rule weak

 New York, Jan. 1 (Reuters): The dollar eked out some gains against the euro on Friday, the last trading day of 2004, but the beleaguered US currency ended the year at a nine-year low against a basket of major currencies.

 The yen also gained across the board on growing sentiment that Asian currencies will make big strides against the dollar in 2005.

 The brunt of the dollar?s decline in the past few years has been mainly against the euro, as investors fret about the growing size of the US trade deficit. But analysts expect Asian currencies to take on their share of the falling dollar in 2005.

 ?The issues today have centered on burden sharing in the currency market and when China may revalue (the yuan) between now and various Chinese holidays including the Chinese New Year (on Feb 9),? said John Rothfield, currency strategist with Bank of America in San Francisco.

 Many foreign exchange desks cleared out early as traders left to ring in the new year, but thin volume emboldened some to lock in profits.

 The euros rise to 141.61 yen on Thursday prompted a wave of overnight profit-taking in Asia and London, triggering a parallel slide in the dollar against the yen.

 ?Euro/yen has been the main driver of the Japanese currency this week,? said Alex Beuzelin, senior strategist at Ruesch International in Washington. quot;I wouldnt read too much into the moves today, quot; he added.

 By early afternoon, the yen rebounded broadly, with the euro falling over 1 percent to 138.80 yen and the dollar sliding 0.5 percent to 102.54 yen.

 The dollar recovered against the Swiss currency, rising over 1 percent to a session high of 1.1438 francs.

 The dollar had hit a new 9-year low Thursday of 1.1281 francs.

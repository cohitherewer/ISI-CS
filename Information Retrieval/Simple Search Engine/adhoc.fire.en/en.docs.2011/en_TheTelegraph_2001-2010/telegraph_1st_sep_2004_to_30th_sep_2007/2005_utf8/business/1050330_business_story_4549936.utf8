 Consumers in Bengal to feel power pinch

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Costly proposition

 Calcutta, March 29: Power consumers ? both domestic and industrial ? in Bengal may have to shell out more from next month with the West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) seeking a revision in tariff.

 The state power board?s petition comes in the wake of West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission?s (WBERC) decision to jack up the rates at which West Bengal Power Development Corporation sells energy to the board. The regulatory commission has decided to raise the rate by 8 paise on an average.

 The rate at which Durgapur Projects Limited (DPL) supplies power to the power board has also been jacked up on an average by 21.65 paise per unit. 

 WBSEB has filed a petition to increase the average tariff by 12 paise from Rs 3.20 to Rs 3.32.

 The state electricity regulator today announced the tariff of three power utilities ? WBPDCL, DPL and DPSCL (Dishergarh Power Supply) for the year 2005-06.

 Power generated by WBPDCL at its Bakreswar and Bandel units have become dearer due to various factors. The average supply cost from the Bakreswar unit has increased to Rs 1.89 per unit from Rs 1.65 per unit ? a rise of 24 paise per unit.

 While the supply cost from Bandel has increased to Rs 1.89 per unit from Rs 1.71 per unit,. The cost at Santaldih has seen a marginal rise to Rs 1.87 from Rs 1.86. Only power generated at Kolaghat has become cheaper by 10 paise, down to Rs 1.72 per unit from Rs 1.82 per unit.

 The new supply rates will be applicable from April 1. The fuel cost of each power station will be adjusted periodically according to a specific formula.

 It is not yet clear whether this rise in cost of supply of power from WBPDCL to WBSEB will have an impact on CESC?s tariff. CESC, as a licensee buys 850 million units of power from WBSEB at a flat rate of Rs 2.69 per unit.

 WBERC has also asked WBPDCL to give its opinion on the introduction of differential rates of fixed charges for peak and off-peak hours for better management of load. WBPDCL will have to submit the report by June.

 The cost of power supply from DPL to WBSEB for 132 KV consumers has increased to Rs 2.06 from Rs 1.85 per unit, for 33 KV consumers it has increased to Rs 2.06 from Rs 1.90 per unit and for 11 KV consumers from Rs 1.95 per unit to Rs 2.21 per unit.

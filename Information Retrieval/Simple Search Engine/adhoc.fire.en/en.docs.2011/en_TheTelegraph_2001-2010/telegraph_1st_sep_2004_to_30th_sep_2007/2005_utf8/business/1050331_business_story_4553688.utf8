 MCI embraces new Verizon offer

 Many Takers

 Washington, March 30 (Reuters): MCI Inc accepted a sweetened takeover offer of $7.6 billion from Verizon Communications Inc on Tuesday, citing Verizon?s scale and growth prospects in rejecting Qwest Communications International Inc?s $8.45-billion bid.

 Shares of MCI rose 4 per cent, and traded higher than Verizon?s offer price as investors speculated on the likelihood of a hostile bid from Qwest.

 Qwest said it would ?assess the situation? but still believed its bid was superior. A source familiar with the situation said Qwest?s board would meet on Wednesday to consider raising its bid.

 If Qwest persists in its battle, it could bypass MCI?s management and take its offer directly to the company?s shareholders. But MCI has a defence mechanism against unwanted takeovers, making it costly for anyone to buy 15 per cent or more of its stock.

 Many MCI shareholders have urged Qwest to pursue MCI, saying Verizon?s original $6.75-billion offer was too low. Verizon said its revised bid was a ?compelling? offer for MCI shareholders.

 Verizon?s revised bid is ?a step in the right direction. It?s not over,? said Bruce Berkowitz, whose Fairholme Fund owns 11 million MCI shares, ahead of MCI?s official announcement.

 ?Qwest still has a superior offer. Qwest?s synergies are real. MCI is hugely valuable to both Qwest and Verizon. The highest bid should win,? Berkowitz said.

 Lamy takes lead in race for WTO post

 Lamy: Happy tidings

 Geneva, April 16 (Reuters): Former European Union trade chief Pascal Lamy took the lead on Friday in the race to head the World Trade Organisation (WTO) after a first round of consultations that saw the Brazilian contender knocked out. 

 The chairman of the selection panel, Kenyan ambassador Amina Mohamed, said Lamy had more support than Mauritian trade minister Jaya Krishna Cuttaree and Carlos Perez del Castillo, former Uruguayan trade envoy to the WTO. 

 Brazil?s candidate, its WTO envoy Luiz Felipe Seixas Correa, backed by India and China, should withdraw under the 148-member body?s selection rules in which the candidate with least support is eliminated in successive rounds of consultations. 

 ?Lamy had the highest level of preferences and the most broad support,? Mohamed told reporters. ?The candidate least likely to attract consensus was the candidate from Brazil.? 

 Although Brazil said it wanted more time to consider its response, Mohamed said the next round of consultations would begin on April 25, with only the three other candidates. 

 The WTO, which sets the rules for world trade, aims to find a successor to current director-general Supachai Panitchpakdi by the end of May. 

 After the rows surrounding the last election, when New Zealand?s Mike Moore and Supachai ended up serving three years each, the WTO is desperate for a peaceful transition. 

 Members fear a fresh fight over the leadership could delay the WTO round of free trade negotiations, with trade ministers due to conclude key pacts in Hong Kong in December. 

 The head of the WTO, who usually serves four years, can have much personal influence, but, unlike the chiefs of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or World Bank, has no decision-taking powers.

 IDBI merger swap ratio at 1:1.42

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 All about numbers 

 Mumbai, Jan. 20: A swap ratio of 100 shares of IDBI Ltd for 142 of IDBI Bank has been fixed by the boards of the two merging entities.

 IDBI will transfer 2.5 per cent of the share capital to a trust and extinguish the balance shares held by it in IDBI Bank for the benefit of the merged entity. This has been done so that the government?s shareholding in IDBI is 51.4 per cent after the merger.

 IDBI?s step to form a trust that will house a 2.5 per cent stake is being seen as a shareholder-friendly move. The ICICI group had taken a similar step during the reverse merger of ICICI Ltd with ICICI Bank. The Reliance group also adopted the same measure during the merger of Reliance Petroleum Ltd with Reliance Industries Ltd. 

 ICICI Bank had subsequently sold the shares parked in the special purpose vehicle (SPV) to foreign investors for around Rs 1300 crore. Though IDBI officials were not available to comment on any lock-in period for the shares in the SPV, it is believed that the entity could adopt a similar move as ICICI Bank to meet its requirements.

 Observers said the swap ratio is fair to IDBI Bank shareholders. A 1:2.25 ratio was expected, which would have been against shareholders of the private bank.

 The swap ratio is based on the valuation of IDBI shares carried out by BSR amp; Co ? chartered accountants engaged by IDBI Bank ? and that of IDBI Bank by Khimji Kunvarji amp; Co. DSP Merrill Lynch served as the common financial adviser. IDBI said the appointed date for the merger has been fixed as October 1, 2004. IDBI Ltd has convened an extraordinary general meeting on February 23 to seek shareholder approval.

 IDBI chairman and managing director M. Damodaran said while IDBI Bank is already compliant with statutory liquidity ratio and cash reserve ratio norms, its merger partner has been given a timeframe to meet the necessary guidelines.

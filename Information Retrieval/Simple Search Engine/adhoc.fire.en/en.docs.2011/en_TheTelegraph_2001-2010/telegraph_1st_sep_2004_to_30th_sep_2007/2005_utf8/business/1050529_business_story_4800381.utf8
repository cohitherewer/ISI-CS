 Calcutta, May 28: The two principal promoters of Haldia Petrochemicals ? TCGs Purnendu Chatterjee and the Bengal government ? failed to sign the share-transfer deal after a three-hour board meeting today. Both said it was a complex transaction and they need time to come to a conclusion.

 Purnendu failed to say when he would be able to stump up the Rs 1,560 crore that the government wants in a single instalment. Purnendu is believed to have told the government that he needs the Reserve Banks permission if he decides to get foreign cash. The process will take some time.

 With elections drawing near, the Bengal government does not want to take a chance on the states largest project. We want to safeguard ourselves as a lot of money is involved in the deal, said commerce secretary Sabyasachi Sen. Sen is the government representative on the HPL board.

 There are no hurdles on the share transfer issue, but the inter se arrangement between the promoters were complex. It will take some time, HPL chairman Tarun Das said.

 The promoters today revealed their present shareholding in HPL. The total equity size of HPL is Rs 1,410 crore. Of this, the state holds 36.87 per cent (Rs 520 crore), The Chatterjee Petrochem Mauritius has 30.7 per cent (Rs 433 crore), The Chatterjee Petrochem India owns 10.99 per cent (Rs 155 crore), Tatas have 3.19 per cent (Rs 45 crore) and the remaining 18.22 per cent (Rs 257 crore) is with associates of TCG. 

 The HPL board today reviewed TCGs proposal on Basell investment as well as companys performance in 2004-05. HPL has registered a net profit of Rs 520 crore.

 The board today approved HPLs exit from corporate debt restructuring and refinancing of existing loans of HPL which will bring down the interest rate from 10.5 per cent to 8.75 per cent. HPL is the first company which has been able to come out of the CDR cell, he added. 

 The board formally accepted the new terms and conditions of the lenders, said Chatterjee.

 Expansion cash for StanChart on way

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Davies: Steady flow

 Mumbai, Feb. 16: Standard Chartered today promised continued investments in India, where it sees enough business opportunities to keep the tap of funds flowing.

 Having emerged as the largest foreign bank here, the focus now is on boosting the distribution network, expanding asset base and broadening future revenue streams.

 Group chief executive Mervyn Davies said this as he rattled off numbers for the year ended December 2004. The highlight of the scorecard was an operating profit of $195 million. This came on the back of interest income of $287 million and revenues computed at $466 million.

 Stressing the importance of India in Standard Chartered?s global plans, Davies said it is one of the two biggest opportunities for the bank, the other being China. ?We are on track. The focus on customer base and expanding revenues may slow the pace of operating profit in the short term, but it will be strong in the medium term.?

 Behind StanChart?s leadership are the 10 new branches that have taken the total number to 75 in 27 cities. The growth has been fuelled by rising sales of mortgages, credit cards, wealth management services, fixed-income products and trade finance. ?We are investing heavily because of the scale of opportunities,? he added.

 Among the more innovative products recently introduced by the bank in India was the Manhattan Card ? the first card in India and Singapore with risk-based pricing. Close to 1,20,000 such cards have been issued outside Hong Kong. In India, it was launched in three cities. It will be offered in three more over the next few months.

 In retail banking, strong asset growth boosted operating profits more than 100 per cent to $78 million in 2004 from $38 million in the previous year. Net revenues at $258 million exceeded the tallies of Malaysia, UAE and Africa. However, margins enjoyed by the bank shrunk in mortgages and deposit accounts even as its costs soared to $153 million. This was largely because of enhanced investments in risk management systems.

 In wholesale banking, Standard Chartered said the emergence of China and India as economic powerhouses was opening new trade corridors between them. The acquisition of Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporations business in India is expected to put the bank in a position where it can tap the opportunities thrown up by growing Indo-Japanese commerce.

 Providing more figures on the shape of wholesale banking in India, StanChart?s operating profit during 2004 fell to $141 million from $151 million last year.

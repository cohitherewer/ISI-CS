 CESC priority to Jharkhand, Haldia 

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Banerjee: Racing ahead

 Calcutta, Nov. 23: CESC has drawn up a plan to speed up its proposed thermal power stations in Jharkhand and Haldia. 

 The company is also in advanced talks with the Orissa government for signing a memorandum of understanding for a 2,000-mw power plant. The total cost of the project is Rs 8,000 crore.

 The pre-feasibility study for the greenfield 1,000-mw Jharkhand project will start soon. It will be a study on the land, water and coal linkages, managing director Sumantra Banerjee said.

 The estimated investment for the project is Rs 4,000 crore. The first phase will cover 2x250 mw and the second 1x500 mw. One of the three sites of Godda, Latehar and Chandil will be chosen as the project site, he added.

 The Jharkhand government is open to the RPG groups plans to export power from the state after meeting the requirements of the state. Work for the 1,000-mw power plant in Haldia has also begun, Banerjee said.

 The company is carrying out a study on the coal and rail linkages for the Haldia plant.

 We had a few rounds of discussions with the coal ministry. The government will announce a list of coal blocks by the end of this year. We are waiting for that, Banerjee said.

 CESC will start a fresh hunt for overseas funds for its 1,000-mw power plant in Jharkhand. 

 The company is mulling several options like foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs), GDR or a general loan for this new project, which will cost Rs 4,000 crore.

 The company has already floated a $40-million GDR issue to fund its 250-mw Budge Budge third unit. The total cost of this project is Rs 1,000 crore, which is being funded by an equity of Rs 300 crore and a debt of Rs 700 crore. However, the company is yet to receive environmental clearance from the central government.

 In the last two years, the company has approached foreign investors in Singapore and the US. The principal overseas lenders of CESC are IFC-Washington, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, ADB and Actis. The companys total foreign loans at current exchange rates are pegged at Rs 1,226 crore.

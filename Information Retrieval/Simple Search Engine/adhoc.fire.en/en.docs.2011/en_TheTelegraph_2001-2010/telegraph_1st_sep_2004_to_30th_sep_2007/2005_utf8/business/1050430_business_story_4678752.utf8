 Bengal taps UK body for power funds

 Calcutta, April 29: The Bengal government has placed a proposal before the UK government?s Department for International Development (DFID) for financial assistance to restructure the West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB).

 The basic tenets of the proposal include segregating the transmission and distribution functions of the board according to the Electricity Act, 2003, and manpower, financial and administrative restructuring of the board.

 WBSEB chairman M. K. De said, ?A proposal to restructure the board has been sent to DFID. Once the agency clears the proposal, the government will appoint a consultant through a global bidding process. The consultant will work out a roadmap for the recast.?

 WBSEB has written to the Union power ministry to extend the timeframe for unbundling by one year.

 DFID is already participating in Bengal?s initiative to restructure 17 of its sick public sector undertakings. The exercise will help the government reduce budget support to public sector enterprises and free public resources for more activities for the poor. DFID has committed a grant of ?26730000 for the entire exercise. 

 Manpower restructuring is a major issue before WBSEB. The average age of WBSEB employees is 56. Most of them are physically not strong enough to undertake field work. 

 There are 29,000 employees on the rolls of WBSEB on March 31, 2005.

 ?The restructuring does not envisage a drastic reduction in manpower. The utility would like to replace some of its aged employees with fresh blood. We cannot go on with a small workforce as we have to provide service to 45 lakh consumers across the state,? said senior WBSEB officials.

 DFID is expected to provide grant to WBSEB for offering compensation package to the employees who will opt for a voluntary retirement scheme.

 WBSEB is also keen to undertake a financial restructuring exercise. The board is servicing the existing loans from banks, Life Insurance Corporation of India, Power Finance Corporation and Rural Electricity Corporation.

 But the utility is unable to service the huge loans from the state government. The state government?s exposure in WBSEB is Rs 6,000 crore.

 The total interest accrued on the government loans is Rs 700 crore. 

 In 2004-05, WBSEB has, for the first time, paid back the government an interest of Rs 33 crore.

 WBSEB wants the government to write off Rs 3,000-3,500 crore. It is also open to the idea of converting the loan into equity.

 In 2004-05, WBSEB has been able to garner a revenue of Rs 4,800 crore and a cash surplus of Rs 270 crore.

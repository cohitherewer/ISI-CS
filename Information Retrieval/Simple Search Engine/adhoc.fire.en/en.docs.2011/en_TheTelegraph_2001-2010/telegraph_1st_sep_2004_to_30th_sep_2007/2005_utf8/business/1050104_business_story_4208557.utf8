 Panel on data security set for shakeup 

 M RAJENDRAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 3: The communications and information technology ministry is likely to revamp the existing committee on data protection and bring in greater transparency by opening its discussion to public participation.

 The existing committee with more than 18 members, representing the government, industry and legal experts, was set up in 2002 by former communications and information technology minister Pramod Mahajan. While the committee held a series of meetings, it had failed to come up with suggestions that could be incorporated in the Information Technology Act.

 The department of information technology under the communications ministry prepared a draft report for data protection. It was to be circulated to all the ministries concerned. But it was never discussed by the ministries.

 A senior communications ministry official, who is also a member of the committee, said, ?The differences over the issues were so strong that it was not possible to discuss the report. Further, there was indication from the government that it would like to incorporate the best of the laws on data protection. All the countries were and are still experimenting on the data protection laws.?

 The official said the new thrust for data protection laws has been made by the commerce ministry and it would play an important role.

 Department of information technology sources said, ?The existing committee did not have a specific time period. Even sub-committees on legal and other aspects are likely to be revamped and a deadline set. Many members of the committee have pointed out the need for more transparency and public participation, which is likely to be incorporated. We may put up the consultation on our website for public suggestion.? 

 Currently, the definition of data under the IT act is very broad and generic. But, the act needs to provide provisions for personal financial, health and insurance related data.

 Senior cyber law expert Pawan Duggal said, ?Many BPO companies are processing confidential information. The IT act is silent on this. We need to provide provisions for sensitive data like medical data and also protection to personal data.? 

 In India, the government is the biggest collector of data. Industry experts pointed that provisions need to be incorporated in the proposed amendment to IT act that will enable exemption of state in handling of personal data.

 The committee could not even push the compilation of ?minimum data set? for the proposed telemedicine project. The minimum data set is a set of health records that an individual may not like to be revealed and may be a security and commercial risk for him or his family. It is a widely accepted set of terms and definitions making up the core of data acquired for medical records.

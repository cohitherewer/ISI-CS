 Eyes CIL mines for output boost

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 28: The Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) has identified three mines of Coal India Ltd (CIL) to increase the availability of indigenous coking coal.

 SAIL chairman V.S. Jain today met his CIL counterpart in the city and urged the company to expedite work on the same.

 If required, SAIL can fund the development of these mines, Jain said. 

 It will invest Rs 116 crore to develop the Munidih-16 mine under Bharat Coking Coal Ltd, a CIL subsidiary.

 It could be adjusted with the companys coal bill to CIL. Similarly, Seam-15 of the Munidih mine and Kapuria block could be developed. Seam 15 and 16 would give SAIL 1.2 million tonnes of coking coal.

 At present, SAIL procures 60 per cent of its requirement from overseas. Due to a spike in global prices, the companys cost of production went up by 15 per cent last year.

 We managed to keep cost of production static between 1998 and 2003, but it went up last year, he said.

 Jain, however, hoped global coal prices would be less than this year. With plans to produce 20 mt of saleable steel by 2011-12, it will always remain dependent on imported coal even if domestic production is ramped up.

 To address this, it has decided to join hands with CIL to acquire coking coal assets abroad.

 Drug price tonic being readied 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Dec.3: A new policy will bring 314 essential drugs under a uniform pricing system. The policy, to be unveiled in January, would create the right atmosphere for a vibrant pharma industry, said Satwant Reddy, secretary in the department of chemicals and petrochemicals.

 The salient features of the policy are a uniform pricing mechanism, national health insurance for below-poverty-line families and a Rajasthan model of subsidised medicines for the urban and middle-class poor.

 Under the new policy, public-sector undertakings will be asked to shoulder the burden of bulk supplies, Reddy told reporters on the sidelines of the India-Africa-Asean and GCC Pharma and Health Conference. 

 She said all Indian drugs, particularly the life savings ones, will have a common MRP label by January. Forty out of 354 essential drugs will be outside the purview of the uniform pricing policy.

 The MRP on drugs and medicines would be made inclusive of local taxes to benefit customers. 

 The Centre is considering a comprehensive health insurance scheme to cover about 25 per cent of those living below the poverty line.

 We will introduce a health insurance plan for the poor under the new comprehensive drug policy, Sawant Reddy, secretary in the department of chemicals and petrochemicals, said.

 A special access programme for anti-cancer and HIV drugs was being worked out to help pharma companies involved in the development of these drugs, she said.

 To promote GMP (good manufacturing practices) in the pharmaceuticals industry, the Centre will cut sales tax 16 per cent to 8 per cent. 

 Reddy said none of the multinational companies have tied up with domestic players for cost-effective production of avian flu vaccines and drugs.

 Unplugged, the pesky power peddler

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 In a new light

 New Delhi, Oct. 31: The power of freedom appears to be on the way for bulk energy consumers who can now pick the company they would like to buy electricity from, provided they have a one mega watt (mw) connection.

 Under open access regulations issued by 19 state regulatory commissions, small-scale industries, hotels, commercial establishments or even a group of resident welfare associations with a 1-mw line can purchase power from any generating company within the state. 

 So, if a company keeps its users in the dark for too long, they can switch to a generator/distributor with better service.

 In not too distant a future therefore, buying power could be like signing up with a new mobile service operator. 

 However, for that to happen anytime soon, private power distribution companies will have to start laying their networks ? cables and transmission lines ? quickly.

 Bulk power consumers would be allowed to carry energy over distribution networks by paying wheeling charges and a surcharge that will help meet the requirement of cross-subsidy in their area of supply.

 The open access system will kick off in Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, Bengal, Gujarat, Delhi and Kerala.

 The Electricity Act, 2003 requires state power commissions to give consumers within five years the freedom to choose their energy supplier.

 The commissions have adopted two methods to bring down the tariffs to end-consumers by 10 to 15 per cent. Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Haryana will follow one method while Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttaranchal and Bengal have opted for another.

 Issues related to implementing open access for buyers are being co-ordinated by the Forum of Regulators, a statutory body for all power watchdogs headed by the chief of Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. 

 Tamil Nadu, for instance, will implement open access in three stages, starting with industrial consumers with lines of 10 MW and above; by December 2008, it will extend it to all consumers of 1 mw and above. 

 In Madhya Pradesh, consumers with lines of 10 mw and above have been allowed to choose sellers from June 2005; all consumers of 1 mw and above will be able to do so by October 2007. 

 Karnataka has provided open access to consumers above 15 mw from June 2005. A time-table extending it in a phased manner to those of 1 mw and above by April 2008 has been drawn up.

 In Gujarat, the system will take off for consumers above 5 mw from January 2006, when the task of implementing intra-state availability-based tariffs will be through. It will cover those of 1 mw and above two years later. Haryana and Chhattisgarh will switch over from 2006.

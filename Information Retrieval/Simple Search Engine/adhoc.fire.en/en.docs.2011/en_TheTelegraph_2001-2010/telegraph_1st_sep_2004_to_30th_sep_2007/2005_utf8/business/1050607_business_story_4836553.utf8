 Islamabad June 6: India and Pakistan today decided to set up a joint working group to chalk out the economic, technical and legal parameters for the proposed Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline. The decision was endorsed at a meeting here between petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar and Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz. 

 Aiyar said, It is our target to get the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline off the ground by January next year.

 It will take around four years to complete the project once work begins at the ground level. 

 The decision to constitute a joint working group marks a step forward in India-Pakistan co-operation in the hydrocarbon sector. 

 I am very encouraged by the Pakistani Prime Minister expressing our common desire to carry forward our decision on gas pipelines through Pakistan to India. 

 He told reporters that Aziz was keen on opting for the best international practices in terms of technology, finance and legal framework to build world-class pipeline infrastructure to feed our growing economies. 

 Aiyar said Pakistan had already assured India on its security concerns and we expect these to be woven in at the time of planning the route and technological parameters of the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline project. 

 A senior official told The Telegraph that apart from security concerns, it was crucial for India that the natural gas was made available at an affordable price. 

 The official Indian stand is that there have to be two back-to-back agreements on the pipeline. One between India and Iran and the other between Iran and Pakistan so that India and Pakistan do not directly sign a deal with each other. 

 The joint working group is expected to help resolve difficulties that would arise in drawing up the plans for the project. It will be headed by Indian petroleum secretary S. C. Tripathi and his Pakistani counterpart Ahmed Waqar. 

 Aiyar said a presentation was made on the gas economy of Pakistan. It showed that even though Pakistan had struck more gas, its demand for gas would far outstrip its domestic supplies.

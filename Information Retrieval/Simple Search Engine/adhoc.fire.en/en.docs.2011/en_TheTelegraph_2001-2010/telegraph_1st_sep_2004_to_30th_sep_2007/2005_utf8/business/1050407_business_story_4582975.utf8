 Fed chief concedes oil-price drag

 EDMUND L. ANDREWS

 Greenspan: Looking 

 ahead 

 Washington, April 6: Alan 

 Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said on Tuesday 

 that oil and natural gas markets were under the heaviest 

 strain in a generation and suggested that prices might remain 

 high for some time.

 But Greenspan was optimistic about 

 the long-run outlook for energy supplies, and he warned 

 against efforts to ?distort? or ?stifle? prices set in global 

 markets.

 Greenspan was silent about the 

 potential impact of higher oil prices on inflation or economic 

 growth, or on the central bank?s monetary policy.

 ?Markets for oil and natural gas 

 have been subject to a degree of strain over the past year 

 not experienced for a generation,? he said in a speech beamed 

 by satellite to petrochemical executives in Texas.

 Noting that investment in new 

 production capacity has lagged the growth in demand for 

 oil, particularly from China, Greenspan said much of the 

 ?slack? in world energy markets has disappeared.

 ?For years, long-term prospects 

 for oil and gas prices appeared benign,? Greenspan said. 

 ?The recent shift in expectations, however, has been substantial 

 enough and persistent enough to bias business investment 

 decisions in favour of energy cost reduction.?

 Though Greenspan conceded that 

 higher oil prices had caused only a ?modest? reduction in 

 demand so far, he predicted that higher prices over the 

 long run would lead to higher investment in extraction technologies, 

 exploration and unconventional sources of energy like methane 

 gas frozen in arctic ice.

 Investors had little reaction 

 to the Fed chairman?s remarks, which some analysts interpreted 

 as fairly sanguine.

 Prices of crude oil hit a record 

 of $58.28 a barrel on Monday, but receded to $56.04 on Tuesday.

 Higher oil prices tend to slow 

 domestic economic growth, because they pinch consumer spending 

 on goods and services produced in the United States. But 

 they also push up inflation.

 Greenspan and other top Fed officials 

 have argued in recent years that higher prices have relatively 

 little effect on the underlying inflation rate and that 

 they pose less threat to growth than in the 1970s and 1980s 

 because energy has become a smaller part of total economy.

 But Fed officials have stepped 

 up their warnings about inflation in the last month. The 

 central bank warned after its past policy meeting on March 

 22 that inflation pressures had increased, even though inflation 

 expectations were still ?well-contained?.

 The central bank also said it 

 saw little evidence that higher energy prices had led to 

 higher prices in the rest of the economy, but it noted that 

 companies had more ?pricing power? than before.

 Greenspan studiously avoided any 

 comment about the macroeconomic implications of current 

 energy prices.

 Instead, he focused on the issues 

 that appear to be driving prices at the moment.

 He noted that demand for oil had 

 climbed sharply but speculated that prices had also been 

 driven higher by concerns about the shortfalls of investment 

 in both crude oil production and refineries.

 Natural gas prices have been kept 

 high in the United States, he said, largely because of the 

 limited infrastructure for importing natural gas from overseas. 

 Gas prices, he said, have been ?notably higher? in the United 

 States than in other parts of the world.

 In the long run, he said, higher 

 energy prices should lead to higher production of oil and 

 natural gas as well as new sources of energy.

 ?We must remember that the same 

 price signals that are so critical for balancing energy 

 supply and demand in the short run also signal profit opportunities 

 for long-term supply expansion,? he said.

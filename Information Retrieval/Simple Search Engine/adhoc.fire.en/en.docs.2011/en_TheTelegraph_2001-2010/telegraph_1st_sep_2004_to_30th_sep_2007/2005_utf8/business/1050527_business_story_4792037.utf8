 Another meeting on petro prices next week

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 26: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said another meeting will be held early next week to discuss the petro-price hike.

 He told newspersons here that the meeting (held today) has been inconclusive and there will be another early next week to decide on the price hike issue.

 The minister said a number of options on petroleum product pricing were examined at the meeting and the petroleum ministry has been asked to come back with some new calculations

 Skyrocketing international crude prices have brought the public sector oil companies under immense financial strain and there are strong economic reasons for increasing domestic prices of petroleum goods. 

 However, the government has not allowed the oil companies to go in for a price increase due to its political compulsions. 

 Crude purchases account for as much as 90 per cent of the cost of production of petroleum products and there is little that the oil companies can do to cut costs when international prices soar. Over 75 per cent of the countrys crude requirements are being currently met through imports.

 The high level of taxes on petroleum goods is another bone of contention between the petroleum and finance ministries.

 The finance ministry claims that excise and customs duty changes introduced in this years budget are revenue neutral. 

 However, the petroleum ministry has stated that the increase in excise duty on petrol and diesel and additional 50 paise road cess on the two fuels, which has not been passed on to the consumers, has led to a drain of Rs 2.50 per litre on petrol and Rs 1.35 per litre on diesel from the coffers of the oil companies.

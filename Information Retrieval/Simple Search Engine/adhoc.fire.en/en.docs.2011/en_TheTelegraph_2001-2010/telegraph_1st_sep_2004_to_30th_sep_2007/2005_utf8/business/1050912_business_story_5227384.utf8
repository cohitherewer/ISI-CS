The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Centre digs out dues from Ravva fields

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Drill Duel

 New Delhi, Sept. 11: The consortium comprising Cairn Energy of the UK, the Dhoots of Videocon and Marubeni of Japan have been forced to cough up Rs 800 crore as part of the governments share of profit from the eastern offshore Ravva oilfields after losing a hard-fought battle at arbitration tribunals in London and The Hague. 

 The consortium that had taken over the ONGC-discovered Ravva oilfields in the mid-nineties as part of the Centres policy to privatise the fields had been calculating the costs in a manner so as to understate the governments share of the profit. The government had questioned their accounting methods, but the consortium refused to veer around. With huge payments being stuck up in these fields, the government had to take recourse to the expensive arbitration proceedings abroad.

 A senior petroleum ministry official told The Telegraph that the government finally got the money in July and August this year.

 A case for another Rs 800 crore under dispute with the consortium, has been filed in the Malaysian High Court at Kuala Lumpur. This is the court of jurisdiction according to the agreement signed with the company earlier when the fields were awarded. 

 The privatisation of the mid-sized ONGC-discovered oilfields in the mid-nineties is turning out to be a rather nasty experience for the country.

 Videocon had also triggered a major controversy earlier by taking a huge loan against the entire in-place reserves of the Ravva oilfields in which ONGC has a 40 per cent share. The government had even issued a notice threatening to throw the company out of the joint venture but it managed to wriggle out.

 The contracts to privatise the oilfields, signed in a haste during Satish Sharmas tenure as petroleum minister, make it easier for private firms to exploit the ambiguities and the governments task becomes that much more difficult. 

 The international arbitration tribunal at London had earlier upheld the governments stand against Videocon in the dispute over the timing of payments from the Ravva fields. The tribunal had ruled that the private firms should pay the government its share of the profit as soon as crude oil and gas from these fields are sold.

 Videocon had taken the stand that the production-sharing contract does not specify the exact time within which the amount has to be paid. Hence, the company can pay at its own time.

 Cotton textile exporters cry foul over duty blow

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 MOUNTING PRESSURE

 Mumbai, Jan. 23: The cotton textile export industry is feeling the heat again. The government has brought down drawback rates for cotton textile products and this comes only days after those of duty entitlement pass book (DEPB) have been reduced.

 The industry has criticised the move as it has compounded the pressure on prices, which was already hit due to the removal of quotas. Drawback rates for the cotton textile sector has been brought down between 24 per cent and 47 per cent for fabrics and 64 per cent and 71 per cent for made-up items like bed linen and terry towels.

 According to Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council (Texprocil) chairman B. K. Patodia, these reductions were uncalled for at a time when over 350 exporters of made-ups/furnishing articles have negotiated substantial contracts at the just concluded Heimtextile Fair in Frankfurt at the prevailing rates. The sharp and sudden reduction in drawback rates has disrupted the contracts signed, he added.

 Patodia said the council has already submitted to the government data on transaction costs, which showed that there was an incidence of around 8 per cent on various accounts, which was not being rebated under the present schemes. 

 With the phasing out of the DEPB scheme by March, a suitable revision of duty drawback rates was expected to neutralise some of the exporters? transaction costs, which do not enjoy any rebate.

 ?However, the sharp reduction in the drawback rates has shown that the taxes, on which there are no rebates, will have to be borne by exporters, which would strongly affect the competitiveness of their products,? he observed. 

 Patodia, who is also the vice-chairman and managing director of GTN Textiles, said with the proposed VAT scheme not likely to cover textiles, at least for the next financial year, exporters will be under pressure to match competitive prices of suppliers from China, Pakistan, Brazil and Thailand. The manufacturing costs in these countries are much lower than that in India. 

 Highlighting various anomalies in the present rates, he said the rates for dyed yarn, dyed fabrics, dyed made-ups and terry towels were the same irrespective of the value realised on exports of these products.

 Indians reveal appetite for labels in food picks

 AN EYE FOR DETAIL

 Mumbai, Aug. 28: Indians are among the world?s more conscious food shoppers, revealed an online survey conducted by AC Nielsen.

 The survey put India on its global list of top-10 countries of most conscious food shoppers who ?always? check the nutritional labels. A third of the country?s netizens, who responded to the survey, claimed to always check food labels.

 AC Nielsen said about 41 per cent consumers in India check nutritional labels when purchasing a product for the first time. They are most alert when buying food products for children. The survey said 21 per cent of the Indian consumers check nutritional labels when buying food products for children. This proportion is higher than any other country.

 ?This outlines the need for marketers of children?s food products to place a special emphasis on the information they provide. In many cases, the information determines whether or not the consumer will purchase the product. It can be used to entice, inform and acquire consumers,? says Sonia Pall, director client services, AC Nielsen.

 The survey also found that though consumers check labels, they don?t necessarily understand it. Half of the respondents admit that they only ?partly? understand the nutritional labels on food packs. 

 About 60 per cent of the Asia-Pacific respondents do not understand the nutritional levels followed by Europeans. 

 The survey said 50 per cent of the customers in Europe do not understand the labels. In Latin America, 45 per cent of the respondents confessed to the same ignorance.

 In India too, consumers don?t fully comprehend food labels ? 46 per cent admit that they partially understand labels, while 5 per cent don?t understand anything.

 The ingredients that are often checked by consumers are fat (49 per cent), calories (43 per cent), sugar (42 per cent), colouring and additives (36 per cent). 

 In India, the fat and calorie contents in food attract the most attention ? 52 per cent claim to check food labels for fat content regularly. 

 Preservatives and colouring are other ingredients that 44-45 per cent of Indians look out for.

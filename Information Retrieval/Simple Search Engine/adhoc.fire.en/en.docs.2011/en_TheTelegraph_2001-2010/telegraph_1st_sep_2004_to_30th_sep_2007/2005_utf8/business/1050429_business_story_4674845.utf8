The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Not much sweat to make a splash in style

 The bathroom has been transformed into a designer haven having sophisticated gadgetry with push-button effects. It is positioned as the place to unwind and relax in the hustle and bustle of today?s stress-filled life and hence design dictates every nook.

 But is this the situation for a select few alone or for the general structures at large? Could something be done with the bathrooms thrust upon the hapless prospective flat buyer to make it ?more than just a room without flushing good money literally down the drain??

 Divide and rule

 The most important factor in the beginning is to separate the wet area from the dry area ? i.e. to confine the wet area to the shower or bathing space while keeping the remaining portion as dry as possible. This allows one to play with the dry areas in a myriad of ways without the fear of a tsunami lashing it every minute.

 To achieve this, early intervention at the planning stage itself is needed. Keeping the WC or commode at one end and the shower at the other end, with the washbasin in the centre, is one option. However, keeping the shower in the centre ensures that bathroom will remain wet for a long time.

 If done at the very beginning, it entails no additional cost but if attempted later, it implies fiddling with the plumbing pipes and the tiling.

 Floor ?em

 Tiles are the most popular wall cladding and flooring that are used in bathrooms. Any stone flooring (like marble) is also acceptable. It requires a little ingenuity at no additional cost to add a dash of colour or a border to lend a little zest to the walls. 

 The flooring can have a small pattern instead of being completely flat. Old house owners can use commonly available adhesives to tile these days without having to dismantle existing claddings. As this is the mass of colour that one sees, a little care goes a long way in achieving a space which looks and feels inviting.

 Fittings and fixtures

 Before being tempted into buying that gadget which spouts the miracle water, the most important thing to remember is that the water available may contain minerals which will scar the tap with stains in no time at all. Most of these gadgets require slight modifications in plumbing. So it is advisable to make a decision on this, too, early.

 Of course, there is no doubt that these fancy fittings and fixtures look great and work great, too. Washbasins come in a variety of sizes and shapes and you can consider a counter basin or a simple basin with a pedestal.

 Counters are made of stone and the bottom portion could be covered for extra storage. The commode or throne of the room comes in various styles and seats as well and one can consider the price options.

 The wash

 A lot of people find it difficult to place the washing machine in the bathroom and what does one do for washing clothes?

 While hand-washing on a tiled floor, if there are chances of a war being waged on the flooring, the tiles are liable to break. So one can consider a small portion with stone flooring. 

 If there is space, it is better to accommodate the washing machine in the bathroom. But as this is generally not the situation, the easiest alternative is to provide an inflow for water and a drain for the waste water at a convenient spot just outside the bathroom, if possible. or in a balcony. 

 If you have more than one bathroom, one could be set aside for such utilitarian tasks.

 Storage

 Though storage requirements are less in a bathroom, people tend to build lofts to provide for dead storage. The materials used should be chosen and treated to prevent water-absorption and sufficient breathing room should be allowed to prevent dampness from setting into these spaces.

 The area below the wash basin is good for everyday items of use and more space can be found on the wall for cabinets. 

 Mirror, mirror?

 The heart of the room is the area where the mirror is. It makes actors out of all of us and the idea here is to have the light on the person rather than on the mirror ? and sufficient light. Small shelves and accessories could be added. In fact, open shelving is very useful in the shower area as well. 

 A newspaper rack and small plants all add to make the room come closer to the space of tranquillity that one searches for. It is worth investing in a distortion-free mirror unless one wants to be in the house of horrors.

 A bathroom could be done up with very little cost if one plans well and puts in the extra clothes peg; the bag for soiled linen and a simple shower curtain along with few footmats and a shelves. It can also have a Jacuzzi and a shower cubicle and a bathtub. 

 The price can range from a few thousands to six digits. Ultimately, it is your lifestyle that will dictate the impression that you choose for this space.

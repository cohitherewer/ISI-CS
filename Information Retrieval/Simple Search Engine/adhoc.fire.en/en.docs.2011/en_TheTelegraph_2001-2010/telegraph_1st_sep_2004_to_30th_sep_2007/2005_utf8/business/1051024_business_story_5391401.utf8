The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 BCG to help recast Force 

 OUR BUREAU

 Calcutta, Oct. 23: Force Motors, formerly known as Bajaj Tempo, is planning to decentralise its operations and outsource businesses. 

 The automobile company has hired the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) to help in restructuring the organisation.

 The restructuring is being done to make the organisation leaner and trimmer so that the company can optimally align with the emerging global demands.

 Each of our businesses operate in a different market segment and so we need to have entities which are better aligned on the one hand with the markets in India and internationally on the other, Force Motors chairman and managing director Abhay Firodia.

 The company hopes to take a final call on the restructuring after BCG submits its report next month. 

 BCG will examine the realities of our businesses and advise us the best way these diverse businesses can be handled, Firodia said.

 Under consideration is the creation of dedicated business entities. These could be in the form of divisions, independent companies or strategic business units, he added.

 The firm has five product lines in commercial vehicles: three-wheeler Minidor, light commercial vehicle Traveller and utility vehicle like Trax, tractors and heavy commercial vehicles in technical collaboration with MAN Industries of Germany.

 Market and international business development can happen better only when one has the right structure, Firodia said. Force Motors, which had recorded a lower turnover in the previous fiscal due to inter-labour rivalry, is hoping to get back on track soon.

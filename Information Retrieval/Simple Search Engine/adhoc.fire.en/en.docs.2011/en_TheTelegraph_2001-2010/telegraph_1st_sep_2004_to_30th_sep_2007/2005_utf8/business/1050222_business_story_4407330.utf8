 Financial planners press for regulatory body

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 21: The Association of Financial Planners has approached the ministry of finance with a proposal to set up a self-regulatory organisation for advisers. 

 The association wants an investor-centric framework. ?We are talking to ministry officials on the issue and have presented certain recommendations for the forthcoming budget for the industry,? said Ranjeet S. Mudholkar.

 ?There are regulatory frameworks in developed countries which guide financial planners. However, in India, financial planning profession is yet to gain popularity,? said Mudholkar. In the evolving financial services market, almost everyone calls themselves planners. 

 ?It is important to distinguish between advising and selling. There should be a minimum certification standard for a financial planner and a product seller,? he said.

 The recommendation also suggests compulsory disclosure of commissions paid to financial planners, agents or advisers of mutual funds and insurance.

 ?That way an investor, who subscribes to a product, will be aware of the commission being charged by his distributor or adviser. This will lead to greater transparency in the product distribution process,? said Mudholkar.

 The association expects a mandate to act as the self-regulatory organisation. ?We are ready to work closely with the government and establish a controlled atmosphere for the functioning of the financial planners,? he added.

 In recent years, a number of countries ? developed and developing ? have made attempts to better align their financial supervisory and regulatory architecture to the changing landscape. Some have opted for a unified regulator (UK, Japan, Korea, Canada) or a unified oversight board (South Africa) or a unified supervision model.

 These countries? experiences show that there is no single ideal structure for financial supervision and regulation. Issues relevant to supervisors in large countries may not be as important to smaller nations, where issues such as concentrated ownership, concentrated wealth and foreign ownership of financial institutions are more critical. 

 However, the experience of other countries can be valuable.

 The proposed ISO standards for personal financial planning, in addition to regulation and professional designations, may achieve a more universal approach to what consumers can expect in the quality of advice and service provided by financial planners. These standards are expected to be finalised by November 2005.

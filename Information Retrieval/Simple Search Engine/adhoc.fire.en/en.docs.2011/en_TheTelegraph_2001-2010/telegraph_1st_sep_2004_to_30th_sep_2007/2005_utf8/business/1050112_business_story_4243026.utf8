 Calcutta, Jan. 11: Texas Instruments is focussing on developing a single chip that will facilitate the distribution of wireless and broadband applications through mobile phones.

 The $12-million semiconductor major has identified digital subscriber line (DSL), cable modem, VoIP (voice over Internet protocol) and wireless LAN as key areas within the segment.

 Texas Instruments India managing director Biswadip Mitra said, ?This year will see a huge rollout of broadband in India. We are developing the home broadband market and are also working on chips that will run applications on a 3G network with the cellphone turning into a convergence device for communications.?

 The 3G mobile communications technology promises increased bandwidth up to 384 Kbps when a device is stationary or moving at pedestrian speed, 128 Kbps in a car and 2 mbps in fixed applications. 3G will work over wireless air interfaces such as GSM, TDMA, and CDMA. The new EDGE (enhanced data rate for global evolution) air interface has been developed specifically to meet the bandwidth needs of 3G.

 Texas Instruments is developing the first digital TV on a single chip for cellphones, which will capture broadcast signals and allow users to watch channels on a real-time basis.

 The 3G network that will help carry these signals will be paired with audio to give the viewer an experience similar to viewing a TV compared with the 1-to-15 frames per second streaming capability at present.

 Texas Instruments is also working on the residential gateway market or home broadband segment that will allow users to access several applications through a common gateway and pay a unified bill. ?The wireless product will facilitate using home devices like TV, set-top box, telephone, Internet and remote surveillance systems through a common connection within the boundaries of the home,? said Mitra.

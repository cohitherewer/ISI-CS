 Radico taste for cheap liquor

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Calcutta, July 2: Radico Khaitan plans to enter the economic liquor segment by acquiring distilleries in the southern parts.

 President (sales and marketing) R. Vaziraney said, Almost 60 per cent sales in the economy segment comes from the south. Therefore, while making an entry into the segment, it is wise to look at that market.

 The company is present in the upper segment of the liquor market and is the second largest distillery in the country.

 Vaziraney said though the company will look at inorganic growth as and when the opportunity arises, its main focus will be on organic growth. This is because we are witnessing huge growth in the sales of our brands, he said. Last year, the company witnessed a 58 per cent growth in sales volume compared with the industry growth of around 8-9 per cent.

 He said there can be two types of acquisitions. The first is acquiring bottling plants, which substantially reduces the cost of production. The second is buying distilleries, whereby one also acquires the brands of the target unit.

 The company has earmarked an investment of Rs 85 crore for the current financial year to acquire bottling units in the south and enhance its existing spirit producing capacities.

 Apart from this, we shall also allocate further funds to buy distilleries, depending on the requirement and valuations, added Vaziraney.

 Radico has recently launched gin under the brand name of Magic Moments and also plans to launch vodka, said Vaziraney.

 The company has also launched 8 p.m. Bermuda white rum and expects the brand extension to contribute 5 per cent of the total sales value of the company, he added. The highest contributor, in value terms, is 8 p.m. whisky at 33 per cent, Contessa rum at 27 per cent and Old Admiral brandy at 14 per cent. 

 We expect a minimum 25 per cent growth for the current fiscal, added Vaziraney.

 Calcutta, March 29: Samsung India is planning to sell 50 per cent more mobile phones this year compared with the previous year.

 ?Last year, on an average, we sold more than 1 lakh mobile phones per month. Although for the first quarter of the current year, the average sales was around 80,000 handsets per month, we plan to exceed the volume by 50 per cent,? said H. C. Ryu, director (sales and marketing), Samsung India. He was addressing the media at the national launch of SGH-D 500 mobile phone. The phone was selected as the world?s best mobile handset at the 3GSM Association World Congress at Cannes in February and is priced at Rs 22,499.

 Ryu further said mobile phones should contribute 25 per cent of Samsung?s total revenue in the country as against 17 per cent last year.

 The company is a dominant player in the colour and camera phone market and expects 80 per cent of its handset sales this year to come from this segment. In value terms, Samsung controls 60 per cent of the of the colour and camera phone market.

 ?We will fuel the growth by continuously introducing products with latest technology and by incorporating minor changes required for the Indian market,? Ryu said.

 The company is studying the developments in the Indian market and would also consider setting up a manufacturing unit here, he added.

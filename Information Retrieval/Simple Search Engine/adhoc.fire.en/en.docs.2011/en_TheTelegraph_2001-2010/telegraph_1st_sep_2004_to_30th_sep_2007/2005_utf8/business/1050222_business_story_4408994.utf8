 Calcutta, Feb. 21: The Boston Consulting Group will chalk out a restructuring plan for Punjab National Bank (PNB). 

 The restructuring exercise will involve streamlining the four-tier system of the bank, setting up an integrated risk management system, scrutinising product profitability and centralisation of back office operations.

 ?This is the second round of restructuring for the bank. BCG will submit the report soon. We hope to implement the restructuring package within the next six to 12 months,? said S. S. Kohli, chairman and managing director of the bank.

 In 1999, the bank had undertaken a restructuring exercise. A core banking solutions was introduced then.

 The bank has also asked international consultant Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu to carry out a survey for floating a subsidiary in the UK. The bank is actively considering a foray into the UK, Hong Kong and Singapore, while awaiting the Reserve Bank?s approval for an insurance venture in India.

 On the IFCI merger, Kohli said PNB have given three riders. ?If the government agrees then they can go ahead with the merger,? Kohli said. 

 The three riders are; the government should provide Rs 3,200 crore to PNB to make up for the losses of IFCI; PNB should get fiscal incentive under section 72 (A) of the Income Tax Act for carrying forward the losses of IFCI; and PNB will take over only the good assets (Rs 11,000 crore) of IFCI and not the bad ones (Rs 9,000 crore).

 ?We had sent these conditions to the government in January last year. We have not heard anything from them till now.?

 However, the bank?s top brass feels that the government cannot unilaterally merge IFCI with PNB. ?The shareholders of the bank may oppose the move,? said K. C. Chakrabarty, executive director of the bank.

 PNB Gilts, which had suffered a loss of Rs 0.87 billion in the first six months of the current fiscal, has decided to enter the merchant banking business in a big way.

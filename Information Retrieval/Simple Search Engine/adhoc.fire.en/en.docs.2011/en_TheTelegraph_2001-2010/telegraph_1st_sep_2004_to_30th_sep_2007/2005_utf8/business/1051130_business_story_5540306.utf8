 Break in five-day rally

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, Nov. 29: The five-session long bull run on the Bombay Stock Exchange was checked today as the sensex ? the main barometer of stock market sentiments ? suffered a setback after breaching the 9000-mark yesterday.

 The BSE 30-share sensitive index closed 64 points down in volatile trade due to fresh profit-selling at higher levels.

 The index had opened firm at 9000.65 against yesterdays close of 8994.94. However, later it fell sharply on fresh bouts of heavy selling. 

 After touching a low of 8875.82, the sensex ended at 8931.16, a loss of 63.78 points, or 0.71 per cent, over the last close.

 Since Wednesday, the index had gained by a whopping 396.19 points on heavy buying by the foreign institutional investors.

 The broad-based BSE-100 index declined by 27.80 points to end at 4715.94 from yesterdays close of 4743.93.

 The BSE-200 index and the Dollex-200 also dropped to 1128.82 and 409.27 from the previous close of 1135.26 and 411.43, respectively. The BSE-500 index fell by 20.24 points to 3609.35 from the last close of 3629.59 and the Dollex-30 ended lower at 1596.80 from yesterdays close of 1607.50.

 Core sector slows

 Infrastructure growth slowed down to 4.9 per cent in October from 15.9 per cent a year ago, mainly due to a fall in the output of crude petroleum and refinery products.

 The six core sectors ? crude petroleum, refinery, coal, electricity, cement and steel ? posted a lower growth of 4.6 per cent during the April-October period of 2005 compared with 6.8 per cent in the year-ago period.

 Costly jute trims mill working week

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 16: Factories under the Indian Jute Mills Association (Ijma) have made up their minds to switch to a six-day work week as part of a larger attempt to cope with soaring prices of the widely- used natural fibre.

 Ijma chairman Arun Bajoria told reporters here today there was a threat of block closure at mills if the situation arising out of high raw material prices did not improve.

 Prices of TD-5 jute increased Rs 200 per quintal during the first two weeks of this month from Rs 1050 earlier. Even the current rate of Rs 1350 per quintal has not ensured that the mills get adequate supplies to meet their day-to-day requirement of the key input, he said.

 The mills predicament follows a decision by the Jute Corporation of India (JCI) to charge what Ijma calls a highly speculative price of Rs 1,500 per quintal for supply of the BT will variety used in manufacture of sacks.

 Bajoria argued that the public-sector company was justified in linking raw jute procurements under the minimum support price (MSP) system to the BT will allocation for mills. However, the connection does not stand in case of commercial purchases made by Jute Corp.

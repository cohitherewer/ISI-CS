 Securitised debt pool widens

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 11: The participation of public sector banks in securitisation, a process through which loan portfolios are converted into marketable securities, is poised for a big leap in the months ahead as they will look at ways to upgrade the quality of their balance sheets.

 So far, securitisation has been dominated by private and foreign banks and nationalised ones have largely stayed out.

 However, banking analysts say the trend is set to change following recent developments, one of which was the governments decision to clear a proposal to amend the Securities and Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956. 

 While the amendment would bring securitised debt under the definition of securities, it is expected that Parliament will also clear the move with a provision to allow listing of such instruments. A major boost from this would be that banks investments in such instruments will go up. At present, such investments are low because of restrictions on exposure to unlisted paper.

 This apart, securitisation is also projected to go up in view of the upcoming Basel II regulations. These rules, which will be implemented from March 2007, would make it mandatory for banks to allocate capital based on their risk. Therefore, assets that carry higher risk would need greater capital allocation.

 Experts argue that in such a scenario, the process of securitisation can be a good balance sheet management tool as capital can be released by bringing down the risk weighted assets. According to JP Morgan, for every $1 of reduction in risk weighted assets, a bank releases $0.08 capital.

 Securitisation is a process through which assets are packaged, converted into tradable securities called pass through certificates and sold to third-party investors. Depending on the type of receivables securitised, the resulting instrument is referred to as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in the case of housing loans, collateralised bond obligations (CBOs) in the case of bond receivables and collateralised loans obligations (CLOs) in the case of industrial loan receivables. 

 While public sector banks, which also own retail assets in their portfolios, have played a negligible role as originators in securitisation, in few instances, they have remained as investors of securitised paper. However, banking circles observe that few banks are now looking at the possibility of securitisation. 

 Union Bank of India, that has bought assets worth Rs 600 crore of other banks, is one such PSU bank that is looking at securitising a small fragment of its advances.

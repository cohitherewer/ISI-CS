 Calcutta, July 9: The draft power tariff policy, to be tabled before the Union cabinet shortly for its final approval, aims to provide some relief to end-users of energy. 

 If a consumer has to suffer load-shedding and poor quality of power, the utility may have to pay compensation. The consumers may even get financial benefit if the quality of power is poor. The Centre?s new power tariff policy has a penalty provision on the quality of service, which will be determined by regional regulators.

 ?The regulatory commissions will have the authority to force power utilities to issue cheques to consumers if they fail to provide quality service. The utilities may also have to pay back consumers if they provide poor quality power,? Ajay Shankar, additional secretary in the Union power ministry, said at a seminar on the national electricity policy organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry here today. 

 According to the draft tariff policy, the state regulatory commissions should determine and notify the standards of performance of licensees. It is desirable that the forum of regulators determines the basic framework on service standards, the policy says.

 ?A suitable transition framework could be provided for the licensees to reach the desired levels of service as quickly as possible. Penalties may be imposed on licensees in accordance with Section 57 of the Electricity Act for failure to meet the standards,? Shankar added.

 The regulatory commissions of all the states are currently in the process of determining the standards of performance.

 The Union power ministry is also contemplating to adopt an annuity-based model for transmission and distribution of power projects.

 Shankar said the government was thinking of using an annuity-based bidding process for transmission and distribution of power to attract private investment.

 The ministry feels that the model is expected to be successful as investors will get risk-free fixed returns on their investments and, at the same time, it will de-link revenue generation from income.

 Moreover, the model will also provide for the cost of power transportation to the consumer to be factored into the pricing.

 This model has been in use for road infrastructure and highway projects in the country and has proved to be successful, Shankar added.

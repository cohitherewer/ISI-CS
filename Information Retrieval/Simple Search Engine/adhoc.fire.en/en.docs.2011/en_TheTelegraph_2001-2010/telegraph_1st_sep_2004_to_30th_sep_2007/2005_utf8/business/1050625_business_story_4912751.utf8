 Natural gas to become costlier

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 24: The price of natural gas will go up by a minimum of 12 per cent from July 1, raising the cost of production for fertiliser, power, steel and petrochemicals companies, which draw gas from Gails Hazira-Bijapur-Jagdishpur pipeline. 

 Petroleum ministry has issued an order to increase the consumer price of gas for power and fertiliser units to Rs 3,200 per thousand standard cubic meters per day (MMSCMD) from Rs 2,850 per MMSCMD. 

 The price of natural gas sold to private companies engaged in other businesses has been raised to $3.86 per million British thermal unit, which is the landed price of liquefied natural gas. This works out to Rs 6,740 per MMSCMD. 

 The 12 per cent rise in feedstock cost would result in power tariff increasing by 67 paise per unit.

 The fuel bill of power and fertiliser units will go up by Rs 17 crore per annum for every MMSCMD of gas consumed by them. For petrochemcials, steel and other industries, the bill will rise by Rs 135 crore for every MMSCMD of gas consumed, an official said.

 Reliance and British Gas, which have a share in the ONGC-discovered Tapti and Panna-Mukta gas fields, will be major gainers. ONGC is set to earn an additional revenue of Rs 1,600 crore.

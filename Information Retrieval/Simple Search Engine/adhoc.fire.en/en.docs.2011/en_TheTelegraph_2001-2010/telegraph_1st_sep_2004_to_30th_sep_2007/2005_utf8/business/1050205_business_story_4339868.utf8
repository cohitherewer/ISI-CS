 Nirula?s outlets at Indian Oil pumps

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 4: Nirula?s, the Delhi-based restaurant chain, has entered into a strategic alliance with Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) to open a chain of outlets at the latter?s petrol stations across the country.

 Nirula?s, one of the pioneers of a successful fast-food restaurant chain business in the country, was hit hard by the advent of big daddy McDonald?s. The home-grown chain was on the lookout for a big-time alliance partner, which could help it go national. The desi chain has now latched on to the desi Fortune 500 public sector undertaking. 

 A memorandum of understanding (MoU) to this effect was signed between the two companies today. Signatories to the agreement were T. L. Jain, executive director (retail sales) of IOC, and J. S. Grover, vice-president of Nirulas.

 Nirulas technical adviser Vikas Attri said, ?Under the agreement, Nirula?s will set up family-style restaurants, express stores with ice-cream parlours and take-away counters (depending on quantum of spaces available) in various IOC retail outlets across India in a phased manner.?

 The move is being seen as a clear step for Nirula?s to go national. The expansion plans include the north and the Mumbai area in different phases. These are the strongholds of McDonalds as well.

 The family-style restaurants are the most popular format of Nirula?s self-service outlets. Of the 66 units that Nirula?s have at present, 34 are family-style restaurants. The other units include three hotels, express outlets and ice-cream parlours.

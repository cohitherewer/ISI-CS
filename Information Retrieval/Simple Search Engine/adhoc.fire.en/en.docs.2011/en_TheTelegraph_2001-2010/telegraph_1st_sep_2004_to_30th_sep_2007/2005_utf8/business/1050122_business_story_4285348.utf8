 Bangalore, Jan. 21: Riding a growth wave in outsourcing by global customers, Wipro posted a robust 56 per cent rise in third-quarter net profit at Rs 427 crore.

 Revenue spiralled 39 per cent year-on-year to Rs 2,110 crore. Profit before interest and tax (PBIT) soared 66 per cent to Rs 476 crore, while PBIT from its global IT services and products grew 65 per cent to Rs 414 crore. 

 Chairman Azim Premji said: ?We continued our strong performance into the third quarter with revenue from the global IT business growing to $352 million, $5 million more than the guidance of $347 million we provided at the beginning of the quarter. Our strategy of offering an integrated solution to customers continues to pay off, as demonstrated by the healthy sequential growth.? 

 ?We expect revenues from the global IT services and products business to touch $370 million in the quarter ending March 2005,? he added.

 Premji said the global IT services division added 26 clients during the quarter, with 16 of them in R amp;D and 10 in enterprise services. Wipro Infotech, the IT services and products business in India, West Asia and Asia Pacific posted a revenue of Rs 342 crore, a growth of 45 per cent year-on-year and a PBIT of Rs 27.2 crore, up 69 per cent.

 Wipro vice-chairman Vivek Paul said: ?This quarter saw a 1 per cent sequential improvement in price realisation for both onsite as well as offshore projects. We have seen double-digit sequential growth in the sale of our solutions for financial services, telecom and manufacturing businesses. In terms of service lines too, our technology infrastructure and testing services recorded a double-digit sequential growth. Revenues in this segment were $352 million, ahead of our guidance of $347 million. The annualised employee attrition came down to 12 per cent.?

 During the quarter, Wipro hired 2,274 IT professionals to take the headcount to 39,337. Of them, 24,997 are in the IT services business and the remaining 14,340 in IT-enabled services.

 According to Suresh Senapaty, corporate executive vice-president, proactive hedging and operational improvements helped mitigate the impact of higher employee compensation and rupee appreciation on operating margins of its global IT business.

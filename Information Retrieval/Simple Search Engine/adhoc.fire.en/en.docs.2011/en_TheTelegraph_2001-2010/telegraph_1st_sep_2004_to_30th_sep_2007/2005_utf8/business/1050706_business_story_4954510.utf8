 New Delhi, July 5: The growth in PC sales slowed to 20 per cent in 2004-05 from 32 per cent in 2003-04. The PC market grew by 37 per cent in 2002-03. 

 The over 30 per cent growth recorded for two consecutive years decelerated because of a relatively stagnant second half in 2004-05.

 However, the Internet subscriber base increased by 23 per cent last financial year.

 Vinne Mehta, executive director of MAIT, the apex body of computer hardware manufacturers, said: In the last quarter of 2004-05, there was a sudden dip in sales due to a pre-budget wait by prospective buyers. Moreover, tax and duty structures on PCs were not clear. Normally, January, February and March are crucial months for sales, but the delay in clarification of duty and taxes added to the confusion and sales figures for the year dropped.

 In the six months from April to September 2004, the growth in PC sales was more than 30 per cent. The drop in purchase by the business segment also contributed to lower sales during 2004-05. It is just an aberration. The PC sales will pick up in the current financial year, Mehta added.

 In 2002-03 and 2003-04, the sales growth was fuelled by purchases by the telecom, banking, financial services, manufacturing, retail, BPO and IT industries.

 In 2004-05, about 36.3 lakh desktop PCs were sold in India. According to MAIT, with sound macroeconomic conditions and buoyant buying sentiment in the market, over 42.5 lakh computers are expected to be sold in 2005-06.

 The proportion of assembled PCs, lesser known regional brands and unbranded systems was 41 per cent of total PC sales in 2004-05 compared with 53 per cent in 2003-04.

 The proportion of Indian brands grew from 21 per cent in 2003-04 to 24 per cent, while that of multinational firms from 26 per cent to 35 per cent. The steady drop in prices of branded PCs has resulted in consumers drifting away from assembled non-branded computers, said Mehta.

 PC sales to the business segment improved by 11 per cent, accounting for 72 per cent of the total computer use.

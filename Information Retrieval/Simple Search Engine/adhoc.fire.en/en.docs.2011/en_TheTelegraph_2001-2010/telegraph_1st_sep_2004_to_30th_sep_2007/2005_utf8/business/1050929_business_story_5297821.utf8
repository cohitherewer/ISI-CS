The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Air Sahara in search of cash-rich ally

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Takeoff time

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: Air Sahara is scouting for a private financial investor, who could bring in funds to help buy new aircraft.

 ?We are in talks with Asian and global equity funds ... our choice is a minority financial partner,? said Air Sahara chief executive Rono Dutta in a telephonic conversation with The Telegraph. He said the airline had been valued at between $750 million and $1 billion.

 Dutta rubbished reports that SpiceJet was in talks with Air Sahara to pick up a controlling stake. ?Other airlines have been calling us and are keen to pick up a stake, but we would prefer to take on an equity fund partner,? he said, adding that this did not mean Air Sahara was closed to other options. ?A domestic partner with (airline) alliances with us is also an option, but we prefer a minority shareholder,? he said.

 Aviation circles have been abuzz with stories about how Kingfisher and later SpiceJet were trying to buy out Air Sahara using politicians as intermediaries since July. However, Air Sahara has consistently rubbished these rumours.

 Dutta said the airline was currently concentrating on its talks with the equity funds. He, however, said the discussions had just began and it was premature to say by when any deal would be swung. The problem for most airlines in India is that increased competition has cut revenues and plunged many of them into losses, but things are looking up now with expanding business opportunities.

 Air Sahara has just finalised a five-year business plan, including fleet expansion, drawn up by its advisers Ernst amp; Young and the current exercise to find a financial partner stemmed from it. The fleet acquisition plans will leverage increase in domestic traffic as well as the international routes, which have opened up to it.

 Currently, the airline operates with a fleet of 26 leased aircraft to 25 destinations and offers 123 flights daily to metro and non-metro destinations across the country. Air Sahara says it is ?in an expansion mode and by November will operate 140 flights a day?. 

 It has also signed a series of marketing agreements for code share with the likes of American Airlines. As part of the agreement, American Airlines will launch non-stop daily flights between Delhi and Chicago from November 2005. Air Sahara has also acquired 7 landing slots a week at the Heathrow airport in London and has a marketing pact with British Airways.

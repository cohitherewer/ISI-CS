 Reality check on airlines? overseas plan

 Take-off trauma

 New Delhi, Jan. 22: The government today came out with guidelines on international route allocations to airlines which state that domestic carriers allowed to fly abroad may lose their international rights if they reduce their domestic operations in the future.

 This has been done to ensure that domestic airlines do not merely try to turn into international carriers neglecting their domestic operations, especially flights to remote destinations in the Northeast.

 Among other rules, the government has said Indian carriers would lose the right to fly on a route for two years if they seek and get a route but are unable to fly on it for any reason. 

 This has been done to ensure that there is no ?route squatting? by eligible airlines. However, it also means that airlines like Indian Airlines and Air-India, which are charting a long-drawn aircraft purchase plan, will have to wait till they get their planes in order to seek new rights.

 The guidelines, which were finalised by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, were discussed with top executives from the four airlines now considered eligible to fly abroad ? Air-India, Jet, Sahara and Indian Airlines.

 While A-I has the right to fly all over the globe, Jet and Sahara can fly anywhere but to the Gulf. Indian Airlines, the state-run domestic carrier, can as yet only fly to the Gulf and southeast Asia.

 The four carriers, which have already filed their route allocation demands and their future expansion plans, have now been asked to provide more details to enable the government to process their requests.

 Routes will be allocated to all airlines, except Air-India, as a percentage of flights undertaken in the domestic sector using a formula which takes into account a ratio of the available seat per kilometre flown by an airline.

 A section within the government had wanted routes to be auctioned to the highest bidder, but others felt auctioning might see high bids, which will ultimately never materialise, as happened in the case of telecom licences.

 Notwithstanding these guidelines, the government would have the discretion to permit or deny allocation of rights in view of the preparedness of the airlines and viability of their operations.

 Jet and Air Sahara want to fly to Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, the US and London among other destinations. Both want to fly southeast Asia from this summer and destinations to the west in winter.

 State-run Air-India wants to add Washington, San Francisco and Houston to a huge list of sectors where it holds the rights to fly. The national carrier also wants to increase the number of flights to London and Chicago. Unused sectors where A-I holds the rights and wants to fly in the near future include Sydney, Toronto, Mauritius, Rome and Amsterdam.

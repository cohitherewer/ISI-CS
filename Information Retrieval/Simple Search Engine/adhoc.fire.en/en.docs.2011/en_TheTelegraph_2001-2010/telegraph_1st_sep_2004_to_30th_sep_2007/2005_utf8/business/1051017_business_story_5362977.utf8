 Leash on insurers 

 New Delhi, Oct. 16 (PTI): The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has ordered domestic brokers to immediately terminate illegal deployment of foreign brokers for servicing accounts in India and comply with its regulations.

 It has come to the notice of IRDA that certain foreign brokers, not licensed in India, are entering into arrangements with brokers licensed in India to service their accounts in consideration for a share of the brokerage earned on such account.

 If you have entered into any such arrangements, you are advised to provide full particulars to this office and also to take immediate steps to terminate such arrangement, IRDA said in a directive to the principal officers of licensed brokers.

 Such an arrangement is a clear violation of para 3(b) of the code of conduct under regulation 21 of the IRDA (Insurance Brokers) Regulations, 2002, it said.

 Any broker who has entered into such an arrangement would be committing a breach of para 3 of the code of conduct, the regulator warned.

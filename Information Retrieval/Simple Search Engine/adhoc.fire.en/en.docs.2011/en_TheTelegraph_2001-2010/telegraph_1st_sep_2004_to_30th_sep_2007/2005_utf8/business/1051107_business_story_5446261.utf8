 Iffco lines up Rs 4500cr power unit

 New Delhi, Nov. 6 (PTI): Indian Farmers Fertiliser Co-op Limited (Iffco) has entered into a joint venture with Chhattisgarh State Electricity Board to set up a 1,000-mw power plant in Sarguja district at an investment of Rs 4,500 crore. 

 The shareholders agreement to this effect was signed recently between Iffco managing director US Awasthi and CSEB chairman Rajib Ranjan. 

 Elaborating on the details of the project, Awasthi and Ranjan said the estimated cost of the power project would be Rs 4,500 crore and the financing would be on 70:30 debt-equity pattern. 

 Iffco and CSEB would share the equity in the ratio of 74 per cent and 26 per cent respectively, a joint press statement said, adding the JV company would be known as Iffco-Chhattisgarh Power Ltd (ICPL). 

 The financial closure (arranging financial resources) of the project is targeted to be achieved by the end of next year. The project would start generating power from 2010. CSEB would off-take up to 90 per cent of the power generated from the project. 

 It is a pit-head thermal power project which shall provide livelihood opportunities to the people of under developed area of Sarguja, an ICPL release said. 

 As a part of its expansion programme Vision 2010, Iffco has decided to foray into power generation so as to provide the much-required electricity to farmers, apart from fertiliser and seeds, Awasthi said.

 In September, Iffco had bought the Paradip fertiliser unit of the Abhay Oswal-promoted Oswal Chemicals and Fertilisers Ltd for Rs 2,180 crore. Along with the plant, the deal included the entire Oswal town.

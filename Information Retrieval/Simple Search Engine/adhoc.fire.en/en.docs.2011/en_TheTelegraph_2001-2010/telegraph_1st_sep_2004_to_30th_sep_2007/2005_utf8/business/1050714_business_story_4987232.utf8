The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Maharaja in recast mode

 GARIMA SINGH

 New Delhi, July 13: Maharaja Appliances Limited (MAL), which has locked horns with Electrolux AB over the sale of its Indian operations to Videocon, has decided to enter the white goods segment and restructure existing business. 

 By entering the white goods segment, the kitchen appliances maker will directly compete with Videocons Electrolux range. 

 The tussle between the two groups centres around MAL managing director Harish Kumars demand for a minority 5 per cent stake in Electrolux India.

 In a petition filed before Delhi High Court, Kumar had challenged the changes in the legal structure of Electrolux India. Though Videocon had bought the 91.85 per cent stake of AB Electrolux in EKL, the case is yet to come up for hearing. 

 Kumar said MAL had decided to shut its Gurgaon factory by the end of this year. The company will shift its production line to its plant in Himachal Pradesh.

 At present, the company manufactures appliances such as juicer-mixer-grinder, food processors, steam irons, wet grinder, toasters and electric kettles, washing machine, OTG (oven-toaster-griller) and other assorted products at the Himachal plant.

 On the other hand, the Gurgaon facility largely manufactures ancillary products such as motors and moulders.

 Kumar said by shifting the production line, the company will save a lot on taxes and transportation cost.

 The shifting will be done in a phased manner over a period of six months. Fresh investments to the tune of Rs 5 crore will be made in the Himachal facility in the next one year.

 So far, the Himachal plant, which was set up nearly one-and-half years back, has seen an investment of Rs 20 crore. On the other hand, Rs 10 crore has been invested in the seven-year old plant at Gurgaon.

 Sources say MAL will not sell its Gurgaon plant, as this will subsequently be used for starting a new line of business. The company is evaluating a lot of options, including the production of auto ancillaries or venturing into IT-related services.

 MAL is also planning to set up another factory at the Himachal unit, primarily to manufacture refrigerators and air-conditioners. At present, MAL does not make either of these two products.

 These products will compete with Videocons Electrolux range as also with other major players like Samsung and LG. Sources said the company would also manufacture washing machines and DVDs at the new plant which was expected to be operational by September.

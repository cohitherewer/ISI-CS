 New Delhi, Aug. 25: To make oneself heard in the buzzing mobile market is no kids stuff. But its the kid, in the age group of 7 to 10, that Motorola is targeting to grab a larger slice of the market in India. 

 The Fortune 100 company, which has a 10 per cent share of the local mobile market, will launch phones for children that will have features like call mummy, call dad, call police, call brother/sister. They can also listen to songs and music and play games that have simple features. 

 Officials said it was a new market, which the company was planning to tap but refused to divulge details.

 Commenting on the low market share, Motorola chief Edward J. Zander said, It is a bad feeling. We have lots of work to do. But we dont have to panic, there is a plan in place and we will initiate it in steps. 

 Zander, who was on a three-day visit to the country. vowed a special initiative to improve his companys market share.

 The company is also in an advanced stage of negotiation with the Cellular Operators Association of India to bundle GSM-based mobile phones.

 We have set goals for the next quarter, like launching a phone in October and unveiling a new marketing strategy. We have also brought in a senior and experienced executive, Allen Burnes, to play an important role in the mobile devices business. He has helped us turn around our market share to leadership levels in Russia and Latin American countries, Zander said.

 The company will roll out a slew of new models targeted at the middle and low-end users. 

 Zander said Motorola would focus on connecting the unconnected by launching a sub-Rs 2000 handset by the year-end.

 The company is also eyeing big-ticket tenders for equipment from Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd.

 We are considering it. We need to grow our market share here. We will do everything to comply with the tender conditions of PSU telecom carriers. When and in what shape, size and form, I cant say at this point of time, he said.

 Going gets tough for close-ended ELSS

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Calcutta, Dec. 6: The popularity of close-ended equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS) may fail to match that of open-ended ones.

 The close-ended schemes will have entry and exit restrictions with the funds opening for repurchase once a month, according to a CBDT circular issued on November 3.

 However, an amendment to the circular is expected soon to clear the air regarding equity-linked schemes. The CBDT notification, which had imposed entry and exit restrictions on new ELSS plans, had created confusion among mutual funds and investors alike.

 On November 11, the government clarified that the existing ELSS offered by mutual funds would continue to enjoy tax benefits under section 80 C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

 The government is working on another amendment to the CBDT circular issued on November 3, which will make newly launched open-ended ELSS schemes eligible for tax benefits. Till such time the amendment is issued, fund houses can only launch close-ended schemes, said A.P. Kurien, chairman, Association of Mutual Funds in India.

 We are expecting the amendment any time soon and it will bring about the much-needed clarity in the mutual fund industry regarding ELSS, he added.

 However, close on the heels of the CBDT circular, Tata Mutual Fund has lined up a close-ended ELSS ? the first fund house to do so.

 It has submitted the draft prospectus of Tata ELSS Fund 2005 with the Securities and Exchange Board of India in line with the product specifications mentioned in the circular. According to the prospectus, the fund is a 10-year close-ended ELSS with a lock-in period of 3 years and investments in the scheme up to Rs 1 lakh will be eligible for tax benefit under section 80C.

 Even with the launch of close-ended schemes, Kurien feels open-ended funds will continue to be popular both with the fund houses and investors because of their flexibility. If a fund house launches close-ended funds, it will have to follow it up with a series every year.

 Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research has a similar view. Open-ended schemes will always be favoured over their close-ended counterparts. No prudent investor would be willing to invest in new schemes every year, which does not have any previous performance record, he said.

 Almost all fund houses now have ELSS with the ABN Amro Tax Advantage plan underway and Fidelity waiting on the sidelines. So, whoever launches funds will only do so to attract hot new fund offer money, he added.

 Lenders send payout signal to CESC 

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 House of hope

 Calcutta, June 8: The lenders to CESC will allow the power utility to pay dividend to its shareholders for 2004-05. The lenders include domestic banks, financial institutions and multilateral funding agencies like IFC, ADB, CDC and Kleinworth Benson.

 According to the debt restructuring package okayed by the banks and financial institutions (FIs) in 2003, CESC was barred from paying dividend till March 2006.

 Stock market sources said the company is expected to give dividend in 2004-05 after a gap of almost six years. The last payout by the company was at 20 per cent in 1996-97.

 FI sources said the company had approached the lenders with a dividend proposal in 2004-05. The top brass of the company led by managing director Sumantra Banerjee had apprised the foreign lenders of the financial as well as operational performance of the company.

 An ICICI Bank spokesperson told The Telegraph from Mumbai, CESC had approached us with the request for paying dividends. Since the company had met the parameters in the debt restructuring package we have given them a go-ahead. 

 ICICI Bank is a major lender of CESC and the utility has tied up with the bank to issue co-branded credit cards for the consumers. 

 However, the company officials are tight-lipped about the move. They refused to talk about such a thing at this juncture.

 The Rs 3,300-crore debt restructuring exercise include extending the loan term by three years on an average to match the companys cash flows. There are 33 creditors of the bank. 

 The interest on high-cost loans of the company in the nineties was reduced to 13.5 per cent against 17 to 19 per cent earlier and implementation of a debt repurchase scheme. This had substantially reduced the debt burden of the company.

 CESC was advised by JP Morgan Chase (Hong Kong) and Morrison amp; Foerster (Hong Kong, Singapore, San Francisco and London) on the debt restructuring exercise. 

 Technical analyst Rajat Bose said a dividend from CESC is expected as the performance of the company has improved significantly. The prospects of the company is much better now. In fact, all the RPG companies ? KEC International, Saregama and Harrison Malayalam ? are performing well.

 CESC is also planning to set up a thermal power plant outside Bengal. It is eyeing Jharkhand, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Andhra Pradesh for its new venture. The company maintains that nothing has been firmed up yet. The company has decided to raise $60 million from the domestic as well as the international market to expand its business.

 The CESC share, which was hovering around Rs 17 two years ago, is now at around Rs 211. 

 Bose said power sector stocks are moving up with investors showing greater interest. With the Electricity Act, 2003 in place, the investors find power stocks very exciting.

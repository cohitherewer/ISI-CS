 Alls well with the market

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 29: With the sensex teasing the 9000-mark, finance minister P. Chidambaram today reassured investors that the market was behaving in an orderly manner. 

 I cant keep track of the daily movement of the sensex. But, in my view, the market movements, up or down, are in an orderly manner, Chidambaram told reporters here today.

 What needs to be looked at is the long-term trends of market movement, which is orderly and reflects the fundamentals of the economy, he said.

 Sebi chairman M. Damodaran also feels the movement is orderly, Chidambaram said.

 The sensex opened higher at 9065 against Mondays close of 8994.94. However, it nosedived to a low of 8904.50 within an hour.

 Impressive corporate results and high FII inflows at over $7.5 billion has fuelled the bull run in the equity markets this year. The economy grew 8.1 per cent in the first quarter and the government expects it to grow by over 7 per cent this fiscal.

 Chidambaram added, The rupee-dollar exchange rate movements are also orderly ... the RBI governor has also said so. What needs to be looked at is the real effective exchange rate.

 There has been a slight depreciation in the rupees value against the dollar in recent months and it now stands at 46.86. But the rupee has remained stable against other major currencies like the euro, yen and pound.

 Tax tribunal

 The Congress-led government today brought a bill proposing to set up a national tax tribunal to speed up disposal of tax-related cases.

 Moving the National Tax Tribunal Bill, 2004, Union law minister H.R. Bharadwaj said in the Lower House, Urgent measures are required to speed up taxation matters pending before the high courts.

 The tribunal will hear cases from the income tax appellate tribunal and the customs, excise and service tax appellate tribunals.

 With the establishment of NTT, all matters and proceedings pending in appeals and references under direct tax laws and indirect tax laws before high courts shall stand transferred to it.

 A person who has been a judge of the Supreme Court or Chief Justice of a high court shall be the chairperson of the national tax tribunal.

 There would be at least 15 benches for direct tax matters and 10 for indirect tax matters with each bench having at least two members.

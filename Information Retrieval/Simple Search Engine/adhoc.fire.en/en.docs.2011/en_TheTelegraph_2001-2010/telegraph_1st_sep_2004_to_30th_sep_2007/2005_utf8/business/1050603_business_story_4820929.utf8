 - IT on a roll: Launches, projects, jobs, you have it all

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, June 2: The domestic IT industry has bagged 44 per cent of global outsourcing projects in 2004-05 and is poised to garner more than 50 per cent this fiscal.

 Outsourcing to Indian IT companies boosted software and services exports, which registered a 34.5 per cent growth in 2004-05 at $17.2 billion compared with $12.8 billion in the previous fiscal.

 Technology-enabled services, including back-office units such as call centres, accounted for $5.2 billion. Exports could grow 30 to 32 per cent to $22.5 billion this fiscal.

 The infotech and IT-enabled services (ITeS) industry (including domestic market) garnered revenues of $22 billion in 2004-05, up 32 per cent from $16.7 billion in 2003-04, the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) said.

 Nasscom chairman S. Ramadorai said, The industry is in a strong position to leverage the global software opportunity and establish India as a premier IT destination. The industry has scaled record levels of employment in 2004-05 with the employee base crossing the 1-million mark.

 To sustain our competitive edge, the industry must work with the academia to create the right talent pool, collaborate with the hardware industry in micro-electronics and embedded software, maximise job opportunities and elevate service excellence through R amp;D and quality-benchmarked delivery, he added.

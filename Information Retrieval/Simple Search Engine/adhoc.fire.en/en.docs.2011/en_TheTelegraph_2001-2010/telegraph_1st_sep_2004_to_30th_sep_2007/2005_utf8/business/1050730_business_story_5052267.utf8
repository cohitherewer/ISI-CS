 Govt lowers IFCI holding to 42.5%

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, July 29: The government has reduced its majority holding of 60.08 per cent in IFCI to a minority stake of 42.5 per cent in the last one year. This gains significance in the light of the opposition of Left leaders to equity sales in navratnas and public-sector banks.

 In a letter to CPI leader A. B. Bardhan, Union finance minister P. Chidambaram has stated that he can do little to help merge the ailing development finance institution with IDBI as the government hardly owns it.

 The Left and certain Congress leaders have been trying for some time to revive the financial institution by merging it with IDBI, with which it shares most of its loan portfolio and from which it draws most of its top brass. A delegation of the Left leaders, including Bardhan, CPMs Sitaram Yechury and RSPs Abani Roy, met UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi on this issue earlier this month. She had then promised to consider the proposal.

 IFCI, which was set up under an act of Parliament in 1948, was corporatised in 1993. The government has controlled IFCI through shares held by IDBI as well as holdings kept with a clutch of other state-run financial institutions and the State Bank of India.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who was the finance minister when IFCI was corporatised, told Parliament at that time that the government shareholding would never go below 51 per cent. Directly or indirectly, the government has always held over 60 per cent stake in IFCI.

 However, IDBI, through which the government owned 31.1 per cent of the 60.08 per cent shareholding as on March 31, 2004, quietly started selling the IFCI shares. Around 12.09 per cent stake was sold throughout the year with a major part of it being released after the Congress government took over in May last year.

 The IFCI board, however, still has many government nominees, including additional secretary (banking) Vinod Rai. Moreover, many of the top brass, including chief executive R.M. Malla, are on deputation from IDBI.

 Technically, the sale was needed to convert IDBI into a bank. According to regulations, a bank cannot invest more than 5 per cent of its equity in another financial company. But instead of passing the stake back to either the government or some other state-run institution, IDBI chose to sell it to various private entities.

 The sale drove the share price of the ailing financial institution from around Rs 12 in May last year to over Rs 17 by July this year. This hike attracted attention as normally, a companys shares go up if it does well or if the principal shareholder starts consolidating its position. In case of IFCI, the prices went up even as the financial institution continued to grapple with sticky assets with no new business coming in and the principal shareholder reduced its holdings.

 The stakes of GIC and LIC and the State Bank of India and its subsidiaries, however, have not changed much last financial year.

 IDBIs sale of IFCI shares has turned the government, which as the promoter of the company controls the ailing financial institution through IDBI, into a minority shareholder. In its new balancesheet, IFCI states that it has no promoters any longer.

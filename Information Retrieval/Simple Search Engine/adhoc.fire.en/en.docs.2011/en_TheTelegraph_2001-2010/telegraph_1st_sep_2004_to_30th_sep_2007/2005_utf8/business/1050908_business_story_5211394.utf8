 Google faces the heat

 Seattle, Sept. 7 (Reuters): Attorneys for Microsoft Corporation and Google Incorporated faced off in court on Tuesday over whether an executive familiar with the worlds largest software makers plans in China could begin working for the search engine leader.

 Microsoft has asked King County Superior Court Judge Steven Gonzalez for a preliminary injunction to stop former vice-president Kai-Fu Lee from working for Google ahead of a trial scheduled for January 2006.

 The hearing is Microsofts latest move to stop Lee from working at Google while he is still obligated by the one-year non-compete agreement that came into effect when Lee quit Microsoft in mid-July. Microsoft won a temporary restraining order against Lee and Google in July. 

 Meanwhile, Google, based in Mountain View, California counter-sued in its home state last month to block Microsofts lawsuit.

 Microsoft attorney Jeffrey Johnson argued in the court that Lee, who built Microsofts Beijing research and development centre, has violated a non-compete contract that he signed with Microsoft. He has intimate knowledge of Microsofts operations in China, its competitive strategy against Google and recruiting efforts, pointed out Johnson, adding, Lee should live up to his promise.

 Microsoft played video depositions of Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, chief executive Steve Ballmer and other executives detailing Lees involvement in planning China-related strategies and businesses.

 Microsoft and Google are increasingly becoming the technology industrys most visible competitors, as they face off in the Web search arena and seek to hire top software engineering talent.

 Google said that Lee decided to leave Microsoft and work for Google to head their China operations because he was frustrated with Microsofts lack of action and commitment in China. He tried, but they (Microsoft executives) were completely uninterested in what he had to say about China, said Steve Langdon, a Google spokesman.

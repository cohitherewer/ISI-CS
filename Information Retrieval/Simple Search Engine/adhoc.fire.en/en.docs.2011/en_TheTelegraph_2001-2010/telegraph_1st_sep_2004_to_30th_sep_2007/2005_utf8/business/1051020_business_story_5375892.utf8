 Coke gets Mumbai court breather 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 19: Mumbai High Court today asked the income tax authorities to revoke its order attaching bank accounts of Coca-Cola to recover outstanding tax dues to the tune of Rs 77 crore for the assessment year 2002-2003. On the other hand, the court had directed the soft drink major to deposit Rs 10 crore in three instalments towards the income tax department claim.

 Hearing a petition filed by Coca-Cola, Justice V. C. Daga and Justice J. P. Deodhar, in an oral order, allowed the soft drink major to deposit the amount in three instalments while its appeal was pending before the income tax tribunal against the impugned order of attachment.

 The judges said they would pass a detailed order in their chamber later.

 The income tax authorities had claimed Rs 77 crore dues from Coca-Cola towards ads and promotional expenses incurred by the company during the assessment year 2002-2003. The amount also included an interest amount of Rs 22.3 crore.

 As the soft drink major failed to pay the amount, its accounts with Citibank, Bank of Maharashtra and ABN AMRO and ICICI Bank were attached by the income tax authorities after the assessment officer rejected Coca-Colas plea for a stay on recovery.

 Coca-Cola also moved the income tax tribunal seeking a stay and the matter is pending. 

 As it attached bank accounts of the soft major, the company moved the high court seeking a stay on recovery procedures.

 The income tax department feels that it is standing on a good wicket. Its argument is that a company that essentially makes only concentrates for beverages, cannot include marketing expenses in business expenditure. 

 Coca-Cola, however, refuses to buy this logic. 

 Coca-Cola counsel Soli Dastur argued that the tax department had acted in haste while attaching the bank accounts instead of waiting for the tribunals order on the companys plea to stay the recovery.

 Income tax authorities today filed an affidavit in the court justifying recovery of dues saying the company should first pay the amount and then seek remedy. 

 Counsel for the income tax department Beni Chatterjee argued the amount spent by Coca-Cola on advertisement and promotional activities amounted to business expenditure which was taxable.

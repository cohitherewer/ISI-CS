 RBI plan ready to tackle IMD outflow

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 13: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has arranged for redemption of India Millennium Deposits (IMD) in co-ordination with the State Bank of India .

 According to the arrangement, the entire foreign exchange outgo of $7.3 billion will be met by the central bank by selling its foreign exchange reserves to the State Bank of India (SBI), while the latter will mobilise rupee resources to purchase the foreign exchange from the RBI.

 The RBI is confident the redemption will not affect the money, government securities and foreign exchange markets. 

 Going by the present liquidity conditions in the market, the system should be in a position to take care of the redemption requirements, the RBI added. 

 The eligible market participants can take recourse to the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) amp; second liquidity adjustment facility (SLAF) of the RBI for short-term residual mismatches in the rupee funds position, the apex bank added.

 The IMDs for $5.5 billion, raised in 2000 from non-resident Indians by SBI in dollar, pound sterling and euro, are due for repayment on December 29. 

 The redemption would entail a foreign exchange outgo of about $7.3 billion (principal plus interest). This will be met entirely by the RBI by way of direct sale out of its foreign exchange reserves to SBI at the prevailing market rate. The rupee consideration for this sale, which is likely to be around Rs 33,000 crore, will be paid by SBI. 

 According to the Reserve Bank, the State Bank of India has taken adequate steps to mobilise the rupee resources to purchase foreign exchange from the central bank. Any exchange loss on account of depreciation of the rupee would be shared between the SBI and government. 

 The central bank said both the parties have contributed their respective share in the exchange loss that has accrued during certain years after the launch of IMDs. 

 The contributions are kept with the Reserve Bank in the maintenance of value (MoV) account. 

 The RBI has been assuaging market participants in recent times by saying it perceives no liquidity problem as there are various instruments available to manage liquidity. 

 The RBI expects the experience gathered a couple of years ago during the redemption of Resurgent India Bonds would come handy this time around.

 However, reports say the countrys largest bank may pay relatively less in rupee terms when the IMDs come up for redemption as the Indian currency has appreciated since the bonds were issued in 2000.

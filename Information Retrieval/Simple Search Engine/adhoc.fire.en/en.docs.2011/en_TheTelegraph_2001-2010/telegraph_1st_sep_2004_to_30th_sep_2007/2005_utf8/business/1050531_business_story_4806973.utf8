 Provogue sets band 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 30: Provogue (India) Ltd has fixed a price band of Rs 130-150 per share for its initial public offering (IPO), which will open on June 10 and close on June 16.

 The apparel retailer will offer 40.49 lakh shares through a 100 per cent book-building route, comprising 25 per cent of the fully diluted post-issue equity capital of the company.

 Provogue is promoted by Nikhil Chaturvedi, Salil Chaturvedi, Akhil Chaturvedi, Nigam Patel, Deep Gupta and Rakesh Rawat. The company will utilise the IPO proceeds to expand its branded stores chain, extend existing garment manufacturing facilities and build a new product design and development centre. The funds raised will also enhance working capital requirements.

 The company plans to add 40 small studios and 21 large format stores (Provogue Megastores) to the existing network of 41 Provogue Studio outlets spread across nine cities. 

 The lead managers to the issue are SBI Capital Markets, Karvy Investor Services and Anand Rathi Securities.

 Provogue had earlier roped in actor Fardeen Khan as its brand ambassador. The brand is retailed through select stores in the country apart from its own exclusive outlets. 

 The company was formed by merging Acme Global, Acme Clothing and Acme Hospitality early this year. 

 While its revenues were over Rs 105 crore, the net profit was around Rs 8 crore. Rakesh Jhunjunwala, a BSE broker, had picked a 5 per cent stake in the company. 

 Provogues public offering comes on the back of enthusiastic investor response to recent issues. Last week, Shoppers Stop made a successful debut on the bourses at a premium of 41 per cent to its offer price.

 Net 4 India offer

 Net 4 India Ltd has filed its offer document for public issue with the Sebi. The issue will offer 20,68,200 shares of Rs 10 each for cash at a premium of Rs 10, aggregating Rs 413.64 lakh.

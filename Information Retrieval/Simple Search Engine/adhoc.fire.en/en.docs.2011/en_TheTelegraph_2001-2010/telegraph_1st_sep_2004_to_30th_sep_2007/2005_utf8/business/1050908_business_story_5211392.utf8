 DaimlerChrysler rules out Fiat tieup

 On strong ground

 Frankfurt, Sept. 7 (Reuters): DaimlerChrysler ruled out forming an industrial partnership with Italys Fiat, which said on Tuesday it would announce such a deal with another carmaker before the year-end. That is absolute nonsense, a DaimlerChrysler spokesman said today when asked about speculation that the German-American carmaker could form such an alliance with Fiat.

 Fiat, fighting to emerge from crisis by focusing on its car business, is seeking to share development costs with other automakers on single projects, like a joint venture it has with PSA Peugeot Citroen to make vans.

 We are working to have at least one other alliance by the end of the year, chief executive Sergio Marchionne said at Tuesdays launch of Fiats crucial Punto model.

 The alliance will be industrial, not financial, designed to strengthen our product development, he said.

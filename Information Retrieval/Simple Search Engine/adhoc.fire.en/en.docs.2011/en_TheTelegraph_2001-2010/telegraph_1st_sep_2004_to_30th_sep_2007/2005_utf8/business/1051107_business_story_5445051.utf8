 Calcutta, Nov. 6: US-based Internet protocol network testing solutions company Ixia has commenced operations in the city. The facility in Saltlec is the companys third global software development centre. 

 The other two centres are in California and Romania.

 Ixia already has a sales team operating from Bangalore for the last three years.

 Says Errol Ginsberg, president and CEO of Ixia, The facility will be the local centre for development of software.

 Ixia already has 62 employees engaged in R amp;D in the Calcutta centre and expects to triple the headcount within the next couple of years.

 The $157 million company already has a tie-up with Reliance Infocomm and is into talks with other telecom majors like Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Tata Teleservices.

 The companys chief financial officer, Tom Miller said, The company expected to see a 50-60 per cent growth in sales in India in the next couple of years.

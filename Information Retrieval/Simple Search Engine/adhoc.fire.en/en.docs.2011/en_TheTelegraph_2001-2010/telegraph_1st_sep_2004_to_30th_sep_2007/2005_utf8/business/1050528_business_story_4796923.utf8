 Twin air pacts bring Europe closer

 New Delhi, May 27: India today signed new aviation bilateral agreements with the Netherlands and Belgium allowing up to 42 flights a week between these countries. 

 Both Belgium and the Netherlands have agreed to allow multiple carriers from India, paving the way for flights by Jet and Sahara in addition to the two state-run carriers. 

 At present, Air-India does not fly to either Belgium or the Netherlands, but has plans to start flights to Amsterdam soon. 

 Jet Airways has long been negotiating to fly to the US via Belgium. The airline also has plans to enter into a code share pact with United Airlines which uses Amsterdam as its main European base. 

 Belgium and India have decided to allow designated carriers to mount a total of 21 passenger flights each week and ?unlimited number of frequencies? of freighter carriers to any point of call in each other?s territory.

 Belgian airlines will be allowed to fly to Mumbai and Chennai, while Indian carriers will touch down at Brussels and other airports in the nation, sandwiched between France and Netherlands and Germany. 

 Indian carriers can also operate to ?any one point of choice in Europe as intermediate and/or beyond point, with full fifth freedom rights?. This means they can pick up passengers from Belgium and fly to a third country.

 The two nations have also allowed their designated carriers to enter into code-share arrangements with the airlines of any nationality to operate to points of call beyond. The pact will consequently help Jet Airways, which plans to fly to Europe and the US. 

 The pact with the Netherlands allows Dutch airlines to operate to Hyderabad or Chennai, besides existing rights to fly to Delhi, Calcutta and Mumbai. The two sides also decided to increase the number of weekly frequencies to 21 in a phased manner ? with seven at present to 14 by this October and 21 by next march-April. On these services, no fifth freedom rights would be granted between any point in India, except Calcutta and points in the Gulf and West Asia.

 The designated Dutch carriers can operate to India with any type of aircraft, according to the agreement. The government has already signed a virtual ?open sky? bilateral agreement with the US, substantially expanded it with the UK and other countries, including Germany. This pact is being billed by aviation officials as an extension of the same series.

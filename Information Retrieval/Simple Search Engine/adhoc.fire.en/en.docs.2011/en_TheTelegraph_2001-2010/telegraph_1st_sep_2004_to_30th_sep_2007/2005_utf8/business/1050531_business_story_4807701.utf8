 Price freeze chills IOC net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 30: Indian Oils net profit has dropped 30 per cent to Rs 4,891 crore in 2004-05 from Rs 7,005 crore in the previous fiscal.

 Chairman S. Behuria said the countrys largest oil refiner lost Rs 6,589 crore due to an increased subsidy burden of kerosene and LPG as international crude prices soared. Short-realisations on petrol and diesel also cost the company another Rs 1,188 crore. 

 The IOC board, which met here today, has recommended a final dividend of 100 per cent. The payout amounts to Rs 1,168 crore for 2004-05. The company has already paid an interim dividend of 45 per cent. The total dividend adds up to Rs 1,693 crore. IOC had paid a 210 per cent dividend during the previous year.

 However, the company has recorded a 15.8 per cent jump in turnover at Rs 1,50,677 crore against Rs 130,203 crore in 2003-04. It is Indias first company to scale the Rs 15,000-crore turnover mark, which, however, could not be translated into increased profits.

 The refiners bottomline thinned as it lost Rs 7,777 crore on selling fuel below cost. Following the governments decision not to hike domestic fuel prices despite steep increases in the cost of crude in the global market, IOCs net profit in the last quarter of 2004-05 fell 51 per cent to Rs 893 crore. The company recorded a net profit of Rs 1,850 crore in the last quarter of 2003-04. 

 Indian Oil lost Rs 3,801 crore on selling kerosene and Rs 2,788 crore on selling LPG below cost.

 The loss on petrol amounted to Rs 77 crore, while Rs 1,111 crore was lost on diesel during the last fiscal. In the first two months of the current fiscal, the company has taken a hit of Rs 209 crore on petrol and Rs 1,356 crore on diesel alone.

 The only saving grace was the high refinery margin that enabled its seven refineries to rake in $6.2 per barrel up from $5.3 per barrel in the previous year. 

 The average price of the Indian basket of crude during the year went up to $39.2 per barrel from $28 per barrel in the preceeding year, bringing the oil major under immense financial strain. 

 Behuria said things in the current fiscal turned for the worse with the global crude prices inching up to $48.3 per barrel. 

 Indian Oil has earmarked Rs 7,472 crore for capital investment in refineries, petrochemicals, pipelines and marketing. 

 IOCs chain of petrol pumps has crossed 10,200 outlets and over 1,000 pumps were set up in 2004-05. Another 1,000 such retail outlets will be set up during the current fiscal.

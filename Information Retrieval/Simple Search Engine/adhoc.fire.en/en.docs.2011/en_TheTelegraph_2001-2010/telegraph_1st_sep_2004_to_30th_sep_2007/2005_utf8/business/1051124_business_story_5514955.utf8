 Watch on Ford

 New York, Nov. 23 (Reuters): Moodys Investors Service said on Tuesday it may cut its ratings on Ford Motor Co deeper into junk territory, citing sharply lower demand for the companys trucks and sport utility vehicles.

 Moodys also said it may cut its ratings on Fords finance arm, Ford Motor Credit, to junk status from investment grade. A downgrade to junk territory would eject Ford Credit from the widely followed Lehman Brothers credit index, limiting the investors who can buy its bonds and raising borrowing costs. 

 Ford, the second-largest US automaker, has about $142 billion of consolidated debt, most of it issued by Ford Credit.

 Ford and its rival General Motors Corp have both struggled this year with high labour costs, excess manufacturing capacity and high gasoline prices that cut into sales of their trucks and SUVs.

 Fords shipments of full-size trucks and SUVs plunged by 30 to 40 per cent in September and October, and the shift is expected to continue as buyers look for more fuel-efficient vehicles, Moodys said.

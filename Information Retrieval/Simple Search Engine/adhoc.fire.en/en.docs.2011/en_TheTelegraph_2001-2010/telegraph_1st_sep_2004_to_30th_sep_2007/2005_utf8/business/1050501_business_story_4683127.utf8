 Globalisation index pricks the balloon of ambition

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 30: India 

 reckons it has a rightful place at the high table of the 

 world?s economic giants ? and there was a genuine feeling 

 of pride when the G7 nations invited finance minister P. 

 Chidambaram to their conference in London last year.

 But an AT Kearney study has pricked that balloon of overweening ambition: the study says India figures second from bottom on its globalisation index 2005 (and that?s way below Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka).

 The globalisation index is an empirical measure of globalisation and its impact. It measures economic, person-to-person, political, and technological potential in 62 countries that account for 96 per cent of the world?s gross domestic product and 85 per cent of the global population.

 The 2005 index also explores the relationships between a country?s global integration and its levels of education, political freedom, perceived corruption and susceptibility to terrorism.

 India figures poorly on 11 of 12 parameters to measure the extent of globalisation of the economy.

 The 12 variables are grouped in four categories: economic integration, personal contact, technological connectivity, and political engagement.

 The only area in which India does reasonably well is remittances by expatriates where it is ranked 24 among 62 countries.

 On all others it has fared poorly, including FDI, where it is ranked 51 against Pakistans 36.

 While India and China are seen as economic engines of the world, the globalisation index indicates that there is still a long way for them to go.

 ?The massive population in these countries pose a challenge for the generated wealth to spill over to the broader population in uncharted regions within the countries,? the report states.

 The report also says that more globalised countries tend to be less corrupt and more free; globalisation may be the key to keeping politicians honest as well as helping countries adopt higher international standards of transparency.

 The index also showed that global integration survived the turbulence of the Iraq war, a sharp economic downturn and the failure of trade talks.

 India maintained its standing in the globalisation index even though it continued to dominate the headlines as a popular offshore destination, underscoring the challenges for gains from globalisation to reach large populations.

 However, given the fact that India, Pakistan and Bangladesh together account for one-fifth of the world?s population, the effects of their high performing industries are yet to penetrate regional economies, says the report.

 ?On an aggregate country level, India therefore has struggled to improve its standing on the globalisation index,? states the report.

 In terms of technological connectivity, India continued to have the ninth largest Internet user population in the world: approximately 18.5 million users. By sheer numbers, India rivals Canada, which is considered by American companies as an alternative near-shore destination for service operations.

 Terror slur sparks Jet suit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 NOSING UP

 Mumbai, June 5: Jet Airways today vowed to take swift legal action against the US company that accused it of having links with international terrorist organisations.

 Jet Airways attributed to reports which appeared in a section of the media about an objection filed by an American Company, Jet Airways Inc. with the US Department of Transportation (DOT). Jet Airways, conducted its own investigation and found that the US firm is not a certified airline, does not appear to have made any application to fly in the US, and has no planes registered in its name. 

 Jet Airways is the market leader in Indias civil aviation sector, having overtaken Indian Airlines a couple of years ago. In recent months, it secured government approval to fly to international destinations. It is already touching down at Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Bangkok and London, and will begin a Mumbai-New York flight later this month. 

 The primary motivation of Jet Airways Inc. in filing the objection arises out of a trade name dispute that is already being heard at the US Patent and Trademark Office. 

 Jet Airways Inc. claims first use of the name, from December 1, 2002. The local carrier says it has substantial evidence of using the name in the US since 1995. As such, there are strong grounds for the cancellation of the prior registration by Jet Airways Inc at the US Patent and Trade Office, the domestic airline said. 

 Jet Airways said it was advised that under the US law, such non-use of the name does not entitle Jet Airways Inc to any rights of protection. Jet Airways Inc is thus attempting to block the Indian carriers application only because of its bogus claim to our name. 

 The American Company makes outrageous allegations that the domestic airline has been directly financed since 1991 by some other undesirables. 

 Jet Airways (India) Limited has filed a detailed reply to the objection which, along with its application for operating permit and exemption order, is being processed by and is under consideration of the US transport department.

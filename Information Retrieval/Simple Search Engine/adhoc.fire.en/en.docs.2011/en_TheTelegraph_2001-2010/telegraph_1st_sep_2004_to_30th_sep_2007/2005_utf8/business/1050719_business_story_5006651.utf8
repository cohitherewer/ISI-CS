 Crude import prices surge

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, July 18: The price of the Indian basket of crude imports has skyrocketed to an average of $55.76 per barrel during the first fortnight of this month.

 This represents a $6 increase from $49.88 per barrel that the country had to pay for imports during the April-June period.

 The average price of crude imports in 2004-05 was $38.25 per barrel, which had caused the profits of downstream oil companies to plummet. With prices heading north, the oil companies are headed for worse days.

 An Indian Oil official told The Telegraph that the under-recoveries on diesel and petrol had gone up to Rs 5.50 per litre and Rs 2.40 per litre, respectively, since their price revision last month. 

 The government had raised the price of petrol by Rs 2.50 per litre and that of diesel by Rs 2 per litre to save the public sector oil companies from plunging into the red. The prices of cooking gas and kerosene were left unchanged.

 While hiking the prices, Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar had said only half the increase in international prices had been passed on to consumers and the other half will be borne by the public sector oil companies.

 The Left parties had announced nationwide protests, putting the government on the defensive.

 The tax structure introduced in the current budget has only made things worse for the oil companies.

 The government is desperately looking for ways to prevent the oil companies from plunging into the red during the first quarter. 

 Apart from ONGC, OIL and Gail, it has decided to rope in stand-alone refineries such as MRPL, Chennai Petroleum Corporation and Kochi Refineries to reimburse the losses of Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum and IBP on the sale of essential petroleum products.

 Petroleum secretary S. C. Tripathi feels IOC may scrape through to a marginal profit for the first quarter while the other oil marketing companies will still end up in the red after the reimbursements.

 However, with no improvement in the international oil prices, the scenario for the second quarter looks gloomier.

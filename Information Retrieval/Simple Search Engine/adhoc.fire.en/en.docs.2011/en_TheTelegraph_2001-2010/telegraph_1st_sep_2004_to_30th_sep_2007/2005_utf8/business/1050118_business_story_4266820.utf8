The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 HPL door opened to Indian Oil

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Welcome note 

 Calcutta, Jan. 17: The principal promoters of Haldia Petrochemicals ? The Chatterjee Group and the Bengal government ? have cleared Indian Oil?s entry into the company.

 The proposal, approved at an extraordinary general meeting on Saturday, envisages an investment of Rs 150 crore in return for a 7.5 per cent stake. IOC cleared the plan in October.

 HPL promoters will now put their heads together to decide on the timing of a long-planned initial public offering (IPO), which has already been blessed by the board. Around 30 crore shares are being put on the block.

 ?The HPL board will meet soon to take a final call on the timing of the proposed offer,? senior HPL officials said. Kotak Mahindra Bank, DSP Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan have been picked as lead managers to the book-built issue.

 The Bengal government is optimistic that IOC?s entry will bring fresh funds from the public-sector oil major to the state. ?The government has always preferred IOC as the fourth strategic partner. It has years of experience in petroleum. This will help HPL grow,? senior officials of the state commerce and industry department said.

 The entry of IOC, which will have a director on the HPL board, is being seen as a step forward in its own integration process. Having lorded over petroleum retail and crude refining for years, the Fortune 500 major has long been looking to get a toehold in petrochemicals.

 Indian Oil could help in any expansion of HPL?s manufacturing capacity. Bengal will gain if IOC sets up more downstream facilities close to its refinery in Haldia. The PSU has promised a chemical park in the port town as part of plans to turn it into eastern India?s petrochemicals hub.

 IOC had earlier proposed an investment of Rs 5,700 crore in Bengal ?Rs 700 crore in HPL and Rs 5,000 crore in a synthetic rubber plant and other petrochem-related units.

 HPL insiders say Mani Shankar Aiyar facilitated the entry of Indian Oil. The petroleum minister had promised Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee that he would clear the oil major?s way to Haldia Petrochem. 

 ?We will soon inform the corporate debt-restructuring cell of our decision on Indian Oil,? HPL officials said.

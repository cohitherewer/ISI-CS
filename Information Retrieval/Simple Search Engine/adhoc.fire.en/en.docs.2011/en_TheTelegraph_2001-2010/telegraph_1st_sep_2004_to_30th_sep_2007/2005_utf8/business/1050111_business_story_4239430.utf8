 Ford to up spend on brand campaign

 - Road ahead: Some plan big, others stick to the track

 Detroit, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Ford Motor Co plans to increase its advertising spending by about 15 per cent this year to promote its flagship Ford-brand vehicles, including the new mid-size Fusion sedan that will be in dealerships in the fall. 

 Ford division president Steve Lyons told reporters on Sunday at the North American International Auto Show that Ford brand advertising spending rose to a record high last year, although he declined to reveal the size of the budget. 

 ?We are increasing our advertising budget very substantially this year ... adding $50 million to $100 million,? Lyons said. 

 ?The increase will amount to a year-on-year rise in the 15 per cent range,? Lyons said. 

 Ford, the second-largest US automaker, spent more than $150 million in fourth-quarter advertising to promote its large Five Hundred sedan, Freestyle wagon and other new or redesigned vehicles. 

 Ford had proclaimed 2004 as the ?year of the car? when it hoped new models like its Mustang sports car would boost results. The company, however, reported a 3.6 percent drop in sales for December.

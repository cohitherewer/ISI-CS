 Honda in cheap-car scurry

 Tokyo, April 4 (Reuters): Since it began knocking together motorbikes at the end of the Second World War, Honda Motor Co has striven to keep pace with bigger and wealthier auto makers by its creativity and focus on innovative technology. 

 Now, more than ever, Japan?s number-three car maker says a renewed drive to bring its research and development and production operations closer together are crucial to thriving in an industry where the race to develop unique and fuel-efficient cars has intensified. 

 ?We?re at a critical juncture where we have to really fortify the link between R amp;D and production,? said Motoatsu Shiraishi, a senior executive who took over Hondas R amp;D unit last Friday. 

 ?For example, when hybrid and fuel-cell cars become more common, it won?t be enough to come up with a better product at the research level. We have to make it commercially viable when its mass-produced,? he said in a recent interview. 

 On the research front, Honda, ranked eighth in the world in car sales volume, is well ahead of the pack. 

 In 1999, the maker of the popular Accord saloon released the US market?s first gasoline-electric hybrid car; most rivals have yet to offer one. It is also alone with a marketable fuel-cell vehicle that can be driven in freezing temperatures. 

 But as rivals gear up to bring their next-generation cars to market, Honda expects to face heightened competition. While most of its peers have formed capital and technical ties to speed up development, Honda has, typically, chosen to go it alone. 

 That independence means Honda cant reap the kind of cost savings that Nissan Motor Co Ltd enjoys by buying common parts with partner Renault to take on General Motors Corp, Toyota Motor Corp and others. 

 ?We are small and weak when it comes to scale. A company like ours has to compete by staying one step ahead of the rest in the field of technology,? Shiraishi said, stressing that a closer link between R amp;D and production was a must.

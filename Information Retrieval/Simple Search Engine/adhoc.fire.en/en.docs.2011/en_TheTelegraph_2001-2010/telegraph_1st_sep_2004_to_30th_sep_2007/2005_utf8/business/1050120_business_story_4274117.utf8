 Calcutta, Jan. 19: TCL amp; Alcatel Mobile Phones (TAMP) plans to introduce a range of high-end GSM and CDMA mobile phones in India in August.

 The joint venture between French company Alcatel and China?s TCL Communication has identified India as a key market for mobile phones. TAMP, formed with an initial net asset of 100 million euros, is based in Hong Kong. TCL holds a 55 per cent stake while the remaining is with Alcatel.

 Dinesh Kumar, country manager, India amp; Bangladesh, TAMP, said, ?We expect to sell 9 lakh GSM phones in India by December. For CDMA phones, we have not yet set a target.?

 At present, mobile phones comprise a mere 2 per cent of the company?s Rs 1000-crore revenue from its Indian operations. ?We plan to increase the revenue share from the mobile phone business to 6 per cent by the end of the year,? said Kumar. ?In the east, we have a 4 per cent market share, but plan to take this to 15 per cent in the first six months of operations.?

 TAMP has outlined an investment of $2 million for marketing and promotional activities in India.

 The company has initially launched four models and another five will be introduced in the first quarter of 2005.

 ?We have a four-pronged strategy that will focus primarily on building a strong brand equity for Alcatel across the country,? said Kumar. ?A strong distributor network based on local needs, customisation of phones and compatibility with Indian languages are some of the other areas of focus,? he added.

 TAMP is also into negotiations with CDMA operators and expect to finalise a deal by June with Tata Indicom.

 The phones will be procured from the company?s manufacturing facility in China, which caters to the requirements in the Asia-Pacific region and has a capacity of 5 million units per annum. The company has two other manufacturing facilities in Mexico and France.

 India Inc ready with budget wishlist 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 8: With four months still to go for the Union Budget 2006-07, the Indian industries have already chalked out their proposals.

 Companies are seeking an increase in the depreciation rates on plant and machinery to 25 per cent from 15 per cent at present. They are also rooting for a hike in their additional depreciation charges from the existing 10 per cent to 20 per cent. 

 Anil K. Agarwal, president, Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham), said, In view of the chamber, lower depreciation rates will adversely affect the capital formation for further investment in new plant and machinery. Therefore, a hike in the rates is needed.

 The chamber has put forward this proposal in its pre-budget memorandum submitted recently to the finance ministry. The depreciation rates for general plant and machinery were reduced from 25 per cent to 15 per cent in the Finance Act 2005.

 In this years Union Budget, additional depreciation under section 32(1) (iia) of the Income Tax Act had been increased from 15 per cent to 20 per cent in respect of plant and machinery installed after March 31, 2005. However, where the plant and machinery is put to use for less than 180 days in a year, second provision of section 32 (1) restricts the additional depreciation to 50 per cent.

 The chamber has suggested that depreciation allowance on passenger cars should be increased to 33.3 per cent as the product cycle is becoming shorter and the prices of used vehicles have crashed.

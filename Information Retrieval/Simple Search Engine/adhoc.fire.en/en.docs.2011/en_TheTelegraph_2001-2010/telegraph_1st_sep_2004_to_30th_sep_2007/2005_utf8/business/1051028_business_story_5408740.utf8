 Bill to remove cess on farm exports 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 27: The cabinet today approved a bill to remove cess on farm exports to make them globally competitive.

 The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) also set the ball rolling for the public-private partnership appraisal committee (PPAC) on the lines of the public investment board (PIB). A decision on a special purpose vehicle for funding infrastructure projects has, however, been deferred till the next meeting.

 The cess removal move will take effect through a bill to repeal the Agricultural Produce Cess Act 1940 and the Produce Cess Act, 1966 .

 This (decision) will make our exports more competitive. We cannot subsidise exports like the developed countries do, but let us not tax them, commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath said.

 The cess is a tax on exports. Officials said in the present national and international context, it is bad economics to tax exports. A cess would only make the exports more expensive and noncompetitive. Agricultural exports form a significant proportion of Indias total exports and there still remains a vast untapped potential for exports from the agri sector, an official said.

 The cabinet had earlier approved the repeal of various cess acts related to commodities such as the Spices Cess Act, 1986, the Coffee Act, 1942, and the Tobacco Cess Act, 1975.

 The public-private partnership panel, which got the go-ahead today, will appraise projects where the capital cost or the cost of underlying assets exceeds Rs 100 crore. Once these are cleared, they would go to the competent authority for final approval.

 In case of departures from the model concession agreement, which are not material or substantive, such departures will be cleared by the PPAC, with the approval of the finance minister, an official statement said.

 The PPAC would be headed by the secretary, department of economic affairs. The other members of the committee would be secretary (Planning Commission), expenditure secretary, secretary (legal affairs) and the secretary of the department pertaining to the particular project. According to the procedure approved by the CCEA, the ministry concerned will develop individual proposals using legal, financial and technical consultants and also avail of the benefits of an inter-ministerial group, if necessary. 

 For projects with capital costs less than Rs 100 crore, the economic affairs department would issue detailed guidelines for appraisal of concession agreements.

 Crude fuels ONGC net spurt

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Raha: Growth drive

 New Delhi, April 20: ONGC has clocked a net profit of Rs 9,611 crore for the financial year ended March 31. The company had posted a 43 per cent increase in its turnover to touch Rs 47,025 crore for the year. 

 ONGC had to give Rs 3,114 crore to the downstream oil marketing companies ? Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum ? as its share of the subsidy burden on LPG and kerosene. If this transfer is excluded, the net profit of ONGC works out to Rs 12,725 crore. The company had made a Rs 8,664-crore net profit during 2003-04. 

 The increase in earnings has been essentially due to the higher crude prices during the year compared with the previous year. The average price difference for the two years works out to over $10 per barrel. 

 In physical terms, the ONGC crude output during 2004-05 was 26.487 million tonnes, which represents a less than 2 per cent increase over the 2003-04 output of 26.057 million tonnes. However, the company has reported a natural decline of 6 to 8 per cent in its ageing fields.

 ONGC?s gas output declined to 22.971 billion cubic metres (BCM) from 23.584 BCM in the previous year. 

 The decline in gas production from the ageing Vasai field lead to a drop in the output of finished products to 3.34 million tonnes compared with 3.63 million tonnes in the preceding year.

 Both the oil and oil equivalent gas produced by ONGC worked out to 1 million barrels per day.

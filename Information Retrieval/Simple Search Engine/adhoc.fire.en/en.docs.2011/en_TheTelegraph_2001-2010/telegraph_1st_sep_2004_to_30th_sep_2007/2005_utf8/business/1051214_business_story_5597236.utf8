 New Delhi, Dec. 13: Skoda Auto India, the subsidiary of the German Volkswagen group, will raise the price of its cars by up to Rs 30,000 from January.

 The prices of 12 models from Skoda Auto India will go up by Rs 15,000-30,000 mainly because of increased freight costs, Skoda Auto India managing director Imran Hassen said.

 The carmaker today launched the Laura in the upper premium luxury class segment, which is made on the bigger A5 platform.

 Hassen, however, said the hike would not be applicable to the Laura, which comes with a price tag of Rs 16,81,081 (ex-showroom Delhi).

 It is a completely new car with progressive technologies and a number of sophisticated elements that have so far been used only in the upper premium luxury-class segment, Hassen added.

 This latest model is powered by a 1896-cc diesel engine.

 In the beginning of this year, Skoda launched the Laura in Europe where it sells as Octavia II.

 According to him, despite the planned price hike, the companys products will remain competitive in their respective categories.

 The company plans to launch two versions of its Octavia range ? one in January and the other in March 2006.

 We will continue to bring in new technologies and introduce new products, he said.

 Skoda is looking at selling about 4,000 units of the Laura in the next 12 months.

 In its four years of operations in India, Skoda has sold 25,000 cars and enjoys a 25 per cent market share in its segment, he said, adding that the company would try to increase the share with a series of launches next year.

 A couple of months back, Skoda Auto India launched the Skoda Octavia Combi followed by the diesel variant of its Superb model last month.

 Last month, the auto maker also commissioned its expanded assembly line at Aurangabad in Maharashtra. The assembly line, which is the first plant of Skoda Auto outside Europe, doubled its production capacity to 30,000 units. According to sources, the new assembly line was meant to enable Skoda Auto India to launch other models from its parents stable.

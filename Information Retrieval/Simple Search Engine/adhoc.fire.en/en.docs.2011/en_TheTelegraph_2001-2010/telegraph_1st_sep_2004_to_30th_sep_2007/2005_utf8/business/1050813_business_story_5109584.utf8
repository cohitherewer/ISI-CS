 Car sales skid

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 12: Passenger car sales slipped for the second month in a row in July and for the third time in the last six months. It dropped 10.6 per cent to 63,084 cars compared with 70,606 in July 2004.

 Sales had dropped 4.2 per cent to 62,072 units in February and 0.89 per cent to 64,464 units in June. 

 One needs to understand whether this will continue or is a temporary phenomenon, because of the twin factors working in the market since April. These are the introduction of the value-added tax and implementation of new emission norms, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) said.

 Analysts also blamed the recent floods in Maharashtra, which brought business to a grinding halt. The western Indian state is a big market for automobiles. 

 According to figures released by the SIAM, eight of the 11 carmakers, including Maruti Udyog, Hyundai Motor and Tata Motors, have reported a decline in sales. 

 For the April to July period, however, car sales increased 4.69 per cent to 3,38,424 units compared with 3,23,276 a year ago. 

 Two-wheeler sales, too, dropped 2.5 per cent in July to 4,83,090 units against 4,95,456 units in the same period last year.

 Drug firms on bird flu alert

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 15: Drug companies have geared up to handle a possible bird-flu outbreak. Industry experts have urged the authorities to either issue a compulsory licence that will allow local pharmaceutical companies to make generic versions of Tamiflu, the Roche-Gilead product, or import it from the overseas company.

 At present, Indian companies like Ranbaxy Laboratories, Cipla and Hetero Drugs are keen to make generic versions of the patented drug. Cipla is understood to have approached Roche for permission to manufacture the drug. Roche is yet to respond and a disaster could hit India with no palliative against the disease.

 According to D.G. Shah, secretary-general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, while pre-planning for a possible pandemic is crucial, the key to a contingency plan is making medicines available and that poses another peculiar problem for India. 

 Tamiflu from Roche-Gilead and Relenza from GlaxoSmithKline appear quite effective in mitigating the effects of bird flu. But with the Tamiflu patent pending in India, the government is yet to decide how to make the drug in the country, he told reporters at a meeting of the Ficci National Pharmaceutical Committee here today. 

 Shah lamented the fact that the government had not taken any concrete measures to tackle bird flu if it hits the country. Shah said there are various options before the government, the first being import of the drug from Roche. 

 The second way is to use Section 84 of the Indian Patents Act, which allows an Indian company to approach the innovator (Roche-Gilead in this case) for permission to make the drug.

 The innovator has to respond within a reasonable time-frame. If it does not do so within this period, the patent office can then ask the domestic firm to make the drug. However, the principal drawback of using this route is that it could lead to injunctions.

 Shah said to avoid the legal hurdle, the government can use the compulsory licensing route or Section 92 of the Indian Patent Act. 

 The authorities can ask local generic companies to make the drug in the event of a health emergency.

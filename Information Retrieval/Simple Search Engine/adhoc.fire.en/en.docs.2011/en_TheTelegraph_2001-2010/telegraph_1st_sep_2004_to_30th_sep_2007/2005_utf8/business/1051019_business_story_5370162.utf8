 Tata Power net profit down to Rs 125 cr

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 18: Tata Power Company Ltd has reported a lower net profit at Rs 125.67 crore for the quarter ended September 30 against Rs 141.89 crore during the same period last fiscal.

 Total income increased to Rs 1103.67 crore from Rs 1039.12 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal, the Tata group company has informed the Bombay Stock Exchange today. The company said the results are not comparable because of sale of its two units with effect from July 1, 2004.

 The company had sold its 75-mw power plant at Wadi to Associated Cement Companies Ltd and the broadband division to Tata Power Broadband Company Ltd. 

 The results for the quarter ended September 30, 2005, do not include the results from the operations of Wadi Power Plant and of the broadband business.

 The results during the quarter signify sustained volume growth on the back of increased demand in the licence area. Enhanced use of the companys hydel generating capacity ensured that the balance between hydel and thermal generation was suitably optimised, thus reducing the impact of rising fuel costs on the consumer, A.J. Engineer, head of the company, said.

 Texmaco earnings 

 Texmaco, a K K Birla group company, has posted a net profit of Rs 4.99 crore in the second quarter against Rs 3.29 crore in the same period last year. Total income rose to Rs 87.35 crore against Rs 62.51 crore in the second quarter of last year. The companys performance is noteworthy considering that the wagon orders for the current year are yet to be released by Indian Railways.

 UTI Mutual plan triggers concern

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 6: The plan to hand over UTI Mutual Fund to the State Bank of India (SBI) has sparked concerns that the move will provide Societe Generale a backdoor entry.

 Several questions are being raised on the sale. Industry sources say the due diligence exercise was based on the valuation of UTI MF on January 31, 2003, when the mutual funds corpus was Rs 13,800 crore. The assets under management now stand at over Rs 22,000 crore.

 There are worries about a a conflict of interest if SBI succeeds in acquiring the mutual fund from its three partners ? Life Insurance Corporation, Punjab National Bank and Bank of Baroda. The conflict arises because Societe Generale holds 37 per cent in the equity of SBI-MF, which manages funds to the tune of over Rs 7200 crore. Even Punjab National bank has Principal as foreign partner, a factor that should put it out of contention.

 UTI officials say a lot has changed at the premier fund since the government bailed it out with a package for investors of US-64. It has recovered from a crisis triggered by the poor performance of its flagship scheme. 

 A fresh due diligence exercise is being undertaken under which UTI MFs goodwill and performance will be measured. The rise in assets has helped the fund strengthen its leadership in an industry witnessing the entry of several new foreign players with Indian partners.

 The exercise has to take several factors into account, including issues like penetration and quality of manpower and size of the organisation, a senior UTI official said.

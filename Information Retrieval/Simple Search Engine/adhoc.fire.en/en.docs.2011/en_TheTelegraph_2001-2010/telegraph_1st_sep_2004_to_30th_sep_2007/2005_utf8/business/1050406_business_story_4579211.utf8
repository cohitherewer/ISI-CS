 Tourism ministry mulls crisis cell

 GARIMA SINGH

 New Delhi, April 5: After the scare of another tsunami in the South Asian region triggered by a large earthquake off Sumatra a couple of weeks ago, the tourism ministry has announced plans to set up a crisis management cell.

 The structure of the cell was discussed at a meeting of the ministry?s advisory board that was held earlier this week. Industry will also be asked to submit its suggestions in this regard.

 The cell is likely to be constituted in a month. Although the main task of the cell will be to assist tourists in times of crises, it will also look into other issues that affect tourism.

 ?The idea of the cell is a good initiative taken in the spirit of public-private partnership. Tourism can only grow if ideas and suggestions of the stakeholders are taken into account,? said Ashwini Kakkar, managing director of Thomas Cook India.

 Senior officials from industry associations like the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) were present at the meeting of the advisory board.

 Members from tourism bodies like the Hotel Association of India, the Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association of India and the Travel Agents Association of India also participated in the meeting.

 The ministry is planning a model where the cell will also be able to check the ?crisis? due to degeneration of places of tourist interest like the Bharatpur bird sanctuary and Himalayan hill stations.

 ?A case in point is the Sariska tiger sanctuary, which we have been promoting through the Incredible India campaign, but tourists? interest there is waning because of the dwindling number of tigers,? said Union tourism minister Renuka Chowdhury.

 Chowdhury said the next phase of the campaign will focus on the domestic traveller. 

 Initially, the domestic campaign was test marketed in seven states. It will now be launched throughout the country using funds from the Rs 70 crore corpus earmarked by the ministry for tourism promotion.

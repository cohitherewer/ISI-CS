The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Q amp;A

 I have taken a home loan and my EMI is deducted from my salary account. Can I switch to a new job or become a self-employed professional?

 Debashish Saha, Calcutta

 You can switch jobs or opt for self-employment during the course of your loan. However, you have to keep the housing finance company informed about the same and submit necessary documents confirming your move. If your repayment happens by way of deduction against salary, you have to get this deduction from your new employer or alternatively give post-dated cheques for the EMIs.

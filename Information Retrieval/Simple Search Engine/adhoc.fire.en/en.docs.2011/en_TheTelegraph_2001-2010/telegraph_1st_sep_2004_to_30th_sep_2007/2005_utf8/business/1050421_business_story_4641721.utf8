The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Purnendu to get six months on HPL

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Chatterjee: Deadline pressure

 Calcutta, April 20: The Bengal government will give Purnendu Chatterjee six months to sign a pact for buying its 36 per cent stake in Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) ? a proposition that will set him back by Rs 1,560 crore.

 Writers? Buildings sources said the new agreement to be signed with Chatterjee will have a clause that will give the government the right to offer its shares to others if The Chatterjee Group boss does not respond to the offer.

 Inserting a provision like this in the agreement will make it easier for the state government to invite Indian Oil Corporation, the navratna oil PSU keen to invest in HPL. 

 The agreements that the state government signed with Purnendu in 2002 and 2004 ? before the corporate debt restructuring of the petrochem firm ? did not give it the freedom to sell out to other companies ready to enter HPL.

 The government is also contemplating a penalty clause, which could be invoked if Chatterjee fails to bring money on time.

 The TCG chief is yet to sign a pact with the Bengal government and is still in negotiations on the share price. If he signs on the dotted line and pumps in the money, he will become the single-largest shareholder of the Rs 5,170-crore HPL ? and wield management control.

 At present, TCG holds 43 per cent in HPL?s Rs 1410-crore equity. The Bengal government has proposed that Chatterjee buy its 36 per cent stake. The share price has been fixed by the government in consultation with L.B. Jha amp; Company, its adviser on the petrochem company.

 Chatterjee will have to fork out Rs 1560 crore, at the rate of Rs 30 per share ? a premium of Rs 20. At a face value of Rs 10 a share, the government?s stake is worth Rs 520 crore. Add the premium and Chatterjee?s purchase price will be three times. 

 It is not known if he can raise that kind of money. In the past, he has had trouble meeting his financial commitment.

 Writers? Buildings sources say Chatterjee has already raised questions on the share price. He is willing to clinch the deal at par or pay a premium of Rs 2. He feels that a price of Rs 30 per share is too high for a company which has just turned around and is booking profits. HPL expects a net profit of around Rs 750 crore for 2004-05.

 Chatterjee has been insisting on gaining full control, arguing that the company should not fall into the hands of public sector. Now, he has to either cough up this amount or lose control of HPL.

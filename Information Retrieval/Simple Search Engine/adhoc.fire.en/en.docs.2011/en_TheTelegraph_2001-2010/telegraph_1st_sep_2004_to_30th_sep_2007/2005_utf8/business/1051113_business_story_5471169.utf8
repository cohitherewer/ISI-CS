The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 The End of Economic Man

 BARNABY J. FEDER 

 Peter Drucker (1909-2005)

 California, Nov. 12: Peter 

 F. Drucker, the political economist and author, thought 

 of himself, first and foremost, as a writer and teacher, 

 though he eventually settled on the term social ecologist. 

 His view that big business and 

 non-profit enterprises were the defining innovation of the 

 20th century led him to pioneering social and management 

 theories. 

 He became internationally renowned 

 for urging corporate leaders to agree with subordinates 

 on objectives and goals and then get out of the way of decisions 

 about how to achieve them.

 He challenged both business and 

 labour leaders to search for ways to give workers more control 

 over their work environment. He also argued that governments 

 should turn many functions over to private enterprises and 

 urged organising in teams to exploit the rise of a technology-astute 

 class of knowledge workers.

 Drucker staunchly defended the 

 need for businesses to be profitable but he preached that 

 employees were a resource, not a cost. His constant focus 

 on the human impact of management decisions did not always 

 appeal to executives, but they could not help noticing how 

 it helped him foresee many major trends in business and 

 politics. 

 He began talking about such practices 

 in the 1940s and 50s, decades before they became 

 so widespread that they were taken for common sense. Drucker 

 also foresaw that the 1970s would be a decade of inflation, 

 that Japanese manufacturers would become major competitors 

 for the United States and that union power would decline.

 For all his insights, he clearly 

 owed much of his impact to his extraordinary energy and 

 skills as a communicator. But while Drucker loved dazzling 

 audiences with his wit and wisdom, his goal was not to be 

 known as an oracle.

 His first book ? The End of 

 Economic Man, 1939 ? was intended to strengthen the 

 will of the free world to fight fascism. His later economic 

 and social predictions were intended to encourage businesses 

 and social groups to organise in ways that he felt would 

 promote human dignity and vaccinate society against political 

 and economic chaos.

 Drucker, who was born in Vienna 

 and never completely shed his Austrian accent, worked in 

 Germany as a reporter until Hitler rose to power and then 

 in a London investment firm before emigrating to the United 

 States in 1937. He became an American citizen in 1943. 

 Recalling the disasters that overran 

 the Europe of his youth and watching the American response 

 left him convinced that good managers were the true heroes 

 of the century.

 Drucker never hesitated to make 

 suggestions he knew would be viewed as radical. He advocated 

 legalisation of drugs and stimulating innovation by permitting 

 new ventures to charge the government for the cost of regulations 

 and paperwork. He was not surprised that General Motors 

 for years ignored nearly every recommendation in The 

 Concept of the Corporation, the book he published in 

 1946 after an 18-month study of GM that its own executives 

 had commissioned. 

 From his early 20s to his 

 death, Drucker held various teaching posts, including a 

 20-year stint at the Stern School of Management at the New 

 York University and, since 1971, a chair at the Claremont 

 Graduate School of Management. He also consulted widely, 

 devoting several days to such work even in his 90s. 

 His clients included GM, General Electric and Sears, Roebuck 

 but also the Archdiocese of New York and several Protestant 

 churches; government agencies in the United States, Canada 

 and Japan; universities; and entrepreneurs. 

 Druckers greatest impact 

 came from his writing. His more than 30 books, which have 

 sold tens of millions of copies in more than 30 languages, 

 came on top of thousands of articles, including a monthly 

 op-ed column in The Wall Street Journal from 1975 

 to 1995. 

 Druckers thirst for new 

 experiences never waned. He became so fascinated with Japanese 

 art during his trips to Japan after World War II that he 

 eventually helped write Adventures of the Brush: Japanese 

 Paintings (1979), and lectured on Oriental art at Pomona 

 College in Claremont from 1975 to 1985.

 Peter Ferdinand Drucker was born 

 November 19, 1909, one of two sons of Caroline and Adolph 

 Drucker, a prominent lawyer and high-ranking civil servant 

 in the Austro-Hungarian government. He left Vienna in 1927 

 to work for an export firm in Hamburg, Germany, and to study 

 law. 

 Drucker then moved to Frankfurt, 

 where he earned a doctorate in international and public 

 law in 1931 from the University of Frankfurt, became a reporter 

 and then senior editor-in-charge of financial and foreign 

 news at the newspaper General-Anzeiger. While teaching at 

 the university, he met Doris Schmitz, a 19-year-old student. 

 They became reacquainted after waving madly while passing 

 each other going opposite directions on a London subway 

 escalator in 1933 and were married in 1937.

 Drucker had moved to England to 

 work as a securities analyst and writer after watching the 

 rise of the Nazis with increasing alarm. In England, he 

 took an economics course from John Maynard Keynes in Cambridge, 

 but was put off by how much the talk centred on commodities 

 rather than people.

 Druckers reputation as a 

 political economist was firmly established with the publication 

 in 1939 of The End of Economic Man. The New York 

 Times said it brought a remarkable vision and 

 freshness to the understanding of fascism. The books 

 observations, along with those in articles he wrote for 

 Harpers and The New Republic, caught the eye of policy makers 

 in the federal government and at corporations as the country 

 prepared for war, and landed him teaching at Sarah Lawrence 

 College in Bronxville, New York. 

 Writing The Future of Industrial 

 Man, published in 1942 after Drucker moved to Bennington 

 College in Vermont, convinced him that he needed to understand 

 big organisations from the inside. Rebuffed in his requests 

 to work with several major companies, he was delighted when 

 General Motors called in late 1943 proposing that he study 

 its structure and policies. To avoid having him treated 

 like a management spy, GM agreed to let him publish his 

 findings.

 Neither GM nor Drucker expected 

 the public to be interested because no one had ever written 

 such a management profile, but The Concept of the Corporation 

 became an overnight sensation when it was published in 1946. 

 The Concept of the Corporation is a book about business 

 the way Moby Dick is a book about whaling, 

 said Beatty, referring to the focus on social issues extending 

 far beyond GMs immediate operating challenges.

 In it, Drucker argued that profitability 

 was crucial to a businesss health but more importantly 

 to full employment. Management could achieve sustainable 

 profits only by treating employees like valuable resources. 

 That, he argued, required decentralising the power to make 

 decisions, including giving hourly workers more control 

 over factory life, and guaranteed wages.

 In the 1950s, Drucker began 

 proclaiming that democratic governments had become too big 

 to function effectively. This, he said, was a threat to 

 the freedom of their citizens and to their economic well 

 being.

 Unlike many conservative thinkers, 

 Drucker wanted to keep government regulation over areas 

 like food and drugs and finance.

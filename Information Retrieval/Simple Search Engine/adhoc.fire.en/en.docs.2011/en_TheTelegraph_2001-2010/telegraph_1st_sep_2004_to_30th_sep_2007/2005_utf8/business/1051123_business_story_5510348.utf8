 Calcutta, Nov. 22: Australia has rolled out the red carpet for Indian companies keen on developing coal mines in that country.

 Australia has a vast reservoir of high-quality coking coal ? a material crucial for steel works ? that is in short supply in India.

 India imports 17 million tonnes of coking coal from Australia, bulk of which is produced by Queensland. The import is set to swell as India aims to produce 100 mt of steel by 2020.

 Indian companies should take a long-term view and invest in assets there, David Belham, commissioner of Queensland Trade amp; Investment Office in India, said at a meeting organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), eastern region. He is leading a delegation of Australian mining firms to India.

 India is the third largest importer of coking coal from Australia after Japan and Korea. The Japanese, starved of mineral resources, have adopted a long-term strategy and taken up greenfield development of coal mines there.

 As a result, they get coal at a cheaper rate now, having control over the source of this crucial raw material.

 On the other hand, Indian companies hardly own coal mines there. Since a lions share of the coal is booked on a long-term supply basis, Indian companies end up buying in the spot market, paying a higher price.

 Tata Steel recently bought a 5 per cent stake in a coal mine in Australia, the first Indian steel company to do so. 

 Gujarat NRE Coke, the countrys largest non-captive producer of met coke, also has some blocks in Australia.

 However, the Australians warned that the new mines on offer for development might not match up with the assets that are already in production.

 Their economics would be different. But Indian companies must speed up and try to grab concessions to be distributed in near future, Belham added.

 New mines might come up for production in 2-4 years from now.

 Coking coal has come into focus when international prices shot up last year and supply became erratic. Companies like the Steel Authority of India Ltd had faced problems in procuring the mineral. Coal prices went through the roof to hit $125 a tonne from $60 a tonne in the previous year.

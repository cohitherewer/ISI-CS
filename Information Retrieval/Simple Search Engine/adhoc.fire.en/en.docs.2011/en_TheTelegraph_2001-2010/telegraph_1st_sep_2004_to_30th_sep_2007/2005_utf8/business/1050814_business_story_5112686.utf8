 Ford ready for harder workout to stay fit

 Exit mode

 Detroit, Aug. 13 (Reuters): Ford Motor Company is bracing for more restructuring actions, which may include plant closings and additional layoffs, as it tries to stem steep losses in its key North American vehicle operations. 

 Strong competition, rising health-care and raw material costs and a slide in US marketshare forced the second-largest automaker in the country to slash its profit forecast twice this year. Fords North American auto operations swung to a pre-tax loss of $1.21 billion in the second quarter. 

 The challenge we face isnt a traditional economic downturn, Ford chairman and chief executive Bill Ford Jr. said in an e-mail message to the employees of the company this week. 

 The Ford family scion has been holding off-site meetings with a small group of top executives over the last two months to hash out additional cost-cutting moves, a source familiar with the issue told Reuters. 

 Any kind of restructuring like this is a very holistic kind of thing where nothing is really sacred, said David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research. 

 That may mean the closing of a couple of more plants, Cole said, adding that Fords aging assembly plant in Wixom, Michigan, could be one likely candidate for closure. 

 Ford spokesman Oscar Suris said the company will have a plan ready by the end of the year but declined to be more specific. He did not rule out deeper job cuts in the salaried workforce or the closing of manufacturing plants. 

 There are lots of things that are being discussed, Suris said. An industry source said a major announcement, possibly related to healthcare costs for hourly workers, could come in September. 

 Ford and cross-town rival General Motors Corporation ? which is also struggling with high costs ? are in talks with the United Auto Workers Union to try to slash some healthcare benefits for active and retired hourly employees. 

 GM expects to spend nearly $6 billion in healthcare this year, while Ford estimates spending about $3.5 billion.

 The Detroit automakers are also hurting from this years dramatic slowdown in sales of their profitable mid- and large-size sport utility vehicles (SUVs) amid high gasoline prices. Both have used aggressive discounts, which erode profit margins, to sell down swollen inventories of the unsold SUVs. 

 Ford, which had said its global automotive business would post a loss this year, announced earlier that it will cut its North American white-collar workforce by 8 per cent in 2005.

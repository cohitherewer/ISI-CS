 Coal India slips on target

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 17: Coal India Limited (CIL) has failed to achieve the production target during the first quarter of this fiscal. As against a target of 78.31 million tonnes, CIL had produced 76.96 million tonnes.

 However, coal production achieved in the first quarter of this fiscal is higher than the coal produced in the corresponding period of the previous year. Last year, during the same period CIL had produced 71.60 million tonnes of coal.

 While some of the subsidiaries of CIL have suffered shortage in production, others have surpassed the target.

 Bharat Coking Coal Limited, Central Coalfields Limited and Northern Coalfields Limited have witnessed a shortfall of 1.13 mt, 1.04 mt and 0.56 mt respectively. However, Eastern Coalfields Limited, Western Coalfields Limited and South Eastern Coalfields Limited have produced more than the target.

 The sales realisation of Coal India till June from the power sector ? the major consumer of CIL ? stands at Rs 6,100 crore as against an outstanding of Rs 6291 crore. The total sales realisation of CIL up to June stands at Rs 8356 crore. 

 Import move

 India will import about 14 million tonnes of coal this fiscal to bridge the shortfall that power utilities are currently facing.

 The inter-ministerial energy coordination committee, headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, today decided to expedite coal imports to the tune of 14 million tonnes in 2005-06 for meeting the shortfall.

 The meeting discussed the situation of coal shortage that power companies are facing and the policy options needed to increase coal supply, PMs media advisor Sanjay Baru told reporters after the second meeting of the energy committee.

 Baru said the cabinet secretary had been asked to convene a meeting of the committee of secretaries to discuss steps required to increase domestic production, including that from captive mining. Any specific policy measures would only be decided after the committee of secretaries submits its recommendations.

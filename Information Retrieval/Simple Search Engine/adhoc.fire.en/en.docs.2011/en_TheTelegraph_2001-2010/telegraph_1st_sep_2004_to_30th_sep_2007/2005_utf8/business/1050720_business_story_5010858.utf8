The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Upbeat India Inc shrugs off crude concerns

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 19: India Incs crystal ball is gleaming. Also, it is out of the shadow of high crude prices, which are widely feared to be a trigger for global economic slowdown.

 A survey conducted by Dun amp; Bradstreet India shows that the Composite Business Optimism Index for July-September has risen 5.6 per cent from the previous quarter.

 Three out of six measures ? inventory, employees and net profits ? have increased. On the other hand, the indices meant to gauge net sales, prices and new orders have declined over the previous three-month period. The survey has been carried out in June this year. 

 The performance of the monsoon and future course of oil prices could be key factors in determining business confidence over the next quarter, Dun amp; Bradstreet India CEO Manoj Vaish said.

 Even as firms expect pressures on margins to intensify, they hope to turn in higher profit figures. In all, 89 per cent of the respondents anticipate increase in earnings; only 3 per cent see a slide. 

 The services sector was the most optimistic on profits for the third consecutive quarter while consumer non-durable firms were the least sanguine. The Optimism Index for this was 86 per cent compared with 85 per cent in the previous quarter.

 Companies appear to be optimistic on demand, too. Eighty seven per cent of the respondents expect sales volumes to surge in the quarter. The Optimism Index for this has declined by one percentage point to 84 per cent.

 Approximately 49 per cent of the respondents anticipate selling prices to increase during the forthcoming quarter, while only 9 per cent expect a decline. The Optimism Index for this was 40 per cent, down 8 percentage points. The capital goods sector was most bullish. 

 On order book position, approximately 89 per cent of the respondents expect their position to improve; only 4 per cent anticipate a decline. The Optimism Index for this was at 85 per cent, almost unchanged over the last three-month period. Services was the most bullish on this count.

 The corporate sector also expects more recruitment in the July-September period. About 51 per cent of the respondents are on course to hire more, a rise of 3 percentage points over the previous quarter. Only 5 per cent expect a decline, similar to the previous quarters reading.

 Around 44 per cent of the respondents expect no change in the number of employees. The Optimism Index for employees, thus, stands at 46 per cent compared with 45 per cent in the previous quarter. Capital goods (55 per cent) and service sectors (54 per cent) were the most optimistic.

 The Optimism Index for inventory levels stood at 47 per cent, up from 25 per cent in April-June and 16 per cent in January-March. The readings were the highest for capital goods, followed by consumer durables and basic goods.

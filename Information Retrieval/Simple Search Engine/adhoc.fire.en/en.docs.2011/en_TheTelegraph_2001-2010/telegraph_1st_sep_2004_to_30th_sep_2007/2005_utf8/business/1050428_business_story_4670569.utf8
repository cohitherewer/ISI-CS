 Calcutta, April 27: Australian miner BHP Billiton and India?s largest steelmaker Steel Authority of India (SAIL) are set to form two separate joint venture companies for the development of iron ore and coal assets in India and abroad.

 According to the plan, BHP Billiton will develop iron ore mines for SAIL in India through a JV, while a separate company will take up coking coal mining abroad.

 SAIL could get coal assets in Kalimantan in Indonesia or in Australia. However, the final decision is yet to be taken. 

 Back home, BHP and SAIL are working on an iron ore block in north Orissa, a top BHP Billiton official said.

 More assets will be developed later in Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.

 Both companies will invest an equal amount in the projects. BHP will invest as much in iron ore as SAIL will in the coal block.

 At present, regulatory approvals are being sought for the north Orissa (Thakrany) block. Once the approvals come through, feasibility studies will be carried out. Following this, a valuation will be made to ascertain the investment requirements by each company.

 The development is significant because SAIL has chalked out an ambitious plan to increase saleable steel production to 17 million tonnes by 2011-12 from 10.5 MT.

 The company has enough iron ore to feed its plants for the time being, but it has to develop new mines to guarantee secured supply for the expanded capacity.

 Moreover, SAIL needs an assured supply of coal for which it needs to own mines.

 An estimate shows SAIL will need 25.5 MT of iron ore by 2011-12 every year to achieve its corporate plan as compared with 15.75 MT now.

 The company will need 27.2 MT of coking coal then as against 16.8 MT now.

 At present, only 30 per cent of coking coal is sourced from India and the rest is imported.

 Imports will go up once new capacities are added. 

 The company faced a problem last year when coking coal prices went through the roof to $125 a tonne from $60 a tonne and supply became irregular.

 BHP?s assistance will be more than welcome for SAIL now. Apart from security on coal supply, the Australian miner will also bring to the table latest technologies for developing large deposits in Chiria and Rowghat.

 Bauxite assets

 BHP Billiton is keen to participate in bauxite alumina projects in India and is evaluating some of them, a top company official said. 

 ?Indian companies like Sterlite and Hindalco have announced major projects with multi-billion dollar investments,? the official said. However, BHP is yet to start negotiations with any of those Indian companies.

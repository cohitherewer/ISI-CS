 Left seeks Singhs help to thwart Posco plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 17: Left leaders today asked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to stop Korean steel major Posco from setting up a $12-billion steel plant in Orissa. 

 CPM leader Sitaram Yechury and CPI national secretary D. Raja today asked Singh not to approve Poscos project, the single-largest foreign investment proposal till date.

 The Prime Minister promised to examine the matter, Yechury said. The government has so far backed Poscos plan and intends to allocate 600 MT of iron ore reserves, which will be its feeder stock for 30 years. 

 CPIs Raja said, Posco is trying to gain control over iron ore mines far exceeding its requirements ... this is the first time a proposal for FDI in iron ore mining has come and we need more time to ponder on the issue. 

 The Brazil government has refused to allow Posco in on its own. They forced it to go for a joint venture, he added. 

 Yechury said his party was not opposed to industrialisation in Orissa, but a close look convinced us that industrialisation is just a facade as the state is inclined to auction our precious mineral resources at prices cheaper than a plate of palak (spinach).

 Meanwhile, a meeting of the UPA and the Left coordination committee will be held soon to discuss the Bhel divestment issue which has been strongly opposed by the Left.

 The Prime Minister has agreed to our demand for a coordination committee meeting to discuss the issue, Yechury said.

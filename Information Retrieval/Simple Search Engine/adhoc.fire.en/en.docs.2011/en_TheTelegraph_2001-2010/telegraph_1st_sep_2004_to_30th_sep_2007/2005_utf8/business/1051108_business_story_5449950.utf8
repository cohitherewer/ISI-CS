 Alea locked in sale talks

 London, Nov. 7 (Reuters): UK-listed reinsurer Alea Group Holdings said on Monday it expects to post a net loss for 2005, but it remains in sale talks with potential bidders for all or parts of its business.

 The firm, which dropped plans for a $210-million fundraising in September after its financial strength rating was cut by agency A.M. Best, upped its pre-tax loss forecast from Hurricane Katrina to $55-$70 million, net of reinsurance and including reinstatement premiums.This was up from its previous estimate of $20 million to $30 million, it said in a statement.

 The company said it expected a pre-tax hit of $5 million to $10 million from Hurricane Rita, and another $10 million to $12 million in losses from floods in Europe, also net of reinsurance and including reinstatement premiums.

 Numis Securities forecast the company would post a net loss of ?13.5 million for the year, but said this was likely to increase further due to claims from Hurricane Wilma, which will be included in the fourth quarter figures. It kept itssell recommendation on Alea shares with a price target of 95 pence.

 Alea said it was still pursuing strategic alternatives, including the sale of the group or specific businesses, and said due diligence and talks with potential suitors were continuing.

 But the company cautioned that the talks may not result in a deal or that a sale could be achieved at or above the current market price.

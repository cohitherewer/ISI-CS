 New Delhi, Jan. 17: The government today spoke in favour of creating a parallel market for kerosene, which would rationalise the sale of the cheap fuel to the ?not so needy?.

 The parallel market will reduce the price differential between the open market and subsidised product prices and make the diversion of the subsidised product unattractive to the non-needy, said S. C. Tripathi, secretary, ministry of petroleum and natural gas.

 Addressing a seminar at Petrotech-2005 organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), Tripathi criticised oil companies for abdicating their responsibilities of distributing LPG and kerosene to various states.

 Urging oil companies to take up corporate responsibility, he said LPG had emerged as a major environment-friendly cooking fuel. Oil firms must display corporate responsibility in trying to expand their reach, particularly in the rural areas, said Tripathi.

 He said kerosene dealerships were suffering as petrol pumps proliferated. ?Half the blocks in the country still do not have a kerosene storage facility or a dealership,? he said.

 The government proposes to hold oil companies accountable for the quality of the product dispensed through their dealer networks.

 Companies, he said, need to go beyond their ?narrow and limited? perceptions of quality, price and service as USPs. This is because as competition sets in these parameters will not hold good.

 Terming the oil companies? initiative of expanding the petrol pump network as ?reckless?, he asked them to generate higher volumes per retail outlet.

 In this context, he called for developing a new business and investment model for low volume petrol stations in rural areas. These outlets could become agricentres for sale of diesel, seeds and other mass consumption items to the rural masses.

 Emphasising the need to develop a unique brand identity, which goes beyond a single petrol station giving value-added non-fuel services, Tripathi asked oil companies to experiment with an intermediate grade of fuel between the regular and premium brands.

 This would give a greater choice to customers and be an effective strategy to command customer loyalty, he said.

 ONGC chairman and managing director Subir Raha said there was a new competitive scenario in petro-retailing. 

 Oil find

 Niko Resources of Canada and Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation have struck oil in Hazira. This is being described as a significant development as this is the first time that oil has struck in the gas-bearing region.

 Sources said 5000 barrels of oil flowed out of the exploratory well that was drilled.

 A-I in talks with lenders

 New route 

 Singapore, Jan. 25 (AFP): Air-India is negotiating with banks to help finance the acquisition of 50 new long-range aircraft with deliveries to start next year, civil aviation secretary Ajay Prasad said here today.

 ?We have started negotiations with banks for external financing,? Prasad told reporters on the sidelines of a regional aviation conference, adding that he did not see any difficulties in obtaining the funds.

 He said the new orders would comprise ultra-long range aircraft, medium capacity long-range 350-seater planes and 250-seaters of the same prototype. The initial deliveries are expected in 2006, Prasad said.

 While declining to give a value to the orders, he said it will be a ?very substantial package?. 

 ?Technical and financial bids have been received in December 2004. Air India is likely to come up with firm proposals shortly after due technical and economic evaluation,? Prasad said.

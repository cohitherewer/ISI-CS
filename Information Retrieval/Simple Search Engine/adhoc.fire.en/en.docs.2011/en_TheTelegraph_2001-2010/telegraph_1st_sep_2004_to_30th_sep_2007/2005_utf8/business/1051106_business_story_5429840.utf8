 Colour TV on Zenith screen

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 5: Zenith Finesse, the home-grown consumer electronics company, is now foraying into the colour television (CTV) market.

 The company has tied up with Prima, the leading Chinese CTV maker, for supplying the Finesse brand of products to India. 

 Zenith has booked the production capacity at Prima ? one of the top five CTV brands in China ? dedicated for its own requirements.

 The arrangement is in line with Zeniths strategy to have exclusive arrangements with Chinese producers.

 It does not own any manufacturing facility there, but outsources products from Chinese players. The company books production lines at leading Chinese companies who give exclusive design and features suited for Indian consumers. 

 Zenith has appointed its own people to oversee the production at those facilities. The basic investment, labour and administration are managed by the Chinese companies.

 The products generally take 15-18 days from the factory gate to reach Zeniths warehouse in Bengal.

 Zenith has a range of innovative audio products. It recently launched DVD in the market. 

 It has also forayed into the consumer-durable business by introducing microwave oven.

 We have managed to carve out a market for ourselves in the eastern region, especially in Bengal. Our target is to provide high quality products at affordable prices, said Pritimoy Chakrabarty, director of Zenith Finesse. 

 To begin with, the company will launch 21 inches and 15 inches CTV models later this month. It will also unveil a 20-inch LCD model. 

 Zenith competes with a number of low-cost consumer electronics companies like Media, Oscar, Ronix that have created their own niche in semi-urban and rural markets.

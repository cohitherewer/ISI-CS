 Results trigger stock U-turn

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 19: A sharp recovery in the sensex today was halted in its tracks by investors worried about slowing sales growth at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). 

 The 30-share index ended 22 points lower at 6134.86 after notching up a gain of over 100 points in intra-day trading. TCS? numbers sparked fresh jitters in the market, which feared other infotech majors like Wipro and Satyam Computers will dish out equally bland numbers.

 On Friday, a disappointing guidance from Infosys triggered a 220-point slump in the Dalal Street barometer. This morning, the index opened on a stronger note at 6181.39 before scaling an intra-day high of 6269.75. 

 However, it started losing ground when news of TCS? results started pouring in. The index plumbed a low of 6121.42 before ending at 6134.86, a loss of 0.36 per cent over its last close. Such was the volatility that the sensex swung 148 points between its highest and lowest points.

 The TCS scrip, which fuelled the slide, was battered 8.37 per cent to Rs 1209.75 compared with its last close of Rs 1320.20. The stock also dragged down other infotech shares. Satyam Computer declined Rs 17.85 to Rs 367.85, while Wipro slipped Rs 19.00 to Rs 76.35. Shares of CMC, which announced disappointing results too, fell Rs 85.7 to Rs 522.40.

 In percentage terms, the BSE IT index was the main loser among all the indices on the exchange. It surrendered 57.20 points, or 2.38 per cent, over its last finish.

 ?Ahead of the results, there was an anticipation that domestic firms will report good performance. However, IT companies have either given a poor guidance or their numbers have been below expectations. FIIs, too, have not been buying as heavily now,? a broker explained.

 Figures released by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) showed FIIs as sellers on Friday and Monday. They dumped shares worth Rs 574.40 crore ($131.50 million) on Friday and Rs 456.70 crore ($104.60 million) yesterday. Metal companies also took it on their chin. Leading this pack was Essar Steel, whose shares slumped on reports that trading in the stock will be suspended for a week.

 The volume of business on BSE, however, increased to Rs 1930.13 crore from Rs 1752.82 crore on Monday. TCS was the top traded stock with a turnover of Rs 185.80 crore, followed by Tata Steel (Rs 120.37 crore), Infosys (Rs 85.88 crore), RIL (Rs 81.09 crore) and SBI (Rs 73.30 crore).

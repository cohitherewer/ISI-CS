 Maruti sales hit the skids

 New Delhi, June 1 (PTI): Sluggish export numbers and continued decline in demand for the M-800 model saw the countrys biggest carmaker Maruti Udyog report a 4 per cent drop in sales in May at 42,286 units against 44,212 units in the same month last year.

 Maruti said exports in the month were down a massive 63 per cent to 2,280 units against 6,171 units in the same month last year. On the other hand, M-800 sales fell 39 per cent to 6,116 units compared with 10,016 units in the corresponding period last year, the company said. 

 The companys sales in the domestic market, however, saw a 5 per cent rise to 40,006 units from 38,041 units in May 2004. 

 The company, which last month launched Suzukis world car Swift in the Indian market, has said the response to the model has been very encouraging from the beginning. In fact, it has said its May sales included 2,981 units of the 1.3-litre Swift.

 The hatchback segment, where the company sells models like the Zen, the Wagon R, the Alto and now the Swift, is providing most of the numbers. 

 The segment saw sales increasing 23 per cent last month at 26,030 units compared with 21,137 units in May 2004.

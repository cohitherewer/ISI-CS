 AllBank prices fresh shares at Rs 82

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 14: Allahabad Bank has fixed the offer price for its second public issue at Rs 82 per share. This represents the upper limit of its Rs 75-82 price band.

 The offer of 10 crore shares, which aims to mop up Rs 820 crore, was oversubscribed 9.6 times. ?The offer price has been fixed at Rs 82,? the bank?s executive director, S. K. Goel, said here today. The new shares will be listed as early as tomorrow on major bourses like Bombay Stock Exchange, National Stock Exchange and Calcutta Stock Exchange. Once this happens, the government?s holding in the bank will fall to 55.23 per cent from 71.16 per cent. 

 At Rs 82 per share, the Rs 820-crore collection appears assured. The bank intends to use the money to meet future capital needs arising out of the implementation of the Basel II standards and to expand assets.

 The bank had fixed a price band of Rs 75-82 for the public issue, which opened on April 6 and closed on April 12. It reserved 10 per cent, or one crore shares each, for employees and existing shareholders; the remaining eight crore have been earmarked for the public.

 The bank, which tapped the capital market for the first time in 2002, has a paid-up capital of Rs 346.7 crore, which will rise to Rs 446.7 crore once the shares are allotted. Its capital adequacy ratio will go up to 15.5 per cent from 13.45 per cent.

 If the Basel?II standards are enforced with effect from December 31, 2004, AllBank estimates that its capital adequacy will decline by approximately 2 per cent. Basel?II norms make it mandatory for banks to set aside funds to hedge market and operational risks, in addition to the already existing rules on coping with loan pitfalls.

 AllBank also requires funds to get new plans off the ground, including its overseas expansion and the possible acquisition of a bank in south India to strengthen its presence there.

 Meanwhile, in a move which will boost the utilisation of its ATM chain, the bank will join the national financial switch (NFS) network. ?The NFS, which is an ATM-sharing system, will help the bank?s customers get access to 4000 ATMs across the country,? Goel said.

 Customers of AllBank will be able to swipe their cards at ATMs set up by ICICI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Corporation Bank, Andhra Bank and IDBI Bank ? all of which are members of the switch network.

 NFS is owned and operated by the Hyderabad-based Institute for Development amp; Research in Banking Technology.

 Overseas coal mine hunt put on fast track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 1: Coal India is drawing up a roadmap for its overseas foray, under which more powers will be delegated to executives involved in the decision making process to acquire coal mines abroad.

 Coal India has proposed to float a subsidiary ? Coal Videsh ? to acquire stakes in overseas coal mines or form joint ventures abroad. Even though the ministry is yet to give a go-ahead to the proposed subsidiary, Coal India has set up a department to explore opportunities abroad.

 The entire exercise of formulating a roadmap will take six months to one year, Coal India director (marketing) K. Ranganath said.

 Officials of the department have visited Mozambique, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Australia to explore joint venture options and acquire stakes in coal mines. Coal India is looking at coking coal mines in these countries.

 Ranganath said it is necessary for officials involved in the exercise to take instant decisions on going ahead with a joint venture or acquiring stakes in foreign mines. 

 E-auction of coal

 Coal India aims to sell 10 per cent of its total production through the e-auction platform from 2006-07. It has sold nearly 9 million tonnes of coal through e-auction till October 2005.

 ONGC sees cash in knowhow

 VIVEK NAIR 

 Mumbai, April 12: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is planning to leverage its technological expertise in exploration in an initiative that could lead to a separate strategic business unit. This is part of a larger plan to tap new lines of business to propel growth.

 Officials said there are three areas where the company could share its expertise with others ? exploration-based technology, such as seismic surveys amp; drilling, development of wells and their maintenance. ?Most of us know that we are engaged largely in the exploration business and that we are financially strong. However, what is not as well known is that we have a strong technology know-how. We now want to harness the strength in technology,? a company spokesperson said.

 Officials said a beginning has already been made in this direction with pacts in West Asian countries, Bangladesh and Myanmar. ONGC watchers say the business is large enough to be spun off into a special unit; it could also turn into a big earnings driver overseas.

 Company officials could not put a figure on the potential of the technology-sharing business but estimates for the next few years hover around Rs 500 crore.

 The strength of ONGC?s technological expertise, sources say, is evident from the fact that oil production in 2004-05 increased to 1.2 million barrels per day, up 20 per cent from 1 million barrels in the previous year. ?The 20 per cent rise comes almost entirely from technology improvements, not from new discoveries,? they said.

 The initiative comes at a time when ONGC is looking at diversifying into new areas in an effort to gain a foothold in the entire hydrocarbon value-chain. 

 Apart from its core business of exploration and production, the firm will enter LNG (re-gassification), power, petrochemicals and shipping.

 The corporation will double reserves, improve acreage recovery to 40 per cent from 28 per cent and tie up 20 million tonnes of oil equity abroad. It holds the largest share of hydrocarbon acreages in the country and contributes over 84 per cent to India?s oil and gas production. It also has a tenth of the refining capacity.

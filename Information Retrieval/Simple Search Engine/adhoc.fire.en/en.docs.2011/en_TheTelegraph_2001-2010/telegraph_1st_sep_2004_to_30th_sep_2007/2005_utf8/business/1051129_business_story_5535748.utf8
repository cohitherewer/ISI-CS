 Power-packed tariff policy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Shahi: Charged up

 New Delhi Nov. 28: The cabinet is likely to discuss next week a new power tariff policy, which plans to offer power to end-consumers at Rs 2.00-2.20 a unit, against the existing rate of Rs 3. 

 The tariff policy also aims at promoting competitive bidding among power companies in all three spheres ? generation, transmission and distribution.

 The power ministry is confident that the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and state electricity regulatory commissions will have enough room to promote competition and maintain lower tariff for consumers.

 According to the Electricity Act, 2003, the policy will serve as a guideline for power regulators at the Centre and states. 

 Speaking on the sidelines of the India Economic Summit, power secretary R.V. Shahi said the government was committed to reducing cross-subsidy over the next five years in a phased manner. Cross-subsidy would remain for those living below the poverty line.

 A committee of secretaries has suggested that cross-subsidy surcharge, along with all other charges payable to get an open access, should not exceed the difference between the current tariff of the specific consumer category and the current average cost of supply comprising all costs and charges.

 This is expected to benefit open-access consumers substantially. 

 Shahi said the ministry was not in favour of new power projects adopting gas as a fuel.

 When told that a few projects were awaiting the power ministrys approval to use naptha as a fuel, Shahi said, We have told all our power developers that unless there is greater confidence on availability of adequate quantity of gas or LNG and also predictability of price ... It should not be ventured upon.

 He said it is not shortage of coal but of gas that will be a problem for the power sector. India has projects of more than 10,000 megawatt capacity based on gas as a fuel, of which more than one-third remains unutilised. This is because all of them get only 58-60 per cent of their requirement. 

 Some of the projects in Andhra Pradesh, totalling about 1,500 mw, are waiting for gas linkages to fuel their generating units. 

 We are interacting with secretary to the petroleum ministry, GAIL and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation. We are putting in best efforts. Even LNG is costly, Shahi added.

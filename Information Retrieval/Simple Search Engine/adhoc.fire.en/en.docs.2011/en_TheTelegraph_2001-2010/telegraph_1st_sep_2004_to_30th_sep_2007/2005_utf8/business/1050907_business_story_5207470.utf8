 Retail investors moan over lost ?rights?

 SATISH JOHN

 Mumbai, Sept 6: Companies are scrambling to raise money ? but they are choosing to do so through preferential offers of stocks and convertible bonds to promoters and their friends.

 Retail investors are chafing at the injustice since no one seems to be going in for rights issues anymore.

 With the BSE sensitive index within a tantalising sight of 8000 and stocks riding another bull run, retail investors have bigger reason to gripe.

 Are rights issues passe? 

 ?When a company requires to raise funds quickly, the management will look at alternate routes that are quicker and more efficient,? says Prithvi Haldea of Prime Database.

 The documentation required for a rights issue is as cumbersome as that for an initial public offering (IPO). Under the existing Sebi guidelines, the whole exercise is repeated with an offer document and the rights offer has to be kept open for a month. Corporate bigwigs argue that such a window was relevant in the olden days when shares were physically traded; they do not make sense in a dematerialised regime and feel that the period for keeping a rights issue open should be halved.

 Promoters and the company management want to raise money fast and find the rights issue route too slow and cumbersome, especially when they need to raise funds quickly for projects.

 In the current financial year, companies have raised Rs 952.47 crore through rights issues, statistics with Prime Database reveal.

 It compares very poorly with funds raised through the global depository receipts (GDR) and American depository receipts (ADR) raised during the same period. GDR/ADR funds were almost 10 times more at Rs 9197 crore and they are still counting.

 Foreign convertible currency bonds ? another preferred route adopted by company management ? were used to raise Rs 6,330 crore till date in this financial year.

 Another trend noticed recently is of company promoters awarding themselves preferential offerings. These are blatantly unfair: even though they scrupulously follow the Sebi pricing norms, one has seen that post-issue the stock shoots through the roof giving promoters and their cohorts big notional gains.

 Small shareholders raise this topic regularly at annual general meetings of companies. They want to know why they are bypassed by the management when funds are raised through the equity route. Some promoters say a rights issue is not only time consuming but also the small shareholders would always prefer to buy shares at a discount to the market price. Foreign investors and even high networth investors are willing to pay a premium over the market prices to buy shares. This is in itself an attractive proposition for companies to woo foreign investors.

 Prithvi Haldea argues that the rights issue as a concept will never die. Promoters need to maintain their stake holding at existing levels and the rights issue enables them to do so, he says.

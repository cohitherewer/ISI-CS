 Govt to reopen Airbus deals

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: Stung by charges that Indian Airlines is buying aircraft at prices far higher than those paid by rival companies for similar planes, the cabinet today asked an empowered group of ministers to re-open price negotiations with Airbus. 

 The final round of negotiations will be carried out with the European consortium within a month, sources said after an hour-long meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The EGoM will be set up by the Prime Minister and its decision will be final.

 Indian Airlines has selected Airbus to supply a mix of A-319s, A-320s and A-321s for a combined price tag of Rs 10,237 crore. But a group of MPs had written to Singh pointing out that the same aircraft were being purchased by a southeast Asian airline at a price which was almost half of that being negotiated by Indian Airlines. Similar charges were also made in letters written to the Prime Minister about the Boeing aircraft contracted by Air-India. 

 Civil aviation minister Praful Patel, who had brought a note before the CCEA seeking permission to buy the aircraft, had to face tough questions from the finance ministry on the pricing of the aircraft, even before todays meeting. 

 Revival doles

 The government today approved a Rs 102-crore recast package for Bridge and Roof Company (India) Ltd of Calcutta. 

 The outstanding loan of Rs 11.01 crore till March 31, 2004 has been converted into equity. A waiver of Rs 31.91 crore has been extended to the company for interest on various government loans. A provisional plan assistance of Rs 60 crore has been approved.

 The government also cleared a Rs 500-crore revival package for Punjab and Sind bank.

 WPP in control of Enterprise Nexus

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 Sept. 7: WPP, the largest communications services company, has acquired a controlling interest in Enterprise Nexus, the advertising firm run by Mohammed Khan.

 The acquisition is being routed through its pan-Asian subsidiary Bates Asia. 

 The merged entity will be named Bates Enterprise and will be among the top 10 agencies in India, WPP chief executive Martin Sorrell said.

 Although no sum has been disclosed for the acquisition, it is being estimated at around Rs 50 crore. Bates Asia will be picking up a 74 per cent stake in Enterprise Nexus by buying out Khans 34 per cent stake and Lowes 40 per cent holding in Enterprise Nexus.

 The ad firm was formed in 1997 when Khan merged his Enterprise ad agency with Nexus, owned by former partners Rajiv Agarwal and Arvind Kale.

 Bates Enterprise will be WPPs sixth agency in India. The others are JWT, Ogilvy amp; Mather, Grey Worldwide, Equus Red Cell and Rediffusion DY amp;R. Old-timers in Calcutta will know Bates better as Clarion, its earlier avatar.

 The acquisition is a part of WPPs expansion strategy and is designed to increase Indias contribution to the groups global business, he said. 

 At present business revenue from India is just 2 per cent of WPPs global revenue, he added. The billings from the merged entity is expected to touch around $150 million, Sorrell said. After the merger, Enterprise Nexus founder Mohammed Khan will assume the role of executive chairman of Bates Enterprise, while Bates India chief executive Subhash Kamath will be the CEO. 

 Khan said the merger was expected to get regulatory approvals and be completed within a span of six months. 

 WPP has been focussing on developing its networks in fast growing markets and sectors, Sorrell said. The group plans to focus on India, China and Latin America. 

 Speculation about a WPP takeover of Enterprise Nexus has swirled for almost a year, especially after Interpublic owned Lowe India announced its decision to sell its 40 per cent stake to WPP.

 WPP has been stringing a lot of takeovers over the past two years: it first acquired Cordiant for ?266 million two years ago and then snappped up Bates. Now, the Indian arms of these firms are being slowly acquired.

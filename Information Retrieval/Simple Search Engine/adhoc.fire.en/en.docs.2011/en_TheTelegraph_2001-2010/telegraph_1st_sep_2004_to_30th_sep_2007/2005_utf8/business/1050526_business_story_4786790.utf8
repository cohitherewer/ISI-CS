 IOC sees rise in borrowings

 S. P. S. PANNU

 New Delhi, May 25: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) expects its market borrowing to shoot up by Rs 4,500 crore during the current fiscal. This is because the company is facing increasing financial problems in picking up crude at skyrocketing rates while domestic prices of petroleum products have been held in check.

 A senior IOC official told The Telegraph that the company would be forced to increase borrowing to finance its crude purchases and meet its working capital requirements. The total market borrowing during the year is projected to touch Rs 23,000 crore.

 IOCs market borrowing for the financial year ended March 31, 2005 is reported to be around Rs 18,500 crore, which was Rs 3,500 crore higher than the previous year. This was due to higher international crude prices.

 Senior IOC officials are worried as the increased borrowing will increase the debt servicing burden of the company and funds earmarked for major investment projects may have to be diverted for this purpose.

 Apart from setting up a new grassroots refinery at Paradip and the expansion of its Panipat refinery, IOC has been exploring overseas opportunities both in the upstream oil exploration sector and in downstream refinery projects. Unless the company has hard cash, it cannot afford to go ahead with such ambitious plans.

 Another area of concern is that while IOC can raise loans at low rates of interest at present because of its past financial performance and low debt-equity ratio, the situation would change dramatically if the companys performance continues to nosedive. The loans would then have to be raised at higher rates of interest and this in turn would add to the companys debt servicing burden.

 Senior officials have projected a loss of Rs 600 crore during the first quarter of the current fiscal given the prevailing level of international crude prices and the earnings based on the present domestic prices and taxes levied on petroleum products.

 The oil companies are pinning their hopes on a rollback in the increase in excise tax and 50 paise per litre cess on petrol and diesel to plug a major drain on their resources.

 Technical wings of airline duo to be spun off

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 19: The Union cabinet is planning to hive off ground handling and engineering wings of state-run Indian Airlines and Air-India into separate subsidiaries.

 These could later be turned into joint ventures with foreign firms, which could also include airlines ? a move which the Left may not find acceptable.

 The government is also planning to rename Varanasi Airport after Lal Bahadur Shastri, the former prime minister who hailed from Uttar Pradesh. 

 Sources said the planned JVs for ground handling and engineering could be set up jointly or separately by the airlines after tying up with foreign airlines or other aviation sector firms to optimally use the large technical and human asset bases of the two state- run airlines.

 Almost two years back, Indian Airlines engineers had threatened a wildcat agitation over the airlines plans to join hands with Singapore International Airlines to set up a joint venture engineering and maintenance firm.

 Airline unions had described a memorandum of understanding with Singapore International Airlines Engineering Company to study the feasibility of such a venture as a backdoor attempt to privatise.

 Sources said the proposal made by SIA involved setting up an aircraft maintenance and overhaul facility at multiple locations here. This joint venture was to provide engineering and overhaul facilities to all domestic and global airlines. 

 IA is already providing such facilities to all domestic airlines and to several global airlines, including Silk Air, SIAs sister concern. 

 The move to hive off these units assumes significance as the two airlines will soon be coming out with IPOs and the move could impact the valuation of their shares. 

 Both airlines are in an expansion mode. Late last month, the CCEA gave its stamp of approval to the purchase of 43 aircraft by Indian Airlines from Airbus Industrie. Officials also said that the fleet purchase deal approved for IA was made after extracting certain extra concessions from Airbus. Air-India will be buying some 68 Boeings. The total cost of these big-ticket purchases is expected to be nearly Rs 45,000 crore and the airlines want to perk up their equity base in order to leverage the huge loans needed to fund these buys.

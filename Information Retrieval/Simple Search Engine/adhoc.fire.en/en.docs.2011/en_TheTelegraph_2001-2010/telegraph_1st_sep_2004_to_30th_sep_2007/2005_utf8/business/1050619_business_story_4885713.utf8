 Calcutta, June 18: Purnendu Chatterjee of The Chatterjee Group, one of the principal promoters of Haldia Petrochemicals Limited (HPL), has not set a time limit within which he will buy out the Bengal government?s 36.87 per cent stake in the company.

 ?He has not yet communicated to us since the last board meeting held on May 28. He has not informed us what will be the timeframe within which he will buy out our stake,? Sabyasachi Sen, Bengal commerce and industry secretary, said on the sidelines of seminar organised by Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry. 

 But Sen today indicated that the government would not wait for long for Chatterjee to buy out their stake. ?We want to avoid unnecessary delays,? Sen said. 

 The government has given an offer to Purnendu to buy their stake at Rs 1,560 crore. The government has fixed the price of their shares at Rs 30 ? a premium of Rs 20 on an equity share of Rs 10.

 Sen said Chatterjee had told him during his visit to attend the HPL board meeting that he was busy in getting clearances from the Reserve Bank of India on foreign loans.

 However, he added that the Bengal government, as one of the principal promoters of HPL would no way allow the company to invest in the Dutch petrochemical giant, Basell Polyolefins. A TCG-led consortium has recently bagged Basell through a bidding process at a consideration of $5.7 billion.

 ?A government cannot be a part of a global petrochemicals giant. But if Purnendu buys our stake, then HPL is free to invest in Basell,? he added. HPL needs nearly Rs 2000-2500 crore to become a minority shareholder of the Dutch conglomerate.

 Earlier, speaking at an interactive session on ?Sharing of success stories in manufacturing sector in eastern India?, Sen said that manufacturing is critical to the growth of the state?s economy.

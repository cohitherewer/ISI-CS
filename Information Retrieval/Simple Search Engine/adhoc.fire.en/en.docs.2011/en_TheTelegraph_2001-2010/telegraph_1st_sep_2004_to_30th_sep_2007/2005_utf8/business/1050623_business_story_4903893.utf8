 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Crombie: Balancing act

 Mumbai, June 22: The Edinburgh-based Standard Life today sold 4.9 per cent of its stake in Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd (HDFC) to increase its shareholding in the insurance venture with HDFC.

 The stake sale of around 1.2 crore shares was made at a price of Rs 841 per share, thus placing the deal at over Rs 1,010 crore. Most of the shares were purchased by CLSA Merchant Bankers Ltd. The sale will bring down Standard Lifes holding in HDFC to 9.35 per cent.

 As a result of this deal, HDFC was the top-traded scrip on the BSE today with a total turnover of Rs 1039.40 crore. The scrip ended higher by Rs 28.40 at Rs 871.75.

 Standard Life feels that this stake sale will enable it to increase its shareholding in HDFC Standard Life Insurance Company. It also intends to raise its stake to higher levels after proper regulations are in place. 

 The UPA government is planning to raise the foreign holding cap in insurance ventures to 49 per cent from 26 per cent at present. However, the Left parties, which lend a major support to the Centre is opposed to such a move.

 Sandy Crombie, group chief executive of Standard Life, said, The company expects to remain a major shareholder in one of Indias best known and most successful businesses. However, this share sale rebalances our holding and allows us to increase our direct interest in our insurance joint venture, which we believe has a great future.

 We have a long-standing, and valuable relationship with HDFC, which we hope will continue for many years to come. The Indian financial services market offers strong long-term growth potential and we believe that we have one of the very best partners in that market, he added.

 According to HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh, We deeply value our relationship of over a decade with Standard Life and look forward jointly to further contribute to and develop the life insurance market which has a huge potential in India.

 Apart from the life insurance venture, Standard Life also has partnership with HDFC in the mutual fund segment where it holds around 49.9 per cent in HDFC Asset Management Company.

 Standard Lifes plan to hike its stake in HDFC comes close on the heels of foreign majors like Aviva plc expressing interest in picking up the 26 per cent stake owned by AMP in AMP Sanmar Life Insurance Company.

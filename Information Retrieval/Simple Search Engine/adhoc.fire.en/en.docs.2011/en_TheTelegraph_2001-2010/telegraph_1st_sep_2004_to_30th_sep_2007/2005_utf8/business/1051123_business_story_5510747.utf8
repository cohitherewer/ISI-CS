 Stocks feel the political heat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 22: The results of the Bihar Assembly election sent shivers through the market as investors felt the outcome could weaken the ruling coalition at the Centre. 

 The sensex sank 76 points and even the news that the Left would consider the governments proposal to sell stake in a few public sector undertakings could not lift sentiments.

 In Bihar, the results of the assembly elections saw the JD (U)-BJP combine win an absolute majority, thus wresting power from Lalu Prasads RJD, which had an uninterrupted reign for 15 years. As Lalu Prasad provides crucial support to the government at the Centre, market observers were concerned over the impact that the election result would have on the Centre.

 The results are likely to weaken the government. For instance, there may be some changes in the structure of the Centre as the blame game starts. We may see the exit of one of the constituents of the coalition who could be blamed for Lalu Prasads loss in Bihar. If not, bickering between these two would intensify, an analyst said.

 However, some feel todays fall will be short-lived. They said Lalu Prasads defeat would only help the government as it would now be able to run smoothly without the railway minister dictating things.

 The sensex opened moderately lower at 8602.82 and later moved erratically in a 146-point range between 8664.46 and 8518.18, before closing at 8534.97 against yesterdays close of 8610.74, a net loss of 75.77 points or 0.88 per cent. 

 The index did attempt a smart rally and even stayed within a positive territory for a brief period during the mid-session. However, it fell back sharply in the last one hour as results from Bihar came in.

 Brokers said the expiry of derivative contract on Thursday also contributed to the selling pressure. Discouraging trends in the Asian markets also affected sentiments.

 Metal, oil, bank, technology and PSU scrips suffered a sharp setback, while consumer durable shares saw heavy buying support.

 Volume of business stood at Rs 2757.12 crore. RIL was the most active scrip with the highest turnover of Rs 281.02 crore, followed by SBI (Rs 212.16 crore), Titan (Rs 158.10 crore), Reliance Capital (Rs 155.24 crore) and Satyam (Rs 84.79 crore).

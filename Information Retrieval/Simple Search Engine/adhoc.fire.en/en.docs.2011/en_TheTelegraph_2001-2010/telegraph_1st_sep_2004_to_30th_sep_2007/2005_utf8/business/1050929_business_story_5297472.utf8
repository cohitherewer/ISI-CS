The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 New offer from Hutch

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 28: Hutch today launched the lowest recharge coupons at Rs 10 to increase the talktime of the entry-level prepaid subscriber.

 Hutchison Telecom east CEO Sridhar Rao said, We aim to help subscribers in emerging segments by allowing them to recharge according to their talktime requirement. The chota recharge is expected to make a significant change in the usage patterns of low-end prepaid subscribers.

 Earlier, with the Rs 199 coupon, which allowed an user Rs 50 worth of talktime with a validity period of 30 days, the lowest recharge allowed within the validity period carried a high access charge. 

 The user can now recharge with the chota recharge coupon as and when needed from Rs 10-198 within the validity period. The user can also recharge as many number of times without paying any access fee. Only the 10.2 per cent service tax will be deducted.

 The new coupon will initially result in some revenue loss, but the net additions and increased talktime will make up for it within the next 3-6 months, said Rao.

 He also said with a 15 per cent penetration in Calcutta and 2.5 per cent in the Bengal circle, the market potential is immense. Calcutta would reach the 25-30 per cent penetration levels of Mumbai and Delhi, he added.

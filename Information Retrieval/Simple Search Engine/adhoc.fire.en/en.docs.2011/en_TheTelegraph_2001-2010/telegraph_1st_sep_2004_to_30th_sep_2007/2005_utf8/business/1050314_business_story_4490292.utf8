 Q amp;A

 Budget boosters 

 The income tax exemption limit has been raised to Rs 1 lakh in this budget. Will it be applicable to every individual or be limited to the extent of the investment made?

 Kalyan Kumar Kundu, by e-mail

 Yes, the basic exemption limit has been increased to Rs 1 lakh from the earlier Rs 50,000 since the government has proposed to scrap the benefits of standard deduction and section 80L, which made interest income from various securities tax exempt up to Rs 15,000. Also, the earlier section 88, investment in which up to Rs 1 lakh was entitled for tax rebate, has now been replaced with section 80C. Under the new section, investment in specified instruments up to Rs 1 lakh will be totally deducted from your taxable income. However, the increase in basic exemption limit will be available to all taxpayers whereas the benefit of the new section 80C will be available to those who make the necessary investments required to claim the deduction.

 PPF poser

 In the budget proposals for fiscal 2005-06, will 

 the interest from PPF be tax-free? If this is included 

 in the taxable income, some senior citizens may prefer 

 to withdraw permissible amount of money from the account, 

 and invest in 9 per cent Senior Citizen Savings Scheme.

 H. K. Ghosh, by e-mail

 The finance minister has proposed the introduction of Exempt Exempt Taxable (EET) system, whereby the investment and accumulation will be tax exempt while the withdrawals will be taxable. However, definite guidelines on such system is yet to be announced. As of now, the interest from PPF continues to be tax-free.

 Joint venture

 My wife and I file our income taxes separately. She has invested Rs 6 lakh in post office MIS with me as the second applicant. Can I now invest another Rs 6 lakh with my wife as the second applicant?

 Tapas Chakraborty, Calcutta

 Investment limit in post office MIS is not dependent 

 on the individual income source or filing of income 

 tax returns. The limit of Rs 6 lakh for a joint account 

 is exhaustive and once you are the second applicant, 

 you cannot make further investment.

 Oracle unveils product information solution

 New Delhi, June 7: Oracle today unveiled its product information management data hub (PIM Data Hub), an enterprise data management solution that enables customers to centralise all product information from heterogeneous systems.

 This will help companies create a single product repository that can be leveraged across all functional departments. 

 Oracle claimed that its PIM Data Hub, a component of the recently announced Oracle fusion middleware brand, would help customers eliminate product data fragmentation. 

 This is a problem that often results when companies rely on non-integrated legacy and best-of-breed applications, participate in a merger or acquisition or extend their business globally. Oracle claimed that the new products can be effectively used across all industries, regardless of existing enterprise application environments, including best-of-breed, in-house and legacy. 

 New government and industry regulations such as restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) and waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), as well as retailer mandates around the use of UCCnet and global data synchronisation network (GDSN) standards, are forcing companies to centralise management of all product information. 

 Lora Cecere, research director at AMR Research, said, A technology like Oracle PIM Data Hub is fundamental to a demand-driven supply network (DDSN) strategy.

 Cecere said, Oracle got the concept right by starting with the customer data hub, and has refined it with the new solution. However, this is just a starting point. The effective use of the product data for better decisions is the next step.

 Oracle has also introduced Oracle Product Data Synchronisation for GDSN and UCCnet services.

 Huawei proposal clears DoT hurdle

 New Delhi, Nov. 6 (PTI): The department of telecom (DoT) has favoured the proposal of Chinese vendor Huawei Technologies to set up a manufacturing plant in India subject to the security clearance from the home and external affairs ministries.

 The proposal is currently with the committee of secretaries headed by the cabinet secretary for a closer scrutiny in view of the opposition of home and external affairs ministries on the grounds of security threat.

 The committee had sought DoTs opinion on the issue. The department is understood to have given a go-ahead but with a caveat that it should be cleared only if the issues raised by the ministries are addressed.

 Huaweis $60-million proposal had been pending with Foreign Investment Promotion Board since March and was not able to go ahead because of objections from the external and home ministries, who have cited security risk as reasons for not allowing a Chinese firm to get exposure Indias strategic telecom network.

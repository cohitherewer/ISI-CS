 Big push to road network

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Baalu: Action time

 New Delhi, April 14: The ministry of road transport and highways has drawn up an ambitious Rs 12,000-crore investment plan for ?a special accelerated road development programme? for the north-eastern region. The project will cover 7,600 km of road length out of which 3,251 km will be national highways.

 Minister for road transport and highways T. R. Baalu said today the proposal would be soon sent to the cabinet for its approval.

 The minister also unveiled the contours of the next three phases (V, VI and VII) of the national highway development programme, which will be completed by 2012 mainly on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis.

 In Phase V, about 5,000 km of national highways will be selected for six-laning on a BOT basis. These will include sections with high density of traffic or corridors, which are otherwise important for tourist or economic reasons. ?The programme is being finalised,? the minister added.

 Phase VI will focus on the construction of expressways under which 1,000 km of road length is proposed to be taken up to connect important commercial and industrial townships. 

 Tentatively 400 km of the Vadodara-Mumbai section has been identified for the construction of an expressway. This would complete the expressway link between Ahmedabad and Mumbai.

 A study supported by the World Bank is being taken up to identify other sections. The work on these expressways will be taken on BOT basis. 

 Phase VII proposes to take up the construction of ring roads for proper regulation and movement of traffic in ?several important cities?.

 Similarly, in many existing corridors there is a need for additional flyovers and bypasses because of the growth of new habitations along the highways and increasing traffic, the minister said.

 As far as the four-laning of the golden quadrilateral ? linking the four metros ? is concerned, the Delhi-Calcutta section is lagging behind the other segments with only 61 per cent of the work having been completed. In contrast, about 98 per cent of the Delhi-Mumbai stretch is complete. The Chennai-Calcutta section is almost 82 per cent complete. 

 Baalu said 80 per cent of the work in the Delhi-Calcutta section would be completed by December this year.

 The minister said the UPA government has constituted an empowered committee of secretaries under the chairmanship of the cabinet secretary to resolve these issues and expedite work.

 Taxation bill sails through

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 20: Parliament today passed a bill exempting nearly 60,000 small exporters from taxes under the duty entitlement passbook (DEPB) scheme after the Rajya Sabha cleared the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2005 by a voice vote. 

 It also extends tax incentives to export businesses with effect from assessment year 1998-1999 under the DEPB and Duty Free Replenishment Certificate schemes. The new bill, once made into a law, will replace an ordinance already passed by the Union cabinet. 

 It includes amendments to exempt from withholding tax any payment received in respect of a lease of an aircraft or aircraft engine by the government of a foreign state or enterprise. Most airlines, including Air-India and Indian Airlines, have been demanding this, since they have been leasing aircraft. Finance minister P. Chidambaram said the date for such exemptions for lease of aircraft has been extended to March to enable the two state-run airlines to finalise their leases.

 Chidambaram said the government had decided to extend exemption from withholding tax on sports events such as the mini-world cup to be staged next year.

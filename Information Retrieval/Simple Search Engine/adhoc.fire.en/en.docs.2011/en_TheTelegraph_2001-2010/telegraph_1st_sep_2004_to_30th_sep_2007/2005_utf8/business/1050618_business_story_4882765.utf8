 Telecom twins fail Trai test on parameters

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 17: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd have failed to offer telephones within a week and took inordinately long to attend to telephone faults.

 According to a Quality of Service Parameters report released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) for the quarter ended March, the performance of MTNL and BSNL is less than 50 per cent against the benchmark of 100 per cent. 

 The company has scored 43.83 per cent in Calcutta and 37.90 per cent in Bengal.

 Reliance Infocomm Ltd has reported 100 per cent promptness in service in all its circles. 

 Trai stipulates that fault incidences per month per 100 telephones should be less than three faults. BSNL and MTNL have failed to meet the benchmark for this parameter in any circle, while private operators have achieved it.

 The state-owned telecom majors have also failed miserably on customer-care parameters. Trai has stipulated that the company should have 95 per cent promptness in attending to customers requests. 

 The benchmark for shifting of telephones is less than three days, closure of service is less than 24 hours and providing additional facilities should be within 24 hours. 

 BSNL has scored nil in this against the Trai benchmark of 95 per cent. MTNL has also failed to meet requirements on customer care. 

 Among private operators, Shyam Telelink (Rajasthan), Tata (Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Chennai) and Reliance Infocomm (all circles) have met the benchmark on customer care in shifting.

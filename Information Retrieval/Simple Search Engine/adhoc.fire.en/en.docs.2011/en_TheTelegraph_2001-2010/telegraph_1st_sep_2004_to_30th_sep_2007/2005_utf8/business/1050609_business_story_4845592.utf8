 Turbo charge for expansion projects

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 8: Anil Ambani today laid before shareholders Reliance Energys mega expansion plans. 

 A rough calculation shows the company intends to spend more than Rs 90,000 crore on various projects to be completed in phases.

 However, the Reliance Energy chairman did not reveal the source of funds for the projects. The companys turnover has crossed the $1-billion-mark (Rs 4,370 crore) this year.

 The Orissa project is at a conceptual stage. So far, no money has gone into it, he added. Reliance Energy plans to set up a coal-fired power plant in the state in a phased manner at an estimated cost of Rs 48000 crore. 

 We are asking for only 10 per cent of the coal reserves in the region to run this project, he said.

 The company is already building the worlds largest gas-based plant in Uttar Pradesh at an estimated cost of Rs 11,000 crore. 

 The gas for the 3,740-MW project will be supplied by Reliance Industries from the Krishna-Godavari basin by 2008. Details of the pricing were, however, not revealed. 

 The ownership differences had put a cloud on the Dadri project. Ambani, however, reiterated that the project would go on stream by 2008-09, the time-frame indicated earlier. 

 He also said the company was examining the feasibility of a 4,000-MW, gas-based project in Maharashtra. 

 Reliance Energy, which has secured licences to sell power in New Delhi, Mumbai and a few other cities, has less than 900 MW of generating capacity. However, it sources the rest ? at least 5,000 MW ? from other companies, including rival Tata Power.

 Pointing out that Indias installed generation capacity was just 118,000 MW compared with Chinas 400,000 MW, Ambani said: The generating capacity needs to be quadrupled in the next two decades to over 400,000 MW to meet the growing demand. This requires an investment of Rs 12,00,000 crore.

 Ambani said the company has been chosen as a preferred partner for a Rs 750-crore joint venture with PowerGrid for a hydropower unit in Himachal Pradesh. 

 Reliance Energy shares rose 3.1 per cent to Rs 566.30 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.

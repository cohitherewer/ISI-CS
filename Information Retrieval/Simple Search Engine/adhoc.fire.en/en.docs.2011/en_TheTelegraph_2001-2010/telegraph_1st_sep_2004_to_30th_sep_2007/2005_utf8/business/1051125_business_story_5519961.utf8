 FIPB okays Coca-Cola proposal

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 24: The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) has cleared US-based Coca-Colas proposal to pump in an additional amount of Rs 550 crore in its bottling arm ? Hindustan Coca-Cola Holdings Pvt Limited.

 The board has also approved a proposal of Holland-based Rabo Bank to increase its shareholding in Yes Bank with a maximum limit of 20 per cent involving a sum of over Rs 8 crore.

 The board nod was also received by Philip Morris (known more for its flagship tobacco brand Marlboro) for importing cash-and-carry wholesale trading of agro-based food products, including pasta, vegetable puree/paste, sauce and cheese. The proposal, however, does not involve any FDI as it pertains primarily to trading.

 The proposal of British telecom firm Vodafone for induction of Vodafone Mauritius Limited as a foreign investor with a maximum equity of 49 per cent in Bharti Enterprises was also okayed.

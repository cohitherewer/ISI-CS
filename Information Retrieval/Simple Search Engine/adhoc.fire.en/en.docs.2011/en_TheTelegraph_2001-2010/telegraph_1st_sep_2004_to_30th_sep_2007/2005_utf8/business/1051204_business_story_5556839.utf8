 World Bank watch on Hong Kong build-up

 Wolfowitz: Alert

 New York, Dec. 3 (Reuters): With the world trade talks just over a week away, World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz said on Friday there was too much at stake for the poor and the world economy as a whole to allow the Doha round to completely fail.

 In a speech to the National Foreign Trade Council in New York, Wolfowitz said progress toward cutting barriers to farm trade and removing market-distorting subsidies meant huge gains for the poor countries.

 Clearly (WTO) chief Pascal Lamy hasnt given up and I think we need to do everything possible to remind people just how big the stakes are here, Wolfowitz said in an interview with reporters afterwards.

 It really is about the poorest people of the world, its about giving them opportunities to take care of their children (which) tends to get swallowed up in these dry technical discussions among people who think their main job is to represent vested interests, he added.

 Wolfowitz said the biggest danger of failure at the December 13-18 Hong Kong ministerial was that progress made since the current round of talks on a new world trade deal were launched in Doha, Qatar, in 2001 could be rolled back.

 Among the dozens of items on the agenda of the Hong Kong discussions, the biggest issue ? and the most contentious ? is how to cut barriers to farm trade and where rich nations disagree the most.

 The World Bank has calculated that a successful Doha round could lift 140 million people out of poverty and estimated that $287 billion could be gained from global trade liberalisation.

 Wolfowitz said agricultural protection in wealthy countries was the most harmful and simply not defensible. Still, he said trade barriers in developing countries themselves were also holding them back.

 Trade matters for the poorest countries, Wolfowitz said in his speech.

 It offers hope and opportunity for the small entrepreneurs, who want to start a business, to create jobs and expand their business by tapping into the global market. It can help farmers more from subsistence agriculture to cash crops.

 Wolfowitz said he hoped a meeting this weekend of the finance ministers of the worlds Group of Seven (G-7) wealthy countries would help resolve the trade deadlock.

 With respect to the trade negotiators ? and I know many of them ? but they tend a little bit to be pressured heavily by the trade interests, he said. I hope the finance ministers will weigh in with a larger interest in both the large economic issues but particularly the challenges of the worlds poor.

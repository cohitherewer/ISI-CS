 Ranbaxy echoes peers, blames it on VAT

 Bitter pill 

 New Delhi, April 28: The net profit of Ranbaxy Laboratories plunged 63 per cent to Rs 70.8 crore in the first quarter ended March 31 from Rs 190.6 crore in the year-ago period.

 Consolidated sales also fell 12.4 per cent to Rs 1138.3 crore from Rs 1307.9 crore during the same period in the previous year.

 Like Wockhardt last week, Ranbaxy blamed it all on value-added tax (VAT) that was introduced from April 1.

 ?The first quarter was an unusual one for the company with a number of abnormal events in its key markets.These include the introduction of VAT, Quinapril litigation in the US and the phasing of European first-day launches that impacted sales and profits. In India, the trade started de-stocking prior to the implementation of VAT, severely affecting the pharmaceutical industry. In the US, market and pricing conditions remained soft,? the company said in a statement.

 The board of Ranbaxy Laboratories recommended a final dividend of Rs 12 per share. An interim dividend of Rs 5 per share was paid in 2004, bringing the total dividend per share to Rs 17. The total dividend amount (including dividend tax) for 2004 was Rs 360.3 crore (Rs 356.1 crore in 2003). The board has also approved a stock split of the existing shares with a face value of Rs 10 each into units with a face value of Rs 5 each, subject to necessary approvals of the shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.

 The board has also approved the audited accounts for the year ended December 31, 2004. Consolidated sales in 2004 rose 17 per cent at Rs 5313 crore (Rs 4530.1 crore in 2003) but after-tax profit fell 8 per cent at Rs 698.6 crore from Rs 759.4 crore in 2003.

 Profit before tax and extraordinary items fell 5 per cent at Rs. 926.4 crore (Rs 979.6 crore). Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis were Rs 37.48 (Rs 39.16 in 2003).

 In the first quarter of 2005, the company recorded a sales of $80 million ($105 million in 2004).

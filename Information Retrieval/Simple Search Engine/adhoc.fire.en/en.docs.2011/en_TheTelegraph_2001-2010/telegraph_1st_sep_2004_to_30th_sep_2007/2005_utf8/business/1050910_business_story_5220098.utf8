 Ranbaxy to tap US market for funds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Sept. 9: The Ranbaxy Laboratories board today approved a proposal to list on a US bourse and raise up to $1.5 billion through convertible bonds, global depository receipts (GDRs) or American depository receipts (ADRs).

 The company has informed the stock exchanges that the listing of its securities in the US will be either by converting existing GDRs into ADRs or by issuing fresh security. The board also approved a proposal to raise resources through appropriate securities such as foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs), GDRs and ADRs and any other appropriate instrument up to $1.5 billion equivalent from time to time. 

 Ranbaxy will now convene an extra-ordinary general meeting on October 21 to seek shareholders approval.

 A company spokesperson told The Telegraph that these proposals, including the plan to raise $1.5 billion, were only an enabling step and that their timing, nature or amount has not yet been decided. 

 The amount raised from the instrument will be used to fund the companys organic or inorganic plans. Ranbaxy, which now has presence in the US and Europe, is in the race to acquire the US operations of Alpharma. It plans to become a research-based international pharmaceuticals company.

 During the second quarter this year, Ranbaxys US operations achieved sales of $82 million, down from $92 million in the corresponding period last year.

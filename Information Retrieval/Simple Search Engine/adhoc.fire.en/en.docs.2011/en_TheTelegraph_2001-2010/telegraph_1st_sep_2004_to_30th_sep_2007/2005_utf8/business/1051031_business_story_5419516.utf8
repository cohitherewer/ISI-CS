 Hind Glass in growth push 

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Oct. 30: After acquiring Larsen amp; Toubros glass container business recently, Calcutta-based Hindustan National Glass and Industries is now contemplating to get into float glass manufacturing ? the speciality finds applications in architecture and automobile. The company has also chalked out Rs 750-crore expansion over the next 2-3 years ? Rs 500 crore for the float glass venture and Rs 250 crore for modernisation of existing facilities.

 The domestic float glass market, estimated at Rs 3,500 crore at present, is dominated by multinationals like Saint-Gobain and Asahi. 

 Hindustan Nationals decision to venture into the speciality glass manufacturing stems from the fact that the highest consuming sectors, namely housing and automobile, have been growing at double-digit rates in India, fuelling a 15 per cent demand growth for float glass per annum.

 Taking a cue from the current trend in demand, Saint-Gobain and Asahi are all drawing up expansion plans.

 The glass container market, in contrast, where Hindustan National Glass has about 67 per cent market share after the acquisition of L amp;Ts Nasik unit, is estimated at Rs 1,400 crore ? less than half the size of the float glass market. Its growth rate is also much lower at 7-8 per cent per annum than the float glass segment.

 Mukul Somany, joint managing director of Hindustan National Glass and Industries, said the opportunity to gain market share in the existing business (glass container) was limited given that the company has already been controlling two-thirds of the market.

 The company is at present looking for a location to put up the float glass facility.

 Hindustan National Glass has five plants in Rishra, Rishikesh, Pondicherry, Delhi and Nasik.

 Our target is to gain 15 per cent market share in the next 5 years, Somany added. 

 The new location could be close to a port since it plans to export 30-40 per cent of its production.

 Financing model

 A new company will be set up for the float glass venture. For this, Hindustan National Glass is considering to team up with a foreign collaborator.

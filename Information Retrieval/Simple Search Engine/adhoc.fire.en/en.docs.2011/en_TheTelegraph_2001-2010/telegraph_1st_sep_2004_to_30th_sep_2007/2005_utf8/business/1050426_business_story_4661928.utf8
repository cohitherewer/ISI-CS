 Son better bet than pension

 Filial ties 

 New Delhi, April 25: The joint family system in India may be cracking up, but filial ties remain as strong as ever. At least that?s what parents think.

 An AC Nielsen study on pension reforms says 42 per cent of Indians are confident that their children will take care of their financial needs in old age; another 34 per cent believe that the kids they raise just might do so.

 ?There is a great amount of distrust in dealing with multinational companies,? said Sandeep Ghosh, senior manager (client service), ORG Centre for Social Research.

 Nowhere in the survey do the respondents cite ?pension? as the real cause for their savings. Chronologically, saving patterns were attributed to social and religious obligations, education and finally marriage of their children. 

 The respondents listed the safest investments as real estate, gold, bank deposits and insurance cover from the national insurer.

 The study revealed that Indians in the eastern part of the country were the most conservative investors while their counterparts in the western region were the most bold. 

 There doesn?t seem to be a great deal of support for funnelling retirement funds in the equity markets ? an investment option that is at the heart of the new pension scheme for government employees. How do you get around the problem?

 Through education, says PFRDA chief D Swarup who unveiled the study today. ?Yes, it is indeed an ambitious plan to get the new pension system working, but we need to make a start somewhere;.?

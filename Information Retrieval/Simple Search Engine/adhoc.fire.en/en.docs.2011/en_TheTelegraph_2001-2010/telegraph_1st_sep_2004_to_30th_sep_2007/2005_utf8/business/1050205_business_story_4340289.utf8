 Telecom law keepers in turf war

 R.VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Feb. 4: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and the Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) are locked in a battle over who has the jurisdiction to decide on a dispute raised by a service provider.

 The Supreme Court today issued notices to the TDSAT on a Trai petition that challenged the appellate tribunal?s order that the telecom regulator had ?no authority to adjudicate on disputes between service providers?.

 A division bench of Justices Arijit Pasayat and S. H. Kapadia issued notice to Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) also as it was in a case pertaining to the telecom service provider on which the TDSAT passed the order.

 Trai counsel Sanjay Kapoor contended that an important question of law that has arisen is whether Trai, which fixes the terms and conditions for interconnectivity among service providers, has any role to play in case of a dispute between two or more service providers.

 ?Is the regulator powerless to intervene in a case where a dispute is likely to arise and or having arisen, which may have serious implications for the telecom industry?? the petitioner asked.

 Provisions of the Trai act on the powers and functioning of the regulatory authority and TDSAT should be ?construed harmoniously? to ensure effective functioning of both the authorities, the counsel said.

 TDSAT quashed certain orders of Trai on the issue of disconnection of points of interconnection by BSNL with other operators on the ground of non-payment of interconnect usage charges. TDSAT, on an appeal, had set aside the Trai order.

 On a petition filed by BSNL, TDSAT ruled, ?When dispute arises on the issue of breach of licence agreement or on the question of inter-connectivity between the service providers, it is the appellate tribunal which is the sole judicial authority to decide the dispute and not Trai.?

 In another issue relating to concessional alternate tariff package, the court issued notice to basic telecom operators on a petition filed by BSNL challenging the TDSAT order asking it to extend the concessional alternate tariff package, offered by it to its customers, to the subscribers of other service providers.

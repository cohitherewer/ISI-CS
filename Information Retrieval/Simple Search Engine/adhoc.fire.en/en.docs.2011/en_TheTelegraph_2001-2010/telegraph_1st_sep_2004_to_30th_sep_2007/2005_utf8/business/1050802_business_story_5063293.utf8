 Pakistan to lift sugar ban soon

 Karachi, Aug. 1 (Reuters): Pakistan will lift a four-year ban on sugar imports from India, government officials said on Monday. Pakistan is struggling to rein in domestic prices of the sweetener to cushion the impact of high inflation.

 Government officials in New Delhi welcomed the move and Indian traders said they would be able to supply sugar at competitive prices.

 Pakistan and India, which have fought three wars in half a century, import commodities from as far away as South America despite having surpluses to meet each others needs.

 Pakistans attempts to check sugar prices that reached a four-year high in February have been thwarted by low rainfall, which is set to trim its crop by at least a fifth. Imports from other countries havent been enough to make up the shortfall.

 We have decided to allow sugar imports from India, and a formal announcement in this regard is expected soon, a senior government official said.

 The decision is due for approval on Tuesday at a meeting of Pakistans economic co-ordination committee. The ban would probably be lifted immediately, another official said.

 Pakistan banned imports from India in 2001 after its domestic industry said cheap Indian sugar was hurting cane growers and processors.

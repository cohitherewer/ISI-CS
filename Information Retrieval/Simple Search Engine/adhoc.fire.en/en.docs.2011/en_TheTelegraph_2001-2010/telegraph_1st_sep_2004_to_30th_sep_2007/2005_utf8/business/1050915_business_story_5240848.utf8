 CESC on fund-raising trip

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Sept. 14: CESC, the RP Goenka power utility, will start a fresh hunt for overseas funds for its proposed 1,000-mw power plant in Jharkhand.

 The company is mulling several options like foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs), GDR or a general loan for this new project, which will cost Rs 4000 crore.

 The company will float a $40-million GDR issue for funding its 250-mw Budge Budge third unit. The total cost of this project is Rs 1,000 crore, which is being funded by an equity of Rs 300 crore and a debt of Rs 700 crore.

 Sources said once this GDR issue is over, the company will start roadshows. In the last two years, the company has approached foreign investors in Singapore and the US. 

 The principal overseas lenders of CESC are IFC-Washington, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, ADB and Actis. CESCs total foreign loans at the current exchange rates are pegged at Rs 1,226 crore.

 We are signing a memorandum of understanding with the Jharkhand government for the proposed thermal power plant. Once the MoU is signed, we have to carry out project reports and ensure the coal linkages, vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said.

 He refused to speak about the funding. We cannot talk about it right now, he added.

 The company has also approached the Orissa government with a proposal to set up a 2000-mw thermal plant. The total cost of the project is Rs 8,000 crore.

 Sources said talks with the Orissa government are at an advanced stage. Negotiations are on. We expect something to emerge shortly, sources added. 

 The company is also open to the idea of setting up another power plant in Bengal.

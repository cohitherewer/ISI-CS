The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 EU wants better trade ties

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 13: The European Commission today suggested that India should explore the idea of a new bilateral trade agreement with the European Union based on the protection of geographical indications and regulatory co-operation and convergence.

 Speaking at the CII summit in Calcutta, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson said: ?Our new joint action plan should mark the beginning in building trade and investment links. We have already concluded agreements on scientific, technological and customs co-operation. An agreement will soon be reached on the Galileo satellite navigation system. We are about to start negotiations on an EU-India maritime agreement.?

 Mandelson said despite interest in India, investments from the EU has remained low. ?Uncertainty is the greatest deterrent. A predictable regulatory environment and legal certainty are key conditions for a positive investment climate. India should also address the issue of intellectual property protection to provide confidence to investors,? he added.

 Mandelson also urged industry to demand transparency and mutual understanding of regulatory systems and work together to promote internationally accepted practices.

 He added that India should drop the overall restrictive trade regime, which includes the highest tariffs in the world and a range of non-tariff barriers like import bans and mandatory certification.

 The EU and Indian industry have already identified trade obstacles in eight sectors through the Joint Initiative for Enhancing Trade and Investment.

 Commenting on India?s role in the global market, Mandelson said: ?India needs to match its growing economic weight by taking up more responsibility in multilateral negotiation.?

 India still faces a daunting challenge of poverty, with three hundred million people living on less than a dollar a day, he said. Moreover, the country that counts for a fifth of the world population accounts for less than a fiftieth of world trade, he added.

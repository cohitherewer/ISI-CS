 Bharat Forge finds its bearings in China

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 8: Bharat Forge Ltd, which has been acquiring companies in the US and Europe, today spread its wings to China. The Pune-based auto component maker entered into a joint venture with FAW Corporation for its forging business.

 BFL will pick up a majority stake in this venture for an undisclosed sum. It will finance the deal through internal accruals.

 FAW is the largest automotive group in China and a market leader in both passenger car and commercial vehicle segments.

 The forging company of the FAW group, touted as the largest in China, will be hived off into a separate company in which Bharat Forge will hold a 52 per cent stake and the rest will be with the Chinese partner. 

 The agreement was signed by BFL chairman B.N. Kalyani and Dong Chunbo, chairman of FAW Forging Ltd and director on the board of FAW Group. 

 Bharat Forge said through this JV, it would make a powerful entry into the large and fast growing Chinese automotive market.

 By tying up with the largest forging firm in China, BFL will get a strong customer base across all segments. 

 The JV will manufacture a wide range of highly engineered forged auto components for commercial vehicles, passenger cars and light trucks. It will address the Chinese manufacturers as well as plants of global firms in that country.

 Talking about the potential of China, Kalyani told reporters that the size of the Chinese automobile market is four times that of India.

 In 2004-05, 0.35 million commercial vehicles and 1.14 million passenger cars were sold in India. By contrast, 2.8 million commercial vehicles and 2.3 million passenger cars were sold in China. By 2010, commercial vehicle sales in China are expected to rise to 5.1 million and passenger cars to 4.3 million. 

 This joint venture is a step in the direction of reiterating our commitment to providing world-class forging technology to China, the fastest-growing automotive market in the world, Kalyani said.

 The ventures manufacturing facility will be located in Changchun in Northern China. The total annual forging capacity will be more than 1 lakh tonnes and employ about 1,700 employees. The plant will manufacture forged auto components for commercial vehicles, buses, light trucks and the passenger car industry in China. It will be established after obtaining regulatory approvals in China.

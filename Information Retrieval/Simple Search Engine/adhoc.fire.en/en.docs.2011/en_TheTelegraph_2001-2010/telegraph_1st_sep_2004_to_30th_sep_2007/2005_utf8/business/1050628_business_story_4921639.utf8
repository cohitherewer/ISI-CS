 Nokia venture funds zoom on local start-ups 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 27: Blue Run Ventures and Nokia Growth Partners, both venture capital firms, will fund start-ups in India. The projects would focus on information technology, telecommunications, technology-enabled infrastructure and software for consumer electronics.

 Blue Run Ventures is a global venture capital fund which invests in the initial phase of start-ups in the IT, mobile and consumer electronics markets. Nokia Growth Partners focuses on mid-to-late stage projects and thus complements BlueRun Ventures.

 Both firms are supported by Nokia Corporation.

 In India, Blue Run Ventures has shortlisted about 10 such companies, in which it may invest $2-5 million on an average. The firms have already invested in two ventures in the country.

 Sujit Banerjee, principal of Blue Run Ventures, said: We are looking at a start up that would provide the design, architecture and other support in a semiconductor fabricator.

 It is a new area and we are aware of the recent initiative announced by the government. We are excited and encouraged about the semiconductor opportunity.

 We are very impressed with the semiconductor designs from India. The growth in manufacturing with technology as the main driver is good for many start ups and we are excited about it, said Banerjee.

 Semiconductors are installed as microprocessor chips in electronic equipment. They drive our computers, personal hand-held devices, mobile phones, watches and even cars.

 The two firms are interested in Indian start-ups as they are fast emerging as a hot bed of entrepreneurial talent and technology innovation. The firms are keen to fund start-ups involved in developing low-end disrupters, services, product options, mobile infrastructure and low-end computers and handhelds.

 John Gardner, founding partner of BlueRun Ventures, said: The value proposition for investing in Indian companies creates some of the most significant, emerging opportunities for venture capitalists. We are not looking at BPO companies in India but software development purely due to the best intellectual property environment.

 The venture capital firm will also examine proposals from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and Indian Institute of Management (IIM).

 Vasudev Bhadarkar, venture-partner Blue Run, said: We are looking at some of the projects recommended by the IITs. These institutes have provided a lot of the raw material and innovation and enterpreneurship that happens out of Silicon Valley. So naturally it is good to work with IIT to catch them young.

 Last year, Nokia Growth Partners had announced an investment of about $10 million in Pune-based Nevis networks and $3 million in Bangalore-based Sasken. Worldwide, the two firms have invested about $700 million in various start-up projects and will release about $350 million during 2005.

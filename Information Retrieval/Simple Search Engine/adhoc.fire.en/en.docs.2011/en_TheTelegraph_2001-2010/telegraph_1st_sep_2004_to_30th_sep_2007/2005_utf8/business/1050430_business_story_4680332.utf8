 Washout fears fade at Lever

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 29: First-quarter profits at Hindustan Lever (HLL) slipped 15 per cent to Rs 259 crore as high raw material costs and price pressures smothered gains from sales, which grew 6.9 per cent to Rs 2,506.38 crore from Rs 2,353.34 crore in the first three months of last year.

 Analysts, however, are enthused by the modest, but encouraging, rise in sales, and feel the company could finally be seeing some light at the end of a long tunnel in which its fortunes have been hurt by price-warrior rivals. Chairman M. S. Banga echoed much the same feeling when he said after the results: ?You can?t get long-term growth in profitability without expanding the topline?.

 Profit margins have been under pressure since last year, when Lever offered cheaper products in response to Procter amp; Gamble, its arch-rival that threw the price gauntlet.

 Some analysts said the first-quarter profit represents only a marginal drop in over a year, indicating that an end to the downtrend might be near. This could also signal an increase in prices in the near term.

 ?We don?t expect input prices to ease. We?ll counter this with judicious price increases and cost reduction,? Banga said. Refusing to say how the company will fare in the coming months, Banga said he could not predict anything beyond an increase in profits. A morose market, however, could not look beyond the profit drop, sending Lever shares dropping 4 per cent to Rs 137.7 on the BSE. 

 ?HPC growth has accelerated strongly, reflecting the success of our competitive strategy and brand investment. We have grown strongly in most competitive categories of hair care and laundry items. On costs, the hardening of commodity prices presents a challenge,? Banga told reporters.

 First-quarter revenues from home and personal care rose 9.6 per cent from a year ago, but revenues from foods ? a new area of focus ? declined around 3 per cent. It was in this segment, which gives it two-thirds of sales, that Lever had to fend off attacks from P amp;G, Marico, Dabur, Godrej Consumer Products and Nirma.

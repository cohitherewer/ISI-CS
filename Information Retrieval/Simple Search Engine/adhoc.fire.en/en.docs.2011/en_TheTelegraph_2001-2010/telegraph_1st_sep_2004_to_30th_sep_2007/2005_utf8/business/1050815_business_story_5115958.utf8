 Planning to head for that dream destination? Chandralekha Tulal tells you how to stop fretting about the tax on LTA

 Tax is not always tiresome. There are many sections in the Income-Tax Act that allow an individual to claim concessions for expenses incurred against benefits received. Here, we will take a look at one such section pertaining to the Leave Travel Allowance or LTA.

 What is LTA?

 It is a monetary benefit that you get on the expenses you incur when you travel. It is not a fringe benefit. And you can claim a leave travel concession (LTC) on the amount. 

 On what basis can LTC be claimed? 

 You can claim LTC provided you fulfil two criteria: apply for leave and actually travel during the leave period. However, the travel is applicable anywhere in India and not abroad.

 What is the proof of travel to avail of LTC?

 You have to produce proof of travel such as an air, rail or any public transport ticket. You can even submit the bills issued by the car rental company if you rent a vehicle. Since the travel is applicable only in India, an international air ticket will not be valid.

 Can I claim the total LTA as tax concession?

 You can receive LTA as either a reimbursement or as an allowance. In case you receive LTA as reimbursement, it is not taxable. 

 Let us suppose you produce an air ticket of Rs 10,000 as proof of travel. The company reimburses the full amount as LTA. In such a case, you can claim the full amount as LTC and it will be exempt from tax. 

 If you get LTA but do not submit any proof of travel, you will have to pay tax on it. However, if you produce proof of travel, it will not be taxable to the extent of the amount that is supported by documents relating to proof of travel. Lets say you are entitled to Rs 50,000. For proof of travel, you produce an air ticket of Rs 10,000. So, you will not be taxed on this amount. 

 However you will be taxed on the net Rs 40,000 according to your income tax slab rate.This exemption is also further subject to limits (see table) depending on the mode of conveyance.

 If I am entitled to a certain sum as LTA but spend more, can I claim the higher amount?

 No. Say in a year, you receive Rs 8,000 as LTA, but spend Rs 50,000 on travel. You can claim exemption only for Rs 8,000.

 How often can I claim LTC?

 It can be availed of only in respect of two journeys performed in a block of four calendar years. This block is not calculated with the start of your employment. The government defines these blocks and the first one began in 1986. The present block period is from 2002 to 2005. Since the calendar year is considered and not the financial year, the period will be from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2005.

 What if I fail to avail of it?

 In case you fail to avail of your LTA, there is a ?carryover? option. Suppose in the block of four years, you never did claim any LTA, you can do so in the calendar year immediately following that block. In such cases, the exemption so availed of will not be counted for purposes of regulating the future exemptions allowable for the succeeding block of four years.

 Can I claim LTC if I travel with my family?

 You can either travel alone or with your family. However, if your family travels without you, no LTA can be claimed. Family includes spouse, children as well as dependent parents, brothers and sisters. In respect of children born on or after October 1, 1998, the exemption will be restricted only to two surviving children unless the birth after one child has resulted in multiple births (twins or triplets).

 Can both spouses claim LTC? 

 If both spouses get LTA benefits, they can claim exemption on LTA from their employers and the benefit for four journeys in one block. They do not have to take the precaution of not travelling twice during the same year. Moreover, they can take the same family members or different ones as long as they stick to the definition of the members for this purpose. However, you and your wife cannot claim LTA twice for the same journey. If both of you take a holiday together and you claim LTA, she cannot.

 Where the journey 

 is by air?

 An amount not exceeding the air economy fare of the national carrier by the 

 shortest route to the place of destination

 Where places of origin of journey and destination are connected by rail

 Any mode of transport other than by air, an amount not exceeding the air-conditioned first class rail fare by the shortest route to the place of 

 destination

 Where the places of 

 origin of journey and 

 destination or part thereof are not 

 connected by rail

 a) Where a recognised 

 public transport system 

 exists, an amount not 

 exceeding the first class 

 or deluxe class fare, as the case may be, on such 

 transport by the shortest route to the place of 

 destination

 b) Where no recognised public transport system 

 exists, an amount equivalent to the air-conditioned first class rail fare, for the 

 distance of the journey by the shortest route, as if the journey had been 

 performed by rail

 Will warrior turns prince of the pulpit

 Calcutta, Aug. 26: Taking a leaf out of the CPMs election management module, Rajendra Singh Lodha took charge of the proceedings at the annual general meeting (AGM) of Birla Corporation today. 

 Long wait for shareholders in the queues, elaborate security arrangement ? around 20 officials from Tollygunge police station and a posse of walkie-talkie-toting private guards ? at the venue and mobilisation of people owing allegiance to Lodha. Everything was done to minimise the chances of things spinning out of control.

 Shareholders democracy is our lifeblood and, believe me, we want to take note of all the well-meaning suggestions, said Lodha, chairman of the MP Birla groups flagship company, while fielding questions from shareholders during the four-hour meeting.

 Following true democratic traditions, all the seven resolutions were put to vote. And the similarity with the CPM came through in the results ? all resolutions were passed with an overwhelming majority of 98.74 per cent. 

 But unlike last year, peace prevailed ? except for a few occasions when some shareholders ran to the pulpit to get their points across ? at Uttam Mancha and its neighbouring areas, where Section 144 of the IPC was clamped to restrict the number of people who can gather at a time.

 While the strategy of weaving a security cover and packing the auditorium with well-wishers did keep away the disturbing elements, the trail of the inheritance controversy followed Lodha. 

 Senior officials from other Birla companies, who led the attack against Lodha in last years AGM, were missing but some trusted family loyalists sneaked in and did their best to needle Lodha.

 You are involved in criminal cases. How can you morally continue as the chairman of the company? demanded a shareholder amid vocal protests from the floor. 

 This is not a political forum to settle scores and earn brownie points. We have grown and the future will be more exciting despite disturbances from vested interests and pin-pricks, promised Lodha. 

 He announced plans to expand Birla Corps clinker capacity by one million tonnes and cement by 1.5 million tonnes at the Satna plant in phases. He explained to shareholders how the company would gain Rs 50 crore in cost savings from the decision to set up power plants. 

 In 2004-05, Birla Corporations turnover grew 15 per cent to Rs 1,342.64 crore.

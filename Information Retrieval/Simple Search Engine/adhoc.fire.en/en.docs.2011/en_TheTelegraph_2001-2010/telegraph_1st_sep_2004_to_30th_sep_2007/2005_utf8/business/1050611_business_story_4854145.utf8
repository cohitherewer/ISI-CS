 Solar power for Orissa villages

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, June 10: The Orissa government has given a go-ahead to a proposal to electrify 1 lakh households in 1200 villages through solar energy at a cost of Rs 350 crore.

 Srei, a major player in infrastructure financing of the power sector, had submitted the proposal for electrification and committed to bring the necessary investment for the state government to provide grid quality light. Srei will provide the finance at an interest of 3 per cent per annum to be repaid in 13 years.

 All the households cannot be electrified through conventional energy. So renewable energy is the answer, state energy minister Suryo Patro told The Telegraph. 

 A high-power committee of the state government will meet tomorrow to stamp its seal of approval on the project, sources said. The state government will repay the Rs 350-crore loan with a Rs 140-crore subsidy given by the Union power ministry and another Rs 210 crore as long-term funding from Rural Electrification Corporation.

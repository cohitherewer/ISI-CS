 ATR keen on ties with Hind Aeronautics

 B. R. SRIKANTH

 Bangalore, Jan. 6: The Toulouse-based Avions de Transport Regional (ATR) today said it plans to revive an agreement signed with Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) for sourcing systems and components for its aircraft.

 ?We are looking at the possibility of reviving manufacturing collaboration with the Indian aviation industry. We have asked for discussions on the agreement with HAL. We are ready to source components from HAL,? ATR CEO Filippo Bagnato said while announcing the sale of 72-seater aircraft to Air Deccan. According to his estimate, Indian domestic airliners would require 100-150 turbo prop aircraft in the next eight to 10 years. ATR?s aircraft are being flown by Indian Airlines, Jet Airways and Air Deccan.

 Bagnato said his company will provide 30 ATR 72-500 aircraft as part of the multi-million dollar deal with Air Deccan. Of the 30 aircraft, 15 will be new while the remaining will be leased, with the delivery schedule spread over five years at the rate of 6-8 aircraft a year.

 An agreement to deliver the new and leased aircraft was signed here today by Bagnato and G. R. Gopinath, managing director of Air Deccan. ?The sticker price for each ATR 72-500 aircraft is $17.6 million. The exact price will be negotiated in consultation with export credit agencies such as Sace Bank of Italy and COFAS of France, who will stand guarantee for 80-85 per cent of the aircraft cost,? Bagnato said. 

 As part of the deal, ATR has agreed to set up a training facility in Bangalore.

 Policy pivot shifts to labour law rejig, FDI

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 9: Labour law reforms and policy changes to attract more foreign investments hold the key to growth, the finance ministry said in its mid-year review of the economy. 

 Left leaders are already at odds with the Congress-led government for trying to push through labour reforms which threaten their trade union vote bank. Issues like foreign direct investment in retail trading and higher doses of FDI in insurance, banking and pension have not gone down well with them either. 

 The review tabled by finance minister P. Chidambaram, however, pointed out there are limits to the ability of the agriculture sector in providing gainful employment to over 600 million people dependant on it ... Industrial growth needs to be maintained at double-digit rates. Manufacturing growth in the first half of the year had been about 9.2 per cent. 

 Industrial growth in the first half had been marred by a disappointing performance in mining and electricity sectors, the report said. It also called for substantive reforms in the coal sector in terms of pricing, foreign direct investment and opening of coal mining to the private sector.

 In the report unveiled today, analysts saw hints of changes Chidambaram is likely to introduce in next years economic reforms package.

 The review is a serious exercise in the finance ministry and stems from internal decisions on which way the government wants to steer the economic policy, said senior finance ministry officials.

 The report said sustaining an 8-10 per cent growth with an investment of 26.3 per cent would be difficult and advocated supplementing domestic savings with foreign savings by attracting more foreign investments.

 The survey did not specify steps to attract foreign investment. However, officials were clear that these included opening up of FDI in financial services, including insurance and pension, besides core sectors like mining, coal and, if possible, retail trading. 

 Actual steps taken by the government will depend on real-politics, but these are our policy prescriptions and it will be up to the government to try and work out a political consensus on these lines, officials said. 

 The buoyancy in the capital markets in the first half of the year was reflected in an increase in IPOs and privately placed debt by companies, the report added.

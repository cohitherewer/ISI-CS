 Mumbai, April 8: Union finance minister P. Chidambaram today asked the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and stock exchanges to formulate a roadmap to prevent manipulation of regional bourses and the sub-broking community by certain ?unscrupulous? debarred brokers.

 The government will take stringent action against such debarred brokers who are ?operating behind the scenes?, Chidambaram said at a seminar on ?The Securities Market, Vision for Development and Regulations? organised by the Association of NSE Members of India.

 ?There are disturbing reports that debarred brokers are misusing regional bourses and sub-brokers behind the scenes. It is necessary for capital market regulators to take action against possible misuse of these parties,? he said.

 Chidambaram added that ?bad brokers will drive away the good ones from the capital market?. Under such circumstances, it was necessary to chalk out a roadmap for sub-brokers, he said.

 The finance minister urged stock exchanges, which have not corporatised, to adhere to the deadline laid down by the market regulator. He also asked the broking community to embrace technology. 

 Sebi chairman M. Damodaran said the number of stock brokers registered on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) has come down to 887 in March 2003 from 1,013 in March 1997.

 He added that this decrease in the numbers is a signal that the capital market is turning into an unattractive business proposition or intense competition is prompting players to withdraw. 

 ?Brokers have to explore business propositions beyond India. This is necessary, if not to conquer but to defend their own existence,? he said.

 While in Mumbai, Chidambaram had a meeting with Reliance vice-chairman and managing director Anil Ambani, the details of which are not known.

 Interest rates

 Chidambaram said he saw no upward pressure on domestic interest rates in the medium-term. 

 The government is confident of managing inflationary pressures despite rising crude oil prices, he added.

 He also said it is up to the cabinet to decide on a hike in petrol prices.

 Tata Steel hunts for coal abroad

 Singapore March 9 (Bloomberg): Tata Steel is planing to buy coal mines in Australia, Indonesia, Mozambique or New Zealand as part of its goal to more than triple steel production to 15 million tonnes.

 The company now produces 4 million tonnes of steel per year. The plants are supplied with coal from its mines in India, deputy managing director T. Mukherjee said here today.

 ?When we go to 15 million tonnes, we will need to secure our raw material supplies, which means we will need to have some coal mines, may be more than one, outside India,? he said. He didn?t say how much Tata Steel plans to spend on coal mines.

 The steel major may produce 15 million tonnes of steel in 2009, one year earlier than planned, Mukherjee said. The company is ?very much on track? with the expansion plan, he added. 

 Tata Steel will seek shareholders? approval on March 24 to raise Rs 5,000 crore to fund its expansion. The company is likely to raise the money through a ?debt-related instrument?, he said, without being more specific.

 The company is expanding the capacity of its 4-million tonne plant in Jamshedpur. It has also announced plans to build a 6-million tonne plant in Orissa.

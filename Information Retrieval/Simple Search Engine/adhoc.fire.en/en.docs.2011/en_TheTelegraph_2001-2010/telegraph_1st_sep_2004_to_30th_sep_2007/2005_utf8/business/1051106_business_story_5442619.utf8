 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 5: The Indian Tea Association has initiated dialogues with the Tea Board and the Union commerce ministry for commissioning a study on domestic consumption of the beverage. At present, 730 million kilograms of tea are consumed within the country. 

 P.T. Siganporia, chairman of Indian Tea Association (ITA), said, ITA along with some FMCG companies have urged the Tea Board to commission a study on the domestic consumption pattern of tea. The commerce ministry is also keen to know how the tea intake is growing in the country. We are currently discussing the ways to go about the study.

 Siganporia was speaking at the seminar on Value Addition to Foods: Tea, organised by the Association of Food Scientists and Technologies (India) here today.

 The knowledge of the correct trend of consumption will help the industry work out a production model.

 Siganporia also stressed the need for tea promotion campaigns based on the health factors and aimed at connecting the domestic consumers. The auction prices of tea for plainer and medium type of teas have been lower, added the ITA chairman. However, he does not expect the exports to go up drastically based on the trend this year.

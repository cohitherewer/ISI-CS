 TCS inks deal with Novo Nordisk

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 19: Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS) today announced that it has entered into a strategic tie-up with Novo Nordisk, a leading pharmaceutical firm that specialises in diabetic care.

 TCS will help set up Novo Nordisks offshore clinical operations service.

 TCS will provide a suite of data management services, which includes designing, capturing and coding of trial data gathered from clinical trials run by Novo Nordisk across the globe. This will be done from TCSs state-of-the-art BPO facility here.

 According to a statement from TCS, Novo Nordisk is developing its outsourcing strategy and has a number of agreements in India.

 TCS won the deal from a group of four contenders, who had to go through Novo Nordisks rigorous selection process. 

 The company was selected for its experience in healthcare as well as its unparalleled project management capability and quality processes. Its ability to provide customers with a comprehensive end-to-end solution was also factored in, TCS said.

 TCS has the ability to understand business processes and structure teams that have the right mix of operational and business professionals, said Milind Kamat, head, TCS BPO Services.

 The companys domain knowledge and data management capabilities will ensure that Novo Nordisk can outsource large groups of trials to a single provider in a low-employee-cost geographic location.

 The deal with Novo Nordisk is expected to enhance TCSs offerings for customers in the healthcare business.

 It is estimated that the market size from outsourcing clinical trial management would be around $1 billion in the next five years. 

 If pharmaceutical companies resort to offshore part of these activities, the savings potential could be in the range of 40 per cent of current costs incurred in capturing data from clinical trials.

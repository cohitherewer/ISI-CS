 Call for low telecom taxes

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 11: The telecom industry wants the government to address issues related to taxes, licence fees and administration to minimise resource shortage that hampers network expansion and investment in rural areas.

 In its recommendations for the budget for 2006-07, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has proposed that the government reduce the tax burden, bring down the licence fees from 7 to 5 per cent and extend the tax holiday for another two years up to 2007.

 The ARPU (average revenue per user) has declined to Rs 390 during the April-June quarter this year. The industry also faces high duties and levies apart from new taxes or introduction of VAT. This results in thin operating margins and inadequate resources to fund network expansion and growth in rural and remote areas, COAI director-general T.V. Ramachandran said.

 Around Rs 60,000 crore have already been invested in the telecom sector in setting up 150 cellular mobile networks covering 4000 towns and cities and over 6000 villages.

 The association feels that the credit against excise facility should be extended to telecom service providers to avail of a credit of 4 per cent additional duty of customs (ACD), which was levied after the basic duty was removed.

 It also says operators should be entitled to Cenvat credit on excise duty and input credit for consumption of fuel used for maintenance and running of networks since telecom is a service.

 The absence of these benefits amounts to a 4.64 per cent increase in cost of equipment maintenance and another 4.64 per cent additional duty to the cost of the SIM (subscriber identity module) card.

 These measures will result in a higher disposable surplus for reinvestment in the business, which will enable faster expansion of service thereby resulting in higher revenues for service providers. This in turn will result in higher licence fees and tax revenues for the government, said Ramachandran.

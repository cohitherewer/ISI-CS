 Corporate storm builds up on the fringe

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Chidambaram: Formula one

 New Delhi, June 27: The fringe benefit tax (FBT) imposed in the budget for 2005-06 had spooked corporate India. 

 The expected uproar had prompted finance minister P. Chidambaram to revisit some of the provisions before the finance bill was eventually passed. 

 Clearly, those changes wont make much difference. In fact, if experts are to be believed, it will be a lot worse. 

 First estimates indicate that India Inc may have to fork out Rs 9,000 crore by way of FBT this year, which will be three times Chidambarams budget estimate of Rs 3,000 crore from the levy. 

 After the brouhaha last February, the finance ministry had said business expenditure on sales promotion, which involves publicity, advertisement (including rentals) of any form in print (journals, catalogues or price lists) or electronic media or transport system would not attract FBT. 

 Corporate bottomlines will surely be eroded, thanks to FBT. Across the board, the impact of FBT on companies will be somewhere between 5.5 to 6 per cent, said Ravi Saxena, managing director, Sodexho Pass India. 

 According to estimates, FBT will lead to an increase of approximately 22 to 25 per cent on the personal income tax liability of an employee as well. 

 During budget 2005-06, the government had expressed its intention of collecting Rs 3,000 crore from FBT, which will be extrapolated into expenses. This will be done at an average tax incidence of 8 per cent. 

 The industry is unanimously of the view that FBT has been drafted diplomatically, and it brings within its ambit the smallest of expenditures that companies incur. 

 Corporate honchos and tax experts were unanimous in their view that FBT would hurt companies at a conference organised by Assocham to discuss the implications of FBT and the corporate strategies that needed to be devised to deal with this impost. 

 The experts at the seminar included Rajiv Anand, associate director of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Sharad Vishvanath, Hewitt Associates-India business consulting leader amongst others. 

 Industry drew comparisons with the service tax which was first introduced in 1997 with 18 items under its purview and generated an annual tax revenue of Rs 410 crore for the government. By financial year 2004-05, revenue collections from the services sector rose to Rs 14,000 crore by widening the tax net to 58 items. 

 A participant in the seminar said, Similarly, the FBT in its present form will prove to be one of the most profiteering areas of tax collection. This is exactly why the finance minister is not ready to take a re-look.

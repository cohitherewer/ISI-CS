 Tata Motors keen to tap overseas potential

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, June 24: The Tatas are planning to set up more production facilities outside India, Tata Motors executive director Ravi Kant said at the inauguration of a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility of Sundaram Clayton. The unit, built at a cost of Rs 58-crore, will manufacture air-break systems for commercial vehicles.

 Tata Motors is keen to tap the overseas transportation business, particularly after having taken over a truck company in Korea and a bus manufacturing plant in Spain, Kant said. 

 He cited the Centres two major road development programmes ? the Golden Quadrilateral project and all-weather roads connecting villages ? as harbingers of big changes in the domestic transportation market. 

 India already has the cost advantage and if we get the quality edge, the country could reach great heights in this field, he said, adding, Tata Motors valued working with companies like Sundaram Clayton.

 This is Sundaram Claytons second plant in Chennai. The TVS group company is a joint venture with Wabco (Westinghouse Air Brake Company), a vehicle control systems business of American Standard Companies. 

 Suresh Krishna, director of TVS amp; Sons and chairman of Sundaram Clayton, said, TVS will always stick to its core competence of manufacturing auto-components. This will pay dividends in the long-run, as the concept of outsourcing is gathering momentum in the US and European Union because of cost pressures there. 

 Sundaram Clayton managing director Venu Srinivasan said the companys new plant at Ambattur has a capacity to produce 1.50 lakh brake systems, including compressors, actuators and valves. Electronic air brake systems will be the next major product, he said, adding that the new plant would be a base for exports of these auto-components.

 Close vigil on LPG supply

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 10: The growth rate in LPG consumption had shot up to 17.5 per cent between April-June 2004 because of a large-scale diversion of subsidised cooking gas to the auto and commercial segments. As a result, the oil companies have been forced to start monitoring supplies to distributors.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar informed the Lok Sabha today that the oil firms had estimated on the basis of long-term trends that on an average, a cylinder of LPG lasts a family of five for 40 days. The huge consumption in cooking gas could not be accounted for by this legitimate consumption and oil companies had started strict scheduling and monitoring of supplies to distributors to prevent this unauthorised diversion of subsidised LPG, he said.

 The minister said the growth rate of LPG consumption had increased from 8.6 per cent in 2002-03 to 13.4 per cent in 2003-04 and then jumped to 17.5 per cent in April-June.

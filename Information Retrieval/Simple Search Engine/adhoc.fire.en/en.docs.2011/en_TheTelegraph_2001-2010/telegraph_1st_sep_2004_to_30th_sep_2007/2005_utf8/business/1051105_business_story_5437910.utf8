 Get Lionel ready to go places

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Calcutta, Nov. 4: Get Lionel India Ltd, a travel company of the KK Birla stable, is poised for a jump in turnover over the next three years with a slew of products lined up for the corporate sector.

 The company hopes to increase its turnover nearly five times to Rs 350 crore in 2008 from Rs 72 crore at the end of last fiscal, chief executive officer Gaurav Sundaram said.

 Get Lionel has soft launched a foreign exchange product last month for its corporate clients. The company expects it to become popular with export-oriented companies and garner $15 million by the end of this fiscal, Sundaram told The Telegraph.

 The product will be formally launched next month.

 The new FX Card will provide the nominees of corporate clients an in-built insurance facility and will enable the card holder to replenish foreign exchange during an extended stay abroad. 

 Get Lionel has already tied up with a leading private sector bank to facilitate foreign exchange advance for its clients, Sundaram said.

 Other products lined up by Get Lionel includes joint venture travel business in Sri Lanka with a leading local partner, establishment of round-the-clock call centre across the country to offer travel-related services and extension of branch network to Pune, Chandigarh and Cochin. 

 The company currently has full-fledged offices in Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chennai.

 A Lionel Business Centre will also be created to service its existing clients, attract new ones as well as use its 5,000 square feet space at Ballard Estate in Mumbais prime business district, Sunbdaram said.

 According to Sundaram, the single-point travel management concept has already resulted in 6 to 7 per cent savings in travel costs for many of its corporate clients.

 Apart from saving travel costs, considered to be the second or third largest controllable expense, Get Lionels thrust on transparency, account management, accountability and timely auditing remained its key business focus, Sundaram said.

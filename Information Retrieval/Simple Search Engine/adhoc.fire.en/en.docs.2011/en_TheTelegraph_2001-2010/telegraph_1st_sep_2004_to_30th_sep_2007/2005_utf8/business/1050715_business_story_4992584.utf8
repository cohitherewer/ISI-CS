 Hyderabad, July 14: The Andhra Pradesh government today asked for a CBI inquiry into the controversial investment in Vashisht Wahan, a firm claiming to be the Indian arm of Volkswagen, and shunted industry minister B. Satyanarayana on corruption charges.

 Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation had deposited Rs 11 crore of public funds in favour of Delhi-based Vashisht Wahan in January. 

 The inquiry will focus on the ?fate? of this money, which was supposed to be used for setting up a car manufacturing plant at Visakhapatnam, said chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy.

 The payment ? towards equity participation amounting to 2 per cent ? was made on the basis of a letter sent by Volkswagen India representative Helmuth Schuster. He had requested immediate payment of euro 2 million of the euro 5 million committed by the state government as equity contribution.

 Reddy expressed confidence that the money can be ?recovered soon?.

 He said both the state government and the Volkswagen team had signed a joint protocol on May 27 as a precursor to the memorandum of understanding that was to be signed after the June 20 meeting of the Volkswagen board.

 However, Schuster was subsequently asked by the German company to resign following charges of fraud and bribery. He is now facing criminal charges in Germany.

 ?Apparently, Schuster ? who was dealing with the state government for the last three years ? has swindled the money. However, we are confident about the safety of the cash and are taking legal opinion on this,? Reddy said.

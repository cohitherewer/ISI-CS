 New Delhi, Dec. 28: A plethora of opportunities will be available for junior and middle-level executives in the coming six months as Indian firms will hire more in these categories than entry levels, TeamLease-Gallup Employment Outlook Survey said in its latest report.

 On an average, only one out of four companies is expected to hire at the entry level, whereas two out of three companies are likely to hire at the junior level (1-3 years of experience), the survey said.

 Four out of five companies forecast an increase in hiring over the next six months.

 The middle level, comprising people with 3-7 years of experience, also has a high demand with 40 per cent firms expecting to hire at this level. Hyderabad and Pune will lead the recruitment drive.

 The percentage of companies expecting to hire at senior levels is lower and does not vary much across cities.

 The employment outlook index, which is the difference in the proportion of respondents reporting an increase in hiring and those reporting a decline, has grown close to 70 per cent.

 Calcutta, which has shown a steady growth in the employment index, has projected an index of 76 per cent.

 The survey forecast a healthy business growth in Mumbai, Delhi, Calcutta and Pune in the next six months.

 It said riding on the economic growth and population statistics, the employment industry in India has witnessed rapid changes. 

 A decreasing ratio of rural-urban employment, higher productivity, growth of new sectors, increased educational and vocational opportunities, the merging of global borders have impacted the structure and growth of employment markets.

 MphasiS mulls buyback

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Sept. 1: Mphasis BFL today informed stock exchanges that its board would meet on September 10 to consider a buyback proposal.

 This is viewed as a confidence building measure after MphasiS BFLs lead investor, Barings India Investments, recently decided to retain its 35 per cent stake in the company. 

 While the announcement did come as a surprise to many in the stock markets, experts said the move is part of the companys plan to instil confidence among its investors and protect its share price.

 However, it needs to be seen how much the company is able to stump up for the buyback as it had made some acquisitions in the recent past.

 On the BSE today, the MphasiS scrip finished at Rs 250.85 after opening at Rs 260 and slipping to an intra-day low of Rs 250.

 Mphasis BFL was in the news recently when Barings decided not to sell its stake in the company, which is managed by Jerry Rao. 

 Hinduja TMT and Temasek Holdings, an investment arm of the Singapore government, were in the fray to acquire Baringss stake.

 After evaluating the merits of the proposals put forth by various companies, Barings had decided not to entertain any of the offers. 

 During the interim period when Barings was in the exit mode, two senior officials of MphasiS, including chief financial officer Ravi Ramu, had resigned. It was, however, pointed out that this had nothing to do with Barings planning to sell its stake.

 MphasiS BFL told stock exchanges that another investor, Winterfall Ltd, has sold its 47.43-lakh shares, or 6 per cent of the share capital, in the company.

 Ramu also sold 86,200 shares through open market transactions. He first sold 25,000 shares on August 25. The following day he offloaded 15,000 shares and on August 29 he sold the rest 46,200 shares.

 In March, the Mphasis BFL group had acquired Eldorado Computing Inc, an US-based healthcare benefits management solutions firm, for $16.5 million in an all-cash deal.

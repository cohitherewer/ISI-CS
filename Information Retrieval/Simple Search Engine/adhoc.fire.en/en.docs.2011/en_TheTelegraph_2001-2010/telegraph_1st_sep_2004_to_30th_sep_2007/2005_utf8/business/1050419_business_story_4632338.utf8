 Export zones yet to stand on own feet

 S. P. S. PANNU

 New Delhi, April 18: The policy turbocharge has failed to ignite the fortunes of the country?s special economic zones, which have seen their share in the overall export basket go up by a mere 0.5 per cent to touch 5.26 per cent during April 2004 to January 2005 from 4.72 per cent during 2003-04. 

 Official statistics with The Telegraph show that exports from SEZs during the April-January (2004-05) period were valued at Rs 14,440 crore compared with Rs 13,854 crore during the entire previous financial year. 

 While there has been an increase in the value of exports over the previous year, there is no evidence of the big leap. These SEZs have been set up on the Chinese pattern but they have not yet picked up the growth momentum of the original model.

 As many as 11 SEZs are currently in operation. These include Falta and Salt Lake in Bengal, Kandla and Surat in Gujarat, Santa Cruz in Mumbai, Cochin, Chennai, Vizag, Indore, Jaipur and Noida in Uttar Pradesh. 

 Foreign investment, including those by NRIs, worth Rs 423 crore has flowed into the units located in these operational SEZs. Around 98,620 people are employed in the SEZs.

 As part of its efforts to boost SEZs, the government has allowed 100 per cent foreign direct investment (FDI) through the automatic route for manufacturing units located in these zones. Duty-free import of goods for the development, operation and maintenance of SEZs has been permitted and various tax exemptions have been extended to them. Supplies from the domestic tariff area to SEZ units are treated on a par with physical exports and are exempted from service tax and central sales tax.

 Offshore banking units have also been allowed to operate in these zones in order to smoothen international financial transactions.

 The government has also given its approval for setting up another 33 SEZs. These are coming up in the private, joint sectors or entirely on the initiative of the state governments. Salt Lake electronic city in Calcutta and Kulpi are the proposed new SEZs for Bengal that figure on this list. Paradip and Gopalpur in Orissa, Ranchi and Vizag have also got the governments approval. Another five SEZs have been proposed for Tamil Nadu and six for Gujarat.

 The government also intends to enact a more liberal legislation for SEZs covering all aspects of their establishment, operation and fiscal regime. 

 The objective is to have more liberal labour laws as well so that these units can function in an environment that will enable them to compete in the global market. 

 The group of ministers is already reported to have recommended the proposal for the introduction of a special economic zones bill in Parliament.

 Double-whammy for jute industry

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Sackful of woes

 Calcutta, Nov. 6: Jute industry is hurtling towards fresh trouble. 

 Illegal import of jute bags from Nepal had been troubling the industry for quite sometime and now it is feared that these bags might go into the central purchase of packing rabi crop which is due to begin in December.

 Industry sources said about 200 tonnes of jute bags, both B Twills ? used for packing food grains ? and A Twills, for packing sugar, are entering the country from Nepal. Import of jute bags from Nepal attracts a 16 per cent customs duty. The duty is never paid as these bags never have the ?country of origin? mark.

 Sources allege that a number of small jute mills have come up in the neighbouring country, some by the city-based established jute entrepreneurs. These mills have been smuggling out raw jute from Bihar and north Bengal and bringing finished bags into India. 

 They fear that the domestic entrepreneurs could even blend the imported bags with those locally made for supplying to the Food Corporation of India and other government procurement agencies.

 The use of imported jute bags for packing food grains is completely banned under the Jute Packaging Materials Act. 

 At the home front, jute mills have declined to pay increased dearness allowance from November and this may force another labour strife. Indian Jute Mills Association has asked its members not to pay increased dearness allowance due from this month.

 Pending the official announcement of the increased consumer price index, the industry estimates that the rise would be close to 70 points. At this rate, the additional outgo per worker would be around Rs 280.

 The IJMA circular was issued even as the state labour department has declared the move ?illegal?.

 But the association noted that the mills would go ahead with the freeze on the DA payment as the unions and the labour department had done nothing to implement the productivity-linked wage system. Payment of increased DA was agreed last year.

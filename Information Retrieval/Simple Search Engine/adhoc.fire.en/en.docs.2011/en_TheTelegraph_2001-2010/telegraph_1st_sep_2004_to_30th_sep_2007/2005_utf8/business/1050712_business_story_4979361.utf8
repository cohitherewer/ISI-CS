 Deal puts VNU on top

 Amsterdam, July 11 (Reuters): Dutch publisher VNU NV will buy healthcare data provider IMS Health Inc for 5.8 billion euros ($6.9 billion), strengthening its position as the worlds biggest market research company, the companies said on Monday.

 The deal adds the healthcare market to VNUs Nielsen media and AC Nielsen consumer-goods market intelligence and marks a step in the transformation of the former Dutch newspaper and magazine publisher into a US-based business information group. The value of the deal is almost equal to VNUs market capitalisation of about 6 billion euros. VNU shares opened 2.8 per cent lower on the news.

 This merger of two industry leaders gives us the scale and capabilities to meet growing client demand for the must-have market intelligence that drives critical business decisions, VNU chief executive Rob van den Bergh said.

 The deal makes a lot of sense for both shareholders ?together we will grow faster, taking advantage of great opportunities to work together, as well as running our worldwide operations more efficiently, he said.

 VNU will pay $11.25 in cash plus 0.60415 VNU shares for each IMS share, which it said represented a 16 per cent premium over the average price of IMS stock over the last 30 days. IMS has some 225.59 million shares outstanding and VNU will have to issue some 137 million new shares on top of its current number of 253.76 million shares ? a dilution of some 54 per cent.

 IMS tracks over 1 million brands of prescription drugs daily, covering more than 70 per cent of all pharmaceutical sales transactions worldwide in more than 100 countries and more than 90 per cent of sales in the US. Pharmaceutical companies use its information to monitor drug sales and market shares of their rivals.

 VNU and IMS said they expected annualised synergies of at least 110 million euros, including cost savings, by 2008 and said the deal will be accretive to VNUs cash earnings per share in the first year.

 We are absolutely confident we can achieve at least 85 million euros in costs savings and 135 million in new revenues by the third year of our merger, van den Bergh told reporters in a conference call.

 VNU provides business-to-business information through trade publications such as Billboard, The Hollywood Reporter, Computing and Intermediair, and also has a significant presence in online media.

 VNU, which said its organic revenue growth was 6 per cent in the first half of 2005, said it planned to initiate a share repurchase of up to 500 million euros of its common shares, funded from existing resources.

 The merged firm will trade on the Euronext Amsterdam and the New York Stock Exchange, with a full listing of its American depository receipts on the NYSE at the time of closing. Its board will be headed by van den Bergh, with IMS CEO David Carlucci as deputy CEO and chief operating officer.

 VNU said it has in place a fully committed bridge facility of 2.5 billion euros from ABN AMRO Bank NV, Credit Suisse First Boston and Deutsche Bank AG for incremental cash funding to complete the deal.

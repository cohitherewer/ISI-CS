 Calcutta, Oct. 18: Bridge and Roof Company is aiming at a Rs 1,000-crore turnover in the next three years on the back of a financial restructuring package put in place by the Centre.

 The company, a 100 per cent government-owned unit under the ministry of heavy industries, will invest Rs 105 crore in the next five years to upgrade its machines and infrastructure.

 Bridge and Roof, which works in the construction sector, will get Rs 60 crore from the government and raise Rs 45 crore through internal accruals.

 The company posted a turnover of Rs 466 crore in 2004-05 with a net profit of Rs 0.98 crore.

 It is looking at a turnover of Rs 525 crore this fiscal with a profit before tax of Rs 5 crore.

 We are aiming at bigger projects now as the companys net worth will increase substantially after the restructuring, company managing director P.K. Biswas said in Calcutta today.

 The restructuring involves converting government loans of Rs 11.01 crore to equity. The Centre has also waived accrued interest of Rs 3,191 crore on government loans.

 Moreover, the Centre will infuse Rs 60 crore to purchase modern equipment for projects and the Howrah workshop. While 50 per cent will come as government equity, the remaining 50 per cent will be treated as loan.

 After the restructuring, the net worth of the company will rise substantially, enabling the company to bid for bigger projects, director (finance) Mukesh Jha said.

 The company has maintained a good track record in the past, but it has slipped into bad time of late.

 An unprecedented rise in steel prices has dented its profitability as it could not pass the burden on to the customer. 

 Going forward, the company will bid more aggressively for projects both in the private as well as in the public sector.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Note to Bharti

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today directed Bharti Cellular Ltd to open its allotted mobile switching centre codes to all service providers.

 The department of telecommunications (DoT) allots mobile switching centre codes to operators so that they can access interconnect calls from other operators. 

 Many operators have alleged that Bharti Cellular did not open these codes quickly in its networks, resulting in non-completion of calls.

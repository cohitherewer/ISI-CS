 Pantaloon to buy Indus League

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 4: Pantaloon Industries will acquire the Bangalore-based Indus League Clothing for Rs 16 crore.

 Pantaloon will acquire a 68.29 per cent stake of Indus League from ICICI Venture Funds Management. 

 The Pantaloon board has approved in principle the proposal to invest up to Rs 24.09 crore to acquire around 1.19 crore shares of Indus League Clothing from ICICI Venture Funds Management, the company informed the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 Pantaloon will issue 1.20 crore redeemable preference shares of Rs 20 each on private placement to ICICI Venture Funds in lieu of this acquisition, the company added. 

 Sources said these preference shares can be redeemed after three years. While the enterprise value of Indus League has been put at around Rs 24 crore, the value of the 68 per cent stake is put at over Rs 16 crore.

 Pantaloon Industries manufactures and markets blended yarn fabrics for suiting and trousers under the brand name of Pantaloons Expression. It also supplies fabrics to Pantaloon Retail India Ltd (PRIL) and other ready-made garment manufacturers. It posted a net profit of Rs 38.6 lakh on net sales of Rs 23 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2004.

 The acquisition is expected to be a win-win situation for both the companies as Pantaloon Industries can now use the large distribution platform of group company PRIL. For Pantaloon, it would mean the bringing the Scullers and Indigo Nation brands into its fold.

 ?While both these brands began well initially, their growth suffered later due to the lack of a good distribution network. These problems can now be rectified as we have a much wider retail presence in the country,? sources added.

 Indus League Clothing was promoted by eight professionals led by Sriram Srinivasan, the former president of Madura Garments.

 Oil duo to bid jointly for Libyan blocks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Oil India (OIL) are gearing up to jointly bid for exploration blocks in Libya.

 Libya is offering 20 oil exploration blocks in the next round, which is coming up soon, an IOC official told The Telegraph.

 We will bid for one or two blocks in the round, he added.

 The IOC-OIL combine already has two exploration blocks in the Sirte basin in Libya, for which they had bid in the earlier rounds.

 The petroleum ministry wants OIL to play a greater role in oil explorations so that it is not confined to the Northeast. It had devised a strategy to club the financial muscle of IOC with the upstream expertise of OIL to strengthen the countrys presence in the oil sector. 

 However, with soaring crude costs and the domestic prices of petroleum products being kept on hold, IOCs finances have taken a beating. 

 The amount to be spent on acquiring exploration blocks is much smaller than that needed for buying a discovered oilfield. ONGC has also acquired some exploration blocks in Libya, considered to be an oil-rich area.

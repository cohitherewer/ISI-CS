 Mumbai, Feb. 3: State Bank of India (SBI) has zeroed in on the Mauritius-based Indian Ocean International Bank (IOIB) where it will pick up a 51 per cent stake.

 The country?s largest commercial bank will also take over the management control of the Mauritian bank, SBI informed the stock exchanges today.

 Senior SBI officials, including chairman A. K. Purwar, were not available for comment. However, sources said the details of the deal will be made public soon.

 The acquisition of IOIB is part of a strategic move to expand SBI?s presence in the international arena. Others like ICICI Bank have also firmed up plans to expand overseas by setting up branches and opening representative offices. 

 This is largely being done at a time when India Inc is also taking the inorganic route to make their presence felt globally.

 While details pertaining to the size of IOIB are sketchy at this stage, sources said the mid-sized bank has a network of 10 branches catering to companies and retailers. So far, SBI?s presence in Mauritius has been through SBI International Mauritius, an offshore bank.

 SBI has been looking at Mauritius to capitalise on the sizeable number of citizens of Indian origin. The island state is also famous for industries like textiles, tourism and retail. In addition, SBI feels the country could be a gateway to other nations.

 Till last year, SBI had 54 offices spread across 31 countries. The bank plans to take the number to 70 offices covering 36 countries by the end of this financial year.

 SBI has recently opened offices in Sydney, Muscat and Chittagong. It has also set up a full-fledged bank in Russia and a branch in Oman.

 Last year, Purwar had said the bank has ambitious plans to increase its presence in the international markets and over the next two years, it is looking at its global operations in a focused manner. 

 This is expected to see the contribution of SBI?s overseas operations jumping to 15 to 20 per cent of its bottomline in the next two to three years, up from around 6 per cent.

 Purwar has indicated that the bank?s focus areas will be Asia and Africa.

 The SBI chief has also indicated that the bank will leave no stone unturned in providing customer convenience in these countries. The bank plans to set up its own ATMs to enhance its service to customers and later inter-link all such ATMs in different countries.

 IOIB, which is listed on the Mauritius Stock Exchange, was founded in 1978 and has about 150 employees on its rolls.

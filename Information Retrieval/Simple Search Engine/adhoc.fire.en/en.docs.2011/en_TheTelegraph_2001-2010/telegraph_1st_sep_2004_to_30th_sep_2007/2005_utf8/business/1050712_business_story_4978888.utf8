 Indian Airlines to augment fleet

 New Delhi, July 11: The government today said Indian Airlines (IA) would take on lease 12 wide-bodied aircraft and six turbo-prop ATRs to increase its fleet size. It is also evaluating taking 10 A320s on lease. 

 The airline is battling to regain its market share, which has dropped to 38 per cent from 65 per cent in 2004. 

 The main reason for the decline in market share is its fleet, which remained static while other airlines grew.

 The government plans to allow IA to buy up to 43 Airbuses, but controversies surrounding aircraft prices have delayed the firming up of the contract.

 IA plans to buy a mix of Airbus-319s, Airbus-320s and Airbus-321s, which are to be delivered over a period of four years between 2005 and 2009. In the interim period, the government wants IA to take these aircraft on lease.

 Indian Airlines has told a parliamentary consultative committee on civil aviation that it plans to have a dedicated freighter operation by converting its B737 aircraft into freighters.

 Apart from this, it is also planning to join a global airline, the state-owned carrier told the committee. IA would benefit by way of getting access to new markets through code sharing, enhancing its global image, upgrading technology and service standards.

 Stiff competition from rival airlines has forced Indian Airlines to expand operations immediately by taking aircraft on lease. New private airlines, including several start-ups, have committed to buy some 220 aircraft of various shapes and sizes for a combined price tag of over $18 billion.

 Attracted by a fast growing economy and rising income levels, airlines are expanding services. Analysts estimate that over the next five years, passenger traffic is set to grow 20 per cent annually.

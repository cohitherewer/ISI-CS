 Trai suggests law to ban unwanted calls

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 No, thanks

 New Delhi, May 5: The telecom regulator today asked the government to take legal measures to stop unwanted telemarketing calls.

 This is the first initiative taken by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) to tackle the menace of unwanted calls from telemarketers. 

 A petition against such calls is already lying before the Supreme Court. However, the Trai move will certainly bolster the case and provide some respite to telephone customers who are often harassed by cold callers.

 The telecom regulator has also suggested that this could be done by excluding those subscribers who are unwilling to see their telephone numbers printed or appear in the directory services that the operators will have to publish. 

 However, the government has not yet responded to the suggestions made by Trai.

 A senior telecom expert said, ?Only legislative measures can stop telemarketing calls. However, the exclusion of unwilling customers from directory services is a useless suggestion and it is very naive of the regulator to think that data thieves depend on telephone directories.?

 Pawan Duggal, a senior advocate and an expert on cyber law, said, ?There is a need for establishing a parallel directory of Do not call as it exists in the US. Under the system of Do not call, the telephone subscriber can ask the operator to ban certain type/category of calls. The operator has to maintain a directory of such numbers which cannot be accessed by others and disturb their subscribers. quot;

 The telecom regulator today submitted its recommendations on issues relating to publication of telephone directories and directory enquiry services to the government.

 Directory services are general public utility services. However, a telephone directory at present is available only for the fixed line customers of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd. Trai has suggested an integrated telephone directory for fixed line customers.

 Trai in its recommendation has said that quot;the incumbent operators, BSNL and MTNL, will publish the printed integrated telecom directory of fixed line customers and other operators will compensate them for the cost of publication of the directory, based on their number of entries. quot;

 Sources in telecommunications ministry said, quot;We will examine the suggestion. The board of both BSNL and MTNL will take up the issue. It is a good suggestion but private operators should also be willing to participate in it voluntarily.?

 An integrated directory of all mobile customers, too, has been suggested but Trai has observed that it is not possible at present to print such an integrated directory for mobile customers.

 quot;However, each cellular operator meanwhile may publish printed telephone directory of their subscribers at individual circle level,? the Trai recommended. It added, ?The cellular mobile directory should contain entries of only those customers who have explicitly given their consent. quot;

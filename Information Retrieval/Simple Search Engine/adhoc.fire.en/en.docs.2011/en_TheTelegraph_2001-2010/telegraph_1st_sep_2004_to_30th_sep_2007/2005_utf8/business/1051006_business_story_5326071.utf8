 Detractors set to join VAT regime

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: The BJP-ruled states, which have not implemented the value-added tax system so far, are likely to opt for the new regime next year as the Union government has indicated that it will cut central sales tax by half to 2 per cent and fully compensate states for any losses suffered. 

 We are hopeful that other states will join next year, Asim Dasgupta, chairman of the empowered committee of state finance ministers on VAT, said after a meeting here today.

 Uttaranchal will be joining the VAT regime from October while Jharkhand is getting ready to join by January next year. We have drafted a VAT bill which will be introduced in the state assembly if it meets in December. Otherwise an ordinance will be issued for implementing VAT from January, Raghubar Das, finance minister of Jharkahnd said.

 Das, who indicated that other BJP states too may sign up, said his state government took the decision after consulting central BJP leaders. BJP ruled states had earlier shied away from VAT, claiming that there was no clear roadmap for phasing out central sales tax and that there were too many glitches. 

 Jharkhand officials claimed that their decision was prompted by the Centres move to bring down central sales tax to 2 per cent by April next with full compensation for any losses suffered by the states. 

 Some 21 states which have joined the VAT bandwagon reported a 16 per cent growth in tax revenues in the first five months of the current fiscal, far higher than their previous record. 

 Dasgupta said, We will meet the chief ministers of BJP-ruled states by the middle of next month. Then only, we will be able to know their decision about implementing vat.

 The West Bengal finance minister will also be visiting Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, two heavyweight non-BJP ruled states that had opted out of the VAT regime, for what many observers felt were political reasons, though the states had cited unrest by traders as the main cause.

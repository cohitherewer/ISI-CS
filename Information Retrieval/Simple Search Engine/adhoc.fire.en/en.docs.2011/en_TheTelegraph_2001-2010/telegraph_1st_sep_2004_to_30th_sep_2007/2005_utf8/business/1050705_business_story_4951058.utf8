 Tata Tele, Korean major in final talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 4: Tata Teleservices is at an advanced stage of negotiations with South Korea Telecom for a strategic partnership. While the Tatas admitted that they were in talks with SK Telecom and a few others, they declined to reveal details saying that the company is yet to ink a deal.

 The deal with SK Telecom, which will open up the South Korean telecom market, will help spur the next round of expansion for the Tata group company. 

 SK Telecom had earlier said it is keen on entering emerging markets with good business potential as its local turf was getting saturated. The Tatas have been in talks with the South Korean company since last year and the negotiations are believed to be at an advanced stage now.

 The markets have already got a whiff of a deal brewing as the shares of Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra), the only listed telecom company under the Tatas, surged to an intra-day high of Rs 32 and ended the day at Rs 30.85, registering a 14.68 per cent gain from Fridays close of Rs 26.90.

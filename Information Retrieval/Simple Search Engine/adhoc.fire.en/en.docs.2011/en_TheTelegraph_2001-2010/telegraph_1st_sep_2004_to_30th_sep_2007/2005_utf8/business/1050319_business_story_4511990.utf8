 US gains for ICICI Bank 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 It?s a rush

 Mumbai, March 18: ICICI Bank has priced its sponsored American Depository Share (ADS) offering at $21.11 per share. Close to 38.3 million local shares were converted into 19.2 million ADS in a $405-million transaction.

 Each ADS represents two underlying shares of the bank. The offer, which constitutes over 5 per cent of the bank?s paid-up capital, will increase the ADS holding to around 27 per cent from 21.74 per cent for the period ended December 31, 2004. 

 The pricing is at a premium of 18 per cent on the closing domestic share price on March 11, the last date for tendering of shares. 

 The offering was oversubscribed four times. Around 19.2 million ADS equivalent to 38.4 million shares were sold. The joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners had the option of purchasing another 2.9 million ADS, which is equivalent to 5.8 million equity shares.

 The proceeds of the offering, net of expenses, will be paid to the selling shareholders. A total of 62.1 million shares were tendered by the shareholders against the maximum offer size of 44.2 million. An official from the bank added that while retail shareholders and foreign institutional investors (FIIs) participated in the offering, the maximum tenders came from the latter. 

 For the third quarter ended December 31, 2004, institutional investors held 65.99 per cent of the banks equity, while the remaining was shared among the public at 6.95 per cent, private corporate bodies 4.76 per cent and NRIs/OCBs 0.51 per cent.

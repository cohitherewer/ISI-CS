 Ruias keen to buy out Max Tele, IL amp;FS 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 28: The Essar group is wooing the two remaining investors holding minor stakes in the Hutch-Essar joint venture to sell their shares in its favour.

 Analjit Singh-led Max Telecom holds a residual stake after the company sold its controlling stake to Hutch many years ago. 

 At that time, the regulations had stipulated that the original promoter should hold a minimum 10 per cent in the company. As a result, Max Telecom was stuck with a 10 per cent stake, which slowly dwindled as the equity capital rose through a series of acquisitions and fresh investments. 

 Max Telecom and Il amp;FS hold a 3.16 per cent stake in the Hutch-Essar joint venture, which the Essar group wants to buy. 

 We are talking to them, Essar officials said. However, they are tightlipped on the progress of the deliberations.

 Merchant bankers are not involved in the deal as the parties concerned are negotiating directly.

 Max telecom has a 1.8 per cent stake and the rest is with Il amp;FS. They declined to divulge details on the pricing, although industry sources said the talks are at an advanced stage. 

 Following the acquisition, Ruias stake in the JV would go up to about 33.4 per cent from 30.43 per cent. Hutch-Essar is present in 13 telecom circles in the country.

 A couple of months ago, the Essar group had acquired a 64 per cent stake in BPLs mobile operations for $1.1 billion, for which the group has now entered into a deal with Hutch-Essar for selling BPLs stake.

 Earlier, Max India had said it would liquidate its share in the telecom business by divesting its less than 2 per cent stake in Hutchison India.

 The acquisition of minority investors stake will benefit the Essar group as Hutch-Essar is planning to issue an IPO shortly. To facilitate this, it has consolidated its operations.

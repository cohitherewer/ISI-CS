 Bangalore, Oct. 19: Biocon Ltd has posted a net profit of Rs 82 crore during the April-September period, a dip of 22 per cent from Rs 105 crore recorded in the first half of the previous year.

 The income from consolidated sales increased by 4 per cent to Rs 375 crore from Rs 360 crore in the first half of 2004-05. Though the operating profit fell by 8 per cent, the company was able to maintain a healthy profit after tax (PAT) margin of 22 per cent. The operating results were largely affected by challenging pricing conditions in the European statins market. A higher effective tax charge also led to a greater erosion of PAT. However, we have excellent growth drivers and are confident of delivering healthy operating margins for the full year, chairperson Kiran Mazumdar Shaw said. 

 Sequentially, the net profit in the second quarter (July-September) rose 13 per cent to Rs 44 crore from Rs 39 crore registered in the first quarter (April-June) of 2005-06. Similarly, consolidated revenue increased by 15 per cent to Rs 202 crore from Rs 176 crore.

 This year, the growth will be flat. But next year, we will hit the market with bio pharma products and we will be more profitable, Shaw said.

 The companys application for setting up a Biocon park in the special economic zone (SEZ) has been approved by the Karnataka government.

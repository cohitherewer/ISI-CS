 Tata Steel profit surges 99% to Rs 890 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 20: A robust demand and encouraging prices have helped Tata Steel double its third-quarter net profit. 

 The company has posted a 99 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 890.51 crore compared with Rs 447.17 crore in the corresponding previous period.

 Total income (net of excise) increased to Rs 3765.09 crore against Rs 2658.27 crore in the same period last year.

 Revenue from the steel business rose to Rs 3311.47 crore from Rs 2426.42 crore, while that from ferro alloys and minerals jumped to Rs 393.90 crore (Rs 168.80 crore).

 Managing director B. Muthuraman said the company maintained a gross saleable steel production of 1.05 million tonnes compared with 1.04 million tonnes during the corresponding period last year. 

 Apart from the superior product mix, the good performances of other profit centres also contributed to the strong numbers during the period.

 The company gained market share in focus segments and, in some cases, Tata Steels share was as high as 57 per cent.

 Revenues from branded products like Tata Shaktee, Tiscom and Tata Steelium also increased to Rs 2,387 crore during the nine months to December, he added.

 Contribution of the cold-rolled segment will jump to 30 per cent from the existing 27 per cent this quarter, while the share of long products will also gain.

 Muthuraman said the company will focus on raising hot metal production, balancing the increase in costs and improving the product mix, apart from completing NatSteels integration process.

 On the steel industry, he said consolidation will gain in momentum, scrap availability will be constrained, even as iron ore demand will rise. Damodaran sees demand for steel increasing with a shift from developed nations to populous nations like China.

 On the medium term plans of Tata Steel, he said the company will be present in many locations and have a global presence in auto and construction. While a capacity of 15 million tonnes is forecast, the plan is also to maximise potential at Jamshedpur, move up the value chain, establish capacities beyond Jamshedpur and expand the minerals business into a global entity. 

 The company is planning an expansion programme at Jamshedpur, apart from setting up a six-million-tonne greenfield project at Kalinanagar in Orissa.

 The board will raise Rs 5000 crore largely through debt, which will be used to expand Tata Steels presence both in India and abroad.

 DoT faces heat over unpaid spectrum bills

 New Delhi, Dec. 28: The department of telecommunication has been found guilty of not facilitating the payment of more than Rs 1,245 crore to the defence ministry for the spectrum vacated by the latter in 1998-99.

 Spectrum or airwaves on which voice and data sent from mobile phones travel are a scarce resource and the defence ministry holds a substantial portion of these airwaves. 

 The telecom department (DoT) is yet to pay about Rs 345 crore to the defence ministry for the spectrum it vacated. The spectrum was re-allocated to telecom operators who where allowed to migrate from the licence fee regime to a revenue sharing system.

 In addition, the DoT has also not facilitated the paperwork for the disbursement of Rs 900 crore to help defence establishments switch to new and spectrum-efficient equipment.

 The parliamentary standing committee on information technology has taken DoT to task for the delay. ?The committee urges the DoT to take up the matter at an appropriate level and with a sense of utmost urgency,? it said.

 It has also pointed out that without the reworking of defence networks and applications involving major spectral and financial compensation and alternate spectrum, it may be difficult on the part of the defence ministry to release additional spectrum.

 The panel has also asked the DoT to co-ordinate with the ministry to create a Defence Interest Zone that will help identify and categorise spectrum bands for defence and commercial purposes.

 ?The government should create conditions for the formulation of a defence band. Once such a band is formed, besides other benefits, the waiting period for assignment of frequencies will reduce considerably. There will be no need for continuous co-ordination, vacation and migration, which are time consuming,? the panel said.

 It has suggested that the experiences of the US, UK, France and Germany could give some clue about the formation of the defence band. The band can help better planning, procurement and development of equipment by both defence and industry, it added.

 A senior Telecom Commission member said, ?We have already started the work on the disbursement of payments for spectrum vacated by the defence. But the panel seems to have missed out that it involves other ministries and departments. There are limitations, which we have to respect. The allocation of future spectrum to operators would not be stalled because of the points raised by the panel.?

 ?The formation of defence band has been supported by us and we will soon take it up with other stakeholders,? he added.

 Private telecom operators have supported the move to set up the Defence Interest Zone at the earliest. This will help them get the much-needed spectrum without delay.

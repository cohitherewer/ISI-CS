 Numaligarh pipeline on track

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Twists and turns

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: With the finance ministry throwing its weight behind the petroleum ministry on the Numaligarh-Siliguri pipeline, the objections raised by the railways are likely to be swept aside and the project may sail through the cabinet soon. 

 The railway ministry has not given up its fight, though. It has sent a note of objections to the cabinet. The ministry contends that it has drawn up a plan to invest Rs 10,000 crore to make the railway network better in the Northeast, which will enable it to evacuate Numaligarh Refinerys products. Hence, the pipeline would not be required. 

 It fears that the railways will lose the lucrative petroleum products business once the pipeline comes up. So far it has succeeded in delaying the project by three months.

 However, the railways have lost its ground as the finance ministry and the Planning Commission both have approved the proposed pipeline as being economically viable and in the national interest.

 A petroleum ministry official told The Telegraph that when the break-up of the investment plan was obtained from the railways, it revealed that only Rs 800 crore of this investment was for the gauge conversion of the Numaligarh-Siliguri section. The rest is related to construction of bridges and laying rail lines that are nowhere near the pipeline route.

 Numaligarh Refinery has a capacity of 3 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) but has been operating only at 2.1 mtpa as the railways have repeatedly failed to provide an adequate number of wagons and meet the target in evacuating the products of the refinery, pointed out the petroleum ministry official.

 This led to excessive stock piling at the storage tanks of the refinery at times. Even the refinery has to be put on slow mode or even stopped completely during the monsoon when railway operations are thrown completely out of gear due to the flooding of tracks.

 The railway ministry argues that there is a single line running in the Northeast which limits the number of trains that can be run on this route. Besides, it has to give priority to transportation of foodgrains over other products.

 The pipeline will provide Numaligarh Refinery with an efficient, all-weather, transport system, enabling it to operate at full capacity. The petroleum ministry has pointed out that with the additional output of 0.9 mtpa, Siliguri would develop into a huge depot from where the railways would carry the petroleum products to the rest of the country. The freight earnings of the railways on account of the Numaligarh Refinery products would go up from Rs 312 crore at present to Rs 350 crore. 

 Pipelines are considered the most efficient way of transporting petroleum products the world-over. India is also following this trend and pipelines are being laid along the routes on which the railways have been transporting petroleum goods.

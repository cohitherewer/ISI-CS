 Crude comes tantalisingly close to all-time high level

 Oil on the boil 

 London, March 9 (Reuters): Oil prices held close to $55 a barrel on Wednesday, within sight of all-time highs, as late wintry blasts in the United States reignited demand and a tumbling dollar drew more investors into energy markets.

 US light crude for prompt-month April delivery traded up two cents to $54.61, just over a dollar below record highs of $55.67 hit in October last year. May and June delivery crude touched contract highs above that level on Tuesday.

 Britain?s Brent crude was up two cents at $52.86, having set a second record high in four sessions on Tuesday at $53.30. 

 ?It is cold weather and a weak dollar that is encouraging market participants to push up the price,? said Tetsu Emori, chief strategist at Mitsui Bussan Futures in Tokyo. ?We have to look at the currency markets rather than the oil fundamentals.?

 Forecasters predicted the fresh US cold snap to last into the weekend, boosting heating oil demand in the Midwest and the world?s largest market for heating oil ? the Northeast.

 That demand may strain US heating oil inventories that are running 8 per cent below last year, dealers said.

 Analysts expected US distillate stockpiles, which include heating oil, to have fallen by 1.3 million barrels in the seven days to March 4, the seventh consecutive fall.

 But analysts expected crude stocks to rise for the fourth-straight week, climbing 1.8 million barrels and keeping a healthy surplus compared to the same period in 2004.

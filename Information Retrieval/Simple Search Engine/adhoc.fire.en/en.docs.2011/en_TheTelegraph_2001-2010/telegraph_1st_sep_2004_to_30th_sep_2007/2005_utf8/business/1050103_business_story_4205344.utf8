 IT growth seen at 22%

 New Delhi, Jan. 2 (PTI): The domestic IT industry is likely to grow 21.7 per cent in 2005, becoming the fastest-growing market in the Asia-Pacific region, International Data Corporation India said today.

 IDC India, which gave top 10 predictions relevant for the ICT market for 2005, said Vietnam and China will follow India in the IT market growth.

 The IT spending growth rate will be the lowest in Japan at 1.8 per cent.

 ?The growth in India in 2005 comes on the back of rising corporate profits, improvement in macroeconomic parameters (both globally and domestic) and heightened business confidence,? the research firm said.

 With mobility, convergence and IT management driving the market in 2005, the high growth categories in 2005 will be notebooks, smart handheld devices, inkjet MFDs, security, network and system management and information access and delivery software and IT outsourcing.

 ?All the above categories will witness more than 30 per cent growth over 2004,? IDC India said.

 In the domestic ICT spending arena, BPO and IT services will be the highest-growing verticals.

 Worldwide IT spending will continue to grow moderately in 2005 at 6.1 per cent, based on assumptions of a slightly cooler world economy, a mild rebound in western Europe, continued high oil prices, and the same general level of unrest in the world, IDC said.

 Driving the downside would be overheated demand for energy, higher interest rates, and at least one major wild card shock, the research firm said in a report.

 By sector, the strongest growth is likely to be in infrastructure software (including security), handheld devices, network equipment, and outsourcing services. The PC/server upgrade cycle will be in full swing until the end of 2005.

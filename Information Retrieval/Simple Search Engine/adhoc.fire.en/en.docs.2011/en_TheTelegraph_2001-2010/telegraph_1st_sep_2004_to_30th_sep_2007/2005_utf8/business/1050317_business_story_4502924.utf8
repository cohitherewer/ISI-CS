 Infotech, mining to stay on exempt list

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 16: The government today clarified that foreign investment proposals in the information technology sector, investments by multinational financial institutions and in the mining sector, for same area or mineral, that were out of the purview of the earlier Press Note 18 would continue to enjoy this exemption under the new guidelines issued under Press Note 1 on January 12 this year. 

 Under Press Note 18, foreign companies in joint ventures had to take a no-objection certificate from their Indian partners and then seek government permission for making further investment in the country. However, infotech, mining and financial institutions were exempted from this provision of Press Note 18. 

 The government had scrapped Press Note 18 and replaced it with the more liberal Press Note 1 this year which also accords the earlier exemption to these three sectors. 

 The government further clarified that the guidelines of Press Note 1 (2005) make it clear that prior government approval for new proposals would be required only in cases where the foreign investor has an existing joint venture, technology transfer or trademark agreement in the ?same field? subject to provisions of para 2 (i) of the press note. 

 The definition of the ?same field? continues to remain the same as the earlier four digit national industrial classification issued under Press Note 10 of the 1999 series. 

 Joint ventures existing on January 12, 2005 would be treated as ?existing joint ventures? under the new guidelines.

 Growth seen at 7.5%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug 17: The government hopes to top last years GDP growth rate of 7 per cent and take it to 7.5 per cent.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram said today that with all three sectors, farm, industry and services, performing better GDP growth was expected to be robust. 

 North Block officials added that the government was banking on a GDP growth rate nearer to the 7.5 per cent mark. 

 Chidambaram pointed out that India had achieved a 6.9 per cent GDP growth last fiscal despite poor farm sector performance. 

 Asserting that reforms are on track, he said: Reforms is a step that accelerates growth, investment and FDI. The figures are there to see. Even the sensex has crossed the 7,700-mark and bank credit growth is higher than last year. 

 The sensex is going up like the Russian pole-vaulter Isin Dayeva, he said, referring to the bull phase in the market.

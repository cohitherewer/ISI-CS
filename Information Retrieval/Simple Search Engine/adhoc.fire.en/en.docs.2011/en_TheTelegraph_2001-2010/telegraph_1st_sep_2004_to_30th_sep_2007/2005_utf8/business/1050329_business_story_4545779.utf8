 Cisco hooked to new generation network

 M. RAJENDRAN

 Kovalam, March 28: Cisco Systems will focus on a next generation network ? the Cisco NGN ? which the networking major is bringing in for telecom, infotech and cable service providers.

 The new system will not only improve the delivery of Cisco?s existing services but also offer broadband services like voice, video and data on a single platform.

 The new products are aimed at helping operators offer solutions that provide greater network intelligence, integration and flexibility. Operators will be able to offer more services by using one or a combination of product switches available on a single platform. This, in turn, will generate higher revenue for them.

 Based on the Internet protocol, the company claims that the Cisco NGN will help telecom carriers move from simple basic telecom services like voice and short message services to high-end value added services like videos. 

 Ranganath Salgame, president, India and the Saarc region, Cisco Systems, said, ?Cisco has a comprehensive vision for the service-providers? market. We want to provide an intelligent, efficient and flexible solution that connect customers with services, services with networks and networks with each other.?

 Cisco has identified a few areas among the major service-based businesses, like gaming, network-based personal video recorders, video-on-demand and wireless fidelity (Wi-fi) home networks and mobility in the consumer segment. Small and medium-sized companies are likely to focus on the use of all sorts of managed services such as hosting and security.

 ?For Cisco, the IP NGN is a sweeping transformation of both a service provider?s entire network and its business. This transformation does not end at a single point ? service providers cannot simply buy an IP NGN. Like carrier?s businesses and service plans, the IP NGN also constantly evolves to adapt to customer demands and new technology opportunities,? Salgame said.

 ?While voice, as we know them today, will initially be a significant aspect of the service portfolio, it will give way over time to richer all-media services encompassing voice, video and data,? said Sudhir Narang, senior vice-president, service provider and government, India and Saarc region, Cisco Systems. 

 International Telecommunications Union has defined the fundamental features of IP NGN in a way that includes all kinds of services.

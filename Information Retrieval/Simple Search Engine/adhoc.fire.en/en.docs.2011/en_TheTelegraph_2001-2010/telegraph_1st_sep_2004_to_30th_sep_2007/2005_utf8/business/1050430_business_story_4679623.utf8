 Calcutta, April 29: CESC has registered a net profit of Rs 160 crore in 2004-05 compared with Rs 93 crore in 2003-04, an increase of 72 per cent.

 Net profit for the fourth quarter ending March 31, 2005 has surged 129 per cent to 39 crore from Rs 17 crore in the previous year.

 The net sales in 2004-05 has gone down marginally to Rs 2386 crore from Rs 2416 crore in the previous year.

 The interest cost of the company has also gone down to Rs 257 crore from Rs 348 crore following the debt restructuring exercise undertaken by the RPG controlled utility.

 Analysts said profits have gone up in spite of the average tariff going down marginally in 2004-05. There will be a further reduction in tariff in the current fiscal according to the tariff order passed by the West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission.

 CESC vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said, ?The increase, primarily, is a result of volume growth and substantial efficiency improvement initiatives that has been undertaken by the company.?

 The transmission and distribution (T amp;D) losses have come down to 16.2 per cent from 17.5 per cent in 2003-04.

 ?The reduction in T amp;D losses has also contributed to the revenues of the company,? said Goenka. 

 The fuel cost of the company has increased to Rs 760 crore from Rs 664 crore because of higher generation as well as sharp increase in coal prices and freight charges. 

 A lower power import bill has also added to the bottomline of the company. CESC is now importing 800 million units of power from WBSEB against 1,200 million units in the previous years.

 The plant load factor of Budge Budge, Southern and Titagarh generating stations has gone up to 85 per cent in 2004-05.

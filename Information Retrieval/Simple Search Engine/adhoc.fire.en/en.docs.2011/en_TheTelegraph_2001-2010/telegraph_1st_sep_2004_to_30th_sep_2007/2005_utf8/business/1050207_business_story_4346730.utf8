 Maruti pace-setter for layoff laws

 Rocky road ahead

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: Companies across the country have received a shot in the arm with the Supreme Court ruling that courts should not direct the reinstatement of retrenched workers on the grounds of ?sympathy?.

 A division bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S. B. Sinha has upheld the retrenchment of workers of Maruti Ltd ? the company that was founded by the late Sanjay Gandhi ? which went into liquidation in 1978.

 The workers had been seeking reinstatement in Maruti Udyog Ltd, which was formed in 1980 when the government took over the assets of the defunct company. 

 Punjab and Haryana High Court had ordered Maruti Udyog to reinstate 72 workers who were laid off in 1978 after the payment of one month?s salary.

 The Supreme Court said Maruti Udyog Ltd, which is now majority controlled by Suzuki Motor of Japan, need not take these workers back while setting aside the high court?s order.

 ?While construing a statute, ?sympathy? has no role to play. This court cannot interpret the provisions of the Maruti Limited (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1980, ignoring the binding decisions of the Constitution bench of this court only by way of sympathy to the workmen concerned,? said Justice Sinha who wrote the judgment for the bench. 

 Quoting earlier judgments of the apex court, judges said, ?In a case of this nature, this court should not even exercise its jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution of India on misplaced sympathy (A. Umarani Vs Cooperative Societies and Others).? Under this omnibus article, ?the Supreme Court, in the exercise of its jurisdiction, may pass such decree or make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter?. 

 However, ?Sympathy or sentiment by itself cannot be a ground for passing an order?, the judges observed in the instant case citing a decision taken in the Teri Oat Estates (P) Ltd Vs U. T. of Chandigarh (2004, 2 SCC 130). 

 The late Sanjay Gandhi-founded Maruti Ltd, a small car manufacturing company, that was defunct in 1978 when the Janata Party-led government was formed under Morarji Desai. In 1980, when the Congress came back to power under Indira Gandhi, the Union government acquired the company and rechristened it as Maruti Udyog Ltd under the Maruti Limited (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1980. 

 The workers sought re-employment in Maruti Udyog after Maruti Ltd was wound up and the company was taken over by the Centre. ?The erstwhile workmen of the company thereafter issued a notice of demand of re-employment upon the appellant (Maruti Udyog),? the Supreme Court pointed out, adding the Labour Court opined that the company was liable to reemploy the workmen with back wages. 

 The appellant filed a writ petition before Punjab and Haryana High Court against the Labour Court order. The high court said those workers in service at the time of the government?s takeover should be re-employed. Maruti came to the apex court against this verdict.

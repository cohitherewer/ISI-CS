 Nath gets more headroom

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Nath: Well armed

 New Delhi, July 25: The cabinet committee on WTO, chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, today conveyed commerce minister Kamal Nath that he can offer higher FDI limits in telecom, finance and insurance at the WTO negotiating table provided the advanced countries agree to grant more work visas to Indian professionals and adopt a more liberal policy for business process outsourcing (BPO). 

 The initial FDI offers in these sectors were already made during the WTO negotiations on services in 2003.

 The commerce ministry can now offer up to 74 per cent FDI in telecom, 49 per cent in banking and 26 per cent in insurance as part of Indias commitments at the WTO provided the developed countries offer a better deal for Indian professionals and ease business process outsourcing norms.

 Some new sectors will also figure on the countrys revised offer list. These include services in business, construction and related engineering, health, tourism and travel, maritime and transport. The cabinet committees decision will give the ministry flexibility to move forward in the WTO talks within the autonomous liberalisation limits.

 While business process outsourcing comes under Mode 1 in WTO parlance, the movement of professionals comes under Mode 4. Both these areas are of high priority for India. 

 In the WTO talks on services, a country can withdraw its offer if it is not satisfied with those of others. But, after the final agreement, a country cannot go back on its offer unless it compensates for it.

 Gail counts cost of delay in pipeline

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Pipe dream

 Calcutta, June 19: With the Centre yet to finalise its stand on the proposed Dahej-Uran pipeline, the project has been held up indefinitely leading to a significant loss for Gail (India) Ltd.

 The proposed 504-km pipeline, passing through Gujarat and Maharashtra, will transport gas from LNG terminals to Mumbai.

 Gail had initiated the project in late 2002 in the wake of Reliance?s gas discovery in the Krishna-Godavari basin and its subsequent plans to bring gas from the east coast to the Mumbai region through a cross-country pipeline.

 However, the tender issued by the company to procure the pipeline has been cancelled twice leaving the project in a state of limbo.

 The cost of the project has also escalated from Rs 1,416 crore to Rs 1,830 crore due to the inordinate delay.

 The pipeline would have served power-starved Maharashtra, especially Mumbai. Private power producers like Tata Power and Torrent Power were planning to use the LNG imported by Shell in Hazira and Petronet LNG Ltd in Dahej. The power majors had also booked capacities in the pipeline, which is designed to carry 12 MMSCMD gas.

 Meanwhile, the Parliamentary standing committee on petroleum and natural gas has asked the petroleum ministry to set up a high level team to look into the matter.

 The ministry has decided to set up a technical committee with representatives from Gail and the Centre for High Technology (CHT).

 However, Gail wrote to the ministry that a committee should be constituted independent of Gail and CHT.

 With the Centre dragging its feet, the entire process is getting delayed.

 The first tender was cancelled following a Presidential Directive in October 2004. It was floated in February 2004.

 Gail had floated a new tender in November 2004, including fresh set of technical specifications, in compliance with the Presidential Directives. 

 The tender included HSAW pipes, which were omitted in the first tender, following lobbying from manufacturers of these pipes, industry sources said.

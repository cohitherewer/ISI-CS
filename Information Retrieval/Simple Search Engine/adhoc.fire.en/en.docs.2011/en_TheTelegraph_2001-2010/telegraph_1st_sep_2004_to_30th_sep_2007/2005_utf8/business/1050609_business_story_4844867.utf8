 Radico Khaitan in high spirits

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 8: Radico Khaitan has embarked on a Rs 85-crore expansion plan, encouraged by a 39 per cent growth in its net profits at Rs 35.86 crore in 2004-05. The company had clocked a Rs 25.70-crore profit in 2003-04. 

 We would spend about Rs 85 crore over next two years in acquiring bottling units in southern parts of the country and to enhance the existing spirits production capacities, said Abhishek Khaitan, managing director of Radico Khaitan.

 He said the company would fund the expansion with a mix of internal accruals and debt. We are cash rich and have a very low debt-equity ratio. Hence, it would not be difficult to raise fresh debt from the market. He ruled out any dilution of the promoters equity in the company, currently at 57 per cent.

 The company has achieved a topline growth of 37 per cent in 2004-05 at Rs 995 crore from Rs 727 crore in the previous fiscal. We sold 10.02 million cases last fiscal, a growth of 58 per cent from previous years 6.3 million cases, he said.

 The company is eyeing 25 per cent sales growth during 2005-06. It has chalked out a strategy to expand the domestic as well as the international presence of its brands. 

 The company had recently bought Whytehall brands from its joint venture partner, Bacardi International Ltd.

 Radicos exports business grew 70 per cent last fiscal and is targeting a 100 per cent growth this year. The company plans to deepen its penetration in 28 countries it is already present. On the domestic front, it plans to aggressively expand brands like 8 PM Excellency whisky.

 We had launched 8 PM Excellency brandy and 8 PM Bermuda rum in Kerala and Andhra Pradesh last fiscal. Now, we plan to take the brands countrywide, Khaitan said.

 The company also plans to launch Magic Moments vodka during the next quarter.

 In the domestic liquor market, Radico Khaitan enjoys a share of 11 per cent. Its 8 PM whisky brand occupies a 65 per cent share in the upper regular segment and 15 per cent in the regular segment.

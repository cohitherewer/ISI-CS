 FDI cap in loan recast firms at 49%

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 9: The government today allowed foreign direct investment (FDI) up to 49 per cent in asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) that acquire non-performing assets from banks and financial institutions. 

 The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) will, henceforth, consider applications from persons and entities eligible to invest in India in the equity capital of ARCs registered with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under the FDI route, a finance ministry statement said.

 The government made it clear that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) cannot pick up stakes in these companies. The FDI policy would be reviewed after two years.

 ARCs acquire non-performing assets (NPAs) from banks or financial institutions (FIs), along with mortgaged securities. These companies were created after the enactment of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (Sarafesi), which empowers lenders to take possession of mortgaged security without judicial intervention.

 The decision to allow FDI in ARCs came on a day when US treasury secretary John Snow held discussions with finance minister P. Chidambaram and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia on various aspects of the Indian economy. Yesterday, after meeting RBI governor Y. V. Reddy, Snow had called for greater participation of overseas banks, saying it would help strengthen Indias financial sector.

 The Reserve bank has allowed three ARCs at present, though some banks are planning more. Bad loans of public sector banks are in the range of Rs 60,000 crore. 

 Where investments by an individual exceeds 10 per cent, asset reconstruction firms will have to comply with provisions of Sarafesi act. The Reserve Bank will soon come out with a notification for foreign direct investment in ARCs that is in tune with the provisions of Fema.

 Last year, Asset Reconstruction Company of India (Arcil) requested the government to allow foreign institutional investors to buy distressed assets. GE, Citicorp, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley were believed to be among the waiting hordes tugging at the door to cash in on the opportunities arising out of soured loans. Senior Arcil executives had met officials of Sebi, the RBI and the finance ministry on the issue.

 Volcker-hit cos get a boost

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 18: Company affairs minister P.C. Gupta today said Indian firms named in the Volcker report do not appear to have violated the norms of the company law.

 On the face of it, this (violation of company law) does not seem possible, Gupta said at the economic editors conference.

 Gupta said his ministry has not launched a formal probe into the matter. I have only asked my officers to look if the company law has been violated by any firm named in the report, he said.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram had earlier said the government might ask some of these firms to share information.

 The Volcker report has snowballed into a major controversy following the charges made against more than 100 Indian companies of paying illegal surcharges to receive contracts under the UNs oil-for-food programme in Iraq. Some of the companies named in the 623-page UN enquiry report are STC, Tata International, Kirloskar Engines, Ajanta Pharma, and Ranbaxy.

 Gupta said China and South Africa have dismissed the report even before taking it up. It has become an issue only in India, he added. 

 The minister said the government is finalising the amendments to the Competition Act, 2002. Amendments to the Competition Act are under examination of the government. These are expect to be finalised soon, he said.

 The much-awaited amendments to the Companies Act, 1956 is under examination. It is a complex and comprehensive process. It would not be feasible to specify any definite date by which the new bill will be introduced in Parliament, but the process will be complete at the earliest, he said.

 The government has also decided to initiate action against companies that have closed down after raising public money in the mid-nineties and also strengthening the Serious Fraud Investigation Office.

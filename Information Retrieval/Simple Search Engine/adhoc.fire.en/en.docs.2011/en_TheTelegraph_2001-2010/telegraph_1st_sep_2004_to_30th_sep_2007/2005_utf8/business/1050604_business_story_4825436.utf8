 Mumbai, June 3: The newly appointed managing director of Fiat India, Paolo Castagna, today outlined key focus areas for the companys revival. Besides sreamlining operations and re-working its brand strategy at the premium end, an improvement in its after-sales service and dealer network are also on the cards.

 Castagna was speaking at the launch of the 1.6-litre petrol Fiat Adventure Sport. It comes at a price tag of Rs 5.58 lakh ex-Mumbai.

 According to the company, the Fiat Adventure Sport is aimed at a new generation of consumers who look for the latest trends in style, safety, engine and performance.

 Castagna takes over Fiat Indias reins at a time when the subsidiary has not been successful in ramping up sales. While Fiat India has sold around 300 cars on an average in the past three months, its Kurla plant remains under-utilised. On the other hand, its Ranjangaon facility near Pune, which has a capacity to produce 75,000 cars, is now being used as a training institute.

 Castagna said, Our focus is clear and we are here to stay. We need to streamline our operations and target our brand strategy at the premium end, being in sync with changes in the economy where customers have high purchasing power and aspire to be different.

 While Fiat is analysing the best choice for the Indian consumer, Castagna said tests conducted for the Panda and the Idea have received positive results.

 The task, therefore, is to create a product with the required technical specifications, correct costing and perfect pricing structure, he added. 

 He said it would take at least a year for the cars to be launched in the country. The Panda is a premium hatchback and the Idea is a compact multi-purpose vehicle.

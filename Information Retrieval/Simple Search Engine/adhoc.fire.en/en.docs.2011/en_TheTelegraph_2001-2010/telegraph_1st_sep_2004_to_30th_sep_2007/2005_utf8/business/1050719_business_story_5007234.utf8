 Block deals turn focus on Reliance 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 18: Two huge block deals in Reliance Industries shares were the talk of the town today. 

 On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the counter saw a block deal for around 60 lakh shares at a market price of Rs 663. It was followed closely by another deal of 20 lakh shares, this time on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).

 The total value of the two deals could be in excess of Rs 530 crore, market circles said.

 It was definitely not a domestic institution as they do not have the resources to either buy or sell such a huge quantity of Reliance shares, a dealer,who has been closely tracking the scrip, said.

 The common surmise is that some hedge funds known to take huge risks in the market had bought into the scrip some months ago when uncertainty was ruling high in the minds of investors due to the family squabble. They were cashing out after making a killing and the shares were sold to a foreign institutional investor willing to take a long term view.

 Reliance lost Rs 5.35 to close at Rs 661.25 on the BSE today and the block deal pushed volumes to 79.85 lakh shares aggregating a turnover of Rs 529.73 crore, the highest recorded for any single company on the bourse. 

 The second in the turnover chart was Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Capital at Rs 166.16 crore with 41.06 lakh shares changing hands.

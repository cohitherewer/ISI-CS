 US textile industry braces for change 

 PAUL BLUSTEIN

 Weaving it in 

 Jamestown, N.C, Jan. 1: For Jeff Johnson and the 686,800 other workers in the US textile and apparel industry, cries of quot;Happy New Year quot; may well ring hollow: As of midnight Friday, rules that have protected US mills from foreign competition will expire, exposing an already troubled industry to the full force of globalisation.

 Wherever it leads ?whether to retooling plants to churn out high-tech fabrics or to widespread layoffs after surging imports - Johnson and others at the Oakdale Cotton Mills think their world is about to change.

 quot;Were apprehensive, quot; said Johnson, 44, who has spent 28 years at the same yarn and twine-making firm where his father and grandfather worked, in a town where workers still inhabit the homes built by the company decades ago. quot;Not knowing is the big thing. quot;

 North Carolinas Piedmont Triad, an area in the central part of the state that encompasses Greensboro, High Point and Winston-Salem, is no stranger to the dynamics of world trade. The area has been hurt by a 10-year slide that has cut the number of U.S. textile jobs by more than half as production shifted overseas. In the process, such local anchors Cone Mills Corp. and Burlington Industries Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection.

 Those still in business know the new year will catapult them into an even more integrated world, and they are girding for battle in a variety of ways - pouring money into new technologies and products, slashing costs, casting off unprofitable lines, and lobbying Washington for temporary protections.

 Allen Gant, president and chief executive of Glen Raven Inc., predicted quot;tremendous change quot; with quot;a lot of displaced jobs, quot; and he is repositioning his North Carolina company to concentrate on high-value textiles, such as the nylon used in bulletproof vests.

 Meanwhile, he is shedding businesses he thinks are most vulnerable to foreign competition. quot;We dont do T-shirts. We dont do commodity apparel, quot; Gant said. Weve tried very hard to exit those areas where we think (severe competition from China) will take place, and I feel very sorry for anyone whos in the way of that juggernaut. quot;

 The expiring quotas are causing concern around the globe. For the past three decades, the United States, Europe and Canada have maintained quotas limiting the amount of textiles and clothing that individual countries can export to them. Established to shelter the domestic textile industry in developed countries, the quotas were doled out in a way that let textile and garment plants in smaller countries such as Sri Lanka and Honduras prosper through guaranteed sales to the worlds richest markets. Scrapping those quotas means that retailers and brand-name purveyors such as Wal-Mart, the Gap and Liz Claiborne can buy as many pants, tops, sheets, towels and other such products as they like from whatever country they like.

 Although free trade wont prevail entirely - the United States continues to impose tariffs averaging about 16 percent on imported clothing from most countries - relaxing the rules is expected to benefit consumers by lowering prices. 

 Another big winner will likely be China, whose low-cost, super-efficient manufacturers are widely predicted to grab a huge portion of the worldwide textile and apparel trade, more than half by some estimates.

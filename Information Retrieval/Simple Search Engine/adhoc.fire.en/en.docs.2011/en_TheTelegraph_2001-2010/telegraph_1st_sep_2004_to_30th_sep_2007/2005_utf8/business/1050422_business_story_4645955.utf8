 Cook up a storm, but with care

 When it comes to aesthetics, 

 lighting and chimmey can be put to good use

 An area which is arguably the most understated usually and left to the mercy of the builder?s design notions is the kitchen. One can live out of suitcases, sleep on a mattress but the kitchen cannot be substituted that easily, no matter how convenient home delivery is today.

 The design situation under Indian cooking conditions is all the more complex ? the fact that domestic helps, too, will be using it has to be considered. Your fancy chinaware might end up in dust if proper sink space is not provided. Water will be used freely ? so the materials will rot in time if this factor is neglected.

 Key to planning

 Usually, the shape of the kitchen is not in the control of the buyer. But it would be an idea worth trying by providing the kitchen space requirement to the builder in advance so that individual preferences can be accommodated.

 You could try and fit in a kitchen-cum-dining area in a U-shaped form or have an extended L-shaped pantry.

 If you are stuck in a confined rectangular form, as most of us end up being, it is really convenient to keep the sink, gas and refrigerator within a 20-feet perimeter. Since the sink involves plumbing and the gas needs to be only in the kitchen, the refrigerator ends up being in the living area. A bit of planning could avoid this.

 Water, water everywhere

 Counter tops are usually in-built with stone ? granite being a common option but black Kadapa (formerly Cuddapah) stone is also used to save cost. Walls are usually tiled. Stainless steel counters are also in vogue.

 It is worth investing in basics like these as the enamel-painted wall will ?bloom? no matter how hard one tries to avoid it. It is easier to clean and maintain as well. 

 The flooring, too, needs to be easy to clean, non-absorbent, strong and pleasant-looking ? perhaps different from the flooring in the other areas. Tiles are a good option but the workmanship in the joints needs to be monitored carefully and the tile selected should be non- slippery.

 The oil factor

 All the beautiful things you do will not remain beautiful for long if the cooking oil factor is not considered.

 The exhaust fan is thus a good investment in the mere least but it should be placed such that the air is sucked out and not dispersed within. The grime in the areas around will become an eyesore if not cleaned regularly. Kitchen chimneys are a good aesthetic option but are more expensive. 

 The waterfall

 The sink could be in-built with stone or it could be of stainless steel. This area usually tends to have a water purifier and a plate rack as well. It is important to ensure that water falls on the drain board and not all over the place.

 Some people suggest two sinks as well. The Indian peculiarity is that planning has to be done for washing utensils on the ground, especially the bulkier ones as it is usually the domestics who end up doing it. So, provide for the dishwashers in such a way that the kitchen is not converted into a swimming pool after they are through.

 Pots and pans

 Where and how does one put all the utensils and daily cooking ingredients? Where does one store the bulky stuff ? again a typical Indian situation? The idea, no matter how archaic it sounds, is to list it all down.

 The area below the counter tops could be designated for the gas cylinder. Have a set of drawers and keep in mind that it is worth it to have partitions in some of these drawers to place the knives, spoons and forks properly. The bulkier items could have some space allocated here.

 If designed well, one can avoid using the space above arm?s reach ? everything in the kitchen should be placed within arm?s reach and one should not expect the super mom to be super woman as well.

 But the area above the door height is used a lot for dead storage, for infrequently used items or can double as a store.

 Wood wise

 The furniture ideally should have no wood or ply but for shutters one cannot usually avoid it. Even if one has to use wood, either it can be cased in aluminium or coated with preservatives and painted. Avoid anything resting on the ground susceptible to water retention.

 It is also a good idea not to use ply boards as shelves or drawer bottoms ? use stone or mesh instead. Do not leave wood or boards exposed ? laminate it or paint it. Leaving air gaps from the floor is also a good idea as it allows breathing space and makes life all the more difficult for cockroaches to build their habitats.

 The new age

 A lot of improvement has happened in kitchen design and if you can afford it, you should consider these. A lot of add-ons are available, which you can selectively blend into the design. Another option is to customise these add-ons yourself ? more time consuming but cheaper.

 Due to paucity of space, one usually needs to add another counter space in the form of a low-height narrow-depth cupboard, which apart from accommodating many items, can be used for the microwave and other electronic gadgets.

 One could make a really functional kitchen beginning with Rs 25,000 and going up to Rs 3 lakh.

 Having an idea at the very onset, getting the builder to do things the way you want instead of breaking and making later on, helps in proper funds utilisation. 

 Lights, colour, action

 It is not only functionality that is important in this vital part of your home. Colour and light and small design touches make it the hearth. 

 The tiles need not be put in a single colour and one could sprinkle tiles of a brighter colour sparsely. 

 The lights could be put only on the counters instead of general flat lighting. Small wrought iron accessories could add an additional spark. Stained glass panels and a small space for cook books could be worked in, too.

 In the end, it is a reflection of your identity even in your kitchen.

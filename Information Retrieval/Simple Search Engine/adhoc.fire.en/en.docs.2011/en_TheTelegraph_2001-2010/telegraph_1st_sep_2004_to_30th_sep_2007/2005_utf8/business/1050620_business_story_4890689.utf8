 Hindustan Shipyard in dock over $4.7m deal

 S. P. S. PANNU

 Risky venture

 New Delhi, June 19: Hindustan Shipyard Limited (HSL) is in trouble for unnecessarily placing a $4.7-million order for a floating dock with a Chinese company and siphoning off Rs 10 crore from the shipping ministry. HSL did not eventually buy the floating dock and diverted the funds for other purposes.

 The latest audit report of the shipping ministry reveals that the chief vigilance officer of HSL had pointed out that the floating dock was not required as the Vizag-based shipyard was operating way below its full capacity. However, its advice was ignored by the shipping ministry mandarins. The HSL management wanted to buy the floating dock to increase the shipyard capacity. 

 The report also indicts the shipping ministry for clearing the proposal despite being aware that the existing facilities at HSL were not being fully utilised because of a continuous shortage of orders.

 The ministry cleared the proposal to acquire the floating dock at a cost of Rs 22.5 crore in January 2000 and released Rs 10 crore to HSL in March 2000 to pay Qingdao Beihai Shipyard of China.

 The report states that the release of funds to HSL was unwise and irregular as the work for the floating dock had not actually been awarded to the Chinese shipyard. 

 The ministry issued orders for scrapping the tender in August 2000 as HSL had committed irregularities in calling the tenders, making comparative statements and negotiating with the second lowest bidder, which was also a Chinese company. This firm had complained to the shipping ministry that HSL had committed grave financial irregularities in evaluating the tender.

 The report reveals that in a review meeting held in July 2003, the financial adviser of the shipping ministry found that no action had been taken on the project for which HSL had taken Rs 10 crore. He wanted the ministry to look into the matter.

 The ministry asked HSL to confirm whether the money was kept in an escrow account and present details of the interest that had accrued on the amount. However, the ministry was informed that the money had been diverted to some other purposes.

 The report states that HSL was able to divert the funds because of inadequate monitoring by the ministry. It highlights the fact that even after knowing that the funds released earlier had been diverted by HSL, the ministry did not ask the shipyard to refund the amount along with the interest due on the amount.

 HSL also wasted Rs 4.3 lakh on advertising for global tenders from time to time apart from paying consultancy charges for a feasibility study on acquiring the floating dock.

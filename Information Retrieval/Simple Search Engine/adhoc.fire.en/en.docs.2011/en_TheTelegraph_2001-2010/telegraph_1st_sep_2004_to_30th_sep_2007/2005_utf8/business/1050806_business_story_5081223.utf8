 Lodha faces poser on structure of firms

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 5: The Institute of Chartered Accountants (ICAI) will seek an explanation from R.S. Lodha on the structure of his audit firms following complaints of a breach of ethics and violation of the companies, income tax and banking regulation acts.

 We have received written complaints from three individuals against the Lodha firms last month, ICAI president Kamlesh Vikamsey said.

 Chartered accountants Om Prakash Agarwal, Shashi Agarwal and Suresh Kumar Sharma have complained that the Lodha firms have furnished names of 14 persons as partners with false, fraudulent and malafide motives to conduct audits of companies beyond the limits permitted under the companies and income tax acts.

 The complainants have asked the ICAI council to hold an inquiry against the Lodhas and take appropriate action, including removing their names from the register of ICAI members.

 We will seek an explanation from the Lodhas and give them about 30 days to respond to the charges, said Vikamsey. However, since this involves careful examination, we cannot divulge more details, he added.

 Nevertheless, he said the institute would collect the necessary statements and evidences from both the parties. It could take anything from two months to two years to hear both the parties in detail and formalise a stand on the matter, he added.

 According to the complainants, Lodha and Company has three partners ? R. S. Lodha and his two sons H. V. Lodha and A. V. Lodha ? and they were allowed to carry out audit of a maximum of 60 companies. However, the company furnished data to the ICAI that it had 14 partners to undertake tax audit of 280 companies.

 The Lodha camp has termed the complaint as baseless. We have not yet received any communication from the institute. We have been absolutely transparent in our disclosures and we can furnish all the necessary details to the institute as and when required, a Lodha camp insider said. Everyone is aware of the circumstances and can make their own judgement, he added.

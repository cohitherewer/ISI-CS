 AMP may pull out of Sanmar venture

 Sydney, June 6 (Bloomberg): AMP Ltd, Australias largest life insurer, said it could sell its 26 per cent stake in the Indian life insurance venture with the Sanmar group.

 AMP formed the Chennai-based venture, AMP Sanmar Life Insurance Company, in January 2002 and it now employes 800 staff and 8,000 sales agents. 

 When asked about how the company is planning to divest its stake, AMP chief executive Andrew Mohl said: An outright sale or by bringing in a new partner.

 The venture, the tenth-biggest life insurance business in India, is still several years from being profitable, he pointed out. 

 AMPs stake in the Indian venture was valued at less than $7.6 million on December 31, Mohl added.

 Earlier, the Chennai-based Sanmar group had approved the sale of a 23 per cent stake in its life insurance joint venture, AMP-Sanmar Life Insurance, to Australian partner, AMP. 

 The partners have approved the sale of a 23 per cent stake to AMP, AMP-Sanmar chief operating officer B. Natraj had said.

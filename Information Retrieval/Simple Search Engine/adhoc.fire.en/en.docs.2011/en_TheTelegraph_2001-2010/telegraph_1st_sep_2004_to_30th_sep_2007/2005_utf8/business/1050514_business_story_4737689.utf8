 FM showers praise

 New Delhi, May 13 (PTI): Observing that RRBs had done very well last year in providing rural credit, finance minister P. Chidambaram today proposed that sponsor banks in the states should horizontally link their operations with RRBs.

 We have proposed that the sponsor banks horizontally link their operations with the RRBs. Besides in states which have more than one RRB, these rural banks can be allowed to consolidate, Chidambaram said in the Lok Sabha today, intervening in a debate on a bill to amend the RRB Act, 1976.

 He said the sponsor banks were primarily the public sector banks and some private ones.

 CPI(M) member Basudeb Acharia had moved the amendment bill which sought that RRBs should be brought under a single umbrella of a national rural bank or the Nabard for proper coordination of their activities.

 Acharia said the purpose of the amendment was to streamline the functioning of RRBs and amalgamate them for small states like those in the Northeast.

 Maintaining that RRBs had substantially improved their performance in 2004-05, Chidambaram said these banks had granted rural credit worth Rs 15,579 crore in 2004-05 compared with Rs 6,200 crore in 2000.

 Agricultural loans given by RRBs amounted to Rs 11,718 crore and over 14 lakh kisan credit cards were issued so far this year, Chidamabram said.

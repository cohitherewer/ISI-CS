 Foodgrain on VAT-free list

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Jan. 30: State governments can exempt foodgrain from value-added tax (VAT), which will be implemented from April 1. 

 Bengal finance minister and chairman of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers on VAT, Asim Dasgupta, said it was a ?very important decision? as it would bring relief to farmers in the drought-prone states. 

 Though some states wanted only rice to be kept out of the VAT net, the committee decided to exempt all foodgrain, including pulses, wheat, grams and jowar (millets), Dasgupta said at an interactive session attended by Union finance minister P. Chidambaram.

 Tamil Nadu Farmers? Association president Sivasamy asked for exemption of inputs in agriculture, such as seeds and fertilisers, as farmers were scorched by the last four years of drought.

 Allaying fears of trade bodies, Dasgupta said VAT would actually help traders in their fight against bureaucratic harassment. Both trade and the government benefited in Haryana, where the new tax regime has been implemented, he added.

 Small dealers with an annual turnover of up to Rs 5 lakh will be exempted from VAT. This compares with the existing threshold of Rs 3 lakh under sales tax norms in Tamil Nadu. Other resellers with annual turnover above Rs 5 lakh and up to Rs 50 lakh would come under a ?simple compounding scheme?. As part of this, a certain percentage of their annual turnover will be taken by states. On the basis of these rules, nearly 50 per cent of Tamil Nadu?s 4 lakh registered dealers will be out of VAT, he said.

 Of the 550 commonly traded commodities, 46 will be exempted from VAT. Each state can pick 10 items of local importance for exemption. 

 ?The VAT regime will help overcome the problem of double taxation under the present sales tax structure of states. It will eliminate all other levies like, additional sales tax, creating a win-win situation for all,? Dasgupta said.

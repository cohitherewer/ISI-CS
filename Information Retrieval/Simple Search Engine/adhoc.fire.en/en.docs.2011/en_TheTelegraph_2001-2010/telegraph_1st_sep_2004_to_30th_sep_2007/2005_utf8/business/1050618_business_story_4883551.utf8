 Fresh stake churn at ING Life

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 17: Life insurance ventures in the country are in for a major rejig, especially in their holding patterns. 

 After ING Vysya Bank, now GMR Industries may sell its holding in ING Vysya Life Insurance Company. GMR owns close to 50 per cent in the insurance venture. 

 The GMR board decided to consider the sale, which could provide the cash required for expansion or part repayment of loans, at a meeting held on Thursday.

 ING Vysya Bank has recently sold 14.87 per cent in the company to Gujarat Ambuja Cements (GACL) for Rs 60.9 crore. GACL will now have a representative on the nine-member board of directors of ING Vysya Life. However, the companys insurance products will continue to be distributed exclusively through the bank.

 The ING group now holds 26 per cent in ING Vysya Life. The other major shareholder apart from the GMR group is Enam, the well-known investment banking outfit. ING Vysya Lifes premium income has grown 312 per cent in 2004 and is now ranked eighth among private sector players.

 Interestingly, AMP Sanmar Life Insurance Company is also set to witness a change in its shareholding pattern as Australias AMP Life and the Chennai-based Sanmar group have decided to exit the life insurance business. AMP is looking at an outright sale of 26 per cent to an existing or new player. 

 Recently, Aviva plc, a British life insurer, indicated that it was willing to buy AMP?s stake in the venture. Grant Barrans, director of Aviva Life International, said it would consider any opportunity and was open to acquisitions as well. 

 The government may raise the FDI ceiling in the insurance sector to 49 per cent. IRDA is looking at the parentage of Indian promoters of life insurance companies to examine whether there is any indirect foreign control.

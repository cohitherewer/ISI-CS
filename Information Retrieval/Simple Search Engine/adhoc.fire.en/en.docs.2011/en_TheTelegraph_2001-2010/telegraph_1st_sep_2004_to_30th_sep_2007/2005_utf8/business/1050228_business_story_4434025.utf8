The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Larger canvas for animation industry

 In fantasy land

 Calcutta, Feb. 27: Nasscom has urged the Indian animation firms to take a cue from the success of the IT industry and create a complete system that will nurture the nascent $300-million industry.

 A study by Anderson Consulting estimates that around $2-billion worth of animation work could flow into India in the next three years.

 The apex body for the software industry has urged domestic animation companies to take a series of initiatives to build a body of manpower talent to fuel the growth in this business.

 Nasscom is of the opinion that there is a need for an animation academy to build a steady pipeline of skilled professionals. The organisation could also serve as a platform for interaction between the industry and the academia and help develop a curriculum that will keep global interests in mind.

 According to industry estimates, there is an immediate demand for around 10,000 animators in the country. It is estimated that there will be a demand for 3,00,000 professionals in the next four years.

 ?There is a need to turn out good animators in the age group of 18-24,? said Kiran Karnik, president of Nasscom. ?The long-term need is for school-level training.?

 Nasscom also feels that the industry has to increase the level of interest among audiences and create a national brand for the global market.

 ?The marketing has to be at two levels ? the industry and the studio,? Karnik said. ?We could play a role in marketing the industry overseas. There is, however, a need for individual marketing of products and a brand creation. It is also necessary for domestic players to have a representation in major international animation markets and festivals to make their presence felt.?

 Nasscom also feels that the industry needs to promote the setting up of animation parks on the lines of the software technology parks.

 Another major step is to strengthen the interface between local studios and producers and also increase the range of applications to areas hitherto untouched, like documentaries.

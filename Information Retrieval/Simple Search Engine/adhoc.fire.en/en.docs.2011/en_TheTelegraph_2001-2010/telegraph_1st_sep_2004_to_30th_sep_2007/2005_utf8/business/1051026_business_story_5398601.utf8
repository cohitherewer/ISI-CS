 Calcutta, Oct. 25: IBM India has trained its sights on the government and small and medium business (SMB) segment to achieve a leadership position in the server market. The company has identified telecom, manufacturing and financial services as the key growth areas in India.

 The SMB segment, which consists of low-end and entry-level servers, constitute 63 per cent of the $551.8-million domestic server market.

 Shailesh Agarwal, country manager of TotalStorage Solutions, IBM India, said, We have launched new products and channel programmes that are specific to the SMB segment. The City-Server Bazaar programme, which is being rolled out in 20 cities, is aimed at generating awareness regarding servers. The channel network will also be doubled from 1000 partners in 27 cities in the next quarter.

 The company plans to address the specific needs of companies in different regions and has already launched programmes that will enable channel partners to position IBM solutions competitively.

 According to IDC reports, the company has achieved a 33.5 per cent growth year-on-year in the server segment, which is almost twice the market growth rate.

 We have already achieved the top position in the overall server market in terms of revenue in the second quarter of 2005, said Agarwal. Revenues in the non-x86 Unix server segment increased by 22.7 points compared with the second quarter last year, registering a growth of 150 per cent.

 In the enterprise server segment, IBM grew by 150 per cent against the market growth of 11 per cent, while in the entry-level segment, it grew by 89 per cent against a market growth of mere 1 per cent. Overall, the company grew by 62.8 per cent year-on-year compared with 23.8 per cent growth in the market.

 The idea is to make servers affordable and increase adoption of new technology. We are offering easy finance options to expand into smaller cities, added Agarwal.

 In the high-end server market, IBM plans to tap the growing infrastructure needs of the government and enterprises with new technology and cost-effective server delivery.

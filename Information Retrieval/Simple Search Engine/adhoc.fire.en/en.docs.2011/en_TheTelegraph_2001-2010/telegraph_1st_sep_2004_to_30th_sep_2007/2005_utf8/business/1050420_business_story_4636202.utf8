The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Call for back-office supercop

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Karnik: Damage control

 New Delhi, April 19: Business process outsourcing (BPO) companies and Nasscom have demanded a separate regulator to monitor cyber crimes in computer back offices.

 Last month, the BPO industry was rocked by a cyber fraud when rogue employees at a Pune-based BPO outfit for Citibank siphoned money out of the accounts of the bank?s customers in the US.

 The fraud has sent a scare through the US, which has already been wary about security breach in Indian call centres. But the BPO industry and Nasscom officials, who are just back from the US, say American customers are concerned but have still not pressed the panic buttons.

 However, the software services industry feels that there is a need to re-brand India as a secure country for business outsourcing and also create a separate regulatory institution.

 They contend that the recent cyber frauds will have no impact on the BPO business in India, but it will have to put its business in order. The National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom), the apex body for the software sector, has already embarked on a slew of measures.

 Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said, ?There were concerns raised by US companies. But they were also understanding and the stray incident has not created panic among them.?

 ?No order has been cancelled. But, the incident has caused a knee-jerk reaction. There was no reason for it. A foolproof mechanism to manage or guarantee a complete secure system does not exist anywhere in the world,? said Karnik.

 Speaking on the sidelines of the legal seminar on cyber security organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Karnik highlighted that the apex body had urged the government to create a separate regulatory mechanism for the BPO industry. In addition, it will hold a series of meetings with senior police officers across the country to train the police force.

 Nasscom will also undertake a special drive to showcase India as the most secure destination for outsourcing. It will be undertaken as part of a series of initiatives of branding India as an attractive BPO destination.

 Karnik has recently lead a team of IT and BPO industry members to the US and Europe on a 10-day visit to highlight the advantages of India as a leading destination in the global service supply chain.

 Nasscom highlighted that a slew of initiatives are underway in India like an amendment to the IT Act, training for enforcement authorities and the judiciary establishments of a self-regulatory organisation and certification and training programmes.

 The apex body of software and services said US experts briefed the delegation on the potential regulatory impact of similar money laundering cyber crimes in the US. They also stressed the need for cross-border co-operation in tackling cyber crimes. 

 Nasscom said, ?They also lauded India?s efforts in tackling cyber crimes and the role played by the IT and BPO industries in establishing world-class practices to tackle cyber crime.?

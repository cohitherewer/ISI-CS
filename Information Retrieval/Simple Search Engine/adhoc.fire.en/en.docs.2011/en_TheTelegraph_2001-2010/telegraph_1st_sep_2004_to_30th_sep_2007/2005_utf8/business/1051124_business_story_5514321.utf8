 Fresh jolt to Ranbaxy

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 23: The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Reserve Circuit (CAFC) has upheld the ruling of a preliminary injunction on Ranbaxy for marketing its blood-pressure reducing drug Quinapril in the US.

 Ranbaxy had moved the CAFC against an injunction order by a lower court pertaining to a suit filed by Pfizer. The American drug manufacturer filed a suit against Ranbaxy alleging that the Indian companys generic version had infringed upon its patented anti-hypertensive drug Accupril. 

 Ranbaxys Quinapril is a generic version of Pfizers Accupril, which is estimated to have a global market worth of $550 million, and is marketed in the US by Israeli pharmaceutical company Teva. 

 The merits of the principal case will now be argued at the District Court in New Jersey where a trial will be held on the merits of Ranbaxys non-infringement challenge.

 Ranbaxy said it intended to vigorously challenge infringement, validity and enforceability of the patent in further proceedings.

 The Appeals Court explained that its decision was based on preliminary records and noted that the claim construction, which is a legal issue, could change on the basis of a more developed factual record. Moreover, the preliminary injunction did not address the invalidity or enforceability of the patent, said Jay Deshmukh, vice-president (global intellectual property), Ranbaxy Ltd. 

 The lower court decision, which was handed down in March this year, had halted the sale of Quinapril in the US. The generic drug was launched in the US in December last year. 

 However, Ranbaxys other non-infringing formulations remain in the US market.

 The decision sends a clear message that the law does not encourage or excuse the infringement of valid pharmaceutical patents by generic companies, said Pfizer vice-chairman and general counsel Jeff Kinder.

 The ruling also reinforces the importance of intellectual property protection to the development of new, life-saving medicines, Kinder said.

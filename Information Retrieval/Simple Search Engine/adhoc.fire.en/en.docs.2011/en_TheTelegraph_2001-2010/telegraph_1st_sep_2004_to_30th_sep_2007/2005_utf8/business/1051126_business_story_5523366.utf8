 Gazprom ready for Iran pipeline

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 25: Gazprom is ready to build the proposed $4-billion Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline, Russian energy minister V.B. Khristemko said here today. 

 The minister said the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline is a commercially viable project and Gazprom is willing to participate in it. But it is important to remove the political risks, he stressed. Russia has a positive outlook about the project as it would be a pipeline of peace and help reduce the political tension, he added. 

 The minister said, While Gazprom is interested in the project and prepared to share the risk, we do hope other stakeholders will be accommodating enough to share the benefits with Gazprom. The Russian backing could prove to some extent to be a counterpoise to the US opposition to the project. Pakistan and India face an uphill task on the project as the US has blacklisted Iran as a rogue nuclear state.

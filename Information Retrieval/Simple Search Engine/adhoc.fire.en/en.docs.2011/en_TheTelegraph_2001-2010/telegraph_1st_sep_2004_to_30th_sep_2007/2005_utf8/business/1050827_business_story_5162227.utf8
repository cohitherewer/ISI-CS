 Corp Bank to settle accounts of MCX

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 26: Mangalore-based Corporation Bank today launched the clearing bank facility for the Multi-Commodity Exchange of India Ltd (MCX). This is yet another initiative by the bank to increase its revenues from fee-based services.

 Corporation Bank has a 4.9 per cent stake in MCX. All trade transactions done by broker members with the exchange will be settled through the bank.

 For this purpose, the bank will open clearing accounts with the electronic debit facility.

 Corporation Bank chairman and managing director V.K. Chopra said the bank would also provide need-based overdraft and bank guarantees to brokers using the clearing bank facility.

 Corporation Bank, which recorded a total turnover of Rs 46,000 crore, has more than 479 branches covered under its core-banking facility.

 The bank conducts 80 per cent of its business through the core-banking solution and proposes to increase it to 95 per cent by the end of this year.

 Corporation Banks move to launch the clearing bank facility for MCX comes at a time when investors are showing enhanced interests in commodities trading.

 According to Venkat R. Chary, MCX chairman, while the current daily turnover at the exchange is over Rs 2,500 crore, it is likely to surpass Rs 15,000 crore in the next three years. Analysts said such a figure could be achieved, as foreign institutional investors are likely to be allowed to participate in these markets.

 In early 2003, the government had lifted a four-decade old ban on futures trading in commodities.

 MCX, the worlds third largest bullion exchange, went live in November 2003 by introducing gold, silver and castor seed futures.

 Since then, it has expanded to other commodities, including energy, plastics, ferrous and non-ferrous metals and fibres among others. The exchange recently commenced futures trading in crude oil.

 Mitsubishi lines up more models for India

 New Delhi, Aug. 7 (PTI): Japans Mitsubishi Motors will launch a slew of models in India over the next few months in partnership with Hindustan Motors.

 We have lined up a series of launches for the Indian market, though these would be through the completely-built unit (CBU) route to begin with, Hindustan Motors president R. Santhanam said.

 The models, which the ailing Japanese carmaker plans to bring in India, include Lancer Cedia, mini-van Grandis and SUVs Montero and Outlander.

 Apart from these new ones, we will enhance focus on the Pajero in India, Santhanam said, adding that through these new products, the two automakers would widen their customer base.

 However, he conceded that these would be limited volume, high-price products.

 The companies, he said, would look at the market response to these models before taking a call on options like assembling them in India.

 In May, Mitsubishi, Japans only unprofitable automaker, announced plans to broaden its alliance with Hindustan Motors to boost sales and reduce costs. It may source parts from India in a bid to cut costs.

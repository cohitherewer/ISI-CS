 Rethink on priority lending

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Full circle

 Mumbai, Sept. 30: Housing loans will be prised out of banks priority sector lending if a Reserve Bank panels suggestion to revamp the way credit is classified is accepted.

 So sweeping are its proposals that even loans to the software industry, food and agro-processing units will be off the list of areas that must get a fixed ratio of bank finance.

 If the group has its way, only funds provided to agriculture, small-scale industries, small businesses and educational loans will fit the priority lending bill in future.

 Forty per cent of a banks loans must be disbursed to the priority sector; it is 32 per cent for foreign banks. Up to Rs 15 lakh lent for construction in rural/semi-urban, urban and metropolitan areas ? except those given to employees ? can be slotted into this all-important niche.

 The proposals have been prompted by the realisation that 30 years of priority sector lending have not ensured that key sectors in the economy get enough credit. The group does not feel the concept of priority loans has outlived its utility; only, it should be reviewed.

 Only those segments should be included which affect large sections of society, are of considerable importance to the national economy, benefit small borrowers and involve more modest loans, the panel said in its report to the RBI.

 Housing loans have grown at an explosive pace in recent years. That could change, since banks will have to lend elsewhere to meet priority loan norms. Private and foreign banks, high on home credit, might have to struggle.

 We will have to make extra efforts to achieve the priority sector lending target if housing loans are excluded, said the chief of a leading nationalised bank. He is likely to make his voice heard against the proposal.

 The group said in agriculture, the focus should be on direct lending. It recommended that finance for hire-purchase schemes covering agricultural machinery and implements, loans to National Co-operative Development Corporation (NCDC) for on-lending to co-operatives should not be considered for priority sector status.

 Infosys milestone

 Murthy: Goal achieved

 Mumbai, Oct. 25: Infosys Technologies is the first Indian company that is now compliant with Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley (SOX) Act of 2002. 

 Section 404 of the act requires each annual report of a company to contain a statement of the managements responsibility to establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure and procedure for financial reporting.

 The section also requires the companys auditor to attest to, and report on the managements assessment.

 In its latest quarterly report filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the Infosys management has assessed the companys internal control over financial reporting as on September 30. KPMG had independently verified the managements assessment and issued an unqualified opinion.

 I am delighted that we have achieved yet another milestone, chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy said.

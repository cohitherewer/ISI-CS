 Q amp;A

 For my granny

 My 85-year-old grandmother owns a house, for which she wants a home renovation loan. Since she is not in a position to repay the loan, I will pay the EMIs. Under such circumstances, can we get a home renovation loan?

 Srijita Sen, Calcutta

 Banks will not give home renovation loan to your grandmother 

 since she is well past the eligible age. You cannot 

 apply for such a loan since the property is not in your 

 name. In these circumstances, some banks or financial 

 institutions will allow you to apply for a home improvement 

 loan on a co-applicant basis. While your grandmother 

 will be the first applicant, you will be the co-applicant 

 and the loan will be disbursed based on your income.

 Home truths

 I have recently sold a residential property in Vadodara and made long-term capital gains. How can I save tax on the amount?

 Abhijit Shanghavi, by e-mail

 You can invest the amount in purchasing another property within two years from the date of sale or construct a house within three years. Alternatively, you can invest the amount in capital gains bonds, such as those issued by Nabard, NHAI, REC or Sidbi.

 Tax on the Net 

 What is the procedure of filing income tax returns through Internet? What is the minimum infrastructure facility that an assesse should have to do so?

 Sanjib Chaki, by e-mail

 Filing income tax returns through the Internet is 

 allowed in specified cities for salaried individuals 

 who do not have any income under the head profits 

 and gains from business or profession. The eligible 

 person has to register oneself on the website as designated 

 by the e-return administrator for this purpose. On registration, 

 one will be allotted a user identification number and 

 a password, using which, one can log on to the website 

 and prepare the return of income in the specified electronic 

 format, using the authorised return preparation software 

 provided there. For this purpose, one should have secure 

 access to a personal computer and the Internet.

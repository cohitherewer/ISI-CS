The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 A cover for your shelter

 Home signifies a set of emotions for any individual, be it pride, ownership, stability or a sense of belonging. It echoes the owner?s sentiment ? ?It?s my house?. 

 The household goods and personal belongings represent many years of financial and emotional investments for the entire family. 

 But what happens when a calamity strikes? All these may be lost due to theft, fire or natural calamities like earthquake, flood or the recent tsunami that shook the entire southern coastal areas of the Southeast Asian countries and shocked the entire world. 

 Keeping this in mind, Tata AIG General Insurance Company has come up with ?Home Secure?, a home insurance policy, with six pre-packaged coverage that a customer just tick against instead of listing down the entire household contents. 

 The perils that are covered include fire, earthquake, floods, explosions, riots, aircraft strike, burglary, theft, loss of cash in transit, plate glass, breakdown of appliances, personal accident and a host of man-made and natural disasters. In short, a simple way to protect every dimension of one?s home against any conceivable peril. 

 Senior Tata AIG official Sandeep Chandra said, ?There is a feeling among the general public that home insurance is expensive. On the contrary home insurance is as affordable as any other insurance product available in the market. You can protect your priceless investment for a very small amount. ?

 Assuming you have possessions worth Rs 300,000 in your house, you can insure these possessions for as little as Rs 3 a day to provide cover against fire, natural hazards (flood, earthquake and others), burglary and theft. 

 ?How much does Rs 3 buy you these days?? Chandra asked.

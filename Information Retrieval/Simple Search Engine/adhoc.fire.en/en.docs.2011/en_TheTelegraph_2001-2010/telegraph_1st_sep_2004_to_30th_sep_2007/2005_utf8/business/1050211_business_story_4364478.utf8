 ONGC to jack up output 5%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 10: ONGC will spend another Rs 6,593 crore in the next two years in order to increase oil production from 15 of its largest fields. The oil major has informed the petroleum ministry that it hopes to enhance the ultimate recovery from these fields by 4 to 5 per cent in the first stage.

 These fresh investments had become necessary to get more oil out of these ageing fields, which include Mumbai High, Heera, Neelam and Gandhar. The 15 large fields account for as much as 80 per cent of ONGC?s output of crude oil. The incremental crude oil expected from these redevelopment schemes is likely to be around 120 million tonnes by 2030, half of which would be from Mumbai High. 

 The total work, incorporating innovative technological solutions, includes upgrading the production facilities, laying pipelines and drilling new development wells. Side tracking of existing wells, zone transfers, gas and water shut off jobs and optimisation of artificial lift systems are also being undertaken to enhance the crude output. 

 Redevelopment of these large fields is part of the ONGC strategy to raise the nation?s crude output, which has been stagnating at around 32 million tonnes in recent years. 

 Some of the redevelopment schemes have already been completed as part of the initial Rs 12,097-crore plan, of which Rs 5,504 crore has been spent in the first three years of the Tenth Plan. 

 The oil major had come under fire in the past and had been accused of flogging the Mumbai High fields when the output from them had started to decline. Some predatory foreign companies had even made an attempt to take over the fields on the grounds that they could manage them better than ONGC. 

 However, the ONGC management had stood its ground and opted to hire foreign consultants in the mid-nineties to assess the western offshore fields. These experts had come to the conclusion that there was nothing wrong in the way in which ONGC had tapped these fields as ageing was a worldwide phenomenon. They had also said the output of oilfields in the UK?s North Sea had declined in the same manner. 

 The report had highlighted the fact that fresh investments had to be made to redevelop old fields in order to get more oil out of them.

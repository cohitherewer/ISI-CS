 TCS third-quarter profit at Rs 643 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 13: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) today said its net profit was Rs 643.81 crore in the third quarter and Rs 1404.72 crore in the nine months to December.

 Revenues, based on the US GAAP standards, were at Rs 2578.4 crore. This showed a rise of 38.2 per cent from Rs 1866 crore in the same quarter of the previous year and 6.1 per cent from Rs 2430.7 crore in the three months to September 2004.

 The Tata group company, listed last year and on its way to the premier nifty index, made a foreign exchange gain of Rs 78.88 crore, thanks to dollar hedging.

 ?We are seeing good demand and billing rates for our high-value offerings and there is a healthy pipeline,? chief executive S. Ramadorai said soon after the results.

 The third-quarter results come a day after Infosys logged a 51 per cent jump in third-quarter profit. Among the major problems faced by local software companies in the recent past is the fluctuation in the foreign exchange rate as the rupee gets stronger against the dollar.

 A senior company official said that TCS expects higher prices for some services, but pricing was ?stable? for most others. The firm added 2733 employees during the quarter , taking the total number to 43681. The rate of attrition was 7.6 per cent at TCS subsidiaries.

 Shares of TCS, which peaked at Rs 1335 today, ended at Rs 1293.05 in a marginal fall of Rs 4.15 from Wednesday?s close of Rs 1297.20. It came even as the other technology shares gained and market sentiment improved.

 TCS added 72 new clients during the quarter, taking the number to 506. In a coup of sorts, Ferrari chose TCS as its strategic partner to provide IT and engineering services. 

 The Tata group firm will offer core engine design services to the auto-racing icon. It also bagged significant deals with major studios in the media and entertainment industry.

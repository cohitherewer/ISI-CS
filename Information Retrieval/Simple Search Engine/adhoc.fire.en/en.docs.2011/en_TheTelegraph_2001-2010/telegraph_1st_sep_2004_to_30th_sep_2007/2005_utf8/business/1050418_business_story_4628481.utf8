 VSNL fears customer exodus

 Mumbai, April 17 (PTI): Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) fears a churn in customers following a Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) order to co-locate client routers on its premises and has requested the regulator to provide a level-playing field.

 The Tata-group managed company, in a letter, lamented that the regulator is yet to issue similar orders to other Internet service providers (ISPs) and international long distance operators, which may result in its customers moving over to other service providers.

 Trai is yet to issue orders to other ISPs and international long distance operators, despite several reminders from the company, even as the authority has repeatedly asked it to co-locate routers with its clients, VSNL said in the letter dated April 11, 2005.

 Earlier, Trai in its letter dated April 8, 2005, said VSNL has not provisioned international bandwidth to ISPs in a non-discriminatory manner and some of them were provisioned international private leased line circuits without co-locating a router on its premises.

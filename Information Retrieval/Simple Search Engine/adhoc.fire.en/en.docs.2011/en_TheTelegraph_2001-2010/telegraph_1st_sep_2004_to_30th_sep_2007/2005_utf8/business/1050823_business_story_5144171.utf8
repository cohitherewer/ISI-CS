 My dream has come true: Sukh Ram

 Ram: Has reasons to smile 

 Former Union communications minister Sukh Ram (1991-95), who kick-started the telecom revolution in the country, is a forgotten man today. Mired in a controversy over telecom deals clinched during his tenure, Ram has had a chequered political career. But he isnt embittered by the travails he has suffered. He is contented with the fact that he played a vital role in ushering in a revolution. In a free-wheeling interview with M Rajendran, Ram talks about the revolution he engendered and gives his views on the hot-button issues of today.

 Q:You are credited with kick-starting the telecom revolution in India. Do you think the targets set by you have been achieved?

 A: At that time (when mobile telephony was launched), only two private operators in fixed-line and mobile services were allowed in one circle. I am glad my dream of telecom connectivity for the country has come true. I am satisfied, despite the heavy odds, that my contribution as a telecom minister has borne fruit. 

 Q: What problems did you encounter while framing the telecom policy?

 A: There was one major problem. The bureaucrats were insisting that the equity participation of multinationals should be more than 50 per cent, while I wanted Indian companies to hold over 50 per cent. The then Prime Minister, P.V. Narasimha Rao, was afraid that we would not get the investment if we offered lower equity to MNCs. To allay his fears, and with his permission, I toured all the advanced countries and persuaded them to see my point of view. I succeeded in bringing about 35 companies, including firms from the US, to invest in India. They agreed to work within a framework where Indians would hold over 50 per cent equity. 

 Q: You had faced a lot of criticism during the tendering process. You were also engulfed in a controversy about kickbacks. How do you look back at that episode?

 A: I am thankful to the media that the incident had made me a man not only of national importance but also international. The credit goes to media. I feel it was due to a bad start I made. But today I have no complaints either against the media or anybody else.

 Q: Do you feel telecom prices have come down drastically?

 A: The prices will come down further. When I was in the UK, I saw operators granting free calls in the evening. Here also mobile phones will become cheaper. Competition will drive towards that and the fittest will survive.

 Q: Do you have a message for telecom operators on the completion of 10 years of mobile phone in India?

 A: My message to operators is forget about big profits. Small profits will make significant contributions because our country is big. It is only next to China in terms of opportunities available. So, they should look at rural markets where even a few lakh lines would generate good profits.

 Q:What is your message to the government on FDI?

 A: It is my belief that telecommunications is the biggest revenue earner for the country. If we give 74 per cent to MNCs, a lot of money is likely to go out. I am sure that the government has taken precautions to ensure that the outflow is less.

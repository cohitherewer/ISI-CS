 Rating on LKB bond issue lowered

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 24: CARE has downgraded the rating assigned to the Rs 50.7-crore tier-II bond issue of Lord Krishna Bank (LKB) to ?A-? from ?A?.

 Instruments with this rating are considered to be upper-medium grade and have many favourable investment attributes.

 While the safety for principal and interest are considered adequate, the rating also factors in the bank?s small size, sharp decline in overall profitability in the current fiscal, high net non-performing assets and lower spreads, a CARE release said.

 The rating also takes into account aspects like well spread out advances portfolio, relatively good technology orientation and recently completed rights issue to augment its tier-I equity base, the release said.

 LKB is a private sector bank, headquartered in Cochin. Its branch network has increased to 110 in October last year from 101 in early 2004. The bank continues to show a regional nature, though all the new branches are located outside Kerala, CARE added.

 According to the rating agency, the asset quality of LKB continued to remain moderate and has shown only marginal improvement between March 2003 and March 2004. Gross and net non-performing assets (NPAs), which were at 8.32 per cent and 6.05 per cent respectively, are higher than the industry average, CARE said. It said the asset quality of the bank further deteriorated in September.

 The investment losses suffered in the first half of 2005 have strained the bank?s financials, CARE said. However, the capital adequacy position of the bank is set to improve with the recent rights issue.

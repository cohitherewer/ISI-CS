 Syndicate ready with second public offer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 19: Syndicate Bank will visit the capital market for a second time with its proposed issue of 5 crore equity shares of Rs 10 each.

 ?The bank has filed a draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi),? the bank said today.

 ?The issue is being made to augment the capital requirements in keeping with Basel II norms as also meet our future growth objectives,? said N. Kantha Kumar, chairman and managing director of the bank.

 The public sector bank proposes to issue the shares at a premium which will be decided through the 100 per cent book building process.

 The bank has reserved 50 lakh shares for its employees and another 50 lakh for shareholders.

 Of the balance net offer of 4 crore shares, the bank has reserved 2 crore for qualified institutional buyers on a discretionary basis and 60 lakh shares for non-institutional buyers. The balance 1.4 crore shares will be allotted to retail investors on a proportionate basis, it said.

 The bank has appointed SBI Capital Markets, Enam Financial Consultants, JM Morgan Stanley and SSKI as book running lead managers for the issue.

 The bank had raised Rs 125 crore through its initial public offer in 1999. 

 D. C. Pai, general manager (treasury and international banking), said post-issue, the government holding in the bank will come down to 66 per cent from 73 per cent. The capital adequacy ratio of the bank is now at 11.54 per cent.

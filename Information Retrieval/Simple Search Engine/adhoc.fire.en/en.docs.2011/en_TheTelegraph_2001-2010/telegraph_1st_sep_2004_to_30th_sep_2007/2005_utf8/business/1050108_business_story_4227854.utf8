 Pension funds at core of growth

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: Long-term savings under the new pension system will boost the capital markets and speed up infrastructure development in the country.

 ?Research shows accumulated pension funds may have a positive impact on the development of the capital market,? said Robert Palacios, senior World Bank economist, at a seminar on second generation financial reforms.

 Industry too believes that as India lacks long-term funds a growing pension corpus will be a helpful resource for infrastructure development.

 However, analysts said right pricing of infrastructure loans could be the key to the problem of slow-paced growth. 

 ?In the larger economics of high and volatile risks, those funds should be given out at right prices,? said Anuroop Tony Singh, managing director of Max NewYork Life Insurance, one of the private sector players keen to enter the pensions business.

 Stating that pension reforms in India will have a wider implication on fiscal and social policy and overall financial sector development, Palacios said both the Centre and states realise that ?the new pension scheme will ease financial liability?.

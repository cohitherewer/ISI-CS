The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 RINL added to merger menu

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, June 2: The cabinet meeting scheduled to discuss IISCOs merger will also take up Rashtriya Ispat Nigams case.

 Taking advantage of a one-day postponement of the meeting, the ministry has included this on the agenda. The meet was earlier supposed to discuss only IISCOs merger with SAIL.

 Senior officials, however, said the cabinet is likely to take up the pricing of petro products first. The mergers would be discussed only if the cabinet has time. 

 If discussions on other more urgent issues takes up most of the allotted time, the mergers would be discussed at the next meeting ... otherwise, it (cabinet) will try to consider them together, they said.

 As reported by The Telegraph last month, the government wants Rashtriya Ispat to be also merged with SAIL to create a steel behemoth. 

 The new entity would have a combined crude steel production of 15.8 MT, making it the tenth-largest global steel-maker. 

 If IISCO is also merged with SAIL, the combined production would go up to 16.2 MT ? higher than ThyssenKrupp of Germany, currently the ninth-largest. 

 The cabinet note on the IISCO merger is based on the governments belief that with steel prices ruling at all-time highs and with the SAIL subsidiary back in the black after decades, this is the right time to merge the firm with its parent and revive it.

 Calcutta, July 6: With infrastructure projects getting a big boost in the country, city-based Subhash Projects and Marketing Ltd (SPML) is eyeing a four-fold increase in its business in the next two years.

 Engaged in developing projects for industrial, power, water management and urban infrastructure, the company already has a healthy order book position, which is expected to grow more going forward. 

 Subhash Projects sees big business opportunities emerging from the power sector reforms in particular. 

 It has pending project orders worth of Rs 1,200 crore, of which Rs 500 crore from power sector itself. The projects are to be completed by March 2007.

 We are about to get Rs 300 crore project order in next couple of months from different power utilities in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Karnataka, said S.C. Sethi, vice chairman, Subhash Projects and Marketing Ltd. The governments renewed thrust on rural eletrification programme ? providing electricity to every village of the country ? has thrown up huge opportunities for companies like SPML which execute projects on behalf of different power utilities.

 Besides building transmission projects for others, the company has forayed into generating electricity by its own with various subsidiaries. Its subsidiary company, Subhas Kabini Projects, has a power trading licence. 

 Subhash Projects runs a 20-megawatt hydel power plant in Karnataka and has embarked upon seven mini hydel power projects with an investment of Rs 300 crore in Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal. The financial closure for the Himachal units has already been done.

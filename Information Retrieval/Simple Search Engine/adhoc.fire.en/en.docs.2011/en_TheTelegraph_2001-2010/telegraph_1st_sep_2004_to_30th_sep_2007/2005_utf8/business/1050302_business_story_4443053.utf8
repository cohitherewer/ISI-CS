 Bank stake cut looms large

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 1: The Reserve Bank of India?s (RBI) roadmap for foreign banks may force HSBC and ICICI Bank to dilute their stake in UTI Bank and Federal Bank respectively.

 In its roadmap announced on Monday, the central bank reiterated the position it took last year that banks, including foreign ones, with branches in India should not acquire stake in peers in excess of 5 per cent of its equity.

 The central bank had, in July last year, come out with a draft policy framework on ownership of private sector banks. It was felt that even promoters of other private sector banks, such as Bank of Rajasthan and HDFC Bank, would have to dilute their shareholding to 5 per cent.

 However, RBI officials clarified that there is no ?hard and fast rule? on the issue. The main objective is that key shareholders of a bank should be ?fit and proper?.

 The Reserve Bank further added that where the ownership is that of a corporate entity, the goal will be to ensure that no single individual or entity has ownership and control in excess of 10 per cent of a bank.

 HSBC was earlier allowed by the central bank to pick up only a 14.62 per cent stake in the bank though it had applied for purchasing 19.96 per cent from Actis. 

 An HSBC spokesperson said since the Reserve Bank notification has just been issued, the global financial major will take a view on it after going through in detail.

 On the other hand, ICICI Bank has said in the past that it harbours no intention of acquiring control of the Kerala-based Federal Bank and that it would bring down its holding to 5 per cent within a definite timeframe. 

 According to the two-phase roadmap announced on Monday, foreign banks will initially be permitted to acquire a controlling stake in ?select private sector banks? identified by the Reserve Bank of India for restructuring.

 Bank watchers say that in the first phase, only weak private sector banks which lack capital or have other problems such as high non-performing assets (NPAs) are likely to be picked. 

 However, sources at the central bank said it would not be putting out a list of such banks in the public domain. They made it clear that the process would be ?mutual?. ?For instance, if a private sector bank is looking for divesting some stake to a foreign bank, it may also approach us,? the sources added.

 In view of the RBI confining takeover targets only to those identified by it for restructuring, it is felt that merger activity among private banks led by foreign majors will take some more time to start. 

 Officials of foreign banks The Telegraph spoke to said they would wait for the identification of acquisition targets by the central bank before taking a call on expanding via the inorganic route.

 Neel Chatterjee, senior vice-president (corporate affairs) of Standard Chartered Bank welcomed the RBI roadmap, saying the path is now clear as there is more clarity.

 Islamabad, June 7: Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf today gave the go-ahead for accelerating the official level talks on the proposed Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline so that all the preliminary matters relating to the project are settled by the year-end. 

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar told reporters after an hour-long meeting with Musharraf that the Pakistani President had welcomed our attempts to accelerate the pace of the talks on the pipeline and gave his blessings to conclude all preliminary matters of discussion by the year-end.

 Musharraf also told Aiyar that he had no objections to India joining the proposed Qatar-Pakistan pipeline project and the Indian government could directly take up the issue with Qatar.

 Musharraf has just returned from Qatar where he discussed the import of natural gas from the Gulf kingdom both through a pipeline and in its liquefied form as LNG. Pakistan has already agreed to invite India to join the proposed gas pipeline from Turkmenistan. 

 Aiyar had expressed Indias desire to join the pipeline project during his meeting with Musharraf. 

 The minister said discussions on the three transnational gas pipeline projects through Pakistan would proceed along the fast track but it does seem at the moment that talks on the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline will take off first.

 Aiyar said his trip to Pakistan had concluded on a successful note. The petroleum ministers of the two countries issued a joint communiqu? giving top priority to the transnational pipeline projects as there would be substantial advantage to both countries in pursuing and realising co-operation in these projects to serve their energy security interests.

 The two countries have also agreed to exchange information regarding financial structuring, technical, commercial, legal and related issues to realise a safe and secure world-class project.

 The joint working group at the secretary level will meet regularly and report progress to the ministers to facilitate decisions by them at the earliest, the statement said. 

 Aiyar played down the issue of US opposition to the proposed pipeline from Iran, saying this aspect did not even come up for discussion during his talks with Musharraf.

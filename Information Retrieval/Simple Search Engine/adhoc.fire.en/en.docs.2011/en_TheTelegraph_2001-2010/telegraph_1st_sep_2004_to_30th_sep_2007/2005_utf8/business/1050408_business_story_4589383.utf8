 A marble palace to call home

 Bang opposite the Mercedes Benz showroom in the heart of the tony part of the city sits this plush complex.

 Developed by the Belani Group, the 3,500-sq-ft apartments (three or four bedrooms) in shining Italian marble housed within the prime property designed by architect Dulal Mukherjee is a real object of desire. 

 The complex has a swimming pool, a tennis court, a gym and accoutrements like video-door phone, glass-back lifts, air-conditioned lobby and community hall.

 The 1,000-sq-ft-plus living-dining hall is flexible and the space can be altered according to the needs of the family. There?s a special area to house a bar counter and a sit-out balcony for cool summer evenings. The 150-sq-ft kitchen has a service balcony, which can act as a utility room for the washing machine, ironing and drying.

 Visitors? parking, another rarity, adds value to Belmont, as does the clearance on three sides with an uninterrupted view and wind channels. Teakwood frames and doors, modular switches, separate play arena for the children and a vitrified lobby are the other embellishments.

 ?We have conceived Belmont with the idea of providing all facilities within the complex. This is the first step towards lifestyle buildings in a smaller format,? says Nandu Belani, head of the Belani Group.

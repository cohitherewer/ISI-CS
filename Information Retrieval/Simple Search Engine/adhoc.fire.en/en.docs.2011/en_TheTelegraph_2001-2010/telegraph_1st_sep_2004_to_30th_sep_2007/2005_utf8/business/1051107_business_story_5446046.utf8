 Trade warriors square off in London

 Geneva, Nov. 6 (AFP): The big hitters of global commerce gathering in London tomorrow bear a heavy responsibility ? settle their differences in WTO talks or leave the negotiations mired.

 As India, Brazil, the European Union, Japan and the United States joust over the give and take, the EU in particular must avoid a repeat of past mistakes that fuelled the collapse of a WTO summit two years ago, analysts said.

 US trade representative Rob Portman has billed tomorrows talks with his EU counterpart Peter Mandelson, Indias commerce minister Kamal Nath, Brazils foreign minister Celso Amorim and Japans trade minister Toshihiro Nikai as a last-ditch effort to salvage the WTOs flagging, four-year old negotiations.

 WTO chief Pascal Lamy, who is desperately trying to broker a compromise, said the officials have to make a judgment on the red lines of their trade partners.

 They will have to start discussing trade-offs, he said.

 According to Sergio Marchi, who previously served as canadas WTO ambassador and led the global bodys ruling general council, tomorrows talks could play a pivotal role because most of the heavy lifting gets done in the world of informal side meetings.

 Then it feeds into the regular, formal process something that has already been cooked and tasted and therefore is probably a lot more palatable to the wider group, Marchi said.

 The WTO wants a detailed draft deal to be agreed at a ministerial meeting in Hong Kong in mid-December. Estimates for the benefits for the world economy range from tens to hundreds of billions of dollars, with the biggest impact from a successful round coming in agriculture.

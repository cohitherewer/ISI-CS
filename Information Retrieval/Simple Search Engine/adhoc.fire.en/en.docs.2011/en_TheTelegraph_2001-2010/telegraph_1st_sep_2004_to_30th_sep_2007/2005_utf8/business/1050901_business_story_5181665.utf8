 Calcutta, Aug. 31: Tata Ryerson Ltd, a 50:50 joint venture between Tata Steel and the US-based Ryerson Tull, is exploring opportunities to expand overseas. 

 The company, which till date has its steel processing operations confined only within the country, is eyeing burgeoning economies like China and Thailand, where demand for steel and its production both are growing at fantastic pace, for expansion.

 The two promoter companies and the management team of Tata Ryerson are looking at various options at the moment, said Sandipan Chakravorty, managing director of the company. 

 Chakravorty was, however, quick to add that the idea was still at a nascent stage.

 Meanwhile, Ryerson Tull ? the US partner in the joint venture ? is keen on taking Tata Ryerson outside India and set up shops in countries like China to get a slice of the growing steel market there and other South-East Asian countries. China is almost four times bigger than India in terms of steel production.

 But Tata Steel is more interested in exploiting the opportunities at home ? Indian steel production is set to double in the next five years. 

 Furthermore, as and when Tata Steel acquires an overseas company ? as it has said it would ? Tata Ryerson may follow the parent in that country.

 Back home, Tata Ryerson is planning a new processing centre in the southern region ? either in Chennai or in Bangalore. 

 There is a big demand coming from the construction industry there, Chakravorty explained. We are examining the implications of value-added tax before deciding on the location, he added. 

 The southern facility will primarily be a steel plate processing unit. 

 Tata Ryerson is also installing cold rolling facilities at its Faridabad and Pune plants.

 These are all parts of the companys plan to increase its processing capacity from 1.2 million tonnes at present to 2 million tonnes by 2010.

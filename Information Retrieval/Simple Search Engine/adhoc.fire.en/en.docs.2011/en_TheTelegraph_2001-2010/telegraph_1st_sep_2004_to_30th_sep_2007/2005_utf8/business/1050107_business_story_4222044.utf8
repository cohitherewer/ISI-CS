 New Delhi, Jan 6: India today asked major oil producing and consuming nations to develop an Asian oil market, which would be bound by long-term and possibly cheaper oil supplies as a means to stabilise a volatile market.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar, speaking at the first-ever roundtable of Asian ministers on regional co-operation in the oil economy here, said, ?For us in Asia, to convert that underlying stability in production into stability in oil markets, it is essential that we develop a sophisticated Asian market for petroleum and petroleum products.? 

 Analysts saw it as a bid by India to form a buyers? cartel along with Japan and China, which could pressurise oil producers to offer the commodity at prices comparable to those offered to Europe and the US.

 In recent years, India and China have become big buyers in the oil market, while Japan has been a major importer of oil all along. West European and US buyers are able to negotiate far lower prices than most countries because of their buying muscle. 

 However, unlike Europe and the US, India and Japan do not have significant oil producing areas. Hence, their bargaining position is seen weaker against the oil cartel of Opec nations. 

 The roundtable brought together major oil producers ? Saudi Arabia, Iran, Kuwait, UAE, Oman and Qatar ? and major consuming countries ? India, China, Japan, Korea and Malaysia. 

 Asia?s total consumption almost equals production in the region. But unlike North America and Europe, Asia lacks a developed oil market. The Indian government pitched for long-term crude oil supply contracts and mutual investments in upstream by consuming countries and downstream by producing countries to enhance stability and security.

 India is hosting the roundtable ostensibly to discuss stability, security and sustainability of oil supplies. It also sought mutual co-operation in developing emergency response mechanism by building storages in countries where the demand is high to ensure there is no shortage of fuel even during disruptions. 

 Despite the size and importance of the Asian market, pricing of oil in the continent is dependent on less-than-satisfactory crude pricing markets, namely Tapis, Minas and Dubai, making the market signals not very efficient, Aiyar said.

 There was an immediate need to develop the oil market to ensure correct pricing of both crude and products, he added.

 The minister said there was a need to think of an Asian market where long-term contracts become longer and where price discovery through the market is more transparent. 

 ?As a joint emergency response mechanism, perhaps we should consider jointly building storages, which would enable consumers to enjoy an uninterrupted flow of supplies and producers to enjoy an uninterrupted flow of oil revenue till normalcy is restored,? he added.

 Calling for interdependence through mutual investments by producer and consumer countries of the Asian oil community, Aiyar said an estimated $1,580 billion investment over the next 25 years was needed in the oil economy in Asian countries.

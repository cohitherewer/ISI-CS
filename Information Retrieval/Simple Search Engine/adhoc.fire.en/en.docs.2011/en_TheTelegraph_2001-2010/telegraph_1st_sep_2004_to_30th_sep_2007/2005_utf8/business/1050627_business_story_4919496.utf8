 Anil rings in Infocomm rejig

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 26: Anil Ambani today took the reins at Reliance Infocomm in a change of guard that saw brother Mukeshs men making way for those picked by Ambani junior.

 The move marked the beginning of a realignment at the telecom majors board, which also accepted the resignation of Mukesh as founder-chairman and five other directors.

 Anand Jain, Manoj Modi, Bharat Goenka, Y. P. Trivedi and M. P. Modi made their way out while Anil nominees ? chartered accountant Gautam Doshi and IIM Bangalore professor J. Ramachandran ? joined the team.

 Among the board members who left, Trivedi and Modi were inducted only on December 27 last year ? at the height of the ownership battle between Anil and Mukesh.

 Anil addressed the 40,000 Infocomm staff, who were exhorted through a webcast to focus on profitable growth and creating value for customers. Reliance Infocomm has both energy and capital and I want growth with profitability and revenues, Anil said after taking over. 

 Anil complemented Mukesh ? who had to part with Reliance Infocomm in the family settlement ? for creating world-class infrastructure at the Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City, and providing him an opportunity to lead it. He appealed to employees for support, commitment and trust to establish Infocomm as a market leader.

 Infocomm has grabbed 21 per cent of the mobile telephony market but, in its dash for growth, drawn fire from regulators for allegedly routing international calls as local ones. 

 Over the past few months, Anil targeted Mukesh over the ownership of Reliance Infocomm equity in a campaign that eventually forced Ambani senior to renounce his sweat equity worth 10 per cent of the firms shares. Mukesh and his associates were believed to own at least 50 per cent of Reliance Infocomm at one point of time.

 Anil has been preparing the ground for his takeover of the groups telecom company. Last week, he met communications and IT minister Dayanidhi Maran. In the past, he has held talks with the Trai chief.

 Analysts are watching for signals that he sends out on Infocomms future plans and his ideas about a possible maiden public offering of shares.

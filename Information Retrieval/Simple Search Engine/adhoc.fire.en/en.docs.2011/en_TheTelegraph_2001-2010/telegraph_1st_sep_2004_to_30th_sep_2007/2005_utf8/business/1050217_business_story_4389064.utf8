 Matrix gets Rs 75 cr from patent suit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 16: Matrix Laboratories Ltd has received Rs 75 crore as part payment towards the settlement of a potential patent infringement suit.

 This is the highest amount ever received by a domestic pharmaceutical company. It comes at a time when many drug companies are feeling the heat after losing cases in the US courts for patent ownership.

 The Hyderabad-based pharma major has informed the National Stock Exchange that of the estimated consideration of Rs 95 crore towards the settlement of a potential patent infringement suit, it had received Rs 75 crore as part payment. 

 Matrix declined to reveal the name of the firm, which had filed the patent infringement suit. The company said it was prohibited from disclosing the details of the firm that coughed up the money and also the drug.

 For Matrix, this is the next big success after the Citalopram suit. Last fiscal, Danish pharmaceutical giant Lundbeck, the innovator of the anti-depressant Citalopram, had withdrawn patent infringement cases against Matrix and its customers in the European courts.

 Matrix has been supplying Citalopram in the active pharmaceutical ingredient form to two of its major generic customers in the European markets ? Ratiopharm and Destin Pharma.

 Following the development, Matrix recorded a significant increase in Citalopram exports to the European markets.

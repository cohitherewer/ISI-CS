 India Inc for more leeway on directors

 Irani: Tough act to follow

 New Delhi, June 26: India Inc is unhappy with the suggestions made by the JJ Irani committee to overhaul the Companies Act.

 The Irani committee had recently come up with suggestions that differed from the Securities and Exchange Board of Indias (Sebi) plan to make it mandatory for companies to have 50 per cent of their board members as independent directors. Sebi wanted to enforce this by December.

 The Irani committee brought this limit to one-third of the board.

 A survey conducted by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) covering finance directors, company secretaries, chartered accountants and legal experts of large, medium and small companies has thrown up India Incs demands before Parliament puts its stamp of approval on a legislation seeking to overhaul the Companies Act.

 Industry wants the new companies bill to be flexible in allowing the company boardrooms to decide on the number of independent directors for effective corporate governance.

 Companies also do not want any restriction on the number of directors. The Irani committee wanted to cap it at 15, which is retrograde and goes against the underlying philosophy of corporate democracy, the survey said. 

 The respondents to the survey feel that if the government believes that such a provision should be there in the law, the limit should be substantially raised or at least restored to 20, as was the position prior to the Companies (Amendment) Act 2000.

 It is normal for the chairman or individual business entrepreneurs for both strategic and symbolic reasons to be on the board of each of the group companies and the law should not seek to place artificial restrictions in this regard, the survey pointed out.

 The survey said, No country in the world has such restrictions and there is no reason to have a different treatment in ours.

 Industry said recommendations should provide adequate flexibility for timely evolution needed in the ever-changing business models and facilitate the adoption of globally accepted best practices.

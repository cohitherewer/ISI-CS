 Clock is ticking on oil price increase

 Kumbakonam, March 20 (PTI): Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today said the cabinet would decide on increasing the prices of diesel and petrol at its meeting next week. 

 The minister maintained that raising the rates of the two auto fuels was inevitable in view of the rising crude prices, which had touched $56.72 a barrel on Friday. The oil companies are not able to manage the mounting losses, he told reporters here.

 Heavy import of crude and the steep hike in the cost of operating the refineries are the main reasons, which had led to the present situation, he added. 

 The cabinet is likely to consider raising petrol prices by Rs 2.80 per litre and diesel by about Rs 2 per litre.

 The Indian basket of crude had touched a record high of $51.64 a barrel.

 ?This hike is being proposed to be effected in two stages. The first on April 1 and the second on May 1,? a senior government official said in Delhi.

 IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corp and Hindustan Petroleum Corp have sought a Rs 3.50 per litre and Rs 2.80 per litre hike in petrol and diesel prices respectively, the official said.

 Oil majors are also claiming an additional Rs 1.50 per litre increase to compensate for the extra investment they have incurred for producing cleaner Euro-III grade petrol and diesel for 11 major cities and the Euro-II grade for the rest of the country.

 The oil companies have invested over Rs 40,000 crore for upgrading the fuel quality.

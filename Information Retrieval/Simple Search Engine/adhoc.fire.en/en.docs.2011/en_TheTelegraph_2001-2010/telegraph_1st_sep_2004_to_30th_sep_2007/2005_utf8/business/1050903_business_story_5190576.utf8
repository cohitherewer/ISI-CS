 GTL ready to hang up on call centre

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Testing times 

 Mumbai, Sept. 2: In what may sound like a warning for the fledgling business process outsourcing sector, GTL Ltd today said it was re-evaluating its voice-based third-party call centre business as it has lost much of its edge.

 GTL, formerly called Global Telesystems, avers that the Indian call centre industry is at a critical juncture and the intense competition in the sector has led to lower billing rates, particularly in the voice-based business. The company, however, expects that its total revenues may cross Rs 890 crore this fiscal. 

 The company is in a transition phase and we are re-evaluating our voice-based business, GTL told stock exchanges. 

 GTL now intends to migrate from predominantly voice-based services to technical support services for network management and processes. It is one of the many companies that have set up call-centre operations following the BPO boom. 

 Analysts also agree that the countrys flourishing call-centre business, which is perceived as a lower link in the value chain, is likely to witness a massive churn over the coming months as the revenues of the BPO companies have already started taking a hit due to cut-throat competition.

 GTL also informed the stock exchanges that it has appointed Delloite and RSM to guide it in restructuring their voice-based call centre business into providing services for network and infrastructure management.

 The move comes in the wake of the recently formed GTL Infrastructure Ltd, a 100 per cent subsidiary of GTL. 

 According to the plan, GTL intends to bring all its service offerings under one platform and provide it as a unified service. As a network service provider post-restructuring, GTL will focus on telecom OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), operators, multi-national companies and large enterprises. 

 The company will also provide shared infrastructure assets to telecom operators and IT-enabled service providers.

 GTL now possesses infrastructure assets that include nodes at various cities in the country, data centres, international gateways, networking and other equipment. These assets will now be transferred to GTL Infrastructure for optimum utilisation catering to telecom operators and IT-enabled services companies on a shared basis, GTL said.

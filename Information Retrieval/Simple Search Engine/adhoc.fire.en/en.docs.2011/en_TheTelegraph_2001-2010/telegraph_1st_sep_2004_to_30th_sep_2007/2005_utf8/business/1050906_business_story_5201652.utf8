 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 5: The Usha Martin board has approved the issue of global depository receipts (GDRs) or foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) of up to $25 million (Rs 110 crore) with a greenshoe option of 20 per cent.

 The GDRs or FCCBs will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.

 The board has cleared the proposal to offer a preferential issue of 58 lakh convertible warrants to the promoters. 

 According to Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) guidelines, each warrant will be priced at Rs 153 for a share of Rs 5 each.

 The proposed allottees have agreed to subscribe to the warrants at the above price by paying 10 per cent upfront. They can exercise the option to convert the warrants into shares by paying the balance 90 per cent.

 The shares allotted will be subject to a lock-in of three years from the date of issue of warrants. ICICI Securities has been appointed as the lead manager. An extraordinary general meeting has been convened on September 28 to seek shareholders approval.

 The company proposes to fund its capacity expansion programme through a combination of GDRs, convertible warrants, internal accruals and debt. 

 The board has approved a capital expenditure plan of Rs 462 crore to strengthen the wire and wire rope business and to expand the steel capacity to half-a-million tonnes and also for iron ore and coal mining. The company has already got a 20-year lease registered for mining iron ore in Jharkhand.

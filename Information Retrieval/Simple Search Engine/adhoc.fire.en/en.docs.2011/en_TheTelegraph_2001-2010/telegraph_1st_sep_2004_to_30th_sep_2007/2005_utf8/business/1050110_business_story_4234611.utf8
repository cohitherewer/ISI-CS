 Pension regulator to get going this month

 New Delhi, Jan. 9 (PTI): The government will appoint the chairman and members of the pension fund regulator within this month.

 ?The chairman and members of the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) will be finalised soon and the regulator will be in place within a couple of weeks,? a senior finance ministry official said.

 The government had promulgated an ordinance on December 29 to set up the body. The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill will be introduced in the budget session.

 Financial sector secretary N. S. Sisodia is among the contenders for the post of the chairman. Sisodia is expected to retire soon but not before the budget exercise is over.

 The guidelines for the new pension system, appointment of fund managers and the central record-keeping and accounting agency would be framed by the end of this year, the official said.

 Apart from meeting minimum capital requirements and having an experience of five years, pension fund managers would be selected on the basis of cost and fees they propose to charge.

 The government favours a limited number of fund managers.

 It expects reforms to make the pension business vibrant and second only to banking in the next 5-7 years.

 ?Considering the volume of transactions and funds flowing into the sector, it was thought necessary to have a separate regulator. Six states have already decided to join the new pension system,? the official said.

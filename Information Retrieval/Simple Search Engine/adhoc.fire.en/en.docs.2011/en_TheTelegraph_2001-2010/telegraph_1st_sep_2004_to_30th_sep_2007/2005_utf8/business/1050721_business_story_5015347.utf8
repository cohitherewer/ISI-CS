 More skeletons pop out of VW boot

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Hyderabad, July 20: Andhra Pradesh state finance minister K. Rosaiah had sensed a whiff of a scandal in the payout of Rs 11.5 crore (2.1 million euros) to Vashistha Wahan, the special purpose vehicle formed by sacked Volkswagen executive Helmuth Schuster. 

 It virtually accounts to bribing and not equity participation, he is believed to have written in a note on the file relating to the VW proposal seeking to locate its car assembly plant in Visakhapatnam. 

 Schuster had insisted on the upfront payment as a sign of the state governments commitment to the project. It was supposed to form a part of the equity contribution by the state government to the project. 

 Rosaiah was right: the scandal blew up into a major controversy in Germany and forced the Wolfsburg-based carmaker to force Schuster and several top executives out of the company. 

 Rosaiah was visibly irritated today when reporters asked him to comment on the VW scandal. He tersely said he was under oath to not say anything. 

 The Andhra Pradesh government is now keen to retrieve the project over which a cloud of uncertainty now hangs. 

 The state government has drafted a letter to the chief executive of Volkswagen AG seeking an appointment where state officials can discuss the modalities for establishing the carmakers venture in Visakhapatnam. 

 The German carmaker had reached an informal understanding with the state government on establishing the car venture in Vizag but the process went off the rails after a sex-and-sleaze scandal engulfed Schuster ? the chief negotiator of VWs proposal. Our focus now is towards getting the project to Andhra Pradesh, said D. Somayajulu, state adviser on economic affairs and investments.

 Somayajulu was closeted in a meeting with state industry secretary Lakshmi Parthasarathy and industry commissioner Sutirtha Bhattacharya who returned to Hyderabad yesterday after a holiday in the US. 

 Volkswagen has maintained a studied silence on the payout to Vashistha Wahan in what is perceived as an attempt to disclaim liability. 

 Clearly, the onus on retrieving the sum ? which reports say Schuster and his partners have siphoned away to Swiss banks ? now rests on the Andhra government. 

 The state bureaucrats who cleared the payout to the Vashistha Wahan had broken all the rules while clearing the file at breakneck speed on January 13 to ensure immediate payment to Vashishta Wahan.

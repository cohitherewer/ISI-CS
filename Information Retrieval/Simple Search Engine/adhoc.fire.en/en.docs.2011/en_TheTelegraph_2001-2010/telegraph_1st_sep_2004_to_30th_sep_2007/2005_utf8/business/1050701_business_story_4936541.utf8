 PSU preference blow adds fuel to Bhel fire

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, June 30: The cabinet today cleared a diluted purchase preference policy for state-run firms, restricting the privilege to tenders valued below Rs 100 crore and keeping Bharat Heavy Electricals (Bhel) out of the ambit.

 The decision means the electrical engineering giant will not have an edge in tenders floated by NTPC and NHPC. The Left had raised this possibility at a meeting with leaders of the ruling UPA on June 19. The parties said tweaking purchase preference in a way that hits Bhel gives the impression that someone is trying to make it sick and ensure its sale to a private bidder.

 RSP leader Abani Roy, among those who attended the last meeting of the Left-UPA co-ordination committee, said: We raised the issue of diluting PSU purchase preference, but were told by finance minister P. Chidambaram that the government had not taken a decision. Roy and his comrades are now furious at having been short-changed on the issue by the government.

 The Left has already served an ultimatum to the Congress-led government asking it to back off from selling a 10 per cent stake in Bhel, arguing that this was a prelude to it being hived off completely to a private bidder.

 The cabinet, however, did throw in a sop for Bhel, saying the ministry of power could place certain orders with it on a negotiated basis. The ministries of power and heavy industry will work out the number and value of such orders to be placed at the start of a year. 

 Senior Bhel officials say this may not be enough. Three quarters of its Rs 8,000-crore turnover comes from state-run power sector firms and a drop in deals from these entities under new rules will hit the PSU hard. 

 The policy so far was that a public sector enterprise was preferred if its bid was within 10 per cent of the lowest one in a tender. Todays cabinet decision also limits the chances of PSUs like SAIL, Mecon, Engineers India winning major contracts by setting the Rs 100-crore cap. 

 Roy says most tenders floated by IOC, ONGC, National Highway Authority and railways are worth more than Rs 100 crore. The new rules will shut out government-owned companies from these lucrative deals.

 These are firms with a high degree of competence. But since they are state-run firms and follow only ethical corporate practices, they will certainly lose out to MNCs or domestic private players who can form cartels to offer services at extremely low, and if need be, uneconomic prices. Those of us who have experience of the railways will tell you that PSU wagon builders have suffered from similar collusion in the past. Jessop or Burn Standard turned sick because of this practice, Roy said.

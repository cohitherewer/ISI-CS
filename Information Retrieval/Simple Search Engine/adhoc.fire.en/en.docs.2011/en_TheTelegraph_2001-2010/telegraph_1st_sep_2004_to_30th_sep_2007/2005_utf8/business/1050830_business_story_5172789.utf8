 FLAG restores cable service

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 29: FLAG Europe Asia (FEA) cable has returned to service and is operating normally, FLAG said today. 

 We are in the process of returning customer traffic from our restoration routes onto the cable. It is expected to be completed in the next one or two days, an official said. 

 FLAG has completed the repair work in record time, the official added. The FLAG Marine and Technical Sub-sea specialist groups worked closely with the repair contractor, E-Marine, and the Indian government to secure the necessary permits.

 During the entire operation, FLAGs priority was to support the customers and traffic was re-routed through the pre-planned and ad-hoc restoration routes. Though FLAGs preferred restoration cable was also cut, all customer requests for restoration were met, officials said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Travel light ?n? safe

 Lost in a lonesome city or out of cash, a travel insurance can help, says Chandralekha Tulal

 You are a wanderer at heart and love visiting exotic locations around the globe. Or maybe, you are a jet-setting businessman with appointments for breakfast in Calcutta, lunch in Dubai and clubbing in Paris. Or you might be a starry-eyed student, off to earn that much-desired foreign university degree.

 The last thing you would want in such circumstances is to fall sick and end up in a hospital or get robbed, leaving you stranded without money, passport and, perhaps, even a change of clothes.

 Nothing can make up for the disappointment in such a disaster, but at such times, an overseas travel insurance plan can be a god-send as it would offer financial assistance.

 Travel insurance has come a long way since the public sector insurers launched the first overseas medical insurance policy in 1997. With the entry of private players, what used to be a no-frills, limited-cover health insurance product, has now evolved into a complex plan covering a range of travel-related risks, targeting specific groups of travellers.

 What does it cover? 

 The common risks covered by individual plans are death or disablement due to personal accident, trip cancellation, hospitalisation expenses, loss of baggage and passport and legal liability towards a third party for unintentional loss of life or property during the course of overseas travel.

 Insurers offer covers ranging from $50,000 to $5,00,000 for tailor-made products, while a few firms allow you to choose the benefits. Most policies cover the common risks, but, a few firms offer some outlandish covers too. 

 Throwing a party?

 Bajaj Allianz reimburses the expenses incurred on throwing a party for achieving a hole-in-one in a game of golf during the trip. It also provides specific cover for Asian countries, excluding Japan. 

 Another offbeat cover is Emergency Cash Allowance. If you need emergency cash on theft or loss of luggage, the insurer will co-ordinate with your relatives in India to provide cash.

 For the student

 Some universities offer on-campus medical cover and though it seems convenient, these policies are actually more expensive than any other medical cover and are also limited in scope. Thus, it makes more sense to opt for a desi policy.

 What?s special about them is that in most cases, policies specifically address medical and non-medical risks and is available for the whole year. If, in case of sickness, a student is unable to continue his studies, the policy reimburses the tuition fee, normally paid in advance. Such policies also take into consideration a situation where a student is hospitalised for a week or more and requires a family member?s care. The cover offers a round-trip ticket for the family member along with an accommodation allowance. 

 Frequent fliers

 For frequent fliers whose destinations are decided at the eleventh hour, insurers offer policies that take into account multiple destinations, with multiple entries for a year. You pay a flat rate, instead of the piecemeal payments you make for duration-specific standalone policies. The extent of cover is higher than what is available in other overseas travel insurance policies. 

 Wanderlust

 Almost all travel agents have some arrangement with an insurer to sell policies to tourists. These are by and large no-frill policies that cover the cost of medical treatment and hospitalisation. 

 However, some companies offer what is called a ?floating? policy. In such a policy, the extent of cover can be transferred between family members. The advantage of such a policy is the lower premium you pay while retaining the extent of cover. You can include additional members at an extra cost, usually as a percentage of the base family premium. You can also include your parents in the scheme, subject to age limits.

 What?s the cost?

 The premium depends on your age, the period and the country of travel. Most companies have premiums for a fixed age group and travel periods. ICICI Lombard, however, charges on a daily basis.

 How to settle claims?

 When you want want to make a claim, you can call the helpline numbers and inform the company. Most companies offer a cashless settlement for hospitalisation, while some offer it if the expenses exceed a certain limit. 

 For instance, Royal Sundaram offers cashless settlement if the costs exceed $500. Expenses below $500 have to be settled by you and reimbursement sought later. Bajaj Allianz offers cashless settlement if hospitalised, but not for outpatient treatment.

 While submitting claims for lost baggage or passport, you have to produce a proof of the loss. You need to submit a copy of the complaint lodged with the local authorities. If it is a claim for a baggage delay, you need a certificate from the airport authority acknowledging the delay, which should be for at least 12 hours.

 A few pointers

 Before you sign on the dotted lines, be sure to find out more about the claim settlements, exclusions and other details.

 When settling claims, a certain portion has to be borne by you, which is called the deductible. If your actual expenses are within the deductible limits, you bear the cost and not the insurer. For instance, if there is a $2,500 claim, the insurer will pay only $2,400 and $100 would be the deductible. If, however, the claim is $75, the insurer does not pay anything. The deductible is mentioned for each of the risks covered. 

 It is wise to understand the exclusions and limits on each class of cover. Make sure you read the policy thoroughly, or you may end up paying the bill as well as the premium.

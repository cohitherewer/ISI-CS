The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Break in rally after new high

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 9: Dalal Street was pregnant with expectation as the stock market opened for trading today. There was promise and riding high on foreign investors? enthusiasm the sensex quickly raced to 6954.86, another all-time high. 

 It was just about 50 points short of the magic 7000-mark and excitement was running high when the balloon suddenly burst. 

 Some of the operators decided to book profit and pulled the sensex down from its pedestal. Thus the bellwether index, after a straight five-session rally that saw many records tumble, ended the day with a loss of 22 points at 6892.82.

 Unfazed by today?s minor jolt, many expect the sensex to cross the magic mark soon, with some brokerages even revising upwards their estimates to 8000 by next fiscal. 

 When the index was at its trapeze act today, managers of bulge-bracket funds from across the globe were listening to industrialists here narrate the ?emerging India? story in the city. 

 Leading FIIs like the government of Singapore, Merrill Lynch and HSBC attended the seminar organised by Morgan Stanley. A fund manager said nearly 100 FIIs took part as the Indian markets have suddenly come to the centrestage. 

 The BSE index fell 0.3 percent as big investors booked profits. It was a highly volatile session as the sensex hit an all-time high before falling apart. 

 ?It?s just a mild correction as these are new heights we have to get used to,? said a fund manager affiliated to a leading mutual fund.

 Some operators were restive with investors thinking twice before putting money at such untested levels. 

 Heavyweights like Reliance Industries, State Bank, Tata Motors, Tata Steel, Infosys, HPCL, HLL, Bhel, ITC, ICICI Bank, Hindalco and GACL suffered substantial losses. IT stocks fell after overnight Nasdaq losses.

 Among the gainers were Cipla, Ranbaxy, Dr Reddys, Satyam Computers, ONGC, Grasim, HDFC and Bajaj Auto.

 The volume of business was relatively high.

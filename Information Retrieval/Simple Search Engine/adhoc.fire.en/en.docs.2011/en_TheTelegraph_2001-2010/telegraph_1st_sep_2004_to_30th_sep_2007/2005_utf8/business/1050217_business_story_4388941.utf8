 Maran tech hard-talk heats up spectrum squabble

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Maran: Plainspeak

 New Delhi, Feb. 16: Dayanidhi Maran says India will not take sides in the war between mobile phone technologies ? GSM versus CDMA. 

 But a rider that he added while addressing a conference at Cannes in France ? ?India will not accept discarded technologies? ? is stirring up a wave of controversy in the wireless world.

 ?We in India, do not commit ourselves to any single technology. Our policy is technology neutral. But it does not mean that we embrace inefficient or discarded technologies, quot; the Union communications minister said while addressing the third global system for mobile communications (GSM) World Congress today.

 GSM and CDMA (code division multiple access) are the two main mobile phone technologies used by the service providers across the world. AirTel, Hutch and Idea Cellular use GSM, while Reliance and Tata Teleservices use CDMA.

 It is the loaded comment on inefficient and discarded technologies that has now kicked up a storm in the industry.

 Since it was a GSM summit, the cellular service providers wanted to believe that Maran was referring to PCS 1900. 

 PCS 1900 is a new band of airwaves for the operators that carry the voice, multimedia and high speed data, popularly known as 3G applications. Operators like Reliance and Tata have proposed that they should be given spectrum allocation in new band of spectrum PCS 1900. 

 The GSM players like Bharti, Hutch, Idea and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd have opposed the idea, claiming that it will not only lead to disturbance in voice quality of their (GSM) service due to interference but also block their migration to 3G services.

 The Telecom Regulatory authority of India (Trai) had indicated in its consultation paper that usage of the North American PCS band (PCS 1900) spectrum either in part or in whole, may be considered as a quot;possible alternative solution quot;. 

 Maran said, quot;We are also committed to ensure that paucity of spectrum does not throttle the growth of the telecom industry. 

 ?We therefore foresee, participative growth of all players as well as technologies. A telecom team is already looking into issues relating to spectrum. The spectrum policy will be technology-neutral, in tune with the established policy and international practices. quot;

 Reacting to Maran?s comments, a senior Reliance Infocomm executive said, ?It is not clear as to which is an inefficient technology (GSM or CDMA). Only last week, the GSM operators themselves said in a letter to the minister that code division multiple access (CDMA) is a better technology in utilisation of spectrum.?

 Maran said India was looking forward to introduce 3G services in the country and was watching the developments and deployments of 3G networks in other countries.

 Commenting on future of telecom sector in India, Maran said, quot;We see vibrant competition, increased affordability, enhanced rollout and coverage, higher rural traffic, lower roaming charges, next generation services, as growth drivers for the future.?

 The minister also invited telecom manufacturers world over to look towards India as an attractive destination to establish their units in India in order to make it a hub not only for domestic supplies but also for servicing other countries in the region. 

 He said that though India had allowed 100 per cent FDI in the manufacturing sector, it had not led to expected growth. 

 To surpass the target of providing 250 million telephone connections over the next three years, the country has to reduce dependence on imports. 

 He assured the international community that Indias fiscal, taxation, trade policies would be in tune with the expectations of the telecom manufacturers to achieve the objectives. 

 India today ranks among the top 10 telecom networks in the world and the second largest in Asia.

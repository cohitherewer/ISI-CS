 New Delhi, Nov. 29: UB Group plans to float two initial public offerings (IPOs) of about $200 million each to fund its aviation venture and retire debt in United Spirits.

 Both the IPOs are likely to be floated in 2006.

 About $200 million will be raised by the groups airline ? Kingfisher Airlines. United Spirits will also raise another $200 million from private equity investors, group chairman Vijay Mallya said on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.

 The airlines initial fund requirement is about $200 million. We are restricting it to that level during the first phase, he said.

 On the spirit business he said the company would be raising $200 million, which would be used for reduction of debt raised for purchasing Shaw Wallace and Company, as well as for funding the merged spirits entity United Spirits.

 The IPO proceeds will be used to fund the airlines fleet expansion plans. At the recently concluded Dubai Airshow, Kingfisher Airlines had announced it would purchase 50 aircraft, including 20 ATRs and 30 Airbus A-320s. The value of the order is about $2 billion.

 Regarding Kingfisher Airliness offer to pick up a stake in Air Sahara, Mallya said they had received several queries from the advisers, Ernst and Young. The queries received were normal in case of a merger or acquisition. The advisers wanted to know what we meant and what was included, he said. 

 Refusing to divulge details of the offer made to Air Sahara, Mallya said, It is a value-for-money deal at the price I have quoted. However, whether it is the same at the price valued by Ernst and Young is debatable.

 About a possible drop in Kingfisher Airlines fares due to cut in aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices from Thursday, Mallya said, Commercial aviation is not a business where fares are raised when ATF prices rise and lowered when the price of fuel falls. ATF is a significant component, but not the only cost burden that an airline has to bear.

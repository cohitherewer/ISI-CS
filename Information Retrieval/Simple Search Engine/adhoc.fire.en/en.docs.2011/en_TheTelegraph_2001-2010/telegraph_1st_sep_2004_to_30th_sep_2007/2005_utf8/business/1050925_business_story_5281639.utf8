 BoB merges rural banks

 Mumbai, Sept. 24 (PTI): Bank of Baroda has merged its three sponsored regional rural banks in Gujarat into one single RRB ? Baroda Gujarat Gramin Bank ? to be headed by chairman D. Rajagopalan.

 The merged banks were Panchmahal Vadodara Gramin Bank, Valsad Dangs Gramin Bank and Surat Bharuch Gramin Bank.

 The Baroda Gujarat Gramin Bank came into effect from September 12 this year, a bank release said here today.

 With the bigger size and expanded coverage the amalgamated RRB will have the benefit of economies of scale.

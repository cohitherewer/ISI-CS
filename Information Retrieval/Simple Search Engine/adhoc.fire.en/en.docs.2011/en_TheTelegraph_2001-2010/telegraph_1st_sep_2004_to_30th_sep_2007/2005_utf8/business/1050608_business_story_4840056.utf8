 NIIT Tech profit jumps 77%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 7: NIIT Technologies Ltd (NTL) recorded a 77 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 58.5 crore during 2004-05 ? its first year of independent operations. The board of the company has recommended a 55 per cent dividend to its shareholders for the last fiscal.

 The company was spun off in June 2004 from NIIT Ltd, which holds 25 per cent stake in the company. 

 The company reported an earning per share (EPS) of Rs 15.15 and the board recommended an enhanced dividend of Rs 5.50 for every equity share of Rs 10 each.

 Consolidated revenues for the financial year 2004-05 stood at Rs 543.20 crore. The NIIT subsidiary has also reported a 37 per cent growth in operating profits, resulting in a 3.29 per cent improvement in operating margin to 18 per cent.

 Its information technology solutions division contributed Rs 509.30 crore to total revenues, while the business process outsourcing (BPO) business chipped in with Rs 33.90 crore.

 Being the first year of independent operation, we are pleased to see vastly improved profits and consistently improved operating margin in all the four quarters of the year, said Arvind Thakur, CEO, NIIT Technologies Ltd. He added, In this business we chose to bring sharp focus on three industry verticals, namely, financial services, transportation and retail, which together grew by 30 per cent during the year. 

 The three verticals contributed to 62 per cent of the overall business against 54 per cent in the previous year. 

 Thakur said the company would continue to pursue with its strategy to focus and differentiate.

 The company consolidates its Continental focus. While its business from Europe contributed to 43 per cent of the total, the US came next with 35 per cent, followed by Asia Pacific (12 per cent) and India (10 per cent). 

 For the four quarter of the last fiscal, the company recorded a revenue of Rs 137.10 crore and a net profit of Rs 16.90 crore. A fresh order intake of $37 million in the January-March quarter led to a healthy pending order book of $151 million. 

 The IT firm has also initiated a pilot software development project in Shanghai to gain experience for offshore execution in China. 

 NIIT Technologies will gradually be expanding the capacities in its facilities in Delhi, Gurgaon and Bangalore. Over 100,000 square feet space will be added during the year. We are investing in growth through capacity building by setting up a 20-acre campus in Greater Noida that can accommodate 10,000 professionals. It would be undertaken in three phases of 3000 each in first two phases and 4000 in the last phase. The first phase would be completed in next 18-24 months, said Rajendra S. Pawar, chairman, NIIT Technologies.

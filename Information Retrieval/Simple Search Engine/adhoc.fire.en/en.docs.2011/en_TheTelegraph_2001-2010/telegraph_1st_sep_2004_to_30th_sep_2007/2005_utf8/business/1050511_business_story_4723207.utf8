 SBI Caps ready for makeover 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 10: SBI Capital Markets (SBI Caps) has outlined a series of initiatives to emerge as a full-fledged consultancy organisation.

 Apart from providing high-end strategic advisory services, SBI Caps is betting on knowledge management. It is also considering the possibility of setting up a separate division to cater to international companies interested in doing business in India. To tap this potential, SBI Caps has established its presence in London, Dhaka and Colombo last year.

 The company has lined up these initiatives to support an enhanced retail foray in the country in the next 15 months. SBI Caps plans to set up 50 offices, even as it will slowly exit the leasing and hire purchase business.

 According to managing director and CEO Indrajit Gupta, the investment bank is also building bridges with foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who now play a significant role in the capital markets. 

 The company has announced a 40 per cent rise in net profit for the year ended March 31 at Rs 88 crore against Rs 63 crore in the previous year. Its total income grew to Rs 174 crore from Rs 138 crore, a growth of 24 per cent. Of this, the growth in revenue from fee-based income was 53 per cent.

 Gupta said with high levels of attrition in the industry, SBI Caps has introduced performance-linked variable pay structures. 

 While the company has recruited more than 100 management graduates, plans are afoot to hire more in line with its plans to expand its retail presence in India.

 ?We are strong in knowledge management and advisory services. Along with these, we are revamping other areas as well,? Gupta said while detailing the companys plan to enhance its retail distribution setup and opening up ?connection? with FIIs.

 SBI Caps, with a strong project finance team, has expanded its operations in neighbouring countries. Its project finance team has already been awarded mandates by business houses and governments in Oman, Maldives, Mauritius, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

 In project advisory services, SBI Caps is focusing on key areas that include power, transportation, telecommunications, energy and urban infrastructure. Company officials said it is working on various mandates in the current year. 

 These comprise selling a thermal power plant, restructuring a large power generation company and a refinery. The company is also working on restructuring of two state electricity boards in the country.

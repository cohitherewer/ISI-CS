 Xerox to fully own local outfit

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New target

 New Delhi, May 24: Xerox Corporation today said it will increase its shareholdings in Xerox India Ltd to 100 per cent from 86 per cent at present.

 Yes, that is our objective. We intend to increase our stake to 100 per cent. However, at the moment we have not approached the foreign investment promotion board (FIPB) for an approval, said Andrew Horne, managing director of Xerox India Limited.

 At present, the public, financial institutions and Modi Rubber together hold 14 per cent of the equity that Xerox Corp does not own. The company has refused to spell out a timeframe for the buyout.

 Xerox Corps relations with Modi Rubber turned frosty after it accused the Indian partner in 2001 of paying bribes to secure government contracts. The accusation was investigated by the Serious Frauds Office but no real action was taken. Asked if there had been any communications with Modi Rubber on the buyout, Horne said, There is no problem at all.

 Xerox India, which earned revenues worth $98 million in calendar year 2003, wants to be aggressive in the Indian market, Horne said.

 The financial results for 2004-05 are expected to come out in July or August this year.

 At present, Xerox enjoys a 37 per cent share in the copier business and 13 per cent in the digital multi-functional market. In India, companies like Canon and Hewlett-Packard are Xeroxs competitors in copier and printer segments respectively.

 Unveiling its business strategy to grow its share in the Indian document management industry, the company has introduced Xerox office services. In addition, Xerox India plans to launch 30 products this year.

 The company has identified colour, new business of printing and inkjet and laser conversion as key elements of its strategy for 2005.

 Xerox has signed partnerships with IT companies like Salora International, Ingram Micro, Godrej Prima, Redington India Limited and Accel Icim.

 Explaining that outsourcing document management can help companies cut costs, L. V. Sastry, associate director, Xerox Global Services, said, These companies can save as much as 10-30 per cent of their printing costs. The Indian market presents a huge potential for such solutions.

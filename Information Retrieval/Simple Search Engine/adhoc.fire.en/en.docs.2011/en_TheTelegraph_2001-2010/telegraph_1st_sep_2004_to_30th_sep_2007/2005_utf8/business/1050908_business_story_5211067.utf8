 Higher book profit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: Gail (India) is expected to post a higher book profit with the department of company affairs (DCA) ruling in its favour for lowering the depreciation charge for gas pipelines to of 3.17 per cent per annum against the earlier rate of 10.34 per cent. 

 According to a Gail communique, investors in the company will now get higher returns as the companys book profit will go up due to the lower depreciation charge.

 The revised rate based on the useful technical life of 30 years comes into effect on a prospective basis from April 1 this year. 

 The new rate of depreciation follows GAILs efforts to eliminate the disparity in depreciation rates for calculating the tariff on the one hand and for book accounting purposes on the other. 

 Prior to the DCA approval, the depreciation charge for calculating the tariff was fixed at 3.1 per cent while for book accounting, a 10.34 per cent charge was used. 

 As a result, the companys books of account reflected a value that was lower than the actual value based on the true life span of 30 years for the pipeline assets. 

 The parity in the depreciation rates will result not only in the lesser provision towards book depreciation but also in the true value of the pipeline assets.

 Earlier, Gail had made a representation to the DCA highlighting the fact that the true life of a pipeline asset is higher than that of normal plant and machinery and that the accounting depreciation rate for gas pipelines should be commensurate with the true life of the asset. The company had also pointed out that international practices in developed gas economies also consider the life of a pipeline to over 30 years. 

 Engineers India Ltd and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India too upheld Gails views on this.

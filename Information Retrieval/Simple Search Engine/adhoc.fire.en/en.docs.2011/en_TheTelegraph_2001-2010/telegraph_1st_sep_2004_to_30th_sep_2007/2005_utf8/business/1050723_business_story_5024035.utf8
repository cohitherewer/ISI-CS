 Reliance calls off buyback offer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 22: Nearly eight months after a share buyback plan was approved by its board, Reliance Industries (RIL) ? now under the control of Mukesh Ambani ? is calling it off.

 The company decided on the change in plans after the ownership dispute between the Ambani brothers was resolved. Moreover, there has been a huge run-up in RIL shares with the average price staying well above the proposed buyback offer of Rs 570 since early this year. The company had, therefore, stopped fresh purchases under the buyback programme in recent months. 

 RIL today informed the bourses that its board would meet on July 27 to consider the proposal for closing the buyback offer.

 At a board meeting on December 27, the petrochemicals giant had decided to go in for a buyback programme. RIL had explained that the decision was a reflection of the under-valuation of the companys share price and the confidence of its management in its future growth prospects. 

 It added that the move would jack up the RIL share price, and thereby maximise shareholders overall value. The move would also increase the earnings per share by reducing the number of shares outstanding in the market.

 The buyback programme was envisaged for a maximum amount of Rs 2,999 crore. This was equal to 10 per cent of the total paid-up equity capital and free reserves on March 31, 2004. 

 At the December board meeting, Anil Ambani, who was then the vice-chairman and managing director of Reliance Industries, had opposed the move, arguing that shareholders should instead be given a bonus. However, with all RIL directors voting for the proposal, the buyback was approved.

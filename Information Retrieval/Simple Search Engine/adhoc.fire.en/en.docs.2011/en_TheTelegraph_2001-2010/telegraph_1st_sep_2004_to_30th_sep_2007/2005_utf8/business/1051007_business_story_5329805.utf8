 Mumbai, Oct. 6: The K.P. Narasimhan Committee has recommended sweeping reforms in the insurance sector that include lower capital requirements for health and agriculture insurance entities and the abolition of a licensing system for insurance agents and surveyors.

 In a 91-page report submitted to insurance regulator Irda, the panel said Section 6 of the Insurance Act of 1956 needs to be amended to provide for different levels of capital for certain classes of businesses such as agriculture and health insurance.

 At present, the minimum capital requirement is fixed at Rs 100 crore for life and non-life insurance segments and Rs 200 crore for reinsurers.

 The panel took the first stab at proposing a relaxation in the investment norms for the insurance industry. It suggested that the insurers could be allowed to invest a part of their investible funds in other than approved investments subject to regulations determined by the Irda.

 At present, insurers are required to maintain 25 per cent in government securities, another 25 per cent in gilts and other approved investments and the rest in investment avenues that were approved by the regulator.

 The panel suggested that insurers should be allowed to invest in the equities of public companies and deal in derivatives only for hedging purposes in a manner to be specified by the regulator.

 The committee also suggested that the transfer of shareholders funds to the policyholder funds could be permitted on four counts ? to meet the new business strain; to meet the expense overruns; to meet the deficit caused by impairment of assets; and to meet the cost of new bonus.

 The committee said ultimately insurers should be allowed to set their own rates against the present system where rate-setting is done through a tariff advisory committee. This has to be done progressively. As a first step, the function may be transferred to the General Insurance Council, the committee said.

 The committee also favoured the abolition of licensing of surveyors. 

 The report said the present system of licensing of insurance agents by the Irda had served no useful purpose. Instead, it would be better to entrust this responsibility on the insurers themselves with checks and balances, and enabling the authority to regulate this aspect by way of detailed regulations.

 The committee also said no insurance agent should work for more than one life insurer and one general insurer.

 Vodafone unveils share buyback plan

 London, May 24 (Reuters): Cellphone giant Vodafone Group plc announced a ?4.5-billion ($8.23 billion) share buyback and doubled its dividend on Tuesday, but concerns about rising competition and a trimmed forecast sent its stock sinking.

 The share repurchase plan from the worlds top mobile phone group by revenue hit the upper-end of expectations. But it had been well-flagged and investor attention swung to comments about tough markets, a struggling Japanese unit and margin pressure.

 All around the world, we are seeing slightly greater competition, whether it is from operators that choose to have their networks or MVNOs (Mobile Virtual Network Operators), chief executive Arun Sarin told a conference call.

 But he said Vodafone, with 154.8 million customers in 126 markets around the world, had the scale to offset competition and noted that the company had outperformed its top German and Italian rivals in terms of profit and revenues and its top Spanish rival on a revenue basis.

 Nevertheless, Vodafone forecast that free cashflow would fall to ?6.5-7 billion in the year to March 2006 from ?7.8 billion, partly due to lower dividends from US joint venture Verizon Wireless. Margins would be flat or one percentage point lower, it said.

 Although earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose to ?13.041 billion from ?12.64 billion on revenues of ?34.13 billion ? the top end of forecasts ? its shares had tumbled 4.1 per cent to 140-1/2p.

 We wonder, post results, what catalysts there are to drive the share price higher, said Nomura telecom analyst Mark James, noting that Japan remained a tough nut to crack. 

 With the buyback confirmed, investors may return to fretting about the problem areas, he added.

 Brokers Cazenove downgraded the stock, which had risen sharply ahead of results, to in-line from outperform.

 In Japan, arch-rivals NTT DoCoMo and KDDI continue to dominate one of the worlds most sophisticated cellphone markets, and Vodafone said its third-ranked Vodafone K.K. posted a 25 per cent fall in operating profit and 2 per cent lower revenues in local currencies.

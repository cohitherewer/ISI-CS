 Ontrack to focus on overseas business

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 27: City-based Ontrack Systems is planning to expand its operations and is eyeing the merger and acquisition route to tap the overseas market.

 ?We are already in the process of finalising a deal with a UK-based company as well as a Dutch firm for BPO business in the area of technical services,? says B. Hari, managing director of Ontrack.

 The company is also exploring possibilities of international collaboration with leading IT companies in the Asean region for its flagship portal for e-tendering.

 Ontrack Systems has been a pioneer in electronic tendering and hosts 1,000 tenders annually. The total value of tenders hosted online in 2004 stood at Rs 11,503.6 crore.

 ?We also plan to introduce electronic reverse auction within the next six months,? Hari said. ?This will bring in more transparency in dealings with government firms for public department contracts.?

 According to a survey, railways topped the list with 4,438 tenders, followed by defence with 3,006 tenders and 2,054 tenders came from the power sector. Other sectors include petroleum, ports and shipping, aviation, telecom, steel and finance. 

 A survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers states that ?a 10 per cent reduction in purchase costs can deliver up to 50 per cent rise in profit margin.?

 Buffett: Trying 

 times 

 New York, March 28: Over 

 the last four decades, Warren E. Buffett has built Berkshire 

 Hathaway into one of the world?s largest and most successful 

 insurers. Along the way, he has navigated the stock market 

 with legendary prowess and offered folksy guidelines for 

 proper corporate governance.

 Now, with investigators on three 

 continents examining Berkshire affiliates and a Tuesday 

 deadline looming to respond to an Australian regulatory 

 inquiry, Buffett?s firm is in the unfamiliar position of 

 having to defend its integrity.

 Berkshire insurance affiliates 

 run by Buffett?s most trusted deputies are involved in what 

 investigators describe as possible financial manipulation 

 at insurance giants such as the American International Group 

 and the Zurich Financial Services Group. Investigators are 

 examining Berkshire transactions that they say helped lead 

 to the collapse four years ago of an insurance company involved 

 in the biggest financial scandal in Australian history.

 Investigators say they have traced 

 many suspect transactions to a Berkshire subsidiary in Dublin, 

 Ireland, where at least two Berkshire executives who were 

 recently banned from the Australian insurance market for 

 engaging in abusive practices continue to work for the company.

 Investigators are trying to determine 

 the extent of Buffetts knowledge of the deals, which 

 remains unclear. The involvement of other senior executives 

 based in the United States, Ajit Jain and Joseph P. Brandon, 

 and Ron Ferguson, a retired Berkshire insurance executive, 

 is also unclear; all three men oversaw insurance operations 

 that sold products at the core of international regulatory 

 scrutiny. None of the executives has been charged with wrongdoing.

 The broad investigation into the 

 insurance industry has already brought down top executives 

 of other insurers, including Maurice R. Greenberg, the former 

 chief executive of the American International Group. AIG 

 directors are nearing a decision to cut all ties to him. 

 Among other transactions, regulators are looking at a deal 

 Greenberg struck in late 2000 with the General Re Corp, 

 a unit of Berkshire Hathaway. While many companies are being 

 scrutinised, one person briefed on the various investigations 

 described General Re as ?at the center of the storm?.

 A Berkshire spokesman declined 

 to respond to questions about the executives, their business 

 dealings or the investigations, other than to cite a statement 

 from Berkshire?s most recent annual report: ?Operating decisions 

 for the various Berkshire businesses are made by managers 

 of the business units. Investment decisions and all other 

 capital allocation decisions are made for Berkshire and 

 its subsidiaries by Warren E. Buffett, in consultation with 

 Charles T. Munger.?

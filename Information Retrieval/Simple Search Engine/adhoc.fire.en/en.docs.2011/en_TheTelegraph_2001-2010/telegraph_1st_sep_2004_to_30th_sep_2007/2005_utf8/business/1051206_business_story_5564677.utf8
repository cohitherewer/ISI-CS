 Airport makeover drill hits another air pocket

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: The modernisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports will have to wait longer for take-off. The empowered group of ministers that was to examine the revamp bids has referred them back to the inter-ministerial panel for final recommendations within two weeks.

 Six companies were in the fray when the empowered group (EGoM) met here this evening under the chairmanship of defence minister Pranab Mukherjee to select technical bidders for modernisation of the Delhi and Mumbai airports. Sources said the EGoM could not get clarification on many issues related to the global standards set for qualification.

 The project, estimated to cost Rs 5,400 crore, was announced by the NDA government but could not take wing due to strong opposition from the Left parties, which demanded more stringent norms for the participants. 

 The discussions were inconclusive, the issue has been sent back to the inter-ministerial group (IMG). We will wait for its report, which should come in the next two weeks, Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel said.

 Last week, the IMG, headed by civil aviation secretary Ajay Prasad, examined the proposals of the inter-ministerial committee of officials on the technical evaluation carried out by Airplan. The global consultant had subsequently sent its report to the EGoM.

 The buzz in the power corridors blames the delay on a process under which the review committee had to grade bidders on technical parameters. The criteria, based on a scale of 100, ensured that only two of the six aspirants ? Reliance-ASA and GMR-Fraport ? cleared a threshold of 80. Other contenders have questioned this system.

 Sources said differences have arisen among the IMG members on the grading system following the letter sent by one of the bidders. Companies that have lost out because of the conditions are understood to be lobbying with the government to call for fresh bids. Those hurt by the system have sought a review of technical evaluation norms; others have warned against diluting the guidelines.

 Last week, Prasad was confident that the process of modernisation of the two airports would be taken to the next logical step. The expert group of ministers will now take a decision on bidders who fulfilled technical norms after IMGs report.

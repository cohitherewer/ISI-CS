 Prolonged volatility worries RBI 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 5: The Reserve Bank isnt worried about fluctuations or corrections in the financial markets, but is deeply concerned about market volatility over extended periods, said RBI deputy governor Rakesh Mohan.

 Without specifically referring to the recent gyrations on the stock markets, Mohan said, A certain degree of fluctuation is necessary, even good for the system; it ensures financial stability. 

 But when the financial markets turn volatile, central banks need to act ? and act quickly and unequivocally to bring about financial stability.

 Picking financial stability as the central theme for the luncheon address to the global banking summit that began here today, the RBI deputy governor said, It would be difficult to find a consensus on what financial stability really means. Half in jest, he added: The only consensus is that it means lack of financial instability.

 He said the central bank wasnt worried about the automatic correction in the markets. Markets cannot function without fluctuations, he added. 

 Mohan said in their quest for financial stability ? a kind of holy grail that all central bankers seek, the banking regulatory authorities need to create a robust system that facilitates efficient allocation of resources. 

 The system should also be able to withstand exogenous shocks like the recent blowout in global crude oil prices and should provide safeguards against a sharp rise and fall in asset prices. But while adopting measures to build the cushions against financial instability, the central bank must ensure that it doesnt overdo things and arrest the growth of the economy.

 Mohan said financial stability had been built into the mandate of several central banks including the Bank of England even though the powers of regulation and supervision didnt vest with it any more. 

 He gave two instances where the Reserve Bank had acted swiftly to quell scares in the market over the past year. The first time was on May 17 last year when the stock market tanked by over 500 points just after the general elections raised the prospect of Congress-led UPA government. The second was when a rumour in one part of the country almost sparked a run on a private bank.

 On both the occasions, the central bank had stepped in to deal with the situation firmly. In the first case, the bank had said that it would meet all the demands for dollars (there was a fear that the foreign investors would press for repatriation of their investments); in the second instance, it guaranteed payment to customers of the private bank.

 The intervention had a salutary effect, Mohan said. Not one dollar of investment went out of this country.

 In the second case, the panic among customers of the private bank also died down.

 Mohan said financial instability was a phenomenon that central banks around the world had been wrestling with for close to a hundred years.

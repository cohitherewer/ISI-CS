 Billion-dollar NRI edifice

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 29: A gaggle of resourceful NRIs, a deep-pocketed moneybag and a dream spun around housing ? what you have is the building blocks of a super township.

 At the head of the plan is Royal Indian Raj International, a Nevada-based firm promoted by NRIs who plan to build integrated townships and cities in India. To make sure the project does not look like castles in the air, the enterprising band has taken on board The Greenwich Group International, a bulge-bracket real estate investment banker based in New York.

 On the table is an investment commitment of $1 billion (Rs 4400 crore), in the form of foreign direct investment, for building swank townships across the country. 

 ?These are not enclaves for the super rich, but townships for all aspects of society,? says Manoj Benjamin, chairman and managing director of Royal Indian Raj. The townships will have modern amenities ? a plexus of well-laid roads and fast-clearing sewage-disposal systems ?that match those in the developed world. If the Rs 4,400-crore blueprint gets off the drawing board and to the ground, what we will have is the largest single piece of FDI in the newly-liberalised real estate sector.

 Royal Indian Raj has clearances to acquire 5,000 acres near Mumbai, 3,000 acres near Delhi, 5,600 acres near Bangalore and 5,000 acres near Calcutta, Benjamin said. The first will be a 17-acre residential complex on the fringes of the Garden City.

 The towering ambition has financier Greenwich excited. ?We are part of this burgeoning capital flow since it relates to Royal Raj?s projects in India,? said Simon Milde, chairman and CEO. He has reason to be. India?s real estate market, worth a staggering Rs 2,20,000 crore, is expanding at 25 per cent.

 Benjamin has a riposte when asked how soon the complexes would come up. ?Tata Steel took years to take shape as Jamsetji Tata had trouble raising finance. Reliance?s petrochemicals plant was not built overnight.? The intrepid NRI couldn?t be thinking any bigger.

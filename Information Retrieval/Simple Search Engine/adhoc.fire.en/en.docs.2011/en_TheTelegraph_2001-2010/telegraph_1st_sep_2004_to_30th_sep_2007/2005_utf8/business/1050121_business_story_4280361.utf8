 Gujarat Ambuja to be biggest gainer

 VIVEK NAIR 

 Mumbai, Jan. 20: Gujarat Ambuja Cements (GACL) will bag the kings share of goodies from the deal between Holcim and Ambuja Cement India.

 GACLs fortunes will soar with the rising valuations of Ambuja Cement India (ACIL), in which GACL will now hold 33 per cent. 

 Analysts tracking the cement industry say the valuation of Gujarat Ambujas Rs 400-crore initial investment in ACIL has leaped to Rs 1,700 crore in the new scenario. 

 quot;Initially, Ambuja Cement India was an obscure company. Its valuations have now soared. With GACL holding a 33 per cent stake in ACIL, this will now be built into the company, quot; says Karthik Eswar, cement analyst at Khandwala Securities.

 Analysts feel the steep valuations will be reflected in higher other income, which will boost GACLs topline. 

 However, there is no significant appreciation for Associated Cement Companies (ACC) as Holcim is making an open offer through ACIL at the same price as was paid by the Ambuja group when it bought the company in 1999, they added.

 Analysts feel there is only a marginal appreciation if one is to look at ACC alone. quot;On a per tonne basis, it works out to over $126 per tonne, whereas the earlier acquisition was in the range of $122 per tonne, quot; sources said.

 In 1999, the Ambuja group had stunned corporate circles when it bought out the Tatas in ACC in tranches for Rs 370 per share. It had initially acquired around 7.2 per cent for Rs 455 crore.

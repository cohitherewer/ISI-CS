 Vedanta hits rough patch

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY 

 Bhubaneswar, May 12: The proposed 1-million-tonne alumina refinery project by Vedanta Alumina suffered a setback today after a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court rejected a petition to quash the hearing of the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) regarding the companys alleged violation of forest laws.

 Vedanta has argued that the CEC hearing was delaying the refinery project in the Lanjigarh area of the tribal-dominated Kalahandi district. The CEC is currently hearing the allegations of forest and environment law violations by the company in Lanjigarh. 

 However, arguing for the CEC, senior advocate Harish Salve said bauxite mining in the Niyamgiri hills would affect its biodiversity.

 The mining area for the project will be spread over 680 hectares of Niyomgiri forests in Kalahandi district. Vedanta Alumina has entered into an agreement with Orissa Mining Corporation to form a joint venture to explore the Niyamgiri mines allotted to it. 

 While rejecting the petition by Vedanta, the three-judge bench headed by Arijit Pasayat directed the CEC to complete the hearing in four weeks and submit the report to the court in eight weeks. 

 The controversy over Vedanta Aluminas refinery project in Orissa has deepened after the company last month told the CEC that its mining project at the Niyamgiri hiils was integral to the alumina refinery project at Lanjigarh. Earlier, the company had stated that its proposed refinery at Lanjigarh was not connected to mining in the Niyamgiri hills. The company has also filed an affidavit that that it does not need the 58.93-hectare forest land that it had initially submitted for the project. 

 The acquisition of forest land has fuelled much controversy with the CEC seeking clarifications of the ministry of environment and forest on certain violation of forest conservation norms.

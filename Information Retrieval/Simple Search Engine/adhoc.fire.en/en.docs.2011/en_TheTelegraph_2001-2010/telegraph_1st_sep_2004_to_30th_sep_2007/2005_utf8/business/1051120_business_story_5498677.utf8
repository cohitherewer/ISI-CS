 BoB eyes full control of housing finance arm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 19: Bank of Baroda (BoB) is in the final stages of negotiations with the National Housing Bank, its partner in BoB Housing, to take over NHBs holding in the housing finance company.

 The bank, which proposes to merge BoB Housing with itself, has recently worked out the valuation of the company. NHB currently holds about 33 per cent in the company, which has a portfolio of about Rs 500 crore.

 The merger has been planned to increase our efficiency, he added.

 The initiative with regard to BoB Housing is part of the banks plan to restructure and strengthen its subsidiaries. 

 Already it has capitalised on BoB Cards, the credit card venture. Efforts are on to rejuvenate BoBs asset management arm, which has a limited asset base spread over a handful of schemes.

 Recently, the bank had infused Rs 80 crore into its credit-card venture, Khandelwal said and added that more positive news is expected. BoB Cards was one of the pioneers in the country.

 The BoB chief feels dynamic steps are required to bolster the banks mutual fund business. We will have to take a call on the matter, he said. However, as of now no concrete restructuring proposal is under consideration.

 The fund recently floated Baroda Global, an open-ended equity scheme.

 Bank of Baroda can raise capital of up to Rs 2,200 crore. It has recently raised Rs 750 crore by way of a Tier-II issue.

 The bank, which has a business of about Rs 1,35,000 crore, recorded about 15 per cent growth in credit during the first half.

 A follow-up equity issue has been lined up. Post-issue, the governments holding in BoB will come down to 53 per cent from 66 per cent. Its capital adequacy ratio now stands at 12.87 per cent.

 EU monopoly busters raid Intel hubsUnder pressure

 Brussels, July 12 (Reuters): US computer chip maker Intel Corp, computer makers and distributors were raided by European Commission and local authorities on Tuesday as part of an investigation into possible antitrust violations, a spokesman for the European Union executive said. 

 The commissions escalation came as Intels smaller rival, Advanced Micro Devices, was trying to ratchet up pressure on the chip maker, which has 90 per cent of world sales of microprocessors for personal computers that run Microsoft Windows and Linux. 

 (EU) competition officials, accompanied by officials from national competition authorities, are conducting inspections of several premises of Intel in Europe as well as a number of IT firms manufacturing or selling computers, commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said. 

 The investigations are being carried out within the framework of an ongoing competition case, he added. 

 Intel confirmed the raids and said that it was cooperating fully with the commission. 

 As is our normal practice, we are fully cooperating with authorities from the EU. Beyond that, we cant comment on the specifics of the searches but we believe our business practices are both fair and lawful, said spokesman Chuck Malloy at the companys Santa Clara, California, headquarters. 

 Sources familiar with the situation said that the raids included Intels installations in Swindon, England, and in Munich. 

 Japan has also acted against Intel, but US authorities have expressed little interest in becoming involved. Antitrust authorities in the United States have said that abuse of dominance or monopolisation cases are their lowest priority, after cartels and mergers. 

 The commission had let a probe it began four years ago go dormant until AMD offered new information more than a year ago. 

AMD praises move

 A spokesman for AMDs European operations reacted positively to news of Tuesdays raids. 

 We welcome todays dawn raid concerning Intels continuing infringement of European competition rules. AMD has worked with the EU Commission for years and submitted growing evidence of Intels illegal activities, including materials from third parties, the spokesman said. 

 The raids in Europe are only one of the fronts on which Intel is facing pressure. 

 AMD has argued to competition authorities around the world, and recently filed lawsuits, alleging that Intel maintains a 90 per cent market share by income and 78 per cent market share by volume by violating antitrust laws. 

 AMD filed a triple-damages antitrust lawsuit in the United States earlier this month, alleging that Intel had used threats and kickbacks in illegally building the worlds top computer chip business. 

 AMD argues that Intel coerced 38 companies, including Dell Inc. and Sony Corp. 

 Last month, AMD filed two suits against Intel in Japan, seeking $55 million in damages from the worlds largest chip maker for alleged violations of the countrys antitrust laws.

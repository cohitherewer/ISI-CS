 Inflation at lowest point in two months

 New Delhi, June 10 (PTI): The rate of inflation declined to a two-month low of 5.20 per cent during the week ended May 28 from 5.38 per cent in the previous week despite the fact that some primary and manufactured products became costlier.

 The point-to-point wholesale price index (WPI) based inflation fell for the fifth consecutive week by 0.18 per cent from the previous weeks level due to the base year effect. It was as high as 5.61 per cent in the year-ago period. WPI stood corrected at 191 points during the first week of this fiscal against provisional level of 190.2 points.

 The Union government had revised the rate of inflation upwards to 5.70 per cent during the week ended April 2 against the provisional estimate of 5.26 percent.

 Industrial growth

 The poor performance of the mining and electricity sectors pulled down the growth in index of industrial production (IIP) to 8.8 per cent during April 2005 from 8.9 per cent in the same month last year, according to official data released today. The manufacturing sector, however, registered a healthy growth rate of 10 per cent during the month, up from 8.8 per cent in April 2004. 

 The growth in the mining sector declined to 3.1 per cent and in the electricity generation, to 3 per cent from 9.1 per cent and 10.3 per cent, respectively, in the year ago period. 

 The government has also revised the indices for March 2005 and January 2005. The revised annual growth in the three sectors in 2004-05 over the previous year (2003-04) has been 4.4 per cent, 9.0 per cent and 5.2 per cent respectively.

 Bankura, Purulia in agro-park race 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 13: The Bengal government is planning to set up an agro park either in Bankura or Purulia district.

 We have seen the presentation of Alterra, the Holland-based company, for providing the technical support. They are specialists in the field of agro-parks. We will seriously consider the proposal, said Sailen Sarkar, minister of state for food processing industries and horticulture. He was speaking at a workshop organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.

 Agro-parks are integrated complexes, which consists of food processing industries and horticulture. Alterra has sought land for such a park in the vicinity of the city.

 The state government is in the process of setting up 11 food parks. Of this, work has already started on three parks. The total investment for these projects would be Rs 1,100 crore.

 The government is also setting up five agri-export zones for potatoes, mangoes, litchis, vegetables and pineapples.

 Work has commenced on the potato agri-export zone in Howrah and Hooghly districts, vegetables in north and south 24 Parganas and pineapples in Siliguri and Jalpaiguri, Sarkar said.

 However, for the successful implementation of these projects, there is a need for 40-50 storage spaces, he said. We are talking to private investors for setting up such storage chains.

 The Centre has also decided to set up a mega food park in Bengal at an investment of Rs 100 crore. 

 The central government will set up four to five food parks across the country. It has chosen Dankuni, near Calcutta, for the park in this state.

 These parks will be developed on a public-private partnership basis. A special purpose vehicle will be set up for this. The ministry will circulate a detailed policy on the scheme soon.

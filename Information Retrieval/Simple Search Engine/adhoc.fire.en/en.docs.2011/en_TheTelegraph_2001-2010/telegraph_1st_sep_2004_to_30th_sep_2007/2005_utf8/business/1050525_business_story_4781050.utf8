 Daimler plans facility in Russia

 Moscow, May 24 (Reuters): German-American carmaker DaimlerChrysler plans to start assembling Mercedes Benz models in Russia this year, the Kremlin said.

 A Kremlin statement, issued late on Monday, quoted Daimler chief executive Juergen Schrempp as telling Russian President Vladimir Putin the cars would be assembled in St Petersburg ? Putins political stronghold ? starting this autumn.

 A company spokesman in Stuttgart confirmed DaimlerChrysler planned to assemble Mercedes-Benz cars in St Petersburg, but gave no financial details or any concrete schedule to begin.

 Japans Toyota became the first major carmaker to be lured by the new Russian auto industry rules, saying last month it would invest 15 billion yen ($139 million) in a plant near St Petersburg to initially produce 20,000 Camry sedans a year.

 Analysts have said rival carmakers such as Nissan could soon follow Toyotas example after Russia decided to eliminate its 12 per cent import duties on car components.

 Russias overall auto market grew to nearly 1.4 million vehicles last year from 1.21 million in 2003.

 US auto giant Ford Motor and Frances Renault run plants in Russia, and others are set to follow as foreign car sales soared 80 per cent in 2004 and are expected to rise 50 per cent in 2005, spurred by households rising income.

 If I had any doubts ? and I dont have them ? regarding Russias development process, they would have definitely disappeared after this meeting, Schrempp told Putin during talks in the Kremlin on Monday. 

 By the way ... economists are predicting Russia will develop successfully, he said, adding he had spoken to German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder just before meeting Putin.

 Business confidence in Russia has deteriorated in the past year, partly after Moscow blocked an attempt by Germanys Siemens to buy into a Russian engineering firm.

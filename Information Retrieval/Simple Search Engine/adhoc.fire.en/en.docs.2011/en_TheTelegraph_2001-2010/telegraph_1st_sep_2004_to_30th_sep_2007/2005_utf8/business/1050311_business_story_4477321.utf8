 Calcutta, March 10: Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) is yet to issue shares to Indian Oil Corporation even though the oil PSU has pumped in Rs 150 crore for a 9.6 per cent stake in the company.

 IOC had transferred the money on February 18. Irked by the delay the oil PSU has taken up the issue with the Bengal government.

 HPL has not even called a board meeting to discuss the share transfer.

 Swapan Bhowmik, chief executive officer of HPL, said: ?It is not an issue at all. Shares will be issued in IOC?s name as part of the corporate debt restructuring package.? 

 However, he could not specify a timeframe. Bhowmik, who was speaking on the sidelines of Plastindia conference, added that a board meeting will take place soon.

 The entry of IOC is being seen as a step forward in the downstream integration process. Having lorded over petroleum retail and crude refining for years, the Fortune 500 major has been trying hard to get a foothold in the petrochemicals business. IOC will help Haldia Petrochem in its expansion programme as well as in diversification projects.

 Bhowmik told newspersons that the initial public offer of the company was still in the reckoning and had not been abandoned. On flotations in the international market, he said, ?We are looking at a number of options.?

 The company recently gave presentations on its financial status and prospects to international credit rating agencies Moody?s and Standard amp; Poor. 

 On whether HPL would raise both equity and external commercial borrowings, he said it was up to the board to decide on that.

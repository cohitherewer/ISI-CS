 Oil firms counter FM claim

 New Delhi, March 2: Although finance minister P. Chidambaram has said the duty changes on petroleum products announced in his budget will be revenue-neutral, downstream public sector oil companies have informed the petroleum ministry that these proposals will drain them of Rs 400 crore a month.

 They said unless petrol and diesel prices are increased by around Rs 2 per litre, their profits will be eroded from existing levels.

 Union petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar will be taking the issue to the cabinet to find a way out. Until then, no increase in the prices of the two fuels is expected.

 The public sector oil companies expect to lose Rs 400 crore during March as the duty changes announced in the budget come into force with immediate effect and even the 50 paise per litre road cess on petrol and diesel is not being passed on to consumers during the month. 

 While the 50 paise cess will be eventually passed on to consumers, the oil companies are expected to continue to bear the increase in excise levies. The 5 per cent reduction in customs duty on crude oil and the waiving of excise duty on LPG and kerosene was expected to give relief to the oil companies. 

 However, the oil companies have come up with the complaint that the increase in excise duties on transport fuels will cause them to lose Rs 2.50 per litre on petrol and Rs 1.75 per litre on diesel.

 Under the new duty structure, petrol will attract 8 per cent excise duty plus Rs 5 per litre instead of the 23 per cent duty earlier. On top of this, there will be the road cess and Rs 6 per litre special additional excise duty.

 On diesel, excise duty would be 8 per cent plus Rs 1.25 per litre against an 8 per cent duty. A 50 paise road cess would be added to it.

 However, the price build-up of petrol and diesel is estimated at the import parity price of the product inclusive of customs duty, even though these products are not imported. This rakes in extra money for the oil companies at the cost of the consumer.

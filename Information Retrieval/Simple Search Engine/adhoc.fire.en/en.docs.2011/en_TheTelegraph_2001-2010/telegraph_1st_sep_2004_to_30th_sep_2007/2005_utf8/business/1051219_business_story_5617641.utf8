 Q amp;A

 Car trouble

 I bought a car in November 2004 and since the premium was due at that time, I paid it in the old owners name. But after repeated requests, I did not receive the original policy. I have not transferred the car in my name, as I did not have the original documents. Now, the car has met with an accident. Can the insurer reject my claim?

 Indranil Gupta, Calcutta

 Taking into account the facts of your case, the insurance 

 company will be well within its right in not accepting 

 the claim. Since an insurance policy is a legal contract 

 between the owner of the vehicle and the insurer, it 

 is imperative that the proposer of the policy has some 

 insurable interest in the vehicle. In your case, although 

 you are the actual owner of the vehicle, the policy 

 is in the name of the previous owner. Therefore, you 

 cannot file a claim as the on-record policyholder (previous 

 owner) no longer has any insurable interest in the vehicle.

 Looking for cover 

 I want to take a term policy with a life cover of Rs 10 lakh for 20 years. Which policy would be the most cost-effective?

 Irfan K. Khan, by e-mail

 Insurance companies offer various innovative features 

 with their policies. The rate of premium differs based 

 on your health and additional features you would like 

 to opt for. Thus, it would be best if you ask agents 

 from different companies for their premium rates after 

 giving them your personal details and choices. You can 

 choose your insurer after comparing the quotes.

 Deduction details

 I had invested in a mutual fund scheme with instructions to pay a fixed sum of money into my savings account. The fund house has deducted tax at source on the total amount last year, which was less than Rs 8,000. Is TDS applicable and, if not, how do I go about obtaining a refund?

 P. Mishra, Jamshedpur

 Tax is not deducted at source on any payments made by mutual funds. However, when a mutual fund pays any dividend on any of its debt schemes, there is a dividend distribution tax, which is deducted from the dividend amount. Also, if any withdrawal is made from an equity fund, a securities transaction tax is deducted. Get in touch with the fund house and ask for details of the deducted amount.

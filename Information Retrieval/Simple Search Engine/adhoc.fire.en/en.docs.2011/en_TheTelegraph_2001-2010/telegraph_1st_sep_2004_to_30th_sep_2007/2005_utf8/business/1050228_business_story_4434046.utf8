 Q amp;A

 Single account

 For a joint post office MIS account, what happens in the case of death of one account-holder? Will the other holder get the money or the nominee becomes entitled to the amount? 

 Kajal Biswas, Wuerzburg, Germany 

 case one account-holder of a joint MIS account dies, it becomes a single account and the other holder becomes its sole owner. Post office officials say that in such an event, if the total amount deposited in the account is Rs 6 lakh, which is the investment limit for a joint account, the second holder has to withdraw the remaining Rs 3 lakh, since that is the limit for a single account. The nominee does not get any benefit till any one of the joint holders survives.

 Rent relief

 What is the maximum permissible limit of house rent and local conveyance for which one can avail income tax deduction from taxable salary in the computation of income tax?

 M. Deb Roy, by e-mail

 You can claim deduction for house rent and conveyance only if you receive such allowances from your employer. In case of house rent allowance, the deduction is based on location of the house. If it is in one of the metro cities, the actual amount is least of the actual allowance received, rent paid less 10 per cent of salary and 50 per cent of salary. For any other city, the last option is taken as 40 per cent of salary. Here, salary includes basic salary plus dearness allowance and commission received.

 For conveyance allowance, the total amount is taxable. However, if the expense is borne by the employee and reimbursed by the employer, then the amount is not taxable.

 Unique identity

 Is it necessary to submit application for obtaining unique identification number (UIN) by all individuals investors by March 31, irrespective of the size of investment or is it required only for investment above Rs one lakh?

 Ajoy Kumar Ghosal, Calcutta

 Sebi has extended the UIN deadline from March 31 to December 31. The number is required if the total investment by any individual exceeds Rs 1 lakh.

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: The cabinet today approved a proposal to set up India Infrastructure Financing Company (IIFCL). IIFCL will fund public-private ventures in the areas of airports, urban rapid transport systems, gas pipelines, special economic zones, international convention centres and tourism infrastructure.

 The company, positioned as a special purpose fund, will dip into its own equity and raise long-term debt from the market to fund projects. The government will extend a sovereign guarantee for repayment of its borrowings, capped at Rs 10,000 crore.

 Infrastructure project companies will be able to borrow from IIFCL over a maturity period of 10 years. The company will also offer refinance to banks and financial institutions for loans of five years or more.

 IIFCL would finance commercially viable projects sponsored by private or public entities and public-private partnerships.

 IIFCL will fund a project only if it is approved by an empowered committee comprising the economic affairs secretary, secretary to the Planning Commission), the expenditure secretary and secretary of the ministry dealing with the project. 

 Loans from the company will not exceed 20 per cent of the project cost and it will not take up appraisal of infrastructure projects on its own. 

 The appraisal would be done by the lead bank of the inter-institutional group (lenders consortium) financing the project. A lead bank will be one that has contributed at least 25 per cent to the total debt of a project. All disbursements and recoveries would be taken up through the lead bank. 

 Private sector companies that implement infrastructure projects, except as a competitively bid public-private partnership project, will not be eligible for direct lending and only the refinancing option will be offered in such cases.

 Sources said the corporation, which would work like a special purpose vehicle, would be operationalised by end-December so that at least some loans can be released in the last quarter of this fiscal. 

 Airport modernisation and rapid transport projects in cities like Delhi and Bangalore are expected to be among public-private partnerships to be funded by IIFCL.

 OVL bags Egypt oil block 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 1: ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) has bagged an offshore oil exploration in Egypt in partnership with IPR Energy Red Sea Inc ? a subsidiary of Texas IPR. OVL has a 70 per cent participating interest in the block.

 OVL chairman Subir Raha said, ?The high-potential North Ramadan block number 6 was won against fierce competition and was the most hotly contested block in the first round.? The consortium is reported to have pipped global majors like British Petroleum and Ludin to the post. 

 OVL sees great oil bearing potential in the block as it is situated next to the giant July oilfield, which has been in production since 1991. The Ramadan block covers an area of 290 sq km in the central part of the Gulf of Suez.

 The first phase of exploration will entail an investment of $20 million in which 3D seismic surveys will be carried out and the drilling of three exploratory wells will be undertaken. The exploration will be undertaken jointly with IPR, which is also partnering OVL in the exploration block 24 in Syria. 

 According to the current assessment, the block has potential reserves of more than 600 million barrels of oil. However, the exact picture will become clear only after the exploration wells are drilled. 

 Raha said the block has paved the way for the entry of the Indian firm into the hydrocarbon sector of Egypt.

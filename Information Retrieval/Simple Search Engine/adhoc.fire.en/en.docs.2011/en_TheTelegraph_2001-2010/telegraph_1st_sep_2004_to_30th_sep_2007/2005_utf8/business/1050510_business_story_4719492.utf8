 Air Sahara to fly to Chicago with US ally

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dutta: High-flying

 New Delhi, May 9: Air Sahara today announced a non-stop Chicago-Delhi flight in collaboration with an unamed US carrier, starting this September-October. 

 Air Sahara chief executive Rono Dutta told reporters here today that the airline was in talks with a US carrier for a joint service. He indicated this could see Air Sahara operating on certain days of the week on the Chicago route and the US airline, which he refused to name, on others. 

 Dutta said Sahara will also be launching a London service around the same time and that negotiations to lease an aircraft for these operations are under way.

 He also announced the launch of services to Singapore and Kuala Lumpur from May 11 and June 15, respectively, claiming the airline was offering ?real good service, low fares and a good flight schedule?.

 While the lowest introductory return fare of Rs 10,000 to Singapore had already been booked, the same fare for Kuala Lumpur and the higher return fare of Rs 13,000 to the island nation was still available, he said.

 Dutta said the airline was also working on inter-line agreement with at least six foreign carriers, including Air New Zealand, Garuda, Thai, Valueair and Philippine airlines, for through check-in and coordinated schedules for onward journey.

 Air Sahara, which has been hit by pilot poaching by new rivals Kingfisher and Spicejet, has decided to start hiring expat pilots till its shortage of professionals is resolved, Dutta added. 

 An attempt to work out a no-poaching pact by aviation minister Praful Patel worked partially with all airlines agreeing on a four-month notice period but not immediately acceding on other issues such as a decision on training pilots so that all airlines could depend on at least an 80 per cent home grown crew. 

 An agreement that pilots could not leave without refunding cost of training, if they left before a contract period, has also not been reached so far. Sources in the civil aviation ministry said these issues were likely to be hammered together at a later meeting.

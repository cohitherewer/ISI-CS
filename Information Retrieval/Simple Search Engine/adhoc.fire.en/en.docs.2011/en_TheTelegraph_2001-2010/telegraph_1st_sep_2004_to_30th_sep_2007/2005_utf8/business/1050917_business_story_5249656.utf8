 Citigroup steps up local R amp;D

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 16: Citigroup plans to expand its research and equity teams in India.

 The plan includes hiring people in the equity capital markets and IPO distribution businesses to deliver cross-border and domestic deals. 

 Sanjay Nayar, Citigroup country officer for India and area head of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, said, India is a local economy and a big opportunity market. With the expansion of teams across equities, research, banking and retail IPO distribution, we are geared up to deliver local IPOs to our clients, which completes our suite of capital market solutions.

 Citigroup Investment Research has hired 12 new analysts and associates in Mumbai, who will report to the head of India research, Ratnesh Kumar. 

 The expanded team will also double the number of stocks it covers, from 70 to 145, which represents 98 per cent of the MSCIs coverage of Indian scrips. Adrian Faure, head of Asia-Pacific Equity Research, said the expansion had made the team one of the most comprehensive research franchises in the country.

 The India Equities division has added nine persons in sales, sales trading and dealing, doubling the staff strength in this area.

 These hires are in addition to the India-dedicated sales people based in Hong Kong, Singapore, London and New York. The India equities team is headed by Brian Brown.

 David Ratliff, head of Asia Pacific Equities, said the business had hired some very experienced people from the market as well as promoted people internally. The increase in equity staff is in line with the ramp up in research coverage, he said.

 IOC sees profit hope in rate rise

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 2: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) hopes to return to black in the second quarter if the government raises retail oil prices next week.

 IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria said the company has sought about Rs 7 a litre increase in petrol and Rs 5 a litre in diesel to offset the under recovery.

 The cabinet is expected to take up the issue next week and we are hopeful that retail prices will be raised, Behuria said on the sidelines of IBPs annual general meeting. 

 The company is banking on financial management to post a comeback from the Rs 54-crore loss in the first quarter of 2005-06.

 We will get dividends from subsidiaries. Upstream companies will also share some of the burden. To top it all, there will be a price hike. All put together, we can make some profit, Behuria added.

 He said the government might consider a stabilisation fund to overcome the problem of under recovery due to non-revision of retail prices.

 IOC is losing Rs 60 crore a day now with crude touching an all-time high of $68 a barrel.

 It pitched for equitable distribution of under recovery by all stakeholders, including oil marketing companies, upstream companies, the government and the public.

 He claimed that IOC could maintain its investment plan ? Rs 7,000-8,000 crore each year for the next three years ?if the situation was not as grim as it was today.

 As of now, we are going ahead with our investment plan in petrochemicals, pipeline, upstream and marketing operations, he added.

 IOC will liquidate its holdings in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) in tranches to generate cash, Behuria said. It has been agreed in principle and the matter will be going to the union cabinet, Behuria said.

 IOC has a 9.2 per cent stake in ONGC.

 Behuria, however, said that IOC would not liquidate its holdings in ONGC at one go. It will be sold in tranches. We will sell it to the extent we need the cash. I am interested in maximum price, he said.

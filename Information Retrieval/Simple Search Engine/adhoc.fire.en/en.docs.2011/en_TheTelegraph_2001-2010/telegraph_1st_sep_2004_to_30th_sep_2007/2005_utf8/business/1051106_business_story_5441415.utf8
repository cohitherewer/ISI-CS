 Shareholders favour J amp;J-Guidant deal

 Philadelphia/Chicago, Nov. 5 (Reuters): Johnson amp; Johnson and Guidant Corp. should reach a compromise in a battle over the price of their $25.4 billion merger agreement rather than walk away from the deal, shareholders and analysts said on Friday.

 J amp;J wants to slash the price of its $76 per share pact to buy medical-device maker Guidant by as much as 18 per cent, but its lower offers have been rebuffed, sources familiar with the situation said.

 While J amp;J wants to pay in the low-$60s per share, Guidant is holding out for a price in the high-$60s per share, sources familiar with the situation said.

 The companies have declined to comment.

 Following recalls of some heart devices and related federal investigations, J amp;J contends that Guidants long-term growth prospects and financial health have been damaged. As a result of this quot;material adverse change, quot; J amp;J, a drug and consumer-products manufacturer, said it is not required to complete the acquisition.

 J amp;J had agreed to buy Guidant in December 2004, in a move to expand its heart-device business and offset shrinking pharmaceutical sales that have been hurt by competition from cheaper, generic drugs.

 Its just hard for me to believe (J amp;J) will just say Forget it, because I think they really want the business, quot; said Sherwood Small, a fund manager with Boston Private Value fund, which holds stock in major pharmaceutical company J amp;J.

 Guidant, meanwhile, said the problems were temporary and its suitor was legally obligated to complete the deal.

 quot;Everyone knows (Guidant) is not worth $76 per share anymore, but if the offer is in the high $60s and J amp;J says $62, you guess where theyll meet. Theres an old saying in the M amp;A business ? a dollar for peace, quot; said Small.

 Still, accepting any cut in price would put Guidants management team in a difficult bind, said Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Mark Landy.

 If (Guidants) stance is that the recall hasnt hurt their market share or the company long-term, why not stand alone and prove it? quot; Landy said.

 quot;If they do negotiate a lower price, they may open themselves up to litigation by essentially conceding that there has been a problem under managements watch, quot; Landy said.

 Lazard Capital Markets upgraded shares of Guidant to quot;buy quot; from quot;hold, quot; saying it believes the odds are still in favour of the deal being completed. The brokerage firm reiterated its $68 price target on Guidant.

 quot;They both have some to gain, but a lot to lose by walking away, quot; said one Guidant shareholder who declined to be named.

 Gail plans to take CNG to Agartala

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 5: Agartala is going to get compressed natural gas (CNG) soon. 

 Gail (India) Ltd has firmed up a plan to initially set up at least two CNG stations in the city. They will be operational in eight months from now.

 To implement the plan, Gail has set up Tripura Natural Gas Company (TNGCL), in which it has a 29 per cent stake. Tripura and the Assam government hold a 10 per cent stake each in the company.

 TNGCL chairman U.D. Choubey has met various ministers of the Tripura government and apprised them of the companys plan for the city and the state.

 We have been offered two places within the city to set up CNG stations, Choubey said in Calcutta on Saturday.

 The cost of CNG would be one-third of petrol and half of diesel. However, substantial investment has to be made by the vehicle owners to convert from natural fuel to CNG.

 The cost of conversion will be Rs 22,000 for an auto, while for a car its about Rs 40,000. In case of trucks and buses, the conversion cost is about Rs 3-4 lakh.

 Generally the government provides some incentive for conversion to CNG in the form of interest free loan, exemption from sales tax etc. The Tripura government has assured all possible support to the company, Choubey said.

 We are going to make a detailed presentation before the chief minister soon, he added.

 Going forward, TNGCL will add a few more stations in the city as well as other important locations of the state.

 The investment for each station will be Rs 3-4 crore.

 At present, TNGCL is supplying domestic piped natural gas connections to about 5,500 households in Agartala. It is also supplying to 100 commercial installations.

 Choubey, who is director of marketing in GAIL, said the Delhi and Mumbai models would be followed in Agartala.

 Calcutta network

 Gail will team up with Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) to set up the CNG network in Calcutta. The company has written to IOC already. Both IOC and GAIL will hold a 22.5 per cent stake each in the yet-to-be-named company.

 Whiff of hope for LPG applicants

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 30: The oil marketing companies ? Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum ? have been asked to issue new domestic LPG connections from tomorrow, petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said in Parliament today.

 The minister clarified that the decision to stop issuing new connections for domestic cooking gas had been taken by the oil companies on their own and the government had not issued any directions in this regard. 

 In September, the oil firms decided to stop issuing new connections as there was a shortage of LPG in the country, Aiyar said. The step was taken to enable them to meet the needs of existing consumers.

 He said during the last 18 months since he had taken over as petroleum minister, around 1.67 crore connections had been issued, while the erstwhile NDA government had issued 1.68 crore connections in three years from April 2001 to October 2004.

 The performance of oil companies was even more creditable as large number of connections had been issued despite the crisis situation resulting from an unprecedented rise in international prices of crude and petroleum products, he added. 

 The parliamentary consultative committee attached to the petroleum ministry had recommended last week that oil companies should be asked to resume issuing new gas connections to households from next month as the LPG supply position has improved.

 The committee made the recommendation after the petroleum minister informed it that the shortage of LPG had now been reduced to a mere 1 per cent and would improve further in the next few days.

 Aiyar urged the MPs to take up with state governments the issue of diversion of LPG for use as a vehicle fuel.

 Leyland to sell 3% in IndusInd

 Chennai, July 26 (PTI): Ashok Leyland Ltd will sell another 3 per cent stake in IndusInd Bank in the secondary market before October to comply with the Reserve Banks guidelines. Last year, it had offloaded a 3 per cent stake in the bank.

 The RBI stipulates that companies cannot hold more than a 10 per cent stake in private banks, Ashok Leyland managing director R. Seshasayee said today.

 Speaking at the AGM here, he said Ashok Leylands stake in the bank had gone up to 16 per cent after the merger of Ashok Leyland Finance Ltd with IndusInd Bank last year.

 Ashok Leyland is also participating in the rights issue of Ennore Foundries to maintain its stake at 21 per cent. It would invest Rs 12 crore for the rights issue, which was priced at a premium of Rs 50 per share on a face value of Rs 10, he said.

 The company is planning to launch over 20 models, including an inter-city luxury coach this year.

 Meanwhile, Ashok Leyland has posted a 101.5 per cent rise in bottomline to Rs 64.35 crore for the quarter ended June 30 from Rs 31.93 crore a year ago. 

 Sales rose 29.5 per cent at Rs 1,063.23 crore compared with Rs 821.19 crore in the first quarter of 2004-05.

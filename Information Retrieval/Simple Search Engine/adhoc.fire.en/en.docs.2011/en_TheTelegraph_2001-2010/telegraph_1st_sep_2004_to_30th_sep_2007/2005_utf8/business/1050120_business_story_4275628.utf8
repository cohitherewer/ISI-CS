 REL needs more time at Dadri

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 19: Reliance Energy today said its mega power project in Uttar Pradesh will take two years more than the original commissioning schedule of 2006-07.

 The first phase of the venture at Dhirubhai Ambani Energy City in Dadri was supposed to go on stream by 2006-07. This was based on the commitment that Reliance Industries would supply gas from the Krishna-Godavari Basin. In June last year, Reliance Energy signed an agreement under which Uttar Pradesh promised to buy 40 per cent of the power generated at the project.

 In a carefully-orchestrated move, the board of Reliance Energy has put the entire onus of coming up with a competitive and timely offer for supply of gas on Reliance Industries ? which is also its promoter. REL wrote to exchanges soon after the board meeting today that Reliance Energy Generation, the company implementing the Dadri project, has floated a global supply tender in which Reliance Industries will participate.

 The Anil Ambani-headed company had announced the project with much fanfare last year, but Reliance Industries, led by elder brother Mukesh, claimed over the past few months it was kept ?totally in the dark on it?. REL refuted this on December 7, saying all board members of RIL attended the meeting that cleared the plan.

 At its December 27 board meeting, Reliance Industries declared ?reasonable assistance? to REL in several respects, without affecting ?its own operations and projects?. The Mukesh-run company also went on to declare that it would be ?prudent for large projects of all group companies to be considered by it for approval.? 

 That followed a Mukesh interview in Petrowatch, where he was quoted as saying that gas would be made available only in 2008 ? two years later than envisaged. Today, REL acknowledged it by pushing behind the date.

Options open

 The tug-of-war over Anil?s cherished venture does not end at the delay. The REL board has clearly indicated that it will keep its ?options open?. This is being interpreted to mean that the project could be completed before 2008-09 if the company ties up gas elsewhere.

 ?Multiple global producers of gas are keen to supply gas to the Dadri project. In the event that gas availability can be secured from sources other than RIL, the start-up date could be potentially accelerated for implementation,? REL said in its letter to stock exchanges. The move is being seen as a tactic to pressure Reliance Industries to speed up the supply of gas. 

 Analysts tracking the power sector, however, say the delay was on expected lines given that the project was heavily dependent on the gas that RIL had committed. 

 Reliance Energy, on its part, seemed to realise this as it bid for smaller coal based projects in Uttar Pradesh ? a state where it is also keen on several distribution circles.

 Telecom trinity faces Trai flak

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 24: The Hutchison and BPL groups and Shyam Telelink Ltd have been pulled up by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) for not submitting their accounts based on a new reporting system to it before the deadline.

 The reporting system on accounting separation regulation, 2004 (Regulation) was issued by Trai to identify cross-subsidisation practices, investigate cases of predatory pricing and other anti-competitive practices and have the relevant data for determining cost-based charges.

 The regulation stipulated service providers, whose accounting year ended on March 31, 2004, to submit their audited accounting separation reports to Trai by December 31, 2004. 

 A senior Trai official said, ?The new revised accounting separation reports provide more accurate and detailed information on costs of various products and services. We are examining these reports in detail for any shortcomings or need for improvement in the submission. The other operators, who are yet to submit their reports, will not get any extension.?

 The service providers, who have failed to submit the reports as yet, have violated the regulation and may face prosecution.

 The defaulting companies have been served show cause notices to explain on or before Friday as to why action under the Trai Act be not taken by the authority against them for the violation of the regulation. The Trai Act allows the regulator to move courts to prosecute the violators.

 All vertically integrated players, including Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, Bharti, Reliance and Tata, have submitted audited accounting separation statements to the authority. 

 These reports include segregated cost records for various products and services provided by these companies.

 Most other stand-alone operators have also started accounting separation for products provided by them and submitted the audited accounting separation reports to the telecom regulator.

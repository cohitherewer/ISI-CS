 Private phone firms beat PSUs in race for users

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 12: It?s a private party after all. Private telecom operators have edged out Bharat Sanchar Nigam and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam ? the two public sector telecom firms ? in the race to add more subscribers and increase market share.

 According to data submitted to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), till July 2005, the private operators? subscriber base stood at 53.76 million (fixed as well as mobile), while that of BSNL and MTNL combined was 53.24 million.

 Private operators? market share has increased to 50.24 per cent compared with the two state-run firms? 49.76 per cent.

 However, the PSU companies continued to have the lion?s share of investment in this sector. As on March 31, 2004, out of a total investment of Rs 1,30,000 crore, PSU operators bagged Rs 86,000 crore, while private operators got Rs 44,000 crore.

 Both PSUs and private operators have invested well to create additional capacity in 2004-05. The figures are yet to come.

 Trai said: ?The PSUs had to invest more because they have a very large network of fixed lines, which requires greater investment than mobile networks.? 

 The subscriber base rose because the the sector was thrown open. ?The average annual subscriber growth for the period 1998 to 2005 was 11.5 million per year against earlier annual growth of 0.37 million per year during 1948-1998,? said Trai. 

 PSU operators during this period have achieved an average annual growth of about 5 million per year compared with 0.35 million per year in 1948-1998. ?PSU units did well under competition,? said Trai officials.

 T.V. Ramachandran, director-general, Cellular Operators Association of India (Coai) said: ?We are greatly encouraged by the trend. GSM additions was the highest since the inception of GSM in India (two million just in July this year). We are marching towards the target set by the government of 250 million telephones by December 2007.?

 S.C. Khanna, secretary-general of the Association of Unified Service Providers of India (AUSPI) said: ?The introduction of CDMA technology and issue of unified service access licence have helped the private operators.?

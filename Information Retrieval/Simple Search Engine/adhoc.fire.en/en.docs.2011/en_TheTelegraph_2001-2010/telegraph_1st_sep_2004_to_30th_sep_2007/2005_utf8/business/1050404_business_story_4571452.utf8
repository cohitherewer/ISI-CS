 Electrosteel on fund-raising trip

 Calcutta, April 3: Electrosteel Castings Ltd (ECL) will raise about Rs 350 crore from the equity market to fund its expansion plans.

 The company plans to start making steel by developing a long-product (LP) capacity. It will target the housing and construction sector of the eastern region.

 It is also looking at expanding the capacity for ductile iron (DI) pipes. Along with LP capacity, the total investment will be around Rs 1,000 crore.

 To finance the project, the company is considering a debt-equity mix of 2:1.

 Sources said the company is looking at three options ? a public offer, a global depository receipt (GDR) issue or a private placement to strategic investors ? to raise Rs 350 crore as equity.

 The proposals for expansion would be placed before the board along with the funding plan in the next 2-4 months, sources added.

 Initially, the company promoted by the Kejriwals, will look at a 2-lakh-tonne steel-making capacity but it may be upgraded to 5 lakh tonnes.

 ECL will also raise the capacity of DI pipes from 2 lakh tonnes to 5 lakh tonnes.

 To maintain a steady supply of raw materials like coal and iron ore over a long period, ECL plans to bid for mining leases in neighbouring states.

 It may require 1-1.5 million tonnes of iron ore and 1 million tonnes of coal annually to fire its plants for a 10-lakh-tonne production in the next three years.

 It is eyeing 30-year mining leases for both coal and iron ore in Jharkhand, Orissa and Chhattisgarh.

 After the expansion, the group turnover is expected to go up to Rs 2,500 crore from about Rs 900 crore at present.

 The decision to venture into long products is based on the good brand recall that Electrosteel enjoys in the eastern part of the country.

 A recent market survey conducted by the company revealed that while its present products (DI pipes and fittings) go to institutional customers, Electrosteel is known to common people, who buy long products for housing.

 By leveraging the goodwill, the company is confident of taking on big players like Tata Steel and Steel Authority of India (SAIL) in the east. 

 ?The process of manufacturing DI pipes and LP is the same. It is just a different product with a different application. The demand is robust and selling the extra capacity will not be a problem,? sources said.

 The company will consider setting up its own power plants for captive consumption.

 Block deals in Bharti shares

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 2: As trading began on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) today, dealers rubbed their eyes in disbelief as two huge deals in the shares of Bharti Tele-Ventures were reported within minutes of the opening ? and hours before FDI in telecom was hiked to 74 per cent.

 The transactions were worth a whopping Rs 1,201.74 crore, pushing the turnover in the company?s stock to Rs 3,914.81 crore. The first deal saw 1.6 crore shares change hands at a price of Rs 216 for Rs 345 crore; the second saw 3.93 crore of them sold at Rs 218 apiece for Rs 856.74 crore.

 As it became obvious that Warburg Pincus was the seller, eyebrows were arched as the venture capital firm has been a shareholder in Bharti for a long time. 

 Analysts say the sale was merely an attempt to make the best of the investment, whose worth is believed to have gone up four fold in the past couple of years.

 A clutch of 40 FIIs were reported to be the buyers in trades brokered by J. M. Morgan Stanley and DSP Merill Lynch.

 ?Warburg Pincus has been an anchor investor in Bharti Tele-Ventures since 1999. We partially divested our investment in Bharti, but we still hold about 12 per cent of its equity,? it said in a release put out after trading.

 ?Bharti has capitalised on the growth opportunities in the Indian telecom industry well, having rapidly consolidated its position as a leading integrated telecom services provider,? said Charles R. Kaye, co-president of Warburg Pincus. 

 The company?s shares dropped Rs 3.30 to Rs 219.05; the strike price for the two deals were a few notches below the going rate now. The stock opened at Rs 228.70, hit a high of Rs 228.70, a low of Rs 215.95 before it finished the day at Rs 219.85. 

 The move to allow more overseas cash in telecom firms boosted MTNL, whose shares jumped to Rs 139.85 from Rs 138.90, and Tata Tele-services (Maharashtra), whose stock finished at Rs 33.70 against Rs 29.75 on Tuesday.

 Viacom plans to split into two entities

 Redstone: Holding the key

 New York, March 17 (Reuters): Viacom Inc on Wednesday said it is considering splitting into two separate companies, dividing its fast-growing MTV and cable networks from CBS television and other mature units in a bid to boost its market value.

 That would likely end the race to become the next CEO in a draw, with Viacom?s two co-presidents each eventually leading a company, current CEO and chairman Sumner Redstone said, adding that he would chair both companies.

 Viacom?s widely held B-class stock rose 5 per cent to $38.80 in after-hours trade on Inet after a 6 per cent rise during regular trade on the New York Stock Exchange in anticipation of an announcement.

 Co-president Tom Freston now oversees MTV and Nickelodeon cable and the Paramount movie studio, while Leslie Moonves oversees CBS, the Infinity Broadcasting radio networks and outdoor advertising.

 Such a Viacom deal would unwind decades of acquisitions that brought together a sweeping array of cable and television broadcast programming companies, a top US television network, movie studios and movie theatres under one roof. ?The world changes,? Redstone said, adding that he had no regrets putting the company together, pointing to a steep run-up in its stock after it purchased CBS.

 Such mergers were typical during the 1980s and ?90s, but now slowly are being dismantled.

 John Malone?s Liberty Media had said it planned to spin off its interests in Discovery Networks and could be dissolving the entire company, according to analysts.

 Redstone, 81 years old, will continue to play an active role in both companies, eventually becoming the chairman of both, he said. ?I will be a very involved chairman,? Redstone added. ?It doesn?t make much difference when you control the company what title it is.?

 Redstone said he expected Freston and Moonves to eventually be the CEOs of the split-off companies, suggesting he would retain the top executive title in the short term.

 Redstone said he had been considering various options to boost Viacom?s stock. ?A separation of our businesses into distinct and strong operating entities would allow us to optimise our capital structure and create unique investments that are more appealing to investors.?

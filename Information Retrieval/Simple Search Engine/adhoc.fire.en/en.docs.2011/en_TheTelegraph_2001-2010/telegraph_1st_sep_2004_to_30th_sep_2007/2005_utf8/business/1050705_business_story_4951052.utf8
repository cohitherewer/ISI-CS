 New Delhi, July 4: The government is likely to decide by August the number of independent directors a company needs to have on its board.

 It will also take into consideration India Inc?s displeasure at a large number of such directors on the boards.

 ?Industry should decide what it wants (on the issue of independent directors). We will discuss with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and other stakeholders ... it may get resolved by August,? Union minister of company affairs Prem Chand Gupta said at a conference organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 Gupta said the government would also ready the basic framework for a new companies act.

 The minister?s statement assumes significance in the light of the differences of opinion of industry, Sebi and the JJ Irani committee on company law, which was constituted by the company affairs ministry.

 While the market regulator insists on half the company board being constituted of independent directors, the Irani committee has recommended one-third.

 Most industry chambers prefer the ratio of independent directors to be lower. For instance Ficci wants independent directors to be not more than one-fourth of a company?s board.

 Despite the sharp differences in opinion, Gupta said there was ?no confrontation? between Sebi and the ministry.

 ?I personally feel that a company should be run by its promoters and shareholders,? the minister added.

 Gupta also said, ?The quality of independent directors is important rather than their strength on the board.?

 On whether government nominees on public sector company boards are to be treated as independent directors, the minister avoided a definite reply.

 He said, ?It?s a complex issue. The matter needs to be looked into.?

 Gupta also said the government is likely to table the bill for a new companies act by the winter session of Parliament. 

 ?My efforts would be to ensure that the proposed bill does not need to be vetted by the standing committee on finance as it may take more time. I will meet the chairman of the finance committee and apprise him of the importance of the bill for the corporate sector,? he said.

 The minister will also meet Lok Sabha Speaker and deputy chairperson of the Rajya Sabha on this issue.

 Regarding the Competition Commission of India (CCI), he said legal hurdles in setting it up have been removed and the government will seek Parliament approval in the monsoon session.

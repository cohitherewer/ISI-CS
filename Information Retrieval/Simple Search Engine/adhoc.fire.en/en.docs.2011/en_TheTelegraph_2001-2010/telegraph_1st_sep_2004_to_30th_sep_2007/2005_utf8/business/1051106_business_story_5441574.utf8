 Economists list pitfalls to high growth

 New Delhi, Nov. 5 (PTI): Halfway through the 2005-06 fiscal, economists are ?cautiously optimistic? about the growth prospect of the Indian economy during the year. 

 According to various agencies, India?s GDP growth could range between 6.7 and 7.5 per cent this fiscal. While the Reserve Bank of India has pegged it at 7-7.5 per cent, International Monetary Fund forecast is 6.7-7.1 per cent. The Prime Minister?s economic advisory council puts it at 6.9 per cent, National Council for Applied Economic Research (NCAER) forecasts 7.19 per cent, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) predicts 6.8 per cent and Confederation of Indian Industry estimates at 7.3 per cent.

 Presenting a mid-year review of the economy today, economists listed risks like fiscal imbalances, high oil prices, faltering infrastructure and political risks associated with a coalition government that may hinder the growth process. They pitched for big-bang reforms and improvements in the infrastructure sector to push up GDP growth to 8-10 per cent in the Eleventh Plan period (2007-2012).

 M. Govind Rao, eminent economist and director of National Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), said, ?By all accounts, Indian economy is expected to continue its buoyant performance during 2005-06.? But he was quick to caution, ?If the oil prices continue to rule high, the chances of higher inflation and firming up of interest rates cannot be ruled out.? 

 He, however, added, ?The average annual growth rate for last three years works out to 7.5 per cent. It is, therefore, argued that achieving 8 per cent growth during the Eleventh Plan is within the realm of feasibility. But further reforms are imperative to sustain the high growth.? 

 Rao advocated fiscal, tax, agriculture and labour reforms along with speedy disinvestment and privatisation.

 Dwelling in details on fiscal reforms, he said tax reforms were necessary to reduce costs and augment revenues of the government.

 He stressed on full-fledged implementation of value-added tax and gradually moving towards a goods and services tax by integrating excise and service tax.

 ?Regional disparities in growth also need to be addressed,? he said. ?If the reforms are implemented, the economy can grow consistently at 8 per cent, even 10 per cent during the Eleventh Plan,? Rao added.

 Other experts too, pitched for big-bang reforms and improvement in infrastructure to push up GDP growth to 8-10 per cent in the next Plan period.

 Kanaiya Singh of NCAER said yawing gap between rural and urban infrastructure is holding back economic growth.

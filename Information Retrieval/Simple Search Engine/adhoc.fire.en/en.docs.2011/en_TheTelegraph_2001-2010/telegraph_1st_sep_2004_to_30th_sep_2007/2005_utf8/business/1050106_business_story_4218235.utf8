 Big Two stutter

 Detroit, Jan. 5 (Reuters) - General Motors and Ford Motor on Tuesday capped 2004 with another month of weaker sales, but a stronger performance by top foreign automakers pushed results to their highest levels since the record month of October 2001. 

 Despite a crop of new vehicles and hefty incentives, GM and Ford ended 2004 with market share losses of about one percentage point, while Chrysler and Japans Toyota and Nissan continued to post gains. 

 ?The strength of sales in the month of December was the surprise of the month, quot; said Joseph Barker, manager of North American sales analysis with CSM Worldwide. ?High inventories, high incentives and an added push to end the month on a strong note, all those things combined, quot; to boost sales, he said. 

 Total sales across the industry rose 3.7 per cent in December to 1.54 million vehicles, for a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 18.4 million vehicles. 

 That was the highest monthly rate since the industry first offered interest-free financing in an attempt to boost sales following the Sept. 11 attacks, and far above estimates of a range between 17.3 million and 17.6 million.

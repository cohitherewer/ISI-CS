 Microsoft close to EU truce

 Brussels, June 6 (Reuters): Microsoft moved a step closer to ending a long battle with the European Unions antitrust watchdog on Monday, winning praise for proposals to comply with demands for server interoperability.

 The US software giant could be hit with a fine of up to $5 million a day if the European Commission concludes that its proposals would not allow non-Microsoft work group servers to achieve full interoperability with Windows PC and servers.

 But the EU executive voiced satisfaction with Microsofts proposed solution ? even though the sticky question of open source licences was not fully resolved ? and said the plan would now be put to industry peers for their opinions.

 I am happy that Microsoft has recognised certain principles, which must underlie its implementation of the Commissions decision, European competition commissioner Neelie Kroes said.

 A commission spokesman said there were no outstanding issues on Windows Media Player, the second of two antitrust violations for which Microsoft could face fines, because proposals for compliance had already been tested in the market.

 The commission, which polices competition in the 25-nation bloc, fined Microsoft a record 497 million euros ($609.8 million) more than a year ago and demanded changes to its business practice, which it found were an abuse of a quasi-monopoly on computer software.

 Microsoft was required to make its ubiquitous Windows operating system available without Windows Media Player, so that computer makers can buy alternative software, to play films and music, from RealNetworks and Apple.

 As regards media player we market tested that earlier this year and, under the caveat that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, we do not feel at the moment we have any outstanding issues that require market testing as regards the version of Windows without media player, spokesman Jonathan Todd told a news briefing. Under the interoperability demands, Microsoft must share information with rival makers of servers used to run printers and retrieve files.

 Microsofts proposals for compliance will now be market tested with other industry players over a two-week period to enable the commission to make a final assessment. Subject to the results of this market test, work group server developers interested in receiving interoperability information from Microsoft will be able to develop and sell their products on a global basis, the commission said.

 Microsoft has also recognised the need to enhance the options available to recipients by creating a range of packages of information from which they can choose according to their needs, it said in a statement. 

 In addition to agreeing to allow the development and sale of interoperable products on a worldwide basis, Microsoft has also recognised that a category of the information, which it is obliged to disclose will be royalty-free.

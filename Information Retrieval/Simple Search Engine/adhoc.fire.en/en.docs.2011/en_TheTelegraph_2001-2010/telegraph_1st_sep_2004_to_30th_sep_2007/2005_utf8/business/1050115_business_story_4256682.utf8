 Calcutta, Jan. 14: Bengal has waived cess on green tea leaves for three years and relaxed land lease-rental payments.

 A 12 paise cess is paid on a kg of green tea leaves, 8 paise for rural employment and 4 paise for primary education. On every kilogram of processed tea ? which requires 4.5 kg of green leaves ? gardens shell out 54 paise. This is just the amount that they will be able to save.

 Addressing the 16th annual general meeting of Darjeeling Planters? Association (DPA), state commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said: ?We know that the tea industry is going through a rough patch. Keeping that in mind, we have waived the cess. The notification will be issued by the finance department soon.?

 Another booster sprinkled on the tea estates is the decision to ease lease-rental payments ? salami in industry parlance ? that have impeded the revival of ailing gardens and choked fresh investments in the industry. Firms pay Rs 9,000 per hectare on lease renewals.

 Under a new 30-year scheme crafted by the state, there will be a two-year moratorium on salami payments; it will be followed by equal instalments over 28 years.

 Sen told planters that the Centre has approved the Bengal government?s proposal to set up an agro-export zone (AEZ) in Darjeeling to give overseas tea sales a fillip. The Centre and the industry will help fund the plan.

 The revival potion for tea was not limited to the Bengal government. Even the Tea Board decided to prepare a special plan to upgrade the Darjeeling tea industry. 

 Chairman N. K. Das said Darjeeling garden-owners have been told to submit a report detailing their plantation areas, quality of tea produced and the capacities of their existing factories. ?The information they provide will be the basis of a special plan,? Das added.

 Chairman of Darjeeling Planters? Association, K. S. David, said there was a need to benchmark the quality of Darjeeling tea to retain its brand equity in the global market.

 In November last year, the government took the first tentative step towards protecting Darjeeling tea to stop unscrupulous producers in various parts of the world from passing off an inferior product as the real one. This was a preliminary move towards protecting the brand value of Darjeeling tea across the globe. 

 The GI notification came as a major relief to the tea industry, which has been suffering huge losses, largely because the world market is flooded with spurious Darjeeling tea.

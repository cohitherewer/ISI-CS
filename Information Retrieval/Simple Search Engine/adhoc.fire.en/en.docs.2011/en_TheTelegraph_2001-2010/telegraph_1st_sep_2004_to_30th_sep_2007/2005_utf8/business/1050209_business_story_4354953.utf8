 Kotak equity scheme raises Rs 577 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 8: The initial public offering of Kotak Mid-Cap, an open-ended equity growth scheme launched by Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund, has raised over Rs 577 crore, making it the second largest open-ended equity IPO collection ever.

 The corpus, which will be invested in equity and equity-related securities of mid-cap companies, closed on January 28 and received over 65,000 applications, with an average application size of Rs 88,000 from around 100 locations.

 Ajay Bagga, CEO of Kotak Mahindra Asset Management Company, said, ?The overwhelming response to the fund clearly indicates that the mid-cap story is an ongoing one. It also shows that our three-pronged strategy ? distributor extension, geographical expansion and new product initiatives ? is beginning to show results?.

 Bagga said the fund managers will invest in mid-cap companies picked through a bottom-up process, where each company will be evaluated individually and not just on the basis of the sector to which it belongs. 

 On being asked whether the IPO funds were part of the churning that takes place in the industry where money flows out of existing funds to the IPOs, Bagga said it is ?fresh money from banks and is new to the fund?. 

 Up to 95 per cent of the portfolio of Kotak Midcap can be invested in equities, with mid-cap investments ranging between 65 per cent and 95 per cent.

 The last time that the mutual fund raised this kind of funds was for Kotak Global India when it mobilised Rs 363 crore.

 According to Bagga, ?its not that his fund will invest all the money tomorrow. We have six months to invest the proceeds and we are not going to invest in a hurry.?

 Bagga said Kotak Global has outperformed market indices by a long way. Last year, when premier indices appreciated 15 per cent, Kotak Global Fund gained over 39 per cent.

 Kotak Mutual Fund has an investment corpus of Rs 6059.15 crore. The mutual fund has seen its corpus, especially in equity, growing in line with industry trends. In the recent past, it has launched four funds and plans to launch a fixed-income fund in the near future.

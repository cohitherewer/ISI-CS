 New Delhi, Nov. 28: The petroleum ministry is planning to invite foreign companies to choose their own area for exploration under the open acreage system. This would attract more investment for raising domestic oil and gas production.

 Under the new system, foreign companies will be allowed to bid for blocks of their choice rather than us identifying the blocks for exploration, petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said at the India Economic Summit 2005 jointly organised by the World Economic Forum and Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 We hope to start the open acreage system on an experimental basis in the coming years, Aiyar added.

 The government is keen to increase domestic production and bring in more investments. The minister emphasised the need to boost production as import dependence on oil and gas is expected to rise further. 

 Indias oil import has risen to 76 per cent and is expected to reach 80-85 per cent within a few years. Despite the new gas discoveries in the country, which are expected to become available by 2008, the minister said the shortfall would continue to be 50 per cent.

 Supporting the countrys focus on boosting domestic exploration, Asian Development Bank vice-president Jin Liqun said neglecting this area for many years has led to misconceptions about Indias prospects.

 He was also optimistic about Bay of Bengals oil and gas reserves.

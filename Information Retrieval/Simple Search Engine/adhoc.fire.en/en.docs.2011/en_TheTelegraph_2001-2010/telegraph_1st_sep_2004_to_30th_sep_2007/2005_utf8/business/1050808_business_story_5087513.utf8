 Easy connect

 Calcutta, Aug. 7: It is a PC that fits into your pocket and also doubles up as a cellphone.

 Ego ? the pocket PC phone from Tata Teleservices (TTSL) ? allows the user to work on Word and Excel, download mail and streaming video clips, browse the net and chat with friends.

 ?Ego has a 128 MB random access memory (RAM) and is virtually the desktop in your pocket. Users can log on to the net at a speed of 156 kbps. The product runs on Microsoft Pocket PC Edition 2003, which makes running Outlook Express or Internet Explorer simple,? TTSL (east) chief operating officer Rajesh Puri says. Ego also has an in-built camera and flash along with photo-editing features. Being bluetooth and infrared-enabled, it is easy to download data from other phones as well as PCs,? says Puri.

 Priced at Rs 32,990, the pocket PC phone is aimed at increasing the corporate user segment. More than 100 units have already been sold since its launch around two weeks back. The pocket PC phone has been sourced from Taiwanese company HTC and is the first offering from a CDMA operator.

 TTSL is also promoting another enterprise product ? VData cards that will allow the user to stay connected to the Internet through a laptop at 156 kbps across 1500 towns in the circles where the company offers services.

 The card also enables the user to make calls without a network cable or mobile phones. ?We sold 110 units of VData in June and have crossed the figure in July. We have targeted a sales of around 250 units every month for the next few months,? Puri said. TTSL also plans to tie up with laptop vendors like HP and IBM to tap the channel retail customer.

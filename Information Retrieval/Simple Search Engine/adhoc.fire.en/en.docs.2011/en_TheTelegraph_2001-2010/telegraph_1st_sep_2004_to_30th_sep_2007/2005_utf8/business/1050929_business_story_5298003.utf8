 New Delhi, Sept. 28: A roadmap to streamline tax structure on all savings instruments will be rolled out next month. The committee, headed by R. Kannan of SBI Life Insurance, will define ways of bringing in uniformity in tax treatment on all savings schemes according to the ?exempt-exempt-taxed? (EET) model. The model proposes tax only at the withdrawal stage and exemptions at contribution and accumulation stages. ?We are looking at 90 short-term and all long-term savings instruments, including provident funds. We have to see which instruments come directly under the EET and which do not and whether it is possible to bring them under the EET within 4-5 years,? Kannan said.

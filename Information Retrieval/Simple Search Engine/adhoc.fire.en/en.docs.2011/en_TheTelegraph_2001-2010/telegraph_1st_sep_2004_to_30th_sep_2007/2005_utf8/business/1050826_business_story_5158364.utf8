 Reliance Info moves apex court on penalty

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: The Supreme Court today admitted a petition filed by Reliance Infocomm challenging the Telecom Dispute Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) order upholding the Rs 150-crore penalty imposed on it. Reliance was accused of masking overseas calls as local ones to avoid paying a higher access deficit charge (ADC) to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd.

 A bench of Justices Ashok Bhan and S.B. Sinha, which admitted the petition, also issued a notice to the Centre.

 Additional solicitor-general K.P. Pathak accepted the notice on behalf of the Centre.

 Senior counsel Harish Salve, appearing for Reliance Infocomm, submitted that a major question of law was involved in the appeal and that call re-routing was a global practice resorted to by all service providers, including telecom PSUs MTNL and BSNL.

 The department of telecommunications (DoT) had imposed a penalty of Rs 150 crore on Reliance Infocomm for violating the licence condition.

 Anil Ambani inherited this company as part of settlement between him and elder brother Mukesh. Under the new leadership, the company moved the Supreme Court for recovery of fine paid by it following the order of the TDSAT.

 In its petition, Reliance Infocomm said there was no violation of any law in call re-routing as it was a common technical procedure adopted by service providers all over the world.

 Reliance Infocomm, under Mukesh Ambani, paid the penalty under protest. Now, Anil is seeking a refund.

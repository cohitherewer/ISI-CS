 British Gas to invest more

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 17: British Gas (BG) plans to invest another $500 million in India to increase the output of the western offshore Panna Mukta oilfields and the Tapti gas fields and set up captive co-generation power plants for companies.

 BG chief executive Frank Chapman said the company will invest $250 million in power plants and another $250 million for further development of the Panna Mukta and Tapti fields.

 The fresh investments will be made in the next three to five years and will take the total investment of the company in India to $1 billion, he added.

 He said the gas output of the Tapti fields would be increased from 250 million standard cubic feet per day to 450 million standard cubic feet, while the gas output of the Panna Mukta fields would be enhanced from 75 million standard cubic feet to 135 million standard cubic feet per day.

 Chapman said BG had already received enquiries from two Delhi-based customers for captive co-generation of power of one mega watt capacity and above. 

 He said the company had already undertaken power generation and distribution projects in Sao Paulo in Brazil and ?we are now looking at the co-generation initiative in India?.

 BG India is a partner of ONGC and Reliance in the mid-sized Panna Mukta and Tapti fields in which it had bought the 30 per cent stake of Enron Corporation.

 Enron had made a killing by selling its stake for $350 million after having got its share for a song in the early eighties in the controversial privatisation of these ONGC-discovered fields.

 BG had in the beginning staked its claim to the operatorship of the field as it was replacing Enron, the initial operator. 

 However, the Indian companies had refused to budge in the light of the bitter experience that they had with Enron, which had been padding up costs as the operator. 

 ONGC, which owns a 40 per cent share in the fields, had also wanted to be the operator. Eventually, it decided to go in for a joint operatorship model in which all companies would have a say in the management.

 BG also has a major shareholding in two gas distribution companies ? Gujarat Gas Company and the Mumbai-based Mahanagar Gas Ltd. The two companies supply natural gas to over 40,000 customers in western India. BG also plans to set up 24 CNG stations in Gujarat, seven of which have already been put in place.

 Mumbai, Feb. 8: Pharmaceuticals major Wockhardt has set up joint ventures in Mexico and South Africa and a wholly-owned subsidiary in Brazil as part of its overseas expansion plan.

 The company today said it plans to target the European market by acquiring companies in France and Germany.

 ?We are establishing building blocks of our global footprint in bio-pharmaceuticals with majority JVs in Mexico, South Africa and a subsidiary in Brazil,? Wockhardt chairman Habil Khorakiwala said.

 He said the company has received nine approvals for bio-pharmaceuticals and expects another 25 during the year in Russia, former CIS countries, South America, southeast Asia and North Africa.

 In Mexico, it has teamed up with Representaciones E Investigaciones Medicas, S.A. de C.V. The joint venture, Wockhardt Mexico S. A. de C.V, will initially market all forms of insulin made by Wockhardt. It will later sell other diabetology and bio-pharmaceutical products, he said.

 The pharmaceuticals market in Mexico is valued at $7 billion, much bigger than India, and growing at 10 per cent. 

 A sales and marketing subsidiary ? Wockhardt Farmaceutica do Brasil ? has been set up to market its pharmaceutical and bio-pharmaceutical products in Brazil. 

 A 51:49 joint venture has been set up between Wockhardt South Africa pty Ltd and Wockhardt and Pharma Dynamics.

 Khorakiwala said these ventures mark a new milestone in the global journey with the company having a ground presence in almost all the major markets of the world.

 Bio-technology is now a strategic business unit and Dinesh Dua, with over 20 years of experience in chemical and pharmaceutical industries, will now lead the business as its president, he said.

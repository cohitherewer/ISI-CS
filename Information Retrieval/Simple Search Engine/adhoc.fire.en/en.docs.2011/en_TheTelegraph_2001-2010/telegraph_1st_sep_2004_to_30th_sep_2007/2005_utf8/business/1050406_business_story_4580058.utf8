 Essar Global to set up steel plant in Qatar

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 5: The Ruia-controlled Essar Global Limited (EGL) will set up a steel plant in Qatar in collaboration with Qatar Steel Company (Qasco).

 The plant, to be located at Mesaieed Industrial City, will have a capacity of 4 million tonnes and the investment will be in the region of $1.25 billion. Essar will have a stake in the project. However, the company declined to comment on the exact equity structure.

 A memorandum of understanding has been signed signed by Nasser bin Hamad al Thani, director and general manager of Qasco, and Ravi Ruia, vice-chairman of Essar, in the presence of Yousef Hussain Kamal, minister of finance and chairman of Qasco?s board of directors.

 The plant is expected to become operational in the first half of 2008 and will be completed in phases.

 Essar will also be the turn-key contractor for this project. Essar Constructions, a group company, will supply equipment besides providing project management services. Essar will provide high-grade iron ore pellets for the plant.

 The project will be implemented only if it gets techno-economic clearance and achieves full financial closure.

 ?Qatar is emerging as a prominent player on the international steel map. The demand for our products is rising. The expansion plans that we have in place reflect our commitment to satisfy the growing demand for Qasco in various markets around the world. Our reputation for high quality steel is undisputed and we are determined to create new benchmarks in quality,? Nasser bin Hamed al Thani said. 

 Ravi Ruia said Qatar has turned out to be a lucrative destination with a large reservoir of natural gas that could be used as feedstock.

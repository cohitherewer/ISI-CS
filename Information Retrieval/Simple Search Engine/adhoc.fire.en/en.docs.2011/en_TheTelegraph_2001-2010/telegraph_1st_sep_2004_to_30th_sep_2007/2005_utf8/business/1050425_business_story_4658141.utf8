 India Inc seeks steady rates

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 24: Stability in rates and focus on credit to exports, agriculture and infrastructure figure on the top of the industry?s wish list for Thursday?s credit policy.

 ?Interest rates should remain stable to sustain the growth rate. The industry expects the credit policy to be prudently formulated to meet the credit demand,? said Onkar Kanwar, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci). The industry body has conducted a survey in which most respondents want RBI to do more to cut cost of finance for exporters.

 On the benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR), the survey says it should be introduced, with adequate checks and balances. These include parameters like cost of funds, operational costs and level of non-performing assets and the risk profile of the investment.

 Companies also want a reduction in the spread between the borrowing and lending rates since this would help them raise resources at more competitive rates.

 Some 83 per cent of those polled in the Ficci survey believe that there should be separate NPA norms for loans to farmers and small and medium enterprises, given that the risk factors are much higher in these sectors.

 Nearly 80 per cent of the respondents feel that RBI should encourage foreign participation in securitised asset market. ?The presence of more players will add greater depth to the market. Also, local banks will gain from the global experience of foreign banks,? the survey states.

 Nearly 67 per cent respondents felt the need to check rupee appreciation in order to boost exports. Others wanted an increase in rates on NRI deposits by 0.25-0.5 per cent.

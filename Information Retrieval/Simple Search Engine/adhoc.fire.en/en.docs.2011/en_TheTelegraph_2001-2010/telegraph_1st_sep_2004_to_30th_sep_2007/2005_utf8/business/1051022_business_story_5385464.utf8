 Mukesh stake riddle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 21: Azim Premji owns over 80 per cent of the third largest information technology major Wipro Ltd. Premjis shareholding in Wipro Ltd has catapulted him to the top of the totem pole for the wealthiest Indians residing in the country. 

 While Premji is the wealthiest, many suspect that the wealthiest resident Indian family would be the Ambanis.

 The Tatas have never prided themselves to be owners of the companies they run. They prefer to call themselves trustees of the 80 odd group companies they control, with two charitable trusts holding the reins of Tata Sons Ltd, the main holding company.

 Ratan Tata holds a small individual stake in TCS which is worth a little over Rs 36 crore.

 But how much does Mukesh Ambani hold in Reliance Industries, either individually or jointly. No one really knew ? till now.

 A peak into Mukeshs individual shareholding (singly or jointly) mentioned in the copy of the notice convening the extraordinary general meeting reveals that the chairman of RIL holds 18.57 lakh shares in the flagship company. That makes the value of his RIL holdings worth about Rs 143.14 crore, perhaps small beer when compared with Premjis stake.

 By virtue of being the chairman of the largest private sector company, Mukesh controls close to 38 per cent in Reliance Industries, owned by the family through myriad trusts. 

 His cousins, Nikhil and Hital Meswani, own 1.21 lakh and 87,000 shares, respectively. 

 By the end of the EGM convened by the court to obtain shareholders? approval to separate the businesses controlled by the two Ambani brothers, Mukesh Ambani became richer by Rs 4.10 crore today as RIL shares gained a handsome sum of Rs 22.10 to Rs 770.45 when the markets bounced back.

 The Ambani family controls about 28 per cent, thus pegging the value of their holding at around Rs 31,000 crore. 

 Anil Ambani?s stake in RIL was not known. While his close confidant Amitabh Jhunjhunwala did not hold any shares in RIL, the younger Ambani brothers shareholding in RIL was not mentioned at all in the notice.

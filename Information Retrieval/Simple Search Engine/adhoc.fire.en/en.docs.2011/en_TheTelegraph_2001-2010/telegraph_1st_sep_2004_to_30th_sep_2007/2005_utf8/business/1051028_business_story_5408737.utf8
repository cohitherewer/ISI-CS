 Book air tickets through ATM

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 27: IDBI customers can now book their air tickets through the banks ATMs. 

 The first-of-its-kind facility will enable the customers to use their debit-cum-ATM card and key in the travel details to buy an airline ticket.

 IDBI has tied up with Indian Airlines for this offer. Customers can exchange the transaction slip generated by the ATM for a boarding pass at the airport if they produce identification proof.

 The bank has introduced this value-added service to take on the fierce competition in retail banking. For Indian Airlines, the facility will open yet another channel to raise its share in an equally competitive civil aviation environment. Initially, this facility will be available at 32 ATMs, mostly in Mumbai. Later, it will be introduced in over 300 ATMs across the country.

 IDBI chairman and managing director V.P. Shetty said even though the facility of booking air tickets through an ATM is not prevalent in any country at present, the bank has taken the initiative to add value to its services. IDBI has been adding innovative products as it risked losing customers in a competitive arena, he added.

 We plan to introduce more such advanced products on our technology platform. The airline ticket booking facility has the potential to attract new customers to IDBI, he added.

 IDBI customers can also make round-trip bookings for all sectors in the country where Indian Airlines flies. The customers can choose from the apex and full fares based on real-time availability. However, the facility will not be available for international flights.

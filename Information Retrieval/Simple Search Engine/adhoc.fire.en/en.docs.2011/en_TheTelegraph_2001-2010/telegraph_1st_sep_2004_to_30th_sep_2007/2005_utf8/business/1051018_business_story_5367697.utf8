The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Treo set to make a connect-call to 

 BlackBerry

 LAURIE J. FLYNN

 Joining hands 

 San Francisco, Oct. 17: Palm 

 Inc., maker of the Treo smartphone, and its rival Research 

 In Motion, the maker of the wireless BlackBerry device, 

 are expected to announce a licensing agreement soon that 

 could alter competition in the market for phones that offer 

 e-mail and other functions, one of the fastest-growing segments 

 of the cell phone industry. 

 As part of a broad strategy to 

 become a software company as well as a device maker, Research 

 In Motion, or RIM, will allow Treos to use its e-mail and 

 communications technology, called BlackBerry Connect. 

 The deal is significant because 

 it gives Palm, a 10-year-old Silicon Valley company, a greater 

 opportunity to sell Treos to corporations that have spent 

 substantial sums outfitting their workers with BlackBerrys, 

 which are still big sellers among business users. 

 Treo has gained momentum in the 

 corporate market because thousands of business software 

 programs can run on its devices. Over the last several months, 

 some cell phone makers, like Nokia and Sony Ericsson, have 

 also licensed BlackBerry Connect, but they have only recently 

 started promoting that service. 

 For RIM, the deal with Palm takes 

 the company further down the strategic path it announced 

 more than two years ago, after it became clear that the 

 company needed to reinvent itself if it wanted to maintain 

 its growth rate. 

 While RIM continues to sign up 

 new subscribers ? in its last quarter it added 620,000 accounts, 

 for a total of 3.65 million, its growth is starting to slow. 

 quot;It would have been a bigger 

 deal if they hadnt done it, quot; said John Jackson, 

 an analyst with the Yankee Group in Boston. quot;Its 

 a must-have. quot; 

 In 2004, the makers of smartphones 

 ? cell phones with advanced e-mail, calendar and other computing 

 functions ? sold about 3.2 million units. 

 This year, that figure is expected 

 to nearly double, to 6 million, and to reach 11 million 

 units in 2009, according to Jupiter Media, a research group. 

 quot;Its a highly lucrative 

 market that is widely perceived as being under-addressed, quot; 

 Jackson said. RIM, based in Waterloo, Ontario, was one of 

 the first companies to introduce a hand-held e-mail device, 

 and throughout the late 1990s the name BlackBerry became 

 synonymous with mobile e-mail. 

 But in recent years, Palm, Dell 

 and other device makers, along with phone companies like 

 Nokia and Motorola, have entered that market. 

 At the same time, RIM has been 

 under pressure from cellular carriers and its corporate 

 customers to strike a deal with Palm so that they can offer 

 a variety of devices with the BlackBerry software. 

 quot;Quite frankly, weve 

 had a very strong demand for BlackBerry on Treos, quot; 

 said James L. Balsillie, chief executive of RIM. quot;Our 

 biggest interest is going in and fulfilling that pent-up 

 demand. quot; 

 Michael Gartenberg, an analyst 

 with Jupiter Media, said, quot;Its a good idea for 

 them to let the market decide quot; what software and hardware 

 combinations customers can have. quot;You dont want 

 to back your customers into a corner. quot; 

 A big challenge for smartphone 

 companies is to make sure that their products can communicate 

 with other companies handsets. This is particularly 

 important for corporate customers, whose employees need 

 to be on compatible systems. 

 According to Ed Colligan, Palms 

 chief executive, the deal with RIM shows that firms must 

 form partnerships with their rivals to meet their customers 

 needs. 

 Initially, BlackBerry Connect 

 will be available only on the Treo 650, a popular version 

 of the Treo that runs the Palm operating system. Palm plans 

 to make it available later this year or early next year, 

 as soon as it completes deals with cellular carriers to 

 sell it.

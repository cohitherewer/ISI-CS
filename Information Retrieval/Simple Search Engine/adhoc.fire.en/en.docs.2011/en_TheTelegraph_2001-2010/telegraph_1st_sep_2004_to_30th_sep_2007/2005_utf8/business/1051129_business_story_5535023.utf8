 Rathi sees big leap in sensex

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Nov. 28: Sensex is poised to touch 10500 points by December 2006 and rise to 12000 points in the next couple of years, according to Anand Rathi of the Anand Rathi group.

 In the last five years, India has become a preferred destination for global investors, said Rathi, a prominent capital market player, after inaugurating his 175th office in the country and the first in Hyderabad. 

 Never in my last 40 years of involvement with the capital market have I ever seen such a growth drive, he said. 

 The equity market has posted an annualised return of 17 per cent in the last 25 years and is projected to grow at least 15 per cent in the next five years. 

 The investments in mutual funds will grow by 30 per cent in the next five years, he said.

 Rathi said the services sector would grow at double the rate of agriculture and manufacturing sectors. The services sector will contribute 75 of the GDP in the next 20 years and the share of agriculture and manufacturing will go down, he said.

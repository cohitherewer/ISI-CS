 New Delhi, Oct. 5: Hero Honda today launched its first scooter, the 100cc gearless Pleasure. It also unveiled Achiever, a 150cc motorcycle.

 The company is aiming at a one-million customer base for Pleasure by December 2006 in non-urban and new semi-urban markets in the country. It will also target women customers.

 Hero Honda, the market leader in the two-wheeler segment, will compete with Honda in the scooter business, where the Japanese firm enjoys a leadership position. 

 Officials refused to divulge the price of Pleasure, which will hit the market mid-November.

 Achiever, on the other hand, will be available in two variants with a price tag of Rs 47,900 and Rs 52,700.

 ?The scooter will be manufactured at our Gurgaon plant. Production of the four-stroke scooter will be done according to the market demand,? said Pawan Munjal, managing director, Hero Honda Motor Ltd.

 Hero Honda will also consider production of geared scooters. However, this will depend upon market demand. 

 ?We will wait and watch how the market develops, but we will certainly continue to be a major motorcycle player.?

 At present, motorcycles contribute 80 per cent sales in the two-wheeler market and the rest comes from scooters.

 Pleasure is specially designed for women. Less weight, self-start and new ?tuff up tube? technology, which offers immediate remedy in case of tyre puncture, would suit female riders, said Pawan Munjal.

 Speaking about the mileage of Pleasure, chairman Brijmohan Lall Munjal said, ?On road, it would be 50 plus km per litre... And for Achiever, it is between 55 to 60 km per litre.? 

 The company is aiming at selling 10,000 Achievers per month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Q amp;A

 Home truth

 My house is on a five-cottah land, the value of which was Rs 66,000 in 1977. Now, I plan to sell my home with the land for Rs 1.5 crore. However, I shall not purchase a house within three years and will invest the amount in RBI bonds. What will be my tax liability?

 S. N. Singh, Ranchi

 First, you will have to compute the current value of the acquisition cost by using the cost inflation index for the current financial year. 

 You may also include the indexed cost of improvements and the cost of transferring the property to arrive at the total acquisition cost. 

 Thereafter, you should deduct this amount from the sale proceeds and arrive at the capital gains amount, on which you will have to pay tax at a flat rate of 20 per cent.

 Beware of accidents

 I have taken a term insurance plan with the option of accidental death benefit. I have also taken a comprehensive motor car insurance. Will there be any problem in getting the benefit amount in case of accidental death from both the companies?

 James Paul, Calcutta

 There will be no problem in getting the benefit amount from both the companies since the nature of both the policies are different, one being a life insurance and the other being a general insurance policy.

 Old age worry

 I am 52 years old and wish to take a term insurance plan without medical test. Please let me know the maximum sum assured at my age and suggest some plans.

 C. J. Joseph, Calcutta

 Issuing a life insurance policy with or without medical examination is the discretion of the insurance company. And although the sum assured is dependent on the cover you choose and applicable premium amount, again, it may vary across various plans of the insurers and their underwriting rules.

 Tata Steel well in sync with new-age demands

 Mumbai, March 21: Tata Steel is betting big on ?the new age discontinuity for the steel industry?, which is expected to spur steel consumption in India to new highs.

 ?The steel industry is undergoing a discontinuous change,? said managing director B. Muthuraman.

 Alluding to major discontinuity in India that will see steel demand rising dramatically, he compared the steel demand in countries in Europe and in the US, which rose between 1975 to 2000 due to an infrastructure built-up and the high demand from the automobile sector.

 ?China has picked up the thread and so has India as the demand in advanced countries plateau,? Muthuraman said.

 Muthuraman said discontinuities occur in the steel industry by way of new technology or new products. 

 Worldwide six billion people consume one billion tonnes of steel. India consumes 150 kgs against European and Japanese consumption of 350-400 kgs. 

 Muthuraman is betting on Indians buying more refrigerators and vehicles in addition to the massive infrastructure development in the country. 

 ?Tata Steel will do well with its integrated outlook as it owns its own ore and coal mines, with only 40 per cent of its coal requirement outsourced. We had a long-term vision and we were fully integrated at a time when the industry was questioning our strategy,? he said.

 The Tata Steel managing director was speaking at a hurriedly-called conference after Tata Steel secured Moody?s Baa2 fundamental rating, which is higher than the sovereign rating of Baa3.

 Analysts say Moody?s rating could be a prelude to a plan to borrow funds from the international markets to finance expansion or better still a move to list abroad. 

 However, for a equity listing the company does not need a rating, a senior Tata official clarified. 

 ?This is merely to look at ourselves from an external eye,? Muthuraman said. 

 ?The rating demonstrates Tata Steel?s fundamental strength as a globally competitive steel company,? he added. The company plans to pursue growth in India and abroad through greenfield projects and acquisitions.

 The company will continue to follow prudent financial management norms in funding its future growth.

 Tata Steel is in the middle of a major expansion plan that will add 7 lakh tonnes of steel capacity by next year.

 The company has big plans for Orissa too, where it has acquired land. ?We hope to place orders by the end of this month,? Muthuraman said. 

 In Bangladesh, the company has planned a pre-feasibility study before a detailed project study is undertaken. It would take 6-9 months after the pre-feasibility study for the final study to be completed, before the company can take a decision whether to invest in Bangladesh, Muthuraman said.

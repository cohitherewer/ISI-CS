 Mumbai, Nov. 30: Motorola Inc today appointed former Tata group helmsman Firdose A. Vandrevala as the head of its India operations. 

 In October, Vandrevala quit as chairman of Tata Teleservices Maharashtra Ltd after a long stint with the Tata group, which span over more than three decades. He was associated in various capacities with the group?s steel, power and telecom businesses. 

 Speaking on Vandrevala?s appointment, Motorola regional president, Asia-Pacific, Simon Leung said, ?Motorola places high importance on the India market as part of its global strategy. Vandrevala?s abilities, coupled with Motorola?s technological leadership, are expected to help the company realise its growth objectives for India, which includes next-generation technologies.?

 Vandrevala will also be responsible for enhancing Mototrola?s ability to support integrated solutions for customers.

 Following Vandrevala?s resignation, the board of Tata Teleservices Maharashtra had invited group chairman Ratan Tata to join as an additional director and assume the role of the chairman, which he had accepted.

 Since this, speculations were rife on Vandrevala?s next move. He is joining Motorola at a time when the company is focussing on India. In August, Motorola?s CEO Ed Zander had visited India. 

 Recently, the company announced a series of initiatives to drive growth, which included setting up of a manufacturing base in the country.

 Motorola had established its R amp;D facility in Bangalore in 1991. The company claims to have the largest, most versatile and the fastest growing R amp;D presence in the country among other telecom MNCs. 

 The company?s development centres in Bangalore and Hyderabad are working on core technology and software development for next generation wireless infrastructure technologies and applications.

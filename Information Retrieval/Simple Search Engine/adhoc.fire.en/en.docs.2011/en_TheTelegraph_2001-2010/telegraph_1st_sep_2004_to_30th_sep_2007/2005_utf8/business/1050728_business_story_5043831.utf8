 Calcutta, July 27: Amid indications of a softening in steel prices in the near term, Tata Steel today announced a 24 per cent rise in first-quarter net profit at Rs 924.11 crore compared with Rs 745.49 crore in the corresponding previous period. Net sales rose to Rs 3,464.52 crore from Rs 3,164.65 crore. 

 However, production during the period was lower at 9.45 lakh tonnes compared with 9.93 lakh tonnes in the corresponding previous quarter. Steel sales were also lower at 8.54 lakh tonnes compared with 8.83 lakh tonnes in the year-ago period.

 The steel business generated Rs 3,031.52 crore in sales (Rs 2,900.38 crore), while revenues from ferro alloys and minerals stood at Rs 375.13 crore (Rs 305.03 crore).

 Last month, Tata Steel had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chhattisgarh government to set up a five-million-tonne integrated steel plant in the Bastar region. The company has also signed an agreement with AMCI Australia to buy a 5 per cent interest in the Carborough Downs Coal project in Queensland.

 The company has also signed a joint venture agreement with Iranian Mines and Mining Industries Development and Renovation Organisation (IMIDRO) to establish a 1.5-million-tonne steel slab-making facility, a 1.5-million-tonne billet making facility, a separate three-million-tonne export oriented steel plant. It will also carry out iron ore exploration and mining there.

 Tata Steel chairman Ratan Tata today said iron ore, a valuable resource, should not be exported to other countries. 

 An effort should be made so that we do not give away valuable resources like iron ore in return for operations in other countries, Tata said at Tata Steels annual general meeting here. 

 To a shareholders query on Korean steel company Posco setting up a plant in India, he said the project does envisage export of iron ore. He said companies should not be allowed to export iron ore in excess of what they use.

 The per capita consumption of steel in the country is extremely low and new plants would help meet demand, he said. 

 On Mittal Steel, he said the group has planned a greenfield plant but it would be a departure from its (Mittal) model of raising capacity through acqusitions. It is only a proposal, he added.

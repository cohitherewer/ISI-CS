 Ex-envoy to rebuild VWs Andhra bridge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Damage control

 Hyderabad, July 26: Volkswagen AG has appointed Frank Elbe, a former German ambassador to India, as its special envoy to undertake damage control measures in the wake of the scam by its former employee Helmuth Schuster. This was indicated to Andhra chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy by Volkswagen chairman Bernd Pischetrsieder in a letter. 

 He said the Volkswagen India project was temporarily put on hold because of the recent unexpected and unpleasant incidents. 

 According to present findings by auditor KPMG, Schuster had acted in India without authority and also misled the state of Andhra Pradesh. With respect to the payments to Vashisht Wahan arranged by Andhra Pradesh, Volkswagen will assume responsibility for the damage caused by the suspected illegal dealings of Schuster, quot; he said. 

 Elbe will take the Volkswagen India project further. Elbes responsibility will be to communicate to the Indian authorities the companys firm intention to prevent and avoid any damage to the present and future relations of Volkswagen with India, he added. 

 The Volkswagen chief also asked the Andhra Pradesh government to consider sending its delegation to Germany after discussions with Elbe. 

 The government is jubilant over the letter from Wolsberg as it had lost faith on emails from Germany. It was an email from Schuster on January 7 that had prompted the state government to release the equity participation without even scrutinising the legalities of Vashisht Wahan. 

 State industry secretary Lakshmi Parthasarathy has requested the German firm to speed up its decision on locating the car plant at Vishakhapatnam where the government has already gone ahead with land acquisition and arranged other infrastructure facilities like power and water.

 The state government also decided yesterday to distance itself from the suo motto investigations taken up by Lokayukta Justice R. Ramanujam into the payment of Rs 11.56 crore by Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation. 

 The government felt that there was no need for another inquiry when the case was already handed over to the CBI.

 Meanwhile, the state government has found documents establishing connections of Vashisht Wahan director Jagadish Alagar Raja with several Telugu Desam members.

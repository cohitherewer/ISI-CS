 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, July 28: Mahindra amp; Mahindra has posted a 40 per cent rise in first-quarter net profit at Rs 145.3 crore compared with Rs 103.9 crore in the corresponding previous period.

 The rise in profit was due to a good sales performance by both the automotive and farm equipment sectors, containment of operating expenditure and reduction in financial costs, the company said.

 M amp;M said gross sales and income from operations were Rs 2,049.2 crore compared with Rs 1,686 crore in the same period last year.

 Net sales and income from operations at Rs 1,811.9 crore registered a growth of 27 per cent over Rs 1,423.2 crore last fiscal, it said.

 Giving a positive outlook, the company, however, listed rising oil and raw material prices as areas of concern.

 Ranbaxy net down 

 Intense pricing pressure in the US has pulled down Ranbaxys second-quarter net profit by 48 per cent.

 The company today reported a profit after tax (and minority interest) of Rs 101.3 crore compared with Rs 195.8 crore for the same period last year.

 There has been an intense pricing pressure in the US and it has affected our profit in this quarter, Ranbaxy CEO and managing director Brian W Tempest said.

 He said the pressure is expected to continue through the year, although the company expected better results in the next two quarters.

 L amp;T profit

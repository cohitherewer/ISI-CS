 Chevron bottomline doubles 

 Oil on the boil 

 New York, Jan. 29 (Reuters): ChevronTexaco Corp, the No 2 US oil company, has nearly doubled its quarterly profit, driven by record crude oil prices and soaring refining margins. 

 The results were well above Wall Street forecasts and capped a record year marked by the highest annual profit in its history, due in large part to the jump in energy prices. 

 But the company disappointed some with its declining production figures, and its shares fell amid a broader drop in crude prices ahead of Sunday?s Opec meeting and the Iraq elections. 

 Oil and gas production fell about 9 per cent in the quarter because of properties sold off and from disruptions due to the damage inflicted by Hurricane Ivan in the Gulf of Mexico. 

 ?These guys are running hard, not making really any major progress in terms of production growth,? said Gene Gillespie, analyst with Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs Inc., adding that he had expected the company?s overseas production segment to perform better. 

 Others, such as Credit Suisse First Boston analysts, wrote that the production figures were nothing to fret about, but rather the results showed a ?good set of numbers?.

 Either way, lofty crude prices and a more than four-fold rise in earnings from refining and marketing operations ensured that the company?s bottomline reflected a mammoth gain. 

 Net income in the fourth quarter rose to $3.44 billion, or $1.63 a share, compared with $1.74 billion, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier. 

 Excluding special items like foreign currency, the company?s profit was roughly $1.58 a share, estimated Gillespie. That was still well above consensus forecasts of $1.38 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. 

 Revenues jumped 39 per cent to $42.69 billion. 

 Crude oil prices touched a peak in late October, as soaring demand from Asian giants like India and China as well as fears of disruptions in supply from countries like Russia, Nigeria and Iraq kept energy prices aloft for much of the past year. 

 Average prices in the fourth quarter for crude oil and natural gas both in the United States and abroad were up 40 per cent, ChevronTexaco said. 

 Another US oil producer, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. also reported a surge in quarterly profit on Friday due to the ascent in oil and gas prices. Its earnings rose 38 percent. 

 The cash windfall from the record prices allowed ChevronTexaco to cut debt by $1.3 billion over the year, buy back shares and pump money into its pension plans. 

 But the company has continued to feel a lingering pain from Hurricane Ivan?s visit last fall, with damage stemming from it expected to restrict production in the first quarter by about 35,000 barrels per day. Most of the remaining shut production is expected to be restored in the second quarter. 

 Overall, exploration and production earnings rose to $2.23 billion in the fourth quarter from a $1.56 a year earlier.

 VSNL slashes broadband rates

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 16: Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL), which has been systematically reducing international bandwidth tariffs, today announced a cut of up to 45 per cent on the Tata Indicom Cable. This came as an Independence Day offer for consumers.

 The company had chalked out a plan to rationalise international bandwidth tariffs in 2002 and the move is part of that roadmap.

 With tariffs being reduced six times in the last four years, prices of international private lines have come down from Rs 40 lakh in 2001 to Rs 11 lakh for E1 ? a digital transmission link used predominantly in Europe. The link has a capacity of 2 mbps, according to a statement issued by the company.

 Tariffs have also come down from Rs 7.25 crore to Rs 1.14 crore for DS3, a high-speed line capable of delivering around 45 mbps, and also for STM-1, a circuit with a 155-mbps capacity. These prices are for restorable capacities between India and the US.

 VSNL said its recent initiatives of building the Tata Indicom Cable and acquiring the TGN have given it a greater control of the international bandwidth cost components.

 The company has already reduced prices on the Tata Indicom Cable by about 48 per cent in the six months since the cable was put into service. 

 VSNL has been participating in undersea cable consortium networks to bring international bandwidth in India.

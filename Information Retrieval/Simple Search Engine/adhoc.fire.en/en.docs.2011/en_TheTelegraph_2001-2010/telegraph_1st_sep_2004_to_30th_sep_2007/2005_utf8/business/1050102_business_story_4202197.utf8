 NTPC focus on power trading

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Jan. 1: Power trading is gaining momentum with National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) appointing the Nordic Power Exchange as consultant to establish an IT-enabled system and a nationwide power exchange.

 The Nordic Power Exchange runs the world?s oldest and one of the most successful power pooling systems ? the Nord Pool.

 The exchange mechanism being envisaged would be a spot market for power, providing a platform for buyers and sellers of electricity to strike trading deals on a realtime basis. 

 The project is being undertaken by NTPC?s trading subsidiary ? NTPC Vidyut Vyapar Nigam Ltd. The other members of the consulting team, which was shortlisted through a bidding process, include Crisil Advisory Services and Millhouse Associates, power sector sources said. 

 At present, several utilities such as Damodar Valley Corporation, Neepco and states, including Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Uttaranchal and Sikkim, are selling their surplus power to others through traders such as Power Trading Corporation (PTC) and Global Energy Ltd.

 Senior power industry officials said the idea of an exchange is to enable the states to bypass traders and buy or sell power without any middleman. Also, a 2-3 days time lag for striking deals would be eliminated after an exchange is established. Deals can then be completed realtime.

 An exchange will help power producers retain higher trading margins, they said. 

 Sellers of power can quote their prices for delivering electricity to a particular nodal point, which will then be intimated to interested parties.

 Buyers can then strike a deal to purchase a requisite quantity of power that can be transferred to the point of consumption using the existing grid infrastructure.

 As the Electricity Act, 2003 permits open access in transmission, a buyer can wheel power to its location using the existing transmission infrastructure of Power Grid Corporation Ltd or the transmission and distribution facilities of respective state electricity boards.

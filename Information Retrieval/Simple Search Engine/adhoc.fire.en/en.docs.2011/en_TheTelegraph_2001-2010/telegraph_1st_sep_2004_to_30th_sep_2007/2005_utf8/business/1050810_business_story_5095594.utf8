 New Delhi Aug 9: India and Pakistan have decided to temporarily shelve the opening up of the Wagah-Attari land route for trade on a permanent basis. 

 The commerce secretaries of both countries discussed the issue today and concluded that the route cannot be opened until the infrastructure bottlenecks are addressed.

 The two nations are planning to set up a joint study group on trade, sources said. The sub-group on customs and trade facilitation and non-tariff barriers would meet in September to chalk out the future course.

 The Indian side is led by commerce secretary S.N. Menon and the Pakistani team by acting commerce secretary Syed Asif Shah.

 India also gave a fresh list of items to Pakistan to be included in the positive list. Pakistan said it would look into the matter at the time of reviewing the list.

 According to sources, Pakistan has already put 70 items on the ?positive? list of importable items from India and new additions are not possible immediately.

 Meanwhile, Pakistan is reported to have refused to throw open its market to diesel imports from India. 

 Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) had offered to sell 325,000 tonnes of diesel to Pakistan in October and March at a discount.

 Pakistan, which imports 4-5 million tonnes of diesel from Kuwait every year, had sought price quotations from IOC for importing diesel at Lahore, Jhelum and Karachi.

 Last week, Pakistan had lifted the ban on sugar import from India in a bid to stem the rise in sugar prices in the neighbouring country. 

 It is also keen to import potatoes, onions, tomatoes and livestock from India as domestic prices of food items have soared.

 The two countries have made some headway regarding improving the air and sea links between the two countries.

 ?There is some forward movement on improving the air and sea links. For this, the two nations will enter into fresh civil aviation and shipping agreements,? a senior official said. Technical groups from both sides will meet next month to thrash out the agreements.

 The two countries have decided to enhance co-operation in the banking sector and also offer insurance support to exporters. 

 For further co-operation in the financial sector and capital markets, both have agreed to enter into a memorandum of understanding between the Securities and Exchange Board of India and the Pakistan stock market regulator.

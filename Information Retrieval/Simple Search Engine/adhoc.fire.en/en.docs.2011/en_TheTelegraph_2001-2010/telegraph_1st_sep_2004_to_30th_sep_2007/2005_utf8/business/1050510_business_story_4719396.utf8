 Kuwait, May 9 (Reuters): The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) will not consider increasing its production levels at its meeting next month in Vienna. Opec president Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah said this citing that the markets were oversupplied.

 ?We cant increase production now,? Sheikh Ahmad told at an industry function in southern Kuwait, when asked if Opec will decide an output hike at its June 15 meeting. 

 ?Now, Opecs production has reached 29.7 million barrels per day (BPD), up 2 million BPD since mid-March, which has created a surplus in the markets of over 1.2 million BPD,? said Sheikh Ahmad, who is also Kuwaits oil minister. 

 Early this month, he had said the production figure of 29.7 million BPD was from Opec 10, which excludes Iraq. The lions share of the extra crude is being pumped by top exporter Saudi Arabia. along with fellow Gulf producers Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates. Opecs official production ceiling is 27.5 million BPD. 

 The cartel president also said the price hike was not due to any supply shortages. The US light crude closed just shy of $51 a barrel on Friday. 

 ?The market is supported by suitable quantities of oil that exceed global demand. Therefore, there is no worry over supply shortages in world markets,? he said. ?But there is always a psychological worry in addition to geopolitical circumstances that impact price differentials,? he added pointing at the $1-plus swings. 

 ?The oil price is not only linked to the supply and demand, but rather at this stage in particular, it is linked to the political, economic and climatic factors, which created this big difference up or down in prices,? Sheikh Ahmad said. He, however, added the cartel would boost its capacity by 1 million BPD by year end. ?This is not counting what non-Opec countries are doing.?

 Current production by Kuwait, which sits on a tenth of global oil reserves, was about 2.7 million BPD.

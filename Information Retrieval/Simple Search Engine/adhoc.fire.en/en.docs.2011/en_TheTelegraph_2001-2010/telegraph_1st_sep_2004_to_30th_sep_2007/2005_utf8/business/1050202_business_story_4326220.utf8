 Eyes on US rates, markets cool off 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 1: Markets paused for breath today after four straight sessions of gains as it cocked its ears for sound bites that will come out of a US rate-setting huddle.

 The sensex ended at 6552.47, a fall of 3.47 points from Monday?s 6555.94, after opening at 6565.21 and swinging between 6586.66 and 6508.84. The index has jumped more than 7 per cent on the back of encouraging third-quarter figures and the decision to free pension cash for shares.

 The meeting of US Federal Reserve is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points, but analysts will be watching signals to see whether the hikes will be rapid or gradual.

 Foreign institutional investors have been on a buying binge over the past few days. They pumped in more than Rs 600 crore on Friday, when the sensex soared 180 points. According to Sebi figures, their net investments in shares was Rs 895 crore, or $203.60 million, on Monday; it is Rs 1,352 crore since the year began.

 Hindustan Lever and Bajaj Auto Ltd were the few stocks that bucked the negative trend today. HLL saw its share rise Rs 8.95 to Rs 168.80. The Bajaj Auto stock jumped Rs 11.45 to Rs 1,049.25.

 New Delhi, Jan. 5: LG Electronics India Limited (LGEIL) plans to invest Rs 1,200 crore over the next five years. 

 The company today launched ?digi-direct? televisions supporting the direct-to-home (DTH) technology.

 Priced between Rs 14,000 and Rs 25,000, the televisions will be available in flat-screen models of 21 inches and 29 inches. The company expects a turnover of Rs 6,500 crore in calendar year 2004 and Rs 50,000 crore by 2010. It has set a turnover target of Rs 9,000 crore in 2005.

 With an investment of Rs 10 lakh to develop ?digi direct? sets, LG targets to sell nearly a lakh units by the year-end.

 LG Electronics president (Southwest Asia) K. R. Kim said the Indian unit is projecting sales of over 15 million GSM mobile handsets this year. Of this, approximately 20 per cent will be exported. The destinations include West Asia and South Africa.

 Investments in LGEIL were largely aimed at doubling the India?s share in the company?s overall operations to 10 per cent in the next five years. ?At present, India contributes about 5 per cent to LG?s overall operations. We are targeting to double it by 2010,? said Kim. 

 About 40 per cent of the total investment will be for the colour television segment and a similar percentage for home appliances. The company had earmarked Rs 300 crore for its R amp;D centre at Bangalore to customise mobile phones for the domestic market.

 LG also plans to set up a manufacturing facility in Chennai, in addition to its plants in Pune and Noida (near Delhi). ?Details are still being worked out,? said Kim.

 LG claims that its range of ?digi-direct? televisions will be able to receive all free-to-air channels ? 33 TV channels, including 17 Doordarshan, 12 radio and 2 FM channels.

 In March, the company will introduce one model each in 20 and 21 inches in its conventional category.

 The ?digi direct? models do not need a separate set-top box and remote control for DTH function.

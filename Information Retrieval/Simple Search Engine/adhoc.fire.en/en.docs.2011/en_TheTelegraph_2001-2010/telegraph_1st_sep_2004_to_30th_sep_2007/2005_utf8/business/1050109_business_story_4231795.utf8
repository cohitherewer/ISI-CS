The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Blame for scams knocks on boardroom doors

 BEN WHITE

 Washington, Jan. 8: Most of the punishment from the recent wave of business scandals has fallen on corporate executives and in some cases the accountants and other professionals who advised them. 

 But corporate board members, who are directly responsible for protecting shareholder interests, have largely escaped untouched. Now that may be changing. 

 A handful of recent developments, highlighted by the tentative agreement of 10 former WorldCom Inc. outside directors to pay $18 million of their own money as part of a $54 million settlement of a shareholder lawsuit, suggests that board members at scandal-ridden companies may indeed wind up paying a significant price for failing to stop alleged misdeeds. 

 What was once a gilded position offering hefty compensation for minimal work is becoming a more challenging job fraught with the risk of significant financial liability. quot;All of this will make directors begin to take their jobs far more seriously than they do now, quot; said Laura Thatcher, an attorney and corporate governance expert at the law firm Alston amp; Bird LLP. 

 The legal landscape surrounding corporate board members is clearly shifting. 

 In addition to the WorldCom settlement, directors at Walt Disney Co are being sued in Delaware over their approval of a $140 million severance package given to Michael Ovitz, who spent a disastrous 14 months as Disneys president. Experts said that before the rash of scandals, such a case would likely never have made it to court. 

 New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer filed suit last year against former New York Stock Exchange director Kenneth Langone over Langones role in engineering a $139.5 million payment to then-NYSE chairman Dick Grasso. Spitzer sued Grasso as well. 

 In May, a judge in Delaware found two outside directors at Emerging Communications Inc liable for approving a sale price for the company that shareholders said was too low. The judge said the two directors possessed enough financial expertise to know the deal was not a good one. 

 Former outside directors at Enron Corp, meanwhile, agreed last year to pay a total of $1.5 million out of their own pockets to settle a suit filed by the department of labour. 

 Until the Enron and WorldCom settlements, the idea that directors would pay a penny of their own money to shareholders was almost laughable. Stanford University professor Michael Klausner has studied the issue and said directors paid out of pocket around five times in the past 35 years. quot;You are talking about needles in haystacks,? he said. ?The numbers are very small.? 

 Many observers applaud the apparently toughening standards. Others worry they will scare qualified candidates away from serving on boards. quot;The directors and director candidates I talk to will ask, ?Are we setting a precedent under which I will be held personally liable for something that I had little control over?? said Joe Goodwin, president of the Goodwin Group, a consulting firm that specializes in chief executive and director searches. In the case of the tentative WorldCom settlement, however, several analysts discounted the possibility of a chilling effect. 

 They said the magnitude of WorldComs collapse puts the company in a much higher echelon of misbehaviour than most other firms. 

 In addition, the judge overseeing the WorldCom class-action suit issued an opinion last month saying a registration statement filed by WorldCom with the Securities and Exchange Commission prior to a bond issue in 2001 included quot;false and misleading quot; information. 

 Henry T.C. Hu, professor of corporate and securities law at the University of Texas at Austin, said that under federal securities law, directors and underwriters could be held personally liable if they signed falsified registration statements.

 Rescue plan for China Aviation Oil

 Singapore, Nov. 8 (Reuters): BP, the worlds second-largest oil firm, is among the four foreign investors negotiating for stakes as part of a rescue plan for China Aviation Oil (CAO) (Singapore) Corp. Ltd., a source said on Tuesday.

 The investors are expected to help revive the aviation fuel importer, which imploded last November under more than half a billion dollars of oil trading losses.

 The oil traders 60-per cent China-owned parent is still in talks with Temasek Holdings of Singapore for a joint $130 million cash injection.

 The two other potential foreign investors are a European oil company and a financial fund, said the source close to the situation. The talks could conclude by next week, he added.

 CAO Singapore and BP both declined to comment.

 A deal with BP would give it an opening to expand in China, now tightly controlled by state-owned companies. BP is eager to replicate in Asia the success it had in breaking into Russia.

 CAO holds a near-monopoly on Chinas jet fuel imports and is the international procurement arm of China Aviation Oil Holding Co.

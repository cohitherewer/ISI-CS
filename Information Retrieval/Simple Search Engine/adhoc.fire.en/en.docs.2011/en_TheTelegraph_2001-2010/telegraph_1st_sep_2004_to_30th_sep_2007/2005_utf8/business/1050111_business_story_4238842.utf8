 Singh: Swinging into action

 New Delhi, Jan. 10: A day ahead of the start of the finance ministers traditional pre-budget consultations, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh held a closed-door meeting with top economists who are members of his economic advisory committee to brainstorm on possible tax initiatives that the government may take in this year?s budget. 

 Singh?s meeting with top economists, including former RBI governor C. Rangarajan and well-known economists Suresh Tendulkar and Govind Rao, focussed on the tax reforms necessary in this budget as well as measures to keep inflation in control and give citizens relief from rising prices.

 Sources said the meeting indicates that the Prime Minister will probably play a more pro-active role in this year?s budget-making process and not leave most of the decisions to finance minister P. Chidambaram, as he did the last time round. 

 In the UPA government?s first budget in July last year, the proposals to raise the FDI limits in insurance, telecom and civil aviation had sparked off a row with the Left parties. Sources indicated the government wished to avoid a similar embarrassment.

 The Prime Ministers advisers also discussed social sector initiatives like the employment guarantee scheme that were to be highlighted in this years budget as part of the Congress-led government?s bid to bring a populist face to an ongoing economic reforms programme. 

 Rangarajan said, ?We discussed the price situation, taxation, employment guarantee scheme among other things.?

 Sources said the other issues that were discussed related to hard currency fund flows and the measures to raise the investment rate in crucial sectors, including infrastructure.

 Sources said the Prime Minister had asked the council to come up with suggestions on enlarging the tax base even as the government moved towards lowering excise and customs duties, the main revenue earners. 

 The economists were in favour of hard decisions like pruning the fiscal deficit to be blended with populist measures like raising the tax exemption limit and throwing in saving sops. 

 The government and its advisers know that the environment for hard decisions remained ?tough? with the Left continuing to oppose key decisions which they feel could hit the middle class badly.

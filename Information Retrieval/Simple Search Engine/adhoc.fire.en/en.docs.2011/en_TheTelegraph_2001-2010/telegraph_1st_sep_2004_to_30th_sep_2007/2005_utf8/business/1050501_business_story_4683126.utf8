 Israeli ally exits Mysore Cement

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 30: Nesher Israel Cement Enterprises Limited, the foreign equity partner in Mysore Cement, has exited from the SK Birla-controlled company.

 It has sold its entire 2.37 per cent stake in Mysore Cement to GCC Investment amp; Trading Co. Ltd, a promoter group company, in an off market deal.

 The transaction brought to an end the long-standing relationship between the two companies. Nesher picked up a 9.06 per cent stake in 1999 by paying a premium of Rs 10 over shares of face value of Rs 10.

 It was a widely-held belief then that the presence of an international player will help Mysore Cement get its Rs 600-crore Gulbarga project, with a capacity of 1.5 million tonne, going. In fact, it also floated a joint venture with Nesher for the project. However, due to the dull market condition, the project did not see the light of the day then.

 According to sources, Nesher had sold its stake as the company was not keen on its presence in India. Nesher?s promoter and the management has also changed and so has its business strategy.

 Nesher had been offloading its stake in small tranches. For instance on March 31, 2004, it had a 7.28 per cent stake. The Israeli company was classified as the persons acting in concert (PAC) category in the shareholding pattern filed with the bourses.

 Thus, the promoters? holding in the company will not change per se after the latest deal. GCC held a 5.29 per cent stake in Mysore Cement. Following this deal, GCC?s stake will go up to 7.56 per cent. As on March 31, 2005, promoters? stake in the company is 23.52 per cent, while financial institutions hold 33.78 per cent. 

 ?The cement market in the country has improved a lot. It is not surprising that the Birlas are raising their stake in the company,? sources said.

 Mysore Cement, incorporated in 1958, has a capacity of 1.9 million tonnes. It manufactures ordinary and pozzolona variety of portland cement. It has plants in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and a grinding unit in Uttar Pradesh.

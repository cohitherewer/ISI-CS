 Cadbury sees robust sales

 London, Dec. 13 (Reuters): Cadbury Schweppes, the worlds largest confectionery group, said on Tuesday it was set for its strongest sales growth for a decade in 2005 as it planned investments in Poland, Mexico and Turkey.

 The maker of Dairy Milk chocolate, Trident gum and Dr Pepper drinks said it was on track to hit the top of its sales growth target of 3-5 per cent for 2005, but added it was unlikely to meet its profit margin goal. We are looking forward to reporting our best sales growth for a decade, said CEO Todd Stitzer after the group issued a trading statement ahead of 2005 results in February.

 Stitzer declined to give a specific forecast for sales this year but analysts estimated growth around 5.7 per cent, as well as a 25 basis point rise in 2005 operating margins, below its annual target for a 50 to 75 basis point increase.

 The group gave a warning on margins in early October after costs rose strongly in the second half, particularly in the United States, due to higher oil prices, hurricane-related disruption and a rise in glass bottle prices after a major supplier filed for bankruptcy protection.

 Stitzer said cost pressures would still be very challenging into 2006, but he hoped to offset this with further cost cutting under its Fuel for Growth programme and with price rises.

 This is a quality result. Cadbury is resisting the temptation to rescue earnings by cutting marketing, and is investing for the long-term health of the firm, said analyst David Lang at Investec Securities.

 Analysts say Cadbury shares trade around 16.5 times forecast 2006 earnings, a small discount to its peers such as Nestle SA and Danone.

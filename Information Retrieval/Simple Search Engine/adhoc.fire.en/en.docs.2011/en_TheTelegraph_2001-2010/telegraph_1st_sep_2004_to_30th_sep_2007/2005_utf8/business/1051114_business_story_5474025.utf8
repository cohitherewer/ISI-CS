 Jacobs: Get them going

 Mumbai, Nov. 13: Qualcomm Ventures, a venture capital firm of the US-based Qualcomm, will set up base in India to fund local entrepreneurs.

 Irwin Mark Jacobs, founder chairman of Qualcomm, told The Telegraph, We will invest in start-ups in India that bring bright ideas to the table. 

 Qualcomm has pioneered the CDMA technology for mobile phone networks like Reliance Infocomm and Tata Teleservices. Irwin has led the commercialisation of the CDMA technology, which is the basis for all third-generation wireless networks.

 Irwin said his firm would continue to invest in India to expand its research and delivery centres in Hyderabad and Mumbai. At present, we have 200 people at the two centres and we will continue to expand by hiring more, he added.

 The companys plan to bring Qualcomm Ventures, a $500-million fund (Rs 2250 crore), is significant as the affiliate is active in CDMA technology-friendly countries like South Korea, Japan and China, besides the US. 

 Qualcomm Ventures was set up to focus on strategic investments in promising, start-up companies that can deliver new capabilities and accelerate CDMA usage worldwide.

 Qualcomm sees a large chunk of its users coming from India, where small entrepreneurs are developing world-class product software. The CDMA user base in India is expanding rapidly and already reached 20 million in October.

 Each strategic investment is expected to be up to $10 million (Rs 45 crore).

 The new venture group will target investments in communication devices and applications; wireless communication components and infrastructure; Internet infrastructure, content and services; and enabling and complementary technologies.

 Qualcomm Ventures is managed by Irwins son, Jeff Jacobs. In his current role, Jeff is responsible for the companys investments, strategic partnerships and new business opportunities. Its experience in telecommunications and the Internet uniquely position it to lead the convergence of these industries through strategic investments.

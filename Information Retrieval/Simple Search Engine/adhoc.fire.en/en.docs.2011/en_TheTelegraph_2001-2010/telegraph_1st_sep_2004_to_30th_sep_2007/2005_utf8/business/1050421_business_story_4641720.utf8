 FDA nod sought for oral insulin

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Bangalore, April 20: Biocon Ltd will seek the United States? FDA approval in December for its oral insulin. The clinical trials will kick off after getting that clearance.

 ?We are filing an application with the FDA for approval to commence human clinical trials on oral insulin ? a first-of-its-kind product. We have already carried out pre-clinical animal toxicity studies in collaboration with the US-based Nobex. Once our integrated new drug application is cleared by the FDA, we will be able to begin clinical trials in 2006,? CMD Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said.

 She said the clinical trials would last three to four years. ?In the meantime, we will be able to assess the market potential, keeping in view the growing number of diabetic patients in the sub-continent and all the world,? she said.

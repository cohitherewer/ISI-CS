 Nirupam speaks market lingo

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Sen: All praises

 Calcutta, July 13: Industries need to change and reinvent themselves in the face of changing demands, market and technology, state commerce and industries minister Nirupam Sen said today in the Assembly, referring to the state governments policy on restructuring public sector enterprises.

 All industries cannot survive forever? some will have to go and others have to be changed? it is an ever-changing process, the minister said. There is no object that does not restructure itself ? I am saying this from a philosophic point of view as well as a Marxist, he added. 

 However, Sen hastened to add that the government had not taken up the restructuring process without ignoring the interest of workers. We have tried for many years to salvage the loss-making units from our budget, but it would not be possible to save these units without radically restructuring them. The public sector, too, has to run profitably? the minister said.

 Stating that many people had lost their jobs because of restructuring, the minister added that this is inevitable in any part of the world. However, it is important to see that the interest of workers is not ignored, he said. 

 In the case of Great Eastern Hotel, the government had promised that till the hotel was transferred to new hands, employees would get their salaries. Also, the government had told prospective buyers to offer jobs to employees in the new set-up according to their competence. The state government had also arranged training programmes for those offered early retirement to help them find alternative job opportunities, Sen said. No other state or the Centre has been as sympathetic as the Left Front government in this matter, he added.

 Regarding the investment climate in Bengal, Sen said investment in the iron and steel sector had been good, but it could have been more had there not been the narrow-mindedness of some states. It is unfortunate that an investment proposal has not yet worked out despite the offer. We are talking to neighbouring states on this, the minister added. 

 The OP Jindal group has proposed to set up a 5-million-tonne integrated steel plant in Bengal. However, the state government is in a tussle with Jharkhand over the iron ore linkage problem. He said the state had brought it to the Centres notice and Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had already written to his Jharkhand counterpart, Arjun Munda, expressing willingness to discuss the matter. 

 There are three to four project proposals in Bengal, which have iron-ore linkage problems, he said later.

 Earlier in the Assembly, the minister mentioned that a draft feasibility report on the possibility of bio-technology parks in the state had recently been submitted. 

 Rajarhat, Haldia and Kharagpur are the three areas prioritised (in the draft) for this, Sen said. The state is already considering taking over a 500-acre land adjacent to Rajarhat for a biotech park.

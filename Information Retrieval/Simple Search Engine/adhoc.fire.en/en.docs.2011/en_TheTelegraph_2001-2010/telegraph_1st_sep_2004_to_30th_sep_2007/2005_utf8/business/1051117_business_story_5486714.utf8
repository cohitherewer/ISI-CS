 Govt mulls duty tweak to check inflation

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said he would not hesitate to take fiscal measures to check inflation, though he hoped the monetary steps taken by the Reserve Bank would keep a lid on oil-led inflationary pressures.

 Crediting the central bank with taking prudent monetary steps to keep inflation below 5 per cent despite a surge in global oil prices, the minister said, The government will stand by and not hesitate to take any fiscal measures.

 Petrol prices are expected to harden in the winter months because of increased demand for heating oil in the US and Europe. Chidambaram said 50 per cent of the inflation was due to oil prices, though the government had worked out a deal which did not give a full pass-through to global oil price hikes. 

 The minister indicated that the government could take fiscal measures, such as a cut in tariffs, to reduce import costs if inflation spiralled out of control. Wholesale inflation is at 4.75 per cent and is projected at 5.0-5.5 per cent by March-end. The RBI raised short-term repo rates last month by a quarter of a percentage to 5.25 per cent to suck out excess money in the market and curb inflationary pressures. 

 Chidambaram said he was confident the government would meet its fiscal deficit target of 4.3 per cent of gross domestic product this fiscal. The finance minister, however, dismissed suggestions that his ministry will allow petroleum firms to waive tax payments. I have not heard of any acute distress among oil companies ... he said.

 Yukos sues four Russian firms 

 Houston, Feb. 12 (AFP): Russian oil giant Yukos has informed a US court of its plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection and has announced that it is suing four Russian energy groups for more than $20 billion for their role in the sale of its core production asset. The suit names state-owned gas behemoth Gazprom, Gazpromneft, Baikalfinansgroup, and state-run oil producer Tosneft, seeking ?in excess of $20 billion for their role in expropriating Yuganskneftgaz in December 2004,? a Yukos statement yesterday said.

 The company also said it had filed a plan of reorganisation with the bankruptcy court of the southern district of Texas explaining ?how it plans to complete its chapter 11 case and treat fairly its creditors, shareholders and the Russian government in that plan.?

 Yukos said it had asked the court to set May 1, 2005 as the deadline for any claims in the bankruptcy case and to submit any Russian government claim to international arbitration. The Russian government seized control of Yukos Bank accounts late last year, and the group?s main asset, Yuganskneftegaz, ended up in the hands of a state-controlled oil company through a disputed auction.

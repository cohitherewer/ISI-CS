 Achilles heel remains, moan footwear firms

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL AND SAMBIT SAHA

Calcutta, Feb. 28: Budget 2005-06 has failed to enthuse the leather industry, even though the finance minister has proposed to reduce the customs duties on specified machinery and ethyl vinyl acetate (EVA) ? an important raw material for the footwear industry.

 For more toehold 

The budget proposes to reduce the customs duties on 

seven specified machinery from 20 per cent to 5 per cent. The duty on ethyl vinyl 

acetate (EVA), an input for the footwear industry, is also proposed to be reduced 

from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.

M. Rafeeque Ahmed, chairman of the Council for Leather 

Exports (CLE), said: ?The leather sector, which has been recognised as a focus 

area in the common minimum programme and in the foreign trade policy has not been 

given corresponding thrust in the budget.?

 He added that the industry had expected a special package of fiscal measures, with a view to encourage investments into this sector, which offers huge potential for growth and employment generation. 

 Any due thrust to this sector would have helped in achieving its target of doubling export to Rs 20,000 crore and creating additional employment to 3 lakh people, besides enhancing income to existing large workforce by 2010.

 The CLE feels that certain policy support measures earlier sought for enhancing competitiveness in leather industry have not been considered in the budget. Some of these are central excise duty exemption on machinery and parts thereof, removal of central excise on footwear and footwear components, CVD exemption on tanning extracts etc.

 However, a section of the industry was upbeat about the budget proposals saying it would boost the footwear industry that required modernisation by way of installing machines to meet the export requirement. From the present level of $800 now, it can go up $2.4 billion in next five years if everything put in place.

 Machinery for leather is mainly imported from Italy. Given the fact that number of new footwear clusters are being developed across the country, the timing just could suit the industry.

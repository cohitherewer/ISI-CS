 TCS swings into action to soothe nerves

 Ramadorai: Clearing the air

 Mumbai, April 20: A day after Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) came out with its annual results, CEO and managing director S. Ramadorai was busy assuaging investor concerns regarding its financial performance in the quarter ended March 2005.

 Ramadorai today fielded questions from the media on the company?s results at a breakfast meeting. He and executive vice-president N. Chandrasekaran met select media persons for the second time today regarding the results.

 ?It is not a shock (the results). We have delivered returns aggregating 1150 per cent (300 per cent for the second quarter, 350 per cent for the third quarter and 500 per cent for the fourth quarter) as dividend and we?ll continue to give the same healthy returns,? Ramadorai said.

 The results confounded the market on Tuesday and the stock continued to slide today. 

 The TCS scrip, which lost 8.37 per cent on the day of the results to close at Rs 1209.75, shed another 7.77 per cent to close at Rs 1115.65.

 Before last year?s IPO, the company had only one investor, namely Tata Sons, as its shareholder. After the public issue, its minority shareholders hold 11 per cent of the Rs 48-crore equity. The company, which has a large array of foreign and local shareholders, therefore, has to explain its performance at every investor forum.

 ?The company?s reporting style on earnings has to be improved,? said a fund manager. Prabhudas Lilladher?s Apoorva Shah, an analyst tracking the IT industry, was more forthcoming. ?TCS is probably the slowest growing company among the top three IT firms,? he said. The other two in the top-three bracket are Infosys Technologies and Wipro. 

 However, the correction for the TCS shares may be over, Shah says and adds that the stock could rebound in the coming days. 

 TCS, unlike its peers, has declined to give an outlook for the coming quarters. ?We?ll not give any guidance,? Ramadorai said. ?There?s a healthy momentum in the business,? he added.

 Shah agreed that TCS is not doing all that badly. After all, it has doubled its turnover and profit in two years. What?s gone badly are the knee-jerk moves to account for employee incentives in the last quarter instead of incorporating it in instalments over four quarters, according to analysts. These are not extraordinary one-time expenses, which will not be incurred again. These expenses will recur, analysts added.

 Meanwhile, TCS is charting its new growth path. On the anvil is a huge complex in Bangalore where it plans to accommodate 1200 people on every floor of the seven-storey building that will have a having a total seating capacity of around 8000.

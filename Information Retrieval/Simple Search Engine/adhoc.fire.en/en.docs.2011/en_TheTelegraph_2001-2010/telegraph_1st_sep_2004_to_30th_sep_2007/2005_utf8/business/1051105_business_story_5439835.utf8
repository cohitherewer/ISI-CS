 Steel kingpins unite to hold back import tide

 SAMBIT SAHA 

 Calcutta, Nov. 4: Stung by a deluge of cheap imports, domestic steel comanies are now gearing up to file an anti-dumping case with the commerce ministry. 

 Members of the Indian Steel Alliance (ISA) ? Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Ispat Industries, Essar, JSW Steel and Rastriya Ispat Nigam (RINL) ? are meeting next week to work out the next course of action. 

 ISA sources said the case could be filed in 7-10 days from now. ISA is likely to file the plea with the commerce ministry. However, individual companies may file cases as well, sources added.

 Steel imports have swollen by 60 per cent in the first six months of this fiscal to touch 1.1 million tonnes, thereby depressing domestic prices. 

 The industry has collated last six months data, which is vital for filing the anti-dumping case. Steel firms have to prove that the free-on-board prices of imported steel is less than the cost of production by the domestic industry. 

 Moreover, there has been a 137 per cent increase in hot-rolled product imports. The exports growth, on the other hand, has fallen 6 per cent. 

 As a result, domestic availability (product available in the market for sale) has shot up by 11.5 per cent compared with an apparent consumption (domestic demand) of 9.4 per cent. 

 There are two ways the companies can establish the anti-dumping case. They have to prove that volume of imported steel is 3 per cent of the market size. On the other hand, they have to establish that the cost of production (including the finance charges and depreciation) is more than the F..B. price of import.

 The most potent argument for Indian players would be prices. Imports are taking place at an average price of $330-370 a tonne. Average cost of production for Essar and Ispat would be between $380-410 a tonne. For SAIL, it is about $ 310 a tonne.

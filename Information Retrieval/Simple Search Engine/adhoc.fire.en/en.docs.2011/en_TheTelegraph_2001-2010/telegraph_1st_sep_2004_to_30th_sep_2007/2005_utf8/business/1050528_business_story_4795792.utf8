 Calcutta, May 27: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) will start commercial production of natural gas from its Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin by April next year, chairman and managing director Subir Raha said.

 The gas will flow at the rate of 2 million standard cubic metres per day from the G-1 and GS-15 fields. This is the countrys first deepwater development programme.

 Raha said the company has also made a few more discoveries in the basin.

 The development programme for these fields are being worked out, he added.

 Described as Indias first digital oil field, the total investment in the project is estimated to be Rs 1,300 crore.

 He said gas production would not be a problem. The support infrastructure will be in place by the time we start producing gas from this field. 

 ONGC is developing five production wells in the deep-sea G-1 field. It is located 28 km offshore, in depths between 135 m and 500 m. 

 On the other hand, development of GS-15, a shallow-water field lying five kilometres offshore, has been integrated in the project. 

 During the peak production period, two fields are expected to produce around 9,400 barrels of crude per day and 2.7 mmscmd of gas. 

 ONGC has made a major discovery earlier this year in deep water with reserves of 3 billion cubic feet. It has also made many smaller discoveries in shallow waters in the Krishna-Godavari basin before.

 Iran LNG bid

 Raha said ONGC has in-principle decided to look into an LNG development project in Iran. Petronas of Malaysia is believed to have expressed its desire to exit from the project. If this is the case, we will look into the project, Raha said.

 Petronas holds about 20 per cent stake in the $2-billion project. The other companies include Total of France and National Iranian Oil Company.

 Petrochem foray

 ONGC will soon engage a consultant to carry out a feasibility study for its diversification in the petrochemicals sector, Raha said.

 He also mentioned that for the c2 and c3 extraction plants at Dahej, the company had already appointed a consultant to prepare the detailed feasibility report.

 After the report was submitted, ONGC would appoint a project management consultant followed by a contractor to execute the project.

 Sunderban project

 Raha expressed satisfaction at the on-going exploration in the Sunderban offshore block. The company has drilled up to a depth of 3,000 metres compared with a target of 5,000 metres.

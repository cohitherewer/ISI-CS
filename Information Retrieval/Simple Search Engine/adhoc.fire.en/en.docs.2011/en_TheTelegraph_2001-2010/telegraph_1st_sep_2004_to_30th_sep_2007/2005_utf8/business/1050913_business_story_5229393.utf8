 Nokia shortlists two sites for base

 Helsinki, Sept. 12 (PTI): Nokia has zeroed in on two sites in India for its global network operations centre that will manage the networks of mobile service providers across the globe.

 We have zeroed in on two sites for our global network operations centre. We will soon announce the site, Nokia executive vice-president and general manager networks Simon Beresford-Wyile said.

 Nokia is offering managed services to 34 of its 140 clients in 28 countries, and has provided operating services for over 20 operators globally, helping them with the day-to-day tasks of running their networks so that they can focus on bolstering their business offerings.

 The network operations centre will centralise the delivery of network management and operating services for Nokia, he said. It will be operational in the first half of 2006 and employ 100 people initially, Beresford-Wyile said, adding it would be the only one of its kind in the world.

 He said the company is talking to its clients in managed services business for delivering these services from India. Services business comprises 25 per cent of Nokias revenues from network business and accounts for one-third of the employees.

 The company had signed a $125-million deal last month with Bharti to expand its managed GSM/GPRS/EDGE networks in eight circles in western, central and eastern India.

 Beresford-Wyile said Nokia is gradually moving from being a manufacturing to a services company.

 Business in services was beginning to mature. Going forward, Nokia would be more a software and services company and revenues from services in networks business will grow to 50 per cent of the total in the next 3-5 years, he said.

 Nokia networks services business unit consists of systems integration, care-learning solutions, operations solutions, managed services and delivery services (in delivery operations).

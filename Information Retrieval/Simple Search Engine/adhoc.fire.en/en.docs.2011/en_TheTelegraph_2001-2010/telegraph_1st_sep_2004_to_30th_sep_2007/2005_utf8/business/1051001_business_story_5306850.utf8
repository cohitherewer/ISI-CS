 Daimler stake whispers around VW

 In the news

 Frankfurt, Sept. 30 (Reuters): German carmaker DaimlerChrysler wants to buy a stake of around 20 per cent in Volkswagen, German magazine Focus reported on Friday, citing supervisory board sources. 

 A board source at Daimler, however, told Reuters that there were no plans to buy a stake, while its commercial vehicles chief, Andreas Renschler, called the report pure speculation. 

 Volkswagen declined to comment on the report. 

 According to Focus, outgoing chief executive Juergen Schrempp was in favour of the idea but wanted to leave the final decision to designated successor Dieter Zetsche. He in turn wanted to complete the deal by February or March next year. 

 The magazine said talks were already at an advanced stage. 

 The Focus report comes on the heels of Sundays news that German luxury carmaker Porsche aimed to buy a 20 per cent stake in VW to prevent a hostile takeover that could threaten the two carmakers business ties. 

 Focus wrote that there was discussion of a cross-holding between the companies, with VW buying a stake in DaimlerChrysler. 

 However, a member of the supervisory board at Daimler, speaking on condition of anonymity, denied there was any plan to buy a stake in VW or to swap shareholdings. 

 Speaking in Papenburg, Germany, during an event with reporters, Renschler said: We work and talk with them very often, anything over and above this is pure speculation. 

 A spokeswoman for Daimler would not comment on whether there were plans to acquire a stake in VW, but said Europes largest carmaker had approached Daimler over such a deal. 

 Volkswagen has raised the subject many times in the past and it never led to a result, she said. 

 Shares in Daimler fell 1.3 per cent to 43.92 euros by 1019, underperforming slight declines in the DJ Stoxx European autos index. VW shares rose 0.6 per cent to 50.61 euros. 

 The probability of Daimler buying a stake in VW has probably sunk after Porsche said it would acquire one, said Bankhaus Sal Oppenheim analyst Michael Raab. 

 There are some areas like research and development where it makes sense to partner up and split the cost, he continued, citing hybrid collaborations between VW and Porsche on the one hand and Daimler, BMW and GM on the other.

 The question is whether one needs to buy a stake to accomplish this. I would prefer contractual partnerships, Raab said.

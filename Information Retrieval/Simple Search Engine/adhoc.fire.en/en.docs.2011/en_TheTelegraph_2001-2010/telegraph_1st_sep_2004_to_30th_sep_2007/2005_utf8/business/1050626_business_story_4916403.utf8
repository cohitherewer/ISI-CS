 Govt to bail out Punjab amp; Sind Bank

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 25: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today assured the Punjab amp; Sind Bank that the government would pump in fresh funds to bail it out of the current financial crisis. The management of the ailing bank is reported to have sought a Rs 600-crore package from the government in order to turn around its operations. 

 However, the finance minister said the bank should draw up an action plan for mobilising more deposits and recovering its loans.

 I am confident we can turn around the bank in 2-3 years as we have turned around five banks since 1996-97, Chidambaram told reporters after a meeting with senior officials of the bank.

 The finance minister said there were only three ways of raising resources ? mobilising more deposits, recovery of more loans and infusing more capital to help the bank grow. He said the bank management has promised him it would mobilise more deposits and improve recovery. The finance minister told the bank officials that they should aim for a 12-15 per cent growth in its credit portfolio.

 Then I will, in turn, infuse more capital...We will sympathetically consider the banks request for infusing more capital, the finance minister said. The bank must win the confidence of customers, he added.

 The customers of the Punjab amp; Sind Bank also should continue to repose confidence and faith in the bank, he pointed out.

 We will have a grant centenary celebrations on June 24, 2008, the minister said and urged all the officers, employees to work towards turning around the bank.

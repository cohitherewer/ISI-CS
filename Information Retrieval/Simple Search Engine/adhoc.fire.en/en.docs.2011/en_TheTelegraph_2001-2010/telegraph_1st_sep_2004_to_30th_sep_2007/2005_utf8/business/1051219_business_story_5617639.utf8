 Open-n-shut case

 Confused about ELSS? Srikumar Banerjee builds a case for close-ended funds

 Open or closed? New or old? Repurchase, flexibility, liquidity, redemption pressure. Confused, right? As an investor, you cannot be blamed. And the government is not making things any simpler by coming out with conflicting notifications.

 You just want to know how to invest your money prudently, intelligently and gainfully. Fund managers swear by diversity in a portfolio, and being keen to save on taxes, you decide to go for an equity-linked savings scheme (ELSS).

 This way, you get to invest in the market and also get tax benefits under section 80c. Nothing could be better. 

 But then comes the Central Board of Direct Taxes with a notification that the new equity-linked savings schemes would have to be 10-year close-ended funds with a three-year lock-in to avail of the tax deduction under section 80c. 

 The schemes can open for repurchase after one year from the allotment of the units for at least three months in a year. After the first three years, the repurchase would have to be done by the fund house at least once every month.

 However, on December 13, the board clarified that investments made on or after April 1, 2005, in plans issued in accordance with ELSS 1992/1998 and ELSS 2005 are eligible for income tax deductions under section 80c of the Income Tax Act. 

 So where does that leave investors and mutual funds, you ask. The board did not clarify if the new schemes have to be close-ended as the original notification stated or if they could be open-ended.

 So the question is whether it?s a good idea to have close-ended funds in the portfolio. For that we need to know how the two funds compare. 

 How they compare

 Investors of an open-ended fund can buy or sell their units based on the net asset value (per unit) of the scheme directly to the mutual fund house any number of times.

 In close-ended funds, however, investors can buy the units directly from the mutual fund only during the limited new-fund offer period. Besides, close-ended schemes, as the name suggests, have a fixed maturity period. 

 After the new-fund offer, the units can be bought and sold like shares from the secondary market, provided the mutual fund in question lists its scheme on the bourses. 

 The exit from close-ended funds is highly restricted. Investors can sell their units directly to the mutual fund at the current NAV as and when the fund house announces a repurchase, and, unlike an open-ended scheme, the repurchase may be just once or twice a year. 

 Again, the units of close-ended schemes are traded at a discount to their net asset value and the difference between the price and the NAV narrows down as the scheme approaches its maturity. 

 Old-time favourite 

 Canny investors pick close-ended schemes that have a strong investment portfolio of fundamentally sound companies and are selling at a fair discount. They sell the same at a profit on maturity when the market price equals the NAV. 

 Unfortunately, only one Morgan Stanley scheme out of a total of 56 close-ended funds is listed and traded on domestic bourses.

 Close-ended funds, popular in the pre-liberalisation days, died out by the late 1990s. Open-ended funds, with their easy liquidity, caught the fancy of investors. 

 However, close-ended funds are making a come-back. Fixed-term income schemes by mutual funds have received good responses, even though they no longer offer assured returns. Statistics available with the Association of Mutual Funds of India show that 42 out of 56 close-ended funds till November end this year are income funds. 

 Fixed-term income funds are popular among seasoned investors because they provide a good hedge and return against volatility. 

 Being close-ended, there is no redemption pressure and fund managers can play with a stable corpus and invest in stocks with a long-term perspective, giving investors handsome returns. 

 In fact, the same reason was put forward when a three-year lock-in period was announced for ELSS when they were allowed to become open-ended in 1998-99. 

 What?s ailing them?

 However, if we compare funds in the same category and even the same mutual fund house, the returns (as reflected in the NAVs) of close-ended schemes lag behind open-ended schemes. 

 So why are the returns in close-ended funds lower? The reason could be the casual approach of fund managers. Impassionate investors, on their part, have switched over to open-ended funds lured by the liquidity and then began to float from one fund to another in quick churns without gaining much in the process. 

 The very purpose of allowing ELSS to become open-ended, which was to draw small investors to mutual funds, has been defeated as the asset under management of all ELSS ? closed and open-ended ? is a mere 2 per cent of Rs 2,04,519 crore AUM of the mutual fund industry. 

 However, close-ended funds, despite their limited flexibility, can be as remunerative as open-ended schemes. In fact, investors should consider keeping close-ended funds in their portfolio as a well-managed fund can give a better return than an open-ended fund. Fixed-term income plans and small-scale sector funds are some categories where close-ended funds are a better option than an open-ended one. 

 In ELSS too, a close-ended fund with a more frequent repurchase facility, as suggested by the CBDT, can prove good in the long-term. 

 What is also needed is an interval fund ? a combination of benefits of stable capital corpus of close-ended funds and the liquidity of open-ended funds.

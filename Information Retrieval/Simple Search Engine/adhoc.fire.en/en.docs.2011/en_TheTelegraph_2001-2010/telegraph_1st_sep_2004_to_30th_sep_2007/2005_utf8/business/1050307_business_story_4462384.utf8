 Jindal Power ties up cash for new unit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 6: Jindal Power Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jindal Steel and Power, is likely to attain financial closure for the second phase of its 1000-MW power project at Raigarh by the month-end.

 The financial closure for the first phase was attained last year. The total project cost of the 500-MW second phase is Rs 2,142 crore, of which the equity component, to be funded by Jindal Steel, is Rs 642 crore and the debt portion is Rs 1,500 crore.

 According to Jindal Power director Sushil K. Maroo, the company is in the process of signing loan agreements from a clutch of lenders. These include Power Finance Corporation, State Bank of India, Central Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Hyderabad and Union Bank of India. 

 Maroo said while the project will be completed by 2007-08, the company is moving fast with its implementation. For instance, Jindal Power had already paid an advance to Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd for supply of boiler turbine generator packages for the first as well as the second phase of the power project.

 He also said after being commissioned, Jindal Power will be a major private sector power generating company, ranked only after Tata Power Company. ?We will not only be a major power generating company, but as the project has its own coal mines, it will provide power at a low tariff,? Maroo added.

 He did not rule out the possibility of Jindal Power entering the capital markets through an IPO. A part of the power capacity generated by Jindal Power will be used by Jindal Steel and the balance sold in the market.

 Calcutta, June 20: In a bid to strengthen the loan taking capabilities of small and medium scale industries (SME), Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) in collaboration with major banks and credit rating agencies plans to set up an SME-dedicated credit rating agency.

 We are in the process of tying up with a couple of major credit rating agencies, and banks are currently holding discussions with them. The SME rating agency will be formed in the next few months, said N. K. Maini, chief general manager, Sidbi. He was talking at a seminar on Schemes for Promotion of Small Scale Industry, organised by Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

 Maini explained that since the banks would be partners in the initiative, the acceptability of such ratings, done by the dedicated agency, shall be much higher. This will definitely aid the enterprises in the small and medium sectors to get both term loans and working capital at more attractive and competitive rates, he added.

 The other important aspect of the initiative undertaken by Sidbi is the strategic alliance with major banks to leverage on the strength of each entity.

 Towards that end, we have already tied up with Bank of India and well also associate with Uco Bank shortly, said Maini.

 Sidbi has financed projects worth Rs 2,800 crore from its Rs 10,000-crore SME Fund. The bank expects that financing of projects will be done at a higher pace during the current year, mentioned Maini.

 Also, as part of its venture capital financing, the institution has introduced a Rs 500-crore growth venture fund for the knowledge and sunrise industries.

 Under its micro finance scheme, Sidbi had financed projects worth Rs 200 crore last year. It expects to upscale that figure to Rs 450 crore this year.

 As on May 31, the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Small Industries (CGTSI) has provided guarantee worth Rs 581 crore to 32 money lending institutions to provide collateral-free loans to 29,124 projects in the small and medium sectors, pointed out S. L. Choudhury, chief executive officer, CGTSI.

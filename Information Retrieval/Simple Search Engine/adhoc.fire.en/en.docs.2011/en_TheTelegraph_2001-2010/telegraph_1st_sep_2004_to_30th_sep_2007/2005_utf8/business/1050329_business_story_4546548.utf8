 Trade sheen in new gold policy

 New Delhi, March 28: The government will announce a comprehensive, liberalised and user-friendly gold policy next month, commerce secretary S. N. Menon said here today.

 The policy is likely to help mutual funds and banks invest in gold and hedge in the commodity futures market. 

 This is a significant step in developing the domestic gold market, which was opened up in a limited way in 2003.

 During his meeting with the gold committee members of the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham), Menon said the new policy will be announced separately and not as a part of one on foreign trade.

 The six-member delegation also discussed issues like improving the ability of banks to implement the gold-linked savings scheme. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram had announced in the budget that he would be asking the market regulator to permit, in consultation with the RBI, mutual funds to introduce gold exchange traded funds with the precious metal as the underlying asset. This will enable any person to buy and sell gold in units as low as Rs 100. Such units could be traded in the same manner as mutual funds.

 India is the world?s largest user of gold and silver. It utilises 800 tonnes of gold annually, or about a third of the total supply mined in the world. The country has private hoards of 13,000 tonnes of gold. India allowed futures trading in both gold and silver in 2003, after more than four decades.

 It had banned futures in gold in 1962, after the Indo-China war, because of the loss of reserves. The National Multi Commodity Exchange of India gives bullion traders the option of hedging the risks arising from price fluctuations. This will now be extended to banks and mutual funds.

 Other measures discussed in the meeting were the need for policy measures to develop India as a global hub for bullion trade, establishment of gold as a reliable investment product and use of retail bullion reserves in the country.

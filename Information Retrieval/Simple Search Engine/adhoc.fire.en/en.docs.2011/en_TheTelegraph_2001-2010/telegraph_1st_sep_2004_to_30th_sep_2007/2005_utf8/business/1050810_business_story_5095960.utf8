 Broadband rates take a tumble 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi Aug. 9: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) today cut the broadband charges for its DataOne services by 50 per cent. Network service provider Hughes has also slashed its satellite broadband prices by 40 per cent and introduced five high-speed service plans.

 DataOne home plan users with 256 kbps connections will have to pay Rs 250 per month instead of Rs 500 per month. However, the download/upload limit will be 400 mega bits per second (mbps) instead of 1 giga bit per second (gbps). 

 BSNL has also introduced a new DataOne business plan with an entry-level tariff of Rs 700 for a 256 kbps connection, which is lower than the existing Rs 1200 plan for business users. The plan offers a free upload/download limit of 2 gbps.

 The new tariff is an Independence Day offer from BSNL and will be applicable from midnight of August 15. 

 There will be no security deposit for the Home 250 and Home 500 plans. BSNL has also waived all installation charges till September 30. The company will offer all DataOne home plan users (excluding the Home 250 plan) unlimited night downloading facilities from 8 pm to 8 am.

 Billing of DataOne will be on a monthly basis after usage from now. One-time modem charges have been reduced from the current Rs 2000 to Rs 1200 for type-I modems. 

 Hughes is a premier network service provider in India servicing enterprise business, governments and consumers. It offers services under DirecWay Enterprise Broadband. The new service plans will enable organisations to select a plan that meets their business requirements as they scale up the enterprise applications or number of users. 

 The plans, namely Enterprise 500, 400, 300, 200 and 100, are priced between Rs 2,000 and Rs 10,000. The will deliver up to 1 mbps of downstream and upstream speeds and will prove useful for banking, insurance and e-governance sectors. These plans will be operational from August 20.

 Hughes India senior vice-president Amit Tripathi said, Our endeavour is to offer state-of-the-art and cost-effective enterprise connectivity solutions to our customers. Today we are raising the bar further by introducing bandwidth prices that are 40 per cent lower than the exiting market rates.

Installation of hot spots is already under way at various cities. Hot spots can be at airports, railway stations and universities.

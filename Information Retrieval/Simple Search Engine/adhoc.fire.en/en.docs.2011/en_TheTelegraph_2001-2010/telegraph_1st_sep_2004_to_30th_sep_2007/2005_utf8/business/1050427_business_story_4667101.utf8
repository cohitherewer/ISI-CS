 McKinsey digs out east?s metal potential 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 26: The minerals and metals sectors in eastern India have the potential to attract investment worth $75-120 billion over the next 10-12 years, a CII-McKinsey study said today.

 The report named ?Turning the Metals and Mining Potential of Eastern India into a Goldmine? focused on three key minerals, iron ore (steel) coal and bauxite (alumina and aluminium). 

 According to the report, which was formally unveiled by West Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at a CII international conference on ?Minerals-Metals-Manufacturing? here today, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Orissa could aspire to produce 130-195 million tonnes (MT) of iron ore, 56-78 MT of steel, 500-670 mt of coal, 6-8.5 MT of alumina and 2.5-3.5 MT of aluminium.

 West Bengal could aspire to produce 80-100 MT of coal and expand its current steel capacity. This will significantly increase the current economic growth rates of these states resulting in Chhattisgarh growing at 5.5 per cent, Jharkhand at 5.9 per cent and Orissa 7.1 per cent.

 However, these will remain a pipedream if corrective measures are not taken now to remove the hurdles for this development.

 The McKinsey report pointed out that priority status should be accorded to the minerals and metals sector. 

 It said project approvals should be expedited through single window clearances by setting up of special mining zones and amending the forest conservation act. 

 It talked about developing dedicated infrastructure through public-private partnership. 

 It also suggested the deregulation of the coal sector for greater private participation and globally competitive prices. Moreover, the McKinsey report also mooted the idea to transform the eastern region into a power hub.

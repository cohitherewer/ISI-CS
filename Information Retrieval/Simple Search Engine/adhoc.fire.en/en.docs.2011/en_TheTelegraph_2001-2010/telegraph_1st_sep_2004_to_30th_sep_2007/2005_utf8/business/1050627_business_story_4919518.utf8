The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Problem of plenty

 Competition spawns choices: 

 the insurance industry today best exemplifies this. 

 But there?s a danger of having a bewildering array 

 of options: the problem hit the telecom industry 

 some years ago, forcing the regulator to cap the 

 number of options that companies could offer mobile 

 newbies. 

 There are first signs 

 of trouble in the insurance industry today where 

 aggressive private players have started loading 

 ?riders? onto basic plans and have started selling 

 them with catchy slogans and smart marketing strategies. 

 The flip side of all this is that 

 the riders cost money. So, when you cut through the thicket 

 of add-ons on your insurance policy, you could find to your 

 dismay that the same sum assured on one policy could mean 

 a higher premium fork-out than another plain vanilla plan 

 (see table).

 This brings us to the nut cracker 

 question: can you cut through the sales patter and pick 

 up the add-ons that you want in your insurance policy? And 

 can you intelligently bargain hunt for the premium that 

 you wish to pay instead of being conned into paying a higher 

 sum by a glib-talking insurance adviser? 

 The answer is both yes and no. 

 The premium is determined by mortality cost, expected surplus 

 that can be generated by the insurer by investing the premium 

 kitty, and the insurer?s various expenses.

 While all insurance companies 

 in India refer to the Life Insurance Corporation?s 1994-96 

 assured lives mortality table as the basis for calculating 

 the mortality charge, they differ widely on the two other 

 counts ? expected surplus and expenses. 

 An insurer?s mortality table takes 

 into account only the lives it has assured, while a general 

 population mortality table covers both the assured and non-assured 

 (which include the poor) lives. 

 An insurers mortality table 

 is its experience with death claims per thousand people 

 insured corresponding to different age-groups, locations 

 and so on. 

 The mortality of an age group 

 helps an insurer calculate its risk in insuring a person 

 in that age group. On that basis, the insurer charges a 

 mortality fee. For example, the mortality rate for the non-smoker, 

 urban male age group of 30-32 to survive till the age of 

 50 is 1.46. Then the insurers risk to cover the policyholder 

 is 1.46 per cent, which it includes in the premium rate 

 as mortality cost. 

 ?Mortality charge is one of the 

 many components that determine a premium rate. Moreover, 

 the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) 

 has allowed insurers to modify the basic table justified 

 with their experience with death claims. So, an insurer 

 can charge a higher mortality fee, and hence a higher premium,? 

 said an actuary officer in LIC. 

 The premiums collected by an insurer 

 are invested in capital markets in a fixed pattern outlined 

 by the IRDA. Out of the surplus earned on the premiums invested, 

 95 per cent is distributed to the policyholders and the 

 balance 5 per cent to shareholders and meeting expenses. 

 An insurer would charge a higher premium if it expects to 

 earn more surplus income from its investment.

 Then there are commission to agents, 

 office expenses, advertising and salaries, which the company 

 manages from the 5 per cent surplus earning. If the expenses 

 are high, it has to collect more premiums.

 But, a low-cost option is not 

 always good economics. Like any other financial instrument, 

 the merit of a life insurance policy should be judged by 

 comparing its cost-benefit with that of peer products. 

 ?The premium rate of a life insurer 

 depends on how it provides for its profit margins, benefits 

 such as loyalty additions or terminal bonus to policyholders, 

 infrastructure expenses, distribution network and reinsurance 

 cost,? said the LIC official. 

 An insurer can, however, maintain 

 a low premium rate provided the average sum assured per 

 policy with the insurance company is high. If the sum assured 

 of a policy is high, the premium amount will be steep and 

 the insurer need not charge a high rate to generate a great 

 investible kitty. The available data reveals that average 

 policy sum assured for most of the private insurers are 

 larger than that of LIC. 

 Besides, the private insurers? 

 distribution and sales expenses are also low as they are 

 operating in select segments. ?But many private insurers 

 charge a higher premium rate because they want to make more 

 profit and give higher returns to their shareholders, quot; 

 explained a marketing manager of a private sector life insurance 

 company. 

 An effective way to judge which 

 insurer offers the best deal is to compare the ratio of 

 expected guaranteed additions, terminal bonus, reversionary 

 bonus, and loyalty benefits on policy maturity to total 

 premium cost for different insurers.

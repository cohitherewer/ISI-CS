 Calcutta, July 22: The Bengal government today kicked off the first phase of the proposed polypark, which will be set up on 65 acres near the food park at Sankrail in Howrah. West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) today signed an agreement with the Indian Plastic Federation to set up the polypark. 

 Nirupam Sen, the state commerce and industry minister who was present at the signing ceremony, said, It is a unique project and will generate employment for a good number of people. 

 The first phase development of the polypark, entailing an investment of about Rs 155 crore, will cover an area of 50 acres and will house 36 units. These units will produce woven sacks fabric, film, pouches, bags, flexible packaging laminates, extrusion items, injection and blow moulded items.

 The initial cost for developing the infrastructure at the park has been pegged at Rs 16 crore. IPF today signed a cheque Rs 1.67 crore, almost 10 per cent of the project cost.

 WBIDC has already procured 42 acres of land directly from the owners. 

 The corporation will sell the land at the rate of Rs 33.5 lakh per acre. Land will be allotted in favour of the industrial units by the end of 2005 and the infrastructure facilities will be up in another years times.

 About 10,000 people are expected to get direct employment once the park is ready and another 19,000 will be employed indirectly.

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: Union communications minister Dayanidhi Maran today asked the telecom regulator to break the cartel of operators in the international long distance services to bring down the cost of overseas calls. 

 He said if the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India is unable to take strict actions against the cartel ? Bharti, Videsh Sanchar Nigam and Reliance Infocomm (the ILD operators in India) ? the government would examine other methods. 

 I am against the cartel. These operators do not want competition to come in because it will lower the cost for the end consumer. Hence, they are against the governments proposal to bring down the entry fee for ILD operators and are demanding a compensation, Maran said at the annual conference of Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association of India. He refused to elaborate about the possible government action. 

 Maran said telecom equipment manufacturers like Nokia have not focused on entry-level customers, which the Indian equipment manufacturers can take up as a challenge. 

 He advocated an Indian Telephone with more than 90 per cent Indian component. But manufacturers should retain quality, while producing such low-cost phones, he added. 

 Nokia, I am sorry to say, is still out of reach for many and it can bring down the price. Motorola has promised to launch a sub-$30 mobile phone, but there is scope for lowering the cost further, Maran said. 

 He also highlighted the need for a chip fabrication unit in India so that mobile phone manufacturers are not required to import. This will lower the cost of handsets. 

 A chip is a vital component in a mobile phone that performs various activities with the help of embedded software. 

 Commenting on BSNLs order for 60 million mobile phones and equipment for telecom infrastructure, Maran said, This tender will set a precedent. It will be an open tender. So anyone can participate. But the bidder has to ensure that 30 per cent of value addition is done within the country.

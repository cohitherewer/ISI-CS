 BSNL in Bengal fixed-line scramble

 Phone fortune

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) will install 1.5 lakh fixed-line phones in Bengal in the current financial year. 

 This will wipe out the total waiting list of 1.38 lakh phones in the state.

 The special thrust to increase the number of landline connections in Bengal will be part of the government?s mandate to BSNL for doubling the national network by 2007. Communications minister Dayanidhi Maran has set a target to raise the country?s tele-density from the present 10 lines per 100 people to 22.

 As part of the programme, BSNL has set its own target to raise its tele-density share of 5 per 100 people (mobile and landline combined) to 11. 

 At a recent meeting of the communications ministry and BSNL officials, BSNL chairman and managing director A.K. Sinha said, ?The mobile phones based on the global system for mobile communications (GSM) technology will have a major share in this expansion plan. It also gives us an opportunity to further expand our landline networks in Bengal.?

 ?We plan to add over 1.5 lakh landlines and 7 lakh GSM mobile connections during the current financial year to the network in the state. The total number of BSNL GSM connections is expected to be over 26 lakh by 2007 from 3.57 lakh now,? said Sinha.

 Sinha said BSNL plans to set up about 4,820 broadband connections and WiFi (wireless networks to cover a minimum of 100-200 meters in hotels, airports and shopping malls) hot spots at Bagdogra. The expansion will result in BSNL coverage to all the tehsil headquarters in Bengal. 

 ?Currently we cover 58 of the 64 tehsil headquarters in the state. The total number of cities and towns to be covered will go up by another 316 from the present 144,? said Sinha.

 The rail route coverage of BSNL?s mobile network will go up by another 250 km adding to the existing coverage of 191 km. The state highway connectivity is proposed to be increased to cover another 487 km from the existing 1231 km. 

 Under BSNL?s expansion plans, the Internet connections are also likely to go up to 1.2 lakh by 2007 and all villages will have access to the Internet. The capacity for broadband connections in the state will be over 60,000 by 2007 and bandwidth availability will be on demand.

 Nearly 18,000 km of optical fibre cable connects 1900 BSNL exchanges in Bengal, including the Calcutta metro. All block headquarters have digital connectivity, which will be extended to villages.

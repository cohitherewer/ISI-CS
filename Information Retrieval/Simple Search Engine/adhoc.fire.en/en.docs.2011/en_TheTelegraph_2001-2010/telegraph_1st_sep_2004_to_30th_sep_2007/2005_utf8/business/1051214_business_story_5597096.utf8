 Eight-nation team lead from front

 S.P.S. PANNU

 Hong Kong Dec. 13: India today teamed up with Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, Namibia, Egypt, Indonesia and the Philippines to ensure that the developing nations have to make less concessions at the ongoing trade negotiations. 

 The eight nations jointly wrote to John Tsang, the chairman of the sixth WTO ministerial, saying that the draft ministerial declaration did not adequately reflect the concerns of the developing countries on non-agricultural market access (NAMA). They have also formed the core group on NAMA. 

 The letter has pointed out that the principles laid out in the two crucial papers Flexibilities for Developing Countries and Reclaiming Development in the WTO Doha Development Round, which were submitted by the developing countries, have not been adequately incorporated.

 It said the principle of less than full reciprocity and special and differential treatment for developing countries and least developed countries were agreed to in the Doha mandate and remained central to NAMA negotiations.

 Less than full reciprocity means developing countries would have proportionately lower reduction commitments than developed nations like the US and EU. 

 The rationale behind this is developing countries should make lesser commitments for reducing tariffs than the developed countries. Also, the commitments must allow framing of necessary policies for carrying forward the development strategies.

 The letter has also made a strong case for retaining the special and differential treatment of products of developing countries as a stand-alone clause in NAMA and not linking it with the Swiss formula or other elements.

 Although the developed countries are highly competitive in the industrial sector, they continue to maintain high tariff barriers for products that developing countries are keen to export, the letter said.

 The unequivocal removal of these tariff barriers is at the core of the Doha mandate. In addition, there are a large number of non-tariff barriers and abuse of trade remedial measures, which need to be addressed, it added.

 It has pointed out that most developing countries continue to reform and industrialise their economies. 

 Reforms have included substantial autonomous tariff liberalisation whereby real market access has already been granted.

 Yet a number of sensitive sectors still exist in almost all developing countries, given their labour intensive nature, revenue implications and contribution to employment.

 The letter highlights the fact that these sectors have to be carefully managed using the same policy tools that were available to the developed countries at similar levels of development.

 Left plan to douse oil price fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Yechury: Common concern

 New Delhi, April 26: The Left today came out strongly against the government?s move to raise the prices of petroleum products and presented a three-point formula to shield the ?common man from the impact of soaring international prices of oil.

 CPM leaders Sitaram Yechury and Dipankar Mukherjee told petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar that, ?The burden of rising international prices should not be passed on to the common man.? 

 They suggested that the additional 50 paise per litre cess on petrol and diesel should be shelved, the levy for the oil industry development fund should be scrapped, and excise duties reworked in order to enable the oil companies to cushion consumers from the price hike. 

 Briefing journalists after the hour-long meeting with the petroleum minister, Yechury said, ?If these three suggestions were accepted, the government could avoid going in for a fresh round of price increases.?

 He said they had it made it very clear that the Left was opposed to any increase in the hike in petroleum products. 

 Yechury said while there was a need to impose the 50 paise cess on petrol and diesel to develop the country?s road infrastructure, the move could be shelved until international prices of oil came down to more stable levels. 

 Given the high level of international prices, this was not the right time to impose this cess as it would increase the burden on the common man, he added. Putting the cess on hold would result in a savings of Rs 3, 000 crore for the oil companies as the cess introduced in the budget has not been passed on to the consumer as yet. 

 The cess imposed for collecting funds for the Oil Industry Development Board amounts to Rs 5,400 crore every year and is not actually handed over to oil industry. If this cess is dispensed with, it would provide a further cushion for the oil companies to bear the burden of the increase in international prices. 

 Yechury said part of the burden of rising international prices should be borne by the finance ministry as well. The suggestion for reworking excise duties on specific rates instead of the ad valorem structure would result in easing the burden of the oil companies and the consumers. 

 Under the system of ad valorem duties, the excise duty that has to be paid goes up proportionately with the prices and serves as a double whammy for the consumers and oil companies.

 A specific duty structure would be a fixed amount to be collected on the quantity of goods produced. 

 The petroleum minister said he would present the views of the Left both to the Prime Minister and the finance minister so that they could be taken into consideration while deciding the price issue.

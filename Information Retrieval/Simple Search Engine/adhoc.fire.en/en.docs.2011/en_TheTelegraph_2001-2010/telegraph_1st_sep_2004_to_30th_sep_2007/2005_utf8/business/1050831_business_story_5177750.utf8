 Calcutta, Aug. 30: The RPG group plans to sell its idle properties across the country to augment cash flows.

 Spencers?, the group?s retail outfit, has some vacant land in Chennai. Similarly, other group companies like Ceat Tyres, KEC International, Saregama and others have surplus and idle assets like flats, land and offices, which will generate cash for the company.

 Talking to reporters on the sidelines of the annual general meeting of Saregama India Limited, vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said, ?We are in the process of identifying the properties. We cannot say what amount of money we expect to garner from their sale. The study to identify the assets is on.?

 Goenka also unveiled the business plan for Saregama.

 Saregama is conducting a study on non-music content-related business. The study will be completed within the next two months.

 ?It may be a TV software, publishing and others. We cannot say what it will be unless the study is over,? Goenka added. 

 Saregama plans to focus on three to four initiatives for growth.

 Films and music would continue to be the main focus areas for the company for greater revenue generation.

 The company is planning to install a master server, which will help to download music at a nominal price.

 ?This will help curb piracy, which can be curbed by keeping the price very low. We have done 35 per cent of it and expect to complete the work by the year-end,? he added.

 Songs of competing companies would be added later as it would be a separate revenue-generating stream.

 Saregama has also decided to produce eight films over the next two to three years, of which two would be in English, one in Bengali and the rest in Hindi.

 The company has also decided to collect royalty from television channels. The total estimated music in royalty amounted to Rs 120 crore which was not collected efficiently by the music industry.

 The company will also focus on the home video segment.

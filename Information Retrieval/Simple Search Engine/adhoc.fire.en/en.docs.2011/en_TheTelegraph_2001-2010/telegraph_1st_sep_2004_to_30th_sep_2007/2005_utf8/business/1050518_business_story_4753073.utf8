 Concern over impact of oil spiral 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 17: India has been spooked for over a year by rising crude oil prices; now theres a study that paints a scary scenario over its long-term impact on the Indian economy and local businesses.

 If crude prices hover around $50 a barrel (as they are doing currently), then it could knock 0.4 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and spur inflation by 1.5 per cent this fiscal, said a study prepared by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci). The growth in the manufacturing sector would also go down by 2.1 percentage points, the study added.

 It gets even scarier if crude oil prices jump to $80 a barrel ? a forecast that has been made by several Cassandras. Such a scenario will leave GDP growth poorer by 4.9 per cent and send inflation surging to 7.9 per cent. In such a situation, growth in the manufacturing sector will tumble by 24.5 percentage points.

 The study suggests that a double-digit increase in oil prices would largely impact manufacturing sectors, including chemicals, transport, textile products, metals and minerals.

 The overall impact could be slightly higher as the study estimates the direct impact of high oil prices on output and does not capture the indirect impact on consumption spending as well as the overall demand conditions.

 However, Indias comfortable position in balance of payment, large foreign exchange reserves and easy access to international capital has helped the government face the current crisis.

 In comparison to previous years, these parameters have substantially improved in Indias favour. Ficcis estimates on the impact of high oil prices is based on a reworking of the intensity levels in India and other major economies.

 Studies conducted earlier have shown that oil intensity (the ratio of oil consumer per unit of the GDP) in India was almost three times higher than that of the OECD countries. In China, it was a little higher than twice the oil intensity of the OECD nations. Domestic oil prices have registered a double digit growth for two or more consecutive years over the last 22 years.

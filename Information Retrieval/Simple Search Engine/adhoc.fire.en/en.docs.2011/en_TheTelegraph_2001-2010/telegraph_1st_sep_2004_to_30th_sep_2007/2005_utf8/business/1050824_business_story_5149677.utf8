 Calcutta, Aug. 23: LG Electronics India expects the GSM handset business to grow to $2 billion by 2010 with equal contributions from domestic and export markets.

 The Korean company had sold 20,000 handsets in 2003, and a whopping 400,000 units in the following year. This year, it expects to sell around 800,000 handsets, of which 560,000 units will be colour phones and 240,000 camera phones.

 The camera-phone segment is expected to see a 600 per cent growth, said H.S. Bhatia, product group head of LGs GSM division. From a 12?15 per cent market share last year, we plan to take 18 per cent of the camera phone and 10 per cent of the colour phone markets.

 The GSM phone business will contribute 20 per cent to LGs targeted sales of $10 billion by 2010. The company will invest $250 million in India over the next five years.

 Bhatia added that India-made phones would be rolled out by 2006. The plant near Pune is likely to be operational in the next three to four months. It has been set up at an investment of $35 million and will produce 20 million handsets by 2010.

 We will produce all models of mobile phones in India. The plant will also cater to Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Africa and West Asia, Bhatia said.

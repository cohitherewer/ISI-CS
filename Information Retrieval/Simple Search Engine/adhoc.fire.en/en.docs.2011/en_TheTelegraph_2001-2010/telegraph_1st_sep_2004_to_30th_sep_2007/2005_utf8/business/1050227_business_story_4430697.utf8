 Rs 20,000 cr set aside for new journey

 Singh: Money matters

 New Delhi, Feb. 26: Laloo Prasad Yadav has a cash chest of close to Rs 20,000 crore at his command this year.

 The railway minister has been earmarked an annual plan outlay of Rs 15,349 crore and another Rs 3,000 crore as extra budgetary resources for bankable projects of the railways.

 Railway Board chairman R. K. Singh told reporters that if the expenditure on the safety schemes was included it would nudge up to Rs 20,000 crore.

 The government has provided a budgetary support of Rs 7281 crore, marginally higher than the Rs 7,020 crore given last year.

 However, this works out to around 45 per cent of the budget and is higher than 35 to 38 per cent budgetary support provided during the tenure of the Vajpayee government.

 The railways will be providing Rs 4,718 crore for plan expenditure through internal resource generation, which is Rs 990 crore higher than the corresponding figure of the previous year. 

 The railways will also be going in for market borrowings to the tune of Rs 3,400 crore from Indian Railways Finance Corporation to bridge the gap in its annual plan spending. 

 The new budget anticipates a Rs 4,183 crore increase in gross traffic receipts over 2004-05 to touch the Rs 50,968 crore mark. 

 Singh said that 60 per cent increase in the provision of the depreciation reserve fund to contribute Rs 3,604 crore to this vital reserve represents a source of strength for the railways. 

 This funds are available with the railways and they can be drawn immediately in an urgent situation when development works have to be taken up. Last year, only Rs 2,267 crore was set side under this heading. 

 Ordinary working expenses of the railways for the year have been estimated at Rs 35,600 crore, which is 7 per cent more than the expenses incurred during 2003-04. 

 Higher diesel prices alone are expected to increase railway expenses by Rs 954 crore during the year and the increased steel prices will lead to more expenditure on development works. 

 The appropriation to the pension fund will also drain the railways of Rs 6,940 crore.

 However, the railways expect to put cost saving measures in place to bring down the working cost to earnings ratio down to 83 per cent from 87 per cent in 2003-04.

 After the implementation of the Fifth Pay Commission, this is the first time in eight years that the cost-earning ratio is expected to come down to this level.

 US wants China to open up further

 KEITH BRADSHER

 Reaching out

 Beijing, Nov. 15: Senior US officials exhorted China on Monday to open its markets further, but also asked for its help in breaking an impasse in global trade talks, displaying a combination of demands and pleas that increasingly characterises the relationship between the two countries.

 In speeches and interviews here just six days before President Bush arrives in Beijing, both Rob Portman, the US trade representative, and David A. Sampson, the deputy secretary of commerce, repeated previous demands for China to protect American copyrights, trademarks and patents, and that more American companies be allowed to compete in Chinas domestic market.

 But Portman said he had also urged senior Chinese officials to become more active in World Trade Organisation negotiations to produce a new global trade pact.

 I believe that China, being a major player now in the global trading system, and a major beneficiary of the multilateral trading system, has a responsibility to be more engaged in the talks, he said.

 The demands for changes to Chinese domestic policies coupled with a request for Chinese help in WTO negotiations shows how the Sino-American economic relationship is becoming as complex as the two countries security relationship.

 Pentagon officials have struggled to balance their challenges to Chinas military policy ? particularly urging China to slow its rapid military build-up in coastal provinces facing Taiwan ? with appeals for China to use its influence to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons programme.

 On the economic front, the United States particularly hopes China will join demands from many countries for the European Union to accept deep reductions in its farm subsidies, Portman said. President Hu Jintao of China has been touring Europe for the last week, but has said nothing on trade.

 I havent told them what to do, but I think its fairly obvious: Once becoming engaged, you cant help but see that the problem right now is that the European Union is not willing to agree to an agriculture proposal that provides for meaningful market access and until they do, it is impractical to think this round can be successful, he said.

 EU officials have contended that the main obstacle lies in the reluctance of large developing countries like Brazil to sharply cut their tariffs on imported industrial goods. 

 They were also irritated by the 11th-hour offer of cuts in farm subsidies from the United States, which had stalled on the issue.

 Portmans comments reflected growing American frustration with Chinas near silence on the global trade talks. Just four weeks remain until trade ministers from 148 countries and customs territories arrive for negotiations in Hong Kong, but Chinese officials have largely stayed on the sidelines.

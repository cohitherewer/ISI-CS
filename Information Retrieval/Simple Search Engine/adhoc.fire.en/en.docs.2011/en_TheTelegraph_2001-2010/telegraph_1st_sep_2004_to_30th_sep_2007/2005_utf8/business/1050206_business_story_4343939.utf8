 BSNL picks up Baijal call

 TAPAS CHAKRABORTY

 Untangling the mesh 

 Kanpur, Feb. 5: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd today promised to ?reconsider? the telecom regulator?s proposal of opening up the former?s last mile connectivity to private operators for broadband services.

 The proposal was mooted by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India?s chairman Pradip Baijal at an international communication and computing conference here and was directed at BSNL chief A. K. Sinha, who also attended the conference.

 Baijal said instead of losing the value of such a huge network, it was best to work jointly to fully leverage the potential.

 Responding to Baijal?s request, Sinha said, ?His department would not have any problem in providing the infrastructure to private parties and he was ready to reconsider since this proposal has come from the Trai chief.?

 ?I plead with BSNL to unbundle the last mile of copper to fully leverage the potential of its huge network. I also request BSNL to open up the fibre last mile exchange,? Baijal said.

 The Trai chief said unbundling would help the ?broadband industry grow by allowing last mile connectivity to private players?.

 The department of telecom had earlier turned down this proposal of Trai due to BSNL?s strong opposition.

 Baijal said the value of last mile might be reduced to ?trash? at some point of time, giving the example of ?British Telecom when the government there realised it and opened up?.

 Worldwide last-mile opening up by the incumbent has been a controversial issue.

 Sinha said BSNL would ?first like to aggressively use our own last mile?, adding that ?how much of that 42 million last mile is suitable for broadband connection is also doubtful?.

 ?Our past experience has shown that if we open up our last mile to the private players for broadband, they might use it for telecom purposes and lure away our customers,? Sinha said.

 But Sinha assured Baijal that BSNL might seriously think of opening up of last mile again. 

 ?Despite our own reasons, if the regulator has requested again, we have to think about it seriously again,? Sinha said.

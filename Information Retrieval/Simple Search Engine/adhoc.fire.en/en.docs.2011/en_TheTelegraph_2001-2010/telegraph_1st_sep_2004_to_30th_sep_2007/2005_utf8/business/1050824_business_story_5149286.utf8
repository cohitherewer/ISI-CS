 Panel favours new airports in two metros

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: The high-powered parliamentary panel on transport has recommended setting up greenfield airports in Delhi and Mumbai instead of undertaking costly renovation of the existing cramped airfields. 

 Panel chairman Nilotpal Basu said Mumbais traffic projections showed that the present airfield would be completely choked by 2012 and a second runway is impossible to construct given the space constraints. 

 The committee fails to understand how the huge investment for modernising the airport could be justified when the existing constraints do not permit new capacity additions, Basu said, while recommending a greenfield airport for the city rather than going ahead with the costly make-over. 

 He also said the existing infrastructure at the Delhi airport would be inadequate to handle the growth projected by the government. The committee recommends that the government should explore the possibility of having a greenfield airport in Delhi too.

 However, the group of ministers (GoM) on airports has been divided on these issues. The report and the contradictions within the GoM might affect the actual privatisation process. 

 Slums surrounding the Mumbai airport have long held up the development of more runway space, which is required at the overcrowded Santa Cruz airport. This means, in any case, a new airport would have to be built for Mumbai, pointed out the GoM.

 In concurrence with the Basu committees recommendations, several members of the GoM as well as technical experts have suggested a new airport for Delhi before the Commonwealth Games to tackle the huge international and domestic traffic to the capital. 

 It now seems privatisation of these airports may not give the desired results. The GoM, too, accepts the problems ... there is a need to rethink the issue, Basu said.

 The committee said Rs 13,786 crore, required to modernise Delhi and Mumbai airports, would be used in a phased manner over the next 15 to 20 years. It implied that the Airports Authority of India would leverage these funds. This will not only ensure management control of the proposed airports in the hands of Indian nationals but also protect the safety, security and sovereignty of the country, Basu said.

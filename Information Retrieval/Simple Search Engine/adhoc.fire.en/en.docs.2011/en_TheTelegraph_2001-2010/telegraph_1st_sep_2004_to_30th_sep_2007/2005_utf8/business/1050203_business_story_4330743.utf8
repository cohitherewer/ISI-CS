 BSNL laughs its way to banks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: The government today extended a financial relief of more than Rs 2,700 crore to Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) to be paid during 2004-05 and 2005-06.

 The Union cabinet approved the proposal of the communications ministry to reimburse a part of the licence fee and spectrum charges paid by BSNL.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram said Rs 1,408.9 crore would be reimbursed to BSNL, which is two-third of Rs 2,113.35 crore payable by the public sector telecom company as licence fee and spectrum charges for the current financial year.

 The cabinet also cleared the reimbursement of one-third of the licence fee and spectrum charges payable by BSNL in 2005-06. This will give the company Rs 700 crore as reimbursed fee.

 The government extended the reimbursement of backlog of Rs 591.02 crore on account of the shortfall in the reimbursement of licence fee and spectrum charges paid by BSNL between 2001-02 and 2003-04. ?The steps taken by government is commendable, but we had proposed a higher amount for reimbursement in view of the responsibilities and the social obligations like offering services in rural areas,? a senior BSNL official said.

 The cabinet also approved communications ministry?s proposal of absorbing the group ?A? officers belonging to Indian Telecom Services, Postal and Telegraph Accounts and Finance Services and others in BSNL and MTNL.

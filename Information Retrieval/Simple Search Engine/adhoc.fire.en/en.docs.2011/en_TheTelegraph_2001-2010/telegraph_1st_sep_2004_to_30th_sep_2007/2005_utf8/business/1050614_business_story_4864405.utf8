 Nokia lists growth spots 

 Singapore, June 13 (PTI) Identifying India and China as the engines of mobile phone growth, the Finnish cellular handset maker Nokia today said global mobile phone users would swell to 3 billion by the turn of this decade.

 Nokia estimates the global mobile subscriber will grow to 1.7 billion at the end of 2004 and to reach 3 billion by 2010, said Urpo Karjalainen, senior vice-president, Nokia. 

 Mobile penetration in the Asia Pacific region is expected to be a major contributor to the global growth and surpass the magical 2 billion mark by this year, he told reporters at the companys annual event Nokia Connections 2005.

 Of these new subscriptions, nearly half are expected to come from Asia Pacific countries including China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam. And nearly 80 per cent of the next billion subscribers are expected to come from new growth markets and lower-spending segments.

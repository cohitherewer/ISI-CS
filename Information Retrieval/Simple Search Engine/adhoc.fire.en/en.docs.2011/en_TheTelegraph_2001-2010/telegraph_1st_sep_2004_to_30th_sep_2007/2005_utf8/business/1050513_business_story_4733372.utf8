 New Delhi, May 12: There?s a new set of hot wheels on the roads: It?s the Porsche 911 Carrera Cabriolet that sports a price tag of Rs 75 lakh.

 The low-slung two-seater sports car has a top speed of 285 kmph and can go from zero to 100 kmph in 5.2 seconds. With a 3.5-litre engine under the bonnet, the Porsche Cabriolet has a range of features that will attract the discriminating car buff.

 ?This new addition to the Indian market from the Porsche stable symbolises the growing market for luxury cars in India,? said Satya Bagla, director for Exclusive Motors, which is Porsche?s dealer in Delhi.

 Porsche AG, the German carmaker, has tied up with Sheryan Motors for selling the luxury cars in Mumbai.

 Porsche, which made its entry into India in the middle of last year, hopes to clock sales of 100 units by July this year. The sales target for the next year is ?reasonably high?, said Bagla.

 Apart from the new model, Porsche offers the SUV Cayenne and sports cars Boxter and Carrera in India, along with some of their variants coming at a price range of Rs 50 lakh to Rs 75 lakh.

 Bagla said there was a growing market for luxury cars in India. ?Porsche has seen success with its other models which have already hit the Indian roads,? he added.

 Despite paying a high import duty of 104 per cent to import the completely built units (CBUs) from its headquarters, it seems the carmaker is not yet chalking plans to set up a subsidiary in India.

 ?The market in India for sports cars has not really matured. The general perception is that it is out of reach. However, there is a trend which is catching on,? Bagla said.

 Declining to specify the advertising and promotion budget for Porsche, he said, ?We will keep investing as and when needed.?

 For more than 40 years now, 911 Carrera Cabriolet has thrilled car enthusiasts all over the world.

 The market for luxury cars in India has seen the entry of some premium brands like the Maybach, Bentley, Rolls Royce and Audi.

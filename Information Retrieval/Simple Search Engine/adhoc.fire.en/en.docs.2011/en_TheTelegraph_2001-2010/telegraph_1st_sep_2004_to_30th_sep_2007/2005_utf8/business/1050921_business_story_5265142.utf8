 Overseas listing buzz around Reliance

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 20: So Reliance Industries has caught the foreign fever. Or has it?

 Five years back, Anil Ambani had voiced hopes of listing Reliance on the New York Stock Exchange.

 Today, a senior company official again alluded to a possible listing in New York or London along with plans for oil acquisitions in Europe and the US.

 Atul Chandra, president of Reliances international operations, was quoted by foreign agencies as saying that the company could acquire businesses in the downstream petrochemicals sector, but it could also be upstream, in oil and gas exploration and production.

 Chandra, while denying that Reliance has considered a bid for Innovene, said, When Reliance sets its sight on a target, it may consider a listing in a western financial centre, such as London or New York. 

 But first we need to be there, with operations in this part of the world, he added.

 Innovene is BPs petrochemical business, due to be listed by the end of the year.

 RIL officials declined comment. However, sources said the plan for acquisition was indicated by chairman Mukesh Ambani at the annual general meeting last month. Theres nothing new in that, they added.

 Sources added it is unlikely that Reliance will dilute its equity capital by raising capital abroad. What could instead happen is that its treasury stock, valued at Rs 12,000 crore and accounting for about 12 per cent, could be placed in the foreign markets. This would ensure that the equity capital is pegged at current levels without the promoters holding declining, even as Reliance manages to raise the capital required for its acquisitions and expansion.

 Analysts feel this is more probable and a listing would be possible after the demerger of the four companies in favour of Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprises is complete.

 If RIL harbours hopes of a foreign listing, it would need to be more transparent as NYSE follows a strict code of disclosure.

 The news sent the Reliance share racing and it registered the highest turnover of Rs 269.47 crore on the BSE. The scrip, which represents more than 10 per cent of the weightage of the sensex, flared up Rs 13.90 to Rs 778.50.

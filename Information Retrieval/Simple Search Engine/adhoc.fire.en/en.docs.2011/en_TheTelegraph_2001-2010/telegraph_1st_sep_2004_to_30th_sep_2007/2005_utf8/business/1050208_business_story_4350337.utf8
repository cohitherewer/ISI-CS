 HDFC Bank, Nafed in pact on farm loan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 7: HDFC Bank and the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation (Nafed) have signed an agreement to fund farmers, village-level aggregators and Nafed-associated co-operatives. 

 The funds would help farmers avoid distress sale of crops. In a joint press statement, the bank and Nafed said the tie-up will enable farmers to ?avoid distress sale? of their agricultural produce and also provide them with an option to arrange for a sale at a ?suitable opportunity?. 

 Under this arrangement, HDFC Bank, which has been foraying into newer segments, will play an active role in the agriculture sector that is still vastly untapped. 

 The bank said it would lend funds to farmers at competitive market rates, while Nafed would play the role of a facilitator.

 Nafed will not only disseminate market information but will also help farmers arrange the sale of their produce at the best possible price.

 Speaking on the occasion, Nafed managing director Alok Ranjan said under this agreement, small and marginal farmers stand to gain the most as they are often forced to make distress sale due to limited holding capacity. 

 Harish Engineer, executive director of HDFC Bank, said this was another step towards increasing the credit availability to needy farmers. 

 Elaborating the scheme, Engineer said it would provide immediate finance to a maximum of 70 per cent to farmers against the deposit of the stock with designated warehouses. 

 The farmers are free to sell the stock at any time during the six months from the date of depositing it.

 Ministries lock horns over twin selloffs

 New Delhi, June 3: A war of sorts has broken out between the finance and mines ministries. The former is keen to push divestment in aluminium giants Balco and Nalco, while the latter does not want to part with its shares in the two firms. 

 The finance ministry has been pressing mines minister Sis Ram Ola to agree to sell the rump holding of 49 per cent that it still owns in Bharat Aluminium. The previous BJP government had sold Balco to Sterlite and offloaded a 20 per cent stake in Nalco in the open market. 

 Ola is refusing to budge. His point is that Balcos 49 per cent stake sale would fetch about Rs 1,500 crore to Rs 2,000 crore now but could fetch much more a year or two later, especially if the sale is made through the open market. But we will have to go through the fine print of the sale agreement ... if there is no escape clause we may be forced to sell to Sterlite, quot; he said. 

 The finance ministrys proposal has already been attacked by a section of the government which feels Sterlite has violated the terms of the sale pact by transferring ownership to a foreign entity even before the end of a period during which it was not supposed to transfer ownership to any other firm. 

 Finance ministry officials, however, point out that since a clause in the Balco selloff pact stipulated that it could either decide against the residual sale or if it did not take a decision then it would have to let the stake pass on to Sterlite at a fixed price after a lapse of six months. As Sterlites application was filed while the BJP was in power and no decision was taken, there is little the Congress-led government can now do, they claim.

 Similarly, in Nalcos case, Ola is against offloading shares at this stage when aluminium rates have taken a beating in the global market. quot;I have received a letter proposing a stake sale in Nalco but we should think over it. 

 The view in North Block is simple. The two sales could generate between Rs 3,500 crore and Rs 4,000 crore. Nalcos market cap stands at over Rs 9,400 crore and a 20 per cent bite out of it would be worth over Rs 1,800 crore. This is far more than the Rs 600 crore that might be generated by last weeks decision to sell a 10 per cent stake in Bharat Electricals Ltd.

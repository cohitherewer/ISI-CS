 Calcutta, Jan. 29: Sweden is keen to help Bengal in developing the small and medium segments of business and has urged local industry to identify areas of collaboration.

 Speaking at an interaction organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Swedish ambassador Inga Eriksson Fogh said, ?We had a meeting with state information technology minister Manabendra Mukherjee and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen today and discussed trade relations and investment possibilities.?

 Amiya Bhattacharya, who is the chief consultant of Techno Transfer International and is a member of the Swedish India Business Policy, said, ?The growth in the small and medium sector will help India compete with China. It has to, however, upgrade the quality and productivity levels.?

 He said India could bank on the expertise of Swedish firms especially in the areas of solid and e-waste disposal, logistics, management of industrial processes and energy conservation and management.

 ?Many new Swedish firms are interested in setting up base here. India offers a good base for exports to other countries in Asia. The country also offers a competitive base for R amp;D and manufacturing,? Fogh said. 

 Swedish companies Volvo, ABB and SKF already have operations in India.

 ?There is immense scope for collaboration between India and Sweden. Last year, bilateral trade between the two countries amounted to $1.5 billion with Swedish exports crossing $1 billion,? she added.

 BSNL scrambles to keep landline users from hanging up

 Getting the Basics right

 Calcutta, July 24: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) has decided to take the competition from promotional tariffs offered by private operators head on and has empowered its circle heads to offer matching tariff rates.

 The alarming slide in landline subscriptions (b-fone) has forced the state-run telecom service provider to take urgent steps to stop the churn as it is banking heavily on this subscriber base for the success of its mobile service CellOne and broadband service DataOne.

 BSNL had lost 36 lakh subscribers last financial year ? about 70 per cent of the connections were terminated due to non-payment. In Calcutta alone, the company saw a 10 per cent slump in its subscriber base with 78 per cent people not paying their dues.

 In a circular to the circle heads, chairman and managing director A.K. Sinha said: ?one of the basic reasons for the surrender of b-fone is that it is being perceived to have higher rentals. We have empowered the circle heads to offer matching tariffs with those of others. Some of the circles were able to offer innovative tariff schemes to improve retention and also acquire additional customers.

 The circle heads have also been advised to take note of local conditions and take all necessary steps to stop the churn. A monthly report on the status of subscriptions in each circle will also have to be submitted to the corporate office by the third of each month.

 The company has also put in place a scheme that makes it mandatory for an officer to attend personally to a customer who puts in a request for surrender. The Madhya Pradesh circle has been able to stop 50 per cent of surrender requests by implementing it.

 The corporate office has also issued a policy guideline wherein a franchisee is permitted to sell b-fone at attractive commissions and get an additional 25 per cent commission based on the basic price if the customer is retained for more than a year.

 The BSNL circles will also conduct regular tariff analysis to stay competitive.

 Sinha admitted in the circular that in most places, the quality of response on the call (made to the call centre) and subsequent attention to a customer grievance is still very poor. He feels that the customer care centres should be converted to a single point solution providers.

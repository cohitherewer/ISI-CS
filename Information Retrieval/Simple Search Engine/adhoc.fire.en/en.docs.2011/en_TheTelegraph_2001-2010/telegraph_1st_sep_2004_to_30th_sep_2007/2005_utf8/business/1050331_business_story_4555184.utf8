 Pepsi word of wisdom for MPs

 OUR BUREAU

New Delhi, March 30: PepsiCo president and 

chief financial officer Indra Nooyi today met parliamentarians for a closed-door 

meeting and advised them on budget-making and planning. 

 She followed this up with a meeting with finance minister P. Chidambaram, though sources said she did not try to give the minister any similar advice.

 Nooyi told the MPs that India routinely makes five-year plans, which it ignores while making its budget. 

 She pointed out that even a company like Pepsi plans for three years and then budgets accordingly. It then conducts quarterly reviews to check where it has missed out.

 ?She also pointed out something which I have felt many times while going through our budget figures ? money meant for projects are routinely not spent. This means nothing happens to those projects or else in some cases there is gross over-spending, which means somebody forgot to keep a proper check,? said Dinesh Trivedi, senior Trinamul MP from Bengal, who attended the meeting. 

 Trivedi also said, ?Nooyi was bullish on India. She feels that the main asset of Indians can easily be their capability and brain power ? assets that should carry us far. Naturally we agree with that.?

 The closed-door meeting was organised by the Indo-US parliamentary forum, a body formed under the aegis of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 Nooyi also spoke about how the world was collectively looking at India as an investment destination.

 Emphasising the role of public-private partnership, Nooyi said infrastructure and power were the two main sectors in need for such collaboration.

 Armed with adequate statistics on almost all spheres, she enquired about the country?s future vision.

 MP Ashwini Kumar requested PepsiCo to take the lead to invest in Punjab. Nooyi said she will look into it. 

 Sachin Pilot, Murli Deora, Ajay Maken, Dinesh Trivedi, A. R. Shaheen, Rajeev Bakshi and Manu Anand were some of the other participants.

 This is Nooyis second visit to India after she took over as the president of PepsiCo.

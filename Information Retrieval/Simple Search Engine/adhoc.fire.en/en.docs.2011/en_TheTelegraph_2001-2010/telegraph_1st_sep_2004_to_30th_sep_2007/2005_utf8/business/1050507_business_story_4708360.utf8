 Inflation rate rises to 5.91%

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 6: The rate of inflation rose to 5.91 per cent for the week ended April 23, much higher than the Reserve Banks forecast of an annual 5-5.5 per cent rate for this financial year.

 An official report said the rise could be attributed to higher prices of vegetables, fruits, edible oil, tea, metals, industrial fuel and manufactured products. 

 The wholesale price index (WPI) based inflation rose to 5.91 per cent from 5.64 per cent a week ago.

 WPI was up 0.4 per cent to 191.9 points from 191.2 a week ago. Prices of primary articles rose 0.8 per cent, fuel rates increased 0.2 per cent, while manufacturing went up by 0.2 per cent.

 The rate was 4.32 per cent during the same period a year ago.

 It was hovering over 6 per cent in December, slid to 4.5 per cent in February and has been on a high since end-March.

 Despite warnings from the RBI on hardening crude prices, the government has not allowed oil companies to increase the domestic rates of petrol, diesel, kerosene and LPG so far.

 Prices of furnace oil rose 4 per cent and bitumen by a per cent with global oil rates hardening to over $55 a barrel on concerns of a gasoline shortage due to refinery problems in the US.

 During a discussion on the budget, finance minister P Chidambaram had sought to allay fears that an increase in excise duties on petroleum products would lead to a rise in prices, saying it was ?revenue-neutral?.

 While seasonal factors might have led to a rise in rates of fruits, vegetables and tea, there was a sudden spurt in prices of steel items, electrical generators, power looms and chemicals.

 Two more in penny net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 5: Two more in the penny pincer. The promoters of Ind Tra Deco and Eltrol were today barred from trading in the shares of their companies after investigations showed them rigging the prices of the scrip.

 Preliminary examination revealed that the company issued several announcements, including stock split in July-August 2005, while the promoters and directors and persons acting in concert were off-loading the shares of the company. Besides, artificial volumes were created through bulk deals and cross-deals, said G. Anantharaman, member of Sebi, which cracked the whip. 

 Anantharaman said the order was a result of the probe into trading and a spurt in the shares of companies with low market capitalisation ? commonly referred to as the small-cap or penny stocks ? in recent times.

 Ind Tra Deco, listed on the BSE, witnessed sharp price variations during March to September. The stock went up from Rs 5.81 (below par) on March 1 to Rs 22.65 on September 1 ? the price adjusted for a stock split. The jump, in 129 trading sessions, was four times or 300 per cent. 

 Since 2002, the shares of the firm have traded below par, at Rs 4, but rocketed in July this year. The surge continued even after BSE reduced price filters from 20 per cent to 10 per cent. The stock was being watched by Sebi and bourses, which were trying to determine if the rise in volumes and price arose from unfair trade practices or market manipulation. 

 Eltrol, the other firm in the line of fire, has been forbidden from issuing shares or instruments convertible into equity; it cannot alter its capital structure either. India Infoline Securities was the broker through which deals in Ind Tra Deco shares were routed. The online brokerage also saw some of its clients face the heat over IFSL. J.N. Jhaveri, Fortis Securities, Galaxy Broking were also asked to stay away from the shares of the firms punished today.

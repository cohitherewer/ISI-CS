 Buddha aims to break iron grip

 Calcutta, Nov. 8: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee doesn?t want Bengal to suffer the slings and arrows of egregious policy-making by grubby politicians. Not if he can help it ? and not as long as Manmohan Singh?s UPA government depends on support from the Left.

 Bhattacharjee has had grand plans to rope in steelmakers from across the country to set up plants in the state. The trouble is that mineral-rich Jharkhand and Orissa have refused to supply iron ore to these plants and have lobbied the same industrialists to come to their states and set up the plants there.

 Jharkhand has lured Laxmi Niwas Mittal ? the world?s largest steelmaker ? to set up a 10-million-tonne plant in the state, while Orissa has attracted South Korea?s Posco. Bengal has a few offers as well but the recalcitrant stand taken by the two states threatens to scupper a strong industrial revival in the state.

 Bhattacharjee will have none of this: he is now persuading the Manmohan Singh government to lay down a national policy that will streamline distribution of critical mineral inputs like iron ore.

 Bengal ? a huge victim of the freight equalisation policy of the sixties that was loaded against the eastern states ? doesn?t want to be short-changed for a second time because of competitive opportunism among the mineral-rich states in the east.

 ?The Centre must come out with a clear-cut policy on (harnessing) iron ore reserves. I have discussed it with the Prime Minister as well,? Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, chief minister of Bengal, said at a meeting in Calcutta today.

 The Left Front had fought tooth and nail against the freight equalisation policy and finally it was discontinued in the early nineties. A number of small iron and steel units came up in Bengal.

 However, following the upturn in the global steel industry, big bucks have flowed into states like Jharkhand, Orissa and Chhattisgarh. Bengal received only one big offer from Jindal Group which promised a Rs 12,000- crore investment here. The project ran into rough weather when Jharkhand denied ore to Bengal.

 The Jindals have now decided to relocate a major part of the industry to Jharkhand.

 ?I have been pursuing for a long time. I met the PM along with Jharkhand chief minister Arjun Munda and discussed the problem. But nothing has come out so far,? he said. He argued if states start behaving like this ? for instance if Bengal refused to give coal ? the steel industry would be in doldrums.

 Vesuvius unit

 Bhattacharjee today laid the foundation stone for the expansion of Vesuvius Indias capacity here at Taratalla Road in Calcutta. The company will spend Rs 100 crore to double its capacity, managing director Biswadip Gupta said.

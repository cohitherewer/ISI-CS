 Dena Bank loss at Rs 39 cr

 Nair: Funding plans

 Mumbai, May 20: Dena Bank has suffered a net loss of Rs 39.20 crore in the fourth quarter ended March 31 compared with a profit of Rs 58.39 crore in the corresponding period last year.

 In 2004-05, the net profit of the bank came down to Rs 61 crore from Rs 230.50 crore in 2003-04, a drop of 74 per cent. 

 The net profit is down because of a provision of Rs 81 crore to shift securities worth Rs 1,500 crore to the HTM category and Rs 61 crore for wage revision.

 There was a steep fall of Rs 323 crore in trading profits from the gilt portfolio during the year. 

 However, the bank has posted a 10 per cent growth in its net interest income to Rs 686.59 crore from Rs 592.27 crore last year. While the net interest margin improved to 3.08 per cent, its asset quality was also better with net non-performing assets (NPAs) declining to 5.23 per cent from 9.40 per cent. 

 The retail loan book of the bank nearly doubled to Rs 1477 crore from Rs 758 crore.

 Net advances of the bank during the year were Rs 11308.59 crore, up 20 per cent from Rs 9411.79 crore in 2003-04. Deposits, on the other hand, stood at Rs 20,096.09 crore (Rs 18,349.18 crore).

 Chairman and managing director (additional charge) M. V. Nair said the bank would continue its focus on the retail segment. It would also position itself as one of the preferred banks in the western region to fund the SME and agriculture segments. 

 While the Finmarts, launched by the bank to push up retail lending, are successful, there are plans to scale up their presence to 100. Dena Bank is also looking at a hub-and-spoke model to distribute retail products in addition to the branch-based model. The bank may, therefore, seek the help of direct selling agents to push its retail products.

 While cash recoveries rose to Rs 225.97 crore in 2004-05 from Rs 227.53 crore in the previous year, Nair said Dena Bank has set a target to bring down its net sticky assets to below 2 per cent.

 Novartis net dips

 Pharma major Novartis has registered a 42 per cent dip in net profit at Rs 65.12 crore for the financial year ended March 31, 2005 compared with Rs 113.76 crore in the corresponding previous fiscal.

 The board has recommended a dividend of 200 per cent on a Rs 5 share. Total income has decreased from Rs 563.06 crore in 2003-04 to Rs 510.87 crore in 2004-05.

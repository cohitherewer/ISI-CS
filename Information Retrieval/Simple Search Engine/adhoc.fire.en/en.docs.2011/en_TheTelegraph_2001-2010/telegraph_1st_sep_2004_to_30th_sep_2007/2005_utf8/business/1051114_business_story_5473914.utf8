 Australia eyes retail pie

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Nov. 13: Australia has unveiled an investment plan of Aus $1.20 million (Rs 5 crore approx) for the next couple of years to increase the presence of Australian food and related products in the Indian retail sector.

 Peter McGauran, the visiting Australian agriculture, fisheries and forestry minister, said this experiment will initially start in Bangalore as part of Australias efforts to build on its presence in south India.

 There will be small but exclusive Australian sections within Indian supermarkets, McGauran said. 

 This was a totally independent initiative and our main interest is to link up with the local businesses, as Indian retailing is smaller in size and are family businesses, he added. 

 Part of the investment could be used for market research and improving the delivery systems, he added.

 Australia wants to add its wine, honey and beverages to the Indian market. However, this will not be in isolation to the requirements of local retailers, he said. 

 The minister was here to officially open the Australian pavilion at the Foodpro fair, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry once in two years. 

 McGauran had met agriculture minister Sharad Pawar in New Delhi on Friday. The Australian minister said certain bilateral issues had to be sorted out to step up the two-way trade in agriculture and related products. 

 There were certain quarantine and bio-security issues to be addressed, and this has to be resolved on the basis of science and not used as a bargaining chip, the Australian minister said. 

 An agricultural counsellor has also been appointed. The counsellor will be stationed in the Australian Embassy in New Delhi to interact with the government and companies to promote Australian farm products and processed foods.

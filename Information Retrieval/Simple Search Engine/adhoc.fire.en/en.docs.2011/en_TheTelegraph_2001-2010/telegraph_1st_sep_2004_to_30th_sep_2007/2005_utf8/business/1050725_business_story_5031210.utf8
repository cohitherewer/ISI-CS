 Calcutta, July 24: Max New York Life plans to forge distribution alliance with more banks for its insurance products. The insurer is also eyeing at other distribution channels to widen its reach to the people.

 We are keen on forging relationships with more banks, both in the public and private sectors. This will give us access to more number of branches and locations, said Gary Bennett, managing director and chief executive officer, Max New York Life.

 Though we shall leverage various distribution channels, our main focus shall remain on our agency sales force with over 9,000 agent advisors. However, we would try to broaden and deepen the geographical expansion and also increase the agency force, he added.

 The insurer is also planning to introduce new products catering to varied customers needs. We have applied to the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) for the approval of two new unit-linked savings products, Bennett added.

 We shall also keep our options open for mergers and acquisitions as it is a part of every growing industry, though we have no such plans in the near future, said Bennett.

 On AMPs backing out from its joint venture with Sanmar, Bennett said, It might adversely affect the reputation of the foreign partners in insurance joint ventures.

 Though we are interested in buying out AMPs stake in AMP Sanmar Life, we feel that picking up the pie would be more suitable for a new entrant in the Indian insurance industry. An acquisition at this juncture would ensue substantial restructuring, he added. 

 The company has sold over half a million individual policies with a cumulative sum assured of more than Rs 16,700 crore.

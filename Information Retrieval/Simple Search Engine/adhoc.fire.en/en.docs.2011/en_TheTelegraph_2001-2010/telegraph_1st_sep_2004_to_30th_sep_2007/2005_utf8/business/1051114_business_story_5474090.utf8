The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Q amp;A

 Good advice

 I deposited an income tax refund cheque for Rs 509 drawn on the RBI, Calcutta, in my bank account a couple of times, but each time it was dishonoured. The Reserve Bank sent a slip along with the cheque saying: Advice not received. Please present again. I cant understand what this means. How do I realise the amount?

 S. K. Mitra, Calcutta

 The I-T department sends the advice along with the refund order if the tax refund is less than Rs 1,000. If it is more than that, the advice is sent to the RBI directly. If you receive a refund cheque for more than Rs 1,000, you should wait for a week before depositing the cheque because the advice takes time to reach the RBI. If you hadnt received the advice it must have been misplaced. You now have to contact the I-T circle that had issued your refund order, to obtain a fresh advice and a new cheque.

 Hello brother

 My brother, who is settled in the US, remits $500 every month. Do I have to include the amount in my taxable income?

 Pritha Majumdar, Calcutta

 Any amount received from blood relations is exempt 

 from tax. However, it is advisable to submit a gift 

 deed duly signed by your brother (as donor) and by you 

 (as donee).

 Benefit poser

 Is there any income tax benefit on home loan insurance?

 Ritesh Sharma, by e-mail

 No, there is no income tax benefit on a home loan insurance.

 Going by the book

 If there is a transfer of shares at the end of a fiscal, who is entitled to receive the dividend for that year, the transferor or the transferee?

 Madhabi D. Ghosh, Calcutta

 The person whose name appears in the books of the company as on the record date of the dividend will be entitled to receive the dividend amount. If the process of transfer is complete by that record date, then the transferee will receive the dividend, if not, then the transferor will receive it.

 TV makers go flat out this season

 New Delhi, Aug. 21: Like bellies, flat tellys are really hot this season. And they?re beginning to push the good old, cathode ray tube (CRT) television sets ? the CRTs ? out of the frame. Does it spell the death of the CRT sets? Not quite. But in the metros, the lounging couch potatoes are lunging for the ?sleek and flat? look ? at least for their TV sets.

 India is just beginning to follow a trend that has been clearly established worldwide, even though it is still a slow process of change in a market that is driven by volume sales. 

 ?Given the size, the CRT-based televisions still dominate the market in total numbers, even though flat televisions are showing higher growth,? says Ravinder Zutshi, deputy managing director of Samsung India Electronics. According to industry estimates, the flat TV market in the first six months of the current year has shown a growth of 78.3 per cent compared with conventional televisions, which have shown a negative growth of 19.8 per cent.

 While sales of flat TVs accounted for a mere 6 per cent of the total television market in 2002, it accounted for 25 per cent of overall sales last year. This year, it is expected to increase to 40 per cent, a Samsung India official said.

 ?All the developed markets in the US and Europe have shifted to flat panels from CRTs. Growth in spending of urban consumers and change in lifestyle patterns will boost the sales of flat panels,? a Sony India official said.

 Colour TV makers say worldwide CRT-based televisions are fast becoming obsolete. ?This is because the huge protruding yoke of the television set gives it a bulky look. Also, flat TVs, including LCD and plasma, offer a picture clarity that is two-and-a-half times better than the conventional TVs,? says Amitabh Tiwari, head-consumer electronics at LG Electronics India Limited (LGEIL).With an average price of Rs 1,25,000, the flat panel TV market is estimated at around Rs 450 crore. Industry players, however, say improvisation is the key to ensure voluminous sales of CRTs. For the first time, LG has started importing CRTs from its parent company in Korea.?These are being imported in small numbers to cater to our recently launched magic slim TVs. Despite using a CRT, the TV is 30 per cent slimmer than any other conventional television,? adds Tiwari.

 Samtel, Hotline and JCT are the major manufacturers of colour picture tubes in India.

 Samtel had earlier said the global market for CRTs is expected to record a degrowth over the next five to six years. The size of the global market was estimated at 185 to 190 million units in 2004, of which CRT TVs accounted for 160 million units and flat panels for 20 to 25 million units. Globally, the TV market is expected to increase to 220 million sets. ?However, CRT TV sales may fall to 145 to 155 million units and most of the growth is expected to come from the flat TVs,? contends Samtel.

 CRTs constitute 45 to 50 per cent of the total cost of the TV. About 15 per cent of tubes are imported in India. CRTs attract a duty of 15 per cent now, which is likely to fall by 5 per cent every year. It will come down to zero per cent in the next three years. But by then, the market for TVs is likely to undergo a radical change.

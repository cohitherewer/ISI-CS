 Ford finds the going tough

 New York, Nov. 19 (Reuters): Ford Motor Co., facing a deepening financial crisis, said on Friday it plans to eliminate 4,000 salaried jobs, or 10 per cent of its North American white-collar work force, as part of a larger restructuring plan.

 A majority of the job cuts ? announced to employees in an e-mail distributed by Mark Fields, president of Fords America business ? will be made in the first quarter of 2006, spokesman Oscar Suris said.

 The cuts will come through attrition, layoffs and the elimination of some agency and contract positions, Suris said.

 They will be in addition to the 2,750 job losses already announced by the automaker this year,

 Ford lost $284 million in the third quarter and its automotive division is in the red. Its North American vehicle operations have lost more than $1.4 billion before taxes so far this year.

 The companys shares have dropped more than 40 per cent since the end of 2004. 

 Ford chairman and chief executive Bill Ford Jr. said last month that the automaker would announce its long-awaited restructuring plan ? dubbed Way Forward ? in January. He also warned that the plan would include significant plant closing.

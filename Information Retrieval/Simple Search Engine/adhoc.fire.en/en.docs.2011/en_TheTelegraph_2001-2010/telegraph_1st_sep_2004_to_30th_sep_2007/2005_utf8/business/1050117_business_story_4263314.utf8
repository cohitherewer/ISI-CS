 Prod to Yukos talks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 16: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today said the government had asked ONGC Videsh (OVL) to hold talks with Russian oil major Rosneft on the possibility of picking up a stake in the assets of the country?s embattled oil major Yukos. The empowered group of secretaries met last week to discuss the issue and asked OVL to ?delink the equity and debt component relating to the buyout of certain assets of Yukos?, he said on the sidelines of Petrotech-2005.

 The minister felt that while it was a golden opportunity to participate in Russias oil industry, India will have to be cautious because of the legal complications involved.

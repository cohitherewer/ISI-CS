 PF board meet today

 New Delhi, March 19 (PTI): The central board of trustees of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation will meet tomorrow to find ways to cover the estimated gap of Rs 927 crore due to a hike in interest rates announced by finance minister P. Chidambaram for the current financial year.

 K. Chandrasekhar Rao, the chairman of the central board of trustees of EPFO, had made it clear that if it was not able to meet the shortfall, the finance ministry would have to chip in with necessary resources.

 The central board of trustees, which manages about Rs 1,28,000 crore of workers? savings, had met on February 21 but could not take up the issue, tactically putting the blame on elections in certain states.

 The meeting also comes in the wake of an internal committee of EPFO recommending that only 8 per cent interest rate will be sustainable in 2005-06, which the trade unions objected to as they want continuation of the 9.5 per cent rate. However, the finance and investment sub-committee viewed that by offering 9.5 per cent, the expected shortfall could swell to Rs 1,200 crore.

 ?The only way to make EPFO sustainable is to increase the interest on SDS,? W. R. Wardharajan, Citu secretary and a member of the EPF board, said.

 The trustees, meeting for the eighth time after the UPA government came to power, may also consider restricting withdrawals before retirement.

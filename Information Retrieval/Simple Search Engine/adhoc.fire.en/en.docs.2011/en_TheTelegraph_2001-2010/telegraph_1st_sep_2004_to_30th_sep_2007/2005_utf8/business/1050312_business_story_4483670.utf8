 Purwar: Big plans

 Mumbai, March 11: State Bank of India (SBI) plans to raise between Rs 3000 and Rs 4000 crore through subordinated debt to support a huge growth in credit likely to take place next fiscal, chairman A. K. Purwar said.

 The State Bank of India chief, who was speaking on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India, also did not rule out the possibility of going in for a public offering. However, he said the bank is likely to comply with the US-GAAP accounting norms by the end of this fiscal, thereby fuelling speculations of an American depository receipts (ADR) listing.

 ?The credit growth is going to be substantial in the next fiscal in all sectors. Therefore, the bank is exploring the option to raise capital through Tier II bonds worth Rs 3,000-4,000 crore to support the credit growth,? he said.

 Purwar, however, did not specify the time when the bonds would hit the market.

 He also hinted at the possibility of tapping the equity market again. He said, ?I will not rule out the possibility of going for a public offering as the current market is very attractive.?

 Purwar, who expects stable interest rates, however, said rising crude prices remain a key challenge. ?Oil prices are still a cause of concern and any further rise can trigger another spike in inflation,? he said, adding that if inflation is kept within reasonable limits, interest rates are expected to settle down. 

 Apart from crude prices, higher government borrowing and a rise in global interest rates would also impact the interest rates here, he added.

 State Bank of India wants to come out with a subordinated bond issue at a time when nationalised banks are busy tapping the capital market to support expansion of their business. They are also raising these resources to meet the upcoming Basel II norms. 

 With the economy likely to remain in top gear, demand for loans both from corporate and retail customers are predicted to continue in 2005-06 as well.

 This was amplified only yesterday when the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Ltd (HSBC) revealed that it is pumping close to $243 million into its Indian operations to support fast growing retail and commercial business.

 While the bank will inject $150 million as fresh capital, another $93 million will be generated through profits from its Indian operations. HSBC also plans to set up a wholly-owned non-banking finance subsidiary (NBFC) for its consumer finance business. 

 Apart from $150 million fresh capital, close to $30 million will come from retained profits in 2003-04 and another $63 million will be injected in June from retained profits generated during this fiscal.

 Dunlop banks on asset sale for revival

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Fresh life

 Calcutta, Sept. 26: Dunlop India has garnered Rs 66.85 crore by selling its assets and has paid back Rs 102 crore to banks and financial institutions, including the State Bank of India, HSBC, United Bank of India, StanChart Bank and Allahabad Bank through a one-time settlement.

 We have a lot of disposable idle assets with us. We can sell them off to garner funds and restart the operations of the company. However, it all depends on how fast the draft rehabilitation scheme (DRS) is cleared by the Appellate Authority of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (AAIFR). After paying back the banks and FIs, we still have Rs 17 crore left in our accounts, Dunlop India director P. Balakrishnan, who chaired the AGM, told shareholders. AAIFR has called a meeting of Dunlop India on October 4.

 The National Productivity Council, a government agency, has been appointed by the company to study its operations and recommend a suitable business plan for its turnaround. The recommendations of NPC will be included in the DRS, which is being reworked.

 Earlier, Dunlop India had submitted two schemes with the help of Tata Economic Consultancy Services. SBI is the operating agency of Dunlop. However, Balakrishnan has made it clear that reopening of both Sahagunj and Ambattur factories will depend on reducing the manpower.

 The Centre and the Bengal government had called for joint meetings with the companys representative and the authorities concerned to take stock of the present state of its revival. The company has submitted lists of relief, concessions and waivers it seeks from these authorities. The concessions will also be included in the new DRS, which is being formulated.

 The company had entered into an agreement with the unions of the Ambattur factory to reopen the plant.

 However, the agreement could not be implemented as the DRS has not been cleared, Balakrishnan added.

 Shareholders today approved the appointment of executive director Deepak Chaudhury to look after the daily operations of the company. He looks after the manufacturing of Falcon tyres.

 Back on BSE

 Nearly 35,000 retail shareholders of Dunlop India may start trading in the companys shares within the next two months. 

 We have cleared the dues of the stock exchanges so that trading can begin in Dunlop India stocks. We also plan to delist our shares from many exchanges across the country. The shares should be listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and one or two other bourses, Balakrishnan said.

 Dunlop India, which was a B-1 category stock, has been placed under the Z-group by the BSE. The Z-category stocks denote lack of regulatory compliance by firms. The Dunlop India scrip has been suspended by the BSE. The last trading took place on April 15, 2002.

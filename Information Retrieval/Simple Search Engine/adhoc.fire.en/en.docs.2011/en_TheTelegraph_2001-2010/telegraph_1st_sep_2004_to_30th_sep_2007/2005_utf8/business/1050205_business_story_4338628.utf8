 Calcutta, Feb. 4: Hindustan Motors (HM) today launched a Lancer variant with a lower price tag, featuring the Mitsubishi logo more prominently, to improve sales.

 The company has also finalised plans to introduce a ?D? segment premium car model from the Mitsubishi stable in 2005. A new model of the Pajero sport utility vehicle (SUV) might also hit the roads this year to garner a bigger market share in the growing car sales segment, HM vice-president S. C. Gupta said.

 The price range of the new-look Lancer varies from Rs 6.93 lakh to Rs 7.9 lakh, depending on the features, with diesel models at the top end. The previous price range was Rs 7.5-9.4 lakh.

 The company hopes to double Lancer sales to about 6000 units in 2005 against about 3000 units last year, Gupta said.

 The new model will sport the Mitsubishi logo on the centre of the steering wheel and on all four wheels, in addition to the front and rear of the car, to drive home the power of the Japanese stable.

 Lancer, the first C-segment car from HM-Mitsubishi stable launched in India in 1998, started off with an annual sales of over 12,000 cars even when it was priced at upward of Rs 8.5 lakh. However, as the segment got crowded with most car makers introducing different international models, its number had gradually come down to just about 3,000 last year.

 Gupta said the price of the car was lowered following a 72 per cent localisation of components and general reduction in costs. ?We only passed on the benefit of localisation to our customers,? he said, refusing to agree that prices were reduced to stay in competition. According to Gupta, prices of select vital components had gone down by as much as 56 per cent.

 Rupee scare singes stocks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 18: Tuesday was a bad day for domestic financial markets. The rupee slipped to a 11-month low of 45.17 against the dollar. And shaken by the currencys fall, the sensex swung in a range of 249 points before ending with a loss of 80.37 points at 8122.25.

 The Indian currencys plunge was triggered by the appreciation of the greenback against the euro and the yen in overseas markets. 

 The fall was hastened by exporters increased dollar demand. It was exacerbated by worries that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) would step up sales. 

 The yawning trade deficit and adverse arbitrage facility in the world market also quicken the pace of the slide.

 The rupee had fallen below the 45-mark on November 10 last year, to 45.18. But since the beginning of this year, the Indian currency rallied against the greenback. 

 That continued until a few weeks back, but the rupee has now come under pressure as the dollar has been appreciating against other major currencies. 

 The shrinking FII investment in stocks ? to stash away the dollars abroad ? has also contributed to weakness. 

 On Monday, the foreign institutional investors were net sellers to the tune of $68 million on the bourses. 

 On Tuesday, the rupee opened lower at 44.97 compared with Mondays close of 44.89 and plumbed the days low at 45.19. However, it recovered during the dying hours of the session to finish at 45.17, reflecting a steep loss of 28 paise over its last close.

 There was no helping hand in the form of a Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervention. The central bank preferred not to step in through dollar sales by state-run banks.

 There were various factors that contributed to the rupees decline, said Sanjeev Gupta, chief dealer at Centurion Bank. 

 Apart from the overseas gains made by the dollar, conditions in the stock market, the widening trade deficit and non-deliverable forward (NDF) related arbitrage put the rupee on slippery ground, he explained.

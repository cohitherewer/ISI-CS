 Green signal for fare freeze

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: First the good news: there will be no increase in passenger fares.

 Railway minister Laloo Yadav ? who is in the thick of an election battle to protect his fief in Bihar ? is getting ready to roll out another populist budget. 

 However, Laloo could find his largesse somewhat circumscribed: he is being forced to desist from introducing any new trains. 

 In exchange, the finance ministry and Planning Commission mandarins are offering the railway minister budgetary support of over Rs 10,000 crore, the right to float special bonds, and the freedom to introduce a high-speed rail corridor along the golden quadrilateral that connects the four major metropolises ? Delhi, Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai. 

 The last time railway passenger fares were raised was in 2002-03 when Nitish Kumar was the railway minister. 

 The babus of the Planning Commission, finance ministry and railway ministry today had a brainstorming session on the railway budget before Thursdays meeting between Laloo and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 

 But everyone knows Laloo is irrepressible which is why Railway Board officials said the minister could still pull off a surprise, despite the agreement between the bureaucrats today, when he presents his second budget in the Lok Sabha on Saturday. 

 Sources in the railway ministry said the meeting was to discuss the five-year integrated railway modernisation plan. The meeting also discussed the Tenth Plan expenditure of Rs 25,000 crore on railway modernisation and a proposal to raise separate bonds or divert a part of the money raised from the proposed infrastructure bonds to the railways. 

 The issue of hike in passenger tariff and rationalisation of freight tariff were taken up at the meeting. 

 The finance ministry and Planning Commission officials impressed upon the Railway Board chairman R. K. Singh the need for a moderate increase in passenger fares and a rationalisation of rail freight rates which would ensure that Laloo would not have to look outside for funds. 

 A senior Railway board member said, ?The Railway Board chairman cannot make any commitments as the minister will have to be taken into confidence. We will take note of the observation made by all concerned in the meetings that have been held till date on preparation of the railway budget. The final authority is the railway minister.? 

 ?Fares, both passenger and freight are a sensitive subject. We have to balance between the roadways and the airlines. We are at it,? the member said. 

 The railways faces a tough task in holding on to its higher-class passengers who have been switching over to airlines because of the low fares there. It is also fighting to keep its commercial customers from transporting their goods by trucks because of the high railway freight. 

 Sources said the railway minister may not be able to push all his wish list since the minister, who had been camping for more than month now in Bihar as part of the assembly elections, was not able to lobby with the finance ministry and the Prime Minister.

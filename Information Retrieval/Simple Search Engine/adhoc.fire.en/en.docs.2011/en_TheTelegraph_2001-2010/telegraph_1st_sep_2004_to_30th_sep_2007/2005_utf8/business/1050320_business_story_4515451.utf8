 Deadline set for rich to cut subsidies

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nath: Strong stand

 New Delhi, March 19: The Group of 20 (G-20) developing nations today formally sought complete elimination of export subsidies given by the US, European Union and Japan to their farmers within five years.

 The G-20 unanimously endorsed what has been dubbed as the New Delhi Declaration, which also calls on developed nations to significantly reduce trade-distorting domestic support to their farmers. 

 The declaration assumes significance as it also has the support of poor countries outside the G-20 such as the group of least developed nations and Africa-Caribbean-Pacific countries. 

 The coming together of as many as 120 delegates to back the cause of poor farmers marks a major victory over attempts of the West to split this block. The declaration rejects the move of western countries to categorise developing countrys into different groups based on size and degrees of backwardness. 

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath said at a joint press conference after the meeting that G-20 represents 72 per cent of world?s farmers and 65 per cent of the world?s population. These poor farmers cannot compete with the artificial low prices at which farmers from rich nations dump subsidy-supported agricultural goods. 

 He said G-20 was in favour of a world trade order that was fair and just to all nations. The system should evolve through a process of consensus where all countries have a say rather than an individual nation or select group of countries setting the rules of the game.

 Brazilian external affairs minister and G 20 co-ordinator Celso Amorim said the two-day brainstorming session had been very useful and underscored the ?convergence? between the developing countries. 

 He said G-20 should be in a state of ?permanent mobilisation? for WTO talks. ?There may be points of differences on nuances but G-20 is solid like a rock and represents unity in diversity,? he said.

 The five-page declaration highlights the fact that a solution to agricultural issues would stimulate progress in other areas of WTO talks such as market access of non-agricultural goods and the services sector. 

 The paper chalks out the position of the G-20 nations in the final run-up to the WTO ministerial to be held in Hong Kong in December. The declaration is opposed to any attempt to reduce the minimum support that developing nations extend to poor farmers for their essential livelihood.

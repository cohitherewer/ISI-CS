 Evolvence launches mother of funds

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Calcutta, April 24: The Dubai-based Evolvence Capital has launched the first international fund of funds for India ? Evolvence India Fund.

 ?This is the first global independent private equity fund of funds,? Evolvence India Fund general partner Jagannathan V told The Telegraph.

 The fund has set an investment target of $250 million and aims to invest through six to seven different fund managers within the country. While an equity fund invests directly in various companies across sectors, a fund of fund invests in these direct equity funds.

 ?GW Capital is one of our fund managers, the equity fund of which has already been closed. However, we cannot disclose the identity of other fund managers as all of them are still open,? said Jagannathan.

 GW Capital invests in growing middle-market companies in India and has interests in sectors such as healthcare, information technology and outsourced services, biotechnology, media and entertainment.

 Evolvence India will invest in the complete gamut of sectors and companies through the private equity route such as automobiles, textiles and various service-oriented sectors. The other major sectors in which the fund would explore possibilities are infrastructure and real estate.

 ?We have been looking at India for the last 18 months and had targeted a universe of 25 fund managers in the country. Of the 25, we have shortlisted six,? said Jagannathan.

 Evolvence Capital has been studying the emerging countries and after close deliberations, chose India as its investment destination.

 ?India presents a unique opportunity and emerged as the most suitable choice based on a risk-reward matrix and in terms of growth and development,? said Jagannathan.

 ?We are extremely excited about the prospects of India and are especially enthusiastic about the service-oriented industry model followed and implemented in the country,? Jagannathan added.

 Evolvence Capital is owned by 10 high net worth families spread across the Gulf and is the arm that identifies alternative investment products. It invests globally and has private equity, real estate and hedge funds.

 The total investment of the firm (excluding Evolvence India) is $700 million, with the maximum investments in the West Asian countries.

 ?With the Evolvence India Fund, India will be the largest investment destination of the firm,? added Jagannathan.

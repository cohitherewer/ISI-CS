 Sensex set to breach 7000

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Mumbai, June 19: Marketmen expect Reliance Industries, ITC, Hind Lever and State Bank to propel the Bombay Stock Exchange sensex past the 7000-mark on Monday. 

 If it happens, it will be this week, maybe even tomorrow, an analyst said. However, some are unsure whether the sensex will stay above the key threshold for long. 

 It could be a sentiment-driven market tomorrow, a prominent broker said. According to him, the settlement of the dispute between the Ambani brothers will set the tone for the rally. 

 Whatever happened last week are good signals for the markets. The first monsoon shower in the city coincided with the Ambani brothers announcing the settlement of their differences on ownership issues, he added.

 However, some are of the opinion that the markets have already discounted the news of the settlement as the media has been speculating about it for all of last week.

 ITC also looks bullish after the bonus issue and stock split, and so does fast moving consumer goods major Hindustan Lever, analysts said. State Bank chairman A K Purwars indication that the largest commercial bank may look at merging its associate banks is likely to attract investors attention towards the SBI counter when the market opens tomorrow. 

 RIL has a weightage of 10.68 per cent in the BSE sensex. The company enjoys a market capitalisation that is 4.57 per cent of the total shareholders wealth. ITC represents 6 percent of the sensex, while HLL and SBI weighs 3.8 per cent each in the share price index.

 Another scrip that will be eagerly watched tomorrow is the Reliance Energy, which has a little over 1 per cent weightage in the sensex. The fact that Anil Ambani is planning to invest over Rs 1,000 crore in Reliance Energy at close to market rates will instil confidence in investors on the company, analysts opined.

 Though the markets had an inkling of the settlement of ownership issues within the Reliance group, it will be the first time on Monday that investors will be trading with the knowledge of the full details on the deal between the two brothers. 

 The Reliance scrip had touched a high of Rs 608.40 on Friday before closing at Rs 601. Shareholders stand to gain more because, in addition to holding shares in Reliance Industries, they will also hold shares in the new holding company formed as the special purpose vehicle.

 Further, each of the two brothers will have a point to prove to the shareholders for themselves and may go out of the way to appease them in the future. Each of them is likely to give transparency and corporate governance issues more importance than ever before.

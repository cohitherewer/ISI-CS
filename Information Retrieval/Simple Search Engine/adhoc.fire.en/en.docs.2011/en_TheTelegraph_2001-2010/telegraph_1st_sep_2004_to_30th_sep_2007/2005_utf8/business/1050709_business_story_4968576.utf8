 Sale pill prescribed for comatose PSUs

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, July 8: The government has decided to auction loss-making public sector units (PSU) in the market to strategic buyers, but with safeguards against asset stripping and indiscriminate retrenchment of labour.

 According to a position paper framed by the finance ministry and circulated to key ministries, a sick state-owned company will be sold if it faces technological obsolescence or lacks the scale to be competitive.

 As a norm, no strategic sale of profitable PSUs will generally take place, though share sales through the market will continue. 

 Senior finance ministry officials see the paper as a signal that the government has made up its mind not buckling under Left pressures to abandon stake sales in firms like Bhel. At the same time, attempts to bring in safeguards in case of strategic sales have been made in view of concerns voiced by Left leaders in the past, they said.

 However, they added the term used in the paper is generally ? this is being regarded as an intentional insertion. If we feel a profit-making PSU is likely to turn sick as a result of changing market conditions or loss of its monopoly status, we will certainly consider auctioning it off to a strategic buyer, an official said, adding there was significant political will behind such a decision.

 In case of strategic sales, the paper says besides the price offered, new selection conditions will be brought in. These will cover the level of investment to be brought in, minimum turnover and minimum employment levels that the strategic buyer intends to maintain. 

 There will also be safeguards against asset stripping and indiscriminate retrenchment of labour for a fixed period of time. 

 Officials point out that in several sales ? Balco, Modern Food and VSNL are cited as examples ? workers were retrenched and assets sold off or transferred soon after the company was taken over by a new owner.

 The inclusion of so many conditions will make the task of evaluating bids more complex, but it will help the government monitor compliance with shareholders agreement over a period of at least three years. 

 It would be the responsibility of directors nominated by the government to monitor whether the strategic partner has honoured the commitment made in pacts signed at the time of the sale. These would cover curbs on asset stripping, stated the note.

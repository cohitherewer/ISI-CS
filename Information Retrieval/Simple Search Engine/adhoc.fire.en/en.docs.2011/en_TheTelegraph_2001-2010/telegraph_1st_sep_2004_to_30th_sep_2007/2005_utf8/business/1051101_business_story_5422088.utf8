 Come November 3, the Orissa government, which has so far signed 37 Memoranda of Understanding (MoU) with steel and alumina companies for setting up their units in the state, would ink seven more. 

 The consent letters to this effect have already been issued to the companies after the high-level committee cleared their proposals, official sources said. The companies include Jindal Steel amp; Power Ltd, Bhushan Steel amp; Strips, Rungta Mines, State Steel India, Brand Alloys, Jaya Balaji Jyoti Steels and Eastern Steel amp; Power. The committee chaired by chief secretary Subash Pani had last week cleared the proposals of Jindal Steel and Bhushan Steel.

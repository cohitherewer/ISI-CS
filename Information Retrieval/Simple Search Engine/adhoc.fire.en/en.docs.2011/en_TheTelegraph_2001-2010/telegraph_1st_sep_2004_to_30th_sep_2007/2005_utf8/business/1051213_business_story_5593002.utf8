 Calcutta, Dec. 12: Finally, the city gets a mall for steel, courtesy Tata Steel.

 The country?s premier steel maker today launched steeljunction, a mall exclusively retailing steel products, thereby kick-starting its much talked about foray into steel retailing.

 Spread over 20,000 sq. ft, steeljunction is a speciality store selling a wide range of steel products. The store, inaugurated today by Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman, is the first of its kind in India.

 ?We have pioneered steel making in India. Now we are making an effort to popularise the usage of steel in the country,? Muthuraman said.

 The Calcutta store is a pilot project from the company. It plans to set up a few more across the country.

 ?We will be monitoring the progress of this mall and use the experience gained from here to develop a model for other such stores,? Sumit Ray, chief (retail initiatives), Tata Steel, said.

 Alongside home construction and maintenance products, the store also sells lifestyle steel products. 

 Besides Tata Steel, steeljunction showcases items from other steel makers, too. So far it has got some 20 vendors displaying their products. A number of Chinese products have also found their ways into the store. 

 Initially, other steel makers were reluctant to bring their products to steeljunction. However, they have now realised the prospect of the format. 

 ?The mall benefits all the steel companies,? said T. Mukherjee, deputy managing director (steel), Tata Steel. ?I have received calls even today from people who want to be part of steeljunction,? Ray chipped in.

 Tata Steel has a number of properties elsewhere that could be developed into a steeljunction store.

 India?s per capita consumption of steel is way below of the world average. ?The usage of steel is very low in our country given the limited application of it. Hopefully, steeljunction will change the rule of the game,? Muthuraman said.

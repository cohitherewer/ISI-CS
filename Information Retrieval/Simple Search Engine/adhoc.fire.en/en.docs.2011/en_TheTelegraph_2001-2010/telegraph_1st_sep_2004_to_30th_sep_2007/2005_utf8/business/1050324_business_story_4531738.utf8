 Patents tonic for drug firms

 New Delhi, March 23: The new patent act Parliament passed yesterday has made two major changes to the earlier bill. It introduces limits on the kind of medicines that can be patented and allows Indian firms to contest patent applications by multinationals far more effectively. 

 Although the CPM claimed the changes to be its brainchild, industry lobbyists put them down to successful campaigning by Indian drug firms. 

 The new patent regime makes stricter the definition of what can be patented. Only molecules which are truly new developments, and not those which are minor changes to the original, will be allowed to be patented. And that, too, only those that have been discovered after 1995.

 Copies of older discoveries, even if the latter are now patented, can continue to be sold. This is a change Indian firms are happy with. Ranbaxy, the country?s largest drug maker, feels there will be no major price impact in the short run. ?Not many drugs are expected to go out of the market because of the patent act,? said Ramesh Adige, a director of Ranbaxy. 

 Adige and other analysts feel some price stability will prevail as new molecules will be few and far between. However, new drugs that are patented here would not have any cheaper clones and could be priced high.

 ?Eventually there will be a dual kind of market. There will be a handful of molecules that will have patent. These will be expensive but there will be other drugs which are generic or are therapeutical equivalents which will be cheaper,? said Rajiv Gulati, managing director of Eli Lilly India Limited, the Indian arm of a US multinational.

 The other change ? related to the option to contest frivolous patent applications by multinationals ? is also something firms like Ranbaxy and Dr Reddy?s are happy with. Indian firms can now oppose patent applications on nine grounds instead of two and can do so in person. 

 ?The pre-grant (of patent) opposition to patents has been strengthened in the bill and that is a very positive safeguard to avoid misuse of the law,? said Adige.

 Multinationals are not very happy with the government?s decision to allow only those molecules which have been discovered after 1995 to be patented. ?It?s a retrograde feature,? said Gulati.

 Swati Piramal, director and chief scientific officer of Nicholas Piramal India, believes the act will pave the way for more ?cross-border alliances and foreign collaborations, especially in research?.

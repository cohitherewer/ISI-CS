The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Call for direct selling norms

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 26: The Indian Direct Sellers Association (IDSA) is in talks with the government to create a regulatory framework for the direct selling industry to wipe out grey players in the segment.

 The association is studying the regulatory framework in the UK where legislation has helped the industry grow. Direct selling is a $69-billion industry globally with 50 million sales personnel. The industry has generated employment opportunities for over 6000 people over the last few years.

 Manoj Shirodkar, chairman of IDSA and country director of Herbal Life India, said, We are negotiating with the consumer affairs and commerce ministries to create guidelines that will help regulate the Rs 2400-crore direct selling industry. This will also encourage investments from global companies operating in this segment.

 According to Shirodkar, another major area of concern is the emergence of pyramid companies or unscrupulous players. These companies operate mainly on recruitment-based schemes rather than a sales-based strategy.

 Direct selling is expected to grow to a Rs 30,000-crore industry in the next few years with employment opportunities for 15 million people, added Shirodkar. However, the presence of pyramid companies are restricting investment flow into India and also hampering growth.

 The industry is expected to grow by 30 per cent this year. India has also become a hub for direct selling agents in neighbouring countries.

 Direct selling companies currently reach out to 2500 towns and cities with 200 company-owned outlets and over 500 stockist centres.

 Procter quarterly profit rises

 Chicago, Aug. 1 (Reuters): Procter amp; Gamble Co, whose product lineup includes Crest toothpaste and Pampers diapers, on Monday reported a 9.5 per cent increase in quarterly profit, lead by strong growth in its beauty and health care units.

 Earnings rose to $1.5 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended June 30.

 Analysts on average expected P amp;G, which plans to acquire Gillette Co later this year, to earn 55 cents per share.

 Net sales rose 10 per cent to $14.26 billion, while analysts had expected revenue of $14.04 billion.

 The Cincinnati-based company had expected growth at a high single-digit percentage rate. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange rate movements, it said organic sales were up 9 per cent.

 Unit volume grew 6 per cent.

 P amp;G and other consumer products makers have been trimming expenses and raising prices to mitigate the effects of rising commodity and raw material costs. 

 Higher prices added 2 per cent to sales growth, the company said.

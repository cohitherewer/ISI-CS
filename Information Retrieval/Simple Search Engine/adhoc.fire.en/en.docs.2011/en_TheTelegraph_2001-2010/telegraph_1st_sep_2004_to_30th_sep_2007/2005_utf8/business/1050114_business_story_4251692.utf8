 Unified telecom licence to cost Rs 107 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan 13: The cost of a unified telecom licence has been fixed at Rs 107 crore.

 Telecom operators who aspire to offer the full suite of telecom services ? fixed-line, cellular, domestic and international long distance telephony, Internet telephony, cable TV, direct-to-home (DTH) TV and broadcasting services and global mobile personal communications by satellite (GMPCS) ?will now need to cough up this amount if the government accepts the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India?s (Trai) recommendations that were submitted today.

 The licence will also cover what are known as class services like mobile radio trunking, V-SAT and network services.

 Telecom operators will also have to fork out a revenue share of 6 per cent of their adjusted gross revenues when they migrate to the new dispensation.

 Telecom operators who want to offer fixed-line services as part of the unified licence will have to pay an additional amount, which will be calculated on the basis of a formula that takes into account the entry fee paid by a basic operator who entered the scene before 2001 (see chart).

 The new regime will also lift the current restrictions on Internet telephony business. At present, Internet-based calls are allowed from a computer to a phone. This requires you to actually go to a cybercafe to make calls. 

 Under the new regime, customers will be able to make Internet calls from their fixed-line phones at home by dialling into an Internet telephony service. 

 India will then join a group of more than 80 countries that allow full-scale Internet telephony. 

 The telecom regulator has submitted its recommendations on the unified licensing regime to the communications ministry. The government is likely to take a decision this week. With the full implementation of unified licensing, the service-specific licensing regime will end. 

 Trai has suggested four categories of licences with a unified licence at the top of the heap. This will be followed by three other licences which will allow telecom operators to offer one or a combination of services.

 The regulator has recommended slashing the revenue share from 15 per cent to 6 per cent of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) in the new regime.

 At present, the migration to unified licensing regime is optional for the operators. However, after five years of implementation, it will be mandatory for all telecom operators to migrate to the new regime. The total registration charge shall be gradually reduced from the recommended level of Rs 107 crore to Rs 30 lakh after five years.

 The key objective of the unified licensing regime is to encourage free growth of new applications and services, leveraging on the technological developments in information and communication technology (ICT).

 Other important objectives include simplifying telecom licensing, flexible and efficient utilisation of resources and application of technological developments, encouraging niche operators in rural and remote areas, ensuring easy entry, level playing field, and ?no-worse off? situation for the existing operators.

 Trai said the proposed reduction in regulatory costs and the possibility of bundling of various services (wireline or wireless) is aimed to help the customer get all kinds of telecom services at affordable prices.

 The regulator said the unified licence aims to allow ?niche operators? (definition of niche operators is be finalised later by the regulator) to offer other telecom services in rural areas.

 Under the unified licence, there will be no restriction on the usage of Internet telephony or other Internet protocol (IP) enabled services. Niche operators will also be allowed to offer Internet telephony.

 Stand-alone licences for broadcasting services would continue to be issued by the information and broadcasting ministry.

 If a unified licensee wants to offer ?broadcasting service?, the licensee will have to apply to the information and broadcasting ministry, in case such clearance is required, and fulfil other requirements as prescribed. The content in any case, would be regulated by the information and broadcasting ministry. 

 Cell firms unhappy

 Cellular operators have expressed disappointment over Trai?s recommendations, saying they were not significantly different from the draft that the regulator had issued earlier. 

 ?We do not see anything significantly different from the draft recommendations on unified licensing issued earlier. Nothing is radically different from that. We had earlier stated that Rs 107 crore for long-distance services is rather high. It is unjust as well,? T. V. Ramachandran of Cellular Operators Association of India said. 

 To increase the penetration of telecom services in rural areas, niche operators will be allowed in taluks with fixed rural teledensity below 1, providing fixed telecom services, including multimedia Internet telephony and other IP enabled services. These operators will, however, be permitted to use only wireline/fixed wireless networks.

 Till the government issues spectrum guidelines, based on Trai?s recommendations (currently under finalisation), existing spectrum pricing and allocation process will continue.

 The regulator is targeting to speed up telecom services in rural areas and is likely to propose a nil/low spectrum charge for niche operators.

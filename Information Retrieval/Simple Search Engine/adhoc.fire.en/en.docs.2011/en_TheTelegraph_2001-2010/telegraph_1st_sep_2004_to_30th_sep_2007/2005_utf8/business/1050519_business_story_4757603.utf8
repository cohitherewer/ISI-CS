 Bengal lobbies for more SSI loans 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Dasgupta: Helping hand

 Calcutta, May 18: The Bengal government has urged banks to disburse more loans to small-scale units.

 We had approached the Reserve Bank of India to direct the banks to give more loans to the small-scale units in Bengal and the deputy governor of the central bank has agreed to co-operate with us, state finance minister Asim Dasgupta said at a seminar organised by the Federation of Small and Medium Industries (Fosmi).

 We have urged the banks to double the loan disbursement amount this fiscal from Rs 750 crore last year, added Dasgupta.

 He said bank deposits in Bengal aggregate to Rs 90,000 crore. However, not even 50 per cent of that amount is disbursed within the state compared with more than 60 per cent in other states, he added.

 On the implementation of VAT, Dasgupta said, Various commodities may have been wrongly classified under the heads of 550 items. These are being currently reclassified.

 He added that in the next quarterly review of the VAT committee, procedural problems, if any, will be considered and addressed.

 On the negative impact of VAT resulting in price escalation of consumer goods, Dasgupta said, The maximum retail price of the packaged items has not factored in the new VAT rates as the traders are clearing their old stocks. We have instructed the manufacturers to revise the prices within three weeks. Thus, within a fortnight, there will be a reduction in prices.

 We are also trying to come out of the financial problems faced by most states, said Dasgupta. Last year, the state had disbursed Rs 8 crore of the total fund of Rs 40 crore as capital investment subsidy. 

 We have decided to disburse the remaining Rs 32 crore in the current year. Also, Rs 17 crore to the handlooms and Rs 15 crore to the development of clusters will be disbursed in the current fiscal, he added.

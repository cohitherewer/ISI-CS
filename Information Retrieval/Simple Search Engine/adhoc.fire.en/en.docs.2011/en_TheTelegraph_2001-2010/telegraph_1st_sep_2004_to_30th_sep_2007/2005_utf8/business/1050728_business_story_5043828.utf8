 Nath allays investors? fears over ?freak? Honda row

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Nath: Still a smooth ride

 New Delhi, July 27: India today said labour unrest in Gurgaon, involving a Japanese multinational, was an ?isolated? and ?local? incident, which would not shake investors? confidence.

 Expressing anguish over the clash between Honda Motors? employees and police in Gurgaon, commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath said: ?We do not believe that it is a pattern. This is an isolated and freak incident and should not be politicised.?

 ?It (labour unrest) will not in anyway affect investors confidence,? he said.

 On Tuesday, the Japanese ambassador to India Y Enoki had expressed concern over the incident and stated that the flow of foreign funds into India could be hit as a result. 

 Nath said India continued to be a safe and investor-friendly country with tremendous potential for growth.

 Contradicting the Japanese ambassador, the minister said the flow of foreign investments from Japan would in no way be hit because of this incident.

 Nath had detailed discussion with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Haryana chief minister Bhupender Singh Hooda about the incident. The Prime Minister had expressed concerned over the incident, he added.

 The minister said he had not heard of any Japanese company threatening to pull out of India. India and Japan have long-standing trade and investment relations and as many as 250 Japanese companies had invested $2 billion in equity in about 300 locations in India since 1991, he said.

 There are many joint ventures in India between leading Japanese and Indian companies. Suzukis joint venture with Maruti in Gurgaon is a successful Indo-Japanese collaboration, he added. Japan is the fourth largest investor in India. 

 FDI inflows

 According to the minister, FDI in the country had more than doubled during April-May of this fiscal to touch $912 million compared with the corresponding figure of $421 million for the same period last year.

 The minister said he expected FDI during the current fiscal to be in excess of $6-7 billion, which would be 42 per cent higher than last years figure of $3.75 billion.

 Destination India

 Nath said studies undertaken by a number of international organisations have highlighted the attractiveness of India as an investment destination. AT Kearney FDI confidence index 2004 rated India as the third most attractive FDI destination and Unctad found India along with the US and China to be the top three ?investment hot spots?, he said.

 World Bank?s study had placed India among the top 10 reformers in 2003 and, in a recent survey, industry body Ficci found that 77 per cent of foreign companies were making profits and another 9 per cent were breaking even, he said. ?This reflects the attractive investment climate in India,? he said, adding, ?One isolated incident, though most unfortunate, should not be a yardstick for assessment of industrial relations in India.?

 Labour laws

 The government today said it was in favour of labour law reforms that not only protect the existing jobs, but also create new employment opportunities. ?So far the labour laws have concentrated in protecting jobs. Reforms should be such that they not only protected the existing jobs, but created new ones as well, quot; Nath said. 

 Meanwhile, bankers declared they would go on strike tomorrow in Gurgaon district in sympathy with the Honda workers.

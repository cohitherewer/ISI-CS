 Harrahs seals Caesars deal for $6.8 billion

 Los Angeles, June 14 (Reuters): Harrahs Entertainment Inc on Monday closed its $6.8-billion purchase of rival Caesars Entertainment, creating the worlds largest casino operator and upping its bet on Las Vegas.

 Chief executive Gary Loveman said Harrahs has its eye on long-term opportunities in overseas gaming, but near-term growth will likely come from its hometown of Las Vegas.

 The combined company has nearly 100,000 employees and $9 billion in annual revenue from 40 properties, including riverboats and hotel-casinos in 12 states and three countries.

 Harrahs offer, which included $1.9 billion in cash and $4.9 billion in Harrahs shares, was first announced last July.

 Harrahs now controls 6 Las Vegas properties, compared with the 10 resorts owned by No. 2 gambling company MGM Mirage, which in April acquired Mandalay Resort Group and narrowed the industry to two major players.

 A record 37.4 million tourists and conventioneers visited the US gambling mecca last year and analysts expect the numbers to rise as ageing baby boomers spend their time and money on leisure travel.

 We have 40 million American adults in our database. We can offer them everything from the luxury of Caesars Palace to the more affordable Flamingo. Once they arrive, we will have six properties within walking distance of each other, Loveman said.

 He said Harrahs was looking at options for expansion in Las Vegas, including opening a casino under its high-end Horseshoe brand or another property under its namesake Harrahs brand.

 Loveman said the government of Singapore is likely to issue in about a month a final request for proposals for two proposed casino projects, after which bidders will have three months to respond.

 He said Harrahs is also looking at opportunities in the Chinese gambling enclave of Macau, although nothing has been defined. We have to find a legal entry point, Loveman said. Harrahs also will pursue gaming opportunitys in Britain, where the government has cleared the way for a single Las Vegas-style casino, as well as in Spain, the CEO said.

 Elsewhere in the United States, Harrahs is expanding operations in Pennsylvania and expects gaming to eventually be approved in New England states, Loveman said.

 The Harrahs-Caesars merger was approved last week by the Federal Trade Commission and gaming regulators in Nevada, following earlier approval by regulators in New Jersey, Louisiana, Mississippi and Indiana.

 Caesars shares fell 18 per cent on Monday to about the level of Harrahs cash offer for each Caesars share. Harrahs offered Caesars shareholders cash or stock in its own company, with caps on both stock and cash payouts.

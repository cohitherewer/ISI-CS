 Jet hires US firm to fight slur case 

 Mumbai, June 12 (PTI): Jet Airways has hired American law firm Paul Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton amp; Garrison, to initiate legal proceedings against US Jet Airways Inc, which had accused it of having terrorist links.

 In a statement here today, Jet Airways executive director S. K. Dutta said: Martin London, a partner in the litigation department of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton amp; Garrison, will lead the legal team on behalf of Jet in the matter.

 The release said Nancy Heckerman, president and CEO of Maryland-based Jet Airways Inc, had made allegations regarding alleged links of Jet Airways (India) Ltd with undesirables in a letter of objection to the US department of transportation.

 The primary motivation of Jet Airways Inc in filing the objection arises out of a trade name registered by them in 2004 that is currently being addressed before the US patent and trademark office. Jet Airways Inc has no airline operating permit and no planes either, it said.

 Jet Airways has filed additional documents with the US authorities in response to the objections raised by the Maryland-based company.

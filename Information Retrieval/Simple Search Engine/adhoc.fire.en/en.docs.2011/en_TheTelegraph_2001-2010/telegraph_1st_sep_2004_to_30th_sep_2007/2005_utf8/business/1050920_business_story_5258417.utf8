 Czech firm plans local unit

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Calcutta, Sept. 19: ZKL Bearings CZ Ltd, a $60-million Czech engineering firm, is keen on setting up a joint venture production unit in Bengal with its city-based trading partner, ZKL Bearings India.

 The Prague-based company is planning to hold 80 per cent equity in the Indian outfit by way of supplying plant, machinery as well as cash.

 ZKL has decided to shift production out of Europe as the cost of manufacturing has gone up by over 30 per cent in the EU member nations, said Jiri Prasil, ZKL president and managing director. 

 Cost escalation has taken place on three fronts ? labour, power and the currency has also appreciated, he said.

 The company also has production units in Germany, Yugoslavia, France and Slovakia. Prasil and director Vladimir Hradek have come down to finalise the details with ZKL Bearings India.

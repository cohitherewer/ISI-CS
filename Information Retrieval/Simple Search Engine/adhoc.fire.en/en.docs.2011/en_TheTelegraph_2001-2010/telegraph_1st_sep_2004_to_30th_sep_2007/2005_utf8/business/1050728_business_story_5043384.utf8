 Airbus parent on right course

 Frankfurt, July 27 (Reuters): European aerospace and defence group EADSs new co-chiefs pledged to deliver on 2005 growth targets on Wednesday after reporting a sharp rise in first-half operating profit, boosted by its Airbus unit.

 EADS confirmed it was confident of reaching its full-year forecast for operating profit to exceed 2.6 billion euros ($3.14 billion) and sales to reach 33 billion euros.

 But it raised its target for full-year earnings per share (EPS) to 1.50 euros from 1.36 euros. This compares with 1.27 euros in 2004. EADS is set to deliver strong group-wide performance for the full year, co-chief executives Tom Enders and Noel Forgeard said in a joint statement.

 Much attention had been focusing on whether the new top management team ? installed last month following a nine-month power struggle at the Franco-German-Spanish group ? would use its first results publication to boost earnings forecasts.

 Its a good sign, one Frankfurt analyst said of the decision to lift the EPS forecast now instead of waiting until after the third quarter.

 The worlds second-largest aerospace group posted a 57 per cent rise in first-half operating earnings before interest, tax and amortisation to 1.54 billion euros, driven mainly by increased deliveries at commercial aircraft unit Airbus.

 Overall group net profit more than doubled to 816 million euros on sales up 10 per cent at 16 billion euros. 

 The figures look very good, said the analyst. Its definitely better than expectations.

 Analysts had expected a 50 per cent rise in the operating result to just below 1.5 billion euros, according to the average of forecasts by several major brokers.

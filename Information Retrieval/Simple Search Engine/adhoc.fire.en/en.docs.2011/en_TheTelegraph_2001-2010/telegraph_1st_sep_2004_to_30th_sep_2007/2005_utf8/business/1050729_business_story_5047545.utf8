 Graphite set to expand

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 28: Graphite India Ltd is expanding its domestic and German facility.

 The KK Bangur-owned company is increasing the capacity of graphite products at home to 60,000 tonnes from 40,000 tonnes at present.

 At the same time, the company will double the capacity of the newly-acquired German facility to 20,000 tonnes.

 Graphite India is spending about Rs 160 crore at home, while another Rs 20 crore will be pumped in Germany.

 The expanded capacity in India will be operational this quarter, while the German plan will be finalised in the next three months.

 The expanded capacity would translate into a sharp rise in the topline, chairman K.K. Bangur said on the sidelines of the companys 13th annual general meeting.

 In India, it would give us Rs 250 crore of additional sales annually. On the other hand, the extra capacity in Germany will mean another Rs 180-200-crore business, he added.

 Last financial year, the companys consolidated net income was Rs 573.56 crore. After the expanded capacity becomes operational, the topline will be close to Rs 1,000 crore.

 In India, the company will ramp up capacity at the Durgapur plant from 14,000 mt to 34,000 mt. Bangur is also bullish on the price realisation from graphite. Our capacities are booked till December at $2,500 a tonne. However, in the spot market, it is quoting at $4,000 a tonne, he said.

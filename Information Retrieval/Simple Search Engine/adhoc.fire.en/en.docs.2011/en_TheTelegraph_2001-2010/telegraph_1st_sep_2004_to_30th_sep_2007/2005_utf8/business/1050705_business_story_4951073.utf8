 Deutsche Tele weighs options for US business

 Users choice

 Frankfurt, July 4 (Reuters): Deutsche Telekom has been sounding out institutional investors on whether to sell off US mobile operator T-Mobile USA or spend billions of dollars to expand the business, according to fund managers. 

 Deutsche Telekom and T-Mobile USA officials declined to comment on what they called market rumours. 

 In a series of one-on-one meetings with investment funds, chief financial officer Karl-Gerhard Eick and other executives of Europes biggest phone carrier told fund managers a decision would be made by the year-end. 

 But many investors are sceptical a buyer will emerge and question whether there was a sensible way to spend the $30 billion Deutsche Telekom could raise in a sale, and hope T-Mobile USA might need less investment if it goes on its own. 

 There were several meetings with Eick in which they were testing what our reaction would be, said one fund manager at a major German fund who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The meetings happened around March, he said. 

 A fund manager at another major German fund, who also declined to be named, confirmed that options for the US mobile business were discussed earlier this year. 

 They said there would be a period of uncertainty (until the end of the year), and that we would have to trust them to make the right decision, the second investor added. 

 One option that Eick presented to investors was to sell the fast-growing business, bought for $40 billion during the peak of the telecoms bubble, while it was still on a good run, signing up subscribers fast, and boosting sales and earnings. The second scenario was to buy permits for third-generation (3G) mobile phone services in auctions next year and build a 3G network for such services.

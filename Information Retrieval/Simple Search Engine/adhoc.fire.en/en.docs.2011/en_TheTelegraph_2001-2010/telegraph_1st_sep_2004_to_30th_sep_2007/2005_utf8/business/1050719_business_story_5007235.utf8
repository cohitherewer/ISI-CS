 OVL may get more financial autonomy

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, July 18: The government may give ONGC-Videsh financial autonomy for any single investment up to Rs 2,000 crore. It is also considering a plan to allow Oil Indias proposed foreign arm freedom to independently spend up to Rs 1,000 crore on aggressive overseas acquisitions. 

 The government has based its decisions on the suggestions of the advisory committee on synergy in energy. At present, ONGC-Videsh (OVL) is free to spend up to Rs 300 crore only, beyond which it has to get an approval from the committee of secretaries and finally the cabinet. 

 The committee has pointed out that quick decisions are essential for overseas acquisitions of hydrocarbon assets and it would be necessary to simplify the existing procedures and empower OVL to clinch major deals.

 It suggests that OVL and the proposed foreign arm of Oil India Ltd, called Oil India Videsh Ltd (OIVL), should be given the flexibility to incorporate a company as subsidiary or joint venture in foreign countries without a ceiling on the investments when they succeed in acquiring an oil or gas asset. 

 The committee is in favour of granting sweeping financial powers to the two companies as it feels India needs to aggressively continue participating in overseas exploration and production so as to target at least 15 per cent of crude oil imports through the equity oil route within the next two to three years. 

 The report talks about China, which has already achieved the 15 per cent target by encouraging its companies to participate in overseas oil exploration and production. 

 It has criticised the individual initiatives of downstream companies like Indian Oil to go in for upstream acquisitions abroad as it has contributed to an unseemly competition among Indian companies to acquire oil equity abroad. 

 The committee recommends a consortium approach whereby the downstream companies can team up with either OVL or OIVL for a stake in overseas oilfields.

 If aggressive initiatives are to be taken from the point of view of energy security it would be necessary to have more than one organisation under public sector enterprises for overseas ventures, the report adds.

 The committee has also suggested that OIVL should form different consortia with other public sector oil companies or Gail for each of the ventures abroad. The core competence, such as exploration, refining, transportation, of the respective oil companies would add to OIVLs strength, the report adds. 

 To ensure that there is no competition between OVL and OIVL, the committee says the latter would bid only for smaller oil or gas fields producing up to 2 million tonnes of oil equivalent per annum. The bigger assets would be left to OVL.

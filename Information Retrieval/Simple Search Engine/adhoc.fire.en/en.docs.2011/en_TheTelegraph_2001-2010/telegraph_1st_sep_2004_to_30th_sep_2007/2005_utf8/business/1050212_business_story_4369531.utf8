 Mumbai, Feb. 11: Jet Enterprises Pvt Ltd will transfer and assign rights, title and interest in the Jet Airways trademark to Jet Airways.

 Jet Airways does not own the ?Jet Airways? mark at present. This has been licensed to the company for use in India by Jet Enterprises, a company substantially owned by Naresh Goyal, for a particular fee under a registered user agreement.

 Under the user agreement, Jet Airways has to pay Jet Enterprises licence fees varying between 0.10 per cent and 0.20 per cent of its gross revenue. Under the common law agreement, on the other hand, Jet Airways has to pay a fixed annual fee of Rs 1 lakh for each trademark licensed under this pact.

 Both these agreements are valid for 15 years commencing October 2002 and are renewable by Jet Enterprises for 10 years more.

 Cairn toughens stand

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 17: Cairn Energy chief executive officer Bill Gammel said here today that his company would go in for arbitration proceedings if ONGC and the government did not resolve in its favour the dispute over the payment of cess relating to its oil discovery in Rajasthan.

 He said the company was not satisfied with the law ministry?s ruling that both ONGC and Cairn should share the Rs 900-per-tonne cess in proportion to their equity in the joint venture company. 

 Cairn has taken the stand that ONGC should be liable for the cess and royalty payment as it was the licensee of the Rajasthan block.

 Cairn Energy owns a 70 per cent stake in the field, while ONGC owns a 30 per cent share.

 The government has taken the stand that the cess has to be paid to the state government by the two companies in the same ratio as their shareholding as the block was not given to them under the conditions of the new licensing policy. Under the older regime, cess is payable on all oil and gas discoveries to the state governments concerned.

 Gammel said Cairn has already invested $1.25 billion in India since it entered the country 10 years ago and ?discovered or developed commercial reserves of well over 500 million barrels of oil?.

 The company has made the first deepwater discoveries on the east coast and opened up a significant new hydrocarbon province in Rajasthan.

 He said the application of good geo-science and new thinking had resulted in the successful development of the Ravva oilfield along with its partners ONGC and Ravva Oil.

 Reaching out

 Calcutta, May 16: Reliance Infocomm plans to expand operations to 200 towns and 16,000 villages in Bengal by December, while it is currently present in 40 towns and 1500 villages.

 Khurshed Ahmed, head of Reliance Infocomm (Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand), said, The network expansion in the Bengal circle is part of the companys initiative to reach out to rural areas and network 5700 towns and 4 lakh villages across the country to reach out to 65 crore people by December. The expansion will cover nearly 70 per cent of the 8 crore population in Bengal against the current coverage of 40 per cent.

 The network will cover eight major national highways, 18 state highways and 20 rail routes through a 3000-kilometre terabit optic fibre route. The telecom major has already outlined an investment of Rs 300 crore for Bengal and plans to double its network capacity.

 Though only mobile services will be offered initially, we will introduce all our services, including landphones, broadband and PCO in a phased manner, said Ahmed. There is an immense potential for growth in the Bengal circle as the teledensity is only 2 per cent.

 Reliance also plans to commence services in North Bengal and Sikkim in the next few weeks. The Bengal circle includes Sikkim and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

 We will also increase the network of Web World Express (WWE) to 69 from 58 at present, said Ahmed. This will help us reach out to the subscriber and ensure instant co-ordination, he added.

 On April 30, 2005, Reliance had 1,48,862 subscribers in Bengal and 5,67,934 users in Calcutta. Of this, 85 per cent are mobile subscribers.

 The company has already crossed the 10-million-subscriber mark nationally.

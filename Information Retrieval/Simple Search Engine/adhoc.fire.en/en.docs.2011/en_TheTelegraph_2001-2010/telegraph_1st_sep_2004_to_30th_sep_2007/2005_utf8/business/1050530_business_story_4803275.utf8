The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Cellular companies spar on subscriber information

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, May 29: The Association of Unified Telecom Service Providers of India has accused GSM operators of providing new connections without verifying subscriber credentials adequately.

 The association, a representative body of CDMA operators, has written to the department of telecommunications (DoT) that GSM operators like AirTel, Hutch, Idea and Spice are not insisting on photographs from users.

 Though GSM operators declined to comment individually, they said the allegations were baseless as they were complying with the regulations. 

 The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), the body representing the GSM industry, said all its members were complying with the norms.

 In a letter to DoT on April 25, the CDMA associations secretary-general, S. C. Khanna, said: Since GSM operators have recently dispensed with the practice of asking for photographs from prepaid subscribers, CDMA operators should also allow their retailers and dealers to follow a similar practice.

 Khanna has also asked DoT to take immediate action in providing a level-playing field. The association feels that CDMA operators are losing business because of non-compliance.

 The unified telecom associations attitude is well-known, said a COAI official. First, they entered the mobile arena illegally through WiLL. They routed international calls illegally to avoid access deficit charge. They are also seeking backdoor entry into 3G. And now they are trying to accuse us of non-compliance with user information norms.

 DoT has responded by issuing a circular on May 10 to all licensees directing them to carry out complete verification of subscriber identity before providing a connection.

 Instances of non-verification of identity of subscribers will be treated as a breach of terms and conditions of the licence agreement and action will be taken, including imposition of financial penalty or invocation of bank guarantee and/or termination of licence, says the circular.

 Mobile operators have to comply with DoT norms, which require them to keep records of each subscriber. Failure to do so will be considered as a security breach and an operator will be required to pay a maximum penalty of up to Rs 50 crore per circle. Subscriber information is a key pre-condition for the 74 per cent FDI intelecom.

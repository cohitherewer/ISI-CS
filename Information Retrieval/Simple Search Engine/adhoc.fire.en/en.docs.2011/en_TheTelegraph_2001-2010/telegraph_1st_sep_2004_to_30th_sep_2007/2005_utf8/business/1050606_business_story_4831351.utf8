 Q amp;A

 Taxing times

 Under the new income tax rules apart from deductions under section 80C, are deductions for repayment of home loan and study loan, health insurance premium, medical expenses incurred for self and dependent allowed over and above the Rs 1 lakh limit under section 80C?

 Saurabh Chandra, by e-mail

 While repayment for home loan is included within the deduction of Rs 1 lakh, repayment of education loan, health insurance premium and medical expenses incurred for self and dependent are allowed separately.

 Property pangs

 I have sold a residential plot and a flat. Do I have to pay capital gains tax if I invest only the gain amount in a new residential flat within two years of the sale?

 B. N. Ghose, Calcutta

 You will be eligible for exemption from capital gains tax if you invest the gain amount. However, if the cost of the new asset is lower than the gain amount, you shall be entitled for exemption on that amount.

 Truant fund

 I had purchased 500 units of Sun F amp;C Emerging Technologies Fund, but when I sent a redemption request to the fund house, I found that it had wound up. Please help.

 Devashish Pal, Calcutta

 F amp;C Mutual Fund has been taken over by Principal Mutual Fund and, therefore, you should address your redemption request to the latter fund house.

 Spouse dilemma

 If the husband pays the insurance premium for his wifes policy, will he get the rebate for the premium amount considering both have taxable income ?

 B. Adhikary, Jalpaiguri

 The husband can claim the rebate for the insurance premium, if he pays the amount from his income.

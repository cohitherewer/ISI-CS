 Calcutta, April 28: Chinese steel makers are negotiating directly with states rich in iron ore like Orissa, Jharkhand and Karnataka to source raw material for their plants back home.

 A 12-member Chinese delegation is now touring India to explore opportunities in mining as well as the iron and steel sector as a whole.

 The combined steel production capacity of the companies represented by the team is 35 million tonnes. The group is looking for a long-term contract for at least 12 million tonnes of iron ore.

 The delegation will meet the officials from Orissa Mining Development Corporation (OMDC) tomorrow in Bhubaneswar. They will catch up with the Jharkhand government over the weekend before going back to China.

 It, however, remains to be seen if any more iron ore is allowed to be exported to China. 

 The Left parties, supporting the Congress government at the Centre, has upped their ante against iron ore exports.

 Indian steel makers have also raised their voices against mindless export of iron ore, neglecting the long-term raw material security of the country.

 At present, India exports 40 million tonnes annually, mostly to China. Indian ores are of a high quality with 60-65 per cent ferrous content.

 To avoid the wrath, the Chinese delegation is looking at value addition here and exporting the finished steel to different markets. 

 ?We are looking at both options, importing iron ore from India as well as setting up plants here,? Zhou Zhijiang, leader of the Chinese delegation, said in Calcutta.

 The Chinese team was in the city to initiate talks with local players. 

 They also went to Haldia to examine the port infrastructure there.

 V. Dhupia, director of the Indo-China Trade Centre, who co-ordinated the delegation, said Chinese companies were looking at every possible way to co-ordinate with their Indian counterparts. ?Joint ventures and technology transfers are possible. They are in a fact-finding mission. Initial discussions are taking place,? she said.

 The interaction with local players was organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce (BCC). Sabyasachi Sen, principal secretary (commerce and industries) of Bengal and Gopal Krishna, managing director, West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC), attended the meeting.

 Sen said the recent visit by the Chinese premiere has given a boost to the Indo-China trade.

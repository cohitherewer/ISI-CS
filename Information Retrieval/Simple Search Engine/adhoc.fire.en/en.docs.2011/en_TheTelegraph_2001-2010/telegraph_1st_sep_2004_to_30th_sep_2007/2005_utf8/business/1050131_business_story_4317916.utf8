 Dunlop offers to pay part of arrears

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Jan. 30: A meeting to revive Dunlop India?s closed factory at Sahaganj ended with an assurance from the management that it would clear 10 per cent of the Rs 29-crore wage arrears if courts release money from a property sale.

 The promise came after two hours of talks that Union labour minister Chandrasekhar Rao held today with company executives, labour unions, key ministers of the Bengal government ? Nirupam Sen and Mohammad Amin ? and state chief secretary Asok Gupta.

 ?The management has agreed to pay 10 per cent of the wage arrears of employees at Sahaganj, which is Rs 2.9 crore. We have asked it to reopen the factory. The officials have assured us they will look into the matter,? said Rao. 

 The unpaid wages stand at Rs 53 crore if Dunlop?s other factory in Tamil Nadu?s Ambattur is taken into account.

 The chief operating officer of Jumbo World Holdings (India), H. N. Nanani, said he would move court to get part of the Rs 10.75 crore it raised from the sale of Dunlop?s Mirza Ghalib Street office to Calcutta?s Pataka group. The Jumbo group owns 44 per cent of the ailing tyre-maker.

 Rao promised to attend another meeting in Calcutta on February 22, when talks to revive the factory will be renewed. The company is expected to specify within a fortnight just how much money can be released to pay the wage dues of 2,800 Sahaganj workers who remain on the rolls.

 Asked about its future plans, Jumbo officials said their case had been hanging fire at Appellate Authority for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction since May 2002.

 Today?s meeting was a follow-up to an assurance that Rao gave last month in Parliament to Left MPs Rupchand Pal, Shantashree Chatterjee and Ajay Chakraborty.

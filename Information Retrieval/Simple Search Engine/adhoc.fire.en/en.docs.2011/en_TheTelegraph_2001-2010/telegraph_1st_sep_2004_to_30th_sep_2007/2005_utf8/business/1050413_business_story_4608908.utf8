 Tatas exit Bangalore tech park 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, April 12: The Tata Group today offloaded its 47 per cent stake in the city?s International Tech Park Ltd to Ascendas Pte Ltd, a Singapore-based real estate firm. 

 Ascendas is part of a consortium of Singapore companies, which holds a 47 per cent stake in ITPL in a joint venture with the Tata group (47 per cent) and the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (6 per cent).

 ?Ascendas?s expanded shareholding marks a significant step in its business strategy to build a portfolio of business space in India, following its recent acquisition of Venenburg IT park in Hyderabad,? a joint statement by the Tatas and Ascendas said.

 The statement did not reveal the cost of the acquisition.

 ?While the divestment of our stake is in line with the (Tata) group?s strategy to exit non-core areas of interest, the Tata group will continue its business relations with ITPL,? Tata Industries Ltd managing director K. A. Chaukar said.

 ?The park has catalysed the creation of a vibrant IT industry in Bangalore and has placed India securely on the world IT map,? Chaukar added.

 ITPL is home to over 100 software and new economy firms located in five multi-tenanted buildings on a 69-acre land in the city outskirts. The first phase was completed at a cost of Rs 562 crore in 1994. 

 Last year, it was expanded with the stakeholders pumping in an additional Rs 160 crore.

 Ascendas president and CEO Chong Siak Ching said the acquisition reflects the importance that Ascendas places on ITPL and the importance of Bangalore as an investment location for the company.

 She said Ascendas is setting up an office in the city.

 Goh Kok Huat, chief operating officer of Ascendas, said, ?The company will continue to deliver the same high standards of management that it has been providing since day one in 1994 when the park welcomed its first group of tenants.?

 Originally, the Tatas and the Singapore consortium held 40 per cent each with the Karnataka government retaining the balance 20 per cent. Both the partners raised their stakes to 47 per cent each as the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board was unable to bring in funds. 

 ITPL was mooted in 1992 by the then Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao and Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong to replicate Singapore?s quality infrastructure in India.

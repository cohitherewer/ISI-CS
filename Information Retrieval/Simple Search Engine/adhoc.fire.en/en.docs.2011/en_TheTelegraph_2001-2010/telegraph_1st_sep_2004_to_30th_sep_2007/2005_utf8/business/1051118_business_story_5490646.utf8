 Audit bodies to get more teeth

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: In view of the concerns raised by professional institutes and for ensuring strict compliance with statutory financial procedures, the government has approved withdrawal of amendments to acts governing chartered accountants, cost accountants and company secretaries to bring them in tune with the new financial dispensation.

 The Union cabinet, which met here today, said the 2003 amendment bills to acts governing chartered accountants, company secretaries and cost and works accountants will be withdrawn and replaced by new bills, to be introduced in the winter session of Parliament.

 The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) has decided to introduce the new bills ? Chartered Accountants (Amendment) Bill, 2005, Cost and Works Accountants (Amendment) Bill, 2005 and Company Secretaries (Amendment) Bill, 2005.

 The CCEA has ordered the fresh amendments, which will authorise the governing bodies of these professional institutions to take strong punitive measures against members guilty of professional misconduct.

 Disciplinary committees of bodies running these professions can now try cases of minor and major misconduct and debar members for up to six years. 

 Another amendment has increased the fine on unqualified individuals signing accounts from Rs 1,000 to Rs 1 lakh and Rs 2 lakh and one-year imprisonment, if the offence is repeated second time. 

 The amendments come in the wake of the securities scam of 2001 and the Global Trust Bank crash, where auditors were found to have misrepresented financial statements of the beleaguered bank.

 The fresh amendments follow a series of recommendations made by the empowered group of ministers (GoM), which has gone into the details of the bills. The earlier bills were referred to the GoM after the parliamentary standing committee on finance had suggested major amendments to them.

 The GoM has clarified that the governments approval is not required for creating any posts by the respective CS, CA and ICWA councils. Prior approval of the government in creation of new posts by the council and a statutory provision for a separate chief administrative officer was not necessary, said an official statement issued after the cabinet meeting.

 This puts at rest the anxiety over the institutes losing autonomy due to the governments interference in their routine operational and academic affairs.

 Besides, it has been made clear that the government will have the power to direct dissolution of the ICAI council only in case of persistent default of guidelines.

 The proposed amendments also remove certain other provisions of the three acts governing chartered accountants, company secretaries and cost accountants.

 Unocal reviews CNOOC offer

 Singapore, July 18 (Reuters): US oil producer Unocal Corp held a second board meeting to discuss a fine-tuned $18.5 billion bid from state-run Chinese firm CNOOC Ltd, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.

 The board, meeting in California Sunday night, discussed whether to back the CNOOC offer or stick with an earlier accepted $16 billion-plus bid from global major Chevron Corp, sources said. So far, Unocal has not notified CNOOC about its stance on the Chinese bid, they said.

 Expectations of a bidding war have risen, pushing up Unocal shares about 10 per cent past Chevrons $60 a share offer to near CNOOCs $67 a share offer. CNOOC shares fell 1.6 per cent on Monday, the third day of losses, on fears it could raise its bid further and cut into any value from the acquisition.

 Peter Schoenfeld, chief executive officer of New York-based investment firm PSAM LLC, which holds one million Unocal shares, said CNOOC may need to raise its bid to win Unocals support.

 We feel CNOOC would be well advised to put an improved or best bid on the table now, Schoenfeld said. At this point, CNOOC is not purely bidding against Chevron, but to gain support of the board of Unocal to forego their bird in hand.

 Apollo Tyres net up 25%

 OUR BUREAU

 Oct. 31: A lower excise duty and a higher operating profit helped Apollo Tyres Ltd clock a 25.48 per cent increase in earnings during the July-September period this year compared with same quarter last year. The company today declared a net profit of Rs 18.66 crore for the quarter ended September 30, 2005 against Rs 14.87 crore in the year-ago period. 

 Though net sales grew marginally on year-on-year basis, from Rs 606.86 crore to Rs 632.78 crore in the reporting quarter, a better financial control steered its quarterly operating profit to Rs 60.21 crore from Rs 46.54 crore over the period under review. 

 A more prudential management of its cost affairs is also reflected in the rise of the companys after-tax profit to Rs 22.07 crore in the second quarter this fiscal from 14.87 crore last year, despite a decline in income from other than tyres sales ? from Rs 12.97 crore to Rs 8.2 crore.

 However, provisioning of Rs 3.41 crore for extraordinary items in the second quarter this year has to that extent lowered the net profit of the company.

 For the first six months ended September 30, the company has reported net sales of Rs 1200.87 crore against Rs 1222.23 crore in the same period last year. However, net profit for the period under review went up to Rs 35.35 crore from Rs 30.50 crore a year ago.

 Aptech profit

 In keeping with the market expectations, Aptech Ltd has announced a 49 per cent year-on-year growth in quarterly earnings for the quarter ended September 30 at Rs 6.29 crore from Rs 4.22 crore in the same period last year. Operational income during the period grew 15 per cent on a year-on-year basis to Rs 23.13 crore. 

 For the nine months ended September 30, the companys after-tax profit rose 54 per cent to Rs 18.28 crore from Rs 11.90 crore in the year-ago period. Total income during the nine months rose to Rs 89.97 crore from Rs 76.07 crore. 

 Pramod Khera, CEO amp; managing director, Aptech Ltd, said, In the last quarter, Aptech has continued with its onward growth in all sectors, especially in international and multimedia training, testing and certification and learning services. Our joint venture in China has exceeded our projections and has contributed a large dividend to Aptech Limited. With the infusion of capital by the new investors, we are confident that the organisation will show a good growth in the future. 

 In China, Aptech has recorded a turnover for the nine months ended September 2005 at $16.50 million compared with the annual turnover of $12.01 million in 2004, registering a 75 per cent growth in the first three quarters.

 Stamp of quality for telecom watchdog

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 5: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has got a quality management system certificate licence from the Bureau of Indian Standards.

 Trai is among the first few regulatory bodies in the world to obtain the quality management certificate license under ISO 9001:2000.

 Under the Trai Act, the watchdog is entrusted with the task to regulate, promote and ensure orderly growth of the telecom sector, including broadcasting and cable services, and protect the interest of service providers and consumers.

 However, it had been under attack by consumer organisations and a few operators, who held that the regulator lacked the expertise to undertake the quality testing-related issues.

 To achieve the objectives of the Trai Act, streamline its existing procedures and systematise its functions, the regulator appointed Rail India Technical and Economic Services Ltd (Rites), a public sector undertaking under the ministry of railway, as consultant to establish an institutionalised system for quality.

 A senior Trai official said a quality management system will ensure a systematic environment for process management, consistency in working, measurability of performance and customer focus. 

 This is also aimed to improve efficiency and effectiveness, besides focusing on continual improvement and proactive approach.

 The quality management system established in 2004 was audited by internally trained professionals as well as those from Rites. After ensuring that the quality management system is fully functional, BIS had certified the quality management system to be in conformity with the standards of ISO 9001:2000. 

 The licence issued is operational for 3 years. In this period, BIS will be conducting surveillance audit to ensure continued improvement in the system and procedures.

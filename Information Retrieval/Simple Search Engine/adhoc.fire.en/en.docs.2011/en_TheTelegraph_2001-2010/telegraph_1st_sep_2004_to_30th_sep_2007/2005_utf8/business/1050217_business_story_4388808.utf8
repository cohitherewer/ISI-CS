 Moody?s profit jumps 43%

 Rutherford: Upbeat

 New York, Feb. 16 (Reuters): Moody?s Corp, the parent of credit rating agency Moodys Investors Service, on Wednesday said fourth-quarter profit rose 43 per cent, helped by double-digit revenue growth in its main business lines. 

 New York-based Moody?s also set a 2-for-1 stock split, and said it will increase its common stock dividend by 47 per cent. 

 Quarterly net income rose to $122.6 million, or 80 cents per share, from $85.5 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier. 

 Results included an $8.7 million pre-tax charge, or 4 cents per share after taxes, for stock options expensing, and a $1.6 million charge, or 1 cent per share, related to income taxes. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters Research on average forecast profit of 73 cents per share. 

 Chief executive John Rutherfurd said ?strong conditions? in several businesses, including US residential mortgage-backed and home-equity securitisation markets, helped offset lower US corporate bond issuance. 

 Moody?s rates credit-worthiness on a 21-notch scale from ?AAA? to ?C?. Ratings are a big factor in determining how much issuers must pay to borrow money in the capital markets. Rutherfurd is scheduled to retire in April, and be replaced by Moody?s president Raymond McDaniel. 

 Revenue rose 12 per cent to $391.6 million, as US revenue increased 11 per cent to $240.3 million and non-US revenue increased 13 per cent to $151.3 million.

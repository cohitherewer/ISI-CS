 Calcutta, July 4: The National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) has sought the approval of the Forward Markets Commission (FMC) to launch futures trading in crude and furnace oil.

 ?We have already submitted the contracts to FMC and expect a decision in the next 2-3 weeks,? NCDEX managing director and chief executive officer P. H. Ravikumar said at a session organised by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

 NCDEX is the second exchange in the country to launch energy futures. The commodity market regulator has cleared futures trading in light sweet crude oil and brent crude at the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX).

 Natural gas will also start trading from the NCDEX platform. The exchange has signed a memorandum of understanding with Gail. The exchange will start a spot market in natural gas and follow it up with a futures market, said Ravikumar.

 Crude is the highest traded commodity derivative in the world. Close to $12 billion trade takes place daily in Nymex ? the largest commodity bourse in the world. Along with crude, natural gas is also traded on all leading commodity bourses in the world, including Nymex. 

 The proposed natural gas spot market in NCDEX will facilitate the settlement of a future contract. 

 At present, the gas market is monopolised by Gail and a proper price discovery cannot take place because of the absence of an effective spot market. The proposed spot market will cater to a closed-user group.

 The domestic natural gas market is liquid as demand exceeds the supply. Sponge Iron and fertiliser units are major users of natural gas. Its current production is estimated at about 40,000 m cu mt.

 NCDEX has also approached the ministries of finance and agriculture to enable the banks to become the agents of farmers for trading on the commodity exchanges.

 India Inc worried over trade logjam

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 20: India Inc feels that a failure of the forthcoming WTO Hong Kong ministerial meeting will damage the interest of developing countries.

 In a snap poll conducted by Assocham, over 80 per cent of CEOs and CMDs said a failure of the meeting, like the Cancun ministerial, will damage the interest of developing countries more.

 According to India Inc, completion of the Doha development agenda by 2006 will be in the interest of India, Brazil, China and South Africa. Otherwise, it will only help the US and European Union.

 What do they (EU and the US) lose if the Hong Kong ministerial fails? They would continue to fund their farmers with huge subsidies, which in turn would continue to depress our markets. In a way, they would be happy to buy time before they come around to the pressure of developing countries to reduce domestic support and eliminate export subsidies in agriculture, said T.K. Bhaumik, chairman, WTO expert committee, Assocham.

 Corporate India said completion of the Doha round was even more important against the backdrop of the US fast-track authority expiring in the middle of 2007. The pressure on EU and the US is apparent, says Assocham, since the EU is already asking to lower expectations from the Hong Kong ministerial.

 A setback in Hong Kong will allow EU, the US and the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to buy time to reduce their farm subsidy bill, which runs into $1 billion a day. However, farmers in countries like India will continue to face the impact of the price-depressing and trade-distorting subsidy by the West, the chamber said.

 The success of the Doha round hinges on the breakthrough in negotiations in agriculture, which is stuck on an important issue ? market access.

 The G-20 proposal is being seen as the middle ground or the basis for further negotiations. Regarding domestic support, I am comfortable with the G-20 proposal, which views 70-80 per cent reduction in the amber box. We could even be little flexible in the percentage of cut, may be to 60 per cent, as long the reduction is substantial, Bhaumik said.

 Airbus delays deliveries of superjet

 Late Kate

 Paris, June 1 (Reuters): Airbus said on Wednesday deliveries of its 21st-century flagship, the double-decker A380 superjumbo, would be delayed by up to six months, taking the flourish off one of the most trumpeted aviation launches in decades.

 Disgruntled airlines, at least one of which intends to seek compensation, announced the delay in delivering the largest passenger jet ever built just weeks after its maiden flight.

 Airbus had already started preparing the ground for such an announcement ? Singapore Airlines, which is due to fly the first scheduled A380 service between London Heathrow and Singapore, first said on May 3 it had been notified of a postponement ? and delays to new aircraft are not uncommon.

 But it adds to a growing list of headaches at the European aircraft builder as it slides into a major trade dispute over subsidies with arch-rival Boeing and struggles to fill an internal power vacuum created by its squabbling shareholders.

 Keeping the 10-billion-euro A380 project on track after cost overruns and now delays will be a major task for the next head of Airbus, who has yet to be appointed after its fiery French boss Noel Forgeard fought to become the next co-CEO of parent EADS.

 The worlds second-largest aerospace group had given Forgeard and his German counterpart in EADS until June 1 to come up with a list of appointments to put an end to months of Franco-German discord over who should run Airbus. But an industry source said the EADS board was not yet ready to meet.

 The job is expected to go for the first time to a German aerospace executive, Forgeards number two Gustav Humbert.

 Shares in EADS fell as much as much as 2.2 per cent on news of the A380 delays, leading decliners on the French blue-chip index. At mid-session they were off 1 per cent at 23.77 euros.

 The shares had opened on a backfoot after Australian carrier Qantas Airways said delivery of the A380 aircraft which it has bought would be delayed six months to April 2007.

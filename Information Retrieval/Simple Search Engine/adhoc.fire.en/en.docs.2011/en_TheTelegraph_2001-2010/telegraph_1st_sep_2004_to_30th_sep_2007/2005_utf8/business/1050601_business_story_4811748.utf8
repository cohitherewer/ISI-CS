 EIH profit rises 18% to Rs 33 cr

 A STAFF REPORTER

 On profit track

 Calcutta, May 31: EIH Limited has posted a 17.6 per cent rise in net profit in 2004-05 at Rs 33.12 crore compared with Rs 28.17 crore in the previous fiscal.

 The total revenue of the company increased by 24 per cent from Rs 504.49 crore to Rs 625.25 crore. The company board has recommended a 40 per cent dividend.

 The operating profit increased by 55 per cent to Rs 183.77 crore from Rs 118.49 crore in the previous year. The profit before tax of the company grew by 41.6 per cent to Rs 58.73 crore from Rs 41.47 crore.

 The interest cost of the company increased 112 per cent to Rs 73.73 crore from Rs 34.75 crore during the previous year.

 Managing director S. S. Mukherji said, The industry is on an upswing and the future prospects seem bright for the next 2-3 years.

 The semi-open sky policy of the government has resulted in opening up the aviation sector. It has fuelled the growth and has brought in more people ? for business as well as for leisure, he said.

 Mukherji predicts that the demand for rooms in the northern parts of the country will go through the roof and it will be extremely difficult to find rooms in the region during winter.

 The demand in Delhi will be very high, but there will be no new supply of rooms and the situation will be worse in Bangalore, he said.

 However, this will result in an increase in the occupancy as well as the average room rates of the existing hotels, he added.

 Though the demand in Calcutta will not match that in Delhi and Bangalore, the city will also continue to do well, Mukherji said. The EIH hotels enjoyed an occupancy rate of 67 per cent in 2004-05 against 61 per cent a year earlier. 

 We expect a growth of another 5-6 per cent during the current year, he added.

 Currently, the company is involved in a major project at Bandra-Kurla to develop a five-star deluxe property. The total project is worth Rs 600 crore, of which Rs 300 crore has already been spent, he added.

 In the last quarter of 2004-05, the company has reported a 1.5 per cent decline in net profit at Rs 20.78 crore (Rs 21.1 crore).

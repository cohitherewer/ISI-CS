 ONGC still in Yukos race 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today said India was still in the race for a stake in the Yuganz oilfield of embattled Russian oil giant Yukos.

 ?Discussions are still open with the Russians on the issue and there is no full stop,? he remarked.

 He said India was looking for opportunities in several other areas in Russia such as Sakhalin 3 and there was close co-operation in the hydrocarbon sector between the two countries. ?Russia is our most strategic ally and the Russian Federation is helping us to ensure our energy security,? the minister said. Aiyar is expected to visit Moscow this month and the deal is likely to figure in the talks. 

 Menatep, Yukos? parent company, today served a damages claim of $28.3 billion against the Russian government.

 While China is also competing for the Yuganz oilfield, the minister said, ?We are not necessarily in competition with China. We are similarly placed as far as our energy requirements are concerned and there are several complementary areas between the two countries. India and China are not bitterly fighting against each other.? 

 ?The two countries could work out a co-operative relationship in which we would move together,? he added.

 The Russians expect at least $6 billion for a 15 per cent stake in the Yuganz oilfield of Yukos, which leaves ONGC-Videsh (OVL) initial offer of $2 billion falling far short of the expected price for the lucrative asset.

 Clearly, the $9 billion, which the Russian-government owned Rosneft paid for the Yugansk oilfield in the recent auction, was way below the actual market price. The auction, in fact, was viewed in Russia as a way to redress the chaotic privatisation of the nineties when Mikhail Khodorkovsky had acquired these huge assets at a throwaway price. 

 China National Petroleum Corporation is also reported to have come up with an offer of a $6-billion loan for Rosneft in return for which it expects to get assured crude supplies from the oilfield.

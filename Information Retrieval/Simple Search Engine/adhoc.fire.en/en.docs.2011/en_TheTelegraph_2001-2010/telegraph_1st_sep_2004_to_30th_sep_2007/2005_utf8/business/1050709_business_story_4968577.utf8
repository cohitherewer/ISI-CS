 Assam flavour in Pakistan tea cups

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Harvest time

 Calcutta, July 8: A tea industry delegation, which will leave for Pakistan on Monday, is likely to propose the creation of an exclusive Assam packet for consumers in the neighbouring country.

 The delegates, on their three-day visit, may hold talks with leading tea blenders in Pakistan like Tapal, Unilever and Tetley.

 The industry wants to ship north Indian CTC tea to Pakistan, which currently imports this variety only from the south.

 Gautam Bhalla of Warren Tea, who is also a member of the delegation, said, ?It is a concept we will put forward to Pakistan. It is not an easy task and may take time. We do not expect anything to happen immediately. The idea is to have an Assam packet tea in Pakistan. This is in no way linked to the prices at Mombassa auction (Kenya).?

 Representatives of Warren Tea, Williamson Magor, Jay Shree Tea, Tata Tea, North West Cachar and Bajrang Tea Company will be part of the team. The main task before the delegation is to review the memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Pakistan Tea Association signed in 2004. The agreement envisages that India will export 25 million kg of tea in three years.

 ?We will at least try to export 10 million kg of tea to the neighbouring country. We will also ask Pakistan to allow us duty-free export of 10 million kg. Under the Saarc umbrella, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka get a duty waiver up to 10 million kg,? Bhalla added.

 At present, Indian tea exports to Pakistan hovers around 4-5 million kg 

 The delegation will also attend tasting sessions and visit Jodia Bazar ? the largest wholesale market in Pakistan.

 Tea imports to Pakistan are expected to increase by 18 per cent next year because of free trade with Bangladesh and Nepal. This might touch the $200-million mark in the current financial year.

 It is expected to increase to 119.84 million kg in 2005-06 compared with 109.45 million kg valued at $172.15 million last fiscal. Pakistan consumes 140-150 million kg of tea annually.

 Indian tea is yet to make a dent in imports from Kenya, Bangladesh, Brazil, Uganda and other African countries.

 Around 79.54 million kg of tea is imported to Pakistan from Kenya. This comprises over 65 per cent of the market.

 The Pakistan tea industry feels that Indian tea has failed to beat the import volumes of Kenya and other African countries because of its high prices.

 Mumbai, Jan. 20: Cement giants seem to be breaking down the wall they had built to keep foreigners at bay.

 Swiss cement giant Holcims entry is an about-turn by Indian companies, who have so far prevented foreigners from playing a key role in the domestic cement industry.

 Industry circles recall the time when the Ambuja group took everyone by surprise by acquiring the Tata stake in Associated Cement Companies in 1999. They also remember AV Birla group company Grasim Industries bid to buy out Reliance Industries stake in Larsen amp; Toubro. Grasim eventually went on to control L amp;Ts cement business.

 At that time, cement barons and analysts had said the two takeover bids would ensure that more than half the cement capacity in India remains with local companies. The bids to pick up a little less than 15 per cent as in the case of ACC, ensured that the fences were built high enough to prevent foreigners from entering the industry, experts had said.

 However, the outlook has changed dramatically in the last five years as over-capacities in cement production are being gradually lapped up. The industry is growing at a steady 8 percent. Prices have been inching up too, thus providing companies the incentive to work at full capacities. With demand set to rise, cement majors now seem to be opening up to foreign players, analysts said. 

 ?Our balance sheets are stronger and we are more confident to partner global majors,? an official of Gujarat Ambuja said.

 Analysts added that while India is the second most populated country in the world, its a huge emerging market with immense potential, particularly in the industrial and services sectors. 

 Moreover, the housing boom and rapid expansion of infrastructure is bolstering the construction sector, thus boosting the prospects of the domestic cement industry.

 Observers said Holcim?s move may fuel consolidation in the sector with smaller capacities of 1-2 million tonnes being the hot targets.

 Holcim is the third foreign cement company after Lafarge and Italcementi to evince interest in the domestic cement sector.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Back to day of Big Bull

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 28: When P. Chidambaram unwrapped the dream budget in 1997, Harshad Mehta had bequeathed the Big Bull sobriquet to the finance minister. The original Big Bull was not around when Chidambaram presented his latest edition, neither was anyone calling it a dream budget.

 But the markets did a Harshad Mehta on Chidambaram, with the sensex snapping out a 144-point salute over Friday?s close. The sensex surge, which drove the barometer index to a new closing peak, helped Chidambaram create a record of sorts as it was the second successive post-budget spurt ? a feat not achieved by any finance minister till now.

 The BSE sensex raced to close at 6,713.86 points, comfortably topping the previous best corresponding figure of 6,679.33 points struck two weeks before. 

 The market mood was so upbeat that some brokers said they are sure the sensex will touch 7,000 within a fortnight to a month, if political stability continues. 

 On a day marked by action on most fronts in the capital markets, the RBI intervened to limit the gains in the rupee. 

 But bonds slid on worries that India would borrow more in the new financial year as the budget estimated a higher-than-expected fiscal deficit.

 The markets were buoyed by budget proposals to cut corporate tax and boost funding for infrastructure. 

 Ved Prakash Chaturvedi, the managing director of Tata Mutual Fund, said the budget will enable the markets to shift ?from a cyclical boom to a structural uptrend?.

 ?What our markets have lacked over the past two decades has been a consistent long-term bull run. For a change, this time around we have been in a two-year bull run with the index hovering near all-time highs. The market is now looking at the long-term growth story of the country,? Chaturvedi added. 

 ?Indian markets are an investor?s paradise with no tax on dividend and long-term capital gains. Investors are much better off in the Indian tax regime than most other markets,? says Ajit Sanghvi of MSS Securities, an institutional broker.

 Among the stocks that were in the limelight were that of banks and companies dealing with infrastructure. So were sugar stocks.

 Bank stocks surged to new highs as the budget proposed to amend rules to spur mergers and acquisitions in the fragmented sector. State Bank of India, the largest commercial bank, climbed 4.25 per cent. 

 The rupee closed slightly stronger, helped by dollar weakness overseas and strong foreign fund investment in local shares. But traders said the rupee had to surrender most of its early gains as the central bank pinned it down to keep exports competitive. 

 The rupee closed at 43.6750/6850 per dollar, 0.13 per cent stronger than Friday?s close of 43.7250/7400.

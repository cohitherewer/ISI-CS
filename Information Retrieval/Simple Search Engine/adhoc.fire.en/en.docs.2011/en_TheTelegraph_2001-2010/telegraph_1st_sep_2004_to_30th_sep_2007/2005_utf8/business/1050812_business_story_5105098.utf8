 Patel clears air on aviation norms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patel: Point by point

 New Delhi, Aug. 11: Persons of Indian origin who are not Indian citizens cannot operate airlines in the country under the existing rules, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said in the Lok Sabha today.

 ?The existing civil aviation requirements stipulate that a scheduled or non-scheduled air transport operator?s permit could be granted only to Indian citizens,? he said.

 This has put paid to the attempts by Neera Radia, a British citizen of Indian origin, to start her own airline ? Magic Air ? at least for the time being.

 Patel, however, told members of Parliament that the government was examining the issue and will consult ?all concerned?.

 In reply to another question, the minister said the government is not in favour of direct or indirect equity participation by foreign airlines in the domestic sector, though the Planning Commission has argued for such a move in its mid-term appraisal of the Tenth Five-Year Plan.

 ?There is a case for reviewing this policy as airlines require operational expertise as much as capital,? Patel said. However, the government was currently not in favour of direct or indirect equity participation by foreign airlines in domestic carriers, the minister added.

 The issue of foreign control of airlines has come up repeatedly before the cabinet with several ministries, including the home ministry, strongly pitching against a majority holding of domestic airlines by foreign investors. The governments headed by the United Front, BJP and Congress have favoured keeping foreign control limited to below the 50 per cent-mark and foreign airlines out of the picture altogether.

 To another question, he said the governments share in the Airports Authority Of India ?is not being divested?.

 Patel said the draft civil aviation policy, which proposes to cover the policy on traffic management, was ?to be finalised through inter-ministerial consultations?.

 Regarding shortage of air traffic controllers, the minister said 229 posts had been created last year and steps to fill up 106 posts were under way.

 Coke bosses take stock

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 20: The top brass of beverage giant Coca-Cola is here to review its Indian operations.

 The companys Asia-Pacific chief Patrick T. Siewert and Irial Finan, president, bottling investments, were flown in to work on restructuring the bottling operations in India.

 However, when contacted, a Coca-Cola company spokesperson maintained both these officials have visited us several times, this is not their first visit to India.

 He added, They are here for routine meetings. India is a very important market for Coca-Cola, but there is nothing special on the agenda this time around. There is no announcement to be made.

 Industry sources, however, say that Coca-Colas top brass is here to review their current level of investments and need for future inflows. Todays meeting reportedly discussed issues such as introduction of new products, focus on current trends and strategies as well as steps needed to meet sales targets. 

 Coca-Cola bottling operations here are run by its subsidiary, Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages, in which Coca-Cola India has a 51 per cent stake. However, unlike in the US where the marketing and bottling operations are separate, all operations in India are headed by the divisions president, Sanjeev Gupta.

 The actual bottling operations in India are almost evenly divided between plants owned by Coca-Cola itself and franchisee-owned plants. There are 27 company-owned and 17 franchisee-owned bottling plants in the country.

 A network of 29 contract-packers also manufactures a range of products for the company.

 Most goods and services required to produce and market Coca-Cola are made locally, sometimes with the help of technology and skills from the parent company.

 The complexity of the Indian market is reflected in the distribution fleet, which includes 10-tonne trucks, open-bay three-wheelers that can navigate the narrow alleyways of Indian cities, and trademarked tricycles and pushcarts.

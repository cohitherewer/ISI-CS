 Jindals to breathe easy on old debts

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Feb. 9: Outstanding debts of Jindal Iron and Steel Company Ltd (Jisco) and Jindal Vijaynagar Steel Ltd (JVSL) are expected to come down to Rs 3,500 crore by the end of the current financial year from Rs 4,100 crore.

 It may go down further to Rs 3,000 crore by March 2006 since the OP Jindal group is working towards a debt-equity ratio of 1:1. Even as old debts are being repaid, the firms are borrowing afresh for expansion plans.

 Funds for the Rs 1,275-crore four million-tonne expansion plan at Bellary in Karnataka have been tied up, an official said. The company plans to use Rs 425 crore from its internal accruals and take a loan of Rs 850 crore from a group of banks led by ICICI Bank.

 The Jindal group, which has acquired a 40 per cent stake in Southern Iron amp; Steel Company (Siscol) from Laxmi Machine Works, is also planning an expansion at Siscol?s Salem facility. Its capacity is being increased to 8,00,000 tonnes from 3,00,000 tonnes at a cost of Rs 400 crore. 

 The financial closure of the project, which has debts of Rs 280 crore, has been completed. Another Rs 120 crore will come from a rights issue. 

 Siscol has recently announced a rights issue in the ratio of eight shares for every five held. The Jindal group has already laid out plans to set up a five million-tonne greenfield steel plant in Bengal. 

 The total cost of the project is Rs 10,000 crore?12,000 crore. The project depends on the allotment of iron ore mines, which are in Jharkhand. Iron ore is one of the major raw materials for steel industry.

 The Bengal government had initiated talks with Jharkhand, but these could not go too far because of elections in the neighbouring state. Sources in the commerce and industry department said negotiations are likely to resume after two months.

 Since two state governments are involved in the process, the Jindal group is considering a split-location plant, based in both states. Kharagpur ? from where the nearest port is 120 km away and iron ore deposits at a distance of 50 km ? has been spotted as an ideal location.

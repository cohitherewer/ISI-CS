 Calcutta, Aug. 6: Toyota Kirloskar Motor, a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan, is planning to foray into the small car segment to achieve a 10 per cent share of the growing Indian car market.

 According to Toyohiko Ino, director, (marketing, sales amp; service division) of Toyota Kirloskar Motor, small cars would give the company the volume it has been eyeing for the market here.

 Even as he declined to give the timeframe as to when Toyota Kirloskar would roll out its small car in the domestic market, Ino said the company has been exploring the options in the choice of models and facilities for manufacturing them in India. 

 Everything is in the drawing board right now. We are yet to take a call on the model which will be launched here, Ino said at a press meet in Calcutta on Saturday.

 Toyota Kirloskar at present has three models in India, namely Innova, Corolla and Camry, after it had phased out the highly successful Qualis last year.

 The company has no presence in below-Rs 6 lakh category that contributes over 70 per cent of car sales in India. Currently, Maruti and Tata Motors dominate in this segment. Toyota Kirloskars strategy is to enter this segment which has enough room to accommodate a third player.

 The company has a number of options at hand for the Indian market ? a sedan in Yalis, a hatchback in Passo or Vios or Platz. 

 Toyota Kirloskar at present has an annual production capacity of 60,000 vehicles. The company aims to achieve a sales figure of 2 lakh cars by 2010.

 Ino said the company might add a new production line to its existing facility at Bidadi near Bangalore. However, he didnt rule out the possibility of setting up another manufacturing unit at some other place. 

 So far Toyota Kirloskar has invested Rs 876 crore in India and for this year itself, it has lined up an investment of about Rs 130 crore for removing the production bottlenecks.

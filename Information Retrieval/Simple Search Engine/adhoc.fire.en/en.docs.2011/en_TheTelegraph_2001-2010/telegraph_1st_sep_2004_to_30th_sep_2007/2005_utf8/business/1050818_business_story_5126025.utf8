 Fresh revival plan for tea

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 17: The Centre is working on a new revival package for the tea industry, commerce minister Kamal Nath said today.

 Replying to a question in the Rajya Sabha, the minister said new competitors and the decline in quality of Indian tea were the main reasons for the poor performance of the industry. 

 He added that the profit earned during the boom years were not ploughed back by planting new bushes. As a result, the quality of tea has deteriorated as the existing bushes are old. 

 The minister said Sri Lanka and Vietnam have emerged as strong competitors. The slump in world tea prices had a cascading effect on domestic prices. This has further aggravated the situation, he added.

 Nath will hold discussions with various stakeholders in the industry to draw up the revival plan.

 He said tea gardens have come up in three of the five blocks of Bihars Kishangarh district, which the Tea Board has found suitable for growing tea. 

 At present, there were 4,000 hectares of land under tea plantation in the district owned by more than 1000 growers.

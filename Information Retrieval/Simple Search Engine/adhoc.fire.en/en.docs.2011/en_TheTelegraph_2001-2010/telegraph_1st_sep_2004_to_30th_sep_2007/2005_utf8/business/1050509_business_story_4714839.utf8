 Trai to rework leased line rates

 Buzz gets louder

 Mumbai, May 8 (PTI): The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) will restart pricing process for international private leased line circuits (IPLC) from the scratch. It follows the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunals (TDSAT) quashing of its existing order. TDSAT has also directed Trai to share with VSNL the basis of its calculation and the Ernst amp; Young (E amp;Y) report on which the price bands were fixed.

 ?The authority is planning to bring out a fresh consultation paper and will ask for feedback from all stakeholders once again,? Trai sources said.

 Earlier, VSNL had challenged the basis of price ceilings on grounds that the process was not transparent and was against the ?principles of natural justice?.

 TDSAT had upheld VSNLs plea and set aside the order on April 29, 2005, directing Trai to share the basis of calculations and the E amp;Y report with VSNL. Following TDSAT order, other stakeholders are believed to have approached Trai demanding information and participation in the price ceiling process. 

 With Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) also planning an undersea cable between Port Blair and Singapore, the international bandwidth prices are expected to fall within the next six months.

 Spectrum for 3G service

 The telecom regulator is expected to recommend the IMT-2000 2-ghz frequency band for mobile operators, both GSM and CDMA, for the third generation mobile services in its forthcoming spectrum proposals.

 The move will benefit GSM-based cellular operators such as Idea, Hutch and Bharti. Meanwhile, BSNL, Bharti and MTNL have announced their plans to go for the 3-G services that allow advanced voice, video and data services on mobiles.

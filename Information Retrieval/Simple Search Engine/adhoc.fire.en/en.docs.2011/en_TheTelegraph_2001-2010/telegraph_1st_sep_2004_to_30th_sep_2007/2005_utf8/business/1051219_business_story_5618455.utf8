 Patent shield for Darjeeling tea, Basmati

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hong Kong, Dec. 18: The trade ministers at the World Trade Organization meeting today decided to step up negotiations to reach an agreement by June 30, 2006 on granting products such as Darjeeling tea, Basmati rice and Alphonso mangoes the same level of protection as Scotch whisky and Champagne. 

 All these products have brand values and flavours unique to the geographical region in which they are produced.

 India has been trying to add Darjeeling tea and Basmati rice to the list of products under the trade-related intellectual property rights (TRIPS) agreement for a higher level of protection. 

 Till now, only wines and spirits were being considered under the multilateral system of notification and registration of geographical indications mandated in article 23.4 of the TRIPS agreement.

 The WTO draft agreement also includes, at Indias behest the need to put in place measures to prevent bio-piracy of traditional knowledge of communities such as medicinal herbs and plants like neem and haldi used in the ayurveda and unani systems of medicine. 

 The move has been necessitated as western countries have made attempts to get patents on Basmati rice and neem.

 Board names SAIL chief

 Roongta: The chosen one

 New Delhi, Dec. 18: S.K. Roongta, SAILs director personnel, has been selected by the Public Sector Enterprises Recruitment Board to head the Rs 34,000-crore steel company.

 The board has taken into account Roongtas track record, sources said. However, the steel ministry, which runs the Steel Authority of India (SAIL), is not happy with the selection. Senior officials close to steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan said they may contest the choice.

 They said an enquiry committee was set up some time ago over a controversial coal deal, which SAIL concluded last year with Roongta as the prime mover. They want this fact to be taken into account in the selection process. The report, which was submitted some time back, is currently lying with the steel secretary.

 Roongta fell foul of Paswan after several MPs wrote to the steel minister questioning the on-the-spot coal purchases made last year by SAIL after its Australian suppliers claimed their mines had been flooded.

 The flooding had seen severe coal shortages in SAIL plants, forcing the steel company to resort to rationing till it booked coal through spot purchases.

 A committee comprising Roongta, other SAIL directors and joint secretaries from the ministry made the spot purchase decisions. However, when Paswan ordered a probe, Roongta went on leave as he was the principal functionary.

 Steel ministry officials said they would forward the report of the committee to the Prime Ministers Office as it will take a final call on the SAIL chief. The top job in SAIL falls vacant in August next year when the current incumbent V.S. Jain, known for having turned around the company, retires.

 A number of PSU executives, including many SAIL directors, were in the fray. However, Roongta was rated as number one based on his efficiency, qualifications and experience. According to new rules, the recruitment board can recommend only one name and not a whole panel as was done earlier.

 The Prime Ministers Office will finally decide on the chief as is common with navratna PSUs. The Prime Minister has been closely linked to the final selection of chiefs of SAIL, ONGC, Bhel, Indian Oil and NTPC.

 SAB bottles up Colombian brewer

 Setting sights on distant horizon

 Bogota/London, July 19 (Reuters): SABMiller Plc is buying South Americas No.2 brewer Bavaria SA in an agreed $4.8-billion deal to tap fast-growing beer markets and take on regional leader InBev. 

 SABMiller said on Tuesday the stock-and-cash deal, which boosted its shares over 7 per cent to a record high, is worth $7.8 billion including debt and subsidiaries and will lift it above Anheuser-Busch to become the worlds No.2 brewer by volume. 

 Its a strategically sound deal, theyve paid a sensible price and its a good opportunity for them, said John Smith, investor director at Brown Shipley. 

 The worlds top beer makers have been scrambling to buy brewers in emerging markets to offset slower growth in developing countries and take advantage of economies of scale. Belgiums Interbrew bought Brazils Ambev last year to become South Americas, and the worlds, biggest brewer. 

 SABMiller said it was buying a 71.8 per cent stake in Colombian-based Bavaria from the Santo Domingo family by issuing 225 million shares worth about $3.5 billion. This will give the family a 15.1 per cent stake in the combined group. 

 The Anglo-South African group will buy out minority investors at $19.48 a share in cash, as well as minorities in Bavaria subsidiaries, for a total of $2.1 billion in cash. 

 The deal values Bavaria at around 10 times earnings before interest, tax, deprecation and amortisation (EBITDA), below the 11-13 times paid by Interbrew for Ambev, according to a SABMiller spokesman. 

 Its a deal that doesnt look overly expensive, said David Liston, Senior Global Beverages Analyst at Barclays Investment Services. It completes them geographically and certainly Latin America is reckoned to be a growth market. 

 Bavaria, which makes Aguila, Cristal and Pilsner beers and dominates beer markets in Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Panama, represented the last opportunity for an international brewer to gain large-scale access to Latin America.

 The worlds four top brewers all looked at buying Bavaria, but SABMiller was tipped to win. 

 SABMiller chief executive Graham Mackay said Bavarias four major markets offered strong growth prospects. 

 With GDP (gross domestic product) growth of almost 4 per cent and a young population demographic, the region is positioned to generate sustained, above-average beer consumption growth, he told reporters on a conference call. 

 SABMiller, which brews Miller, Castle and Peroni beers, said the combined group would have annual beer volumes of about 175 million hectolitres and proforma aggregated net revenues of about $12.5 billion. 

 The firm said it expected annual cost savings and operating improvements to reach $120 million by March 2010 and for the deal to boost earnings, before cost and revenues synergies, for the proforma financial year ending March 2006. 

 It estimated its total cash outlay for the deal, including buying subsidiary companies, would be around $2.1 billion and said it was taking on about $1.9 billion in debt, boosting its total net debt to around $6.2 billion from $2.2 billion. 

 The Santo Domingo family is selling 3 per cent of its stake in Bavaria for cash, worth about $180 million, and has agreed not to sell its holding in the combined group for five years. 

 The family will be SABMillers second biggest shareholder, behind Altria, which holds 25 per cent after selling Miller to South African Breweries in 2002.

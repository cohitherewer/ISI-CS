 L amp;T lines up alumina venture in Orissa

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 4: Larsen amp; Toubro today announced plans to set up a Rs 5,000-crore integrated bauxite mining-cum-alumina refinery in Orissa. 

 The engineering and construction major will join hands with Dubai Aluminium Co Ltd (Dubal) for the project.

 In the first phase, there will be a 1.4-million tonne alumina refinery, a bauxite mine and associated infrastructure. These include a captive power plant, township and other utilities. 

 The refinery is expected to be commissioned in 2009 with a potential to expand in phases.

 In the second phase, the refining capacity would be doubled to 2.8 million tonnes. An aluminium smelter based on Dubal?s technology will also be set up. L amp;T said it has development rights to bauxite deposits and prospecting in Orissa.

 Company chairman and managing director A. M. Naik said the joint venture with Dubal is in line with its objective of setting up large projects in alliance with global majors. 

 These also provide L amp;T?s engineering and construction division an opportunity to execute the project, he added.

 However, the company did not disclose details on the equity of the venture; nor did it reveal the location.

 L amp;T?s announcement comes days after Vedanta Resources announced plans to set up a 5-lakh tonne aluminium smelter along with 1,000 MW associated power plant at Jharsuguda in Orissa. The project will cost Rs 7,000 crore.

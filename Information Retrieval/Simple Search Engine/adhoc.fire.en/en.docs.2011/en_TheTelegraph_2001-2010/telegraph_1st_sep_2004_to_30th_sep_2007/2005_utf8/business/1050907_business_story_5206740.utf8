 Calcutta, Sept. 6: Gail India Ltd has drawn up an elaborate plan to foray into Bangladesh.

 The company has initiated talks with a number of entities in the neighbouring country to kick off operations there.

 Chairman and managing director Proshanto Banerjee said the company was exploring opportunities in pipeline, exploration and CNG businesses.

 ?We had fruitful discussions with state-owned oil company Petrobangla and some small firms and the response has been good,? Banerjee said in Calcutta after a visit to Bangladesh.

 Gail is planning to tie up with a Petrobangla subsidiary, Bapex, for upstream activities.

 The Bangladesh government will seek bids for exploration blocks in the middle of next year and Gail hopes to team up with Bapex for the same.

 Gail is predominantly interested in the offshore blocks that may be offered in the Bay of Bengal.

 Moreover, the company has sought to offer assistance to monetise stranded gas in an island in southern Bangladesh.

 ?We are doing the same in India. We have offered our assistance. The gas can be utilised for power generation,? he added.

 The company is also looking at building cross-country pipeline to carry cooking gas (LPG). Gail already runs two such pipelines in India. In Bangladesh, a pipeline connecting south to north could be an attractive proposition.

 Banerjee said Gail also might take part in the development of a CNG network in the periphery of Dhaka.

 Myanmar blocks

 A consortium comprising Gail and the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is likely to pick up a stake in the prospective A-3 block off the shore of Myanmar. 

 Banerjee said the companies may be given a 30 per cent stake in the A-3 block and a deal is expected by October.

 ONGC and Gail have 20 per cent and 10 per cent stakes in the A-1 block, which has a high gas reserve. India is trying to get the gas from Myanmar by building a pipeline through Bangladesh.

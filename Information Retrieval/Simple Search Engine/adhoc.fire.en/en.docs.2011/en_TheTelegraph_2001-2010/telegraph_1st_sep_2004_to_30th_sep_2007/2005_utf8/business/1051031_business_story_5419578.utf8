 Promoters ride stock tide

 SATISH JOHN

 Mumbai, Oct. 30: Promoters of Corporate India bought and sold shares aggressively in the second quarter of this fiscal. While some added to their controlling stakes, others sold shares at attractive rates when the market was at its peak.

 Their actions may have had nothing to do with the state of the market, but they does reveal an interesting trend ? that they were as active as the institutional investors.

 The Tatas sold a chunk of VSNL shares during the quarter and added to their controlling stake in group company Tata Motors.

 A couple of years ago, the Tatas were acquiring VSNL shares from the market through a special purpose vehicle ? Panatone ? over and above the shares acquired from the government.

 It is difficult to read a pattern in the way the promoters behaved during the September quarter, analysts said.

 The Oberois added a 3.7 per cent stake to their impregnable holding in East India Hotels, even as ITC?s investment subsidiaries continued to hold on to their ?financial investment? in the Oberoi family-controlled, but publicly listed, company.

 The Oberoi family ? renowned hoteliers ? has a 46.29 per cent stake in East India Hotels. However, there are still three corporate investors holding a little less than 15 per cent in the firm.

 Analysts were also surprised at the activity in Tata Motors, in which the Tatas raised their stake by 3.2 per cent. This would have cost them Rs 600 crore. Tata Motors, which is also listed on the New York Stock Exchange, would have seen the promoters? stake rise after its amalgamation with Tata Finance, not as a result of market share purchases, analysts said.

 Kumar Mangalam Birla?s investment firms raised his stake in Grasim Ltd, the group flagship, by 0.4 per cent.

 The Kanwars added a 1.7 per cent stake in Apollo Tyres, while the promoters of KK Birla flagship Chambal Fertilisers bought 1.4 per cent more shares from the market.

 However, not all promoters added to their portfolios. Some diluted their stakes too. Satyam Computer Services saw a lowering of the promoter stake by 0.7 per cent, which is worth around Rs 120 crore.

 During the quarter ended September 30, Satyam had come out with a sponsored ADS issue that allowed Indian shareholders to offer their shares to foreign investors. In the June quarter, Infosys promoters had done the same.

 Patni Computer, led by Narendra Patni, saw the promoters? pare their holding by 1.9 per cent through deals worth about Rs 100 crore.

 Share sale by promoters or senior officials often prompt investors to analyse the soundness of investing in a particular firm. When Anil Ambani acquired control of Reliance Capital, the ADAE group announced an open offer at Sebi-mandated rates that saw the scrip gaining on the bourses.

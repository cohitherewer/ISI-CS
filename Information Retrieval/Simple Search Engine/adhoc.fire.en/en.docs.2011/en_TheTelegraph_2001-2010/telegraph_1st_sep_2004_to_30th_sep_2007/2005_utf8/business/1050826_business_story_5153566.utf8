 Grasim cottons on to blended fabric

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 24: The textiles division of Grasim Industries Ltd, the flagship of the Rs 27,000-crore AV Birla Group, has decided to foray into the blended-cotton business. It has lined up an investment of Rs 100 crore to expand and modernise the capacity. The company decided to enter the blended-cotton segment following a robust demand for cotton textiles from the urban and semi-urban markets.

 This market is now dominated by Arvind Mills and Century Textiles.

 A Grasim official said blended cotton production would start from January and it would hit the market by March-April.

 We are looking at a separate brand for the fabric. It will be a cotton-mixed material, said R.K. Choudhary, vice president, (sales).

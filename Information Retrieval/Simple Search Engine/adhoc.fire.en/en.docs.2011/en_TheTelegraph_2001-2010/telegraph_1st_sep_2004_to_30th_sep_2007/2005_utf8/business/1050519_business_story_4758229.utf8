 Bengal plays Basell hardball

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sen: Rethink mode

 Calcutta, May 18: The Bengal government may go back on its decision to sell its stake in Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) to Purnendu Chatterjee if the latter pledges them to raise a Rs 2,500-crore loan for Basell Polyolefins.

 ?We are not in favour of the proposal. The Bengal government, as the majority shareholder in HPL, will think several times before allowing Purnendu to raise loans by pledging the company?s assets to become a minority stakeholder in Basell. The balancesheet of the company will again be saddled with debt,? Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen said.

 ?It is a costly proposition for HPL, which has just turned around and booked a profit,? Sen said.

 ?At this point, we do not think it is the right move,? he added. Sen was speaking on the sidelines of a national workshop on restructuring public sector enterprises.

 HPL can own 10 per cent of Basell if it invests Rs 2,500 crore in the Dutch petrochem giant. The TCG-led consortium has bagged Basell for $5.7 billion (Rs 25,000 crore). Leonard Blavatnik, the Russian oil billionaire, is part of the consortium through US-based Access Industries. 

 Sen?s comments mean that Purnendu will need to play hardball on including HPL in the Basell deal. The green signal from the corporate debt restructuring cell led by Industrial Development Bank of India will not be enough.

 On the transfer of the government?s share to TCG, Sen said the decision involved both political and economic considerations.

 He refused to reveal the details of the proposal that Purnendu has placed before the government. However, Sen said Purnendu would be offered the government?s stake if he agreed to the terms.

 Sen did not specify a timeframe within which the deal would be closed. Indian Oil Corporation is also in the race to snap up the government?s equity, he added.

 ?We have always wanted Indian Oil to join HPL. But the first right of refusal is with TCG,? he said. IOC has paid Rs 150 crore in February for 7.5 per cent of HPL. The management is yet to encash the cheque.

 Market analysts miss AIG warnings

 Greenberg: Paying the price

 New York, April 3 (Reuters): The unfolding accounting scandal at insurer American International Group Inc (AIG) is a sad reminder that investors could have been badly burned if they had followed the bullish advice of Wall Street analysts.

 In a sign that investment bank research remains one of the last places to look for warnings about possible corporate shenanigans, at least 19 brokerages have kept ?buy? or better ratings on AIG since probes into the insurance industry began in October. 

 Only one Wall Street brokerage has downgraded AIG stock to a ?sell? recommendation since the insurer was subpoenaed on February 14, according to Reuters Estimates. The stock has fallen 24 per cent and shed $45 billion in market value since then. 

 This see-no-evil behaviour is a loud echo of the Wall Street?s performance during the dotcom bust, and subsequent accounting scandals at Enron and WorldCom, to name a few. 

 Critics say it was obvious for a long time that many analysts too easily accepted the management?s view of AIG affairs.

 ?I stopped going to AIG presentations because there was just a lovefest with the analysts giving very easy questions to management, and the management happily answering them. So I never learned anything additional,? said Brett Gallagher, who helps manage $23 billion in global equities at Julius Baer. 

 AIG acknowledged on Wednesday that it improperly accounted for certain transactions, bolstering long-held views by some investors that AIG manipulated its books. Consistent earnings quarter after quarter suggested something was amiss, they say. 

 ?The reason why over the past 30 years we haven?t been willing to buy AIG is based on our understanding, it was quite obvious, that earnings were being massaged,? said Charles de Vaulx, senior vice-president at First Eagle Funds. 

 But wariness of AIG wasn?t limited to a bunch of cagey investors. Almost three years ago, insurance industry watchdog David Schiff railed about AIG?s accounting and noted that after Enron, opaque or complex finances are a logical concern. What caught Schiff?s eye were disclaimers in AIG?s audit committee reports for 2000 and 2001 that disavowed nearly all responsibility for the company?s accounting, internal controls and financial statements, he wrote in May 2002. 

 Wall Street, which has been under the guise of reform after 10 investment banks agreed in 2002 to pay $1.4 billion to settle charges they misled investors with bullish stock reports, hasn?t seen many problems with AIG.

 As of Tuesday, 18 analysts had ?strong buy? or ?buy? ratings on AIG, while four analysts recommended holding the stock, Reuters Estimates said. 

 AIG?s shares have tumbled 28 per cent from a multi-year high of $77.36 last April. Its multiyear low was $42.92 during the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. AIG shares fell $1.75, or 3.1 percent, to $55.41 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. 

 AIG has been a darling on the Wall Street, where analysts love predictable earnings. Few of them dared question former chief executive Maurice Greenberg, an iron-fisted leader who intimidated almost everyone he ran into, including analysts.

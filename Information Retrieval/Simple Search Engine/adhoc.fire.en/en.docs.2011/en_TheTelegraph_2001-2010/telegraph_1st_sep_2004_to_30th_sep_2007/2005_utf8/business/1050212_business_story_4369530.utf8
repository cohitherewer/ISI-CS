 Bringing people closer

 New Delhi, Feb. 11: Spend only 1 paisa and woo your valentine this year.

 With the Valentine?s Day round the corner, mobile phone operators are all set to attract the young and the not-so-young.

 Idea Cellular and AirTel have launched a special limited period offer of short messaging service (SMS) at 1 paisa. Hutch, Reliance Infocomm and Tata Indicom have also planned a special SMS offer and calls at lower rates.

 Idea is offering its prepaid customers 100 SMS at a rate of 1 paisa on paying Re 1 per day in Delhi and the national capital region. Subscribers need to send a message ?yes? to 5391 to activate the service. The company will deduct Rs 30 from the user?s card value as caution money. The offer could be for a fortnight or extend to a month.

 A senior Idea executive said, ?SMS is the in thing among the youth and our data shows mobile messaging on the rise among prepaid subscribers. The idea is to study the traffic for a limited period and continue to depend on the response and network load.?

 AirTel has offered a similar limited period offer to its subscribers under the Friendz prepaid scheme, who can send SMS at 1 paisa per message without paying the daily rental.

 Prepaid customers outside the Friendz plan can send an SMS for 1 paisa per message at a daily rental of Re 1.

 To subscribe to this facility, users need to send ?one? to 170. To unsubscribe, one needs to type ?none? and send it to 170 or call the helpline.

 This offer can be withdrawn anytime, said executives of Idea, Hutch and AirTel.

 In addition, AirTel will offer special Hello Tunes on the exclusive Valentine?s Day menu. It will have some of the most memorable love songs in different languages.

 Industry observers said while this is a good marketing move to increase subscriber base and test such a daring initiative, it could be counter productive as there is a strong possibility of spam congesting the networks.

 A senior Hutch executive said, ?We have taken care of the problem of network congestion. The SMS will not miss the destination.?

 An AirTel executive said, ?It is true that spam is possible. The reason for stipulating only 100 SMS per day at that rate is aimed to dissuade such subscribers. Further, we can track easily such mobile numbers and block them.?

 First FDI trickle for paper industry 

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL 

 Coimbatore, Sept. 4: The Indian paper industry might get its first share of foreign direct investment (FDI) within the next two months. 

 Though foreign investment in the industry is allowed through the 100 per cent automatic route, no such infusion has actually been made so far. 

 We are conducting a feasibility study for a Finland-based paper company, which would be the first foreign investor in the countrys paper industry, said A.G. Kulkarni, director, Central Pulp amp; Paper Research Institute. He was speaking on the sidelines of Indian Paper 2005, an international trade fair and technical conference on pulp and paper industry, organised by Sai Expocon India Pvt Ltd and Central Pulp amp; Paper Research Institute.

 Kulkarni, however, declined to divulge the identity of the company. The company plans to set up a newsprint plant with a capacity of 0.4 million tonnes per annum either in Gujarat or in Maharashtra, he said. 

 The total investment in the project will be around Rs 1,000 crore. The plant will be based on recycled fibre imported from Finland. The newsprint produced will be sold partly in the domestic market and partly exported. 

 The company also proposes to set up its own port to facilitate imports and exports, said Kulkarni. 

 Big companies are not keen to produce newsprint as the segment has a lower margin than writing and printing paper, where there is scope for value addition and hence the profit is more, Kulkarni said.

 As a result, bulk of newsprint required in India is imported from countries where it is produced on a large scale, he added.

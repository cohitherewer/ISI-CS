 GE to plough back Dabhol proceeds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bayman: Committed

 New Delhi, Nov. 10: GE will reinvest the full settlement amount of $145 million it received in India to strengthen the Dabhol power project.

 Following the comprehensive settlement of its Dabhol-related disputes with the central government, the state government of Maharashtra and its entities and the Indian lenders to Dabhol, GE, through the India Development Fund, plans to return the $145 million in the form of investments with its key customers.

 GE recently established the India Development Fund as part of its strategy to more than triple its revenues in India in the next three years from $0.8 billion in 2004 to $3 billion by 2008.

 Launching the India Development Fund, Scott R. Bayman, president and CEO of GE India, said, The GE India Development Fund is a reaffirmation of our commitment to India as we reinvest the money received in settlement of our claims related to the Dabhol power project. We believed in India then, and we believe in India today. In our view, India is a rising star, and GE is at the beginning of a growth cycle here.

 We firmly believe that the breadth and diversity of GE and in particular the products and services offered by GE Infrastructure can play an important role in helping address many of Indias priorities, he added.

 The company said in a statement it is excited by the renewed interest in power generation in India.

 It also said as a diversified technology and financial services company, GE will intensify its presence in India across several areas. It recently set up a corporate growth team headed by Anil Chawla.

 This team will be working with all of GEs businesses in India to invest appropriately in the countrys economy.

 The company said the entry of low-cost airlines, the open skies policy, the growing number of flyers and the demand for new and upgraded airports offer opportunities to businesses such as GE Commercial Finance, Security and Aircraft Engines.

 GE also sees major opportunities for healthcare, consumer and industrial, security, water and process technologies businesses to support Indias emerging needs.

 The GE India Development Fund allows us to make investments in projects developed by GEs strategic customers as we deepen and broaden our relationships with them. The businesses that make up GE Infrastructure are particularly well suited to support the growth of our customers and India, Bayman said.

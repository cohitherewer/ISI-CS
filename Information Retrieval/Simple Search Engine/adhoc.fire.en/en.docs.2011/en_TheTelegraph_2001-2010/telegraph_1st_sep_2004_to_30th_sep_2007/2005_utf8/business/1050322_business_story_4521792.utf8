 AllBank to tap market in April

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 21: Calcutta-based Allahabad Bank (AllBank) plans to launch its second public offering of 10 crore shares early April.

 Chairman . N. Singh, who was here to present an interim dividend cheque to finance minister P. Chidambaram, said, ?We will come up with our second public offer on April 6. The price of the issue will be determined through the book-building process.?

 North Block officials, however, said the issue is likely to be priced between Rs 80 and Rs 90, which means the bank will mop up Rs 800-900 crore from the public offer. 

 According to officials, the pricing would be arrived at after taking into account the average of the bank?s stock prices for the previous six weeks and carry a discount of 10 per cent for retail investors. 

 The bank had launched its initial public offering three years ago, and mopped up about Rs 100 crore. 

 The bank has appointed six leading merchant bankers ? DSP Merrill Lynch, Kotak Securities, JM Morgan Stanley, SBI Caps, I-Sec and Enam Financial ? to handle the issue. 

 ?Our business will cross Rs 60,000 crore as budgeted for this fiscal. It is 35 per cent more than last fiscal,? Singh said. The bank?s plan is to increase its deposit base to Rs 39,000 crore and loan advances to Rs 21,000 crore, he added.

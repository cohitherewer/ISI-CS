 Mutual funds face the heat for retail lapses

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Damodaran: Hard talk

 Mumbai, June 15: Mutual funds that invest the money of small investors in stock markets were today pulled up for not doing enough on this front and spending their time instead in cavorting with corporate clients.

 Turning the heat on them was Sebi chairman M. Damodaran, who used a CII pulpit to lash out at these funds for misleading communication, rebating and excessive churning of portfolio. He asked them to reach out to the large pool of retail investors who need more help.

 Last year, the BSE sensex went up around 2000 points but the equity component in mutual fund schemes has gone up only marginally, Damodaran said. The suggestion was that no new money has come from retail investors.

 The market super cop asked the Association of Mutual Funds of India (Amfi), the industrys umbrella body, not to take too long to come up with suggestions and solutions. He wanted prompt responses to improve industry practices. 

 The main criticism was that mutual funds were using the term initial public offering (IPO) or at par issue for their new schemes to lure investors. This was the main theme in what Damodaran had to say at the CII event.

 He said issues like miscommunication and excessive churning of portfolios have been taken up with Amfi. It appears increasingly likely that asset management companies will have to change the way they market new schemes.

 Expressing concern over practices that are unfriendly to investors, Damodaran said rebates and incentives to distributors were being used to drive the new schemes ? sometimes at the cost of investors who pay for it.

 Rebating creates distortions for the industry and stands in the way of healthy growth of the sector, he said.

 The Sebi chief also referred to fund advertisements that carry disclaimer clauses about returns being subject to market risks. This was confusing for investors, who do not fathom what exactly these pitfalls mean.

 Mutual funds have opened over 350 offices to reach investors who do not live in large cities. They have not even scratched the surface and they need to do a lot more, he added.

 These companies concede that the retail component in their overall corpuses adds up to only 35 per cent of the estimated Rs 1,68,000 crore being managed.

 This is not a very happy situation. We need to move towards retail, senior finance ministry official U. K. Sinha told industry representatives. People have a lot of money in small towns and you should go to them, he added.

 An estimated 20 million people with an average monthly income of more than Rs 30,000 were keen to invest in mutual funds, Sinha said, quoting from a recent government survey.

 Mutual funds in India have always been concentrating on people from big towns, ignoring smaller towns along the way. Industry officials say some of the funds have been trying to spread to smaller towns in recent times but the results are not tangible enough yet.

 Pernod, Fortune finalise Allied bid

 Paris/London, April 19 (Reuters): France?s Pernod Ricard and Fortune Brands Inc of the United States are putting the finishing touches on a ?7.4-billion ($14 billion) bid for British rival Allied Domecq Plc before it reports on Thursday, sources close to the matter said. 

 ?They?re expecting to have all the work done by tonight; then they?ll go back to the board and confirm the terms,? one of the sources said on Monday. The boards of the three companies would then meet separately to vote on the deal in time to announce it on Thursday, when Allied is due to report its six-month results, the source added. 

 As advisors for the French and US drinks firms work around the clock to clinch the deal, banks are jostling for a slice of the multibillion pound financing package, which is set to be one of the biggest debt deals in Europe this year. 

 The sources said J.P. Morgan Chase amp; Co and Morgan Stanley, which are advising Pernod, would get a piece of the action, with others naming Pernod?s broker Deutsche Bank, French banks BNP Paribas and Societe Generale and Britain?s Royal Bank of Scotland as the other leading debt providers. 

 ?It was being resolved over the weekend,? said one of the sources, adding that Morgan Stanley was set to end up with a smaller piece of the debt financing than originally expected. 

 Pernod, home to such famed brands as Chivas Regal scotch and Martell cognac, made no comment on Monday despite heated speculation of an imminent three-way deal. 

 Allied, which owns Beefeater gin, Courvoisier cognac and Ballantine Scotch, has said nothing since a statement on April 5 confirming it was in talks with Pernod and was working with Fortune Brands. 

 While some press reports put the price for Allied at up to 700 pence a share, the sources said the actual price was likely to emerge in the middle of the 670-680 pence speculated range. 

 ?You?ve seen a lot around 670-675p; it?s certainly not going to be any higher than that,? one of the sources said. 

 Shares in Pernod closed down 1.85 per cent at 116.50 euros, while Allied closed unchanged at 640 pence. Shares of Fortune closed off 1.24 per cent at $85.95 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

 One source close to the deal said Fortune would pay Pernod about ?2.8 billion upfront and Pernod, which would lead the acquisition, would then hand over a number of agreed brands to the US company on completion of the deal. This figure is higher than an original estimate, which other sources had put at around ?2 billion. 

 ?The total consideration is about 7.4 billion (sterling), of which 80 per cent is cash and 20 per cent is equity,? the source said, referring to the portions of cash, raised as debt, and shares Pernod would use to fund the deal.

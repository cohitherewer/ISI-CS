 Mumbai, Nov. 21: The Reserve Bank of India today told banks and non-banking financial companies that they would have to pay a penalty to customers for issuing unsolicited credit cards. These guidelines will come into effect immediately. ?In case, an unsolicited card is issued and activated without the consent of the recipient and the latter is billed for the same, the card issuing bank/ NBFC shall not only reverse the charges forthwith, but also pay a penalty without demur to the recipient amounting to twice the value of the charges reversed,? the RBI said. The norms also prohibit credit card issuers from offering unsolicited loans or other credit facilities to customers. The RBI has also asked banks or NBFCs to allow a credit-card holder to surrender the card on account of any change in credit-card charges to the card-holder?s disadvantage. The apex bank has also asked credit card issuers not to issue wrong bills to customers.

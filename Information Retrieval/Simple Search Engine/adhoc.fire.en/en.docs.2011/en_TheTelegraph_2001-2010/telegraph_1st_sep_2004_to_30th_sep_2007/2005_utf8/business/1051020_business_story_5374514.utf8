 United Bank to recast capital base 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Oct. 19: United Bank of India plans to restructure its Rs 1,800-crore capital base. 

 P.K. Gupta, chairman and managing director of the bank said, We are looking at different possibilities of restructuring the banks capital base.

 Among other things, UBI is contemplating to return the government a part of its share capital in it. This will downsize its total equity capital. 

 The city-based bank is also considering replace a portion of its Tier-I capital with Tier-II capital. 

 Gupta, however, declined to specify the route UBI would adopt to recast its capital base.

 UBI today signed a memorandum of co-operation (MoC) with the Export-Import Bank of India to give a fillip to its forex business, which it has been trying to increase for some time now. The MoC will improve the range and quality of our foreign exchange services to the existing customers, Gupta said.

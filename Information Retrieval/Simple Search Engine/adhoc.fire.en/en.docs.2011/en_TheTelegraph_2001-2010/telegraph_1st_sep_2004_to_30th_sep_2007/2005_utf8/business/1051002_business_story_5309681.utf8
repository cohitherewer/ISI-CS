 New Delhi, Oct. 1: Mahindra and Mahindra (M amp;M) wants to make Mahindra Systems and Automotive Technologies (MSAT) a billion-dollar company by 2010.

 MSAT has a turnover of $250 million now. We have made an internal commitment to the board to grow to a billion-dollar company by 2010. Therefore, we are looking at both organic and inorganic growth, MSAT president Hemant Luthra said.

 MSAT is close to acquiring companies in the engineering services and auto component sector. You can expect our first announcement in the next four weeks, Luthra said, adding that at least two acquisitions will occur by the year-end.

 He, however, refused to divulge whether the first acquisition will be at home or abroad. We are in the final round of talks and are considering companies both in Germany and Detroit, Luthra said.

 The company will also raise its capacity. We are looking at merging MForge with M amp;M and doubling the capacity of MForge, he added.

 According to him, acquisition in the engineering services sector, which is growing at $15 million, would be the key driver of growth for M amp;M.

 On whether MSAT will become a separate company, Luthra said, Only time will tell. 

 We are not worried about finances for acquisitions. Some of the funds will come from internal accruals and some from M amp;M, he added.

 M amp;M vice-chairman and MD Anand Mahindra said, We are focusing on organic growth in the tractor business and consolidating our market share.

 Asked if M amp;M will introduce any low-cost tractors in keeping with the market trends, he said, If there is a market, M amp;M will be there. As of now we have no specific plan, but we are exploring the options. We intend to be present everywhere.

 Mahindra said the focus continues to be on the US market though the companys major thrust is on eastern Europe. We are also eyeing Egypt and Turkey. But India remains our main market as it is growing. We also expect a good season and agriculture to do good, he said.

 M amp;Ms market share in the tractor segment had touched around 32 per cent last month. On the companys bid for the Romanian governments stake in tractor company Tractorul, he said, We are very much in the process and things are underway.

 According to him, if the acquisition goes through, Romania will become a major focus in the east European region.

 He clarified that the company has no plans for the two-wheeler segment at present. There is no initiative as of now. It is too premature, said Mahindra.

 He, however, said in the sports-utility vehicle segment, M amp;M will continue to introduce new variants and retain its dominant market share.

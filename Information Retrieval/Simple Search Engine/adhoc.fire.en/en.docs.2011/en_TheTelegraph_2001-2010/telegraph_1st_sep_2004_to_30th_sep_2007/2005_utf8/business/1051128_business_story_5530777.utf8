The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Wolf cry lost in bull stampede

 The story about the fall in the sensex and its rapid rebound can be summed up in one line ? in October the FIIs sold a net Rs 3,693.90 crore worth of equities, while in November (till the 24th) they had bought a net Rs 3,338.80 crore. Moreover, the bounce in the Indian market reflects the rebound in emerging markets. The difference is that India fell harder last month and so has rebounded higher this month. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has gone up 7.63 per cent this month (till November 25) while the MSCI India Index has gone up 12.34 per cent.

 Clearly, the October scare about rising US interest rates has dissipated, and, in fact, the minutes of the last US Federal Reserve meeting give reason to hope that the end of the US monetary tightening cycle is near.

 If that happens, the cycle would have ended with record global liquidity and very high asset prices. The fact that this has not translated into higher inflation is a sign that globalisation has changed the world dramatically. Too many analysts have cried wolf too often during this two-and-a-half year rally. Could it be that those who argue that ?its different this time? are right? 

 ICICI Bank lending

 ICICI Bank?s recent filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission show a sharp rise in its non-performing consumer loans and impaired credit card receivables. During the six months to September 30, 2005, these impaired loans rose by 35 per cent, from Rs 544.9 crore on March 31, 2005 to Rs 736.9 crore on September 30, 2005. 

 Moreover, impaired consumer loans and credit card receivables have grown at a time when ICICI Bank?s total gross impaired assets have shown a drop. As a result, the proportion of impaired consumer loans and credit card receivables has risen from 18.3 per cent of total impaired assets on March 31, 2005 to 33.9 per cent six months later.

 Analysts point out that impaired loans in consumer lending and credit cards are still a very small proportion of banks? gross lending. Non-performing consumer and credit card assets were just 1.1 per cent of gross consumer and credit card outstandings on September 30, 2005. However, on an incremental basis, the proportion is higher ? during the first half of the year, the rise in impaired assets in the segment was 1.4 per cent of the rise in loans.

 HDFC?s gross NPL/total loans ratio has also increased, and was 1.52 per cent at the end of September compared with 1.10 per cent at the end of March. However, it declined from 1.74 per cent as at the end of the June quarter.

 The rise in non-performing retail assets comes at a time when the Reserve Bank of India has been sounding the warning bells about the runaway rise in credit to the sector. 

 The RBI?s mid-term review of monetary policy pointed out that asset prices, especially housing prices, have registered a substantial increase.

 In this connection, consumer loans and credit card receivables accounted for 80 per cent of the rise in ICICI Banks total lending in the first half of 2005-06.

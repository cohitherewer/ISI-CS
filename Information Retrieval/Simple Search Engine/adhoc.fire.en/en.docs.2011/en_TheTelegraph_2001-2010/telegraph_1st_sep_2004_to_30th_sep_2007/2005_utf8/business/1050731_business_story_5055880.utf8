 New VW point man arrives today

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, July 30: Former German ambassador to India, Frank Elbe, who has been appointed as the representative of the German auto giant Volkswagen AG in India, is arriving in Hyderabad tomorrow on a two-day visit.

 Elbe replaced Helmuth Schuster, the former Volkswagen point man in India who had to make an unceremonious exit after the German car maker unearthed a bribery scandal that involved Vashisht Wahan, a company allegedly floated by Schuster.

 Elbe is slated to visit Vishakhapatnam, the proposed site for Volkswagen?s manufacturing plant in India, to make an on-the-spot inspection, an official spokesman said .

 ?The news of Elbe?s visit to Hyderabad immediately after taking charge of the company?s India operations has raised our hopes of getting the project back in Andhra Pradesh,? said D. Somayajulu, the economic affairs and foreign investment adviser to the state government.

 Earlier this week, Volkswagen chief executive Bernd Pischetsrieder had communicated to chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy about Elbe?s appointment to take forward the India car project.

 The Volkswagen chief said the India project had been put on hold temporarily but he expressed serious intentions to enter the Indian market. Volkswagen had also agreed to compensate the 2 million euro paid by the state to Vashisht Wahan.

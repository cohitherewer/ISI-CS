The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 CESC looks beyond home circuit, four states on list

 Calcutta, April 18: CESC is planning to step out of Bengal. The century-old company has narrowed down its list of destinations for a generating unit to Karnataka, Haryana, Rajasthan and Maharashtra.

 Sources said a 500-MW plant will come up in any one of the four states at a cost of Rs 2,000 crore.

 ?We are looking at opportunities in these states. A survey is being carried out. We are also interacting with the state governments,? Sumantra Banerjee, managing director of CESC, told The Telegraph. ?We are keen on generation. The decision on investing will be taken within this financial year,? he added. 

 However, he refused to comment on the size of the plant. ?It is at a very preliminary stage. I cannot talk about it right now.?

 He said coal will be a major factor in deciding where to set up the unit. ?We are trying to find out which of the four states has the best coal linkage since it is an important raw material for a thermal power plant,? Banerjee said.

 The lenders have not been approached with proposals to finance the new plans, he added. 

 ICICI Bank officials said they had not received a formal proposal from CESC even though they have been hearing about its plan to enter other states.

 The company is in touch with foreign institutional investors (FIIs) to tie up funds for new projects. Banerjee visited Hong Kong, Singapore and Australia to brief the FIIs, particularly Platinum Asset Management about the company?s performance. Platinum holds nearly 6.5 per cent in CESC.

 ?The power sector in India is gradually changing and the FIIs are keen to invest,? Banerjee added. 

 CESC Limited started providing electricity to residents of Calcutta on April 17, 1899. Since then, it has been the only power supplier in the city. Starting with a licensed area of 14.44 sq km and serving a few hundred consumers a century back, CESC today operates over 567 sq. km, serving 17 million consumers. It distributes 1100-1200 MW of electricity and generates 1,000 MW on its own. 

 In 1895, the Bengal Act IX, popularly known as the ?Calcutta Electric Lighting Act? was passed, which authorised the local government to grant licences to companies to sell electricity to Calcutta. In 1897, CESC was granted a licence as The Indian Electric Company. The name was changed to Calcutta Electric Supply Corporation in 1978. In 1987, it was renamed CESC Ltd. CESC was acquired by the RPG group in 1989. 

 The RPG group has a distribution company called Greater Noida Distribution Company, in which the Uttar Pradesh government holds a minority stake.

 New Delhi, Jan. 4: India today offered 20 blocks for oil and gas exploration through the global competition route which are expected to attract an investment of $1 billion.

 Six deep-sea blocks, two shallow water and 12 on-land blocks, have been offered to public and private sector firms under the fifth round of the new exploration licensing policy (Nelp), which will close on May 31, petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar announced at a press conference here today.

 Of the deep-water blocks, two each are on the east and west coasts and two in the Andaman area. The shallow water blocks are on the west coast, while the 12 on-land ones are spread across eight basins ? Assam, Arakan, Cambay, Rajasthan, Kaveri, Ganga valley, Vindhya, Deccan Syneclise and Krishna Godavari.

 ONGC will also offer stakes in five deep-sea blocks, three in Krishna-Godavari basin, one in Kerala Konkan offshore and one in Gujarat Kutch offshore, at roadshows to promote Nelp blocks. Digital data rooms are being set up in Delhi, Houston, London, Calgary and Dubai to provide geological details.

 Roadshows to attract investors will be held in Delhi on January 18, London (January 20-21), Dubai (January 24-25), Houston (January 31 and February 1), Calgary (February 3-4), and possibly in Moscow (February 14), he said.

 Making a hardsell to woo global oil majors, Aiyar flaunted the over 14-trillion cubic feet of gas reserves struck by Reliance Industries and Niko Resources of Canada in the Bay of Bengal and Cairn Energy of the UK making a significant oil discovery in Barmer district of Rajasthan.

 ?Domestic crude oil production is targeted to rise to 50 million tonnes by 2025 from the current plateau of 33 million tonnes,? Aiyar said. However, the over 5 per cent increase in petro-product demand is likely to outpace the incremental production planned and India?s self-sufficiency ratio would fall to 15 per cent, he added. ?We import 70 per cent of our crude oil requirement currently. In 2025, this would rise to 85 per cent,? he said. Over $2.53 billion has already been invested in the blocks awarded in the first four rounds of bidding, he said adding bidding conditions have been made more attractive to draw investors? attention. The government had changed the policy of taking its share of natural gas in cash or kind every year to once in five years, Aiyar said.

 Profit gas is calculated after deducting all expenses incurred on producing that gas. The government has a fixed percentage of profit gas, which a company decides while bidding for a block.

 The government has also relaxed the norm for giving bank guarantee towards minimum work programme. Hitherto, only companies having a net worth of $1 billion were exempt from furnishing the bank guarantee, but from Nelp-5 this threshold value has been reduced to $500 million, he said.

 Turbulence alert for shipping firms 

 VIVEK NAIR 

 Problem of plenty

 Mumbai, Jan. 6: Shipping companies could find themselves in choppy waters soon.

 The bull run in the sector, manifested in the form of high freight rates last year, may lose steam due to excess supply.

 Over the past few years, the shipping industry saw strong demand and rising freight rates with China and its huge appetite for commodities playing a key role. Shipping companies went into an expansionary mode to benefit from the bull run. This led to an increase in supply. 

 For instance, in November, a leading shipping company decided to buy an Aframax crude carrier. It has already placed orders for a second-hand tanker and 15 new building vessels.

 However, analysts are now sounding a note of caution. Dry bulk rates have softened from their historic highs and tanker rates have dropped 75 per cent from the peak in November.

 A research report on the shipping sector by Deutsche Bank says the de-rating starts this year and the rise in supply will put pressure on rates and the sector should be ready for disappointments.

 The report, tracking developments in container, dry-bulk and tanker segments, added that in containers, the supply growth is accelerating and 2006 will see the fastest growth in 20 years.

 Assuming that demand stays robust, rates will be flat in 2005 before falling in 2006. The decline could come sooner in 2005, the report said.

 Deutsche Bank is also bearish on the fortunes of the dry-bulk segment where it expects rates to drop this year as more supply enters the market and demand growth moderates. 

 With the ratio between the orderbook and fleet ratio rising and freight rates softening, it is expected that this segment will also feel the pressure. 

 However, China will play a key role here. If the country slows down its commodity imports, it could affect the shipping industry.

 A similar situation prevails in the tanker sector. Companies in this segment have been replacing their ageing single-hull tankers for double-hull vessels. 

 Tanker rates have fallen and industry sources feel this is largely due to a less severe winter in the US. While deliveries of the new double-hull vessels will more than cover replacement needs for the next few years, the fleet growth is likely to be at historically high levels. 

 ?Strong demand from China and India will continue to drive the tanker trade growth, but they still represent a relatively small portion of global trade,? it added.

 However, domestic shipping companies are not too worried. Sources here told The Telegraph that the softening of freight rates was due to the ?bunching of vessels at one particular time?. 

 ?The freight rates came down because they went up too fast. There is not much change in the fundamentals. For example, ship building prices have not shown any change,? an official of one of the leading companies pointed out. 

 He added that average freight rates so far this fiscal have risen over the last year. In the tanker segment, the average rate up to December 15 was $1,23,000 per day compared with $ 73,000 for a very large crude carrier.

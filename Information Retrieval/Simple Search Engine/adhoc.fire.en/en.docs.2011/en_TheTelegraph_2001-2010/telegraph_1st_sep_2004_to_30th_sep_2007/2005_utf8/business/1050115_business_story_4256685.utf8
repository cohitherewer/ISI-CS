 FM session caps Anil power meet

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Jan. 14: A meeting with finance minister P. Chidambaram capped Anil Ambani?s talks with movers and shakers in the government today. 

 According to sources, he even met senior finance ministry officials, though there was no word on what transpired. 

 The trip to the capital came a day after Anil shot off a letter to elder brother and Reliance Industries chairman, Mukesh Ambani, in which he targeted Anand Jain.

 The salvo was the second broadside at Mukesh?s confidant, who has been accused of sullying the group?s image and driving a wedge between the brothers.

 On Thursday, Anil took a swipe at Jain?s role as a distributor of IPCL even as he sat on the board of the firm as a director. He drew attention to the obvious ?conflict of interest? between the two functions. On January 3, Anil had resigned as vice-chairman of IPCL, saying it was ?below his dignity? to work with Jain.

 The fresh attack came even as reports suggested that a formula for legal separation was being worked out by ICICI Bank chairman K. V. Kamath at the behest of Kokilaben ?Dhirubhai Ambani?s widow.

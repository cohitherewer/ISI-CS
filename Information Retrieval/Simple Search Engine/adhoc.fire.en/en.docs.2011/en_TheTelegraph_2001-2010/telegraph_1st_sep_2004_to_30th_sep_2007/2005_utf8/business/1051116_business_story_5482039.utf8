 WorldSpace bets big on India operations

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 15: WorldSpace, a global satellite-based digital radio services company from the US, will invest $100-150 million in its Indian operations over the next couple of years.

 The company, which has 40 radio stations transmitting to 130 countries through three satellites, is currently present in eight cities in India.

 WorldSpace chairman and chief executive officer Noah Samara said, We have already invested $200 million in India. Further investments will be mainly for developing technology to enable implementation of services, content development and marketing.

 The satellite radio company has chosen Webel Mediatronics as a partner to manufacture transmitters and repeaters at their Taratolla plant.

 The plant will mainly manufacture a range of gap-fillers like transmitters and repeaters. Around 120 such units are required to create a network that will cover the Indian sub-continent. We are in the process of working out the details of manufacturing. The first step will involve transfer of technology from our centre at Canada. A new facility may be contemplated once the technology details are in place, Samara said.

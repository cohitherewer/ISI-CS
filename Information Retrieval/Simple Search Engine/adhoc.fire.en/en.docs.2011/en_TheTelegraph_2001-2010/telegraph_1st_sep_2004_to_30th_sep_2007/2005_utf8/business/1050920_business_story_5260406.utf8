 New Delhi, Sept. 19: Lighten up folks: now you can finally dump that overused wallet which leaves an unsightly bulge in your trousers. Pay for your purchases through your mobile phone.The concept of using the mobile as a virtual wallet has grown into a worldwide trend and it has now been launched in India.

 AirTel, ICICI Bank and Visa today joined hands to launch mChq ? a credit card operated through the mobile phone. The service is fully secure since every transaction is pre-approved by the cardholder and digitally signed for through a personalised personal identification number.

 This is the first service in India that offers a mobile-to-mobile payment option. The service enables AirTel customers and ICICI Bank Visa cardholders to pay for their purchases with their phones.

 How does it work? The transaction is pretty simple: when you decide to buy something, the retailer or merchant sends a short message service (SMS) to your mobile mentioning the amount to be paid. 

 The customer enters his PIN and sends an SMS back to the retailer acknowledging the amount to be paid. Both the customer and merchant then get a confirmatory SMS indicating the completion of the transaction. 

 The amount and transaction is later reflected in the credit card statement of the customer. The customer pays the amount through cheque or cash when the monthly statement is received from the credit card company. The mChq technology is powered by A.Little.World. Company. 

 Any transaction of this kind is authenticated by the Institute for Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT, a technology arm of Reserve Bank of India). 

 IDRBT is the principal certification authority for the use of the public key infrastructure (PKI) in mChq. PKI is a combination of numbers, words, symbols that forms one key in a pair of keys. The other key in this pair (which is also a combination of numbers, words, symbols) is present in the digital signature that will authenticate a user.

 Akhil Gupta, joint managing director, Bharti Tele-Ventures said, ?With the launch of this new service, mobile phones will now turn into virtual wallets and there is chance that the entire concept of payment may change. The product is a boon for customers, financial service providers, retailers and mobile service providers.? 

 Chanda Kochhar, executive director of ICICI Bank, said, ?mChq will completely transform the way people shop. This service provides value-addition to the way we use credit cards and mobile phones. With the rapid penetration of mobile phones, ICICI Bank sees a great potential in servicing customers in this segment.?

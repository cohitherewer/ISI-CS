 Good response to oil bonds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 12: The bonds issued by Indian Oil for mobilising Rs 1,000 crore have been oversubscribed 2.5 times to touch the Rs 2,500-crore mark. However, IOC plans to retain only Rs 1,225 crore.

 IOCs book-building issue of secured redeemable non-convertible bonds was open for subscription on a private placement basis during September 6-9. 

 Rated LAAA by ICRA, the issue had a provision for a green-shoe option.

 These bonds were launched in two categories ? one had a five-year maturity period with a put-and-call option at the end of each year. It carried a floating rate of interest to be reset semi-annually. The other had a 10-year maturity period with a fixed coupon rate.

 The interest rates were 10 basis points over one-year gilt yield for the first option and 7.40 per cent per annum for the second option.

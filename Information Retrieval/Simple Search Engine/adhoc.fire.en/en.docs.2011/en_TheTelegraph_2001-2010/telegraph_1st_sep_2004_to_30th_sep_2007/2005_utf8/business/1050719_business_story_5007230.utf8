 Ground realities send airport revamp into a tailspin

 New Delhi, July 18: The privatisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports seems to have run into new air pockets.

 Several members of the group of ministers on the issue have pointed out that Mumbai airport?s runways cannot be expanded much unless the slums surrounding it are removed. Delhi will need a new airport by 2012 to take care of the fast expanding traffic. That obviates the need to revamp the existing one.

 Sources said this has created a situation where while the GoM has not objected to the privatisation bid, which is under way, it has raised some fundamental questions that may affect the actual privatisation process. 

 Slums surrounding Mumbai airport have prevented the development of more runway space, which is badly needed at the overcrowded Santa Cruz airport. However, fear of political backlash has kept successive state governments from razing them down. 

 GoM sources said bidders, who are expected to shoulder the responsibility of removing the slums, are against the clause. 

 Similarly, several members of the GoM as well as technical experts have pointed out that Delhi will need a new airport by 2012 given the huge rise in both international and domestic traffic to the capital. 

 ?It now seems privatisation of these airports may not give desired results, the GoM itself accepts the problems ... there is a need for a rethink,? says Nilotpal Basu, CPM leader in the upper house and chairman of the standing committee on transport. 

 The government wants a 74 per cent stake in Delhi and Mumbai airports to be sold to private entrepreneurs, including up to 10 per cent to airlines and 49 per cent to foreign stakeholders. 

 Bidders are likely to include Anil Dhirubhai Ambani group, DLF-Malaysia Airport Holdings Berhad (which runs the Kuala Lumpur airport) combine, Hyderabad-based GMR group in collaboration with Fraport AG (which runs the Frankfurt airport) and Bharti Enterprises in collaboration with Singapore?s Changi Airport.

 The Left has always been against the privatisation bid but had stopped turning it into an issue. However, the discordant voices within the GoM has bolstered their objections. Sources close to the GoM said in case serious bids were not received or only single eligible bids were received then a rethink may indeed be needed.

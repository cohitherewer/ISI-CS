 DCB awaits funds infusion

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 9: Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development (Akfed), the principal promoter of Development Credit Bank (DCB), has proposed to inject new capital into the bank to support growth. 

 The decision to infuse funds followed a strategic review of the bank?s operations and its capital structure by the international consulting firm, McKinsey and Company. 

 It is also the outcome of changes in regulations concerning ownership of Indian banks recently published by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), DCB chairman Naushad I. Padamsee said.

 Akfed is in the process of applying to the RBI to infuse Rs 140 crore ($32 million) capital into the bank. This will permit DCB to actively pursue growth strategies across chosen business lines, including retail and commercial banking and treasury, identified in the strategic review. 

 It will also create provisions against the banks legacy of non-performing assets.

 Cut call 

 New Delhi, March 1: Japanese carmakers Toyota and Honda were the first to announce sharp cuts in car prices a day after finance minister P. Chidambaram slashed the peak customs duty from 20 per cent to 15 per cent.

 Toyota Kirloskar Motor, the Bangalore-based carmaker, slashed the prices of the Corolla and the Innova.

 The price of the Corolla was cut by approximately Rs 32,000 on the ex-showroom price. The Innova ? the sedan with the features of a multi-utility vehicle that was launched just last week ? will be reduced by Rs 14,000 on the ex-showroom price.

 ?We have studied the impact of the customs duty cut. We are passing on the benefit of this reduction to our customers,? said Toyota Kirloskar managing director A. Toyoshima.

 The price of the Corolla will range between Rs 9.73 lakh and Rs 11.76 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). The petrol version of Innova is priced between Rs 6.69 lakh and Rs 9.31 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). The diesel version is priced between Rs 7.29 lakh and Rs 9.91 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi). The on-road prices will vary depending on the prevailing local taxes.

 The other Japanese carmaker ? Honda Siel Cars India ? has announced a price cut of Rs 1,000 to Rs 8,000 for its premium and luxury brands City and Accord. 

 The City 1.5 Exi, which had a price tag of Rs 6,52,021, will cost Rs 3000 less at Rs 6,49,500. The other two variants of the City has also seen price slashes by about Rs 1000.

 For Hondas luxury car Accord, the VTi-l, manual variant, has seen a price cut of about Rs 8000 at the new price of Rs 14,71,000 and by about the same amount for VTi-l automatic variant, which will now cost Rs 15,42,000.

 The price of the top-end Accord car V6 has been cut by Rs 8020 to Rs 16,99,001. 

 H. Yamada, president and CEO of Honda Siel Cars India, said, ?The 5 per cent cut in the peak customs duty is being passed on to the consumer.?

 In the budget, customs duties on raw materials and inputs came down from 20 to 15 per cent. 

 Excise duty on cars was left untouched at 24 per cent. The finance minister did, however, dangle the carrot by saying, ?Carmakers will have to wait for the excise duties to come down.?

 Hyundai and Maruti said they were not planning any cuts, but industry sources said there could be some price cuts in high-end cars depending on the quantum of imported inputs they use. 

 Hyundai has postponed the launch of the economy model Elantra, slated for this month, a company spokesperson confirmed.

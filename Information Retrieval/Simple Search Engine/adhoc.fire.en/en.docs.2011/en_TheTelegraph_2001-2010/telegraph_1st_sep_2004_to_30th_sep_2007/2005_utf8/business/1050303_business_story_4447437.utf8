 Calcutta airport smoothes feathers to receive big bird

 Giant wheel

 New Delhi, March 2: The Airbus A 380 ? the world?s largest passenger plane ? could soon touch down in Calcutta.

 Four international airports ?Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai ? are being spruced up to be able to receive the giant plane that has a wingspan of 261 feet long, length of over 239 feet and a height of over 79 feet at the tail.

 Officials said a suitable bay area was being identified in Calcutta, while bay areas have been identified in the other three metropolitan cities and work has already begun.

 ?Studies have already been carried out for adequacy of runaway length, taxiway width, turning radius and apron parking positions at these airports, quot; civil aviation minister Praful Patel said.

 The planned Bangalore international airport will also build bays to park the double-decker aircraft that can seat up to 555 passengers. Airbus is offering the A380 to airlines as its answer to air travel congestion and forecasts that passenger traffic worldwide will double in 15 years.

 The massive jet will begin to fly commercially only in 2006 but airports across the world are already scrambling to carry out remodifications to be able to receive the plane.

 Toulouse-based Airbus Industries launched the superjumbo in mid-January and has already firmed up orders for more than 150 aircraft across the world.

 The European aircraft maker, which has bagged the mega-Indian Airlines contract to sell 43 planes valued at over Rs 9,000 crore, has been trying to interest Indian carriers to consider buying the Airbus A380. 

 The aircraft maker wants Air India to consider revising its purchase plans and consider A380 for high-density routes like to the Gulf and South East Asia. 

 Although it has pitted its A330 and A340 against Boeing products for the Air India contract for 28 long haul aircraft, Airbus says airlines in India should also consider the new product in the light of new dynamics in the aviation market. 

 Air Indias proposal to expand its fleet is likely to be cleared by the government within the next few months. Air India wants to buy up to 35 aircraft over the next few years worth more than $2.2 billion. It will be placing orders for 10 long range planes with an option to pick up another seven. The financial bids closed today. 

 The two planes in the fray are Boeing 777 ER and Airbus 340, though sources said the government would prefer to buy the Boeing.

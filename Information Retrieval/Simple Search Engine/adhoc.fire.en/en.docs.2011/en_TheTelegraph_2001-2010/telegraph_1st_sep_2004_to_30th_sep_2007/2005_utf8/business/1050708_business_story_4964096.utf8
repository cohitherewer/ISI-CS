 New Delhi, July 7: Yamaha Motor Company, the second largest two-wheeler maker in the world, will invest Rs 400 crore in India and increase the production at one of its manufacturing facilities.

 India is a key market for Yamaha and our position has improved here. Therefore, we are investing more, said H. Yanagi, chief executive officer and managing director of Yamaha Motor India (YMI).

 At present, Yamaha has two plants in Faridabad and Surajpur in Greater Noida, which rolls out 3,50,000 vehicles. The company wants to increase the capacity to half-a-million vehicles annually.

 The company is likely to raise the capacity of the Surajpur plant, said officials.

 Yamaha wants to spruce up production in India, as it wants to make the country an export hub to cater to the European market, Yanagi said.

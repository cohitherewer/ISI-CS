 Subsidy burden on refineries 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 9: The government is working on a proposal to rope in stand-alone refineries such as Reliance and Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) to foot part of the subsidy bill on kerosene and LPG borne entirely by the public sector companies.

 The stand-alone refineries have been raking in huge profits ? the lucrative refinery margins that they are currently getting on account of the import parity prices that they are entitled to for their products ? under the current system.

 Petroleum secretary S. C. Tripathi today said that the government was thinking in terms of motivating the stand-alone refineries to share at least a part of the subsidy burden so that a more equitable formula could be evolved for the pricing of petroleum products.

 While these standalone refineries get import parity prices, which include a notional customs duty that is added on as well, downstream oil companies ? Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and IBP ? have to sell LPG and kerosene at prices that are far below the market rates. 

 In recent months, this cash drain has also been extended to diesel and petrol as they have not been allowed to increase the prices of these transport fuels due to political reasons. This cash drain is reflected in the bottomlines, which have nose-dived ever since crude prices have started soaring last year. 

 IOC covers part of its losses as it has a large refining capacity and its refining division gets the benefit of high refining margins. However, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum, which have lesser refining capacity, offset their losses only to that extent and have been facing a faster erosion in profits. 

 IBP, which has no refining capacity at all, is the worst hit and has run into losses despite being an efficient company merely because of the current pricing formula.

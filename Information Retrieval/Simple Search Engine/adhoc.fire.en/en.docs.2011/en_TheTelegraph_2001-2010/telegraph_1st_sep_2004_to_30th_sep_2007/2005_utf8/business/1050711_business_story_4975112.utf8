 AirTel card for netizens on the move

 M. RAJENDRAN

 New Delhi, July 10: AirTel will launch a data card targeted at the frequent travellers with laptops and notebooks to get hooked to Internet on its wireless network.

 The data card is a slim size device, much like a credit card that fits the slot on most laptops. This slot is a standard devised by personal computer memory card international association (PCMCIA) of 500 companies. Originally designed for adding memory to portable computers, the PCMCIA standard has been expanded several times and is now suitable for many types of devices.

 The instant wireless internet connectivity data card is compatible with enhanced data rate for global evolution services (EDGE) and general packet radio services (GPRS) networks. The two are the latest wireless systems that offer download speeds of 100-154 kilo bytes per second (kbps). Users will be able to stay connected across the country, and also when roaming internationally.

 The subscribers of this service can send and receive short message service (SMS) from laptops by using the data card, which is available with a warranty of two years.

 ?The data card is a product born out of compulsion to retain the mobile-business customers. The Blackberry has become a niche product and is unable to penetrate all segments. The data card follows feedback from customers. 

 AirTel disagrees, saying it has subscribers of over 10,000 customers for Blackberry. The firm insists Blackberry is a product in itself, and cannot be compared to a data card.

 Blackberry is available in two variants, which are priced at Rs 9,900-19,000. The rental is Rs 900 to Rs 2000, depending on the tariff plan. AirTels data card will compete with the existing ones in the market ? Vdata from Tata Indicom and R-connect from Reliance Infocomm. (See Chart)

 Atul Bindal, director and group chief marketing officer- mobility, Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd, said: ?The data card will enable the most comprehensive wireless data connectivity for people on the move and that, too, all across the country and while roaming internationally.?

 The card will be launched simultaneously in 13 cities of the country. The company is likely to announce three tariff packages next week, besides a one-time entry fee of Rs 12,999.

 Hello tunes

 Last week, AirTel Broadband and Telephone Services announced the launch of ?hello tunes? services for fixed line subscribers. It is a personalised service where the caller hears songs and other sound clips instead of traditional ring tones.

 Tata Steel completes NatSteel acquisition

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 16: Tata Iron and Steel Company (Tisco) has completed the acquisition of Singapore-based NatSteel by picking up a 100 per cent stake in its subsidiary, NatSteel Asia.

 As part of the deal, all steel assets of NatSteel in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Phillipines, Australia and China (except Changzhou Wujin NatSteel) have been transferred to NatSteel Asia, Tisco informed the Bombay Stock Exchange today.

 Earlier, Tisco had entered into a definitive share subscription agreement to acquire the steel business of NatSteel, the company said.

 Among the China investments, approvals for the transfer of Southern NatSteel (Xiamen) Company Ltd and Wuxi Jingyang Metal Products Company Ltd to NatSteel Asia have come through.

 The exception is Changzhou Wujin NatSteel, whose integration with NatSteel Asia has been delayed because watchdogs in China have not yet taken a call on the issue so far.

 As a result, the company has held back Singapore $60 million from the purchase amount for the transaction. Instead, it signed a supplementary subscription agreement with NatSteel on February 15.

 According to the agreement first signed on August 16 last year, the negotiated enterprise value of NatSteel was Singapore $486.4 million.

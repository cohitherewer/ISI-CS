 TASC Pharma to shop for funds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 13: TASC Pharmaceuticals is planning to raise money through foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCB) or global depository receipts (GDR) to fund its acquisition plans and beef up research.

 The company today informed stock exchanges that its board will meet on Thursday to consider the fund-raising plans, which could help it buy firms in the US or Europe.

 The money could also bolster research, expand its active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) business and scale up its presence in the area of bio-pharmaceuticals. 

 Last month, TASC merged Glenmark Labs with itself in a move that instantly gave it the ability to produce the entire array of medicines, from bulk drugs to formulations. 

 Glenmark makes formulations while TASC is known to specialise in active pharmaceutical ingredients.

 The amalgamation was projected as a win-win deal for both firms since it integrated Glenmark backwards and TASC Pharmaceuticals forward in the drug-production chain.

 Officials making the merger announcement said the combined entity will leverage Glenmark?s tie-ups with companies in the UK, Australia, Brazil and Southeast Asia to supply TASC?s range of pharmaceutical ingredients.

 The research skills of both firms will be tapped by the merged entity to emerge as a key player in contract research and manufacturing-related services. Already, two new chemical entities are being developed. Of these, one is in the second phase and the other in the third.

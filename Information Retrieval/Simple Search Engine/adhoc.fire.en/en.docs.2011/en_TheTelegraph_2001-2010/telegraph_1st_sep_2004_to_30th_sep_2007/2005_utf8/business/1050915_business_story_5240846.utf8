 Growth buffer for oil strain

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The government feels that a booming economy will moderate the impact of higher petrol prices and ensure stable interest rates. 

 Union finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the impact of a 7 per cent increase in retail petrol and diesel prices would raise inflation rates moderately in two to three weeks.

 But he saw no upward pressure on interest rates and did not anticipate any more government borrowings than the budget target this year. ?I dont see any pressure. No banker has told me there is a problem of liquidity,? he said on the sidelines of a conference of government auditors here.

 However, the market is speculating that the Reserve Bank will raise short-term interest rates from 5 per cent at its next policy review in October in a bid to contain inflation. Traditional economic logic dictates that the government sucks out excess money in the system by raising interest rates, which in turn flattens demand and rising prices.

 The Institute of Economic Growth has forecast that the fuel price rise would push wholesale price inflation up to 4 per cent from about 3 per cent.

 ?Our economic fundamentals are strong ? foreign exchange reserves buoyant, exports rising, balance of payment position robust, rupee strong and inflation moderate. Government revenue till August was in keeping with the budget projection,? Chidambaram said.

 He also said there was no pressure on government finances. ?As of now, we don?t need to borrow more. In the first half, we have stuck to the budget target,? he added.

 The government wants to sustain a high growth by emphasising more on agriculture, maintaining buoyancy in industrial production and sustaining the high growth in the services sector, he said. The Reserve Bank projects a 7 per cent growth in economy this year on the back of a good monsoon and higher consumer spending.

 Chidambaram, who was inaugurating a workshop on accounting systems organised by the controller-general of accounts and the World Bank, also said, ?The corporate sector has for many years practised the accrual-based accounting system ... The government is determined to switch over to the new system and I hope states will follow.?

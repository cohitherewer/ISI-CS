 Profit hunters swoop on peak

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 27: The sensex flirted with the 7200-mark today as markets swung to the beat of profit hunters who eventually forced the market to close almost flat.

 At 7151.08, the key stock barometer still totted up its highest close ever. So did it its counterpart on the NSE, nifty, which scaled life-time highs at 2219.65 before ending at 2199.80. 

 Market watchers are optimistic about the bull-run, saying stocks still have a lot going for them. However, they temper the excitement over soaring indices with a warning to retail investors, who have been advised to be careful.

 Foreign institutional investors have shown a lot of interest and we also have the monsoon progressing on time. The row at Reliance has been settled, too, a broker said.

 The spotlight refused to go away from Reliance, whose group firms have stolen the show on exchanges and turnover charts ever since ownership issues between the Ambani brothers appeared heading for a resolution.

 Reliance Capital, now in Anil Ambanis stable, saw 220.23 lakh of its shares transacted in deals that were worth over Rs 827 crore. Following it was Reliance Industries (RIL), where 49.19 lakh shares valued at Rs 325.60 crore changed hands. Deals in IPCL were worth Rs 195.43 crore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 State sticks to original VAT turnover limit

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Dasgupta: In control

 Calcutta, March 29: Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta today decided against using the state?s discretionary power to waive value-added tax (VAT) for businesses with an annual turnover of up to Rs 10 lakh.

 Instead, he chose to retain the limit of Rs 5 lakh that had been originally proposed by the empowered committee of state finance ministers.

 Replying to the closing debate over the state budget in the Assembly, Dasgupta said 0.25 per cent composition rate of VAT would be imposed on trade grossing between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 50 lakh. 

 The empowered committee, which is chaired by Dasgupta, at its meeting on March 24, decided to provide discretionary power to states to raise the complete waiver limit to Rs 10 lakh. Delhi will opt for it, though the Centre would not compensate it for the resultant loss of revenue.

 Dasgupta told the members of the Opposition that the impact of VAT would be negligible as 60 per cent of the state?s trade gross below Rs 50 lakh and would come under the 0.25 per cent category. 

 C.M. Bachawat, Bengal commissioner of commercial taxes, told The Telegraph that under the composition rate, a trader will have to pay just Rs 250 on a turnover of Rs 1 lakh.

 However, the composition rate would be applicable to resellers, who are engaged in buying and selling goods within Bengal. Dealers effecting inter-state sales or purchases are not eligible for this scheme. Similarly, work contractors registered under the VAT act will have the option to pay tax at a compounded rate of 2 per cent on the entire contract price received or receivable. Such traders will be required to apply before the commissioner of commercial taxes to become eligible for composition tax within two months from April 1. 

 Seeking support of the Opposition, especially the Congress and Trinamul Congress, Dasgupta said the impact of VAT would mean a higher revenue for the government without any increase in prices for the consumers. While under the existing sales tax system there is double taxation on both input and output, under VAT the input tax is negated.

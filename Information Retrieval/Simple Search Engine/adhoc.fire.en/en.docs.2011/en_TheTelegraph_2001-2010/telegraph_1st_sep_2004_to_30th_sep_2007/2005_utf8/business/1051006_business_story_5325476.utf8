 Calcutta, Oct. 5: Haldia is likely to get investment of Rs 10,000 crore in the next five years, Laxman Seth, chairman of Haldia Development Authority (HDA) said here today.

 So far the port town has received Rs 15,000 crore investment. The new investment will come from companies in the oil, chemical and petrochemical sectors, such as Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd, Mitsubishi PTA Corporation Ltd and Indian Oil Corporation, Seth said.

 In order to create a suitable infrastructure to facilitate investments, HDA will pump in Rs 500 crore. 

 Speaking at a meeting organised by the eastern region chapter of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Seth said 50 per cent of its own investments would come through borrowed capital.

 We have identified and firmed up projects worth Rs 68 crore so far, he said.

 The city development body has appointed Srei Capital to evaluate the option for a bond flotation. 

 HDA has also entered into a joint venture with IL amp;FS for investment in infrastructure projects at Haldia. It has, so far, invested Rs 300 crore for the development of Haldia.

 HDA has created a land bank to facilitate setting up of industries. 

 We are always keeping 1,500 acre with us for distribution to industrial units and are charging Rs 7 lakh per acre from large companies and Rs 6 lakh per acre from smaller companies, Seth said.

 He announced a big meet at the port town on November 10. Sixty companies have confirmed their participation.

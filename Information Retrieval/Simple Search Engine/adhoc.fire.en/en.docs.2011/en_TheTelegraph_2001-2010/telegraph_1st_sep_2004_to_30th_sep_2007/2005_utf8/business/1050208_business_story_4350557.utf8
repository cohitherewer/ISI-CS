 Oil majors pulled up over clean-fuel delay

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: The petroleum ministry has pulled up public sector oil companies for expressing their inability to meet the April 1 deadline for introducing cleaner petrol and diesel in the country.

 Oil companies are required to supply petrol and diesel that conform to Euro-III norms in 11 metros and Euro-II grade fuels in the rest of the country by the deadline. 

 The firms want the ministry to ask the Supreme Court to extend the deadline so that they get more time to start supplying these fuels. 

 However, the ministry is of the view that the deadline was fixed after consulting the oil companies on the issue. As recently as November last year, their CEOs had given the assurance that they would be able to deliver the cleaner fuels by April 1.

 The ministry now wants oil companies to face the music for missing the deadline as going to the Supreme Court appears to be an embarrassment after having made the commitment to introduce these fuels by the deadline.

 The ministry has also asked oil companies to start supplying the Euro-III levels to as many cities as possible. Sources say this would at least convey to the Supreme Court that both the government and the oil companies have taken the decision of the apex court very seriously and avoid facing unpleasant strictures. 

 The public sector oil companies have made huge investments to upgrade the quality of their fuels but the project work has taken longer than expected. 

 Cities in which petrol and diesel supplies have to be brought in line with Euro-III norms include Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Pune, Ahmedabad, Surat, Kanpur and Agra. 

 However, in order to meet the April 1 deadline, the depots of the oil companies should have been stocked with cleaner fuels by January 1. 

 This has not happened. In fact, Indian Oil?s attempts to import Euro-III diesel has come a cropper as the fuel was not available in sufficient quantities in the international market.

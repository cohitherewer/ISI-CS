 Mutual funds breathe easy

 New Delhi, Dec. 13 (PTI): In a relief to the mutual fund industry, the government today amended the income tax rules to make investments in equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS) issued on or after April 2005 eligible for tax exemption under section 80c of the income tax act.

 According to the rules laid down in 1992 and 1998, investments in ELSS were eligible for tax rebate under section 88 of the Income-Tax Act, if such investments were made on or before April 2005. However, section 88 has been replaced by section 80c in the last budget. Accordingly, ELSS rules were notified in November and amended today.

 The finance ministry has clarified that tax benefits under section 80c of the IT act will be available to investments made on or after April 1, 2005, in units of a mutual fund or the Unit Trust, if such units are issued under any plan formulated in accordance with the three schemes ? ELSS-1992, ELSS-1992 as modified in 1998 and ELSS-2005.

 ELSS rules were notified in November to clear the air on tax exemption, but it also mentioned that the schemes can no longer be open-ended. It will be a plan with a fixed tenure of 10 years. However, CBDT has clarified that investments made on or after April 1, 2005, in plans, which are in accordance with ELSS 1992/1998 are also eligible for tax benefits under section 80c of the income-tax act, whether open ended or close ended.

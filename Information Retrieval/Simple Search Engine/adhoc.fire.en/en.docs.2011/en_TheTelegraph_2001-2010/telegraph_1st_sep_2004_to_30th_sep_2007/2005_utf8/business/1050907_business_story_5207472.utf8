 Relief rally in oil stocks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Sept. 6: The oil spill started receding from Dalal Street today. Shares of petroleum firms recovered after the Centre raised prices of petrol by Rs 3 and diesel by Rs 2 per litre.

 The hike is being seen as a positive for oil companies, whose troubles would have grown had the revision not come through. That the relief was not enough was evident when shares of some of these firms ended lower.

 Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has already suffered a net loss in the first quarter amid predictions the hit would go up to Rs 20,000 crore for this financial year if fuel prices were not jacked up immediately. The oil industry would have been poorer by Rs 40,000 crore.

 The Centres decision today did leave many happy faces in oil companies, which would have actually liked the hike to be much larger. In the market, the recovery in oil stocks fuelled a broad-based rally, but a cautious approach to stock-picking as the sensex closed in on 8000 made it difficult for the momentum to be sustained to the end.

 Shares of HPCL hit an intra-day peak of Rs 307.85 after announcement of the fuel price increases. It opened at Rs 298 and closed at Rs 300.75, up Rs 5.60 over its last finish. 

 IBP, the stand-alone marketing company which analysts say would be the worst hit, shares ended at Rs 442.85 after opening at Rs 443. The gain was 0.47 per cent over the last close.

 The IOC stock opened at Rs 435, touched a high of Rs 439 but ended lower at Rs 429.75. The BPCL share shot up to a high of Rs 380.50 after opening at Rs 373.10. It, however, came off the days peak to close a tad higher at Rs 366.30.

 Analysts tracking oil firms welcomed the price revisions but rued the fact that the rise was not big enough for the losses suffered over the past few months to be erased.

 These companies have been struggling to cope with the hit in selling petrol, diesel, cooking gas and kerosene below costs as coalition politics held back a price hike.

 The financial frailties prompted a series of rating setbacks for oil companies. On Monday, Crisil said petrol should be costlier by Rs 5 and diesel by Rs 4 per litre to staunch the flow of red ink on their balance sheets. 

 Amod Khanorkar, head corporate and infrastructure ratings at Crisil, said the governments decision to raise prices was a step in the right direction. More important, todays revision was the second during this year. Fuel prices have risen 7 per cent in the first quarter. 

 He added that though the quantum of hike is not in line with expectations, the oil companies have strong balance sheets and good financial flexibility, which will enable them to mobilise funds from the market at competitive rates. Ballabh Modani of Anand Rathi Securities said the increase still leaves a big gap as it does not cover the entire shortfall. 

 The biggest issue is that prices of kerosene and LPG have not been raised, he observed. Oil firms are suffering a loss of Rs 12.50 per litre on kerosene and Rs 120 per cylinder on cooking gas. 

 Modani is of the view that if the price of the Indian basket of crude oil slips back to $55 per barrel, todays hike could put oil companies in a much better position.

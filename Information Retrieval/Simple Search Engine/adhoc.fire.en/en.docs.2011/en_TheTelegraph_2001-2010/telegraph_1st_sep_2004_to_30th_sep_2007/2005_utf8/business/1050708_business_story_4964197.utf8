 Detergent melts in P amp;G purge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 7: The board of Procter amp; Gamble Hygiene and Healthcare Ltd is considering the sale or transfer of its detergent business.

 The consumer goods company is trying to streamline its operations and stick to its core competence in hygiene and healthcare. The integration of Gillette with P amp;G in the coming months could also have inspired the move.

 The decision will be taken on July 11, when the P amp;G board meets, the company has informed the stock exchanges.

 P amp;G officials, however, declined to elaborate on the move.

 P amp;G Hygiene and Healthcares detergent business garners a revenue of Rs 200 crore annually. However, the company makes a bulk of its profit from selling products like Vicks Vaporub and Whisper sanitary napkins.

 The detergents manufacturing facility is in Mandideep in Madhya Pradesh. It is outsourced to its sister concern, P amp;G Home Products, which markets the premier detergent products ? Tide and Ariel. P amp;G, which launched Ariel in the nineties in India, had hived off the detergents marketing outfit into a separate company.

 However, at that time, it had retained the plant within the listed company with the products being manufactured by it and outsourced to the wholly-owned Indian subsidiary of the Cincinnati-based P amp;G. P amp;G Hygiene and Healthcare had posted a net profit of Rs 14.66 crore for the quarter ended March 31 against Rs 18.12 crore for the quarter ended March 31.

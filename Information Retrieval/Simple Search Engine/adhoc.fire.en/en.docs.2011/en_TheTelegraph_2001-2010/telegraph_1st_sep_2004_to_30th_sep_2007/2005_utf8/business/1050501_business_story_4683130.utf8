 Bid to hasten core projects

 S. P. S. PANNU

 New Delhi, April 30: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is reported to have cracked the whip on ministries handling the core sectors of the economy and set a 15-day deadline for the coal ministry to submit details of all new projects in its pipeline.

 Sources said the Prime Minister had expressed his disappointment over the poor performance of the core sectors at a meeting held to review their work recently.

 The overall performance of the core sector, comprising crude oil and petroleum products, coal, electricity and steel, has slowed to 4.4 per cent during the financial year ended March 31, 2005, from 6.2 per cent in 2003-04. 

 Singh has identified the coal sector as a major culprit as it has a cascading effect in dragging down both the power and steel sectors as well. The coal ministry has been asked to immediately draw up a fast-track action plan to fulfil the shortfall in coal production.

 The vital role of the coal sector has been singled out for special attention as there is an urgent need to reduce the country?s ever-increasing dependence on oil.

 With national oil majors ONGC and OIL failing to make any major oil find in recent years, the dependence on imports has shot past the 70 per cent mark.

 The oil import bill for 2004-05 was 41 per cent higher than 2003-04 as the average crude oil price for the year had shot up by over $10 per barrel to $37 per barrel. With international prices of the Indian crude import basket shooting up to $50 per barrel during the current fiscal, the import bill is expected to jump even higher.

 While there is frantic activity to tie up more natural gas imports as an alternative fuel, the price factor is emerging as a major hurdle. 

 Even Iran, a country that has been cornered by the US and is desperate to sell natural gas to India, is benchmarking the price to skyrocketing crude rates.

 Such a price is clearly not affordable by the NTPC-dominated Indian power sector which has to sell electricity at fixed prices.

 The power ministry has, in fact, pointed out that the price of natural gas cannot be linked to crude as, unlike petrol or diesel, it is not produced from crude oil.

 According to this view, the price of gas which is found in a natural state should be benchmarked with coal which is the alternative fuel for the power sector. 

 NTPC is also reported to have asked the government to reduce the 51 per cent equity that user industries have to pick up in captive mining projects to 26 per cent.

 A senior official told The Telegraph that the government is examining the proposal seriously in order to give a fillip to both the coal mining and power sectors.

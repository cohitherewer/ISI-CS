 No wealth to declare 

 The wealth tax net covers few assessees. 

 Chandralekha Tulal finds out why

 An income tax lawyer made an interesting 

 observation about the paradox that we call income tax: a 

 man has a palatial house in the heart of the city valued 

 at Rs 1 crore. He has another house which he uses for business. 

 He has investment worth a few lakhs in shares, bonds and 

 mutual funds. He also has a farmhouse more than 25 kilometres 

 away from the local municipal units. Is he a wealthy man? 

 Of course, he is and should be liable to pay wealth tax. 

 But he is not.

 Growing disparities in income 

 and wealth have ignited discussions on the need to introduce 

 wealth tax in several developed countries.

 In India, the government was enterprising 

 enough to introduce and maintain wealth tax rules even when 

 such disparities were not immediately visible. Till date 

 also, income tax practitioners mention that there are very 

 limited assessees who are charged wealth tax. Moreover, 

 the wealth tax rules leave a lot of ?wealthy? people out 

 of the net.

 Under the income tax rules, every 

 individual, Hindu undivided family (HUF) and companies with 

 net wealth in excess of Rs 15 lakh are required to file 

 wealth tax returns.

 One has to prepare a statement 

 of net wealth, mentioning all the assets and liabilities 

 valued as on the valuation date and according to the valuation 

 rules. The valuation date is the last day of the previous 

 year, generally March 31 of every year.

 ?Net wealth? is the aggregate 

 of the value of all the assets belonging (or deemed assets) 

 to you, as on the valuation date and reduced by the aggregate 

 value of the debts/liabilities owed on the valuation date.

 ?Deemed assets? are those held 

 by spouse, minor child and similar other person where the 

 assets have been transferred without adequate consideration 

 and thereby included in net wealth. In such a case, ?clubbing 

 of income? applies and all such assets would also be included 

 within the definition of ?net wealth?.

 However, assets, including shares, 

 securities, debentures, bonds, bank and other deposits, 

 are not subject to wealth tax. Thereafter, you can reduce 

 the amount by all the debts owed by you that have been incurred 

 in relation to assets chargeable to tax.

 Finally, you compute the wealth 

 tax at the flat rate of 1 per cent on net wealth exceeding 

 Rs 15 lakh. However, if you are a person of Indian origin 

 and want to come back to India as a permanent resident, 

 assets brought by you and acquired within a year immediately 

 preceding the date of return and anytime thereafter is exempt 

 for a period of seven successive assessment years.

 Moreover, in the case of an NRI, 

 the value of assets located outside the country will not 

 be included in the chargeable net wealth.

 Dasgupta: Looking ahead

 Calcutta, Jan. 6: Oracle will focus on education and health, in addition to the existing key sectors, like the government, telecom and financial services.

 Shekhar Dasgupta, Oracle India managing director, said, ?The last six months saw a large uptake of Oracle mid-market offerings in India. We also entered new markets in the last six to eight months and consolidated our presence in polyester films, gems and jewellery, dairy, pulp and paper, metals, textiles, pharmaceuticals, retail and clinical trials management.?

 For the second quarter ended November 2004 (fiscal June to May), total revenues in the Asia-Pacific (A-Pac) region grew to $402 million, which is a 9 per cent increase over the corresponding period last year. The A-Pac region accounted for 18.5 per cent of Oracle?s new licence revenue worldwide and 14.5 per cent of the total global revenues.

 Earnings per share increased 35 per cent, net income grew 32 per cent and total revenues grew 10 per cent in the reporting quarter. Operating margins grew 41 per cent.

 The company refused to divulge India-specific financial details, but confirmed that the country was the fifth largest market for Oracle after Japan, South Korea, China and Australia.

 ?This was the first quarter when Oracle had dedicated teams in the A-Pac region for applications, technology and the key focus areas of financial services, telecom and the government,? Dasgupta said. ?The segmentation of sales, pre-sales, alliances, channels and marketing teams for applications, technology and industries has helped us compete more effectively and gain momentum in our focus areas.?

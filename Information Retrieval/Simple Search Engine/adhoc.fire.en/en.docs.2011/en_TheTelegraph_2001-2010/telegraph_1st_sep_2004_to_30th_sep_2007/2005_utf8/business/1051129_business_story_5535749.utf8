The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Tech dynamics on Infocom screen

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Gearing up

 Calcutta, Nov. 28: Information technology, everyday for everyone.

 If you are wondering how, titans of the industry will be here for five days from December 7 to prove that the theme for this year?s Infocom, the countrys biggest IT show, is no tall claim.

 The idea behind Infocom 2005, organised by Nasscom and Businessworld, an ABP group publication and Indias largest selling business magazine, is to hold up to the world the changing face of the industry in the country. The purpose: to integrate the seemingly disparate segments, such as software and hardware, on a common platform.

 ?Infocom is probably the largest IT-specific exhibition in India. It has grown in stature and recognition over the years. Right now, it is growing beyond India?s borders as well. The interest shown by the IT industry abroad has been phenomenal,? said Kiran Karnik, president of Nasscom, the representative of the software industry in the country.

 The annual meeting ground for the best minds in IT, business strategists and policymakers, the event will see some of the worlds topmost thought leaders, technocrats and innovators. For the first time, an industry-academia interface has been scheduled, where India?s premier management and statistical institutes like IIM Calcutta, XLRI and ISI will interact with IT professionals.

 ?A lot of industry research is spawned in academia and then incorporated in industry. Unfortunately, India is lagging behind in this regard. There is so much of untapped resources and talent in Indian academia. Therefore, we plan to have an agenda, where industry will organise a research project, and will evaluate its progress at a suitable platform next year,? said D.D. Purkayastha, director, ABP Pvt Ltd.

 The December 7-11 show will see an IT ministers? meet as well. IT ministers of 12 states have confirmed their participation. Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee will also attend the meet. ?The CM will be playing an active role in this year?s exposition as always,? said Bengal IT secretary G.D. Gautama.

 Infocom 2005 will also serve as a showpiece event for the state?s fast-growing IT industry. After Infocom 2004, where brand Bengal was sold aggressively to the IT industry, Gautama is optimistic about this year?s event. ?Previously, there was a huge perception issue about Bengal. Infocom has played a large role in changing that. Second, Infocom provides us with a great opportunity to network and meet industry leaders every year,? he said.

 The event will be held on the Salt Lake stadium grounds, while the conferences and business meets will be at Hyatt Regency. With almost 1,500 delegates from all over the world scheduled to participate, the number of footfalls at the exhibition is expected to cross 1,50,000.

 But its not going to be all work and no play. The Infocom CXO golf tournament on December 7 will see some of the countrys top CEOs and CIOs try to live up to their handicaps on the Royal Calcutta Golf Club greens.

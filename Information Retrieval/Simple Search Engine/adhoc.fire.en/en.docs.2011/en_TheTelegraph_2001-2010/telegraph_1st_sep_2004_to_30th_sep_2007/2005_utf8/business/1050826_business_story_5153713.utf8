 VW keeps drivers seat warm for Bernhard

 Wolfgang Bernhard: Cut out for the challenge

 Frankfurt, Aug. 24 (Reuters): Volkswagen is grooming star manager Wolfgang Bernhard to become chief executive of Europes biggest carmaker, its supervisory board chairman said in an interview published on Wednesday.

 VW last year hired Bernhard after rival DaimlerChrysler abruptly cut loose the German manager who helped to restore profits at its US arm, Chrysler.

 Bernhard, known for cost-cutting, now heads the core Volkswagen brand group.

 Bernhard has scotched speculation that he might jump back to Daimler to work under former Chrysler boss Dieter Zetsche, who will replace Juergen Schrempp as group chief executive at the start of 2006.

 Asked by German weekly magazine Stern what Volkswagen had offered Bernhard to keep him, chairman Ferdinand Piech said: That is very simple. Bernhard reckoned that (VW chief executive) Pischetsrieder is five years older than Zetsche. If he does good work, he knows where it will be his turn earlier.

 Piech and CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder also said an investigation into suspected fraud and breach of trust at VW had not turned up any new names of potential suspects.

 Piech said a network of front companies that former managers allegedly set up to do business with VW was bigger and more complex than first thought. Pischetsrieder said the number of people involved from outside VW was also larger than expected.

 VW brought in outside auditors to check the case.

 There will not be an interim report before the supervisory board meeting in September and the final report will certainly not come before the end of October, the CEO said.

 Piech and Pischetsrieder said they hoped that German elections due on September 18 would rid them and the German auto industry of Juergen Trittin of the Greens, environment minister Chancellor Gerhard Schroeders coalition.

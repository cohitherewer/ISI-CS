 AstraZeneca takes Ranbaxy to court

 Taking a shot

 New Delhi, Nov. 22: AstraZeneca has filed a lawsuit against Ranbaxy Laboratories to prevent it from launching a generic version of the British firm?s patented anti-ulcer drug, Nexium.

 Ranbaxy has filed an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) with the US Food and Drug Administration to market a generic version of Nexium in the US before the patents expire.

 The lawsuit, filed in the US district court of New Jersey, automatically bars the US Food and Drug Administration from approving Ranbaxys application for 30 months, or until the final court decision.

 ?AstraZeneca has full confidence in and will continue vigorously to defend and enforce its intellectual property rights protecting Nexium,? the Anglo-Swedish firm said in a statement.

 A Ranbaxy spokesperson said the company would defend the case in the US court.

 AstraZeneca has six patents on different versions of the drug, which will expire between 2014 and 2019.

 Nexium is the British pharmaceutical company?s top-selling drug, which raked in a revenue of around $3.8 billion last year. AstraZeneca is already fighting a challenge to the same drug from Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy?s Laboratories.

 The drug is prescribed for gastro-oesophageal reflux, also called heartburn or acid reflux. Ranbaxy wants to produce cheap forms of both the 20 mg and 40 mg Nexium capsules.

 The generic challenge to Nexium, though widely anticipated, is the latest setback for AstraZeneca after some of its biggest drug hopes flopped and Israel?s Teva Pharmaceuticals unveiled plans in September to launch a generic version of schizophrenia medicine Seroquel, another key growth driver.

 David Brennan, AstraZeneca?s new chief executive, said earlier this month he was looking to buy medicines in late-stage clinical trials to beef up the firm?s drugs pipeline.

 Code Securities analyst Paul Diggle said losing market exclusivity on Nexium would be a big blow, but noted that generic drugmakers took a while before eventually overcoming AstraZeneca?s defences on Prilosec, Nexium?s predecessor. 

 ?I don?t see why Nexium would be any easier,? he said. Diggle expects Nexium?s sales to peak at $5.5 billion in 2005.

 The high stakes involved have made litigation an integral part of the global generic drug business. According to analysts, Ranbaxy has spent about $20 million on litigation in patent challenges last year. They feel companies will not shy away from spending more because of the sheer size of the gains in case of a win.

 Generic drug refers to a copy of an original product whose patent has expired. Generics are also sometimes defined as a medicine for which the patent of the active substance has expired.

 Ranbaxy recently lost a key patent litigation against Pfizer over the latter?s best-selling anti-cholesterol drug, Lipitor. It has now filed for an appeal. A similar patent challenge case is pending in the US courts and a decision is expected towards the end of this year.

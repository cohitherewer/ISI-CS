The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 CSE revamp on course 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 30: Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE) has invited merchant bankers and consultants to prepare a roadmap for its demutualisation scheme.

 T.K. Das, CSE administrator, said, We have tried to make the process transparent by inviting bids from merchant bankers for devising the roadmap that includes valuation of the exchange and search for strategic partners.

 The merchant banker will have to prepare a roadmap for the exchanges business plans and for inducting strategic partners to revive the exchange as well as divesting 51 per cent shareholding to non-brokers.

 Das said the exchange has already initiated discussions with reputed merchant bankers for identifying strategic partners. However, we did not receive encouraging response, which prompted us to invite bids on a larger scale, he added. According to the demutualisation scheme, the exchange will have to complete the whole process by the end of August.

 The proposals have to be submitted by January 31, after which the tender selection committee will scrutinise the proposals and select the most suitable merchant banker within one month, said Das.

 Post selection, the consultant will get one month to prepare the roadmap and identify the possible strategic investors. Since they are experts, they would be the best people to do this and should be able to complete the whole process within the stipulated time-frame, he said. 

 CSE had entrusted Ernst amp; Young with the job for its proposed commodity exchange. They had also suggested that CSE could implement the project with other strategic partners, Das added. However, the member brokers of the exchange are not convinced with this step. No concrete step has yet been taken to revive the stock exchange or develop alternate business models for the same and this move would also yield nothing, said a member broker.

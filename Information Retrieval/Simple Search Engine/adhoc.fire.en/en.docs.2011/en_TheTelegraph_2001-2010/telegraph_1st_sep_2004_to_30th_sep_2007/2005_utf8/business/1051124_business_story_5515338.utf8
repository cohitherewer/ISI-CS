 Muthuraman: Big plans

 Mumbai, Nov. 23: Tata Steel is optimistic about the future of its 50:50 joint venture with BlueScope Steel of Australia that will provide solutions to the construction industry. 

 The venture, which will invest Rs 1,200 crore, is looking at a topline figure of Rs 1,000 crore over the next four years and Rs 2,000 crore at its full capacity. The two companies signed the agreement today.

 The joint venture will invest Rs 1,200 crore in four manufacturing locations in the country and set up a network of sales offices in the Saarc region. It will manufacture and supply flat steel products such as Zincalume and Colorbond-coated steels and a range of metal-building solutions.

 The manufacturing units will come up at Pune in Maharashtra, Bhiwadi in Rajasthan, Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu and Jamshedpur in Jharkhand. 

 The Jamshedpur facility will be adjacent to Tata Steel?s existing steelworks. It will have a metal coating capacity of 2.50 lakh tonnes and a paint line capacity of 1.50 lakh tonnes annually. Its capital cost is put at Rs 900 crore (Australian $265 million).

 The venture will bring about a major change in the construction industry in terms of providing steel-based design and products, Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman said after signing the agreement with Kirby Adams, CEO amp; managing director of BlueScope Steel.

 Muthuraman, who is in favour of a change in the composition of raw materials used in the construction industry, said the use of cement in India was three times more than that of steel in construction.

 ?Here the ratio is 3:1, whereas it is 1:1 in the developed world,? he said. Steel is earthquake resistant and has aesthetic value, he added.

 ?Tata Steel and BlueScope Steel share a similar approach to value creation in the steel business. Consumers will benefit from the range of solutions that will now be available to the building industry,? Muthuraman said.

 BSNL redials village phone number

 Growth pulse 

 New Delhi, April 10: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd has drawn up a special plan to provide the second village public telephone (VPT) in more than 2 lakh villages at a cost of Rs 1,200 crore during this financial year.

 The government-owned public sector company has also set a target to provide the first VPT in the remaining 62,000 villages by year-end. The special plan includes installation of high-capacity switches with higher upgradable options.

 Most of the switches that will be installed in rural areas for the second VPT will have the capability to migrate to the latest technology and will be on a par to get services simultaneously that are introduced in urban centres.

 Chairman and managing director A. K. Sinha said, ?We are all prepared to start the installation of the second VPT. We expect this phone to have more utility with the use of broadband applications.?

 More than 1.3 million applicants in the rural areas are waiting for a phone. This was highlighted by the parliamentary standing committee on information and telecommunications in its latest report. 

 The committee had expressed its disappointment at the growing waitlist and urged the communications minister to pull up senior officials of BSNL. 

 Communications minister Dayanidhi Maran has promised that all waitlisted applicants in rural areas will get telephones by year-end.

 The public sector telecom company was directed to enhance the capacity to meet this target.

 A senior BSNL board official said, ?We are doing our best to meet the target. Why is only BSNL being targeted for the waitlist and not other private operators? It is a strange co-incidence that we are accused of losing customers and yet we have a waitlist of applicants.?

 ?Not many have researched this paradox. The regulator should perhaps take up this issue and not just highlight the growth of mobile phones. It is true that so many applicants are waiting for a phone connection. Many of them are applicants for their first phone,? the official said.

 The current teledensity in the urban area is 25 per cent and 1.1 per cent in rural areas. There were 1.5 crore rural telephone connections till March 31.

 Sinha said the company has received orders for more than Rs 200 crore from the Universal Service Obligations Fund administration. 

 He also highlighted that most of the telecommunication facilities in rural areas are set up by BSNL.

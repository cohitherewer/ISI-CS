 Seniors lose out in tax tweak

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 8: Chartered accountants feel senior citizens could end up paying more taxes because of the withdrawal of the rebate under various sections of the Income Tax Act and the introduction of a new section that offers an across-the-board deduction of up to Rs 1 lakh invested in a range of instruments.

 At a meeting with senior officials of the central board of direct taxes, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) also noted that the abolition of standard deduction might be viewed as a discrimination against salaried taxpayers.

 Senior citizens have been hard hit, as they currently dont have to pay any tax up to Rs 20,000 on interest income. But 80 L ? the section that allowed this ? has now been scrapped.

 So while allowing an across-the-board tax relief, the budget has done away any special relief for senior citizens who may have invested in fixed deposits. Pensioners who were earlier allowed standard deductions can no longer do so.

 On the contentious issue of fringe benefit tax, ICAI says, ?No benefit, whether in cash or in kind, which are in the nature of income to the employee should be left untaxed?. 

 During the course of the deliberations, the apex institute members have held that the principle of equity should however be incorporated in the legislation. 

 ?Small employers might find it extremely difficult,? the deliberations have noted. ?However, the mode of computation of the various fringe benefits should be rationalised,? ICAI said.

 But the institute said payments which could be clearly attributed to employees should be taxed directly in their hands.

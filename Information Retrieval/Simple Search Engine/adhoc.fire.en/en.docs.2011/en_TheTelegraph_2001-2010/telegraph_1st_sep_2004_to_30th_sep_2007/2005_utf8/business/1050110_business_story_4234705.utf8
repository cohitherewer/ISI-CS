 Small comfort for Big Three

 Detroit, Jan. 9 (Reuters): After another brutal year, Detroit?s automakers will put on a brave face as they play host to arch-rivals led by Toyota Motor Corp at the North American International Auto Show opened on Sunday. 

 But many analysts say Detroit?s Big Three are also getting ready to roll out some disappointing 2005 earnings outlooks, in a sign of more tough times to come in the new year. 

 The auto show, in a downtown convention centre brimming with sheet metal, is all about product. And executives from General Motors, Ford Motor and the Chrysler side of DaimlerChrysler AG will use it to highlight the new or substantially redesigned vehicles they hope to support their market share going forward. 

 New models from the Big Three are unlikely to generate as much excitement as in previous years, however. To some, barring major surprises, it may even seem like the Motor City is running on empty. 

 The show kic ks off another year of cut-throat competition in the auto industry. Dark storm clouds on the horizon for Detroit include high retiree and health care costs, shrinking market share and a meagre profit outlook. Some industry insiders insist these are sapping confidence in the Big Three as perhaps never before. 

 There are even fears that credit rating agency Standard amp; Poor?s, which rates both GM and Ford one notch above speculative grade, could change its stable outlook on one or both of them to negative this year. That would set the stage for a cut to junk status for the companies, which have a combined $450 billion of debt outstanding. 

 A cut in the debt rating to junk would make it much harder for GM or Ford to bolster sales by providing car buyers with cheap loans. Ratings fears were highlighted in a recent survey of global investors by BNP Paribas. 

 Chrysler was the lone bright spot in Detroit last year, picking up a sliver of US market share after the successful launch of the Chrysler 300, its brassy new flagship sedan. 

 GM and Ford both lost share to foreign rivals, however. With aggressive Asian and European carmakers ramping up output amid a flat US sales outlook, more share erosion seems inevitable. 

 ?I think the Big Three are probably going to lose a little more market share in 2005 versus where they were in 2004,? said David Healy, an auto analyst with Burnham Securities.

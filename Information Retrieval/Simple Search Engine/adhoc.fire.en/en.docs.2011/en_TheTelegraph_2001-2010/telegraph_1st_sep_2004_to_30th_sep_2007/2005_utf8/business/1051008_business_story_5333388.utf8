 Foreign bonds to fund Leela expansion

 New Delhi, Oct. 7: Leela Palaces and Resorts plans to raise between Rs 250 and Rs 300 crore to fund its expansion that includes new hotel projects in Pune and Hyderabad.

 The hotel chain is contemplating to raise the capital required in March 2007 through a second issue of foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs).

 Our calculation is that after March 2007 we will need to raise another Rs 250 to 300 crore. For this purpose, we will either garner money through FCCBs or go in for long-term debt, Vivek Nair, vice-chairman of the Leela Group, told The Telegraph.

 The most likely instrument will be FCCBs. Most companies have been using this route to raise capital this year. We are confident about the performance of our hotels. Later, the bonds will be converted into equity shares. This will be more advantageous for us, Nair said.

 The group had concluded its first FCCB issue only last week raising Rs 300 crore. The company intends to dig into its internal accruals to fund projects that are likely to be completed before early 2007.

 Nair said the group has enough funds for now. Back in February, it had raised Rs 200 crore through a private placement of equity with four private investors.

 At present, Leela Palaces and Resorts has four operating hotels in Mumbai, Bangalore, Goa and Kovalam. 

 The group plans to complete its hotel in Udaipur by the end of 2006.

 The Leela hotel in Chennai is scheduled to open in the winter of 2008, while the properties in Pune and Hyderabad are expected to begin operations only by mid-2009.

 The Leela group has invested Rs 800 crore in its operating hotels and hopes to invest another Rs 900 crore in its new properties, said Nair.

 On Tuesday, the board of directors cleared plans for a hotel in Pune which, Nair said, will carry a classic residential look.

 To be built at a cost of Rs 120 crore (including the Rs 30-crore spent on the land), the seven- to eight-storey hotel will have 200 guestrooms and suites. It will also have a spa, a fitness centre, a cafe and two speciality restaurants. 

 The company is yet to pick the designers for the hotel.

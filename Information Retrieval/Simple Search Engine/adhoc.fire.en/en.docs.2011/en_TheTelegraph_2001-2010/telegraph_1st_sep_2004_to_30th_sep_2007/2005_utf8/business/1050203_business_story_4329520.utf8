 Calcutta, Feb. 2: Bata India Limited has reconstituted its board and brought in Marcello Villagran Bravo as the new managing director. He is currently running Bata Chile.

 Bravo, who has spent thirty-four years in Bata, will replace Steve Davies ? the managing director of Bata India for the last two-and-a-half years. Davies, who is probably the longest serving expatriate managing director, is expected to join a senior position in the parent company ? Bata Shoe Organisation.

 Bata India has also inducted Amit Mitra, secretary-general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), and N. Sankar, chairman of the Sanmar group on its board. 

 Bata has also brought in Saibal Sinha as the finance director. Sinha?s last assignment was with Reckitt Benckiser in the UK and India.

 Analysts feel that frequent changes in the top-level management has affected the working of the company and hit its bottomline.

 The Bata India board had called an extra-ordinary general meeting today to get shareholders? nod for the proposed rights issue and increase the authorised share capital of the company. The shareholders have okayed both the proposals.

 Bata India chairman P. M. Sinha said, ?Our share prices have touched a peak of Rs 91. It ruled over Rs 90 for more than four weeks and is still trading around Rs 85, even with a decline in the sensex. Our rights issue at a price band of Rs 45-54 is at a discount of 35-40 per cent.? The company will issue shares at the ratio of 4:1.

 The company will use the funds to modernise its stores and manufacturing facilities, develop new designs, purchase raw materials and retire high-cost debts.

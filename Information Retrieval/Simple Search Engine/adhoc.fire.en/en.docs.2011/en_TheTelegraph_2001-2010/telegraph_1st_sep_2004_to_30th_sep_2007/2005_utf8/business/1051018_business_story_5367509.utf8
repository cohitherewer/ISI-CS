 Mauritius FII out of Duncans 

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Oct. 17: Angsana (Mauritius) Investment Limited, the lone foreign institutional investor (FII) in the G.P. Goenka-controlled Duncans Industries, has divested its stake in the company.

 The FII, which is a subsidiary of Temasek Holdings (Pte) Limited, had a 9.39 per cent stake. Temasek Holdings is the investment arm of the Singapore government.

 In October 1996, Duncans had allotted 50 lakh shares of Rs 10 each at a premium of Rs 54.08 each to Angsana (Mauritius) Investment.

 Brokers feel the FIIs decision has been prompted by the reopening of Duncans fertiliser unit. There was an upswing in the stocks of the company after the unit was reopened.

 The company has a debt burden of Rs 900 crore. According to the corporate debt restructuring package worked out by banks and okayed by all stakeholders, the loan will be repaid over 12 years. The FII must have thought that this was the right time to divest rather than wait for a few more years, an analyst said. Goenka is also keen to reduce the promoters holding in the company, sources said. 

 The promoters hold a 58.87 per cent stake, which has to be brought down to 55 per cent under guidelines framed by Sebi.

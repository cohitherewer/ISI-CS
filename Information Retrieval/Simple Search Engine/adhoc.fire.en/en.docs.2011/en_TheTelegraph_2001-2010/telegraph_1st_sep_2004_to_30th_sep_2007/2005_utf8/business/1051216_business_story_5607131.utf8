 Inflation to stay benign

 Calcutta, Dec. 15: The Reserve Bank of India expects the annual rate of inflation to be around 5-5.5 per cent by March 2006, even though it is keeping a watch on global oil prices.

 The central board of the RBI today met in Calcutta to take stock of the economy. RBI deputy governor Rakesh Mohan said, ?We discussed the current state of the economy. The meeting reviewed key economic, monetary and financial developments. The developments since the last board meeting in October have been normal.? 

 He, however, added: ?We are watching oil prices all the time.? RBI governor Y.V. Reddy could not attend the meeting as he was indisposed and the meeting was chaired by Rakesh Mohan. The other three deputy governors ? V. Leeladhar, Shyamala Gopinath and Usha Thorat ? were present at the meeting.

 While global oil prices have risen 38 per cent this year, India, which imports two-thirds of its oil requirements, has raised domestic fuel prices by about 14 per cent. 

 Last week, the government said in a quarterly economic review in Parliament that domestic inflation had been contained at moderate levels and it would be possible to rein in the rate of annual average inflation to below 5.0-5.5 per cent in 2005-06.

 Regional rural banks

 Thorat today met the chiefs of regional rural banks to review their performance and suggest ways to improve it. 

 High oil prices had pushed inflation to over 8 per cent in August 2004, prompting the central bank to raise interest rates in October last year, the first time in four years. 

 The bank raised the key short-term rate in April and October this year, each by a quarter point to 5.25 per cent to ward off inflation pressures.

 India?s wholesale price index rose 4.54 per cent on an annual basis in the week ended November 26, up from the previous week?s 4.32 per cent, due to higher food and manufactured product prices. 

 Regional rural banks

 Thorat today met the chiefs of regional rural banks to review their performance and suggest ways to improve it. 

 The meeting gains significance at a time when the RBI has strongly favoured a comprehensive overhauling of the regional rural banks (RRBs), which act as critical instruments for rural credit.

 Recently, Reddy also indicated an early restructuring and recapitalisation of RRBs.

 Three RRBs are performing extremely well and they may be given the task of handling current chests and foreign exchange, Reddy said in his address at Bancon 2005 held last month in Calcutta. He was also in favour of allowing them to install ATMs.

 RBI feels that while immediate measures have been undertaken to increase the flow of credit to agriculture, there is still a need to review the policy of rural credit in a comprehensive and thorough manner.

 The central bank feels that there is a need for legal and institutional changes relating to governance, regulation and functioning of RRBs.

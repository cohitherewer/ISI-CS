 Piped gas grid to expand

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Steady supply 

 Calcutta, March 6: Gail (India) Ltd is planning to boost city-gas distribution projects across the country.

 The gas marketing major, which has ushered in radical changes in Delhi and Mumbai by introducing piped natural gas (PNG) as an environment friendly cleaner alternative to liquid fuel and coal for automobile, industrial and household sectors, is hoping to replicate the experience in other parts of the country.

 Gail has identified 10 cities, mostly located in the north and the west, to set up the gas distribution network. The cities include Agra, Lucknow, Faridabad, Bareilly, Kanpur, Pune, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Vijaywada and Noida.

 ?Gail has acquired the expertise in building city gas distribution networks that has been manifested by the success of Delhi and Mumbai. Now we want to leverage on that competence and replicate the model in other cities,? Proshanto Banerjee, Gail chairman and managing director told The Telegraph.

 Like in Mumbai and Delhi, it will enter into joint venture with other public sectors oil companies for the project. 

 Gail and British Gas have formed a joint venture for Mahanagar Gas Ltd in Mumbai. In Delhi, it has a three-way JV with Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) and the government of Delhi. It has also formed a JV with Hindustan Petroleum, called Bhagyanagar Gas Ltd (BGL), for cities in Andhra Pradesh.

 For Agra and Lucknow, Gail plans to form a common joint venture corporate entity. It has initiated talks with Indian Oil Corporation for these two cities. For Kanpur, Gail and BPCL will have a joint venture called Central UP Gas Limited. As for the neighbouring cities like Faridabad and Noida, Indraprastha Gas has been assigned the work 

 In Pune city, a joint venture will be formed with BPCL, while in Vijaywada, Gail and HPCL are working together under BGL. Similarly, for Navi Mumbai and Thane, Mahanagar Gas Ltd has been assigned the work.

 In Bareilly, the project talk has been initiated but no company has been firmed up for the joint venture operation and discussion is still on.

 Gail?s investment in these projects will not be significant as JV companies will raise money through their balance sheet to fund the capital expenditure. Typically, Gail?s capex plan involves setting up the nationwide gas grid whereby natural gas is brought to the outskirts of cities and industrial towns.

 The JV companies then take up the task of providing the last mile connectivity to customers.

 Gail?s investment on city gas distribution will be in equity portion and for cities like Agra, Lucknow, Kanpur, Pune, and Bareilly, it will be Rs 23 crore.

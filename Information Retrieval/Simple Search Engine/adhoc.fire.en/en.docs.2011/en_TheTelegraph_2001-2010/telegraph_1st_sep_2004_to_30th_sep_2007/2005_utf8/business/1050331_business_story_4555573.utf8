The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Still some shine left in jute

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Good times 

 Calcutta, March 30: The national jute policy, approved by the cabinet committee of economic affairs, has assured the use of the natural fibre for foodgrain packaging in the next five years.

 It has also proposed to create a brand equity fund exclusively for jute to promote international marketing of the natural fibre-based products.

 It has also been decided to revitalise the ailing public sector undertakings engaged in jute-related business and services.

 Although the policy paper mentioned about reintroduction of mandatory packaging of food grains in jute sacks to provide marketing support to the industry, Indian Jute Mills Association sources said they had been informally told that the scheme would be valid for the next five years.

 It was also decided that a National Jute Board will be set up to ensure improved co-ordination among several organisations under different ministries and departments of various state governments.

 According to a copy of the policy paper available with The Telegraph, the city-based office of the jute commissioners will be transformed to function as a facilitator of development of the jute sector from its current role as a regulator.

 In due course, the office of the jute commissioner will be merged with the proposed National Jute Board.

 The board will incorporate an export promotion council and play the role of a facilitator, deal with disputes under various agreements of the WTO and establish warehousing facilities in major importing countries.

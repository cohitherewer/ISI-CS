 No-frills bank account for common man

 Mumbai, Oct. 25: The Reserve Bank (RBI) today directed banks to offer a no-frills account that will hopefully bring within the banking system a large swathe of the population, who have lived outside its pale.

 The no-frills account will offer the benefit of a nil or very low minimum balance as well as low charges for a variety of banking facilities.

 The RBIs move is in sync with the UPA governments theme of financial inclusiveness that underpins the broad objectives outlined in its common minimum programme.

 Aam aadmi or the common mans interest was the common refrain during the general elections and thereafter in Union finance minister P. Chidambarams budget for 2004-05.

 Reserve Bank governor Y.V. Reddy became an unlikely advocate today when the mid-term review of the monetary policy alluded to financial inclusion of vast sections of population.

 We (the banks) are not fulfilling the mandate given for the banking system, Reddy rued while dwelling on financial inclusiveness.

 The RBI review said: While recognising the concerns in regard to the banking practices that tend to exclude rather than attract vast sections of population, the banks are urged to review their existing practices to align them with the objective of financial inclusion.

 During the 2004 general elections, the Congress party focused on aam aadmi, which badly undermined the India Shining campaign unveiled by the NDA government.

 Dena Bank CMD M.V. Nair admitted that a vast section of the population in urban and rural areas did not maintain bank accounts. Not even a savings account, he told The Telegraph.

 The RBI said many banks stipulated a minimum balance and a pyramid of charges on banking facilities that appeared to deter a sizeable section of population from opening and maintaining accounts.

 Well have to work on what benefits are to be given to a customer through the no-frills account, said Nair.

 The issues that have to be considered include the number of transactions that can be done through this account.

 We have to see what modalities should be used, whether it should be ATM-based or credit-based. The bank will have to work out the cost structure while creating such an account, Nair added.

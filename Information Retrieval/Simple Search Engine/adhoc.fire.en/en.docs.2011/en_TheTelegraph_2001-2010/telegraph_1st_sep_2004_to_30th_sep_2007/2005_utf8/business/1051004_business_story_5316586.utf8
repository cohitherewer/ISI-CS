 Reliance hikes prices 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 3: In tandem with the firm crude oil prices, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has raised the prices for most of its petrochemical products. 

 Barring partial oriented yarn (POY), the Mukesh Ambani group flagship has increased the prices in the range between 3.4 per cent and 6.8 per cent. The company has brought down the price of POY to Rs 70.70 per kg from Rs 73.20 per kg.

 This decline in POY prices should also be seen in the context of cotton prices that have come down by almost 25 per cent since mid-2004 to levels near historic lows.

 While polyester competes against cotton, the synthetic segment has been facing challenging times. A recent report by Fitch Ratings said that the demand for polyester has been growing at 4 per cent annually since 2000 ? much slower than the additional capacity being created every year. 

 Even as RIL cut POY prices to stay afloat in the highly competitive market for the product, it raised the polyester staple fibre price up to Rs 67.55 per kg against Rs 65.30.

 In other petrochemical products, too, where RIL has a dominance, the impact of firm crude prices could be clearly seen.

 RIL buys 1.36 cr shares of Reliance Energy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 4: Reliance Industries has acquired over 1.36 crore shares of Reliance Energy from Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary.

 Reliance Industries (RIL) today informed bourses that these shares were bought on June 30 and the acquisition amounted to inter-se transfer of shares under the promoter category.

 Sources said the purchase is being done to facilitate the demerger of RILs holdings in companies which are now under the control of Anil Ambani. 

 As part of the settlement between the Ambani brothers, Anil will control Reliance Energy, Reliance Infocomm and Reliance Capital.

 Reports suggest RIL will demerge its holdings into three companies which will be later merged with the operating companies.

 Meanwhile, Anil continued with the appointment of senior executives to his group companies. K.K. Sinha has joined Reliance Energy as director, human resources. He will be in charge of overall HR development across the organisation.

 Sinha, who was earlier director (HR) at NTPC, is a pioneer in the field of human resource development in the country and has various ground-breaking HR initiatives and processes to his credit.

 Sinha brings with him a wealth of experience and knowledge in the field of human resource development. I am confident that he will play a leading role in our drive to emerge as an employer of first choice and equal opportunity, Anil said. 

 Last week, Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprises (ADAE) had appointed Gautam Doshi, a leading chartered accountant, as group president.

 While Doshi will be a key member of the leadership team, he will be responsible for mergers and acquisitions in addition to supervising tax, regulatory and accounting functions. Doshi was earlier senior partner at RSM amp; Co and director of Ambani Corporate Finance.

 He is known for his expertise in matters relating to accounting, taxation and regulatory laws such as Companys Act, corporate governance code and Fema. 

 It is expected that ADAE will announce several senior level appointments in its group companies, including Reliance Infocomm, over the next few days.

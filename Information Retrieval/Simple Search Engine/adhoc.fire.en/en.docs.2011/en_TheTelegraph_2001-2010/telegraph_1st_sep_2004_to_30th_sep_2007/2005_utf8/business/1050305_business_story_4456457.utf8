 Meeting with RBI board today

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 4: Finance minister P. Chidambaram will meet the RBI board tomorrow to discuss monetary policy implications of the budget and finalise the borrowing schedule by the end of the month.

 ?Borrowings are likely to be lower than the budgeted amount in the next fiscal,? Chidambaram said, referring to expenditure control measures and buoyancy in tax collections.

 The finance minister also said a special purpose vehicle would be established in the next four to six weeks to raise Rs 10,000 crore to fund infrastructure projects. The borrowing limit for the SPV would be fixed at the start of each fiscal. In 2005-06, the borrowing limit for the SPV would be Rs 10,000 crore.

 He said the SPV would fund both private and public sector projects, which would be appraised by an inter-institutional group of banks and financial institutions.

 Ministry officials will meet RBI officials in the third week of March to draw up the schedule for the government?s market borrowing and market stabilisation scheme for the first half of 2005-06.

 ITC profit at Rs 572 cr

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 28: ITC Ltd has posted a 17.3 per cent growth in post-tax profit at Rs 572.33 crore for the quarter ended September 30 compared with Rs 488.07 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

 Its net turnover grew by 22.2 per cent at Rs 2,183 crore compared with Rs 1,786.09 crore in the corresponding period last year.

 The earnings per share (after the share split and issue of bonus shares) for the quarter was Rs 1.52.

 In the context of the base effect (tax refund higher by Rs 21 crore in the same quarter last year), the growth in post-tax profit is even more commendable.

 The robust sales growth of ITC was driven by higher cigarette sales, ramp up of the foods business, higher agri exports and improved performance of hotels, paperboards, paper and packaging segments.

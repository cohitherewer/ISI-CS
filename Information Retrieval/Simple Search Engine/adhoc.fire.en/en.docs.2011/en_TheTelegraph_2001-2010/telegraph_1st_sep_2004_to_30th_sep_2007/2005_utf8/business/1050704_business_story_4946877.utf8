 Air-India to hire Jet aircraft 

 SATISH JOHN

 Help at hand 

 Mumbai, July 3: Air-India is planning to take aircraft on wet lease from rival Jet Airways to tide over the temporary shortage in supply.

 Wet lease means the aircraft will sport the existing colours of the owner, and have on board the crew of the original owner, in this case the Jet Airways.

 ?We are considering the (Jet Airways) offer, and will take a decision next week,? said V. Thulasidas, chairman and managing director of Air-India. ?Our need is for a short period.?

 Jet Airways has proposed that for a short span of 20 days to a month, it can offer an aircraft to Air-India on wet lease. ?It is a win-win proposition,? said a senior official of the private airliner. 

 Air-India is facing a temporary shortage of aircraft as a Jumbo ? Boeing 747 ? is slotted for maintenance and repairs. Also, there is an unexpected delay in getting some aircraft on dry lease, Thulasidas said.

 The nation?s flag carrier is facing the shortage because it is adding new destinations aggressively to expand its global reach. 

 And then there are frequent requisitions for aircraft from the President and the Prime Minister who fly only by chartered Air-India flights.

 Jet Airways has recently taken three airbus A340-300 on dry lease from South African Airways. 

 The refurbished aircraft, sporting the colours of Jet Airways, will fly to the US and the UK. The airliner, however, is yet to get approval to fly to the US via Brussels. Its plans to start flights on the Mumbai-Brussels-Newark route has hit the air-pocket following a determined bid by a rival American namesake, Jet Airways Inc., to block the flights. It was scheduled to start the flight from June 23.

 The American airliner has requested the US department of transport not to allow the airliner to fly into the US skies, citing security risks. It has filed a complaint with US authorities charging the Indian Jet Airways with alleged Al Qaeda and Dawood links.

 Jet Airways has strongly denied the charges. It said the primary motive of the complaint is the trade name and the US Patent and Trademark office is looking into the matter.

 The Indian airliner has appointed prominent law firm Paul Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton amp; Garrison to initiate legal proceedings on its behalf. 

 Sources, however, say that Jet Airways is yet to take a legal recourse as it apprehends delay due to court proceedings, which could stretch from months to years. 

 For Jet Airways, any delay will cost it dear. Hence, it intends to wet lease at least one aircraft to Air-India that will give it some positive publicity as well as generate revenues.

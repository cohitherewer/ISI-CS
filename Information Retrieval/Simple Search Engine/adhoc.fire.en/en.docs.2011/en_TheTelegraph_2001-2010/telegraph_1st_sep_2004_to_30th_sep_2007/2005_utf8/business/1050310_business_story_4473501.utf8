 Calcutta, March 9: GE Healthcare Technologies today launched a high definition magnetic resonance (HDMR) device to boost income of the Indian outfit.

 The new device is expected to be the single largest revenue earner for the Indian unit of GE Healthcare and main procurement source for global marketing.

 A company official said the Indian unit?s exports could see a 10 per cent growth in the current year from around $250 million last year.

 The division of General Electric Corporation chose Calcutta for the national launch of the system, introduced in the US in December 2004, because of the market potential. ?Calcutta accounts for a substantial business for GE?s healthcare products,?? Giridhar Baliga, business manager, MR, said.

 According to V. Raja, president and chief executive officer, Southeast Asia, the new device, developed and manufactured at the company?s Bangalore unit, will provide physicians with unprecedented clarity in cases of parkinson?s disease, trauma, stroke, general restlessness, anxiety and paediatric patients who do not respond to sedation.

 The device, focussing on five critical areas of paediatrics, diabetes, breast cancer, liver and cardiac problems, is expected to make a real difference in patient diagnosis. 

 Mike Bourne, director of radiology of the University Hospital of Wales, said one in three cardiac patients could not hold breath long enough to make regular MR, one in 10 abdominal MR examinations were rendered inconclusive from motion artefacts or inadequate resolution, one in six paediatric patients did not respond adequately to sedation and one in three breast cancer patients had undiagnosed multi-facial disease. 

 ?With HDMR, these are problems of the past,? he said.

 The Indian outfit is expected to see a jump in income from the sale of the device, which is priced at around Rs 6 crore.

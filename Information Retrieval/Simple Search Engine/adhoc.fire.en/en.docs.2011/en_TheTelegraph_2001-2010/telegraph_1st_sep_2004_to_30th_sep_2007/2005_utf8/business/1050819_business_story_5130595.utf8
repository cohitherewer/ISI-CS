 Kochi refinery slips on swap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) today put off a decision on the merger of Bharat Petroleum Corporation with Kochi Refineries Limited (KRL) due to serious differences between the finance and petroleum ministries on the swap ratio. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram was tight-lipped on the issue after the meeting and said no decision had been taken yet. Some information has been sought and the issue will be considered again once the details are provided.

 Sources said the finance ministry feels the ratio recommended by the petroleum ministry will result in lowering the holding of the government in the merged entity. It is, therefore, pressing for a ratio that keeps the governments holding in the merged company unchanged.

 The petroleum ministry wants to transfer BPCL shares in KRL to a trust while the finance ministry is opposed to the move. The petroleum ministry wants to adopt this mode of transfer so that the trust can make funds available for the petroleum retailers capital investments.

 While Kochi Refineries is already a subsidiary of Bharat Petro, the petroleum ministry wants a merger to improve the balance sheet of the parent company. 

 BPCL has plunged into the red because it has to sell petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene below cost. Kochi Refineries, on the other hand, is enjoying high margins as it is allowed to sell its products to the marketing companies at international prices. The refineries in the country are making a gain of around $5 to $6 per barrel as prices of crude have soared past $66. 

 Marketing companies, however, buy these products at international prices and are forced by the government to sell them at a loss.

 Derivatives short sale

 New York, Sept. 22 (Reuters): India is planning to ease restrictions on derivatives trading, and is considering allowing investors to sell shares short.

 The moves come in response to investor requests, Sebi chairman M. Damodaran said at a conference in New York. 

 Within the next few weeks, the regulator is planning to increase the allowed size of derivatives positions, he said. This should make it easier for investors to hedge their positions.

 Meanwhile, an advisory committee is looking into the possibility of allowing investors to sell shares short, or bet that shares will fall by borrowing them, selling them, and potentially buying them back later at a lower price.

 New Delhi, March 11: While China has moved up in rank on the United Nations Industrial Development Organisations (Unido) competitive industrial performance index, India has slid down the charts. 

 Unido director general Carlos Magarinos said here today that China has improved its position in the index for 93 countries from the 39th rank in 1980 to the 24th spot in 2000. 

 India was ranked 39th in 1980; it went up a few notches to the 36th spot in 1990 only to slip to the 40th position in 2000. 

 Magarinos said among Asian countries, Singapore, South Korea and Malaysia figure in the first 20 with even Thailand occupying the 23rd position in 2000. ?All this shows huge growth potential yet to be tapped by the Indian manufacturing sector,? he added. 

 Sounding a note of caution, the Unido chief said while India can justly be proud of its global achievements in software, it would be a mistake to believe the country can achieve a high growth rate of 8 per cent per annum or above in the coming decades only on the performance of its services sector. 

 To achieve higher growth, India needs a strong manufacturing base, he emphasised.

 He said the share of manufacturing in Indias economy is quite low; just 16 per cent compared with 35 per cent in China, 30 per cent in South Korea, 31 per cent in Malaysia and 22 per cent in the Philippines. ?Of course, the focus will have to be on selected industrial sectors where the country has a competitive edge,? he added.

 He also highlighted the fact that China was ahead of India both in terms of the volume of international trade and FDI.

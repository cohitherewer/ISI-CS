 Fed fires eighth round at prices

 NICHOLAS RICCARDI

 Greenspan: Slow and steady

 Los Angeles, May 4: The Federal Reserve on Tuesday continued its slow-motion campaign against inflation, hiking its benchmark short-term interest rate by another quarter-point and signaling it would not ease its effort to rein in rising prices even as it acknowledged that the economy was slowing. 

 As expected, the central bank raised the federal funds rate to 3 per cent. It was the bank?s eighth hike since June, but it still leaves the rate near zero when matched up against the ever-climbing pace of inflation, which has risen to 3.1 per cent over the past year. 

 The increase in the funds rate ? what banks charge each other on overnight loans ? led major banks to raise their prime lending rates to 6 per cent from 5.75 per cent. The prime, a benchmark for many business and consumer loan rates, now is the highest since September 2001. 

 Mortgage rates, influenced by longer-term bond yields, have showed little sign of rising. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.78 per cent. While the Fed has tripled its federal funds rate since June, mortgage rates have dropped nearly 0.5 percentage points since then, a divergence that Fed chairman Alan Greenspan has termed a ?conundrum?. Some analysts, however, suggest that low long-term bond yields reflect investors? belief that a slowing economy is more of a threat than rising inflation. 

 In its statement accompanying Tuesday?s decision, the Fed retained its language that it would continue to hike rates at a ?measured? pace, but also noted that ?pressures on inflation? continued to rise. The Fed also acknowledged the economic slowdown in the first quarter of this year, an indication to investors that future rate hikes would continue to be modest. 

 The market zigzagged following the news, finally rallying in the final minutes after the Fed disclosed it had left out from its statement a sentence that said: ?Longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.? That helped quickly lift the Dow Jones industrial average from a loss of about 44 points to end the session up 5.25 points at 10,256.95. Treasury bond yields fell on the news of the revised statement. 

 As usual following a Fed announcement, analysts carefully scrutinised every sentence. Veteran Fed-watcher David Jones said this was the first time in his memory that the central bank had gone back and edited its statement. The addition of its reassurance on inflation, Jones said, shows that the Fed is concerned about the slowdown. 

 ?The fact that they went through all this trouble to release it says to me that Greenspan does not want to put as much emphasis on inflation as some in the market would,? said Jones, CEO of DMJ Advisors in Denver. ?The new surprise to the Fed is the unexpected softness in the economy in the first quarter, and while the Fed hopes that will be reversed with a rebound later, that?s the one thing they?re unsure of.? 

 Others focused on the central bank dropping its previously issued reassurance that high energy prices were not leaking into core inflation. They said the new communique showed the Fed?s priority would to keep inflation in check. ?It?s blindingly obvious that inflation is at the top of the agenda,? said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist for High Frequency Economics.

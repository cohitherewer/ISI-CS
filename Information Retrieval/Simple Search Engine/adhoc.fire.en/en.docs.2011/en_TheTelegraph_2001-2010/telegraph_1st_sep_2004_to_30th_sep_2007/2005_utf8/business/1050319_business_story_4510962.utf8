 Crude cools down

 London, March 18 (Reuters): World oil prices were a dollar off record highs on Friday after dealers took profits from the recent bull run, but analysts said fears of a supply crunch later this year would keep speculative investors in the market.

 Prices in New York and London raced to all-time highs this week as traders shrugged off Opec pledges for extra supply and doubted whether inventory levels and flagging crude output were enough to satisfy the world?s seemingly unquenchable oil thirst.

 US light crude was up two cents to $56.42 a barrel, just a dollar under the all-time peak of $57.60 hit on Thursday. London Brent was five cents a barrel down to $55.01 after hitting $56.15 in the previous session.

 ?The strength of global oil demand and US gasoline demand remains a strong source of support for speculative length and we believe $60 oil is a strong near-term likelihood,? Refco brokerage wrote in a report.

 ?The market remains obsessed with the idea that global demand growth will remain at a healthy clip this year, enough to make the comparatively slower rate of supply growth inadequate.?

 Haldia Petro board skirts irritants

 Calcutta, Dec. 20 (PTI): The board of Haldia Petrochemicals Limited (HPL) met in New Delhi today, but didnt touch upon the critical issues that strained the relations between the two principal promoters ? The Chatterjee Group and the Bengal government. 

 It was a normal and routine board meeting, said Bengal industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen when asked whether issues such as the case pending before the company law board (CLB) and buying back of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporations shares by TCG were discussed at the meeting.

 The HPL board, which met for the first time since the tussle between the two promoters came out in the open, discussed issues related to the companys performance, Sen said. 

 Purnendu Chatterjee of TCG also said it was a normal board meeting. 

 Asked whether the issue of buying out the state governments shares in HPL by TCG was discussed, he said, It was within the ambit of discussion in the meet. 

 The board meet assumes significance in view of the CLB hearing, which is slated for January 12 and 13.

 Chatterjee, who had moved the CLB seeking a stay on the allotment of fresh shares to Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) by the Bengal government, is keen on an amicable settlement and also ready to withdraw the case pending before the quasi-judicial body. 

 He had also been asked by the state government to submit a written proposal outlining his intention to withdraw the CLB case. Asked whether Chatterjee had given any such proposal during the meeting, Sen said it was an inter-promoter issue and was not discussed. 

 TCG holds nearly 61 per cent of the paid-up equity capital of the company, the Bengal government about 35 per cent and the balance is with the Tatas. The company has reported encouraging performances and is poised to post a record net profit that may wipe out the accumulated losses.

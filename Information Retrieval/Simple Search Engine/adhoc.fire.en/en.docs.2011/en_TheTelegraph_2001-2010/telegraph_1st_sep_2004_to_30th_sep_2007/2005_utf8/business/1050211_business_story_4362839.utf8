 SAIL in supply pact with Gail 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Feb. 10: To tide over coking coal crisis, Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) has signed a deal with Gail for supply of natural gas to run its steel plants. 

 Gail will supply 3.56 million metric standard cubic metre of gas per day (MMSCD) in 2006-07 to SAIL?s plants. SAIL is the first steel producer in the country to opt for gas as an alternative to coking coal.

 The gas will be supplied through the proposed Rs 2,700-crore Jagdishpur-Haldia pipeline of Gail, being laid as part of the company?s grid plan to connect sources of gas to demand centres throughout the country. 

 The gas requirement of different SAIL units in terms of MMSCD is 0.913 for Bhilai, 1.156 for Durgapur, 0.427 for Rourkela and 1.067 for Bokaro. 

 The agreement was signed today by R. Suresh, executive director (marketing) of Gail, and V. Shyamsundar, executive director (corporate planning) of SAIL. 

 Gail CMD Proshanto Banerjee and SAIL chairman V. S. Jain were also present on the occasion.

 SAIL had approached Gail to explore the possibility of obtaining natural gas for bulk usage at its four integrated steel plants. With growing demand for coking coal world over, there has been a shortage of this vital input in steel production.

 SAIL had faced major difficulties in procuring coking coal during the first few months of the current financial year.

 This had prompted the steel major to opt for use of alternate fuels like coal dust injection and coal tar. Once the natural gas is available under the agreement, SAIL can bring down the consumption of coking coal to around one million tonnes per annum.

 Besides, the use of natural gas will strengthen the company?s efforts to provide a cleaner environment, while reducing its dependence on coking coal to some extent. The use of natural gas will also enhance the productivity of furnaces and contribute to reduction in cost of operation.

 The Jagdishpur-Haldia pipeline of Gail is a significant part of the arterial energy flow programme for linking sources of gas to demand centres across the country. The pipeline will have a capacity of 12 MMSCMD, which can be increased to 15 and 21 MMSCMD.

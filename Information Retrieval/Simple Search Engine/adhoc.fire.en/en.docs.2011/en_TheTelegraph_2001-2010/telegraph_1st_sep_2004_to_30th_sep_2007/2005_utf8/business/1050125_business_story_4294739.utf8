 Mumbai, Jan. 24: Mahindra amp; Mahindra Ltd?s third-quarter performance beat market expectations. The company today reported a 52 per cent rise in net profit to Rs 133.2 crore for the October to December period from Rs 87.4 crore posted in the year-ago quarter. 

 The company posted higher earnings despite the rise in input prices by focussing on cost-cutting initiatives. Also, the automotive and farm equipment sectors posted strong sales.

 Total income (net of excise) increased to Rs 1,794.51 crore in the third quarter against Rs 1,347.6 crore in the same period last year.

 M amp;M said the macro-economic indicators continue to be positive and the general mood in the economy is upbeat. ?This augurs well for the growth led by demand,? it said, adding that the pressure from rising steel and other input prices is expected to continue.

 In such a scenario, the company, with a focus on cost and process efficiencies, is looking forward to the rest of the year with confidence, it pointed out.

 Senior company officials said while there was a pressure on material costs, it worked towards reducing the labour cost and other expenses.For the nine month period, net sales and operating income grew by 37 per cent to Rs 4,749.9 crore compared with Rs 3,470 crore last year. Net profit rose 77 per cent at Rs 360 crore against Rs 202.9 crore last year.

 M amp;M?s automotive division registered strong demand during the quarter. Sales of its utility vehicle increased 18 per cent to 28,497 units from 24,087 in the same period last year. 

 The newly-introduced Bolero variants, Scorpio SUV as well as pick-up vehicles aided the growth, Mahindra added.

 Airbus sees a great future

 New Delhi, June 21: Airbus, which had earlier sought a probe into Air-Indias decision to buy aircraft from Boeing, is ready to put the issue to rest and wants to look forward instead.

 What has happened has happened. Time has gone by. We are now focused on the future. Airbus aircraft have emerged as a preferred choice for the airlines in India, Kiran Rao, senior vice-president (sales) of Airbus, said today. 

 Members of Parliament have written letters to the Prime Minister arguing that the offer prices of Airbus aircraft being bought by Indian Airlines and those of Boeing by Air-India are far higher than offers made to other airlines.

 Rao, however, claimed that Airbus had managed to convince Indian Airlines that the prices sought were reasonable. Referring to the recently-concluded Paris air show, Rao said Airbus had bagged orders for supply of 320 aircraft worth $33.5 billion whereas US manufacturer Boeing had received orders worth $15.3 billion for 146 planes.

 He said Indian carriers had led the aircraft buying spree with Air Deccan ordering 32 A-320s and Jet Airways 10 A-330s with the option to buy a similar number more. Kingfisher has ordered 15 aircraft, including five double-decker A-380s, and the start-up airline, InterGlobe, was in the process of placing orders for 100 A-320s.

 Airbus also released a study which said India would need to buy 368 aircraft by 2013 and 570 by 2023. These included at least 20 large aircraft, 371 twin-aisle planes and 123 small single-aisle ones.

 A mere 1.4 crore Indians ? or 1.4 per cent of the countrys billion-plus population ? fly each year. However, rapid economic growth and a surge in budget airlines have seen the airline market growing at about 20-25 per cent. This is catapulting India into the big league for aircraft makers. 

 India and West Asia together recorded around 61 per cent growth in passengers between 2000 and 2004, while the traditionally large aircraft markets of North America recorded a flat growth and Europe saw an increase of only 7 per cent.

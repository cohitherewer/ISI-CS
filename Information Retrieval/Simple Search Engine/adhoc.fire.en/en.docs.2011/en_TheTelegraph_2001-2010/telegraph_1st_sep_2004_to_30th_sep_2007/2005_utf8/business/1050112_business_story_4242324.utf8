 New Delhi, Jan. 11: The power ministry will seek a special rebate for setting up projects in rural areas. It will also seek concessions for distribution and renovation and maintenance of the existing rural power infrastructure.

 A committee which has been preparing the pre-budget ?requests? to be sent to finance minister P. Chidambaram has given a special thrust to rural power projects. It is also discussing the proactive efforts needed to bring in more foreign direct investment in the distribution segment of the power sector.

 The power ministry will also seek a special incentive (financial) package to promote energy conservation in urban areas.

 Efforts will be made to increase the use of solar energy by reducing the cost of solar panels and waiving the minimal levies.

 Sources in the ministry said, ?The power sector has always received necessary support from the finance ministry. However, the focus would be to integrate various benefits available to channel them into rural areas. We will be sending the details to the finance ministry pointing out where they can help in reaching power to every village.?

 The power ministry is also pushing the incentive scheme that was undertaken as a pilot project in a few cities across the country. Under the project, distribution companies operating the 11 kilovolt feeders were given an incentive for higher billing and lower losses. 

 This was welcomed by consumers ? in particular the residential customers ? since they received transparent billing with accounting for each unit consumed.

 A proposal on Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) providing soft loans to state electricity boards at concessional rates is already under the consideration of the finance ministry.

 Another proposal will contain a package to provide electricity to 80,000 villages by 2007 out of which 18,000 villages will be covered under different programmes of the ministry of non-conventional energy. 

 The state electricity boards that need to make capital investment to provide power to the villages may get special interest rates from state electricity boards that may vary from 2-4 per cent. The project will be clubbed with Prime Minister?s Gram Rozgar Yojana and a few others.

 A senior power ministry official said, ?A proposal is under discussion to extend the benefit of special interest rate to private power companies. We are aware that there is unlikely to be a major pull for the private sector to enter the rural areas but proper incentives should help the rural people to get electricity.?

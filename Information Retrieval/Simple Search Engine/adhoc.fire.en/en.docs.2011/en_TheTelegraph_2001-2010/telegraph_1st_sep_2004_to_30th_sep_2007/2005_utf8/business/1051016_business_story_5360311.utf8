 Refco local units put on alert

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 15: The National Stock Exchange (NSE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) today advised Indian entities of US-based Refco Inc not to increase their exposures in the capital and derivatives markets till the implications of the news pertaining to the solvency of Refco Inc are clear.

 The Indian entities of Refco Inc ? Sify Securities India (Refco Sify) and Refco Capital India ? have been advised not to increase their exposures in both the market segments as an interim measure.

 BSE, however, clarified that the exposures of Refco entities to the exchanges are covered by sufficient collaterals.

 US market regulators had recently discovered that Refco CEO Phillip Bennett hid about $430 million (Rs 1,950 crore) in bad debts. 

 The revelation forced the arrest of Bennett. He was later released on bail. The brokerage, which was recently listed on the US bourse, later sacked him.

 Meanwhile, Refco Sify in a late evening rejoinder said it has demonstrated to the stock exchanges that it is not affected by the developments at Refco group in the US.

 According to the rules amp; regulations of the bourse, Refco Sify has segregated all customer funds at all times. The company remains a financially strong brokerage with whom all client funds are segregated at all points of time, Refco said. 

 In order to insulate the company completely from the developments at Refco group, the board of directors of Refco Sify has passed a resolution that no funds will be remitted to any of the Refco groups overseas entities, Refco Sify added. 

 Our operations are not affected by the developments in the US. It is business as usual, Vineet Bhatnagar, managing director of Refco Sify, said.

 Our customers funds are all segregated from the operations of the Refco group in the US. And we have more than enough funds to continue our business and maintain our services, he added. 

 The company has agreed to adhere to the guidance of the exchanges to maintain its current exposure limits.

 The company is a distinct legal entity in India with local investment of 30 per cent by Sify Limited, which has two nominees on the board of Refco Sify, it added.

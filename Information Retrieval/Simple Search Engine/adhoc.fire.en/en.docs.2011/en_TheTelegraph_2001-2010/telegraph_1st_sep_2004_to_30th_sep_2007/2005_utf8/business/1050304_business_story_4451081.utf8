 Tax sops for Punjab, Bina refineries

 S. P. S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, March 3: It?s champagne time for Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum as the decks have been cleared for resuming the stalled projects of the former?s Punjab refinery and the latter?s Bina refinery in Madhya Pradesh with the respective state governments clearing the tax concessions required to give the grassroots ventures a head start.

 Sources say petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar?s warning missive to the Punjab government that Hindustan Petroleum could not wait indefinitely for the tax sops and would have to shift the project to some other state appears to have worked.

 The Punjab government has granted HPCL a sales tax concession of up to Rs 250 crore per year for the first five years. BPCL has got a better deal from the Madhya Pradesh government with a sales tax concession of Rs 250 crore per year for the first 11 years for a smaller refinery.

 HPCL will be investing around Rs 11,000 crore in setting up the 9-million tonne refinery at Bhatinda. It has already invested around Rs 300 crore in acquiring the land and developing the site.

 The BPCL project entails an investment of Rs 6,354 crore in the 6-million tonne Bina refinery with a foreign exchange component of Rs 2,025 crore at September 2002 prices. This estimate is expected to be revised to factor in the cost escalation due to the delay.

 HPCL was going full stream ahead with the Punjab refinery project at Bhatinda but ran into a brick wall with the Congress government coming into power in the state. Chief minister Amarinder Singh had refused to clear the tax concessions granted by the Akali Dal government headed by his predecessor Parkash Singh Badal on grounds that the tax waivers would drain the state of a major chunk of revenue. The project had ground to a halt as the state government had refused to budge for the last three years.

 The delay has not been without its cost as in the meantime Indian Oil has forged ahead with doubling the capacity of its Panipat refinery from 6 million tonnes to 12 million tonnes in neighbouring Haryana.

 The BPCL project, which had been cleared in 1995, was bogged down because the Gujarat government had delayed the environment clearance to its crude oil pipeline. This was widely seen as a move by the state government to protect the interest of the Reliance refinery in Jamnagar, which was coming up at the same time.

 The delay also led to BPCLs joint venture partner, Oman Oil company, backing out of the project. As a result, precious time was lost in working out the new investment pattern.

 The petroleum ministry?s ill-conceived policy of forcing the public sector oil companies to go in for joint ventures with foreign partners during the mid-nineties had similarly delayed Indian Oil?s Paradip refinery with Kuwait Petroleum pulling out at the last minute.

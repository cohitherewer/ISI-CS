 Calcutta, July 12: Uco Bank has shortlisted five consultants ? Ernst amp; Young, McKinsey, Boston Consulting Group, IBM Consultancy and National Institute of Banking Management (NIBM) ? to prepare a revamp model required to meet its ambitious business targets.

 The consultants will make a presentation this week. We will zero in on the consultant based on that, chairman and managing director V. Sridar said on the sidelines of the Banking Conclave organised by Ficci (eastern region).

 The bank is also waiting for the Reserve Banks decision on a new instrument for raising Tier I capital. 

 The report is expected to be tabled within the next one month, added Sridar.

 The organisational revamp model will also take into consideration the increase in tier I capital. If the new instrument is suitable for us then we will go ahead with it or we may go in for the second public issue, added Sridar.

 The capital adequacy of the bank as on March 31, 2005, stood at 11.2 per cent. We are short of capital. The capital adequacy will come down to 10 per cent by March 2006. We need to raise capital as soon as possible, he added.

 The bank has firmed up plans to raise Rs 200 crore as tier II capital in the current financial year.

 The banks disbursement in the first three months of 2005-06 was Rs 1,100 crore. However, the absolute growth was Rs 300 crore as some of the short term loans sanctioned earlier were disbursed in April.

 Uco Banks deposit growth has been stagnant. This is the general trend in the banking industry in the first three quarters. Liquidity management is a problem in the first quarter. Deposits will show an upward trend in the last two quarters, he said.

 Uco Bank has decided to give more emphasis on selling of insurance and mutual fund products to augment fee-based income.

 Watchful Sebi takes time to clear Jet IPO

 Bajpai: Taking a close look

 Bangalore, Jan. 22 (PTI): The Securities and Exchange Board of India has been studying the Jet Airways? draft IPO with particular care because it is the first time an airline in India is seeking to go public.

 Sebi chairman G. N. Bajpai said here today his colleagues were taking more time than usual to clear the airline?s IPO proposal because they needed a thorough understanding of the airline business in order to protect investors? interest.

 ?When I asked my colleagues about the Jet Airways? proposal, they said it would take a couple of days more. I asked them why it should take a couple of days more, and they said since it?s the first airline company?s IPO; they want to understand the business... Broad features so that investors? interests are protected,? the Sebi chairman said.

 Bajpai made the comments in the context of the role of Sebi as the market regulator, while delivering the key-note address at the 17th annual conference of the Karnataka State Chartered Accountants Association which had the theme ?Networking knowledge horizon?.

 The largest private sector domestic airline in India has proposed to offer 17,266,801 equity shares of Rs 10 each for cash at a price to be determined through a book-building process.

 The Sebi chairman said corporate governance was ?very important? and was a ?societal issue?, and emphasised the role of chartered accountants in this context. 

 While lauding the role of accountants for being ?guardians of public interest?, Bajpai urged them to work more on standards. While accounting standards in India are among the best in the world, it needs ?some refinement? which he hoped that CAs would undertake on a continuous and sustained basis given their ?operational efficiencies?.

 He exhorted CAs to update their knowledge in tune with the times, ?move beyond connectivity?, create a matrix of solutions and network.

 Karnataka?s cooperation minister R. V. Deshpande spoke about poor auditing standards in the cooperatives and said he is seriously contemplating to restructure the sector to bring in transparency with the involvement of professionals.

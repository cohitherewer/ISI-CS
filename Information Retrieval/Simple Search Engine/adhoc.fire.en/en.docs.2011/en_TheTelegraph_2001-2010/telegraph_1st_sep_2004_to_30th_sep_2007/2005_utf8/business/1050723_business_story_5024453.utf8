 Calcutta, July 22: Samsung India plans to restructure its retail strategy to focus on the youth and lifestyle segment. The company wants to display its new range of digital products through IT channels and audio-video retail stores, besides the existing outlets.

 We have launched three products ? audio players, slim cameras and camcorders ? which are focused on the youth and people who use lifestyle products. The digital audio-video range currently contributes 15 per cent of the total turnover, which is expected to grow to 30 per cent next year, Samsung India managing director Ravinder Zutshi said. The company has targeted a turnover of Rs 6500 crore for its current accounting year (Jan-Dec 2005) against Rs 4900 crore achieved last year. Consumer products have contributed 53 per cent to the turnover.

 The domestic digital still camera market is growing at 25 per cent. IDC estimates that 200,000 units were sold last year. This is expected to go up to 2.8 lakh units next year. Samsung expects a 20-30 per cent rise in market share in the next two to three years.

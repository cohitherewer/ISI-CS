 Price cut rankles bandwidth providers

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, April 3: Telecom service providers feel that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) was not justified in reducing bandwidth prices by up to 70 per cent.

 A white paper, which was prepared based on Trai?s recommendations on international private leased circuit (IPLC) tariff ceilings, calls the price cut an optical illusion.

 Sources close to VSNL said the IPLC leased rental, which is charges paid for using the services of the international leased circuits, is a very small component ? merely 4 to 5 per cent ? of the total cost structure. The last mile access and NLD constitute 35 to 40 per cent of the cost.

 In order to encourage broadband penetration, all the key components are required to be rationalised rather than the IPLC, which is the smallest component, states the white paper.

 As a result of the price slash, bandwidth operators expect a 35 per cent drop in revenue. 

 The industry also feels that contrary to perception, ILD voice tariffs will fall only marginally. The international bandwidth is a mere 5 per cent of the ILD voice tariff and even a drop of 70 per cent will result in a mere 30 paise reduction on an average call of Rs 10 per minute.

 The service providers feel that the critical issue hampering the growth of broadband is the unbundling of the local loop, which acts as the last mile access. This large copper network is controlled by BSNL and MTNL.

 ?The use of international connectivity is limited to the IT and ITeS industry and big companies. Domestic and last mile connectivity affects everyone, irrespective of the size,? said sources.

 The white paper also mentions that price reductions in trans-Atlantic markets have resulted in several companies going bankrupt, which were then sold at 5 to 7 per cent of the original build cost. The acquisition of FLAG by Reliance and Tyco Global Network by VSNL are examples.

 Bajaj sets June date for family truce

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 10: The family squabble within the Bajaj group will be settled by June. 

 Bajaj Auto chairman Rahul Bajaj says he expects to seal the settlement with his younger brother Shishir over their cross-holdings in group companies by the middle of this year.

 ?By June-end, the family settlement will be over and it will be behind us. The sooner the better,? Bajaj told reporters on the sidelines of an industry conference here today.

 The over three-year old family battle pits Shishir against brother Rahul and their cousins Shekhar, Niraj and Madhur. It stemmed from a demand by Shishir Bajaj for a clear division of the assets and doing away with the cross-holdings between different group companies. Shishir runs Bajaj Hindustan and Bajaj Consumercare, while brother Rahul runs the flagship company, Bajaj Auto.

 The two sides had signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in December 2003 and an arbitration award was made in February 2004. However, Shishir had raised fresh demands that complicated the original settlement. Rahul and his cousins stood firm and forced Shishir to back down on the new demands. 

 Under the terms of the settlement, Shishir Bajaj will buy out Rahul and Madhur Bajaj?s stakes in Bajaj Hindustan and Bajaj Consumercare. Rahul and the others will, in turn, buy out Shishir?s 5.7 per cent stake in Bajaj Automobiles.

 The Pune-based Bajaj Auto is also on course to pick up a 27 per cent stake in Maharashtra Scooters. Rahul Bajaj said the company hopes to acquire the stake by June.

 Bajaj said he expected the Pune-based two-wheeler company to post sales of about 1.8 million units in the financial year that ends on March 31.

 Rahul Bajaj?s decision last week to relinquish his executive powers at Bajaj Auto and name son Rajiv as the managing director of the two-wheeler manufacturer from April 1 was a clear indication that a settlement was at hand. He had also said that he has demarcated the areas of operation between his sons Rajiv and Sanjiv.

 Rajiv Bajaj, who is the elder son, will look after marketing, supply-chain management, manufacturing, engineering and product development. For the younger son, Sanjiv Bajaj, the earmarked areas are international marketing, finance and treasury, legal affairs of the company and issues pertaining to the development of human resources.

 Sanjiv will also be entrusted with the task of looking after the corporate governance issues that concern the company.

 Bajaj Auto is the second-biggest motorcycle maker in the country.

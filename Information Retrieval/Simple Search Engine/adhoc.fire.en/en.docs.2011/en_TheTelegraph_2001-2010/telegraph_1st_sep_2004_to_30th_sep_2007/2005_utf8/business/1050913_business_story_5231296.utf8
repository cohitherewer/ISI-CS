 Bharti dream fails to get airborne as Changi dithers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Revamp woes

 New Delhi, Sept. 12: The Bharti-Changi Airport combine has dropped out of the race to grab the right to modernise Delhi and Mumbai airports.

 Speculation about such a move has swirled for over a week after the Changi Airport Authority of Singapore expressed strong reservations over one of the bid conditions that required the bidders to stump up a performance guarantee of $80 million. 

 The bids close on Thursday (September 15).

 Bharti is dismayed at this development as it was very enthusiastic about participating in this opportunity to create a world-class airport in Delhi, the telecom major said. 

 The Indian partners of Changi ? Bharti and the DLF group ? said they felt while the conditions laid down in the tender are challenging, they can be met with commitment from all partners. Both Bharti and DLF are confident about building a world-class airport at Delhi, complying with all the terms of the tender. However, they cannot proceed without the commitment of Changi, as it is an essential qualification criteria to have an airport operator participate in the bidding process.

 The problem was not just with the fiscal pre-conditions. There were other issues as well, said a Bharti official but he refused to elaborate. He said the other bidding consortia could also run into similar problems. 

 However, a spokesperson for Bhartis main rival in the telecom market, Reliance said, We remain strong contenders for both the airports ? Delhi and Mumbai. Sources added that they had heard no objections from Kuala Lumpur Airport which is partnering Reliance in the venture and the group would submit the bid papers on Thursday.

 Bharti group chief Sunil Mittal said, Airports are modern day cathedrals and have come to represent the economic development of any country ... (we) wish the chosen bidders success in creating world-class airports at Delhi and Mumbai.

 Bharti officials said, We had chosen Changi as our partner because of its reputation as the best in its class ... but our efforts have been frustrated with Changis unwillingness to commit to the key terms of the tender.

 Civil aviation ministry officials said that it was difficult to change bid norms which were announced recently at this late stage, though there would be talks within an inter-ministry group set up on this issue. They also added that performance guarantees were usually the norm in most global bids and were usually paid by the implementing partner, which in this case would be the foreign party. 

 However, if any combine wants to share the guarantee costs equally that is their look out. The government will not stand in the way, officials said.

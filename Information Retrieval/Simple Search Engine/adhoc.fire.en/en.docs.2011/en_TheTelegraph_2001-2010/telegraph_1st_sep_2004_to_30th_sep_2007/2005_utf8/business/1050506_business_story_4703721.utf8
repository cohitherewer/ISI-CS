 Push to consolidation

 SATISH JOHN 

 Mumbai, May 5: The central governments move to lift the 10 per cent voting right limit is being viewed as a big positive that can spur consolidation in the banking sector.

 HSBC, a leading foreign bank that is likely to gain from this legislation, declined to comment. However, Rabo India Finance Pvt Ltd was more forthcoming. ?We welcome the decision and see it as a very progressive and forward looking step,? said an official of Rabo India Finance. 

 Bankers feel that the governments move to remove the 10 per cent cap on voting rights will foster consolidation in the countrys banking sector. The proposed amendment to the Banking Regulation Act 1949 will make investment in and acquisition of Indian banks more attractive to foreign banks. 

 The removal of the ceiling on voting rights had been a long-standing demand of foreign and private banks that are keen on tapping the growing Indian market.

 However, banks like HSBC are quiet because of conflicting signals from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The RBI said any shareholder who wants to increase the shareholding above 5 per cent will have to get the apex banks approval.

 Senior officials of public sector banks say the Reserve Bank norm still holds good even after the government unleashed reforms in the sector. 

 ?It is necessary to ensure the type of promoters getting into banks. After all, banking is the most leveraged business in the world. A bank can do business of more than 10 times its capital, making it necessary for the sector to be well-regulated.?

 India has suddenly turned attractive for foreign banks as credit offtake is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years. The weaker banks could serve as a channel for stronger banks and through their acquisition foreign banks, too, can increase their footprints across the length and breadth of the country.

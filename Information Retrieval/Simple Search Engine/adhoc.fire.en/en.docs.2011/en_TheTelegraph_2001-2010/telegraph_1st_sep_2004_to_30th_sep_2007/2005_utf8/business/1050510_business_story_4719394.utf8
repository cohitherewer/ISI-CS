 Barclays returns to Africa

 Johannesburg/London, May 9 (Reuters): Britains Barclays is set for a historic return to South Africa with a $5.56-billion deal, the biggest single direct foreign investment in the country. Barclays will pick up a 60 per cent stake in the Johannesburg-based bank Absa. 

 The long-awaited deal, likely to be announced today, will mark Barclays return to retail banking in South Africa. The British bank was forced to quit in 1986, at a loss, amid pressure over the countrys white minority rule. 

 The deal also represent a major vote of confidence in the South African economy. 

 To win over Absas small shareholders, Britains third-largest bank raised its offer from 79 rand per share to 82.50 rand plus a special dividend of 1.80 rand, valuing the transaction at 33.17 billion rand ($5.56 billion), according to financial grapevine. 

 Absas share price has risen by 33 per cent since Barclays said in September last it was in talks about a majority stake. The price originally mooted was 45 rand per Absa share, a source close to the transaction said. 

 South Africas finance minister Trevor Manuel approved Barclays offer on Sunday, saying the potential advantages of a deal outweighed the possible risks. 

 Economists are hopeful that following Barclays deal for Absa, other foreign companies too will follow the UK banks lead and foreign direct investment (FDI), which is relatively meagre in South Africa up till now, will gather pace. 

 William Claxton-Smith, a fund manager at Insight, which owns around 1.5 per cent of Barclays, said the market would welcome a deal finally being sealed: ?Investors will be pretty relieved that it will all be over. It has dragged on for a bit.? 

 Barclays, keen to expand overseas amid declining consumer borrowing in England, warned earlier this month it would walk away from the transaction if small shareholders blocked its offer. 

 The UK bank had been trying for a majority control in Absa, but let existing investors share in the expected benefits from the deal.

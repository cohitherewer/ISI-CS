 Calcutta, March 29: Vijaya Bank will appoint National Institute of Banking Management (NIBM) to work out a roadmap to implement operational autonomy in the bank.

 The move comes in the wake of the Reserve Bank?s recent decision to provide more autonomy to public sector banks.

 Executive director M. Aftab said the bank will seek autonomy in credit disbursal, investment, recruitment policy, remuneration package for the employees, branch expansion and wage agreement.

 ?We will soon finalise a deal with NIBM to draw up a blueprint to implement this autonomy package over a period of time,? he said.

 Vijaya Bank, in which the government holding is around 53 per cent, has recently raised a Tier-II capital of Rs 250 crore. The capital adequacy ratio of the bank is a little over 14 per cent.

 ?As far as the capital is concerned, we are in a comfortable position and we do not see further infusion in the next two years. Our present capital will also take care of the Basel-II norms,? said Aftab.

 The bank today opened its 903rd branch in the city and 25th in Bengal. The bank has 42 branches in the eastern region. ?We are aiming 1,000 branches in the next one year,? Aftab said.

 The bank is aiming for a business of Rs 52,000 crore by 2006, which was Rs 36,852 crore on March 31, 2004.

 ?The advances of the bank grew by 28 per cent in the current financial year. The retail growth has been very high. Nearly 33 per cent of our advances went to the retail sector. We would like to achieve a retail portfolio, which contributes 50 per cent of our total business,? Aftab added.

 The focus of the bank will be on the SMEs and the retail sector. The bank has recruited 80 people and will be employing another 170 soon.

 The bank also plans to spread its wings in the international arena. It has applied for opening branches in Korea, Gulf, Hong Kong and Singapore.

 Calcutta, Oct. 19: The Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) will hold its first meeting with the Indian Banks Association (IBA) tomorrow to discuss a cluster-based approach for financing small units.

 We are going to hold our first meeting with the IBA tomorrow at Mumbai on cluster-based approach of financing small enterprises according to the directive of the Union finance minister, Sidbi chairman and managing director N. Balasubramanian said.

 As part of the policy package to step up credit to small and medium enterprises, the finance minister had directed Sidbi and the IBA to initiate necessary steps to collect and pool common data on risks in each identified clusters and develop an IT-enabled application, appraisal and monitoring system for small, including tiny, enterprises.

 According to the directive, a cluster-based approach for financing the SME sector might reduce transaction costs, mitigate risks and also provide an appropriate scale for improvement in infrastructure. About 388 clusters have already been identified, he said.

 Looking at the benefits of the cluster-based approach, banks may treat it as a thrust area and increasingly adopt the same for financing SMEs. Balasubramanian said this approach would help in reducing transaction costs as well as improve credit flow to the small and tiny enterprises. To broaden the financing options for infrastructure development in clusters through public-private partnership, Sidbi will formulate a scheme in consultation with the stakeholders.

 Srei tie-up

 Sidbi has also signed a memorandum of understanding with Srei Infrastructure Finance Limited to extend credit facility to SMEs in the construction sector.

 We will initially target a disbursement figure of Rs 30 crore, which will be stepped up in the future, based on the response, Srei vice-chairman and MD Hemant Kanoria said.

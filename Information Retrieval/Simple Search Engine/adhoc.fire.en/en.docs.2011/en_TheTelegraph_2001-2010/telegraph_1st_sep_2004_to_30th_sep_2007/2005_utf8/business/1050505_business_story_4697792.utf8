 New Delhi, May 4: Union commerce minister Kamal Nath today called for a development audit of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations as the first step towards adopting a development package at the next ministerial conference in Hong Kong. 

 Nath pitched for activating the development agenda in the WTO talks while addressing the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) meeting in Paris. 

 According to a commerce ministry statement, the minister urged the advanced nations not to forget that the Doha meet was supposed to be primarily a development round. 

 The minister has also discussed critical WTO issues with fellow G-20 members, including China, Brazil and South Africa. 

 The OECD meeting deliberated upon the strategy to be pursued in particular reference to converting specific duties to ad valorem tax. 

 It is to be noted that this particular issue has created roadblocks to agricultural negotiations at different WTO rounds. 

 The developed countries are applying specific duties that result in high tariffs for a wide range of agricultural products in which the developing countries have high export interest. 

 The developing countries, however, have bound their tariffs ad valorem. 

 Nath have brought this debating point home. ?On the same products, we cannot have duty rates in the developed countries which are five or ten times higher than those in the developing countries,? he said.

 The minister also met with the G-10 group of developed nations such as Japan and Switzerland which are also interested in protecting their farmers. 

 Nath said, ?India would respect their sensibilities in agriculture if they respect Indias concerns. Agriculture is not about numbers, it is about people.?

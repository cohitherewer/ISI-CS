 India Inc wary of price spikes

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: India Inc is worried that higher oil prices would raise inflation and this would erode the competitiveness of local companies, though it termed the hike as reasonable. 

 The Institute of Economic Growth said the oil price hike could raise inflation marginally to 3.3 per cent from around 3.1 per cent now. 

 The rate could, however, increase to 4 per cent in coming months when the impact of inflationary pressures will sink in. Inflationary impact and greater money supply is also expected to exert pressure on interest rates in the medium term. 

 The government would have done well to take this opportunity to raise the prices of kerosene and LPG by reducing cross subsidies, said K.N. Memani, president of PHDCCI.

 While accepting the inevitability of price increase, the Confederation of Indian Industry urged the government to take the issue of hydrocarbon pricing out of the political arena.

 Ficci president Onkar S. Kanwar said the hike was unavoidable and the quantum of increase was reasonable in the light of the huge losses suffered by oil marketing companies.

 He said the government would do well to promote energy conservation and efficiency along with development of alternative sources of energy as a long term strategy. 

 Ficci, however, called for setting up strategic petroleum reserves and geographical diversification of oil imports.

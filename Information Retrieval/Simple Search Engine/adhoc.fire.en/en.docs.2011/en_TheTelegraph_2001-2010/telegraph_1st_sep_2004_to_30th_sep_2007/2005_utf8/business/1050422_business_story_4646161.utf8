 Corp Bank profit slips to Rs 350 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 21: Corporation Bank?s net profit for 2004-05 dipped 33.93 per cent to Rs 350.69 crore from Rs 530.83 crore in the previous year, weighed down by lower treasury income and higher provisions for bad debts.

 The board has recommended a dividend of 35 per cent in a move that will cost it Rs 57.52 crore. The total dividend, including 30 per cent interim payout, for 2004-05 is 65 per cent, chairman and managing director V. K. Chopra said. 

 Total income fell to Rs 2,762.27 crore from Rs 2,813.28 crore in 2003-04. While interest earnings increased marginally to Rs 2,295.27 crore from Rs 2,276.48 crore last year, other income slipped to Rs 467 crore from Rs 536.80 crore.

 Chopra said there were a variety of factors behind the profit slide but lower income from investments in government bonds and a bigger hedge against doubtful and bad loans were the two of the biggest drags on the bottomline.

 The depreciation on investments due to shifting of a major portion of government bonds from ?available for sale? to ?held-to-maturity? category squeezed profits, Chopra said. 

 The total business of the Mangalore-based public sector bank, including advances and deposits, rose to Rs 45,780 crore on March 31 from Rs 37,080 crore same time last year. 

 Net profit for the fourth-quarter dropped to Rs 107.57 crore from Rs 119.49 crore in the same period of the previous year. Total income stood at Rs 703.25 crore against Rs 648.41 crore in January-March of 2004, Chopra said.

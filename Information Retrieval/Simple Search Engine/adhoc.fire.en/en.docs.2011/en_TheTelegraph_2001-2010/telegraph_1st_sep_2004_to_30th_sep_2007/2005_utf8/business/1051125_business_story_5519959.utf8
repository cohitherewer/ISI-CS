 Aiyar chides Raha

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 24: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today took ONGC chairman Subir Raha to task for delaying by over six months the mandatory production MoU that the company was supposed to sign with the government for this fiscal. Every year, oil PSUs sign a memorandum of understanding with the government stipulating the crude production target for the year. 

 He has also accused Raha of rigging the minutes of ONGC board meetings to obscure the views expressed by government-appointed directors. 

 Quoting official records, Aiyar said the task force of the department of public enterprises (DPE) had clearly recommended on April 13 that the performance of ONGC-Videshs (OVL) overseas ventures should be included in the MoU and the target for ONGCs domestic oil and gas production should be enhanced, if possible, based on the companys own technical assessment. 

 Raha, however, had not implemented this recommendation, he said. While there is no move to review the navratna status of ONGC, the matter has been referred to the DPE to decide on the next course of action, Aiyar added.

 The minister said Raha had taken the stand that since OVL was not included in MoUs in the past, as a matter of principle, it should not be included now either. 

 Official records show that joint secretary P.K. Sinha had, on May 18, written to Raha that the draft MoU sent by him did not include the performance of OVL or the enhanced production target for domestic crude oil and gas as recommended by the DPE task force. 

 Raha was sent a copy of the DPE recommendation and asked to submit an MoU incorporating the new norms. But six months and six days have passed since the letter was sent and the ministry has not received the MoU, Aiyar said.

 He said the DPE recommendations were discussed at the three successive board meetings of ONGC in June and July when the government directors had clearly stated that the new guidelines should be followed. 

 However, the minutes of the meetings prepared by the ONGC staff and signed by the chairman did not reflect this view at all, the minister said.

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority today issued new guidelines on unit-linked life insurance plans (ULIPs), which mandates a minimum insurance cover and allows only partial withdrawal of money. The guidelines are intended to ensure greater transparency and understanding of these products to the insured. It proposes to extend the minimum insurance cover to be offered under the products (except for pension and annuity products) and implement certain prudent practices on other features of ULIP products like partial withdrawals and top-up premiums to offer more flexibility and long-term protection to the insured.

 Tata Intl scales the Chinese wall

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 23: Tata International Limited, the countrys largest global trading company, has opened its new marketing office and leather showroom in Dong Guan in China. 

 Situated in Chinas most prosperous Guang Dong province, Dong Guan is the hub for footwear exports out of China. 

 The city with a population of 6 million accounts for 60 per cent of the countrys total footwear exports. It has acquired the status of the new footwear capital of the world. 

 Global footwear brands based in the US and Europe, which are the principal customers for the finished leather business of Tata International, source their shoes from Dong Guan, which is why Tata International has set up its showroom and marketing office in Dong Guan, the company said. 

 Tata Internationals major markets are Europe, SAARC, Asean, West Asia, the Far East and Oceania countries. Its other markets are the Americas and Africa.

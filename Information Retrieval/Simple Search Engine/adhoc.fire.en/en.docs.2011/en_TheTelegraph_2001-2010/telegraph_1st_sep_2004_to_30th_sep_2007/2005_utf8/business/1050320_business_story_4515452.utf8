 IMF forecasts 6.7% growth

 New Delhi, March 19 (PTI): Terming the reform agenda of the 2005-06 budget as ?very positive?, the International Monetary Fund today pegged India?s economic growth at 6.7 per cent for the next fiscal and praised the countrys monetary management to absorb the oil shocks to keep prices low.

 ?We think that the actual rate of growth looks like 7.5-8 per cent in the medium term. That?s a healthy objective,? IMF managing director Rodrigo de Rato said, adding the growth is likely to be 6.7 per cent next fiscal.

 ?Growth in India has been robust reaching nearly 7 per cent in this fiscal. There is keen awareness of the need to continue to strengthen Indias fiscal position, open the economy more fully to the world and remove the remaining domestic constraints on growth,? he said.

 Appreciative of the budget for allocating more resources to social and infrastructure sectors, he said the ?pause? in reducing revenue deficit will not significantly impact the fiscal reforms started last year. However, he said India needs to accelerate and broaden reforms, especially trade-related.

 Rato had meetings with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, finance minister P. Chidambaram, commerce minister Kamal Nath and RBI governor Y. V. Reddy during his three-day visit to India.

 Lauding the RBI for its policies, he said ?the RBI has skillfully conducted its monetary policies, and has managed to contain inflation at acceptable levels despite the rapid rise in world oil prices last year.?

 He, however, said ?more needs to be done to build a strong and competitive financial sector.?

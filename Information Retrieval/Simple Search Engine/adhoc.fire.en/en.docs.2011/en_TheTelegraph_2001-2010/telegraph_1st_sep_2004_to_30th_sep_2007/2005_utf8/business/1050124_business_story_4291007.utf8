 Theme parks to have a field day

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 23: The amusement parks industry is likely to grow by 48 per cent to touch Rs 3,000 crore by 2006, according to the Indian Association of Amusement Parks and Industries (IAAPI).

 The industry has recorded an impressive growth of 56 per cent since 2002 in terms of the number of parks and the total area. 

 ?There is no doubt that the amusement industry is booming. Millions of people are on the lookout for world-class entertainment avenues,? association president Balwant Chawla said.

 ?The sector has high potential for investments by locals and foreigners,? he said.

 Ashok Goel, director of Pan India Paryatan Ltd (Essel World and Water Kingdom), and former president of IAAPI, said, ?Investments could manifest into theme parks, water parks, multiplexes, family entertainment centres, interactive arcades, food courts and sports zones. India has emerged as a long-term potential investment destination because of a scarcity of family entertainment options,? he said. 

 IAAPI is trying to get the amusement and leisure industry acknowledged as a vital part of social infrastructure, which will exempt it from entertainment tax.

 Cap on stake sale in airlines

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Patel: Setting limits

 New Delhi, Nov. 18: State-run carriers Air-India and Indian Airlines can offload up to 20 per cent stake by way of initial public offers, which are slated to hit the market by the beginning of the next financial year.

 Not more than 20 per cent equity will be offered in these two carriers. Their public sector status will be maintained, civil aviation minister Praful Patel told the economic editors conference in New Delhi today. A 20 per cent stake in these two airlines is estimated to fetch around Rs 4,000 crore. 

 The two airlines will offer employees stock options as part of the IPO. 

 Both the airlines are in an expansion mode. While IA wants to buy some 43 Airbuses, Air-India will buy 68 Boeing aircraft. The total cost of these big-ticket purchases is expected to be nearly Rs 45,000 crore. Hence, the airlines want to perk up their equity base in order to leverage the huge loans required to fund the fleet-expansion plans. 

 Patel said the two airlines need more financial muscle and more equity. We cannot just do with the equity injected by the government, if they have to face the competition. 

 The government will infuse about Rs 350 crore as equity in Indian Airlines.

 Referring to the recent mergers in the global aviation industry ? like KLM being taken over by Air France ? the minister said the two airlines require greater synergy in operations. Even in the domestic aviation business, some airlines are talking about consolidation.

 Patel also said the domestic aviation industry, which has seen hectic aircraft buying in the past one year, would expand by 25-30 per cent this fiscal and by 25 per cent a year over the next five years. 

 The investment in this sector is going to be one of the highest in the country, he said. We will see investments of more than $30 billion by 2012 and $50 billion in 10 years. 

 Indian airports handled 59.54 million domestic and international passengers in 2004-05, compared with 40 million in the previous year. 

 Patel said the Airports Authority of India would raise about Rs 6,000 crore and upgrade and modernise 35 non-metro airports in one go. 

 The work will begin by 2006-07 and end by 2008-09, he added. 

 The minister said talks are on with the Planning Commission about mobilising resources for this purpose.

 Boeing returns Airbus fire on Air-India deal

 OUR BUREAU

 Keskar: Plane-speak

 New Delhi, May 4: Boeing Corporation of the US today fired a broadside against Airbus Industrie, accusing the French commercial aircraft maker of proving to be a bad sport after losing out on the recent Air-India deal.

 Last week, the Air-India board decided to buy 50 aircraft from Boeing in a deal that is valued at close to Rs 30,000 crore ($6.9 billion), making it the country?s biggest aircraft purchase deal.

 Boeing?s pointman in India ? Dinesh Keskar ? told reporters here today that it was incredible that the Airbus had demanded a corruption investigation into the Air-India deal by the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC).

 ?It is absolutely incredible that Airbus is questioning Air-India?s evaluation (for purchase of aircraft). There is no doubt about Air-Indias evaluation process and tender norms.... It can stand any scrutiny,? the senior vice-president (sales) of Boeing said.

 He said it was for the government and the airline to decide whether or not to order a CVC probe.

 The Boeing deal is yet to be cleared by the Union cabinet.

 The Air-India board had decided to buy 27 B787, eight B777?200 Long Range and 15 777-300 extended range aircraft from Boeing.

 Keskar said when Boeing lost the Indian Airlines contract to Airbus, it had not demanded a CVC probe. 

 ?We did not get a reply from IA. It is entirely up to the airlines to take a decision regarding their fleet acquisition plan,? Keskar said.

 The Airbus argument is built around the fact that the Boeing 787 would not be ready for production by 2007 and Air-India?s committee had flouted the rules of the tender by considering the model. It also protested that Air-India had chosen a nine-abreast seat configuration, which runs counter to those on international airlines.

 Air-India has already rubbished Airbus? claims and argued that it had the sole discretion to decide on both the model and the seat configuration.

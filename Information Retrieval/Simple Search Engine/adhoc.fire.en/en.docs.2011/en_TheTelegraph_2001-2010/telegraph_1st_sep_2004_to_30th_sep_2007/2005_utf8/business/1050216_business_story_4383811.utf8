 OVL sets sights on Caspian Sea block

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: ONGC-Videsh (OVL) is eyeing mid-sized oil exploration blocks in the Caspian Sea off Kazakhstan. 

 A delegation headed by petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar will leave for Kazakhstan to hold talks on a broad front in the hydrocarbon sector and the promotion of trade. This will form part of the meeting of the India- Kazakhstan joint commission. 

 Briefing journalists on the eve of his departure, Aiyar said the objective of his visit was to convey the message that India was serious in long-term investments over the broad range of hydrocarbon activities. These included seismic surveys of unexplored territory in the energy-rich country.

 He said talks were on for the Kummangazi oil exploration block in Kazakhstan but this would not be the main focus of his visit. 

 Aiyar emphasised that he would focus on the wider perspective and building a long-term relationship, rather than on acquiring discovered oilfields.

 OVL, which had closed down its office in Almaty earlier, will be re-opening it as part of the thrust to promote co-operation in the hydrocarbon sector. The India-Kazakhstan joint commission would be meeting after three years, he added. 

 Helping Kazakhstan with new enhanced oil recovery techniques developed by ONGC for its ageing fields would also be included in the talks.

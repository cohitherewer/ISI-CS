 REL results meet on Jan 19

 Anil: Check it out

 Mumbai, Jan. 3: Reliance Energy today announced that its board will meet on January 19 to consider unaudited financial results for the three months ended December. 

 High on the agenda of the meeting will be quarterly pay-outs, as part of a declared policy to give regular dividends. The record date for the payment will be December 31.

 The Anil Ambani-headed firm had been in the spotlight recently after six of its directors, including one who held office in an independent capacity, resigned from the board.

 On December 12, two of its independent directors sought clarifications on the commitment of Reliance Industries (RIL), REL?s main shareholder, on the availability and cost of Krishna-Godavari gas. The letter from V. P. Malik and Leena Srivastava said Reliance Industries should clear the air on issues crucial to the 3500-MW Dadri power project in Uttar Pradesh. 

 Referring to reports suggesting Reliance Industries has pushed back by two years the supply of gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin to 2008, from 2006, Malik and Srivastava referred to a Petrowatch interview quoting Mukesh Ambani as saying it could only happen by 2008. 

 Observers tracking the Ambani sibling spat said the letter is significant because both the writers were individuals known for their ?integrity and reputation in their fields?. Malik is a former chief of the Indian Army.

 Not only Reliance Energy but the Uttar Pradesh government have laid great store by the Dadri project. The Mukesh-controlled RIL indicated it was not consulted on the project, though REL said both firms cleared it. 

 Reliance Energy is India?s leading private sector utility group, with revenues of Rs 7,700 crore and assets of Rs 9,800 crore. It distributes nearly 16,000 million units of power to over 25 million customers in Mumbai, Delhi, Orissa and Goa.

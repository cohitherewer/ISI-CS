 Plane deal signals IA global flight path

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 16: The Indian Airlines board today approved the lease of a dozen wide-bodied aircraft in anticipation of the government allowing it to fly on global routes. 

 Civil aviation minister Praful Patel had earlier said that one of the reasons IA had not been allowed to fly on international routes other than to the Gulf and Southeast Asia was that it did not have enough planes. 

 Indian Airline sources said the wide-bodied aircraft are being ordered as the government is likely to allow it to fly on more international routes. The airline had already decided last year to buy some 43 Airbuses to augment its existing fleet and as replacements for ageing aircraft. 

 While flight routes to the lucrative United Kingdom sector for this summer have already been awarded, route allocations to the US and to countries in the Far East are yet to be made. 

 Civil aviation sources said that till now only Jet and Air- India have applied for flights to the US. A-I already has a few flights and is planning to launch another to Seattle this weekend. 

 Jet Airways also decided today to lease up to three wide bodied aircraft for its long distance, high-density route flights. It will make up its mind between a Boeing 777 and a 747 on the one hand and Airbus A330 and A340 on the other. IA officials said they planned to lease either Airbus or Boeing aircraft for operations proposed for winter 2005 and summer 2006.

 Officials said in an earlier board meeting, the airline had approved the leasing of six wide bodied aircraft to operate on certain routes within existing international stations of the IA network along with three more wide-bodied aircraft to be leased as replacement of A-300 B4 aircraft. 

 ?However, in view of the recent opening up of international connectivity, IA plans additional services. This has led to a need for leased aircraft. quot;

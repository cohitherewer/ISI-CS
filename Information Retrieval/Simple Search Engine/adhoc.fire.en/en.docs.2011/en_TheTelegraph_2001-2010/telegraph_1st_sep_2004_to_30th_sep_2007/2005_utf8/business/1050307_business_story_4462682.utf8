 Telecom players upbeat

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, March 6: After years of steadily declining revenues, the domestic telecom manufacturing industry is upbeat and expects to grow from Rs 14,000 crore this year to Rs 40,000 crore in 2006-07. The industry had garnered Rs 15,000 crore last year.

 The sector will also provide direct and indirect employment opportunities for around 50,000 skilled and semi-skilled labourers over the next two years. Currently, around 2-lakh workers are employed in the telecom manufacturing segment.

 ?A major part of the revenue will come from investments made by Nokia, Ericsson, LG and Elcoteq. It is estimated that around $800 million FDI will flow in for telecom equipment and handset manufacturing,? said N. K. Goyal, president of the Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association.

 Ericsson is expected to start delivery by the end of the month, while Elcoteq will go on stream by mid-April. LG and Nokia have both announced investments in GSM handset manufacturing.

 ?The correction of the inverted duty structure also provides a level-playing field for both imports and domestic manufacturers and increases their chances of growth. We expect the industry to generate Rs 25,000 crore for the next financial year,? Goyal said.

 ?Major investments will be made not only in GSM handset manufacturing but also WiFi and 3G network equipment,? he added. ?The manufacturing sector will no longer be limited to traditional equipment and a lot of investments will go into the implementation of new technologies.? He is enthusiastic that the budget proposals for 2005-06 will help small and medium players grow.

 ?The manufacturing competitiveness programme and the skill development initiative will help the SME segment to cope with bigger players. However, we do not expect to see new players in the SME segment as new technologies will require major investments that will be beyond their capacity,? he said.

 Centurion back in black

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Talwar: Big strides

 Mumbai, May 19: The new management at the helm of the Mumbai-based Centurion Bank has brought the bank back into the black by successfully solving the legacy issues that led it slip into the red.

 The private sector bank has posted a net profit of Rs 9.60 crore for the fourth quarter of 2004-05 against a loss of Rs 97.72 crore in the year-ago period.

 For the year ended March 31, the bank?s net profit stood at Rs 25.11 crore compared with a loss of Rs 105.14 crore in 2003-04. The net interest margin of the bank has also improved to 5.8 per cent from 4.6 per cent in 2003-04.

 After its recent global depository receipts (GDR) issue and the exercise of the greenshoe option (wherein the bank retained the oversubscription to the extent of 100 per cent of the issue size), its capital adequacy ratio improved to 23.1 per cent. 

 The bank?s net non-performing assets (NPA) have come down to 2.5 per cent from 4.3 per cent in the previous year on the back of a balance sheet clean-up.

 At the end of March, its net NPA stood lower at Rs 55 crore primarily because of recoveries from 82 non-performing accounts. 

 Moreover, the bank had also been able to bring down its treasury maturities ahead of the decline in bond prices and its marked-to-market treasury book stood at an average duration of 0.4 years as on March 31. 

 This apart, retail and corporate credit functions were strengthened and prudent provisioning policies put in place.

 The bank has the highest proportion of retail advances, which form 80 per cent of its total advances. 

 During the last fiscal, Centurion Bank started offering home and personal loans and wealth management services, including the distribution of life insurance policies of Bajaj Allianz and other investment products. 

 The bank has strenghtened its retail franchise network and commissioned 14 new branches during the year, taking the total number of branches and extension counters to 99 across 60 cities. 

 In 2004-05, the bank?s retail assets increased 69 per cent to Rs 2,107 crore (pre-securitisation) from Rs 1,245 crore in the previous year. Total deposits during the period increased 17 per cent to Rs 3,530 crore from Rs 3,029 crore.

 ?Last fiscal has been a landmark year for Centurion Bank. In the tenth year of operations, we have resolved all the major legacy issues and made significant strides to develop our retail franchise, build up our management teams at different levels, expand multiple distribution channels and put in place building blocks to improve productivity,? chairman Rana Talwar said.

 PEMA LEYDA SHANGDERPA

 Chidambaram: Charmed

 Namchi (south Sikkim) May 14: Sikkim chief minister Pawan Chamling?s efforts to woo private investors to the state bore fruit today when Swiss conglomerate SICPA ? the first multinational group to enter the state ? started commercial production.

 Union finance minister P. Chidambaram inaugurated SICPA?s second security ink producing unit in the country at Mamring in south Sikkim.

 Chidambaram praised the state government?s initiative. ?I have watched Sikkim under the stewardship of Chamling and I must say I am highly impressed,? he said.

 Speaking on the occasion, Chamling said it was an important day in Sikkim?s industrial history. 

 On Chamling?s request for Rs 1,000 crore as ?peace bonus? for the state, Chidambaram did not give any assurance. However, he said Sikkim will continue to occupy a special place in the central government?s scheme of things.

 Chamling said Sikkim deserved to get the ?peace bonus? from the Centre as it remained peaceful despite insurgency in some of its neighbours.

 The plant at Mamring has been built at a cost of Rs 50 crore and will generate enough employment opportunities for locals, Sudhir Jain, chairman of SICPA India, said.

 The SICPA group, a Swiss company with 40 security ink plants in 38 countries, is the global leader in producing ?Yecuritx? inks for bank notes and value documents.

 The state-of-the-art unit equipped with the latest technology will manufacture security inks used for printing bank currency notes, stamps and other security documents.

 SICPAs first unit is in Bhiwadi, Rajasthan.The group operates in over 35 countries.

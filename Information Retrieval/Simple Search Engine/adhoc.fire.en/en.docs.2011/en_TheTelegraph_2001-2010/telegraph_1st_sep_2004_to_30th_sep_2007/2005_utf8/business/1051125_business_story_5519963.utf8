 RBI gives banks super-fit certificate

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Thumbs up

 Mumbai, Nov. 24: Banks have been able to ride over the hump created by the upturn in the interest rate cycle.

 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) said this really underscores just how robust and resilient the Indian financial system really is. Despite the odd wobble sparked by the falling rupee, rise in crude oil prices and the marginal slowdown in deposit growth, banks have come through extremely well this year.

 The big visible trend this year has been the sharp rise in bank credit: scheduled commercial banks? credit swelled by 14.2 per cent up to September 30 against 11.7 per cent in the corresponding period a year ago. 

 But that?s not all: from a systemic point of view, the banking system has made significant progress in improving its financial and soundness indicators such as profitability, asset quality and capital position.

 Moreover, the return on assets is around 1 per cent, which is comparable with international levels.

 There are other positive features in the financial system. While the difference between gross and non-performing loans have narrowed, reflecting the improved recovery management by the banking sector, despite the poor health of some of the co-operative banks, ?the financial system, on the whole has become resilient?.

 In its report on ?Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2004-05?, which was released here today, the RBI said the banks no longer tend to rely on robust deposit growth to be able to meet the rising demand for credit. According to the central bank, some changes have occurred on the liability side of banks? balancesheet. 

 Though deposits continue to be the main source of funding, the relative significance of non-deposit resources has increased. In the latter, the share of borrowings has increased. The two significant sources of borrowings have been subordinated debt, issued to augment Tier II capital and increase in foreign currency borrowings. 

 Sensitising banks about the forthcoming risks, the central bank averred that major ones are from credit and market. As loans and advances constitute the bulk of the assets in the banking system, credit will remain the primary source of risk. Though the RBI expects credit risk environment to be favourable in the near-term as macroeconomic fundamentals of the economy are robust, it cautioned banks that in the event of a sharp rise in interest rate, they may suffer significant marked to market losses on their investment portfolio.

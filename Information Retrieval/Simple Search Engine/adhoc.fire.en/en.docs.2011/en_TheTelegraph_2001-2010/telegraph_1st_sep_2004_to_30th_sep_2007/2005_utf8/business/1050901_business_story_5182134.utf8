 Calcutta, Aug. 31: Indian Overseas Bank has asked the Reserve Bank to allow it to hold on to its 30 per cent stake in Bharat Overseas Bank.

 The recent RBI circular barring banks or financial institutions from holding more than 5 per cent in a corporate body has prompted Indian Overseas Bank?s move. ?We have written to the RBI to exempt us from the clause,? chairman and managing director T.S. Narayanasami said. 

 ?We have been historically holding 30 per cent in Bharat Overseas. It is not for voting rights or anything else,? executive director A.R. Nagappan said.

 Apart from IOB, Bank of Rajasthan holds 16 per cent in Bharat Overseas, Vysya Bank has 14.66 per cent, Federal Bank owns 10.67 per cent, Karura Vysya Bank 10 per cent, South Indian Bank 10 per cent and the rest 8.67 per cent is held by Karnataka Bank.

 The bank today tied up with Tata Mutual Fund to sell the latter?s mutual find products. ?We have tie-ups with other mutual funds like LIC, National Insurance and others. We expect to earn a fee-based income of Rs 75 crore in the current financial year,? Narayanasami said.

 The bank hopes to do business worth Rs 86,000 crore ? Rs 33,000 crore credit and Rs 53,000 crore deposit ? in the current financial year. Last year, the bank had done business worth Rs 71,000 crore.

 The capital adequacy ratio of the bank is 14 per cent and it has no immediate plans to raise tier- I capital to dilute the government holding. The government holds 62 per cent in the bank.

 ?We plan to raise Rs 500 crore tier-II capital in the fourth quarter of this fiscal,? Narayanasami added.

 The bank has a net non-performing asset of 1 per cent and a gross NPA of 5 per cent.

 Tata Mutual Fund

 Tata Asset Management?s total asset under management has crossed the Rs 10,000-crore-mark, MD Ved Prakash Chaturvedi has said. ?We are now the sixth largest mutual fund in the country.?

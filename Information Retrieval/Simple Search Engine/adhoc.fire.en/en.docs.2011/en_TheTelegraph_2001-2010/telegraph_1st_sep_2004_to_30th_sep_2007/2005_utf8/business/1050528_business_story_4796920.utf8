 Haldia stake transfer talks hit a block

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Still a mirage

 Calcutta, May 27: The Bengal government could not reach a pact today on transferring its shares in Haldia Petrochemicals to Purnendu Chatterjees The Chatterjee Group (TCG).

 The sticking point in the negotiations, on for about a week, was the governments insistence that Purnendu fork out Rs 1,560 crore for acquiring its 36 per cent stake up-front.

 Till late tonight, TCG was not able to say when it would be able to stump up the cash that the government said should be paid in a single instalment. The government wanted a definite timeframe within which the funds would be brought in, though there were indications that it could allow a two-month window for it.

 Purnendu, who owns 43 per cent of Haldia Petrochem (HPL), is believed to have told the government that he needs Reserve Bank permission if he decides to get foreign cash.

 Another point that the government raised was related to pledging of lenders share in HPL to raise money that Purnendu needs to acquire Basell Polyolefins. A TCG-led consortium bagged the Dutch petreochem giant in a $5.7-billion deal a couple of weeks back.

 A portion of the lenders debt was converted into equity during HPLs corporate debt restructuring exercise. Sources say the state government has asked Purnendu to get permission from lenders if their equity is to be pledged to raise loans needed to close the Basell deal.

 Industry watchers say Purnendu is also unhappy over the pricing of HPL shares. He has questioned the logic of giving away shares at Rs 10 to Indian Oil at a time when he is being asked to pay Rs 30 ? a premium of Rs 20.

 Sources say these issues will be discussed at HPLs Saturday meeting. Purnendu is also scheduled to meet state government representatives and lenders.

 We are yet to come to an agreement on the issue. If both sides agree on the terms and conditions, a deal will be reached under the terms of the inter-promoter agreement, state commerce and industry minister told reporters at the Writers Buildings today.

 Asked what the stumbling blocks to the HPL share transfer were, Sen said such details could not be shared. 

 On the issue of HPL joining the TCG-led consortium in financing the Basell acquisition, the minister said the government would present its view at Saturdays meeting.

 Once Purnendu, one of the principal promoters, buys out the governments share, he will be in a position to make HPL invest in Basell. The government, as a majority shareholder in HPL, is not keen on HPL investing in Basell.

 SEZ bill tabled in Lok Sabha

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 9: The government today introduced in the Lok Sabha the special economic zone (SEZ) bill that seeks to provide a 15-year tax holiday and single-window clearance mechanism for the creation of export promotion zones.

 The umbrella legislation, which was cleared by the Union cabinet last week, provides fiscal concessions to both the developers of the zones as well as the export units set up in these zones. 

 It also lays down the legislative framework for setting up offshore banking units to facilitate export transactions.

 The 56-page SEZ bill seeks to establish a single enforcement agency to ensure speedy trial and investigation of notified offences committed in such zones.

 According to the provisions of the bill, SEZ units will be eligible for 100 per cent tax exemption for five years, 50 per cent for the next five years while 50 per cent of the ploughed back export profits for the next five years will also be exempt from tax. 

 The developers of the zones will continue to get 100 per cent income tax exemption for 10 years in a block period of 15 years.

 The bill aims to encourage state governments to liberalise state laws and delegate their powers to the development commissioners of the SEZs to facilitate single-window clearance.

 India already has 11 functioning SEZs. Of these, seven have been set up by the central government and four through joint ventures and state governments. In addition, approvals have been given for 35 new SEZs to private entrepreneurs and state governments.

 The 11 SEZs are functioning in Salt Lake and Falta, Kandla, Surat, Cochin, Santa Cruz, Chennai, Vishakhapatnam, Noida, Indore, and Jaipur. Two more at Jodhpur and Moradabad are ready for operations. Other SEZs are at various stages of implementation.

 The SEZs have been modelled on the Chinese pattern but have failed to take off as yet. Despite the major policy thrust in their favour, the SEZs of the country have managed to increase their share in the total export basket by a mere 0.5 per cent to touch 5.26 per cent during April 2004 to January 2005 from 4.72 per cent during 2003-04.

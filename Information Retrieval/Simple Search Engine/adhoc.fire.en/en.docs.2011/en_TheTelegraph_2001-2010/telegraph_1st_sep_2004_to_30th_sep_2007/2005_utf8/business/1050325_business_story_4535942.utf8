 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 24: ?The owners of raw materials will be the kings of the industry,? said Tata Steel chairman Ratan Tata. 

 Those in control of the raw material will not only be ?competitive? but also ?self sufficient? than those without iron ore and coal mines, said Tata, who sits at the head of the country?s largest private sector steel firm.

 His comment comes days after managing director B. Muthuraman, said companies like Tata Steel will do well. Tata Steel has a fully integrated operation. The company?s strategy of owning coal and ore mines will work in its favour, Muthuraman had said.

 Tata, for the first time, spoke about L. N. Mittal, the Indian entrepreneur who has made huge strides abroad in the steel industry. When a shareholder quizzed him, he simply said his (Mittals) style has been to turn around companies. Ours has been a different style altogether?. 

 Bangladesh projects

 A feasibility study for the Bangladesh project will be completed by April. ?Well make a decision after we take our proposals to the Bangladesh government. 

 Then issues like commitment on the supply of gas by the Bangladesh government will be sorted out before we take a decision, he added. Tata said Bangladesh has a good track-record on honouring power-purchase agreements.

 Ludhiana, Sept. 22: Taking technological convergence a step forward, Bharti Teletech ? a manufacturer of fixed-line phones ? will soon come out with products that are compatible with the subscriber identification module (SIM) card of cellular phones. Such a product is currently not available in the country.

 ?We will launch fixed-line phones by November, which can read the memory from the cellular SIM card and store it in the fixed-line phone,? said Rakesh Bharti Mittal, vice-chairman and managing director of Bharti Teletech.

 The new phone will be available in the retail market by the year-end. 

 Bharti will launch another fixed phone with a backlit feature similar to mobile phones next month. It will be sold in the retail market as well as through Bharat Sanchar Nigam and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam. 

 Speaking on the occasion of producing one million phones at its Ludhiana facility, Mittal said, ?The feat has been completed within a period of five months and three days.? 

 The plant manufactures telephone instruments under Bharti?s own brand, Beetel, as well as for GE. Bharti has set a target to produce another million phones by January. 

 Mittal said the company?s manufacturing facilities in Goa and Ludhiana will also manufacture fixed wireless terminals and fixed wireless phones based on the global system of mobile communications (GSM) technology. 

 The company will also launch a 2.4 giga hertz fixed wireless phone that will remove problems of voice in range and disturbances. This will be manufactured in China and assembled at the two factories. In the first phase, the company will import 12,000 phones and 20,000 in the second phase. 

 Bharti will invest $1 million for manufacturing and R amp;D in 2005-06. Post investment, the Ludhiana factory will have an annual production capacity of 3.5 million phones annually, in addition to 3 million units from the Goa facility.

 Bharti Teletech has a production capacity of 3 million phones, houses a calibration and reliability lab and an incoming component control lab. 

 Bharti?s sales grew 32 per cent at 5.1 million units during 2004-05, while revenue rose 55 per cent at Rs 212 crore.

 Beetel has a 40 per cent share in the retail market, 95 per cent in the private service providers? market and 58 per cent in the BSNL-MTNL market.

 The Beetel phones are sold by more than 240 distributors and 10,370 dealers across the country. 

 Bharti Teletech has a wide portfolio of more than 35 models of phones with prices ranging between Rs 295 and Rs 4,995.

 The company plans to mop up Rs 69 crore through the issue, which will be used for the financial and organisational restructuring initiated by the company. The company has suffered a net loss of Rs 62.75 crore in 2004.

 Bata India plans to increase its authorised share capital to Rs 70 crore and allot about 1.28 crore additional shares under a rights issue.

 Bata?s price represents a discount of nearly 42 per cent at which it is being traded on the bourses. The current share price is hovering around Rs 94.

Private corporate bodies and NRIs/OCBs hold the rest in the company.

 The rights issue committee, at a meeting held on April 9, had fixed the issue price at Rs 54 apiece, including the face value of Rs 10, the company has informed the BSE.

 Shares under the rights issue would be distributed in the ratio of 1:4, which means that one share will be issued for every four held by shareholders whose name appear on the register of members or on the list of depositories as beneficial owners.

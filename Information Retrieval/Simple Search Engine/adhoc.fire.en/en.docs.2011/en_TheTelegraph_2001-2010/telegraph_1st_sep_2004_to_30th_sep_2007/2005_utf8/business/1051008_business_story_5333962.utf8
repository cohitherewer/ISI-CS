 New Delhi, Oct. 7: Union minister for agriculture Sharad Pawar today ruled out the possibility of importing sugar, saying domestic production in the current year would be enough to meet the countrys requirements.

 No sugar imports will be needed this year as sugar production is expected to be more than the required amount, he said on the sidelines of a rural marketing summit organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 Besides, sugar imports will not be economical as international prices are ruling very high, he added.

 Last year, the country had to import about 2 million tonnes of the commodity to meet domestic demand following a shortfall in sugarcane production.

 This year, however, sugarcane output is estimated at 18-18.5 million tonnes, up 5-5.5 million tonnes from last year.

 In addition, the minister indicated there would be no need to import wheat, too, as the buffer stock of the foodgrain this year was at a comfortable level. There is no cause of concern as the situation is comfortable, he added.

 He said the government has constituted a high-level panel to draw up a detailed five-year plan for reforms in the agriculture and allied sectors. The committee will suggest calibrated measures to empower rural India and raise the purchasing power of the farming community.

 The minister pointed out that the industry and the private sector could play a major role in providing extension services to the farmers and develop business models. This would help support marketing the farm produce and ensure quality products for consumers under a remunerative price regime.

 According to Pawar, serious constraints continue to impede the agriculture sector.

 While productivity levels for most foodgrain crops in India are way below their world averages, there are signs that the yields of major crops in most regions are hitting a plateau, he said.

 Currency pressure mounts on China

 Beijing, Feb. 21 (Reuters): Britain?s finance minister on Monday urged cooperation between the world?s rich nations and China and is expected later to say it would be futile to resort to protectionism to counter China?s growing economic might. 

 China came under pressure at a G7 meeting earlier this month in London to allow its tightly managed currency to appreciate against the dollar to help address global economic imbalances.

 ?I believe we can make enormous progress addressing some of the challenges facing the global economy in the coming year,? Gordon Brown said at the start of a meeting with Chinese finance minister Jin Renqing. 

 Brown is scheduled to meet senior Chinese officials, including Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and central bank chief Zhou Xiaochuan, on what is his first visit to China. 

 He is expected in a speech later to urge that advanced industrialised nations cooperate with China because of its growing role in the world?s financial system, British Treasury officials said. 

 ?I am also pleased that our two countries have the presidency of the G7 and G20 this year and so we can strengthen our bilateral cooperation,? Jin said. 

 Britain is the current chair of the G7 while China is the chair of the G20 developing nations. A joint G7-G20 statement would be issued later on Monday, Brown said.

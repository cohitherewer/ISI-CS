 Duty-free fuel import sop for Dabhol

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept 9: The government will allow duty-free import of liquefied natural gas (LNG) as part of the fiscal concession package to revive the mothballed Dabhol power project by June 2006. 

 The empowered group of ministers, headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, had decided on Thursday to grant mega power project status to Dabhol plant, which will enable the NTPC-Gail combine to import capital equipment duty free for phase II of the project. 

 Capital gains tax has also been waived on transfer of assets from Dabhol Power Co to Ratnagiri Gas and Power, the special purpose vehicle floated by NTPC and Gail for the project. According to senior officials, the government will waive the 5 per cent customs duty on the 2.1-million tonne LNG that Gail intends to import for the 2,184-mw power plant. This will reduce the cost of fuel.

 Gail is expecting LNG at $3.30-3.40 per million British thermal unit in order to generate power at Rs 2.30 per unit.

 The duty free import of capital equipment for the 1,444-mw phase-II of the project and LNG facilities will also minimise investments.

 If Gail and NTPC make investments in excess of $200 million for setting up LNG facilities and the power plant, the excess expenditure would be bankrolled by institutional lenders.

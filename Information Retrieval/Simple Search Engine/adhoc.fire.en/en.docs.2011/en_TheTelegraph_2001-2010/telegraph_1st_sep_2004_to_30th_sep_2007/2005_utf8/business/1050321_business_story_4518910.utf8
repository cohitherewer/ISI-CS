 Sunny days for the retired 

 To make the post-retirement years 

 the best ones in your life, Birla Sun Life Insurance is 

 offering Flexi SecureLife II Retirement Plan. The plan has 

 two options ? single premium and regular premium. The unit-linked 

 plan is designed in two phases ? accumulation and annuity.

 In the accumulation phase, the minimum amount one can deposit is Rs 50,000 under the single premium plan and Rs 5,000 under regular premium option. However, one can top up the fund with a minimum of Rs 10,000.

 There are three investment options to choose from during the accumulation phase ? nourish, growth and enrich. The valuation of each fund is done on a unitised basis.

 The policy fund value is calculated as the number of units in the investment fund allotted to the policyholder multiplied by the unit price of the investment fund. It also provides the flexibility of allocating the premium amount in different proportions into the various fund options.

 The minimum entry age is 18 years, while the maximum is 65. One can choose the vesting age between 50 and 70, subject to a minimum tenure of five years for single premium and 10 years for regular premium plans.

 One can opt for a life insurance cover till the vesting age; the minimum face amount is Rs 55,000 under single premium (110 per cent of the premium) and Rs 50,000 under regular premium (10 times the premium). 

 In case of death, the benefit will be higher of the policy fund or the life insurance coverage amount. 

 On the date of vesting, one has two options ? withdraw one third of the fund as a lumpsum and utilise the remaining portion to purchase an annuity from Birla Sun Life or any other annuity provider at the then prevailing rates. You can also utilise the entire policy fund to buy the annuity.

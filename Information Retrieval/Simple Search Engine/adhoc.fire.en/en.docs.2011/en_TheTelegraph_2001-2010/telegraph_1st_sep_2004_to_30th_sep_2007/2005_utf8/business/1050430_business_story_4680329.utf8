 Showdown glare on Reliance

 LAHIRI: ALERTOUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lahiri: Alert

 Mumbai, April 29: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today discussed issues thrown up by the raging dispute between Ambani brothers at the Reliance group.

 The Sebi board met here today, and on top of its agenda was Anil Ambani?s recent letter to the regulator requesting investigations into corporate governance and transparency issues within the Reliance group.

 Sebi chairman M. Damodaran remained silent on the matter. However, Ashok Lahiri, economic adviser to the finance minister and a Sebi board member, said the market regulator was keeping a close eye on developments in the Reliance group. It would initiate action at the appropriate time.

 ?Sebi keeps everything under surveillance,? Lahiri told newspersons. ?If anything comes up in the surveillance, it will look into the matter.?

 The Sebi board discussed two issues concerning the Reliance group. The first related to Reliance Industries (RIL) vice-chairman Anil Ambani?s refusal to sign the accounts of the company and his questions on corporate governance.

 The other issue was whether the takeover code would apply to the recent acquisition of Reliance Capital?s indirect stake in IPCL by two unlisted Reliance group companies. Reliance Capital held a 50 per cent stake in Reliance Petroinvest Ltd, which, in turn, held 46 per cent in IPCL. 

 A Sebi spokesperson declined to comment on the issue. 

 Last December, Anil Ambani had penned a 500-page tome listing breach of corporate governance practices within the group, a copy of which had been sent to the regulator. 

 The RIL management, headed by elder brother Mukesh Ambani, had set up a three-member committee on corporate governance led by Y. P. Trivedi. It consisted of RIL independent directors. The committee gave a clean chit to Mukesh, clearing him of all charges levelled by Anil.

 Meanwhile, the Anil-controlled Reliance Energy today informed parent Reliance Industries that it had submitted its audited accounts for 2004-05 on April 14.

 REL was responding to a letter sent on April 27 by RIL company secretary Vinod Ambani.

 RIL officials said they had received the reply but did not give the details of the letter. 

 Meanwhile, RIL will tap the international debt market for a fresh five-year $250 million multi-currency syndicated loan facility.

 Robust growth

 New Delhi, Feb. 25: India is ready for the ?big push? in investments as the growing interest of foreign investors coincides with the rising confidence of domestic private investors.

 The Economic Survey 2005-06 tabled in Parliament highlights the 8.9 per cent growth achieved during the first nine months of 2004-05. It has stressed the need to remove constraints like infrastructure bottlenecks and shortages, labour market rigidities, entry and exit barriers and land acquisition and multiple stages and levels of approvals/clearances. 

 The survey also stresses the need for improved Centre-state interface for better co-ordination. This will further brighten the outlook for industrial growth. 

 The present trends indicate a positive outlook for industrial growth because of improved capacity utilisation, industrial climate, expanding external and domestic demand and ease in availability of credit, states the survey.

 Acknowledging that infrastructure and procedural bottlenecks are major growth hurdles, the survey has warned that the investment in the economy was much below neighbouring China and East Asia. It has cast doubts about attaining 10 per cent industrial growth envisaged in the Tenth Plan.

 Commending the policy initiatives for industry, the survey says reforms and sound economic fundamentals are the pillars of strength of growth that would boost investment in the sector.

 ?The strength and robustness of industrial growth in the current fiscal despite shocks like Tsunami, deficient monsoon and a third oil shock, is not just a matter of good fortune but also a response to the reforms and manifestation of the sound fundamentals of the economy,? the survey said.

 The increasing efficiency and competitiveness of domestic producers, liberalised trade and a deregulated interest rate regime are critical contributors to both growth and acceleration and macro-economic stability.

 A dramatic decline in interest rates and a significant turnaround in public investment through the infrastructure development programme have been two critical drivers of the recovery. The survey has pointed out that the low interest rates fuelled the housing, automobiles and consumer durables sectors that were instrumental in accelerating industrial growth.

 ?Although the momentum in these sectors has slowed down, they still continue to provide necessary support to the process of industrial growth,? states the survey.

Automobiles

 The survey has projected higher growth potential in the automobile component due to outsourcing activities by global majors. Terming it as a sunrise sector, the survey highlighted that the automobile component sector posted a significant 20 per cent growth in 2003-04 to achieve a sales turnover of Rs 30,640 crore.

Textiles

 The Survey has taken into account the phasing out of the quota regime from early this year in the textile sector while highlighting that there it has impacted the sector. The evidence of substantial improvement in the performance is sketchy. However, there are signs of resurgence in the textile sector with production of fabrics raising by 4.8 per cent in April-November 2004.

Electronics and IT

 The IT industry continued its growth trend. The highlight was the growth in sales of hardware with decline in prices of computers and electronic items. 

Steel

 The steel sector also grew positively registering a growth of 4 per cent during the April-December period in 2004-05. However, the survey has recommended a substantial improvement in port storage and haulage facilities. Additionally, good rail and road networks are needed for movement of raw and finished steel.

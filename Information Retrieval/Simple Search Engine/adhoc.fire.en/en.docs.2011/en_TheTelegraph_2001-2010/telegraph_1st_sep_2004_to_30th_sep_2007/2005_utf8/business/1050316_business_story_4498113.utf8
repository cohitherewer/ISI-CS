 Budget comes under fire

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 15: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) today attacked the Congress-led government for presenting an ?anti-poor, anti-women and anti-senior citizens? budget.

 BJP leader Vijay Kumar Malhotra, who kicked off the debate, claimed that the budget was a mere jugglery of statistics.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram had claimed that senior citizens with income of up to Rs 1,50,000 were exempted from tax. However, this had been allowed last year itself, he added. 

 The actual tax concessions had come down as senior citizens had lost out on standard deductions, which was abolished from this year onwards. 

 Malhotra said similarly, women did not stand to benefit much from the announced tax exemption of up to an income of Rs 1,20,000.

 The common man too had been hit by the cess of 50 paise on diesel and petrol and an increase in excise duties on steel, making construction of houses and steel appliances costlier.

 He also attacked the widening of the service tax net, which he said would make ?everything costlier?.

 The BJP leader also dubbed the budget ?anti-farmer?. He said the claim of giving 30 per cent more credit to farmers was meaningless as they are unable to repay past debt. 

 ?What they actually needed was remunerative price for their farm produce, which will enable them to repay their loans,? he added. He also picked holes in the governments promise to operationalise the Employment Guarantee Scheme, stating it had been delaying passing a legislation guaranteeing jobs to the poor besides providing the scheme with inadequate resources.

 Malhotra demanded setting up of a sixth pay commission for government employees as the last pay commission report came out in 1996 and a fresh report was overdue.

 RAJA GHOSHAL

 New Delhi, Feb. 3: Dabur India Ltd (DIL) is seeking shareholder approval for its recent acquisition of Balsara Hygiene and Home Products business for Rs 143 crore in an all-cash deal. The company sent out postal ballots for shareholder ratification of the deal.

 The postal ballots have been sent out to 50,000 shareholders of Dabur India and the process is expected to be completed before April.

 A team of senior Dabur officials, led by chief executive officer Sunil Duggal, has gone to the Balsara headquarters in Mumbai to evaluate the scope of leveraging the seven brands that it has acquired.

 Once the shareholders approve the deal, the company will decide on the amalgamation and positioning of the Balsara brands within the Dabur portfolio. 

 Last Thursday, Dabur India had announced the acquisition of the Balsara group of companies for Rs 143 crore in an all-cash deal. The deal includes the acquisition of three companies and seven brands of Balsara. These brands are three oral-care brands Promise, Babool and Meswak. The other brands include mosquito repellent and home-care products like Odopic and Sani Fresh.

 The Babool brand belongs to Besta Cosmetics, while the others are with Balsara Hygiene Products. The third company called Balsara Home Products owns the three manufacturing facilities of Balsara at Silvassa, Kanpur and Baddi.

 Company sources said the team of senior officials has gone to the Balsara headquarters for the ?first round of meeting? after the acquisition. Sources say the company will work out a roadmap for the possible changes in the positioning of the brands, and for an effective amalgamation and marketing plan for these brands from the Dabur platform.

 LOOSE CHANGE

 Chola MS General Insurance has unveiled an overseas travel insurance product. The plan covers adventure sports like bungee jumping, para-sailing, para-gliding, deep-sea walk and trekking. It also covers personal accident from residence to international airport and back. The plan offers a cover for cruise and one-way immigration travel. The policy follows a ?per day? pricing model and offers cashless settlement of hospitalisation claims abroad. 

 The Series II of Birla Fixed Term Debt Fund, a closed-ended income scheme with 18-month and 36-month plans, will remain open between June 2 and June 17. It would invest 85-100 per cent of its assets in debt securities and 15-30 per cent in money market instruments. The minimum investment amount is Rs 5,000 and though there is no entry load, there is variable exit load.

 Pru ICICI Mutual Fund has altered the exit load structure of Pru ICICI Long Term Floating Rate Fund. Under Option-A of the plan, an exit load of 0.50 per cent will now be levied for redemption of less than Rs 1 crore within six months of allotment. Any redemption after six months or above Rs 1 crore would be free from any exit load.

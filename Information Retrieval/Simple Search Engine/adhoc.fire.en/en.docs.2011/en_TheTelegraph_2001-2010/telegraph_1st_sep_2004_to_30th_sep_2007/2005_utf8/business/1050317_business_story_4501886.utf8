 Move to link mill recast to jute bag order

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 16: Modernisation of jute mills will soon become a pre-requisite for purchase of B. Twill bags by the government to pack food grains.

 The process for working out the modernisation status of the mills has already started. Quotas are likely to be fixed from the kharif procurement season.

 Food Corporation of India and various government agencies made food grains procurement purchase upward of 9 lakh tonnes of B. Twill bags for packing rice and wheat. Orders for about 4.5 lakh tonnes are likely to be placed for kharif procurement beginning in May.

 The decision to purchase bags only from mills, which had undertaken modernisation programme, would force the mill owners to take up upgradation seriously, according to jute commissioner S. Majumdar.

 The process for the new purchase plans on the basis of modernisation has already started. Jute mill owners, willing to participate in the government purchase, would have to submit audit report on the status of their factories by April. On the basis of the status report, the government would fix quota for the respective mills.

 Majumdar, who was speaking at a seminar on industrial relations in the industry, said details of the new purchase policy linked to mill modernisation was being worked out.

 He said there were various government-sponsored funding schemes for modernisation. While the 15 per cent subsidy scheme of the Jute Manufactures Development Council (JMDC) for diversified products would continue, the Jute Technology Million?s capital subsidy scheme should be operational from May.

 Majumdar said the technology mission fund had been scaled down from Rs 465 crore to Rs 325 crore and mill owners willing to modernise their establishments would get 15 per cent capital subsidy under the new scheme.

 Md Amin, Bengal labour minister, said funds were not a constraint for the industry to take up modernisation. The industry could even obtain funds from banks for giving superannuation benefits.

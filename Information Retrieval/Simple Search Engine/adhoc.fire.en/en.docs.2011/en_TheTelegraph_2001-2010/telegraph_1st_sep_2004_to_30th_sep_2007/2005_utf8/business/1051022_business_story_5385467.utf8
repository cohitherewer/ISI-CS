 Calcutta, Oct. 21: Its raining FDI in Bengal. After Indonesias Salim Group sealed its two-wheeler project on Thursday, Taiwanese auto major Kwang Yang has put the state on its course.

 The largest two-wheeler company in the island nation could invest up to $20 million, or around Rs 90 crore, in the venture.

 Thomas Chang, director of Taipei World Trade Centre, said the company had listed Bengal as one of the options for its manufacturing unit. Pune, Chennai and Orissa are also vying to bag the project.

 The company, known as Kymco, was incorporated in 1960s. It has three plants in Taiwan, four in China and one in Indonesia. It also manufactures auto spares.

 If Bengal finally breasts the tape, it could be the third big-ticket investment in the states automobile sector. Besides the Salim Groups Rs 250 crore plant in Uluberia, Ural of Russia plans an assembly plant for heavy-duty trucks. These are the first big projects in the past 50 years since Hindustan Motors set up a unit in Hooghly.

 Auto analysts feel once an ancillary industry grows in the state ? Chennai is held up as an example ? Bengal would be able to draw more investments to the sector. Two-wheeler makers are making a beeline because India, the second-largest market for their products, is expected to notch up sales of six million this year. The market is now heavily skewed in favour of motor bikes, which has made Hero Honda the leader, followed by Bajaj and TVS.

 Ore hunt

 Chang said a Taiwanese company would set up base in Calcutta to source iron ore. Speaking at the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today, he said Taiwan, with the worlds third-largest foreign exchange reserves of $292 billion, is looking to step up investments in India.

 Taiwanese FDI in India at $200 million is poised for a leap. Bilateral trade between the two nations, pegged at $2.2 billion in the year to July, will rise to $2.5 billion, he added.

 Call for cut in textile duty

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 16: Following the elimination of the quota regime earlier this month, global trade in textiles is likely to grow at about 5 per cent in the coming years to reach $600 billion by 2010, says the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 Considering the huge availability of raw material, low labour cost and growing market for textile products, the sector has a high potential for growth.

 In terms of value of production, exports, employment and contribution to the exchequer, textiles is one of the leading sectors of the world economy.

 In the 2004 budget, the government had completely revised the excise duty structure on textiles. At present, the mandatory excise duty is 24 per cent on polyester filament yarn and 16 per cent on all other manmade filament fibres as well as yarn.

 The CII says, ?The focus of the 2005 Budget should be to further strengthen the fiscal policy support for rejuvenation of the Indian textile industry.?

 The chamber has suggested that excise duty on polyester filament yarn should be reduced from 24 per cent to 16 per cent and on other manmade filament fibres and yarns from 16 per cent to 8 per cent.

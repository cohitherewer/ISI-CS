 Strategy to boost tax revenues

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chidambaram: On target

 New Delhi, July 6: The Union government, in its bid to shore up revenues, has asked the income tax department to concentrate on the top 100 tax payers in each commissionerate.

 Addressing tax commissioners here today, finance minister P. Chidambaram said they should also check on the double taxation avoidance treaties with other countries as many industry houses tend to use these as tax shelters.

 The minister asked the taxmen to work out strategies to increase tax collection to 5 per cent of the GDP.

 In 2005-06, the direct tax-GDP ratio is expected to cross 5 per cent, Chidambaram said. For the first time, direct taxes as a proportion of GDP crossed the 4-per-cent-mark in 2004-05. 

 The minister was confident that direct taxes would exceed indirect taxes ? customs and excise duties ? this year.

 These are important turning points in tax collections in India. Like in any other developed country, direct taxes will increasingly play a larger role, he said. So far, direct tax collections this year had been good.

 Chidambaram today kick-started a two-day annual meeting of chief commissioners of income tax where top taxmen would discuss ways to track large expenditures of high net worth individuals. The finance minister asked the commissioners to work out ways in order to bring more non-salaried individuals into the tax net. 

 The finance ministry has projected a 21 per cent growth in gross revenue collections during this fiscal ? a hard target to achieve, given the relatively lower growth rate of industry. 

 Officials, present at the meeting, said Chidambaram told them that methods of tax evasion are becoming ever more complex and sophisticated.

 Chidambaram also said the investigative methods being adopted must graduate from blunt instruments of search and seizure to sharper intelligent methods using information technology. 

 The finance minister emphasised the need to train income tax officials in international tax laws. 

 In the wake of increasing double taxation avoidance agreements with other countries, the minister said tax officials should have good understanding of tax laws of other countries in order to tackle those who were misusing the treaties to merely evade taxes.

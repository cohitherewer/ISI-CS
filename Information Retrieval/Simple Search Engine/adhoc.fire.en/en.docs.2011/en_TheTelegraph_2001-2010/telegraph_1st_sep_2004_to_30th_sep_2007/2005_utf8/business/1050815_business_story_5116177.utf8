 Kalam: The oil dream

 Dehradun, Aug. 14: President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam today urged the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) to enter the broader business of energy by tapping renewable sources rather than being confined to oil and gas exploration.

 ONGC should also produce bio-fuel and develop solar energy to cater to at least 50 per cent of the countrys oil and gas requirement, the President said at a function to celebrate the golden jubilee of the company.

 At present, ONGCs output meets only 26 per cent of the countrys oil needs.

 Kalam said the ever-increasing demand for energy in the country might not be possible to meet fully from conventional oil exploration and production.

 It appears to me that the only way to meet 50 per cent of the nations oil needs is to adopt the renewable energy route apart from further exploring deep sea oil resources and enhancing recovery from existing fields, he said.

 The President pointed out that the cost of bio-diesel extracted from the jatropha plant, which has been successfully grown on wastelands, works out to Rs 17 per litre. This can be further reduced by selecting high yielding varieties of the plant for 33 million hectares of wasteland in the country.

 Bio-diesel plants grown in 1 million hectares of land can yield a revenue of approximately Rs 2,000 crore a year and provide employment to over 1 million people both for plantation and running extraction plants, Kalam said.

 He also said it was essential to develop solar energy as a long-term solution to our problems. At present, solar cells have a 13-15 per cent efficiency. However, research efforts show that with the advent of polymer composite-based photovoltaic, the efficiency could increase to 50 per cent. This can pave the way for building 100-mw solar power stations in different parts of the country, he added.

 Kalam praised the ONGC community for tackling the blaze that broke out on the Mumbai High platform last month. All of you worked together to save precious lives with courage and team work, he said.

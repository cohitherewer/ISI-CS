 Rate-slash signal on calls to BSNL mobile 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Easy access

 New Delhi, June 9: Mobile calls made to a BSNL-CellOne subscriber from private operators could get cheaper.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today ordered BSNL to do away with the 19-paise transit charge that private operators have to pay to access CellOne subscribers.

 However, operators are not willing to comment on the cut in tariff yet and want more time to examine the order and its implementation by BSNL.

 At present, there is no direct connectivity between BSNLs cellular network and other private cellular companies. Traffic terminating in BSNLs CellOne network is routed through its fixed-line switch and charged at 19 paise per minute, said TDSAT in an order passed last month.

 In an order, the telecom tribunal had said that wherever the mobile switching centres of both CellOne and private cellular mobile operators are connected to the same BSNL switch, the transit charge should be removed. 

 Trais regulation is in compliance with TDSATs order of May 3 and comes with retrospective effect.

 In its order, TDSAT had said that on consideration of level playing field, we direct that BSNL should stop charging 19 paise from cellular operators by way of transit charges for accessing BSNL CellOne subscribers, wherever the MSCs of both CellOne and private cellular mobile service operators are connected to the same BSNL switch.

 We are of the view that our direction will take effect from the date of this judgment (May 3) and we authorise Trai to make this part of the regulatory regime, TDSAT said.

 India Inc happy with report card

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 25: India Inc has welcomed the emphasis on investment in agriculture, fillip to infrastructure sectors, boost to trade, higher resource mobilisation and public-private partnership in infrastructure development. 

 Acknowledging the economic reforms stated in the Economic Survey 2004-05, the industry said India needs investment in infrastructure for agriculture growth, FDI in retail, coal mining and insurance sectors and a regulatory framework for core industries in order to push the GDP growth rate.

 Onkar S. Kanwar, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), said, ?Reform of labour laws is heartening.? 

 The survey has noted that labour laws in competing economies like China and Latin American countries are much more aligned to the requirements of a globalised industry than Indian laws.

 ?The need for such reform has become imperative in view of the proposal for lowering duties to Asean levels,? he said.

 The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said the economy has moved to a new stage of rapid and sustained growth, he added.

 CII president Sunil Kant Munjal said the growth performance in 2004-05 is creditable due to high global oil and steel prices and the rather weak agriculture performance on account of deficient rainfall.

 ?Industrial sector growth at nearly 8 per cent and strong services sector performance at 8.9 per cent has helped to push up the overall economic growth despite agriculture output increasing only at 1.1 per cent,? he added.

 Explaining that FDI has been instrumental in imparting growth and improving consumer welfare, the industry said FDI cap should be raised in certain sectors, including insurance, coal mining and retail.

 Stressing on the need for continued macroeconomic stability, the CII said inflationary pressures have been contained in the economy without hiking interest rates using fiscal measures.

 ?This has helped avoid a rise in the cost of capital that could have choked off the investment growth,? said Munjal.

 Raising concerns about industrial growth being impacted by slower growth of infrastructure sector, K. N. Memani, president of PHDCCI, said, ?It calls for stepping up public investment in infrastructure.?

 He added issues like continued dependence on agriculture, a drop in foodgrain production, pick-up in inflation, strong rupee, anticipated hardening of interest rates and rising fuel or energy costs need to be dealt with adequately. 

 The survey laid stress on the need for subsidy rationalisation as it would free large amount of resources for productive investment and help in macro balancing.

 Munjal expressed concern on the continued deterioration of the fiscal balances as reflected in the high revenue deficit at the end of the third quarter.

 ?This needs urgent correction in light of the fiscal responsibility management act targets and for raising public investment levels in infrastructure, especially in irrigation and rural infrastructure,? he added.

 Ranjit Sen, national president, Indo-American Chamber of Commerce (IACC), said, ?Immediate steps have to be taken to pace up the agricultural growth in the country.?

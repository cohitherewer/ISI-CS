 Calcutta, Oct. 18: Buoyed by the popularity of Future Plus and the recently launched Jeevan Plus, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) expects its unit-linked products to contribute 40 per cent of its total first premium income for the current fiscal.

 In 2003-04, the share of the unit-linked products in all life insurance policies was around 8 per cent, which grew to 50 per cent in 2004-05. This year, the industry expects the contribution to be around 60 per cent, said G.N. Agarwal, chief (actuarial) and appointed actuary, LIC.

 The contribution of unit-linked products to LICs premium income rose from 4 per cent in 2003-04 to 35 per cent in 2004-05, said Agarwal. We expect it to go up to 40 per cent during the current fiscal, he added. After the withdrawal of Bima Plus, its first unit-linked product, LIC has launched Jeevan Plus, thereby maintaining two unit-linked products in its portfolio.

 LIC also plans to launch another 2-3 conventional products and has already filed the same with the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).

 For the half-year ended September 30, LIC has achieved a 62 per cent growth in its first premium income at Rs 5,620.88 crore against Rs 3,476.34 crore during the corresponding period last fiscal.

 In the number of policies, the corporation has recorded a growth of 17.7 per cent with 96.23 lakh policies against 81.76 lakh policies sold last year during the same period. In sum assured, there has been a 30 per cent jump to Rs 80,941.48 crore against Rs 62,414.45 crore.

 While the northern zone lead the pack with the highest first premium income at Rs 1,194.91 crore, the eastern zone sold the highest number of policies at 23.17 lakh.

 The high premium collection from the northern zone is due to the popularity of unit-linked plans, while the east has always preferred more conventional products, said Agarwal. In first premium income, the northern zone is followed by the southern zone at Rs 949.43 crore and the western zone with Rs 891.75 crore.

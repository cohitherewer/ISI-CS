 Hinduja TMT mulls stake sale in Hutch 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 15: Hinduja TMT is evaluating offers for its 3.5 per cent stake in Hutchison Max Telecom.

 ?The company has received offers from some financial and strategic investors to buy out its holding in Hutchison Max Telecom. The offers are being evaluated for maximising shareholder returns,? Hinduja TMT informed the Bombay Stock Exchange today.

 Following the consolidation of various Hutchison mobile telecom operations in India, Hinduja TMT, which had a holding in Fascel, through its subsidiary IndusInd Telecom Network, has received a 3.45 stake in the consolidated Hutch entity.

 The shareholders of Hutchison Max Telecom have previously indicated that they intend to seek a listing of the company by June 30, 2005. 

 Earlier this month, ahead of its planned initial public offering of shares, the Hutch-Essar combine folded its operations in 13 circles that are held together by six entities into one single outfit ? Hutchison Max Telecom (HMTL) ? the operator that owns the Mumbai circle licence.

 It was then announced that HMTL will eventually be renamed asHutchison Essar. ?The consolidated company will be better placed to access the debt and equity markets in India,? the company had said.

 Hutchison Telecom International, the main promoter, is owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shings Hutchison Whampoa Ltd. The other promoters are the Essar group, controlled by the Ruias, and Uday Kotaks Kotak Mahindra Group as financial investors.

 Mobile long distance rates cut

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 20: AirTel and Hutch today slashed its STD and ISD rates for mobile customers.

 ISD tariffs have been reduced by Rs 1.75 per minute and those of STD tariffs by 35 paise per minute. The cut in rates has been effected by reduction in access deficit charges (ADC) of 20 paise for calls between 50-200 kms and 50 paise per minute for those beyond 200 kms.

 The tariffs announced are radically lower than the existing rates and hence would further drive penetration of mobile telephony in the country. 

 The new rates are applicable with effect from February 1, 2005.

 The pre-paid users of both service providers would pay Rs 15.24 a minute to US, UK, Canada, Southeast Asia and the Saarc countries, while to West Asia, it will cost Rs 18.24 a minute.

 Announcing the new tariffs, Manoj Kohli, president (mobility), Bharti TeleVentures, said, ?This we believe will fuel new acquisitions and also spur usage increase. The AirTel customers will continue to enjoy special AirTel to AirTel STD tariffs at Rs 2 per minute.?

 The introduction of these tariffs is subject to the implementation of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India regulation announced on January 6.

 However, the reduced ISD tariffs would still be more than double of those offered by Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL).

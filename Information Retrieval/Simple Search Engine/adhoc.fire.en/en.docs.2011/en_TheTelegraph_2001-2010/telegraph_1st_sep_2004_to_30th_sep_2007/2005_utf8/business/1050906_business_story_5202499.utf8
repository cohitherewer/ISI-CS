 Julius Baer plans to buy three banks from rival

 Baer: Deal maker

 Zurich, Sept. 5 (Reuters): Julius Baer is to buy three small banks from rival UBS AG in a 5.6-billion Swiss franc deal aimed at creating a new force in Swiss finance, the worlds largest market for offshore private banking.

 Baer, the largest of Switzerlands mid-sized listed banks, said on Monday it would issue shares worth 2.45 billion francs to fund the purchase and that UBS would maintain a 21.5 per cent stake in the new group.

 The deal creates a new powerhouse in Switzerland, home to the worlds largest offshore banking industry, and aims to give growth-strapped Baer the mass it needs to weather a downturn among small and mid-sized wealth managers.

 Chairman Raymond Baer called the new group a third force in Switzerland after UBS, the worlds largest wealth manager with $1.99 trillion in assets, and Credit Suisse, with around $1.09 trillion in assets.

 The new group would rank third in Switzerland with assets under management of 270 billion Swiss francs.

 UBS executive Hans de Gier would become chief executive of the new group, which would adopt the Julius Baer name at other group members, such as the two-century old Geneva-based Ferrier-Lullin.

 The takeover represents the first big consolidation move among mid-sized Swiss players and could serve as an engine to take over more struggling banks in Switzerlands crowded wealth management market, de Gier said.

 We could become a very attractive platform for consolidation in Switzerland, he said, after integration efforts had been completed in around 18 months.

 There is an awful lot of consolidation to come, he added. Our brand ... and track record will hopefully attract a lot of people who realise at some point that they have to sell.

 The UBS units being sold, managed under a holding called SBC Wealth Management, were notable within the UBS group because they had remained semi-autonomous and independently branded.

 UBS will book a pretax capital gain of 3.5 billion francs from the deal, which allows it to focus on its banking activities that carry the UBS name.

 The new group will cut 350 jobs over the next two years, or 10 per cent of the workforce.

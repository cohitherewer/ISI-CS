 Modest rise in Coca-Cola net

 Good Show

 Atlanta, Feb. 16 (Reuters): Coca-Cola Co on Wednesday reported higher quarterly net income, boosted by the impact of currency changes, lower taxes and a late surge in demand for soft drinks, juices and other beverages.

 Shares of the worlds largest soft-drink maker, which has been struggling to boost sluggish sales, rose 2.6 per cent in trading before markets opened.

 ?We would expect the stock to react very positively, as no upside was expected,? said J. P. Morgan analyst John Faucher, who has an ?overweight? rating on Coke shares.

 Coca-Cola reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.2 billion, or 50 cents a share, compared with $927 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier.

 Excluding special items, profit was 46 cents a share, unchanged from the previous year. Revenue rose to $5.26 billion from $5.18 billion.

 Analysts on average had forecast Coca-Cola, which lowered its long-term earnings targets during the fourth quarter, would earn 40 cents per share on sales of $5.19 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Coca-Cola?s unit case volume, a key sales measure in the beverage industry, rose 2 per cent overall. Volume in North America, the company?s largest and most important market, was down 1 per cent in the period.

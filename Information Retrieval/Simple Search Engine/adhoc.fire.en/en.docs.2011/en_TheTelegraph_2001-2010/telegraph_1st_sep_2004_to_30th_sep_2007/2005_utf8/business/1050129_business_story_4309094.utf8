 Calcutta, Jan. 28 Saregama India Limited today announced a strategic alliance with MGM (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer) Studios to market modern Hollywood films in India.

 Saregama vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said the company would launch at least 100 MGM titles in the rapidly growing domestic video market next year.

 The tie-up gives Saregama access to MGM?s video library, which has the largest collection of film titles. It has 15 titles, which bagged the Oscar in the best film category.

 Saregama?s new alliance comes after similar tie-ups with other Hollywood majors like Universal Pictures, Warner Bros and Paramount, which have given the company almost a monopoly in the international films segment, he said, adding that this will also help Saregama in further strengthening its market share in the video business.

 The company also has licences to sell BBC products in India.

 The company?s market share in the home video segment rose to 21 per cent in 2003-04. ?This is likely to go up to 25 per cent in the current fiscal. We expect home video to play a key role in the revenues in the coming years,? Goenka said.

 This segment showed a sales growth of over 70 per cent for the nine months ended December 31.

 Saregama has plans of innovative marketing of Hollywood classics, including releasing the dubbed version in three languages ? Hindi, Tamil and Telugu.

 He said there would also be special collectors? edition sets of James Bond films among other marketing initiatives such as value and box sets.

 The MGM movie library has titles like The Great Escape, Platoon, Rain Man, The Great Train Robbery, Dances with Wolves, Westside Story. It also has 20 James Bond films, the Pink Panther series, the Rocky series and 19 films by Woody Allen.

 Speaking on the company?s performance in the current fiscal, he said the results of the third quarter ended December 2004 confirmed the continuation of the uptrend in the business.

 The third-quarter profit touched Rs 2.12 crore. The company has recently filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for its rights issue of Rs 24 crore.

 RPG Retail, which has planned an IPO of Rs 100 crore, has taken the private placement route to mop up funds.

 ?We are not immediately going in for IPO. We have opted for the private placement route. We are mopping up Rs 60-70 crore by privately placing with the financial institutions,? Goenka said.

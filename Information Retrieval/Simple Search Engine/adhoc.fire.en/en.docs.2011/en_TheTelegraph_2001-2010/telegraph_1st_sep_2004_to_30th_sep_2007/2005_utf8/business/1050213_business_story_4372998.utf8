 Dell earnings take a hit

 Los Angeles, Feb. 12: Strong holiday sales helped propel Dell Inc. to a seventh consecutive quarter of record revenue, but a one-time tax charge weakened earnings and rattled investors. 

 Dell said fiscal fourth-quarter profit fell to $667 million, or 26 cents per share, from $749 million, or 29 cents, a year earlier. Profit would have been 37 cents per share without the one-time charge for repatriating $4.1 billion in overseas profit under the American Jobs Creation Act. 

 Revenue for the quarter that ended January 28 rose 17 per cent to $13.5 billion. 

 For the year, Dell?s posted profit of $3.04 billion, or $1.18 per share, up 15 per cent from $2.65 billion, or $1.01, the year before. Revenue rose 19 per cent to $49.2 billion. 

 Dell shares, which rose 58 cents to $41.57 in regular Nasdaq trading, fell to $40.25 in after-hours trading following the earnings announcement during which Dell executives forecast little to no growth in the first quarter. 

 ?It was a good quarter relative to other tech companies, but uninspiring,? said Brent Bracelin, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities in Portland, Ore. ?Dell has a bar that?s higher than others, so investors were a little disappointed with their guidance for the first quarter.? 

 Round Rock, Texas-based Dell, the world?s largest personal computer maker, predicted that first-quarter revenue would come in around $13.4 billion, a shade lower than the $13.5 billion consensus by Wall Street analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call. 

 ?We have an environment heading into 2005 where the core business of the PC market grew 15 per cent last year, but we expect it to slow to 8 per cent-9 per cent in 2005,? Bracelin said. 

 ?Dell grew 18.7 per cent in 2004, so the concern is that in an industry that slows to the high single digits, can Dell continue to accelerate share gain, or find other areas to grow into at that kind of rate?? 

 Dell?s results came a day after arch rival Hewlett-Packard Co. sacked its chief executive over lackluster performance in chasing elusive profitability, a move Dell?s chief executive said could open up some opportunities for the low-cost computer manufacturer.

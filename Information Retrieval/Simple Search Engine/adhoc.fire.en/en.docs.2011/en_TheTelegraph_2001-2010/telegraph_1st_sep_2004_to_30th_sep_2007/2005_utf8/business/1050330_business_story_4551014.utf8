The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 HPL sees four-fold increase in net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Going strong

 New Delhi, March 29: Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) expects to clock a four-fold increase in net profit this fiscal to top the Rs 550-crore mark, a senior company official told The Telegraph today.

 The official, who attended the HPL board meeting, said: ?The company expects to earn over Rs 550 crore in net profit this financial year. Last year, the company had logged Rs 134 crore.?

 Chairman Tarun Das said the board meeting was held to review the financial performance of the company. He said HPL was doing remarkably well and its earnings before interest, depreciation and tax was around Rs 1,440 crore. 

 The strong financial performance may pave the way for a successful initial public offer (IPO) in the next financial year.

 Haldia Petrochem will have to float the IPO as part of the corporate debt-restructuring package extended by financial institutions when the company was reeling under heavy losses.

 The proceeds of the IPO will be used for expansion. 

 The company is in the process of getting rated by agencies and presentations have been made to Standard amp; Poor?s and Moody?s. 

 The Centre had asked Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) to invest Rs 150 crore in HPL?s equity to pave the way for the debt-restructuring package. 

 A senior IOC official said: ?The Rs 150-crore cheque was sent to HPL about three weeks ago and IOC is now waiting for the transfer of shares.? 

 IOC, which had earlier insisted on a say in the management before committing any investment, was forced to dilute its stand by the government following pressure from the Left parties.

 The Bengal government has been backing Purnendu Chatterjee and did not opt for the Rs 5,700-crore package that IOC had offered to convert Haldia into a world-class petrochemicals hub in exchange for management control.

 Purnendu, on his part, refused to relinquish management control. Earlier he had struck a deal with public sector gas major Gail (India) Ltd, which agreed to invest Rs 150 crore without insisting on taking over the reins.

 The petroleum ministry had shot down the proposal on the grounds that the public sector oil or gas majors would not be allowed to make portfolio investments to bail out private or joint venture companies without an influence in the way these companies are run. The ministry also preferred IOC over Gail for the investment.

 However, the ministry had to do a volte-face and asked IOC to make the Rs 150-crore ?portfolio investment? as the Left had won the day for Purnendu.

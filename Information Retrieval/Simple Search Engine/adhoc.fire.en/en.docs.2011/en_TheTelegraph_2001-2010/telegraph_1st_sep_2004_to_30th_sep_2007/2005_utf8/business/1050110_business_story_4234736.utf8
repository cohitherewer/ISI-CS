 The invisible hand

 Standing guarantee to others? loans can be risky. Chandralekha Tulal looks at the pitfalls 

 Walk into my parlour.? You are the guest of honour at the ?Grihapravesh? ceremony of your friend?s new house since you made their dream come true by agreeing to be the guarantor the housing finance company was insisting upon.

 As the foreclosure laws in India (laws pertaining to recovery of loan by disposing of the property) are still weak, it is difficult to take over the property of an applicant. The housing finance company, in order to safeguard its interests and to ensure that the repayment of the loan comes on time, insists on a guarantor. Some financiers require a guarantor in all cases, while others insist on one only if certain requirements are not met. By taking a guarantor, the financier also puts some sort of a moral obligation on you to repay the loan.

 A guarantor is a person who gives a promise or ?guarantee? to a creditor or lender to be answerable for the debt or obligation of another (the principal debtor or borrower) in case of defaults.

 Most of us do not pay due attention before becoming a guarantor for a colleague, friend or relative. But be sure to read the fine print of the letter of guarantee before signing up to act as a guarantor.

 As a guarantor, you should satisfy all the norms relating to age and income of a normal customer. You will have to shell out your personal information to the lender for their credit investigation to assess your repaying capacity, source of income, proof of residence and so on before accepting you as a guarantor.

 This is because as the guarantor it is your equal legal obligation to repay the loan in case the borrower defaults. Not only the principal amount along with the interest to the fullest extent, it becomes your onus to take on the liability to pay any additional interest, expenses for default, commitment charges, extra charges on arrears, service charges, redemption premium or any costs associated with the loan.

 The liability of the guarantor under the Indian Contract Act is co-extensive with that of the borrower. If the borrower has no repaying capacity or asset, it is open to the lender to proceed against you and your assets. Generally the lender proceeds against both the guarantor and the borrower simultaneously.

 This is not all: the guarantee being a continuing one is also binding on your heirs, administrators and successors.

 So be careful before you agree to act as a guarantor for someone. Be fully satisfied with the intention and repayment capacity of the person for whom you are acting as a guarantor or you may end up in trouble for being a good Samaritan. 

 Weigh the following questions before sealing your fate with a signature on the letter of guarantee: 

 What is the borrower?s 

 ability to service and repay the loan?

 What is the creditworthiness 

 of the borrower?

 What is the risk?

 What is the likelihood 

 of the debt being called?

 In considering whether to act as a guarantor for a person, you should never guarantee payment for more than you can afford and should never put your home or assets at risk.

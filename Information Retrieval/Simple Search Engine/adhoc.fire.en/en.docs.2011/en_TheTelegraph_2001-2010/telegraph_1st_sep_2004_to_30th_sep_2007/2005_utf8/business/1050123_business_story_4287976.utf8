 US rate hike in small doses

 San Francisco, Jan. 22 (Reuters): More US interest rate increases lie ahead, but they would likely not need to be at a faster pace because inflation is contained, Federal Reserve officials said on Friday. 

 A recent uptick in inflation ? partly the result of high energy costs ? should moderate, allowing for gradual rate increases, Fed Gov. Susan Bies said. There is still ?quite a bit of slack? in the US economy, which has ?room to run?, she said. 

 Bies said hikes could continue to be measured, the Fed?s term for its programme of small rate increases that has produced five one-quarter percentage point moves since June. 

 Some have guessed that the Federal Open Market Committee might replace the ?measured? term at its next meeting February 1-2 in favour of language that refers to being responsive to data. But a report in Business Week published on Friday cited ?associates? of Fed chairman Alan Greenspan as saying the Fed chief was happy to keep raising rates at a steady pace. Separately, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed, said the FOMC would be able to inoculate the US economy from inflation fired up by a cheaper US dollar. 

 Policy-makers are ?capable of keeping inflation and inflation expectations steady,? even though a falling dollar makes imports more expensive, he said in a speech in Richmond. 

 Minneapolis Fed President Gary Stern said in Marquette, Michigan, that he was not surprised that the weaker US dollar ? down roughly 30 per cent against major currencies in the past three years ? has not helped the country?s trade balance. Rising American incomes have boosted demand for imports even as prices may have risen due to the softer dollar, Stern said.

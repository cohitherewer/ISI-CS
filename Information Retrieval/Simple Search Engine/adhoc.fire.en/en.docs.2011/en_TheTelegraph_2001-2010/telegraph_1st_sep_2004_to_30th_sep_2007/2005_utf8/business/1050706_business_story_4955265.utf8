 BP output higher in second quarter

 London, July 5 (Reuters): BP Plc, the worlds number-two oil firm by market value, said on Tuesday its second-quarter production rose 3.5 per cent compared with the same period last year, faster than some analysts had expected. 

 The London-based oil giant added in its quarterly trading statement that it was on track to meet its 2005 production goal of 4.1 to 4.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOEPD). However, higher charges, reported due to new accounting rules, spooked some dealers. Overall production, which varies seasonally, was around 4.11 million BOEPD compared with 3.97 million BOEPD in the second quarter of 2004, a rise of 3.5 per cent. 

 Analysts at Citigroup had predicted a rise of 1.4 per cent, while others had said BP would not move toward its target range before the fourth quarter, when a number of big projects are expected to come on line. BP said oil and gas realisations, its actual receipts from fuel sales, rose in line with benchmarks, suggesting the firm is capturing the upside of oil prices.

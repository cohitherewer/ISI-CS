 Budget to help sustain high growth

Washington, April 16 (PTI): India will 

grow by 7-8 per cent this fiscal and emerge as one of the fastest growing nations 

worldwide, finance minister P. Chidambaram said today.

 ?The 2005-06 Union budget envisages achieving and maintaining an annual growth rate between 7-8 per cent,? he said, addressing the international Monetary and financial committee of the IMF here.

 He said India has emerged as one of the fastest growing countries in recent times.

 Chidambaram said the budget also aims at promoting investment, generating employment, accelerating fiscal consolidation or reducing fiscal and revenue deficits, and ensuring higher fiscal devolution to states.

 ?Greater emphasis is laid on agriculture, manufacturing and infrastructure,? he said, adding the budget aims to directly address the issue of poverty by focusing on the linkage between agricultural and infrastructure development and employment generation. 

Worry over oil prices

 India today attacked oil producing and developed nations for lack of concern for developing countries, whose growth prospects have been dampened by the spiralling global fuel prices.

 Voicing ?profound disappointment?, Chidambaram publicly criticised oil producing nations for not making adequate efforts to stabilise fuel prices that were hovering over $50 a barrel for nearly six months.

 ?As a developing country, I must voice my profound disappointment that the oil producing countries, and other developed countries, show little concern for the burden that high oil prices put on our development efforts,? he said.

 ?The persistence of high oil prices poses a risk to growth in major oil importing countries like India, China and the US,? he said.

 ?Current expectations are that oil prices are likely to remain high and volatile in the medium term, due to growing demand, narrowing excess capacity and overall susceptibility to shocks,? Chidambaram added.

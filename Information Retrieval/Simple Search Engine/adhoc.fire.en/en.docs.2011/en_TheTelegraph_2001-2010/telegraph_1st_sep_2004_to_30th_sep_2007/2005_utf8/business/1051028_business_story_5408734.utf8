 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 27: Steel Authority of India Ltd posted a drop in earnings during the second quarter ended September 30 due to higher tax provisions. 

 The country?s largest steel maker?s net profit stood at Rs 1,126.76 crore, down 25.53 per cent from Rs 1,513.15 crore in the same period last year. 

 The net profit was lower mainly due to a higher tax provision of Rs 270 crore, chairman V.S. Jain told reporters here today.

 During the April-September period, the company has booked a net profit of Rs 2,251 crore against Rs 2,625 crore last year.

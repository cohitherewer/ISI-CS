 Reverse swing in markets

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 28: Volatility returned to bourses as investors in derivatives contracts held back fresh purchases and sent the sensex slipping 25.65 points to 9257.51. 

 Such was the roller-coaster that the key market barometer swung in a range of 143 points in the session, which also saw a clutch of local mutual funds booking profits.

 The selling pressure intensified in the afternoon, when operators cleared outstanding positions ahead of the end of December derivatives contracts closing on Thursday. 

 The 30-share index opened at 9292.18, hit an intra-day high of 9350.82 and plunged to 207.27 before ending at 9257.51, showing a decline of 0.28 per cent over its previous finish.

 Analysts reckon that the gyrations are likely to continue in the next couple of days because of limited investor participation over the last few days of this year.

 While foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have continued to remain net buyers recently, their participation is expected to diminish over the next few sessions. 

 The star of the session was Reliance Industries, which hit a life-time high of Rs 883.00 as investors applauded the decision by exchanges to hold a special session on January 18. Though the scrip settled at Rs 872.40, the closing marked a gain of Rs 5.65 over its previous finish.

 The volume of business on BSE rose to Rs 3469.94 crore from Rs 3,005.82 crore on Tuesday. The Reliance share was the turnover topper with a tally of Rs 523.64 crore, followed by Titan (Rs 181.01 crore), SBI (Rs 139.47 crore), Reliance Capital (Rs 110.31 crore) and Satyam (Rs 86.36 crore).

 Rupee firm

 The rupee closed at 45.14 against the dollar, which weakened against other world currencies. Gains in the local currency were also fuelled by the flow of foreign funds, especially exporters earnings stashed in foreign accounts. The rupee had closed around 45.27 on Tuesday.

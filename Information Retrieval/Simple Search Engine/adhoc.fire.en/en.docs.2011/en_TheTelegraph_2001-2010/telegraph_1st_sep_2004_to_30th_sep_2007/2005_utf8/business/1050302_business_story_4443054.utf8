 Hive-off plan for wings of twin carriers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 1: The government is planning to hive off ground handling and engineering wings of the two state-run carriers ? Indian Airlines and Air-India ? into joint ventures with foreign firms, including airlines. 

 Civil aviation minister Praful Patel said, ?The proposal has been cleared and the process is likely to be completed and made operational by the end of fiscal 2005.? 

 The minister said the two state-run airlines have already begun working on their initial public offers and would appoint financial consultants by the end of 2005-06 to expedite the move to infuse equity. 

 The government has announced infusion of Rs 325 crore equity into IA to help build up its capital base before it acquires new aircraft. 

 Patel said the planned JVs for ground handling and engineering could either be set up jointly or separately by the airlines after tying up with foreign airlines or other aviation sector firms to optimally use the large technical and human asset bases of the two state-run airlines.

 Over a year ago, Indian Airlines engineers had threatened a wildcat agitation over plans to join hands with Singapore International Airlines to set up a joint venture engineering and maintenance firm.

 Airline unions had described the pact to study ?the feasibility of such a venture? as a ?backdoor attempt to privatise?.

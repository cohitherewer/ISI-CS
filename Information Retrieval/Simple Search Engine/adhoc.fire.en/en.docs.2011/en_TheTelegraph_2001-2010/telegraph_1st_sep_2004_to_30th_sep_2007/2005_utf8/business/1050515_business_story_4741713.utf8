 Whiff of merger in US air 

 Flying high 

 Washington, May 14 (Reuters): Bankrupt US Airways Group Inc and America West Holdings Corp are in parleys for a proposed merger that would begin as a marketing alliance and take shape in stages, said an industry source close to the negotiation dialogue. 

 The plan could be concluded before the America West board meeting on May 17, followed by a US Airways bankruptcy court hearing in Virginia two days later. 

 ?The deal is more or less done and will be announced next week,? said the source on condition of anonymity.

 Staging the deal would give US Airways more time to further align its costs with America West, a goal the seventh-largest airline has expressed since entering bankruptcy in September last year for the second time in two years. 

 However, officials for Virginia-based US Airways and America West, headquartered in Phoenix, have refused to confirm that a deal is near. 

 Code sharing is common among major domestic and international carriers who sell seats on each other?s flights. Marketing alliances have been popular because they are cheap and easier to launch and manage than mergers. 

 Federal transportation regulators, too, look favourably on code shares, and industry experts envision no antitrust issues that could undermine a merger based on existing routes and operations of the two carriers. 

 US Airways? financial troubles could help approval of a merger as regulators relax requirements when a ?failing? company is involved. 

 The government oversees more than $1 billion Federal loan guarantees given to the two airlines to stabilise the industry after the 9/11 attack and has avoided any action to hinder US Airways? restructuring. 

 It is, though, unclear how the transaction will be financed. US Airways has commitments for $250 million from two regional airlines but must come up with another $100 million. 

 Industry experts said the company could sell coveted airport gates in Washington or New York and other assets to raise cash or realise new financing from outside sources. 

 ?There is a lot they could do without investing much,? said Michael Boyd, a Colorado-based aviation consultant. 

 Boyd and other industry observers said a careful but imaginative deal done in stages would make more sense than an outright merger because putting the two companies together immediately would not reduce over-capacity ? a reason why airlines have been losing billions each year.

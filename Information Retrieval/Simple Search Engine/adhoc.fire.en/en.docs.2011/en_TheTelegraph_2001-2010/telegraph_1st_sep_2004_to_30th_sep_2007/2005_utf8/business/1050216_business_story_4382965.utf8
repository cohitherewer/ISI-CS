 Transfer notice to Hind Copper 

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Destination unknown

 Calcutta, Feb. 15: The UPA government has sent a directive to Hindustan Copper Limited (HCL) to shift its headquarters from Calcutta to New Delhi.

 The directive (memo number: 5(5)/2003 - Met iii), dated February 10 and issued by Vinod Kumar, director, ministry of mines, reads: ?I am directed to say that keeping in view various administrative, locational and financial parameters the ministry of mines has decided that the headquarters of HCL may be shifted from Calcutta to Delhi.?

 ?On administrative exigencies, the chairman and managing director of the company may decide to retain a nucleus staff at Calcutta,? it added.

 The directive has come as a blow to the company at a time when it has turned around and is mulling an initial public offering (IPO). 

 The company is now in the black and has undertaken a financial re-engineering exercise to reduce the debt burden.

 This is for the third time that the Calcutta-based PSU is facing the threat of a shift. 

 When Ram Vilas Paswan was the Union minister of coal and mines in 2002, HCL received a similar directive to shift its headquarters.

 Mamata Banerjee had intervened as an NDA ally and the order was kept in abeyance.

 A similar order to shift the HCL headquarters within 15-20 days was issued at the end of 2003 when Ramesh Vyas was the state minister of mines. At that time, too, Banerjee intervened and the move was stalled.

 The headquarters of Hindustan Copper is in Calcutta since May 1973. The company had set up its own building in the city ? Tamra Bhavan ? in 1995.

 ?We will not allow the government to shift the headquarters from Calcutta to New Delhi within ten years of setting up our own building,? said Shyamal Banerjee, general secretary, HCL head office staff union.

 The employees have decided to take up the matter with the Left Front ? a major ally of the UPA government. They will also take up the matter with Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.

 Two Left Front MPs ? Sunil Khan and Swadesh Chakroborty ? have recently made it clear at the meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on industry that the headquarters of HCL should not be shifted to Delhi.

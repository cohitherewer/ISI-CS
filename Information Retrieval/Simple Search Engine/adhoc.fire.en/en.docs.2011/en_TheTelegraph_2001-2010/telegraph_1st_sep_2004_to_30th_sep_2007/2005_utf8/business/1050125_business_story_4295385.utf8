 New Delhi, Jan. 24: Reliance Infocomm?s investment plans will not be affected by the ongoing feud in the Reliance group between the Ambani brothers, Anil and Mukesh.

 The company today announced that the Rs 24,000-crore investment plans are on target and unveiled the expansion plans during 2005-06.

 Reliance Infocomm has set a target to offer phones in 4 lakh villages by the year-end. It has also set a target to double its subscriber base to 20.6 million in March 2006 from the existing one of about 10 million. Reliance Infocomm offers telephone services in 75,000 villages across the country at present.

 Announcing grandiose plans for the company, Kamal Nanavaty, chief operating officer of Reliance Infocomm?s wireless business, said, ?I do not wish to comment on what is happening in the group but it will have no impact on the expansion plans of Reliance Infocomm. We have already invested Rs 15,000 crore of the Rs 24,000 crore announced at the time of the inception of the company.?

 The company also has set a target to match those set by the government-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd to offer broadband services in every village by 2012. Reliance Infocomm will offer voice and data (broadband) in two out of three villages by December 2005 where it has set its network.

 It also announced the rolling out of a massive network covering 92 per cent of national highways and 85 per cent of railway routes that is aimed to benefit 90 per cent of Indian habitats. Reliance Infocomm?s 80,000 kilometres of terabit fibre optic cable network (it will have more than enough capacity to carry the entire Internet traffic across the world in a single cable) will form the backbone of its countrywide expansion plan, which will help offer unlimited and uninterrupted voice and data and video applications.

 The company has claimed that the efforts to be undertaken during the year will play a major role in achieving the country?s increased teledensity at 10 phones for 1000 people.

 Reliance Infocomm claimed that its entire network by the end of March 2006 will touch more than 80 crore people across the country, which will be more than 50 per cent of the existing population of the country. 

 Commenting on the quality of service once the subscriber base increases and outgrows the network capacity, the company said it is in talks with the department of telecommunications and Wireless Planning Commission to get additional spectrum (airwaves that carry voice and data from one phone to another).

 Regarding the plans for an initial public offer (IPO), the company executive said, ?The IPO is still a long way off.? 

 ?We reiterate our commitment to bridge the digital divide by taking the fruits of the infocom revolution to the vast Indian populace, especially those residing in rural India,? Mukesh Ambani had said in a statement.

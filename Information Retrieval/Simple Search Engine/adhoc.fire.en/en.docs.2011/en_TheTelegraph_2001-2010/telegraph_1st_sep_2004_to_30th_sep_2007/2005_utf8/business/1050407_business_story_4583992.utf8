 Coal e-auction gains ground

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Turning point

 Calcutta, April 6: Coal India Limited has decided to introduce e-auction of coal in South Eastern Coalfields Limited (SECL).

 SECL, the largest coal producing subsidiary of Coal India, plans to start selling coal through the e-auction system on a trial basis.

 Currently, coal is mainly being sold by SECL to core and non-core sector consumers against linkages granted by the ministry concerned and Coal India. Coal was also offered for sale in the past under the open sales scheme, from time to time, on a surplus availability basis.

 E-auction is being introduced to bring about more transparency in marketing of coal to non-core consumers who, in fact, can get coal grades of their choice at market-determined prices from a particular source/siding. 

 Under the new system, buyers can access the bidding process, which is more transparent. 

 Coal would be sold at a market-determined price, thereby reducing the chances of black marketing. Anybody can register for e-auction online. Any bidder from any part of the country will be free to bid for coal from any mine/siding on offer without any reference to linkage. 

 All bidders will have to register with a service provider by paying a token sum to have an access to bidding. A prospective bidder should submit an expression of intention regarding the quantity one intends to bid. Lot size, in case of rail, is one rake and in case of road, it will be 50/100/500/1000 tonnes as the case may be. Small consumers can combine to form rake loads. 

 Coal companies will fix a floor price for each lot, which will not be less than the declared/notified price. Bidders will not be allowed to bid below the floor price. Successful bidders will be informed about quantity and value of coal through e-mail. Security deposits will be returned to unsuccessful bidders. The company will deliver coal within three months from the date of auction, provided successful bidders deposit full value or execute bank guarantee for rail/demand draft for road within three days. 

 Currently, only 7 per cent of coal is being offered under the e-auction system to non-linked consumers. Coal India has 2,700 linked consumers at present. 

 E-auction was recently introduced in Bharat Coking Coal Ltd for selling 1.4 lakh tonnes of coal and the process was successful. 

 Coal India will further extend this facility in a phased manner as a mode of marketing to all other consumers, except the power sector.

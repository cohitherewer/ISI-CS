 Sahara Computers to extend reach

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 19: Sahara Computers and Electronics Ltd (SCEL) will take its PC business to satellite cities and towns in the country at an investment of Rs 400 crore.

 SCEL, a joint venture between South African infotech firm Sahara Computers (Pty) Ltd and Sahara India Pariwar, has unveiled its plans to expand the PC market in India with a focus on mobile solutions in the next two years. 

 The company will offer various loan schemes to PC buyers in small towns. SCEL has tied up with most of the leading banks to offer loans under its Goldmine project, which will cover 700 towns. 

 A similar programme in Africa has helped the company become the fastest growing brand there.

 We not only compete in the existing space but also bring innovative products, which are priced aggressively. We combine this with unique marketing initiatives that lead to greater penetration of the product in markets that are not yet tapped, said George Van Der Merwe, chief operating officer of SCEL.

 Given the strengths of local manufacturing and our expertise in R amp;D, we are aiming for market leadership in the PC segment by 2007. We also want to grow the PC market in India, Merwe added.

 The company has tied up with over 6,000 conventional IT channel partners, including local and regional distributors, resellers and dealers across the country. It has one national distributor, SES Technology. 

 SCEL will invest Rs 150 crore to expand the PC market. It will invest another Rs 150 crore to promote IT Junction, a multi-branded IT store.

 The company has set aside Rs 100 crore for promoting sales through unconventional channels, including the creation of various retail stores.

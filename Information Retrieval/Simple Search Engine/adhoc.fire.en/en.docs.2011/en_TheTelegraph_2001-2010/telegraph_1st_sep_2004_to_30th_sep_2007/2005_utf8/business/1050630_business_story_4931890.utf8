 Tata Motors in Thai quest

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 29: Tata Motors is in talks with Thai Rung Union Car, an assembler of modified vehicles.

 The Thai company came up with a proposal for an alliance. Market sources said the two companies had signed a preliminary agreement last week to produce pick-up trucks in Thailand for the domestic and overseas markets. Thai Rung, however, denied this. Tata Motors admitted it was in talks but said no agreement has been signed.

 We have not signed an understanding with the Tatas, Decha Chooligorn, Thai Rungs assistant managing director, said. We are still in the preliminary study phase, evaluating information and mutual business opportunities.

 Tata Motors has a presence in South Asia since it acquired the commercial vehicles unit of Daewoo, the South Korean auto major.

 Industry sources say Tata Motors is expected to sign the deal within three to four weeks for production of pick-up trucks in Thailand, the largest market for pick-up vehicles in the world outside the US.

 Tata Motors said it was exploring ways to establish a presence in Thailand and was in discussions with prospective partners for possible co-operation. It refused to confirm whether a deal would be signed soon.

 Industry sources say the deal will be announced soon and production will start from next year. Production would begin with the Tata 207 vehicle.

 The Tatas have been aggressive in expanding their global presence. Recently, the company acquired a Spanish bus body manufacturer, which also has operations in Morocco.

 Tata Motors is the leading manufacturer of commercial vehicles in India. The company is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.

 Analysts had termed this move as a step to use its stock as a vehicle to acquire auto companies abroad.

 The local commercial vehicle scene is also seeing a lot of action with new players expressing their intent to take part in the industry. 

 Mahindra amp; Mahindra, a leading utility vehicle and tractor maker had recently signed an agreement with a US company for making trucks in India. 

 Bajaj Tempo also has plans to make MAN trucks of Germany in India. Hyundai also has plans to enter this segment in India.

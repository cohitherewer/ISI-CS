 Air-India on economy flight

 SATISH JOHN

 As the crow flies

 Mumbai, June 8: As the crow flies... That?s the route Air-India?s supposed to take to cut fuel costs.

 Air-India pilots have been asked to explore the shortest flight paths by using their navigational skills, chairman V. Thulasidas told The Telegraph.

 The India-London route is shorter as Air-India flies further up north over Afghanistan, past Russia, to London.

 Thulasidas said the pilots have been asked to use their discretion to decide on the altitude to save fuel. Last year, Air-India spent Rs 700 crore more on its fuel bill.

 Unlike other airlines, almost a fourth of Air-India?s costs are on account of fuel, while the same bill for any foreign airline is around 18 per cent of its total costs. 

 West Asia-based Emirates has spent just 11 per cent of its total expenditure on fuel. However, the proximity to oil-producing nations is an advantage.

 Thulasidas said by reducing the take-off and landing time, airlines can save on fuel too. However, air traffic control at the airport can influence this and airline often cannot do much. 

 Thulasidas said A-I pilots have been asked to refill in places where oil is cheaper. The concept called ?economic tankering? helps the airline to cut costs, especially when ATF rates in India are among the highest in the world. 

 However, heavier loads mean more oil being consumed and so the pilot decides how much needs to be stored.

 ?On an average, the distance between Mumbai and London is 7450 KM, and Delhi and London is 7175 KM,? an Air-India official said.

 ?Air-India operates flights between India and Europe by conducting a ?route search?. We have clearances from all countries between India and Europe to fly all possible air traffic service routes in their airspace,? he said.

 ?Computerised analysis of various factors determine the route on a particular day. Distance is not the only criteria, wind component and availability of flight paths is also part of the analysis,? he said. 

 ?We analyse the technical aspects and determine the day?s optimum route,? he added. 

 Air-India will also hedge its exposure to volatile oil prices by betting on oil derivative instruments.

 Unctad can count on India

 New Delhi, Nov. 28: India will back the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) to come out as a more focussed organisation from the UN reform process.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath today assured Unctad secretary-general Supachai Panitchpakdi that India would back the developing countries against the Western nations move to whittle down the role of Unctad.

 Supachai had sought Indias support for Unctad in the context of the UN reform process that might end up sidelining the institution instead of strengthening it, especially at a time when global trade was on the rise and developing nations were increasingly being drawn into its ambit. 

 Nath told a meeting this morning that Unctad has an important role to play as an agency for trade and development and should be strengthened and sustained in view of its institutional strengths and expertise built up over the years. Commerce secretary S.N. Menon and Unctad director Lakshmi Puri also attended the meeting. 

 Nath suggested that Unctad should build up a database for global trade attracting more countries to engage with it as an institution. He agreed with the secretary-general that Unctad should emerge from the UN reform process as a more focused and stronger organisation. The test for the Unctad in the coming years would be its capacity to deliver its core activities such as research and policy analysis and consensus building.

 Supachai indicated that he had already set up a group of eminent persons on trade and development issues. He also offered to organise next year an Indian investment policy review on the lines of similar events it had organised for other countries earlier.

 Later talking to reporters, Supachai welcomed the proactive role that India was playing at the WTO negotiations. Supachai said, We must not pin exaggerated expectations on the Hong Kong ministerial being held next month. Although all the issues were not expected to be resolved at the meeting, it would definitely generate sufficient momentum in the talks so that some agreement could be reached in 2006.

 He added that though the modalities on the various WTO issues have been worked out, it would still take six months to a year to finally implement the agreements between various countries. There are thousands of tariff lines that have to be looked at while implementing the agreements, Supachai said. 

 He noted that agriculture was not the only issue that was being talked about at the WTO and there had been considerable progress made on other issues such as services and those related to trade-related intellectual property rights and pharmaceuticals. Similarly, the Singapore issues relating to trade, investment, competition policy and transparency in government procurement had also been resolved, Supachai added.

 ITC whips up growth recipe for foods unit

 RAJA GHOSHAL 

 New Delhi, April 3: ITC is betting big on its ?ready-to-eat? foods business, with new products in the offing.

 Speaking to The Telegraph, a senior company executive said the Bangalore-based foods division will soon launch a range of ready-to-eat seasonal vegetable preparations under the Aashirvaad brand.

 ?The idea is to replace the neighbourhood grocer with seasonal ready-to-eat offerings from Aashirvaad. We have planned seasonal vegetable delicacies based on beans, peas and others. Bhindi has already been launched. Priced between Rs 30-35 a pack, the Aashirvaad range includes palak paneer, rajma, pindi chana and dal makhni. A final list of seasonal vegetables is being finalised by the company,? the executive said.

 Also under preparation are certain non-vegetarian dishes from the kitchens of ITC hotels. One such item is keema-muttor. But these products are likely to be launched under the high-end brand ? Kitchens of India. The brand?s products include dal bukhara, chicken chettinad, and khubani ka meetha. These are priced around Rs 90 for a small tin, weighing around 400 gms.

 The ITC foods division, which is into confectionery and commodities like atta and suji, is open to brand acquisitions in these categories. The company has also decided to foray into international ready-to-eat dishes such as pasta. Sources say more such exquisite preparations are in the offing.

 ITC forayed into the foods and garment retailing business about four years back, when the company took a policy decision to reduce its dependence on cigarettes and use its sales and marketing muscles to diversify into areas like foods and clothing. 

 ITC is tight-lipped about revenue generation from these divisions. However sources said much as it may want, the company is still heavily dependent on cigarettes for its earnings.

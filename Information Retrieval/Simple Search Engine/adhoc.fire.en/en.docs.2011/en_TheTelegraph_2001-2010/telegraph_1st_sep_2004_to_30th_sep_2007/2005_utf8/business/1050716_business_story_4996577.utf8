 Govt sees 25% rise in FDI 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 15: The government foresees $7 billion foreign direct investment this year, up 25 per cent from last fiscal.

 In 2004-05, India received $5.6 billion in FDI, said Ajay Dua, secretary, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion. 

 Dua was addressing ambassadors and high commissioners of different countries in India at a meeting organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 The sustained increase in FDI inflows in the country can be attributed to the level playing field provided to all foreign companies investing in India, large scale reduction in customs duties and option to foreign companies to pay taxes in accordance with bilateral tax treaties, Dua said.

 The establishment of a firm patent regime with adequate safeguards has also encouraged foreign investors to bring in their money here, he added.

 Wake-up call for banks 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, Nov. 14: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today sent a strong signal to all banks in the country to put in place all necessary anti-money laundering measures before December 31.

 Compliance with this deadline was a significant challenge to the entire banking industry to fortify itself against misuse by anti-social persons/entities and thus project a picture of solidarity and financial integrity of the Indian banking system to the international community. RBI deputy governor V. Leeladhar said while delivering a lecture here today.

 Leeladhar said RBI, in November last year, had already sent detailed guidelines to all private and scheduled commercial banks to ensure that a proper policy framework on Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering Measures were formulated.

 All the banks, with the approval of their respective boards, ought to have fully complied with those guidelines within three months since then, he said.

 Even way back in 2002, banks were advised to follow certain customer identification procedure for opening of accounts and monitoring transactions of a suspicious nature for the purpose of reporting it to the appropriate authority, Leeladhar said.

 Stating that new private sector banks and foreign banks in India have rapidly changed the competitive landscape in the consumer banking industry, Leeladhar cautioned against the intrusive nature of new banks.

 Referring to an example where a foreign bank issued an unsolicited demand draft of Rs 1.50 lakh to a customer who had just opened an account, the RBI deputy governor said this became an uncalled for liability for that the customer. 

 He sent back the demand draft to the bank saying he did not need it, but quickly found that Rs 750 had already been debited in his account towards DD charges, Leeladhar said. And to the unsuspecting customers shock, his account was further debited Rs 26,000, towards the first instalment of EMI, because everything is computerised now, he said.

 But the RBI does not want such type of intrusions where consumers are not accorded full protection, he said and came down heavily on the recent trend of unreasonably high service/user charges without proper and prior intimation.

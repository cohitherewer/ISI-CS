 CMIE forecasts higher growth at 6.8%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 12: The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy today revised upwards its growth forecast for the current fiscal to 6.8 per cent from 6 per cent on the back of an improved prospect for the agricultural sector due to the revival of monsoon.

 The economic think-tank today said the forecast of a higher GDP growth in real terms reflects the upward revision of growth in the agricultural and allied sector. CMIE projected that the agricultural sector would grow by 3 per cent against a 0.7 per cent decline predicted earlier.

 In June, CMIE cut down its growth forecast to 6 per cent from 6.6 per cent as it apprehended an adverse impact on the farm sector output by a delayed and inadequate monsoon. It then estimated that the agriculture and allied sector output would fall by 0.7 per cent (negative growth) instead of a 3.1 per cent growth projected in April.

 In a statement issued today, CMIE said the farm sectors growth projection was revised taking into consideration the revival of monsoon from the last week of June, which has substantially improved the prospects for agricultural output. 

 The enhanced precipitation, coupled with a better spatial distribution, helped the recovery in sowing progress for the kharif season, the statement said. 

 Accordingly, foodgrain production is projected 1.5 per cent higher at 208.5 million tonnes against 203.5 million tonnes estimated earlier. The growth in non-foodgrain production has also been revised 3.1 per cent higher than the earlier forecast. Allied agricultural activities such as livestock, fishing and forestry are now expected to grow by 4 per cent during this fiscal.

 CMIEs outlook for the industrial sector, however, remains unchanged with the growth projection for this pillar of the economy maintained at 8.5 per cent as before. The economic growth, measured by the real GDP, would be led by the manufacturing sector, the centre said.

 The construction industry has been projected to grow at 10 per cent during the year due to accelerated investment in this sector, CMIE said. But it maintained its growth forecast for the services sector, which accounts for more than 50 per cent of GDP, at 7.5 per cent. This growth would largely come from trade, hotel, transport and communications sector, the economic think-tank said.

 Presenting the first quarter review of the annual monetary policy for 2005-06, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) recently said the index of industrial production increased by 9.6 per cent during April-May 2005 aided by 10.5 per cent growth in the manufacturing output.

 Back-office jobs need to shift focus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 30: India should shift focus from generic BPO to industry specific BPO to increase market share, a Gartner study on outsourcing intentions of industries said today.

 The global market for outsourcing will grow from $305.85 billion (about Rs 13,00,000 crore) in 2004 to $445.9 billion dollars (Rs 19,5,0,000) in 2009 at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.8 per cent, said Craig Baty, group vice-president and chief of research, Gartner revealing the study at the Gartner India Summit. 

 The BPO component of this will grow at a CAGR of 9.2 per cent ? from $114.8 billion in 2004 to $179.35 billion in 2009.

 This, in other words, means that about 61 per cent of global spending on outsourcing is for information technology services and the remaining 39 per cent is for the relatively newer concept of BPO. 

 These growth rates are extremely healthy compared to other IT sectors. As companies have tried to lower the cost of IT operations and focus on their core business processes, outsourcing has become a well-accepted means of accomplishing these goals.

 Gartners worldwide forecast for outsourcing can be broken down across 11 industries. The financial services, manufacturing and government contributed the bulk of total outsourcing spending between 2003 and 2004 and are expected to do so for the next five years.

 Although all verticals are candidates for offshore work of many kinds, those that have a heavy tendency to consider a global delivery model (offshoring) are in the manufacturing, transportation and banking and investment sectors. 

 This is culturally more acceptable to these industries as they have already been operating in a globalised market for some decades. Government, retail and utilities, on the other hand, are less likely to consider offshoring, the report said. 

 Baty said, Based on our 2004 survey of outsourcing and BPO intentions by vertical, it is quite clear that although there will still be robust growth in the traditional areas of manufacturing and financial services industries, this will slow down as it nears saturation towards 2008. 

 Although many other industries remain relatively untapped in terms of outsourcing, this does not necessarily mean that the offshore model for outsourcing delivery will be the preferred means.

 Many of the emerging industries such as the government, retail and utilities may in fact prefer to outsource locally. So Indian companies wishing to ride the growth curve capitalising these markets need to establish local delivery capabilities in each market, especially when targeting the governments, Baty pointed out.

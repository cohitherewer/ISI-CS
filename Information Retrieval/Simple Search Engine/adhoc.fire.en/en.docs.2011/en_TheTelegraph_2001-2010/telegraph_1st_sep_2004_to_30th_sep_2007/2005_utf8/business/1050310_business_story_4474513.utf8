 IBP seeks Rs 350cr bailout package

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Fuel for thought

 Calcutta, March 9: IBP Ltd has sought a special package of Rs 350 crore from the ministry of petroleum and natural gas to save it from slipping into the red for the first time in its 97-year history.

 The city-based oil marketing giant, which is on its way to loose independent status, is looking for the compensation to offset the losses suffered due to under recovery in kerosene and cooking gas (LPG).

 The company has communicated its plea to the ministry earlier this month and is awaiting a response.

 In the absence of any special package from the government, IBP is set to suffer losses in the region of Rs 120 crore for the financial year 2004-05.

 So far, it has suffered under recovery worth Rs 264.62 crore, net-off recovery under loss sharing scheme approved by the ministry on account of kerosene and cooking gas, against Rs 92.56 crore in the corresponding period last year. 

 According to the subsidy-sharing formula worked out by the ministry whereby upstream companies like Gail and ONGC are asked to pay one-third of the under recovery faced by the oil marketing companies, IBP has received Rs 135 crore in the first nine months of this fiscal.

 IBP is the only oil marketing company that does not have a refinery.

 Companies like IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) have also suffered under recoveries but refining gains offset their marketing losses.

 With crude oil prices soaring to over $50 a barrel, the refining margin was strong for all companies.

 Given its precarious condition, the company has sought full compensation for its loss instead of the established formula of sharing one-third of the under recovery. If the government agrees to the IBP plea, the company will actually post profit.

 IBP has requested the government to absolve it from the responsibility of selling kerosene and cooking gas to check mounting losses.

 During the first 11 months of this year, the operations of fuel oil (petrol and diesel) has been revenue-neutral, even if it amounted to under recovery of Rs 271.92 crore compared with the industry-expected margin.

 The company, however, did exceedingly well in all physical parameters. Its diesel sales grew by 14 per cent against industry growth of 6 per cent. Its petrol sales grew by 12 per cent against 5 per cent recorded by the industry. 

 The company is also setting up 550 retail outlets this year to take its tally to 3300. By the end of December, it has 3,114 retail outlets in the country.

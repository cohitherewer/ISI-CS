 End to steel slump in sight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 14: The domestic steel industry, laid low by a recent slump in prices as global supplies outstrip demand, foresees a course reversal from September. 

 Early this month, firms slashed prices by 5-8 per cent following sluggish international demand and an inventory pile-up in some countries. It followed a reduction of Rs 500-2000 per tonne, made only weeks back.

 While international prices of hot rolled coils are now in the region of $500 per tonne, experts are of the view that the sluggishness will persist in the short term.

 A senior official from a leading private sector steel company said while firms have been successful in bringing down inventories in some markets, these continue to be high in other areas of the country. This may lead to the inference of more price cuts. On the other hand, lower production at some of the plants is expected to stem a dramatic decline in future, he added.

 The official predicted a recovery in prices from September as stockists step up purchases. Also, demand tends to be stronger during these times in developed markets.

 Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman is one of those betting on a September spike, but expects prices to stabilise at $450 per tonne after hardening for some time.

 Muthuraman, however, ruled out any revision in prices under long-term contracts. 

 There will be no change in these prices as we need to keep them at a level at which the company can sell, he said on the sidelines of a conference on the steel industry here today. Asked about the demand for steel, he said it was likely to grow 4.5-5 per cent globally and 7-8 per cent in India.

 China pulls past Italy, Britain next

 Beijing, Dec. 20 (Reuters): China on Tuesday raised its estimate of the output of the world?s fastest-expanding major economy by a sixth, a revision that leaves growth better balanced but may increase pressure on Beijing to let the yuan rise faster.

 The new estimate, based on a vast nationwide census, hoists China above Italy into sixth place in the world economic rankings of 2004 output, measured in dollars at market exchange rates. India ranks tenth on this scale.

 What?s more, based on exchange rate movements and relative growth rates in 2005, economists calculate that China by now has risen to fourth place, ahead of France and Britain, and behind only the United States, Japan and Germany.

 The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) said the revision reflected better information on the services sector and on private firms, unearthed during a year-long survey for which the government mobilised 13 million data-gathers ? one in every 100 Chinese.

 For investors, the bigger economic pie means some ratios that had looked worryingly high, such as investment or bad loans as a share of GDP, now look more sustainable.

 ?The revised statistics show that China?s economic structure is more reasonable and healthy than the previous figures showed,? Li Deshui, the head of the statistics office, told reporters.

 The NBS now estimates that GDP in 2004 totalled 15.99 trillion yuan, 16.8 per cent more than its previous estimate.

 Using the end-2004 exchange rate of 8.276 yuan per dollar, that comes to $1.93 trillion, compared with $1.67 trillion for Italy, according to World Bank figures.

 Fast-growing service industries such as telecommunications, retailing and real estate accounted for 93 per cent of the revision and boosted the service sectors share of economic output in 2004 to 40.7 per cent from 31.9 per cent.

 Industrys hitherto outsized share of GDP dropped to 46.2 per cent from 52.9 per cent, while the share taken by farming and fisheries shrank to 13.1 per cent from 15.2 per cent.

 Foreign pressure

 The changes mean China will need to lean less on ever-faster industrial output, and the ever-rising demand for energy and raw materials it entails, to sustain the 9 per cent-plus GDP growth rates of the past three years.

 ?Given that the size of the services sector is much bigger than estimated, the sustainability of growth in China is much better than many people thought,? said Frank Gong, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase in Hong Kong.

 Because policy makers now know that growth is less reliant on export-orientated industries, they could be more relaxed about letting the yuan rise, which would favour consumption and services growth, Gong said.

 ?It will ease further some of the concerns within China on a strong yuan,? he said.

 Jim Walker of CLSA in Hong Kong said the fact that China is now almost certainly the fourth-biggest economy could raise hackles in Washington, where US Senator Charles Schumer is threatening to reintroduce a bill that would impose a 27.5 per cent tariff on Chinese imports unless the yuan is revalued.

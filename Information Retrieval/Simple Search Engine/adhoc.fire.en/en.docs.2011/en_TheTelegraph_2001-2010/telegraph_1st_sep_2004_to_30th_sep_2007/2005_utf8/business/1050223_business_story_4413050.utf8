 Clean fuel imports pumped up

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: Cleaner fuels will come at a high cost: $600 million a month.

 Oil companies are scrambling to import clean fuels to meet the April 1 deadline to comply with Euro III emission standards in 11 major cities.

 The imports have become essential as the oil companies have not been able to carry out the necessary adjustments at their refineries to meet the entire demand.

 Although national oil companies require 3 million tonnes of clean fuels, only half this amount is currently being produced, which requires imports of another 1.5 million tonnes.

 Senior Indian Oil Corporation officials said some of the public sector refineries will complete their modernisation soon and start producing more of these fuels. As a result, the quantity of imports would gradually come down.

 However, dependence on imports is expected to continue at least till September or even October when the Jamnagar refinery of Reliance Industries is likely to start producing these fuels. The refinery has been hit by technical snag and therefore, cannot produce these fuels at present.

 The petroleum ministry has asked the oil companies to start working towards meeting the goals set by the deadline in terms of Euro III fuels in 11 major cities and Euro II norms for the rest of the country. It wants to convey to the Supreme Court that the government is serious about implementing the decision.

 Senior officials feel that this would help the government avoid embarrassing strictures from the Supreme Court and get an extension for the deadline. This, in turn, would save valuable foreign exchange. 

 The countrys refining capacity had expanded to meet the entire demand of petrol and diesel in the country. In fact, there was some surplus production of the two fuels, which was being exported.

 Importing the two transport fuels will raise the surplus output by 1.5 million tonnes, which in turn will have to be exported at a lower price. The tankage and depots of the oil companies will have to be emptied in order to stock the new imports.

 Thus, any move to meet the Supreme Court deadline in toto can be implemented only at a heavy cost to the economy.

 The petroleum ministry has pulled up the public sector oil companies for expressing their inability to meet the April 1 deadline. It has pointed out that the deadline was fixed after consulting the oil companies.

 The public sector oil companies have made huge investments to upgrade the quality of their fuels but the project work has taken longer than expected. 

 According to the national auto fuel policy, drawn up following the intervention of the Supreme Court, the petrol and diesel supplied in 11 major cities has to be upgraded to Euro III levels, while for the rest of the country will have to be upgraded to Euro II levels by April 1.

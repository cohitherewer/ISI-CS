 New AIG chief sets agenda

 New York, March 15 (Reuters): The new chief executive of American International Group Inc is looking to settle quickly regulatory probes which forced the insurer?s board to shunt aside long-time chief Maurice ?Hank? Greenberg on Monday.

 AIG, the world?s largest insurer by market value, is under investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission and New York?s Attorney-General Eliot Spitzer into a reinsurance deal with a unit of Berkshire Hathaway that may have artificially boosted AIG?s balance sheet.

 Former AIG executives have also pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a probe by Spitzer into bid-rigging and fraud in the insurance industry. 

 ?The company is committed to co-operating with the governmental authorities in their ongoing investigations,? new AIG chief executive Martin Sullivan said.

 Rathi realty fund garners Rs 50 cr

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Skys the limit

 Calcutta, July 10: The recently launched Real Estate Opportunities Fund by the Anand Rathi Group has garnered a commitment money of Rs 50 crore from investors. The initial target of the realty investment fund has been set at Rs 500 crore.

 We have received very good response from the high net-worth individuals, said Anand Rathi, chairman of the group. 

 We have only taken a commitment money from investors. Once we sign up for real estate projects and start investing, we shall raise the rest, he added.

 The fund promoters exude confident of striking deals soon.

 We are getting proposals everyday. But no deal has so far been finalised, said Rathi who was in the city last week. Calcutta offers a huge opportunity in real estate development, he added.

 The Real Estate Opportunities Fund will only pick up equity stakes in realty projects and not provide any loan. It also aims to acquire rental income yielding properties.

 ICICI Bank, HDFC and Kotak have also lined up funds for investment in the countrys rising real estate sector.

 Calcutta builders, however, are sceptical if these funds would find takers in the local market.

 Pradip Chopra, secretary of the Bengal chapter of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (Credai), said, Bank finance is easily available nowadays. Funds are required when the projects are large in scale, like townships, he argued.

 Bengal, in particular, does not throw up such large-scale projects as of now constrained upon the governments land ceiling act.

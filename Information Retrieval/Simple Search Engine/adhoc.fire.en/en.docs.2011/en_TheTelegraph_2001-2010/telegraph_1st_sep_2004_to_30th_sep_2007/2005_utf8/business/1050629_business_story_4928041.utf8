 Stocks in 102-point cooler

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 28: Soaring markets lost some of their height today, the descent hastened by a Reliance board meeting that failed to send out widely-expected revamp signals.

 The sensex plunged 102 points to 7049, suffering one of the steepest declines since late April and slamming the brakes on a rally that has driven up stocks past the 7000-milestone.

 The market barometer opened at 7158.66 against Mondays close of 7151.08 and hit an intra-day high of 7175.15. It dived to a low of 7036.06 before closing at 7049.

 Reliance, Infosys and ITC played the drag devils, their shares taking the hardest hits and setting the pace for a larger selloff that did not even spare the mid-cap stocks. L amp;T, Ranbaxy, Tata Steel, Bhel, Tata Motors, Wipro, SBI, Hero Honda, ONGC and Satyam were also party-poopers. TCS, Bajaj Auto, Hindalco, ACC, HDFC and Bharti defied the market trend to end up in the positive zone.

 Brokers had expected the board meeting of Reliance to set a quicker pace of realigning the groups businesses after the settlement between the Ambani brothers. Upset investors pounded the firms shares to Rs 629.10. It had oscillated between Rs 652.00 and Rs 629.10. The other big worry was oil, whose prices flared up to $60.95 a barrel on Monday and fanned fears of a growth dip.

 Among other indices, the BSE-100 index fell 55.49 points to 3737.29 from 3792.78. The BSE-200 index and dollex-200 fell to 909.26 and 347.53 from 921.90 and 352.93 respectively.

 The sectoral indicators were not too different either. The BSE-metal index plunged 165.02 points to 5369.07, oil-gas index 69.60 points to 3359.71, small-cap index 85.09 points to 4333.86 and auto index 50.25 points to 2892.80.

 Turnover on Dalal Street dropped to Rs 2858.50 crore from Rs 3795.72 crore on Monday. Reliance Capital remained the turnover titan with a tally of Rs 477.54 crore, followed by Reliance Industries (Rs 236.45 crore), NDTV (Rs 139.70 cr), IPCL (Rs 82.42 cr) and SBI (Rs 78.12 cr).

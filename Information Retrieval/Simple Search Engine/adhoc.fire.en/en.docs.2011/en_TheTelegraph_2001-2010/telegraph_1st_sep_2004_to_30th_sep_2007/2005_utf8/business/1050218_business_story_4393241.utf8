 State Bank breathes life into merger

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Purwar: Thinking big

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: Moves are afoot to revive the biggest banking merger of them all: State Bank of India with its seven associate banks. 

 North Block has been seeking a clear policy to allow mergers of PSU banks and their right to acquire other banks in a bid to consolidate before multinational banks are allowed to spread their tentacles deeper into India, either through acquisitions or by organic growth.

 Top North Block mandarins have long been contemplating this mega merger but have also always been afraid that the merger might be too big to manage efficiently. 

 SBI chairman A.K.Purwar seemed to confirm rumours that the move is alive. He told newspersons on the sidelines of a conference here that the ?merger of SBI with its associates is not in the cold storage. We are moving in that direction. It will take some time.?

 Officials, however, say SBI has already started taking steps towards an eventual merger. It has gone ahead and integrated its technology platform with its associate banks. This could well be the first step towards a possible merger of the associate banks with SBI.

 The bank has put in place a common IT and ATM network and accounting system that will enable a smoother merger of associate banks with SBI once its receives formal approval from the government.

 The actual merger would require amendments to the SBI (Subsidiary Banks) Act, 1959, the SBI Act and approval from each of the seven states of the associate banks. 

 If and when the merger is clinched it will create the biggest banking monolith in South and Southeast Asia. With nearly 13,800 branches, the mega entity would control two fifths of all Indian banking businesses. 

 SBI is already the countrys largest bank with a marketshare of 19 per cent while the SBI group of seven associate banks has a marketshare of 25 per cent in deposits and advances. 

 The seven associate banks ? State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Indore, State Bank of Patiala, State Bank of Saurashtra, State Bank of Bikaner amp; Jaipur, State Bank of Travancore and State Bank of Mysore ? posted a net profit of Rs 1,407 crore for March 2003, while SBIs net profit was Rs 3,105 crore. 

 However, as most SBI associates have huge manpower pools, the new entity would have one of the lowest business to employee ratios. While private banks in India do about Rs 4.5 crore business per employee, the new entity would be able to show only Rs 1.54 crore per employee.

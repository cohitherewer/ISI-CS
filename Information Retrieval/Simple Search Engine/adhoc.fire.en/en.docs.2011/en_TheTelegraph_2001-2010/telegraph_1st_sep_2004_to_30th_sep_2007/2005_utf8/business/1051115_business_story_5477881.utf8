 Wal-Mart profit surges

 Chicago, Nov. 14 (Reuters): Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the worlds largest retailer, on Monday posted higher quarterly profit on strong sales.

 The company, which has vowed to cut prices aggressively and ramp up advertising this holiday season, said net income rose to $2.4 billion, or 57 cents per share, in the third quarter ended on October 31 from $2.3 billion, or 54 cents per share, a year earlier.

 Wal-Mart said last month that earnings would be between 55 cents and 59 cents per share, including 1 cent in costs for its hurricane relief efforts.

 The retailers shares are down about 7 per cent year-to-date amid concerns about slowing growth and a pile of lawsuits accusing the company of mistreating workers. By contrast, rival Target Corp. is up more than 12 per cent.

 Wal-Mart has also been grappling with steep energy prices that have raised transportation costs and hurt consumer spending among its core low-income shoppers, and it has responded by adding trendy clothing and houseware in the hope of attracting wealthier customers.

 China gears up to join global car race

 Speed is the key 

 Shanghai, April 16 (Reuters): After decades of riding global car makers? coat-tails and churning out clunky cars few wanted, upstart Chinese firms are flexing their muscles, designing sedans that threaten to engulf world markets. 

 Now, the likes of General Motors and Toyota Motor are getting increasingly nervous about the country?s vaunted export might, afraid that automotive history ? a la Japan and South Korea ? might repeat itself. 

 Analysts and industry executives call for calm. 

 The Chinese must first deal with poor-quality perceptions ? as even Nissan Motor once had to ? the higher cost of making cars there, endemic intellectual property theft and a serious lack of design savvy, they say. 

 ?I?m not sure whether it will take 10, 20 or 30 years, but it?s entirely possible that in future we will see Chinese-badged cars being driven on the streets of Japan,? said Katsumi Nakamura, president of Nissan?s Chinese venture. 

 ?They are very ambitious.?

 Indeed, executives convening at next week?s Shanghai auto show can expect to be greeted by a flurry of activity from China?s car makers: unveiling plans to make own-branded products, pushing cars onto a saturated world market, marketing blitzes. 

 Mainland car makers and foreign allies such as market leader Volkswagen AG have unveiled plans to spend more than $15 billion tripling capacity to over 7 million cars by 2008, sparking fears of a glut. 

 If China fails to become the world?s second-biggest car market by 2010, as McKinsey amp; Co. predicts, the country could suddenly find itself saddled with millions of unsold cars. 

 The idea of Geely or Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp, China?s top car maker, mimicking Toyota?s or Hyundai?s success is keeping industry chiefs up at night. 

 ?If you have all this capacity, you?ll have to consider going abroad,? said Yale Zhang at consultancy CSM. ?This is the route all Chinese companies are going to take, and car makers are no exception. Eventually the market will become saturated.?

Fuelling fears

 A market downturn is fuelling fears. After nearly doubling in 2003, car sales growth braked to just 15 per cent in 2004 and should grow at an even slower pace in 2005. 

 At the forefront of the burgeoning export push are two companies ? Geely, based in the eastern private enterprise hotbed of Zhejiang, and Chery Automobile Co., accused by GM of copying one of its cars ? a charge it denied. 

 Li Shufu, Geely?s ever-ebullient chairman, wants to sell two-thirds of output overseas, though he is coy on when that could happen. Geely hopes to produce 650,000 cars a year by 2007.

 10-minute show in UTV flotation

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 21: The script wasn?t any different for this IPO. UTV Software Communications saw the shares it had put on the block grabbed within 10 minutes.

 The TV show and film distributor aims to mop up around Rs 100 crore in an issue already oversubscribed more than two times. This is widely seen by market mavens as yet another evidence of the hunger for new stock.

 The way the 70 lakh shares, representing 34.11 per cent of UTV?s expanded equity, flew off the block reminded many about the Jet Airways flotation ? which romped home within minutes of its opening on Friday. 

 ?All bids have come at the top end of the price band,? an investment banker managing the UTV offer said. The range had been fixed between Rs 115-130 per share. The offer is expected to raise Rs 91 crore if the issue price is Rs 115. This will put the firm?s valuation at Rs 267 crore. 

 Like most flotations in recent times, it was the institutions which rushed their bids today. Primary market watchers believe both foreign and local institutions are keen on a slice of the UTV issue. Retail investors are expected to apply in the last few days of the offer.

 Investment bankers say even the Jet flotation has been oversubscribed close to seven times now. This happened despite gripes that the price was too high. Many brokers say enquiries for financing the new issues come in thick and fast as the issue draws to a close.

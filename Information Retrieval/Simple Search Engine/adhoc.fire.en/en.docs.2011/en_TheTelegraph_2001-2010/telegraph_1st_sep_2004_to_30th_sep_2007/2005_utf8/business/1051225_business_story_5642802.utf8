 Google fuels hopes of America Online IPO

 San Francisco, Dec. 24 (AP): Googles $1 billion investment in America Online could lead to an initial public offering in 2008. Industry watchers believe that this will give the online search engine leader and AOL parent Time Warner an opportunity to capitalise on an Internet advertising boom that they hope to fuel through their partnership.

 The possible timeline for an initial public offering by AOL emerged with its yesterdays filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 The documents provide additional details about a deal announced earlier this week that extends the business ties which Google and AOL formed when they began working together in 2002.

 Although Google will hold only a 5 per cent stake in AOL, it retains the right to demand an IPO beginning in July 2008, according to the SEC documents. If Time Warner doesnt want to pursue a public issue then it could buy back Googles stake based on a fair market value, the document says.

 AOLs instant messaging service will become compatible with Googles service next year, but Googles users will have to register with AOL.

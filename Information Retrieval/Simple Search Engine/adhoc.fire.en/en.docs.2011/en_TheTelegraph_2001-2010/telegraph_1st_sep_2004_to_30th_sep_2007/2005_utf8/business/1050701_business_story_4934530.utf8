 BankAm buys MBNA

 New York, June 30 (Reuters): Bank of America Corp, the No. 2 US bank, today said it agreed to buy MBNA Corp for about $35 billion in cash and stock, doubling the banks credit card business.

 The combined company will have about $143 billion in card balances and 40 million active accounts, with Bank of America adding more than 20 million new accounts.

 The transaction values MBNA at $27.50 per share, which represents a premium of 30.6 per cent to the MBNA closing share price of $21.05 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

 I think its a perfect fit, said Ted Parrish, who manages the $1-billion Henssler Equity Fund and owns MBNA and Bank of America shares. For Bank of America, it was the only big deal left for them to do.

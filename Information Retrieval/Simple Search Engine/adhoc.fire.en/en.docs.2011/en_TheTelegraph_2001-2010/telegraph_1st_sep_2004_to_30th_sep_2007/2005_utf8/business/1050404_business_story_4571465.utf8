 Bhilai Steel sees profit leap

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Singh: Upbeat

 Bhilai, April 3: Steel Authority of India?s Bhilai Steel Plant is set to earn a profit of more than Rs 3,000 crore for the first time, overcoming early setbacks due to shortage of coal, an important ingredient for the steel industry.

 The unit, which heavily depends upon imported coal, had encountered an erratic supply of the fuel in the first two quarters of 2004-05. Around 80 per cent of Bhilai Steel?s coal requirement is met from abroad.

 R. P. Singh, managing director of Bhilai Steel, said the impact of coking coal was to the tune of Rs 1,400 crore on this unit alone.

 Coal prices have gone up to $126 a tonne from $57 a tonne (free-on-board) last April.

 Notwithstanding the coal shortage triggered by defaults in the delivery of Australian companies, the unit produced more crude steel than hot metal during the last fiscal.

 Bhilai Steel churned out 4.58 million tonnes (MT) of crude steel compared to 4.51 MT of hot metal in 2004-05. However, both hot metal and crude steel productions were down from the previous year. 

 By using innovative technology, the unit stepped up saleable steel production to 4.09 MT from 3.93 MT recorded in 2003-04.

 Singh attributed the profitability of the company to an improved product mix. Value-added products contribute 34.5 per cent of the total saleable steel. Production of finished steel component has increased to 81.3 per cent from 73.7 per cent of the total saleable steel.

 ?We reduced the production of semis and intermediates and concentrated on value-added products,? Singh said.

 Last year, Bhilai Steel recorded a profit of Rs 1,932 crore on a turnover of Rs 8,850 crore. This year the turnover will cross Rs 10,000 crore.

 According to the company?s roadmap up to 2006-07, hot-metal output is expected to go up to 5.45 MT, crude steel up to 4.95 MT and saleable steel up to 4.25 MT. Finished steel production is expected to be 74 per cent of the saleable steel.

 According to the corporate plan drawn by SAIL, the steel major intends to increase hot-metal production to 20 MT by 2011-12. Out of this, Bhilai Steel will make 7 MT of hot metal, 6.7 MT crude steel and 6.21 MT of saleable steel. By this time, finished steel will contribute 92 per cent of Bhilai Steel?s saleable steel.

 SAIL?s corporate plan has earmarked Rs 12,500 crore investment for Bhilai Steel.

 However, the entire expansion project depends on whether SAIL gets the control over Rowghat mines in Chattisgarh where Bhilai Steel is located. ?It is absolutely vital to get the lease of Rowghat mines for the long-term survival of Bhilai Steel,? Singh said.

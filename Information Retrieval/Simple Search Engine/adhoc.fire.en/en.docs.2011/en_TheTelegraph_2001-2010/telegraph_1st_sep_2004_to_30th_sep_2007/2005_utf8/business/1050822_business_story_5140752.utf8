 ONGC to sell aviation fuel

 Calcutta, Aug. 21 (PTI): The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, which has obtained the approval from the Centre for marketing aviation turbine fuel and refuelling at airports 10 days ago, would start marketing its own air fuel from 2006-07, said Subir Raha, chairman, ONGC.

 The company has decided to market the product under the brand Oval Air Fuel, he added.

 ONGC plans to produce and sell 20,000 kilolitres of aviation turbine fuel from its Hazira unit in Gujarat.

 To start with, we will market the fuel at Juhu for captive use of refuelling our chartered helicopters used for offshore operations, which was earlier being done by Indian Oil Corporation, Raha said on the sidelines of an award-giving function for Bengali Advertisement and Marketing Agencies here last night.

 New Delhi, Dec. 29: The Union cabinet today approved proposals to amend the Forward Contracts (Regulations) Act of 1952 and cleared the taxation laws (amendment) bill to protect the interests of donors.

 Separate bills to amend the forwards contracts act will be introduced during the budget session of Parliament, said finance minister P. Chidambaram.

 The cabinet has approved interim measures for forward markets till such time the legislation comes into effect, he said. The interim measures will be brought in through an order.

 The proposed amendments and interim measures will strengthen the Forward Markets Commission and effectively regulate and develop the commodity futures market, he said. 

 The cabinet has approved amendments to clause 5 and insertion of clauses 5a, 5b and 8a in the Taxation Laws Bill 2005 to amend sections 35, 35ac, 35cca and section 80gga of the Income Tax Act, 1961. This will protect donors in the event of withdrawal of approval of the donee entities, programmes, projects or schemes.

 The bill proposes to ensure that deductions to the donor will not be denied on the ground that subsequent to the donation, approval granted to the donee entities was withdrawn.

 The cabinet has also approved the proposal to drop clause 37 of the bill as a separate Central Sales Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2005. 

 It has also cleared a proposal to amend the Government Securities Bill 2004, which will be introduced in Parliament.

 When politics beats economics 

 JEHANGIR S. POCHA 

 Beijing, July 22: Chinas decision to re-value its currency by 2 per cent and scrap its peg to the US dollar in favour of a basket of currencies is sending rumbles through the global financial system. 

 Despite Beijings attempts to position its move as an accommodation of the US concerns that an undervalued renminbi (RMB) ? the Chinese currency ? was costing US jobs and fuelling a rising trade deficit, critics say the revaluation will do little to materially change economic ground realities. 

 (Two per cent) is too small to make a difference to trade or capital flows, said Arthur Kroeber, managing editor of the China Economic Quarterly, a research and analysis firm in Beijing. But it was never the goal of the Chinese policy to correct external imbalances by a revaluation. The long-term goal is a crawling peg delivering some appreciation against the dollar, but this goal will be realised over 20 years or so. Those expecting further upward revaluation in the RMB in the near term will be disappointed. 

 Beijings intent seems to have been more directed towards the political aspects of the RMBs revaluation than the economic ones. Over the last one year, demands that Beijing re-value the RMB have been loudly stated by the US, Japanese and European legislators, who blamed cheap Chinese exports for the growing domestic job losses and a collective trade deficit with China of more than $285 billion. The harshest critics of Chinas currency policy had been demanding that Beijing should re-value the RMB by as much as 30 per cent, or allow its currency to float freely with the market determining its value. 

 Kroeber said the timing of Chinas revaluation seems to have accounted skilfully for these political realities. Chinese President Hu Jintao is set to visit the US in September. Now he will be able to argue that China has made its currency more flexible and thus done its part in mitigating the huge US trade deficit with China, Kroeber said. 

 Politically, the move enables the Bush Administration to declare victory in its two-year campaign of quiet persuasion on the currency issue. Congressional firebrands will probably denounce the move as insufficient, but in practical terms the wind has been taken out of the sails of the China-as-currency-manipulator argument. 

 But in the long run, the biggest impact of Chinas move on global financial system will be that several other nations could follow its lead replacing their currencies peg to the US dollar and putting them against a basket of currencies. 

 The Chinese move is significant because it signals a major change in the currency regime in China and, soon enough, throughout Asia, Nouriel Roubini, a former US Treasury economist told Bloomberg. 

 Currently, 32 other countries, including Saudi Arabia, Ecuador and Hong Kong, have their currency pegged to a single currency, principally the US dollar, according to the International Monetary Fund. 

 Already one of them, Malaysia, announced it was ending its seven-year-old peg to the US dollar and moving to a managed float just hours after China made its announcement. 

 The effect of that could be serious for the US if it leads China and those who follow it to reduce their purchases of the US government securities they previously bought to maintain the currencies values. Those purchases also served to keep US interest rates low, thereby reducing the cost of the US governments deficit.

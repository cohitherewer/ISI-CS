 Use plastic to pay bills, but...

 Credit card issuers are offering to pay your utility bills. Srikumar Banerjee checks it out

 Convenience comes with a cost. But then, Chinmoy Sengupta, like many of his neighbours, wouldn?t mind paying a local paanwala Rs 10 extra every month for depositing his electricity bill. 

 ?It?s money well spent. It ends the hassle of queueing up and saves me the loss of a day?s work,? reasons Sengupta. ?Its a hell of a task if you have to do it yourself. Then, you will have to pay a penalty if the bill is not paid within the due date.? 

 However, Senguptas worry doesnt end until the paanwala hands him the acknowledgement receipt as proof of the payment. 

 This arrangement would have continued hadn?t Sengupta received a call from his credit card issuer a week ago offering him the facility to pay his utility bills through his plastic card. 

 ?They told me that my utility bills every month will be paid automatically through my credit card and I shall get 20 days? time from the issue of the credit card statement to repay the amount without any interest on the credit. After that, the bank will charge me a 2.95 per cent interest on the credit outstanding on a monthly basis,? says he.

 Sengupta is tempted: should he sign up for the offer? 

 A close look at it reveals there are more cons than pros.

 The credit card issuing bank has tieups with some utility service providers for bill payments. The name of these service providers is well advertised by the bank. What a credit cardholder of the bank should do is to check out first whether his utility service provider and his city feature on the bank?s list. In most cases, you won?t find an individual bank that lists all your utility service providers. 

 If it does, then approach the utility with a photocopy of your credit card for a standing instruction form allowing it to collect the payment from the bank against your credit card.

 You will also have to sign a similar form allowing the bank to debit the bill amount from your credit card account.

 Once the bank pays the bills to the utility, it adds the amount to the credit outstanding on the card, which is shown in the monthly statement. However, you get a free credit period within which you can repay the amount without any interest. Different banks offer different credit revolving period. 

 But, if one fails to make the payment within this period, the bank charges a monthly interest (2.5-2.95 per cent) from the date it has paid the bills to the utility service providers. 

 For example, your total monthly utility bill is Rs 3,000, say, and the payment falls due on the tenth day of every month. The bank will pay the amount to your utility service providers on the tenth and send you the credit card statement on the 15th along with your other credit purchase details. If you get a credit revolving period of 20 days, you will have to pay by the fifth day of the following month. If you fail to make the payment on or before that date, you will have to pay an interest of about Rs 75 for paying it on the sixth day. The interest amount increases as the payment gets delayed. That is the twist in the tail. 

 Moreover, in case of an excess billing, there is little room to stop the payment before the dispute is settled. 

 Has Sengupta any other relief for his bill payment blues? Yes, and he found it with his good old public sector bank itself ? the Electronic Clearing Service of the Reserve Bank.

 All PSU banks offer this absolutely free. Utilities are also lapping up this opportunity. Some like Calcutta Telephones give a 1 per cent rebate if paid through ECS.

 Stocks swerve on US rate curve 

 There?s an inverse relationship between the sensex and US long-term bond yields. 

 Is the bull run over? The fall in the sensex from its high of 8821 reached on October 5 is remarkably similar to its behaviour in March-April this year. This time, the fall in the sensex has been around 1100 points or so. Earlier, the benchmark index fell from a high of 6954 reached on March 9 to a low of 6118 on April 18, a drop of 836 points. In percentage terms, the drop was 12 per cent in April, and it?s around 12 per cent this time ? at least till now.

 Also, during both March/April and now, the yield on the US ten-year Treasury note went up beyond 4.5 per cent. While the yield went up to 4.59 per cent last Wednesday, it was at 4.59 per cent during the week ended March 25. At other times, the yield has been lower, even going down below 4 per cent in early June.

 The remarkable inverse correlation between the Indian stock market and US bond yields is a reflection of the fact that the rise in the market over the last two-and-a-half years is largely due to foreign funds flowing in. When bond yields rise in the US, some of it flows back, and the stock market drops. Also, if long-term interest rates rise too much, the US mortgage market could be hit. That?s because home prices and easy mortgages have been a potent addition to the ?feel good? factor among US consumers, and higher interest rates could hurt consumer demand. 

 Analysts have been surprised that fund flows to emerging markets have remained strong in spite of the rise in the Federal Funds Rate from 1 per cent to 3.75 per cent. However, that?s probably because although short-term rates in the US have gone up, long-term rates, like the yield on the 10-year note, have not. So, whenever the long-term rate goes up, as it has now and as it did in April, all emerging markets get the jitters.

 Consider also that the US 10-year note yield went up to 4.8 per cent during the week to May 14, 2004. It was shortly thereafter that there was a major sell-off in emerging markets. In India, the markets tottered on May 17 last year, the ostensible reason being the election of the UPA government, but all emerging markets too were affected. 

 Perhaps, tracking the US 10-year bond yield could be one way of predicting the sensex.

 Mutual funds buy

 The other parallel with March/April is that domestic mutual funds turned buyers at that time, just as they are buyers now, and they supported the market while foreign institutional investors sold. This time, too, the same thing seems to be happening. 

 The table shows that FIIs sold a net Rs 1,794.2 crore worth of equities in April and May, while mutual funds bought a net Rs 4,805.02 crore worth of stocks during those months. 

 In August and September, both FIIs and MFs bought into the market, which explains the dizzying rise in these months. 

 Till October 26, MFs bought a net Rs 2,267.50 crore, while FIIs sold a net Rs 2,278.77 crore. Notice that the amount sold by FIIs is almost the same as that bought by MFs. 

 The rise in MF buying, of course, has been fuelled by inflows into growth schemes of mutual funds, mostly in new schemes. Unfortunately, the retail investor usually enters the market at its top. The inflows into equity funds, therefore, may be another indicator that the two-and-a-half-year rally is behind us.

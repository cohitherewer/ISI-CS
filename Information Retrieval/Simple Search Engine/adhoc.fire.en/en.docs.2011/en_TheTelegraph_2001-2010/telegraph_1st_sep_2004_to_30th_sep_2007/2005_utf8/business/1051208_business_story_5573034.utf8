 Healthy rise in infotech spend

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 7: Gartner, the leading IT research firm, has projected that total Indian enterprise IT spending, including hardware, software, telecommunications and IT services, will reach Rs 1,09,300 crore in 2006. It will grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 21 per cent over the next five years till 2009. This, however, excludes consumer IT spending.

 Announcing the Top Ten Trends and Predictions for 2006, Gartner said India can expect the annual enterprise ICT spending to grow at 23 per cent in 2006. About Rs 73,900 crore will be spent on telecommunication services and equipment (up 27 per cent over 2005), Rs 17,200 crore on hardware (a 13 per cent rise), Rs 14,100 crore on IT services (a 22 per cent increase) and Rs 4,100 crore on software, which is up 17 per cent.

 Predicting that between 2006 and 2012 the majority of new technologies adopted by enterprises will have their roots in the consumer market, Dion Wiggins, vice-president and research director at Gartner, said, Many technologies have been introduced in the past and accepted in consumer markets, only to be ignored by enterprises.

 Gartner has also forecast that IT development in China will mature fast. Trade between India and China is likely to explode. As a result, firms will gain competency that can be applied in other emerging markets.

 According to Gartner, IT development is coming of age in Asia-Pacific and Asian firms will be in the forefront of consumer technology, mobile and broadband content and associated business models. However, the region is forecast to lag in the development of enterprise applications. Gartner also feels open source software will compete directly with commercial software the enterprise market and take on an expanded role in the small-to-medium business sector.

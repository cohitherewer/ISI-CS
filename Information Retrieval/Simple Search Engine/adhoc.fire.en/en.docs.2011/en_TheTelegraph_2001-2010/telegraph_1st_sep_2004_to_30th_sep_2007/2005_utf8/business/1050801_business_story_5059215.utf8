 Par for the course

 Investors have trouble with simple financial terms. Chandralekha Tulal checks out one

 When you have trouble with a phrase or a word, you scurry to a dictionary and look up its meaning. But what do you do when the same word or phrase can mean something totally different, depending on the context in which it is used?

 Here?s one we have picked out: ?at par?. The term is one of the most misleading phrases in the lexicon of mutual funds.

 Unlike a company?s stock price, a mutual fund is always sold at the same value of the underlying assets. 

 Suppose you buy a share at the face value of Rs 10, it represents the intrinsic value of the stock. However, when you pay Rs 10 for a mutual fund unit, it is not just the face value of the unit but the total value of the shares that can be bought with that money.

 However, the tragic truth is that most investors still confuse a mutual funds net asset value (NAV) with stock prices and try to gauge whether it is overvalued or undervalued just as they do with actual stock prices.

 Rathin Mitra baulked at the thought of investing in a 10-year old mutual fund scheme whose NAV hovered around Rs 50. Although his friend tried to convince him otherwise, he insisted on investing in a new fund offer where he could buy the units at Rs 10.

 ?Returns in percentage are what matters,? says Bobby Surendranath, vice-president (equities), Standard Chartered Mutual Fund.

 Let us assume that the fund managers are equally competent and, over a period of a year, market value of the portfolios increase by 50 per cent, the Rs 10 NAV would rule at Rs 15 and the Rs 50 NAV will hit Rs 75. 

 So, now would you choose the first scheme over the latter? No, you would be indifferent as the percentage growth for both is exactly the same, though one has is at face value, while the other has a NAV that is five times higher.

 Rathin is still not convinced. ?I want to opt for the dividend option. If I invest Rs 50,000 at Rs 50, I would receive just 1,000 units, while at Rs 10, I will get 5,000 units. So tell me now if both funds declare a dividend of 10 per cent, where will I get a higher return? quot; 

 The dividend paid, explains his friend, is no indication of returns generated by the fund. It is paid out of the NAV; the undistributed surplus forms a part of the capital and the fund being a trust belongs to the investors. 

 Although, in actual terms you will get more money from the second fund, how can you be sure that both funds will declare dividends of 10 per cent? The first fund, which has high-accumulated surplus will be in a better and easier position to declare higher dividends, both in quantum and in periodicity. Another concern voiced by Rathin is that a high NAV pushes the dividend yield down. Yes, indeed this is true on paper but not in practice. 

 Here again, one should judge the returns on one?s investments on a total outflow-inflow basis. The dividend is just one of the components of the inflow, the other one being the (appreciated) capital itself. 

 Explains Dhirendra Kumar, chief executive of Value Research, ?One can always book profits at one?s convenience and after the returns target is met. In my opinion, it is much more convenient and desirable for investors to withdraw money according to the requirement rather than waiting for the fund house to declare a dividend.? 

 In a nutshell, if you want to make mutual fund investment to work for you, look for consistent returns across various schemes over the last three to five years and not at the NAVs. 

 Says Kumar, ?If at all, it is the latter ? high NAV scheme with other things remaining equal ? may be a better investment on account of the demonstrated competence.?

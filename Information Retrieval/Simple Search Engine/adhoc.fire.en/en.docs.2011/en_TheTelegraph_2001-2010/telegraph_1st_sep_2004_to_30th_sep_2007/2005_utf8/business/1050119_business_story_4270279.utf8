 HPCL focus on Punjab refinery

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Lal: Geared up

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) will resume work on its stalled Rs 10,000-crore Punjab refinery project soon, chairman M. B. Lal said today. 

 Lal said he expected the state governments approval for tax concessions to come through any time now and work on the project at Bhatinda would start immediately afterwards.

 HPCL has already acquired land for the refinery and developed the site but work had come to a standstill after the Congress government, which came to power two years ago, said it would not approve tax concessions cleared by the earlier Akali Dal regime.

 Punjab chief minister Amrinder Singh said the tax concessions would cause a huge drain on the revenues of the state, which it could not afford.

 HPCL had found itself in a dilemma as refusal to grant the sales tax waiver on the lines that the Gujarat government has extended to Reliance Industries Jamnagar refinery, would have rendered the Punjab refinery unviable. 

 HPCL is short of refining capacity to feed its retail network in the northern region and is keen to build the refinery. The company had been running from pillar to post but the new government in Punjab had refused to budge.

 The company had then been toying with the idea of picking up a stake in the IOCs Panipat refinery and Bharat Petroleums proposed Bina refinery.

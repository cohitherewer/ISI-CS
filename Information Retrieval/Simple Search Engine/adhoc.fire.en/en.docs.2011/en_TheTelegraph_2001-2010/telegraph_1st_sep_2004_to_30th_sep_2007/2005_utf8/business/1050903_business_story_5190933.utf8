 Rajasthan to doll up for tourists

 GARIMA SINGH

 Scindia: Guiding force

 Jaipur, Sept 2: Rajasthan ? the state that draws foreign tourists by the droves to savour the splendour of royalty and magnificent tales of valour and chivalry that lurk in the shadows of its majestic forts ? is looking to break out of a time warp.

 Chief minister Vasundhara Raje Scindia, whose royal lineage is as blue-blooded as any in this desert state of maharajahs, is drawing up a policy package to boost tourism in the state that focuses on some noveau and mundane aspects of everyday tourism: eco, rural and health tourism.

 These are the neo-totems of tourism that are almost alien to the desert state, which is a key vertex in the so-called Golden Triangle that represents the El Dorado of tourism in India.

 One foreign tourist in every four that come to India hot foots it to the burning sands of Rajasthan to gape and marvel at a society that remains steeped in royal tradition and ritual.

 But this is exactly the problem because Scindia is only too acutely aware that the states biggest selling point is also its worst straitjacket: it leaves Rajasthan ossified in some timeless past and refuses to let it transform itself into a vibrant hub of growth and development.

 So, Raje is cobbling a policy package that seeks to mesh its heritage tourism infrastructure with the demands of eco, rural and health tourism.

 Kicking off a two-day national conference on tourism here today, she spoke of the need to encourage public-private partnership and take initiatives to beef up infrastructure facilities. The conference has been jointly organised by the Rajasthan government and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci). The policy package ? which is still being sculpted ? seeks to stem Rajasthans falling share in the countrys tourism pie measured in terms of overall growth and the total number of tourist arrivals in recent years.

 The contours of the new policy includes ways to increase the number of hotel rooms by establishing land banks, declassifying land for hotels from commercial to the industrial category, creation of a district-wise inventory of tourism circuits, special desert tourism projects, and fillip to rural, eco and health tourism projects. The first step, said Raje, was to improve international air connectivity with Rajasthan. It is imperative for the Centre to announce Jaipur as an international airport in order to make it a new hub for overseas travellers, she added.

 She said 25 smaller airports in the state would be upgraded by expanding the airstrips to 6,000 feet. This would allow larger aircraft to land at these airports.

 The Rajasthan government is also working on a range of projects that will support development of a sports city, heritage properties, and conversion and maintenance of state rest houses and forest rest houses to increase the availability of rooms.

 The hospitality industry had a wishlist that it presented to Raje. It wanted Rajes government to grant industry status to the hotel sector. This will enable them to get land at rates which are at par with industrial projects, said Lalit Suri, chairman of Bharat Hotels.

 The industry also called for clear titles on land offered to the private sector, creation of land banks, and tax holiday for new hotels to bridge the huge deficit in the availability of rooms for tourists.

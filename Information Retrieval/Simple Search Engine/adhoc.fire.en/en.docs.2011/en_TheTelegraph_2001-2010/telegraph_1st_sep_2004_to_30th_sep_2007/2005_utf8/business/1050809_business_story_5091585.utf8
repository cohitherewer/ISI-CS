 Cisco keen to take Nokia call

 In demand

 London, Aug. 8 (Reuters): Cisco Systems Inc is considering buying the worlds top mobile handset maker Nokia in a bid to gain its wireless infrastructure technology, the Business newspaper reported on Sunday.

 The paper, which did not reveal the source of its information, said US-based Cisco had traditionally concentrated on acquisitions of niche technology players, but its CEO John Chambers is believed to be interested in merging with a wireless infrastructure firm. Nokia has been identified as the most likely target, the paper said.

 Cisco, the largest maker of Internet equipment, is worth around $123 billion, while Nokias market value is around $71 billion.

 The paper said Ciscos mainstay networking market was fast changing with the convergence of fixed-line and wireless networks, and Cisco needed a merger to acquire the technology to create intelligent wireless applications, which Finnish-based Nokia could provide.

 Cisco declined to comment. A Nokia spokeswoman in Helsinki also declined to comment.

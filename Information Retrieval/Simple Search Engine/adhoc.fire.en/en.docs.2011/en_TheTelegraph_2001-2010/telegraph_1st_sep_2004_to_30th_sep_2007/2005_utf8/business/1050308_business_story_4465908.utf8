 Proposed RBI norms make ING Vysya edgy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 7: ING Vysya Bank has said if the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines on ownership in private sector banks are accepted, implementation of its business plan and growth strategy would be adversely impacted.

 In July last year, the central bank had circulated a draft of a comprehensive policy framework for ownership and governance in private sector banks. The guidelines would force many promoters in these banks to bring their shareholding to 10 per cent.

 The RBI said in the interest of diversified ownership of banks, the objective of the legal framework would be to ensure that no single entity or a group of related entities has shareholding or control in excess of 10 per cent of the paid-up capital unless approved by the central bank. 

 The RBI has also reiterated the diversification of ownership in its roadmap for foreign banks? ownership in private sector counterparts. 

 ING Vysya Bank is coming out with a rights issue of 6.82 crore shares at a price of Rs 45 apiece aggregating Rs 307 crore. Three shares will be issued for every piece held.

 In the offer letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for the rights issue, ING Vysya Bank said its promoters hold 44.12 per cent of its pre-issue equity. ?If the draft comprehensive policy framework becomes law, they may have to dispose of the shares held by them and this may adversely impact the implementation of our business plan and our growth strategy,? it added.

 ING Vysya Bank also said its promoters may be required to reduce their shareholding in a short timeframe and offload it in the stock market. ?This may have an immediate impact on our shareholding pattern and potentially on the market price of our shares,? it added.

 ING Bank N. V., which is the promoter of ING Vysya Bank, is a 100 per cent subsidiary of ING Groep N. V.

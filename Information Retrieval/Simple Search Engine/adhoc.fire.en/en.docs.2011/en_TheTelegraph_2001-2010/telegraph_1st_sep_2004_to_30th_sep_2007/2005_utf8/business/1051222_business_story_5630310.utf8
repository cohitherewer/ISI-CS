 Nasscom seeks BPO tax parity

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 THE CUBICLES WILL BE HUMMING MORE IF THE TAXMAN OBLIGES

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: The National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) has urged the finance ministry to bring the tax liability for the work transferred by foreign firms to their Indian arms on a par with that outsourced to a standalone BPO unit here.

 To boost the prospects of the BPO industry as well as remove the concerns of companies willing to outsource work to India, Nasscom has sought amendments to the Income Tax Act. The apex body wants the arms length price for outsourced work to be determined only on the basis of the activities performed by the IT-enabled BPO unit in India without attributing any profits to the non-resident outsourcing such work to India. The non-resident should not be liable to tax in India for such work outsourced.

 Sunil Mehata, a senior official with Nasscom, said, Arms length treatment means that if a foreign company has outsourced work to its subsidiary in India, it should be treated on a par with similar work outsourced to any BPO company in the country.

 Currently, Indian taxation law differentiates between foreign companies operating in India and firms registered in the country, even if they are foreign-owned. Branches of foreign companies attract a slightly higher tax compared with Indian firms.

 In a letter to the finance ministry, Nasscom has said, In the domestic BPO industry, predominant employment and revenue generation is by captive units of overseas MNCs (nearly 65 per cent). These MNCs, at the corporate level, definitely have concerns about possible interpretations that may make the parent liable to tax and/or require the parent company to file returns here and open its books to Indian tax authorities.

 These worries have, in some cases, delayed or put on hold the transfer of more work to India. Such apprehensions may cause the loss of opportunity of further growth in the existing or new centres in India, said Nasscom.

 Moreover, MNCs have multiple locations from where work can move to India. Nasscom has pointed out that if such movements can allegedly create a tax burden on multiple overseas entities, it becomes a serious bottleneck.

 We estimate that if the above clarifications are issued, India will gain a sizeable additional revenue; if not, we lose up to $1 billion in revenues and a sizeable employment generation, Nasscom said.

 The software association has also urged the government to keep expenses related to sales and promotion activities, meals and medical insurance out of the ambit of the fringe benefit tax.

 The FBT should be applicable on such expenses, which have direct nexus with the employees. Also, the need for a separate return and assessment proceedings should be dispensed with, quot; Nasscom said in its pre-budget memorandum.

 It has also demanded that the firms that have paid tax outside India should get credit for it while calculating their liability in India.

 If foreign tax credit is not allowed, then the government should allow the same as an admissible deduction from taxable profits, Nasscom said.

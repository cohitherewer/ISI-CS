 Hindalco earnings climb

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 29: Hindalco Industries Ltd, an Aditya Birla group company, has recorded a 35 per cent rise in its bottomline for the third quarter of the current financial year. Net profit of the non-ferrous metals major jumped to Rs 114.6 crore compared with Rs 84.8 crore in the corresponding previous period.

 The healthy growth in earnings came on the back of a good show put up by Hindalco?s copper and aluminium businesses. Net sales for the reporting quarter rose 23 per cent to Rs 2,044.9 crore from Rs 1,662.8 crore in the year-ago period.

 The net profit for the nine-month ended December 31, 2004 was reported at Rs 710.5 crore compared with Rs 616.7 crore in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal. Net sales increased to Rs 5,766.1 crore during the nine-month ended December 31, 2004 against Rs 4303.5 crore over the corresponding period of the last fiscal.

 According to Hindalco, the copper business of the company recorded a net sales of Rs 1,143.2 crore (Rs 901.6 crore), reflecting a 27 per cent growth. Higher international prices and a modest volume growth of 3 per cent helped the company to shore up its topline. However, margins fell as realisations came down due to a steep duty reduction of 10 per cent, removal of export incentives and higher prices of inputs, including coal.

 The aluminium business contributed Rs 901.7 crore to Hindalco?s topline, an 18 per cent increase over Rs 761.2 crore in the same period last year. Here, the company said higher volumes, improved realisations, a shift in the market mix in favour of higher domestic sales and a continued thrust on value-added products were the key drivers.

 Hindalco is now engaged in doubling the copper smelter capacity at Dahej to 5 lakh tonnes from 2.5 lakh tonnes.

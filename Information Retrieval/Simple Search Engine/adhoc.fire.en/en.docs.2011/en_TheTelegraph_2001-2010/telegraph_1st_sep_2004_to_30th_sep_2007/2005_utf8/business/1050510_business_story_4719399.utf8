 Dynegy first quarter earnings dip

 Houston, May 9 (Reuters): Electricity wholesaler Dynegy Corp on Monday posted a first-quarter loss, hurt by costs related to the settlement of a class-action shareholder lawsuit and a restructuring.

 Dynegy also said it was considering divesting its midstream natural gas business and had hired Credit Suisse First Boston to review its strategic options for the unit.

 The Houston-based company, which has struggled since the collapse of the merchant energy sector three years ago, posted a net loss of $267 million, or 70 cents per share, versus net income of $65 million, or 14 cent per share, in the year-ago period. 

 Dynegy was hit by $265 million in costs in the quarter, including a $156 million to settle the shareholder lawsuit and $109 million to restructure a money-losing power supply contract.

 The company said those charges would push its expected net loss for the year to $395 million to $410 million, versus its previously announced guidance of a loss of $319 million to $335 million.

 However, full-year losses from its core businesses would be smaller, Dynegy said, with net loss from core businesses were now expected at $130 million to $145 million, compared with its previous guidance for a loss of $183 million to $199 million.

 That improvement was largely due to higher power and commodity prices, the company said.

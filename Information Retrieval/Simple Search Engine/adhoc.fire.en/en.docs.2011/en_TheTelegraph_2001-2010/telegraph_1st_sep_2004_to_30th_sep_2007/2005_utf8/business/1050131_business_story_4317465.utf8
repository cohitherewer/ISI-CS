 Q amp;A

 I am 57 years of age and had opted for VRS in 2003. I wanted to invest in the senior citizen scheme and contacted Tollygunge PO. However, I was informed that this scheme is applicable to people who can invest only within a month of opting for the VRS. Please suggest the course of action.

 Basudeb Mitra, by e-mail

 According to the revised notification issued to the postal authorities, persons of 55 years and above who had opted for VRS prior to the issue of notification could invest in the senior citizen scheme within one month of issuance of the notification. Since the notice was issued in November, the investment should have been done within the month of December. However, people opting for VRS now will have to invest the sum within one month of receiving the retirement benefits. According to the postal authorities, you will now be eligible to invest in the scheme only when you are 60.

 Swap benefit

 I had taken a home loan from GIC Housing Finance and had been claiming tax deduction under Section 88. However, recently I took a much larger loan from IDBI Bank to buy another flat. Is it possible to forego the tax benefit for the previous loan and claim for the loan taken from IDBI?

 R. Barua, by e-mail

 You can claim tax benefit for both your loans up to Rs 20,000 under section 88. You will be liable to pay tax on any amount exceeding the limit.

 Sharing the spoils

 My elder brother purchased a flat with a loan of Rs 10 lakh, the co-owner being my sister-in-law. Shall both of them be entitled to tax benefit under section 24 and 88 proportionately as both are salaried individuals?

 J. S. Paul, by e-mail

 If both of them are co-owners of the house as well as co-borrowers for the loan, they are individually and separately allowed to claim deduction up to the specified limit of Rs 1,50,000 for the interest payment under section 24 and Rs 20,000 for the principal amount.

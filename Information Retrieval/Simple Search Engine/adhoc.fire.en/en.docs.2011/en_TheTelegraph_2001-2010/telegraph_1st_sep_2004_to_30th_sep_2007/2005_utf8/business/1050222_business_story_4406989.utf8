 Calcutta, Feb. 21: Hitachi Home amp; Life Solutions (India) Limited plans to expand the domestic operations to capture a 15 per cent share of the air conditioner market. The company currently has a 10 per cent share of the organised market.

 Rakesh Khanna, senior vice-president, sales, marketing, service, said, ?The air conditioner market at 1 million units last year is estimated to be around Rs 2000 crore and is growing at an average of 18 per cent. With just one AC being sold for every four refrigerators in India against two AC?s for every one refrigerator worldwide, the Indian market offers huge potential.?

 Hitachi sold 95,000 units in the domestic market last year against 20,000 units it exported. ?We don?t see a huge growth in exports,? said Khanna. ?Our focus will be on growing the domestic market mainly through awareness drives.?

 The company?s window AC segment grew by 7-8 per cent against the industry 5 per cent, split AC?s by 35 per cent against market growth of 22 per cent.

 Hitachi AC?s are, however, 30-50 per cent costlier than other brands.

 The company plans to set up 300 ?Hitachi Profile Communicators? across the country where trained personnel will educate a prospective buyer on the type, tonnage and use of ACs.

 ?These will not be direct sales points but more of education outlets,? said Khanna. ?We will also focus on the 1000 direct billing dealers and 1500 outlets where our products are sold by enhancing their technology capability, customer orientation, speed of response and ability of service.?

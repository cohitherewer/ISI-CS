 Drug kingpins ?lead? from the front

 Mumbai, Nov. 16: Global pharmaceutical companies are turning over their research leads into drug molecules to a bunch of boffins in India as the cost of developing new drugs spirals to forbidding levels.

 Several well-known pharmaceutical companies, including GlaxoSmithKline, AstraZeneca and Altana of Germany, are asking Indian firms to pursue a few potentially profitable research leads.

 It?s called ?lead optimisation? in industry parlance, and observers expect the trend to continue as Indian companies have proved their mettle on the research front. Moreover, the country is emerging as an attractive contract manufacturing or sourcing destination.

 The first seeds were sown a couple of years back, when Ranbaxy and GlaxoSmithKline entered into a drug discovery and clinical development collaboration covering a wide range of therapeutic areas. Industry watchers say since then other players have signed agreements with Indian companies. 

 Experts like D.G. Shah, secretary general of Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance, reckons that many more global players will look at similar arrangements as research in India offers them a huge cost advantage. It is learnt that one of the companies that is looking at such a route is Novartis. 

 Essentially, lead optimisation is seen at the discovery stage. While innovators of drugs get numerous leads, they do not want to work on all of them. A cost-effective way is therefore to out-source the selection of a development-worthy drug candidate to a company overseas.

 ?While we are strong in the area of chemistry, there are many steps in lead optimisation that are repeated. Therefore, once we have a trained set of chemists who can work on such projects, its a win-win situation,? sources said. 

 They added that while the overseas company can reap cost benefits, such an arrangement adds to the topline of the collaborator in India even as the latter can leverage its discovery and early product development strengths. Moreover, in the event of a candidate being selected, the domestic company can reap a huge gain by obtaining marketing rights in India.

 For instance, in the Ranbaxy-Glaxo tie-up, it was decided that once a compound has been selected as a development candidate, in most instances GSK will take it to fruition. While GSK will have the exclusive commercialisation responsibilities worldwide, Ranbaxy would take the lead in India. The Delhi-based company also co-promotes in the US and EU, with permission from GSK.

 Industry circles feel that Indias position as a preferred lead optimisation destination will be strengthened as the country is also a good base to undertake clinical trials, a major step after a drug candidate is selected. They add that while it has a large number of English-speaking doctors, well-established medical institutions and a multi-racial population are the other advantages that the country can take advantage of in this regard.

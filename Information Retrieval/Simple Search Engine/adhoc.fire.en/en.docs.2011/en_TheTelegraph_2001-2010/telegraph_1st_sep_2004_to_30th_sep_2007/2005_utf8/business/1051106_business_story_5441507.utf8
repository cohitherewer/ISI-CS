 Study adds glitter to gold

 London, Nov. 5 (Reuters): Gold can be an excellent choice for investors seeking to hedge against inflation and is good at anticipating price rises, a study prepared for the industry-funded World Gold Council said.

 Official data provide little help to investors who must plan for the future because they only tell what is over and done with, according to the study by US-based research company H.C. Wainwright amp; Co. Economics Inc.

 The markets are really the best place to get a fast answer and commodities, in general, are very good places to figure out whether the currency is changing, David Ranson, director of Research at the company told Reuters.

 The report said gold is a more effective measure to predict inflation and could signal portfolio managers to look for other investment instruments to protect their investments.

 It works much better at anticipating monetary policy, quot; the report said.

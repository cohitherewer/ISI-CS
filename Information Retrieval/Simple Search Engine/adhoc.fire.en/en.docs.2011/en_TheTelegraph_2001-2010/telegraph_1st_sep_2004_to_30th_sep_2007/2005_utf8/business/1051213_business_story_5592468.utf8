 Whats on the menu

 Ministers from the World Trade Organisations (WTO) 149 member states are meeting in Hong Kong from December 13-18 to free global trade. Here are some of the issues that will be on the table as ministers try to clear the way towards a draft deal by early next year.

 Farm goods

 * The aim is to slash rich nations farm subsidies, which distort markets, and lower barriers to imports in developed and developing countries.

 * Subsidies: Much of the framework for a deal is in place ?the European Union has offered a cut of 70 per cent and the US 60 per cent. But the devil lies in the detail.

 * Tariffs: Most politically sensitive area. Big importers with heavily protected farming, like the EU, and on the developing side, Indonesia and India, do not want to open the door too wide.

 * The EU has offered cuts of 40 per cent, but with 8 per cent of its tariffs to be classified as sensitive and subject to shallower cuts.

 * The EU has agreed in principle to end export subsidies, but no date will emerge in Hong Kong as WTO states have given themselves until the end of February.

 Industrial goods

 * Known as NAMA in WTO parlance, they account for 60 per cent of the world trade. Negotiators are battling to agree on a formula, or formulas, for developed and developing nations. They are near agreement that whatever is adopted should cut the highest tariffs the most. Other key questions include the degree of flexibility to be given to developing countries.

 Services

 * Account for some 70 per cent of global economic activity, but less than a third of world trade. 

 * Critics say liberalisation will play into the hands of giant corporations because 80 per cent of services trade is carried out by transnationals.

 * Unlike in industrial and farm goods, where the aim is to reach a single agreement covering all WTO countries, services negotiations are handled through a process of request and offer between individual members.

 * Like agriculture, there are politically sensitive areas in services. One is making it easier for foreigners with special skills ? who could range from computer experts to hairdressers ? to get jobs in other WTO states. This is a key demand of developing countries like India.

 Development

 * The EU is among those pressing for a special package to help least developed countries to show the trade round will also benefit them.

 * Among suggestions is an accord to give duty-free access to all goods from least developed countries

 * Cotton could prove to be a contentious issue. African producers say US subsidies will drive them out of business and want a quick accord to end them.

 Rich nations in action to save trade talks

 London, Dec. 3 (Reuters): Britain sought to break a deadlock over trade liberalisation when the finance ministers of G-7 countries met on Saturday to debate economic strategy and to say goodbye to Alan Greenspan after 18 years as the US central bank chief. 

 London and Washington both hoped the meeting of ministers of the G-7 industrial powers ? the United States, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Canada and Britain ? would breathe life back into the troubled talks on trade liberalisation before a Hong Kong meeting of 148 countries in less than two weeks time. 

 In a move that troubled the French in particular, Gordon Brown, chairing the London meeting, called for an end to subsidies for farmers in rich countries ? aid and tariffs that are worth about $280 billion (?161 billion) a year according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 

 Agriculture is not the only dossier, French finance minister Thierry Breton said, reiterating Pariss line that the trade talks also covered services, industry, and intellectual property. 

 Growth trail

 The ministers and central bankers discussed the outlook for the world economy and the high cost of oil on Friday. 

 Everyone stated the global situation was encouraging in 2005 and 2006 despite oil prices which have weighed on growth in 2005, Thierry Breton told reporters. 

 European Central Bank chief Jean-Claude Trichet spoke to the ministers about his decision to raise interest rates in the Euro zone on Thursday to head inflation risks, a rise of a quarter of a percentage point to 2.25 percent in the key rate. 

 Exchange rates were not discussed in Fridays session of the G-7, but a Japanese official said there was no significant change to be expected in any case in the language the G-7 uses in its communiqu? on currencies. 

 Japanese finance minister Sadakazu Tanigaki said economic fundamentals explained the slide in the yen, which fell to more than 121 per dollar on Friday, its lowest in 32 months. 

 Turning to the affairs of the less well-off, ministers met Palestinian finance minister Salam Fayyad, who said the Palestinian Authority needs $200 million just to meet basic needs from now till February. 

 Trade blues 

 Browns main aim on Saturday was to get a renewed commitment to free trade ahead of the Hong Kong meeting of WTO member countries, which many believe could fail because of sparring over farm subsidies in rich nations. Africa, Brazil, India and other developing regions say these subsidies shut them out of world markets. 

 The United States signalled it was ready to deal as long as others were. We have to focus on a spirit of reciprocity, US treasury secretary John Snow said after meeting Brown on Friday. 

 G-7 officials said breaking the deadlock still seemed unlikely and, indeed, the G-7 forum is not one where people get into much more than declarations of commitment to free trade, rather than hard negotiating. 

 Trade ministers from some of the key economic regions were meeting separately in Geneva. 

 France, in particular, is unhappy about concessions being made on the European Unions behalf in the run-up to Hong Kong meeting. 

 Britain went as far as suggesting on Friday that it would be willing to convene an extraordinary meeting of leaders on the issue of free trade. The US President George W. Bushs office also said such an idea could be given thought if proposed.

 Calcutta, Oct. 14: The Essar group is considering a $1.2-billion investment in Trinidad and Tobago to set up an integrated steel plant.

 The Ruia-controlled Essar Global has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the government there for the 1.2-million-tonne unit.

 It will use natural gas as feedstock for the plant, while the iron ore is likely to be imported from Brazil. 

 Essar Global, which had signed a similar MoU with the Qatar government, would mainly target the nearby US market for its products.

 Essar is the second company after Ispat to set up a steel plant in our country, Pundit Maniedeo Persad, high commissioner of the Republic of Trindad and Tobago in India, said in Calcutta today.

 The company is currently carrying out a detailed plan of the project.

 Apart from Qatar and Trinidad and Tobago, the Essar group has sent proposals to states like Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Jharkhand to set up steel plants.

 The Trinidad plan envisages an initial investment of around $450 million for a pellet plant and a hot briquetted iron (HBI) facility. 

 HBI is a high-quality scrap substitute that can be used as an iron source in steel-making operations, while pellet is the basic raw material used to manufacture HBI. 

 An Essar official said the company was exploring growth opportunities at home and abroad and the Trinidad project was one of the options being considered.

 The company will initially start with the pellet and HBI plants and would further move on to manufacture slabs and hot-rolled coils.

 Taj venture

 A number of Indian companies are interested in investing in the West Indian island, the ambassador told the members of the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

 The Taj group was also in talks for a presence in the country, he added.

 It is interested in management contract of properties. An Indian bank is also serious about opening a branch there, Persad said without divulging details.

 The high commissioner also said his country was keen on attracting tourists from India. 

 We will develop products to attract tourists travelling to Europe to visit our country, he said.

 Among the Indian corporate houses, Asian Paints and New India Assurance are already present there.

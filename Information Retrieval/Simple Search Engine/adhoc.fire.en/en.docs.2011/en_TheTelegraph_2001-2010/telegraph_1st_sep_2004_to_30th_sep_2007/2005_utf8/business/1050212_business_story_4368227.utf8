 Iran to manage gas pipeline via Pakistan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 11: Iran is ready to construct the 2,775-km natural gas pipeline to India via Pakistan by the end of 2009 if an agreement is reached on the issue. This will enable the gas to flow into India some time in 2010-2011.

 The issue of mutual sovereign guarantees for ensuring supplies is also reported to have figured in the discussions on the pipeline held here today between petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar and Iranian ambassador Siyavash Zaragar Yaghoubi. 

 ?I am going to Tehran in June and hope this will act as a catalyst in furthering a pact on import of natural gas through a pipeline passing via Pakistan,? Aiyar said.

 Petroleum secretary S. C. Tripathi said, ?We will also seek comfort from Iran in the form of commitment to supply liquefied natural gas in case supplies are disrupted.? 

 He said strategic storage facilities would be built in Rajasthan or Gujarat as an insurance against disruption in supplies of natural gas through the Pakistani territory.

 ?There will be two sets of bilateral agreements. In the first one, Iran will enter into a pact with India for delivery of natural gas at the Indian border. The second pact will be between Iran and Pakistan and govern how the gas is to be transported to the Indian border,? Aiyar said. India does not want to be associated with the construction, maintenance or operation of the pipeline, which will pass through 760-km of the Pakistani territory. 

 New Delhi will not enter into any agreement with Pakistan and deal only with Iran on the issue. It will be Tehran?s responsibility to strike a deal with Pakistan for laying the pipeline and delivering the gas safely to the Indian border, the minister said. 

 The petroleum minister said though initial estimates suggest that 60 million standard cubic metres per day of natural gas would be available to India from Iran, this amount could be increased. 

 ?Pakistan has said it would require 50 million standard cubic metres of gas per day from the Iranian pipeline,? he added. Pakistan is also keen that India goes in for the project as it would be able to get its own gas at a cheap price and charge India a transit fee for the pipeline.

 However, the Indian government has been worried over the high-risk of disruption of supplies since the pipeline will be coming through a hostile country.

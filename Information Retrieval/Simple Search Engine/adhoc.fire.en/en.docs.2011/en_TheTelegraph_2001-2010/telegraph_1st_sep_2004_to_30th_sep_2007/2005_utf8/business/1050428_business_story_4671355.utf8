 Shoppers? Stop offer cleared

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 27: The Supreme Court today removed all the hurdles to the Rs 150-crore initial public offer (IPO) of Shoppers? Stop.

 A division bench presided by Justice N. Santosh Hegde stayed an interim order issued by the Shillong bench of Guwahati High Court that had restrained the company from going through with its public issue. 

 The matter came up during the ?urgent mention hour? of the court. 

 Justice Hegde said ?in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, the interests of justice will be met only by staying the impugned order of the high court.?

 The apex court also made it clear in the order that no other court or forum shall pass any interim order pertaining to the public issue till it decides on the matter.

 The Shoppers? Stop IPO opened for subscription today and will close on May 3. 

 On Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) directed the company to put the IPO on hold until further orders following the high court?s ruling on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the North Eastern Investors Association. 

 Appearing for the petitioner, senior counsel R. Nariman contended that it was a private interest litigation in the garb of a PIL filed by ?vested interests? who went to a remote corner of the country to get a restraining order from a high court. The objective was to ensure that the company would not be able to appear before the court to present its views. As a result, the IPO could be delayed.

 The bench observed that the ?restraining? order of the high court was stayed until further orders of the Supreme Court.

 Shoppers? Stop can now go ahead with the IPO to to fund its expansion which is estimated to cost about Rs 130 crore.

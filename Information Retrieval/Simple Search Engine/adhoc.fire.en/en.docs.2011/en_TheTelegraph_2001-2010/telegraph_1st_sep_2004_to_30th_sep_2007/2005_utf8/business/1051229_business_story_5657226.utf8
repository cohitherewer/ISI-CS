 Indian Oil to shed part of ONGC stake

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 28: The board of state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) today approved the sale of one-fifth of its stake in Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and half of its holding in GAIL.

 IOC has a 9.6 per cent stake in ONGC and holds 4.8 per cent in GAIL.

 The stake sale comes after a Union cabinet meeting on November 24 cleared a proposal moved by the petroleum ministry to allow the state-owned oil companies to disentangle the crossholdings that were created seven years ago. In 1999, in order to reduce its runaway fiscal deficit, the government had raised Rs 4,643 crore by directing the state-owned oil companies to pick up stakes in each other.

 The IOC board said the proposed sale would be subject to necessary approvals from the appropriate government authorities, including the ministries of petroleum and finance.

 The oil companies want to sell the shares to pay debt and fund their expansion plans.

 On December 23, the ONGC board cleared a proposal to offload its stake in IOC and GAIL either fully or in tranches. ONGC holds 9.11 per cent in IOC and 4.8 per cent in GAIL which it purchased in 1999 for Rs 1,617 crore. At current market prices, the holding is worth over Rs 6,700 crore. The disentangling of the crossholdings will generate over Rs 20,000 crore for the three state-owned companies at current prices. The stake sale will be made through the secondary markets as they want to realise the best prices that the market can offer. The oil companies have decided against selling the stakes to each other because of this reason.

 Prudence demands that the oil companies sell their stakes in tranches so as not to precipitate a slump in the stock prices. 

 Meanwhile, the IOC board also revised its proposal of a share swap ratio to 110:100 for the merger of IBP Company Ltd with it. Shareholders of IBP will get 110 shares of IOC with a face value of Rs 10 each for every 100 shares that they hold in IBP.

 The decision means that IBP shareholders will get fewer shares in IOC than was proposed earlier. Under the earlier plan, IBP shareholders were supposed to get 125 shares in IOC for every 100 shares they held.

 Although the government had approved the scheme of amalgamation, it had advised IOC to re-consider the swap ratio under a different valuation.

 The company is required to get prior approval of the government before initiating any move for merger or acquisition, it said.

 Merck boss quits, insider at the helm 

 Gilmartin: Calls it a day

 New York, May 5 (Reuters): Merck amp; Co Inc on Thursday named a company insider to replace embattled chief executive Raymond Gilmartin, a move that was greeted with little enthusiasm by investors who hoped for a high-profile outsider to turn the drugmaker around.

 Gilmartin, who resigned, will be replaced immediately by Richard Clark, who is currently president of Mercks manufacturing division. He was previously CEO of Medco Health Solutions Inc, the pharmacy benefit management company that was recently spun off by Merck.

 Mercks shares rose 6 cents to $34.99 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

 Gilmartin resigned ahead of his scheduled retirement in 2006, following the withdrawal of the companys arthritis drug Vioxx last September and Mercks failure to produce enough new drugs to offset the ones that are losing patent protection.

 ?I think highly of Clark, but hes basically a consolation prize because Wall Street wanted new blood, and hes a Merck insider,? said Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan.

 Merck said it will have no chairman for up to two years. Instead, it formed an executive committee led by Lawrence Bossidy, former chairman and CEO of Honeywell International Inc, to fill that role.

 ?You have to think they couldnt get a superstar CEO from outside the company. Nobody would take the job,? said Oppenheimer amp; Co analyst Scott Henry. ?The fact that hes from (Medco) tells you hes focused on insurance payers instead of on innovation.?

 Pharmacy benefit managers, like Medco, are paid by insurers to watch that drugstores only dispense medicines on the insurance plans list of pre-authorised drugs ? a middleman role to keep drug costs down.

 Clark said on a conference call he will not ignore innovation, but did not immediately announce any major changes in strategy at Merck. 

 ?We will be focused on internal growth as well as external growth through licensing? of products from other companies, Clark said. ?You have to remember I was born and raised at Merck, and understand that scientific excellence is the future of the company.?

 Clark has led Mercks manufacturing operations in multiple countries and was responsible for Mercks global information services infrastructure. He became Medco president in 2000 and was named chairman and CEO in 2002. Medco was spun off from Merck in March 2003.

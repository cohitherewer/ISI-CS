 GE ready to help switch on Dabhol

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 30: General Electric (GE) today indicated it will work with NTPC and Bhel to find ways to restart and complete the stalled Dabhol power project. 

 The US conglomerate will send its engineers and technical advisers to examine the turbines and other equipment it had supplied to Dabhol, a statement issued by Scott Bayman, president and CEO of GE India, said today.

 The evaluations and the findings of NTPC and Bhel on the unfinished work at the plant site will help the partners draw up a schedule for restarting the first phase, and completing the second stage of the power venture.

 GE is pleased with the course of discussions it held with various stakeholders of Dabhol Power and looks forward to a complete resolution of the pending issues, Bayman said.

 We have always held that a fully operational plant is in the best interests of the people. We are keen to put the past of Dabhol behind us, help bring power to the people of Maharashtra and pursue growth initiatives across a wide range of businesses in the country, he added.

 The decision to join hands with NTPC and Bhel follows the visit of GE chairman and CEO Jeffrey Immelt last week, when he met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and ministers of power, finance and industry. Immelt said at a CII conclave in Delhi, and later in Mumbai, that GEs interest lay in resolving the Dabhol tangle.

 We are keen to put people on the ground very quickly. For us, it is not about money at all but about the future role in the project. The intention is to help re-start the plant, and we can play a major role in it, he had said.

 GE Energy is among the worlds leading supplier of power generation and delivery equipment, with revenues of $17.3 billion in 2004. The change in its Dabhol stand comes at a time when Maharashtra is facing an acute power crisis. Those problems appeared to be getting worse today when the state government said a unit of the Koyna hydro-electric plant would have to be closed because water levels in the dam were too low to produce energy.

 The Dabhol project was the first fast-track private project that was launched with a great deal of fanfare in the first flush of reforms in India. It was ridden by controversy because of counter-guarantees that the now beleaguered Enron Corporation was able to extract from the Centre. The project faltered after Enron collapsed amid a massive accounting scandal in the US.

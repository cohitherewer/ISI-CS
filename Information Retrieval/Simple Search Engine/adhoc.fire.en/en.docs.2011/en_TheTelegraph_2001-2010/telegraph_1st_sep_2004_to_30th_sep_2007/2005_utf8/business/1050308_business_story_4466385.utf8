 Call for close vigil on global crude rates

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 7: Economics affairs secretary Rakesh Mohan today said while a close watch should be kept on international oil prices, the rate of inflation should be reined below 5 per cent.

 ?Oil prices have risen above $50 per barrel again. So we need to keep a constant watch on inflation,? Mohan said at a seminar organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 The economic affairs secretary also said the financial system has a surplus liquidity of about Rs 1,00,000 crore in the system because of huge foreign exchange flows and the proposed special purpose vehicle (SPV) for infrastructure development could raise resources from the domestic market.

 The SPV, proposed in the Union budget for financing large road, port and airport projects, could raise funds at competitive rates with 100 per cent government guarantee, and in turn lend them to projects for a long-term basis, he added.

 Regarding the country?s foreign exchange reserves, which have been boosted by higher FII inflows, Mohan said such huge forex flows caused ?macro management? problems. 

 The RBI issues market stabilisation securities (MSS) to absorb the abundant rupee resources generated as a result of its intervention in the forex markets.

 Mohan said MSS issuances in the coming fiscal would depend on the extent of forex inflows. 

 The government has projected MSS issuances for 2005-06 at Rs 150,000 crore. The state government borrowings will be lower in 2005-06 than in the current fiscal, he added.

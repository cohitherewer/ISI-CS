 Calcutta, Jan. 12: Tata Steel today signed a shareholders? agreement with West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) to form a joint venture company that will set up a 0.8 million-tonne merchant coke oven plant and a 60-MW power unit at Haldia.

 The joint venture company ? Hooghly Met Coke amp; Power Co Ltd ? will invest Rs 700 crore in the first phase. The company plans to invest Rs 1,500 crore in two phases, which will be the second largest investment after Haldia Petrochemicals in Bengal in recent years.

 The project will help the Tatas to have a captive source of metallurgical coke ? an important raw material for steel. Most of the domestic steel companies have to import metcoke from Australia at a high price.

 The shareholders? agreement was signed by Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman and his WBIDC counterpart Gopal Krishna in presence of Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, state commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen and Tata Sons chairman Ratan Tata.

 The Rs 700-crore project will have a 1:1 debt equity ratio. WBIDC will take a 2 per cent exposure in the company. The Tatas will invest in Hooghly Met Coke through Tata Steel and other group companies.

 The metcoke project will come up on the 180-acre unused plot of the erstwhile Haldia Fertiliser, which is owned by the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT). 

 WBIDC and the Tatas had jointly submitted bids for the land and the CPT has recently approved them. A final approval from the Union ministry of shipping is expected within a month, Gopal Krishna said.

 Hooghly Met Coke will also generate 60 MW of power by utilising hot flue gas from coke ovens. The power generated will be sold to the West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) at Rs 1.86 per unit. A power purchase agreement was also signed today with the WBSEB.

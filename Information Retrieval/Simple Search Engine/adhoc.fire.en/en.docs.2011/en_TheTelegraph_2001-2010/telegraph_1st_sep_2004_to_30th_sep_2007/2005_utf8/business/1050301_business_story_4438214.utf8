 High-income class enters sop opera

 GARIMA SINGH

New Delhi, Feb. 28: The glass ceiling has been pierced: taxpayers with incomes above Rs 5 lakh will now be able to claim deductions on investments on a range of instruments that they were barred from earlier.

 That is one of the biggest benefits that flows from finance minister P. Chidambarams decision to allow every taxpayer a consolidated limit of Rs 1 lakh for savings which will be deducted from the income before tax is calculated.

 While lifting the barrier, the finance minister has triggered a set of major tax reforms that take a few concepts and ideas of the past out of our lexicon forever. Standard deduction ? the buzzword in the taxpayers dictionary ? has finally fallen by the wayside.

Chidambaram has eliminated the rebate under section 

88 and jettisoned section 80 L.

 In comes a new section 80C under which all taxpayers will be allowed a deduction of Rs 1 lakh on the investments they make by way of life insurance premia payments, contributions to provident fund or schemes for deferred annuities, purchase of infrastructure bonds, payment of tuition fees and repayment of the principal on housing loans. 

The amendments will come into effect from April 1, 

2006 and you will be able to claim these deductions in the assessment 2006-07.

 But get ready for the biggest change that has yet to place: Chidambaram said the government intended to move towards an exempt-exempt -tax (EET) regime in line with international practices. What this means is that there will be no tax in the year that the taxpayer invests in a savings instrument nor in the years when the gains accrue by way of bonuses and interest. But when he withdraws the amount on maturity, he will be taxed on the sum withdrawn. 

 Chidambaram said the government intended to set up a committee of experts to draw up a roadmap to move towards the EET system.

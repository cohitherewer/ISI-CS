 New Delhi, Nov. 29: The Union communications ministry is planning to auction the spectrum for third generation (3G) services and hopes to collect more than Rs 10,000 crore. 

 The proposal is likely to upset cellular mobile operators like AirTel and Hutch, as they will have to bid for the additional spectrum to offer 3G services. For several months, they have been demanding the allocation of additional spectrum free of cost.

 Spectrum or airwaves is a key resource for providing mobile services, while 3G is a generic term used for next generation mobile communication systems.

 The new service will offer a download speed of 384 kilo bits per second on mobile phones, which will allow the user to watch video, movie clips, a live cricket match and even trade on the stock market using real-time price information. A three-hour movie can be downloaded in 20-30 minutes on these mobile phones.

 At present, mobile operators in India offer a maximum speed of 177 kbps using the enhanced data rate for global evolution (EDGE) technology.

 Communications minister Dayanidhi Maran today hinted at the governments plans to auction spectrum for 3G services. He said existing operators would have to apply for a 3G licence. 

 Addressing the India Economic Summit, Maran said, When we open up 3G spectrum, we need new companies. The spectrum is special and when new companies will come in, they will bring fresh investments. They will also offer customers new value-added services at more competitive prices and ensure that there is no compromise on voice. 

 When asked whether the spectrum will be auctioned, Maran said the government was closely examining the methods used to allocate spectrum worldwide. The method best suited for the Indian condition will be adopted.

 This is the best opportunity to bring in more players. It will be our priority to bring in more players, since it will lead to increased competition and a drop in prices. We hope to allocate the 3G spectrum next year, Maran said.

 He also said operators with 3G spectrum would be able to offer high-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA) on their networks. HSDPA-enabled mobile handsets can offer data speeds up to 3 mega bits per second.

 Sources in the ministry said the finance ministry had also indicated that spectrum was a scarce resource and had to be procured at a cost from those holding it.

 Focus on IT

 Maran has urged government departments to increase the use of information technology by spending 3 per cent of their budgetary allocations on IT.

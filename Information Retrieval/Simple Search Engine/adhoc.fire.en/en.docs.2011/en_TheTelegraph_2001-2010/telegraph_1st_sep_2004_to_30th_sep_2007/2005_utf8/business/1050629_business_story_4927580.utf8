 Calcutta, June 28: Srei Infrastructure Finance Limited has reported a 38 per cent increase in net profit to Rs 28.3 crore for 2004-05 helped by a 45 per cent increase in disbursements at Rs 1,600 crore. In the previous fiscal, the company had earned Rs 20.44 crore profit on a disbursement of Rs 1,100 crore.

 Sreis gross profit recorded a growth of 37 per cent to Rs 40.98 crore against Rs 29.82 crore in 2003-04.

 The total assets under management of the company expanded to Rs 2,240 crore, while its net worth increased to Rs 172 crore from Rs 154 crore. Encouraged by improved results in 2004-05, the company has declared a 15 per cent dividend to shareholders.

 We hope to maintain a similar growth rate in the current fiscal and cross the Rs 2,000-crore mark in loan disbursement, said Hemant Kanoria, vice-chairman and managing director, Srei Infrastructure Finance Limited.

 The company plans to go in for an external commercial borrowing of around $60 million and has approached the Reserve Bank of India for the necessary approvals. We expect to receive the approvals shortly, added Kanoria.

 He said the company has set aside around Rs 300 crore to finance solar projects in home lighting systems in the Sunderbans and other areas.

 We have already applied for the necessary approvals and expect it within the next couple of months. The projects will be completed within one year, said Kanoria.

 Meanwhile, Srei Capital Markets Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Srei Infrastructure, has entered into a joint venture with West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) for setting up infrastructure facilities.

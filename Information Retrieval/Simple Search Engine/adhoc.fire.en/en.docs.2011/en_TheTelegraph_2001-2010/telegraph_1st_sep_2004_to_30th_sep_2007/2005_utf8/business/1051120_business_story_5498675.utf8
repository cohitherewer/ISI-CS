 Key meet to curb crude volatility

 Price point

 Riyadh, Nov. 19 (Reuters): Global oil consumers and producers met in Saudi Arabia on Saturday to discuss calls for greater transparency in oil markets and investment in production capacity to curb volatile crude prices.

 Ministers and officials from the energy-hungry United States, China, India and the European Union held talks behind closed doors with oil giant Saudi Arabia and other major Opec exporters.

 The talks come ahead of the formal release later on Saturday of an oil market database compiled by the Riyadh-based International Energy Forum, which aims to foster dialogue and exchange of information between producers and consumers.

 With increased knowledge about both what the consuming nations are consuming...and what the supplying nations are supplying and what their commitment is, there will be increased stability in markets, US energy secretary Sam Bodman said.

 US oil prices hit a record $70 a barrel in late August, before easing to $56 on Friday.

 A study released by the US Congresss joint economic committee said this week that OPEC producers ? of which Saudi Arabia is the biggest ? have kept their production levels down and pushed up crude prices.

 Britains finance minister Gordon Brown was scheduled to join his French counter-part Thierry Breton at the talks. Both have pressed Opec to pump as much as possible and also improve visibility and predictability on oil markets.

 But producers blame a lack of global refining capacity for the spike. They have offered an extra 2 million barrels per day (bpd) and say they have had no takers.

 Saudi Arabias oil ministry said this week that the role of speculators driving up prices will also be on the agenda in Riyadh.

 Andhra prefers VW project to cheque

 Hyderabad, Sept. 6: The Andhra Pradesh government today refused Volkswagens offer to return Rs 11 crore, which was allegedly swindled by its India representative Helmuth Schuster. The state is more keen to see the project take off.

 In view of the ongoing CBI inquiry into the issue, we have declined to accept the money. We are more interested in seeing that Volkswagen sets up its car plant here, chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy told reporters after meeting the Volkswagen special envoy Frank Elbe here.

 The state plans to send an official delegation to Wolfsberg, the Volkswagen headquarters, on September 28, to speed up the car project. 

 In an apparent damage-control exercise by the European car giant, Elbe called on the chief minister and sought to hand over the cheque for Rs 11 crore, owning moral responsibility for the alleged fraud committed by Schuster. The sacked executive is now facing investigation in Germany.

 I have been maintaining that the money paid by the state government (to Vashisht Wahan towards its equity contribution) will be safe and secured. We only need to identify the persons responsible for the goof-up, Reddy said.

 In the interest of transparency and in view of the ongoing investigation by CBI, we are not accepting the money that Volkswagen wants to return to us, Reddy said.

 He was confident that the project would become a reality despite obstacles.

 Asked whether his government was proposing alternative sites for the car factory, the chief minister said, We are ready to consider any other proposals for change of site and terms. 

 Elbe, however, thanked Reddy for his gesture of not accepting the compensation from Volkswagen. 

 About the project, he said the stage is set for official discussions and asked the chief minister send to a delegation to Germany soon to work out details. 

 The state industry minister, J. Geeta Reddy, said it would be unethical on the part of the state government to accept the amount from Volkswagen now. The CBI has already traced a major portion of the amount within the country, she said. 

 The scandal pertains to the hurried payment of Rs 11 crore made by the state government to the Delhi-based Vashisht Wahan, which was supposed to be the Indian arm of Volkswagen and a special purpose vehicle executing the planned car plant at Visakhapatnam.

 The money was, however, spirited away by Schuster, causing major embarrassment to the Congress government. It has ordered a CBI probe into the scam and shifted minister B. Satyanarayana from the key industries portfolio.

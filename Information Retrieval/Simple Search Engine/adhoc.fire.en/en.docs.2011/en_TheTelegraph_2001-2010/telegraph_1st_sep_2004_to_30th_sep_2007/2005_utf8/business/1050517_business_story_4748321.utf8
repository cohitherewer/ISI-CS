 System in place for better gas distribution

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 16: State-owned gas utility Gail (India) Ltd has implemented an innovative gas management system (GMS) to simplify gas transportation and distribution.

 The web-enabled system ensures better co-ordination and total transparency and is a step towards advanced customer service, Gail said.

 The system facilitates smooth handling of different streams of natural gas from multiple supply sources pumped into the pipeline systems for delivery to multiple end users.

 GMS has been implemented on the Hazira-Bijapur-Jagdishpur pipeline, Dahej-Vijaipur pipeline, south Gujarat, north Gujarat, Mumbai, KG basin, Cauvery basin, Agartala, Lakwa and Rajasthan pipeline networks.

 Gail transmits 80 million standard cubic metres per day of gas through a 5400-km pipeline network.

 GMS creates a common platform by integrating multiple players ? the suppliers (ONGC, Petronet LNG, Panna/Mukta Tapti joint venture, Cairn Energy and Oil India), Shippers (IOC and BPCL), customers (power, fertiliser plants and other industries) and transporter (Gail).

 The system facilitates in contract management, long term gas scheduling, nominations between buyers and sellers, gas allocation and delivery to customers from multiple shippers.

 Facilitating gas reconciliation in interconnected and independent pipeline networks, the system has interface with supervisory control and data acquisition (Scada) systems to get daily gas sale and gas purchase data, the release said. 

 GMS can also generate fortnightly gas invoices to APM and R-LNG customers and transportation invoices to the shippers. 

 Taking advantage of the system, Gail has doubled the supply of regassified LNG (RLNG) through the DVPL system since April 2005 to 17.5 million cubic metres per day.

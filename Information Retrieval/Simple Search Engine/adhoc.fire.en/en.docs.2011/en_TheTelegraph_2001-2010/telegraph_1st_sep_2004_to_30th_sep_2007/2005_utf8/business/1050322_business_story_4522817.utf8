 Regulator set to get sweeping powers

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, March 21: True to his style, finance minister P. Chidambaram has served an ace in Parliament today in the form of the new pension regulatory bill. 

 The bill could perhaps take away from law-makers the right to thrash out controversial issues such as foreign investment levels in new pension funds, where the money collected by the new pension funds will be invested ? within the country or abroad, how much of it can be shovelled into the stock market and how much in gilts. 

 Legislators have not been able to identify the loopholes as yet.

 There is no section that clearly defines ownership of pension funds. Unlike the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority Act, which caps foreign investment, either directly or indirectly, in an Indian insurance firm at 26 per cent, the bill remains silent on the issue, leaving enough delegated powers to the pension regulator and the government to determine this through notification.

 North Block has long advocated 100 per cent foreign direct investment in pension funds and at least 49 per cent FDI in insurance. It was prevented from raising the FDI limit in insurance after the Left and the BJP threatened to defeat amendments to the IRDA Act on this. 

 However, the government now seems to have decided to simply take this particular issue out of Parliaments ambit by giving away the powers to decide to the executive. 

 In a similar fashion, section 14 of the bill clearly states that the new regulator will lay down ?norms for the management of the corpus of the pension funds, including investment guidelines?. 

 This in effect means that unlike the Insurance Regulatory Development Act, this bill does not specify whether and how much of the corpus needs to be invested within the country. 

 It also does not specify norms for investment in the stock or the gilts market. But then, normally, that is a function which the regulator performs everywhere. 

 The bill of course is designed not merely to help run just the new defined pension scheme of the government. Section 13 of the bill states that the pension fund regulator?s ambit will not be limited to just the new pension scheme of the government but will cover ?any other pension scheme not regulated by any other enactment.? 

 The only pension scheme which is regulated by acts of Parliament happen to be the Employees Provident Fund, Coal Mines Provident Fund, Seamens Provident Funds, Assam Tea Plantation Provident and Pension Scheme and Jammu and Kashmir Employees Provident Fund. 

 In effect, this means that the sector is being thrown open through the bill. That perhaps is the most welcome measure. The unwelcome part of course will be the intense political battle that will be waged before the bill is passed in any form.

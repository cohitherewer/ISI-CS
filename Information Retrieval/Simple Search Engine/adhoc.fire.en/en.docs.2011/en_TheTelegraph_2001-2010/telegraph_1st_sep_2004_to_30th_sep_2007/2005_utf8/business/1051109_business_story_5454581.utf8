 Stocks surge, rupee rallies

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 8: Markets scored a century for the second day in a row as the BSE sensex soared past the 8300-threshold on the back of a buying binge in the shares of bellwether pharmaceutical and technology companies.

 The 111-point surge that took the benchmark index to 8317.80 also fired up a wobbly rupee, which clawed back from an intra-day low of 46.08 to 45.778 against the dollar.

 The mood in the market was lifted by figures, which showed foreign institutional investors (FIIs) reversing their trading stance from that of a seller to a buyer. Fresh figures released by Sebi put their net purchases at over Rs 1000 crore in the futures segment and Rs 435 crore in the cash section in the first two days of this month. They had been dumping shares for much of last month.

 The sensex opened moderately higher at 8218.82 and rallied to 8353.10 before ending at 8317.80 against Mondays close of 8206.83, a rise of 110.97 points, or 1.35 per cent. It had vaulted by 134 points on Monday.

 Brokers said technology and pharmaceutical stocks were big draws. The rally in the first was fuelled by the prospect of higher earnings as a result of a strong dollar. Software firms make much of their money from overseas clients, who pay them for assignments in greenbacks. TCS, Infosys, Satyam Computers and Wipro sizzled.

 Drug companies jived on the trading floor as expectations grew that they would reap rich dividends from manufacturing generic drugs meant to treat bird flu.

 Other reasons for the strong showing in the market were the robust economic fundamentals and the recent slide in global oil prices, which dipped to $57.53 a barrel in London today.

 Auto stocks also had a good run as reports of galloping sales put shares of Bajaj Auto, Hero Honda, Maruti and Tata Motors in top gear.

 In the inter-bank forex market, where currencies are traded, the rupee rebound was triggered by data that confirmed FIIs were returning to the stock market. Banks were also seen selling the greenback. At the close of 45.78, the rupee had rallied 14 paise over its last close.

 The Reserve Bank intervened through dollar sales by state-run banks when the rupee was teetering at 45.99. This helped it claw back to 45.83 and then to 45.78. Prior to todays recovery, the rupee declined 82 paise since October 31 and over 3.50 per cent when measured against the level early last month. 

 Shyam Baxi of e-Mecklai said the rupee is likely to remain range bound for some time, though the dollar could swing in line with overseas trends. The rupee could again fall to 46 or even 46.25, he added.

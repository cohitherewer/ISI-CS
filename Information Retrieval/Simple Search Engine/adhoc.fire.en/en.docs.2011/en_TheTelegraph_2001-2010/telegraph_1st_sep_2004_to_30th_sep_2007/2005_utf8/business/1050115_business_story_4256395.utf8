 Tax relief for DTA units

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 14: The government today issued notifications allowing manufacturing and service units that were set up for the domestic market but later converted into export-oriented units to be eligible for tax exemptions till 2009-10.

 In a circular issued by the Central Board of Direct Taxes, the government clarified that ?undertakings in domestic tariff areas, which converted themselves into 100 per cent EOUs, will qualify for tax benefits as offered to other EOUs under section 10b of the Income Tax Act.?

 In order to avail of the tax sop, the unit has to show that it manufactures export items or produces computer software which is exported. ?The deduction would be available only from the year in which the unit gets approval as a 100 per cent EOU,? the statement said.

 The tax benefit would be available for the remaining period of 10 consecutive assessment years beginning from the period it started manufacturing in the domestic tariff area.

 ICICI Bank to prune Federal Bank stake

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 9: ICICI Bank will consider diluting its stake in Federal Bank after the latter launches its proposed GDR issue of Rs 450 crore.

 ICICI Bank holds a 20.76 per cent stake in Federal Bank. According to the Reserve Bank of India guideline, ICICI Bank has to bring down its stake in Federal Bank to 5 per cent. 

 Talking to newspersons on the sidelines of a seminar on banking organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry here today, ICICI Bank chairman K.V. Kamath said, ICICI Banks stake in Federal Bank will come down after the proposed GDR. However, we have not kept a timeframe for diluting our stake. It will be done as and when required.

 A few months ago Kamath had said within three months the bank would decide on diluting its stake in Federal Bank. Sources said ICICI Bank might wait for the GDR and then initiate the process of dilution.

 ICICI Bank is in talks with IFC, Washington, for selling its stake in Federal Bank. When asked, Kamath said, My department is looking into the matter. I cannot comment on it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

Foundation quite strong

Homing In / Nasser Munjee

This year?s budget has been crafted in a manner in 

which the ship of State is not only on high cruise mode but is actually heading 

in a direction of our choice.

The underlying message is clear: growth with employment; 

prosperity with distribution; emphasis on rural development and ?basic infrastructure 

for the poor?. 

The Bharat Nirman programme will focus on irrigation, 

roads, energy, water, housing and telecom. For the first time we see such a concerted 

attempt to address some of these problems.

The need for infrastructure investments is clearly 

felt. Raising resources for infrastructure investments need also to be addressed. 

Dedicating the cess on petrol and diesel specifically for roads is the first explicit 

use of dedicated funds for development.

I think this is an excellent beginning. We have driven 

this concept for years to no avail. We see it happening now.

The proposals for infrastructure is, at first hearing, 

a bit strange. Risks need to be allocated and spread among institutions and fund 

providers and each has a different attitude to risk and appetite. Pricing will 

differ as a result. If you take the life cycle financing of a project, different 

institutions will be interested in different slices of the risk. 

To my mind this concept smacks of half-baked ideas 

which were discussed over a year ago and now re-emerging simply because some hard 

thinking of what ails Indian Infrastructure has not been undertaken. If you do 

not know what to do in infrastructure (which is still the case with public policy) 

then we wave a wand and get an SPV. This will not help us to move further.

The fact that the urban agenda is back in reckoning 

is something to rejoice about. It?s not just rural India that needs help ? it 

is urban India that produces the bulk of the wealth produced by this country. 

The central government must take cities very seriously 

indeed and not just the metros as has been amply suggested in the budget speech. 

This is one element that has my whole hearted support.

What has been hinted at in the budget speech is the 

use of citizen, community groups and panchayati raj institutions ? in other words 

civil society institutions.

Partnership is in the air. There is an old quip that 

says?Governments are too small for the big things and too big for the small things?. 

Infrastructure is a very big thing and will require a partnership approach and 

not an ?administered? approach. 

What the government should have done is create an 

expert panel that would pilot vital and innovative infrastructure projects.

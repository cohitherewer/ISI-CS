 New Delhi, Oct. 21: Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd has suffered a loss of Rs 10.77 crore for the third quarter ended September 30 compared with a profit of Rs 141.3 crore in the same period last year. Total income also dipped to Rs 870.23 crore during the quarter against Rs 896.57 crore a year ago.

 Although profits dropped, the board today approved an interim dividend of 50 per cent at Rs 2.50 per share of par value Rs 5 for the year ending December 31.

 The record date for the purpose of interim dividend has been fixed on November 5.

 Lower drug prices in the US market, rising R amp;D expenditure and litigation bills have put the company in the red during the quarter.

 CEO Brian Tempest said, It has not been a good quarter for us. Weakness in the US market due to price deflation has not only affected our sales but also our net profit.

 The price deflation in the worlds largest pharmaceutical market is expected to continue through the year, he added.

 The companys R amp;D expenses have increased 79 per cent year-on-year. 

 Ranbaxy is also involved in a host of litigations across the world. We have a budget of about $30 million as litigation cost for the year, Tempest said.

 For Ranbaxy and its subsidiaries, the consolidated profit after tax (after minority interest) during the quarter was down 90.8 per cent at Rs 18.4 crore against Rs 200.1 crore in the same period last year.

 The companys consolidated sales stood at Rs 13,03.9 crore (Rs 1,343.9 crore).

 An extraordinary general meeting of the company has approved increase of its authorised share capital to Rs 300 crore from Rs 200 crore.

 The EGM has also approved borrowing in excess of paid-up capital and free reserves of the company up to Rs 5,000 crore, while also allowing increasing the limit of shareholding of FIIs up to 50 per cent of the share capital of the company.

 The board has also cleared plans to raise financial resources up to $1.5 billion in one or more tranches from time to time through FCCBs/ADRs/GDRs or other appropriate security instruments. 

 Tempest said Ranbaxy has lined up a few first-to-file products for launches next year

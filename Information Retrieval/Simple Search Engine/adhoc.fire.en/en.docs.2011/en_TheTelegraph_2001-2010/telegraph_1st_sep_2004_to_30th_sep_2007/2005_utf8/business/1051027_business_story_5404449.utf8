 HDFC, Ross link up for rejig funding

 Parekh: Building bridges

 Calcutta, Oct. 26: Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) has tied up with WL Ross and Company LLC (WL Ross) to invest in Indian corporate restructurings and turnarounds.

 WL Ross will launch an overseas fund to raise money from the US to invest in Indian companies facing special or distressed situations, sources said. The process will involve taking over such companies or their assets, turning them around and selling them off.

 WL Ross had raised $1.1 billion through four to five similar funds in other countries, including the US, Japan and Korea. ?The new fund will garner over $100 million, though the exact amount has not yet been decided,? a source said.

 The arrangement involves setting up an asset management company in which HDFC will hold a 19.9 per cent stake. ?Since setting up an asset management company does not require a huge capital outlay, the investment of HDFC will not be substantial,? said the source.

 However, HDFC will have a co-investment opportunity in the companies, which will not exceed 10 per cent of the fund size.

 WL Ross, a leading private equity investor in corporate revamps, has executed some major turnarounds in the steel, textile, and telecom industries.

 ?The WL Ross team has extensive experience in global turnarounds and we look forward to working with them in this endeavour,? HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said.

 ?The distressed debt market runs into tens of billions of dollars in the Indian economy, which is growing at more than 7 per cent per annum. The country has new restructuring laws, a well-developed legal system and political will to implement Basel II prudential norms. 

 All these factors provide exciting opportunities and our association with HDFC will enable us to collaborate effectively with the business community and the government,? said Wilbur L. Ross, Jr, chairman and chief executive officer of WL Ross.

 Ross acted as a financial adviser tocorporate revamps worth over $200 billion, including one where it rolled up the remnants of five bankrupt US steel companies into the International Steel Group. The firm was sold earlier this year to Mittal Steel for about $4.5 billion. 

 ?India has the largest non-performing assets market in Asia, after Japan and China. Increased loan-loss provisioning by Indian financial institutions cushion them from the impact of non-performing assets, but these assets need to be acquired and restructured to allow these companies to thrive and grow. Our entry will help broaden India?s capital markets and provide the skills necessary to turn these companies around,? WL Ross managing director Ranjeet Nabha said. Nabha is responsible for WL Ross? affairs in India.

 Corporate makeovers and turnarounds are needed for companies facing bankruptcy, reorganisations, corporate spin-offs and privatisation.

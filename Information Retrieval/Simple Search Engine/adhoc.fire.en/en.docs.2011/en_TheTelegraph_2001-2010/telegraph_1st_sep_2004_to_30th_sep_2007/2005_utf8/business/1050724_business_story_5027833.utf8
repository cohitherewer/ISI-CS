 Fresh twist to VW scandal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, July 23: Theres fresh trouble brewing in Andhra Pradesh. Just when the state had heaved a sigh of relief as Volkswagen had promised it would return the 2.10 million euros that was siphoned off by its India team head Helmuth Schuster, another crisis has surfaced.

 The Andhra pradesh Lokayutka Justice R. Ramanujam has registered a suo motu case against Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation (APIIC) and its directors for misappropriation of public funds. 

 On the directions of the state government, the APIIC had released a sum of Rs 11.56 crore, equivalent to 2.10 million euros, to Vashisht Wahan as its equity participation. 

 Volkswagens Asia head Helmuth Schuster had insisted that the state government should pay the sum as a token of its interest in the proposed Vizag project. Schuster was later shown the door by Volkswagen. 

 Justice Ramanujam asked APIIC and the state finance ministry to provide all relevant files and documents with regard to the scam. The state industry secretary Lakshmi Parthasarathy, however, has refused to hand over the files and said she needed the governments permission to do so. 

 The APIIC officials added that the files were not with them right now. The investigative teams of the ombudsman today visited the offices of the industry secretary and also the APIIC premises to verify whether there was any prima facie case in the contention. 

 The Lokayukta has set a deadline of July 28 for government bodies to provide the relevant information. We will consider follow up action later, the registrar of the Lokayukta M.S.K. Jaiswal said.

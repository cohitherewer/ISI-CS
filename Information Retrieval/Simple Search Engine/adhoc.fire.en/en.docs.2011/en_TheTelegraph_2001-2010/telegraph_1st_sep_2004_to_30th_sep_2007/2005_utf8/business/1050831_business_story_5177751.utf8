 New rider in telecom FDI 

 M RAJENDRAN

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: The Union communications ministry is tagging on a rider to the governments policy decision to raise the cap on foreign direct investment in the telecom sector to 74 per cent from 49 per cent.

 The decision was taken a couple of months ago but was never notified because of strong protests from the Left. 

 To break the deadlock, the communications ministry has proposed to add a proviso that will require telecom companies to plough back a minimum of 55 per cent of the profits they earn with a lock-in period of five years to stop repatriation of earnings. 

 The move is another instance where the government has tried to accommodate the Lefts concerns over unpalatable policy changes. 

 The Left has consistently opposed the move to raise the telecom FDI limit ever since finance minister P. Chidambaram announced the move in his July 2004 budget.

 Despite Left protests, the government cleared the hike in the FDI limit in the telecom sector but then did not notify it in the official gazette. 

 The Left has been lobbying for restrictive clauses to ensure that the foreign investor does not take profits earned here out of the country. 

 The cacophony of protests prompted the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) to send back the proposal last week seeking a few amendments.

 The move to revise the draft agreement arose because a few senior members within the government had insisted that the FDI component in Indian public sector banks and public sector financial institutions should be taken into account when computing the 74 per cent FDI ceiling in the telecom sector.

 The PMO had rejected the suggestion but lobbed the issue back to the ministry to work in a few riders that would quell the disquiet over the proposed hike in the FDI cap.

 Meanwhile, the Left parties impressed upon the government that it should include a clause in the final notification to stop a large outflow of profits overseas from telecom operations. 

 Hence, a clause is now proposed to be added to make it obligatory for the investors to plough back up to a minimum of 55 per cent of the profits they earn here with a lock-in period of five years from the date of notification.

 The communications ministry officials said, We will soon circulate the revised draft note to the ministries concerned and then send it to the cabinet.

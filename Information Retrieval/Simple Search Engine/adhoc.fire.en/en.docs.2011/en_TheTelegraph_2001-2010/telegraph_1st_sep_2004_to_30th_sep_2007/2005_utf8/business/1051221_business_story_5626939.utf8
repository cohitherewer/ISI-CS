 REL to invite bids for Dadri project

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 20: Reliance Energy Generation Ltd, the Anil Ambani-run utility firm, will invite domestic and international bids for selecting an equipment supplier for its 5600-mw Dadri power project in Uttar Pradesh.

 It will be the worlds largest combined-cycle power project. Reliance Energy today told stock exchanges that it has already acquired most of the land and statutory clearances, including approval from the ministry of environment and forests, for the project.

 The company is now set to invite bids nationally as well as internationally for selecting the equipment supplier for the project through the international competitive bidding process. Advertisements to this effect will be released this week, it said.

 The project, once completed and commissioned, is expected to cater to the huge demand-supply gap of the northern region. It will mainly supply power to Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab and Rajasthan, the company added.

 Considering the sheer scale of the project, analysts expect the order size to be huge.

 Reports suggest that some of the leading power generation equipment players, including GE, Siemens, Alstom and Mitsubishi, are likely to submit their tenders for the project. 

 The EPC contract for the project itself could be well over Rs 9,500 crore. The plant is expected to be commissioned by December 2008.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

See-saw soprano

One is the reform evangelist, the other a dream merchant. 

This time, they team up to author an opus that promises to open a new chapter 

in the reforms story

FISCAL POLICY

Goal: Eliminate revenue deficit of the Centre 

by 2009 

Achievement: This is an objective enshrined 

in the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (2003). The act stipulates 

that the revenue deficit must be reduced by a minimum of 0.5 per cent of GDP per 

annum. The original deadline of March 31, 2008, for the elimination of the revenue 

deficit has been pushed back by a year. However, for 2005-06, the process of correction 

has been halted. The budget estimate for 2004-05 was Rs 76,171 crore (or 2.5 per 

cent of GDP). BE for 2005-06 is Rs 95,312 crore. 

Goal: Subsidies will be made explicit and provided 

through the budget. All subsidies to be targeted sharply at the poor and the truly 

needy. 

Achievement: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh 

announced on February 10 that the government would formulate a national subsidies 

policy within six months to ensure that the benefits reach the targeted section 

of population and do not end up as wasteful spending. 

The measurement of the real subsidy poses problems 

because of implicit subsidies that are paid out in the form of tax exemptions. 

Total central government subsidies, as a proportion of GDP, amounted to 4.25 per 

cent in 2002-03 and 4.18 per cent in 2003-04. 

Only a part of the central government subsidies is 

clearly visible in the budget document. Such explicit subsidies, mainly on food, 

fertiliser and petroleum, account for about 38 per cent of total government subsidies. 

Goal: Undertake major tax reforms designed 

to expand the base of taxpayers and increase tax compliance. 

Achievement: The country has a very small taxpayer 

base: finance minister Chidambaram said there were 2.7 crore assessees in his 

July 2004 budget speech. The government wants to triple that number. It can?t 

bite the bullet and tax farm incomes; the only way is to increase tax compliance. 

The UPA government has yet to come up with a credible plan to widen the tax net. 

Corporate and income taxes together account for Rs 139,365 crore (BE for 2004-05) 

or 43.8% of the countrys total tax revenue of Rs 317,733 crore. 

Goal: Special schemes to unearth black money 

and assets to be introduced. 

Achievement: Both the reformists in the UPA 

government ? Manmohan Singh and P. Chidambaram ? had come out with amnesty schemes 

in the budgets for 1991 and 1997, respectively, to flush out black money. The 

common minimum programme talks about it. 

INDUSTRY

Goal: FDI to be actively sought particularly 

in areas of infrastructure, high-technology and exports. Increase FDI flows by 

2 to 3 times. 

Achievement: Foreign direct investment (FDI) 

inflows have been stuck at around $4 billion. After a bitter wrangle with the 

Left, the government has been able to ram through its proposal to raise the FDI 

cap in telecom and civil aviation. The next big push will be in banking, retailing 

and insurance ? all huge red rags for the Left. 

BANKING

Goal: Public sector banks will be given full 

managerial autonomy. 

Achievement: The government is trying hard 

to come good on its promise despite the opposition from the Left. Days before 

presenting the budget, finance minister P. Chidambaram came out with a notification 

giving state-run banks the freedom to buy out domestic and foreign banks, merchant 

bankers and finance corporations without having to seek prior government approval. 

The government has been planning to introduce a swathe of reforms that include 

permission to foreign banks to hold up to 74 per cent of the equity in private 

banks against the current level of 49 per cent. The notification also allows banks 

to recruit top professionals and pay them fancy salaries if they so want to. 

CAPITAL MARKETS

Goal: Financial markets will be deepened. Foreign 

investors will continue to be encouraged. 

Achievement: The sustained inflow of FII funds 

have fuelled the bull rally on the markets all through last year. With 665 FIIs 

registered with Sebi, the going seems to be good this year: since January 2005, 

net investment by the FIIs has touched $1.67 billion (or Rs 7369.6 crore). The 

grand total for net FII investment in the country since the doors were thrown 

open amounts to $33.8 billion. 

JOBS

Goal: Provide at least 100 days of employment 

a year to one member of every poor household at the minimum wage. 

Achievement: The pilot scheme was launched 

in Andhra Pradesh last August and the government intends to take it nationwide 

in phases. The law ministry is working on a legislation that will be introduced 

in Parliament to make the promise legally binding. This is one of the key planks 

of the UPAs common minimum programme, but there are too many loose ends 

that need to be tied up before it can take a credible shape. 

SAVINGS

Goal: Interest rates will provide incentives 

both to investors and savers, particularly pensioners and senior citizens. 

Achievement: Interest have stabilised somewhat 

after showing signs of a slight uptrend last year that prompted housing finance 

companies to nudge up rates by 25 to 50 basis points. With gilt yields hovering 

around 6 per cent, the government has had little leeway in talking up rates. However, 

it has announced a 9.5 per cent interest on EPF deposits with retrospective effect 

from 2001-02 and desisted from cutting the 8 per cent rate on the Special Deposit 

Scheme (where EPF managers park 80 per cent of funds). 

LABOUR

Goal: Rejects the idea of automatic hire and 

fire. However, labour laws other than the Industrial Disputes Act that create 

an Inspector Raj will be re-examined and procedures harmonised and streamlined. 

Trade unions will be consulted on the labour law changes 

Achievement: This is a potentially inflammatory 

issue that could wreck the governments fragile relationship with the Left 

and the trade unions. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister has put this on the six-month 

business agenda for his government that he unveiled early this month. The government 

wants to take a first tentative step in this direction by creating a new set of 

labour laws in the special economic zones (SEZs) but is being thwarted by the 

Left.

STATES

Goal: Interest rates on loans to states will 

be reduced and the share of states in the single, divisible pool of taxes enhanced. 

Achievement: The government has acted on this 

objective just before the budget by accepting in toto the recommendations of the 

Twelfth Finance Commission. As a result, the states share from the central 

pool of taxes will go up to 30.5 per cent from the current level of 29.5 per cent. 

The Centre will suffer a Rs 26,000 crore hit in 2005-06 as a consequence of the 

decision. The finance commission had also suggested debt relief by rescheduling 

all outstanding loans of central loans to states totalling Rs 1,28,795 crore. 

Under the scheme, the Centre will reschedule all loans with a fresh tenure of 

20 years and a lower interest rate of 7.5 per cent against the current rate of 

9 per cent. The debt relief will work out to Rs 21,276 crore in interest payments 

and another Rs 11,929 crore in repayments during 2005 to 2010. 

PUBLIC SECTOR

Goal: Profit-making companies will not be privatised. 

All privatisations will be considered on a transparent and consultative case-by-case 

basis. Existing navaratna companies to remain in the public sector 

but will be allowed to raise resources from the capital market 

Achievement: The dreaded P-word spells trouble 

for the UPA government which pared its budget estimate for divestment proceeds 

to just Rs 4,000 crore in 2004-05. The Left is opposed to the selloff of the governments 

stake in PSUs, especially profit-making ones. The government is now talking of 

partly diluting its stake by allowing more PSUs to go to the capital market.

AGRI SECTOR

Goal: Farmers all over the country will receive 

fair and remunerative prices. The terms of trade will be maintained in favour 

of agriculture. The burden of debt and high interest rates on farm loans eased 

Achievement: The NDA government?s India Shining 

campaign ahead of the general elections last May had incensed the farm lobby which 

felt it had been left out of the party. It voted with its feet and brought the 

UPA government to power. This is why the entire emphasis of Chidambaram?s budget 

has been to focus on ways to improve conditions in the farm sector. But articulating 

goals is one thing, delivering them is quite another. The government has had several 

rounds of meetings with banks and Nabard to step up cheap farm sector loans during 

the year. But its even more ambitious to talk of turning the terms of trade 

in favour of agriculture: it has been skewed against the farm sector for decades 

and it will be hard to restore the balance in a strongly consumerist economy.

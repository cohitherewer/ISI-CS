 Deeper coal seams to yield gas

 SUJATA SINGH ROY

 Calcutta, Feb. 27: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) plans to enter into a joint venture with Coal India (CIL) for an underground coal gassification project in the country. 

 ONGC has approached Coal India to forge an alliance for the project. ?Since Coal India owns a majority of the coal mines in the country, we are seeking their partnership in this project,? said D. M. Kale, executive director, Institute of Reservoir Studies, which is run by ONGC. 

 The Coal India board has cleared the project proposal at its meeting on February 10. Following this, the proposal will be sent to the Union coal ministry for its approval, said Coal India sources.

 The coal major will sign a memorandum of understanding with ONGC after receiving the ministry?s approval.

 The gas major had initially offered Coal India a 10 per cent stake in the project as a discovery cost for the coal, provided CIL did not take part in the project. This could be enhanced to 40 per cent subject to Coal India sharing 30 per cent of the cost of the project, sources said.

 However, Coal India was not keen on a mere 10 per cent stake. It wanted half of the stake in the joint venture with ONGC, sources said. 

 ?We are looking at sharing the investment equally. Also, we may want 60 per cent of the revenue from selling the gas produced using the underground coal gassification (UCG) process,? the sources added. 

 Last month, Kale had met senior Coal India officials and discussed the prospects for an equal-stakes joint venture for the UCG project. The cost of setting up an UCG station at a pilot site is around Rs 70 crore to Rs 100 crore, Kale said. 

 There are substantial coal reserves that are lying idle 700 metres to 1,000 metres below the ground level. ?It is not possible to mine the coal at such depths. For deeper coal seams, UCG is the only feasible technology for economic exploitation,? said Kale. 

 Both ONGC and Coal India are upbeat about producing gas through the UCG process. ?If we can utilise this coal, it will ensure the energy security of the country,? Coal India sources said.

 ?UCG is a process to convert the deeply-buried unmineable underground coal/lignite into combustible gases by gassifying the coal in situ. It is a chemical process in which coal is subjected to gassification agents ? air, oxygen and steam. The coal is converted from solid to a mixture of gases, liquids and ash by heat and chemical reactions. The produced gases are a mixture of combustible (carbon monoxide, hydrogen and methane) and non-combustible gases,? Kale explained. 

 The gases thus produced can be utilised as fuel gas and for power generation and as a feedstock for liquid fuels and petrochemicals. The UCG product can be converted into liquids suitable for feedstock like naphtha and transportation fuels like aviation turbine fuel, kerosene, diesel. 

 ONGC aims to start commercial production of UCG and market the gas by 2008. It had entered into an agreement with Russia?s Skochinsky Institute of Mining in November for technical collaboration in UCG.

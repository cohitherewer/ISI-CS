 IMF cautions on forex use

 Mumbai, March 17: The International Monetary Fund today said the country?s foreign exchange resources should not be used for developing the infrastructure.

 The use of the Reserve Bank?s resources (forex) was not advisable to finance domestic infrastructure projects, said IMF managing director Rodrigo de Rato. ?IMF understands that this is also the position of the Indian government on the issue (funding of infrastructure).?

 The process of spending out of budgetary resources should be transparent, he said. 

 Later speaking to reporters, the IMF chief said the world economy was expected to grow at over 4 per cent in 2005, driven by dynamic Asian economies, despite the rise in oil prices.

 IMF has called for bold steps, including reducing government borrowings and fiscal deficit, if India seeks to sustain a trend growth rate of 6-8 per cent that could double average incomes in the country in about 11-16 years.

 ?I believe that bold steps are now needed for India to take full advantage of this moment of opportunity,? Rato said. 

 Emphasising on the need to put India?s public finances on solid footing, he said government borrowings have to be reduced to help free resources for private investment, which remained low by regional standards.

 Lower fiscal deficits would improve the financial intermediation, he said, adding, Indian banks currently hold about one-third of their assets in the form of government securities, compared with 8 per cent in Singapore and 15 per cent in Thailand.

 ?If this century is to be the Indian century, it will be driven in large part by the private sector, and the government must focus on creating conditions to allow productive activity to flourish,? he said.

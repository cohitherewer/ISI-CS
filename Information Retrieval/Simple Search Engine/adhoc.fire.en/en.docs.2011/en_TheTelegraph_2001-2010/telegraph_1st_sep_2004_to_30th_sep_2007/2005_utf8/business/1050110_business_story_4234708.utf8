 MTNL protest call on rural fee cut

 New Delhi, Jan. 9 (PTI): Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) would take a hit of Rs 450 crore annually because of the new rates of access deficit charge (ADC) announced by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and said it would ?protest? against the new regime. 

 ?The ADC was available to MTNL since last two years and Trai was convinced about this... On what basis now we have been denied this compensation?? chairman and managing director R. S. P. Sinha said. ?We will protest against the new regime,? he added.

 Asked whether MTNL would approach the telecom tribunal (TDSAT) or Trai, Sinha said, ?We are still working out the numbers. One thing is certain that we shall protest against it to Trai.? 

 Sources said MTNL?s revenue loss could go up to Rs 700 crore because of the new ADC rates. Sinha declined to comment on it. 

 Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd has also claimed taking a revenue hit of Rs 1,254 crore per annum and warned of various rural telephony projects getting derailed, thereby upsetting the government?s target of connecting 6 lakh villages. 

 BSNL officials said they were working on the next course of action and were in the process of seeking legal opinion on the matter. 

 BSNL officials said they would take a final decision by the middle of this month as to whether they would approach TDSAT or file a review petition with the regulator.

 BSNL is the only telecom company which has been investing in the unprofitable rural operations and has spent Rs 40,000 crore between 2001 and 2004 and therefore, any loss in the ADC could affect the corporation?s plans in the years to come.

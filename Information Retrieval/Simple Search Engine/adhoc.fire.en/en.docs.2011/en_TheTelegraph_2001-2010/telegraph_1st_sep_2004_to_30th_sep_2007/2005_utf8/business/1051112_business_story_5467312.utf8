 Govt clears air on ELSS tax status

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 11: The government today clarified that the existing equity linked savings schemes (ELSS) offered by mutual funds would continue to enjoy tax benefits under section 80 C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

 The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has clarified that investments made on or after April 1, 2005, which are in accordance with ELSS 1992 or ELSS 1992 as amended in 1998, will be eligible for tax benefit under section 80 C of the Income Tax Act, 1961, a finance ministry statement said.

 ELSS has gained popularity among mutual fund investors because of higher returns, easy exit option and tax benefits. 

 A CBDT notification issued earlier in the month had created confusion among mutual funds and investors alike. The notification has implicitly imposed entry and exit restrictions on new ELSS plans.

 The present corpus of ELSS of all mutual funds taken together is estimated to be in the region of Rs 3,500 crore.

 Investors and mutual funds had sought clarification whether the new ELSS plans have to be close-ended schemes and whether they have to be wound up within 10 years after the allotment of units.

 This years finance bill had scrapped section 88 of the income tax act and introduced a new section 80 C that would give a tax deduction of Rs 1 lakh if investments were made in notified instruments such as PPF and NSC.

 While instruments such as PPF and NSC have been notified, the CBDT circular issued on November 3 had created a flutter in the industry about the status of the existing ELSS plans as tax-saving instruments.

 Finance ministry officials have said tax benefits of ELSS would continue.

 The ELSS plans have been one of the major drivers of the mutual fund industry in the last couple of years because of higher returns. In fact, market analysts said ELSS had been the primary driver in bringing back confidence of the small investors in the capital markets after the securities scam in 2001.

 Most mutual funds have offered robust returns, especially in the last one year, with some of them giving returns of over 50 per cent to investors.

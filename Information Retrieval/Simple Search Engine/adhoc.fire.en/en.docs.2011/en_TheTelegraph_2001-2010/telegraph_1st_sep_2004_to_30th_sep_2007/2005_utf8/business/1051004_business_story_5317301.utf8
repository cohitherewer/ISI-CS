 NTL to buy Telewest 

 London, Oct. 3 (Reuters): British cable operator NTL has agreed a long-awaited deal to buy smaller rival Telewest for $6 billion in a move to compete more effectively with the likes of BSkyB and BT.

 NTL said on Monday it is paying $23.93 ? $16.25 in cash and 0.115 NTL shares ? for each Telewest share. It is also taking on ?1.7 billion ($3 billion) of Telewest debt.

 NTL and Telewest, both of which are listed on the Nasdaq, have customers in about 5 million UK households, compared with nearly 8 million for BSkyB. The company will also be Britains second-largest residential telephone company behind the BT Group.

 NTL chief executive Simon Duffy said the deal would allow the combined company to cut ?1.5 billion in costs, accelerate the launch of products such as video on demand, and mount an aggressive advertising campaign to win new subscribers for its triple-play offering of voice, TV and Internet.

 He also signalled that NTL would keep Telewests Flextech content division, which includes channels such as Living TV and UKTV. Telewest had put up Flextech up for sale prior to Mondays announcement.

 Content channels are highly sought after due to the growing popularity of free-to-air television platforms such as Freeview, which recently surpassed cable in terms of UK households. In a TV market where our major competitor Sky uses content as a strategic weapon and where there is a big issue between free-to-air and pay TV ... having strategic control of an asset of the quality and calibre of Telewests TV content ? I think thats something that we need to retain, Duffy said.

 Telewest had shortlisted bidders, including BSkyB and pan-European television broadcaster RTL, which also owns Britains Channel Five, to go through to a second round of bidding for Flextech. The unit was expected by analysts to fetch as much as ?1 billion.

 The combination of NTL and Telewest had long been considered a foregone conclusion after both firms emerged from restructuring two years ago.

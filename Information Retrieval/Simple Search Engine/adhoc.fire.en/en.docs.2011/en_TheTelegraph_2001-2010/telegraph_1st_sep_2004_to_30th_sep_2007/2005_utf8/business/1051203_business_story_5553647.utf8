 CLB dates queer Haldia truce pitch 

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Purnendu: Whats on?

 Calcutta, Dec. 2: Exactly a week after the warring promoters of Haldia Petrochemicals ? the Bengal government and The Chatterjee Group ? initiated a truce move, the company law board (CLB) today announced fresh dates for hearing the petrochem majors case. 

 The Bengal government had set withdrawal of the CLB case as a pre-condition to a compromise deal with Purnendu.

 With fresh hearing dates of January 12 and 13 being announced, it is clear that Purnendu has not taken back his case. The hearing scheduled for November 21 was post-poned as CLB chairman S. Balasubramanian was unwell.

 The TCG chief had an hour-long discussion with state industry minister Nirupam Sen on November 25 where he said he was eager to hold truce talks with the state.

 Purnendu wanted to strike a compromise deal. But we are yet to hear from him. He has not put forward a proposal outlining the contours of the deal, senior officials at Writers Buildings said.

 The state government has taken an in-principle decision to maintain status quo and continue with the case at CLB. We would like to hear from Purnendu what he wants from us. Only then can we take a decision on the issue.

 Meanwhile, the Industrial Development Bank of India, the lead banker of HPL, is interested in the settlement formula being worked out. 

 IDBI officials have met HPL managing director Swapan Bhowmik and discussed the performance of the company. We also spoke on the present move of both shareholders ? Purnendu and the Bengal government, IDBI officials said from Mumbai.

 IDBI is interested in the outcome of the case as CLB has restrained the company from allotting shares worth Rs 135 crore to IDBI till the disposal of the case. 

 The case deals with the issuance of HPLs shares to IOC. 

 TCG had approached the CLB to have the Bengal governments share sale to IOC rescinded. It did not succeed, but another share allotment worth Rs 135 core to IDBI was stalled till the case was resolved.

 Tata Chem bid to buy out SCL

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Feb. 24: Tata Chemicals has bid to buy out the SK Birla-promoted Saurashtra Chemicals Ltd (SCL), which has been put on the block by Asset Reconstruction Company India Ltd (Arcil).

 The company, which makes heavy chemicals like soda ash, refined sodium bi-carbonate and caustic soda, was once part of Birla VXL Ltd. It was demerged into a separate company in 1999.

 Tata Chemicals officials confirmed that it has put in a bid for the ailing SCL.

 The last date for filing bids ended last week and there has been a number of suitors for the company.

 Arcil sources said the deal would be concluded in a few months. ?Generally, such a procedure takes time. But we have received good bids for SCL. We are hopeful,? they added.

 Industry observers said Tata Chemicals would be able to consolidate its position in the heavy chemicals market if it manages to outbid others. 

 Two companies have synergies not only in product line but also in the location of plants, which are concentrated in Gujarat.

 SCL reported a turnover of Rs 270 crore in 2003 with a loss of Rs 22 crore. Its paid-up capital was Rs 32.65 crore with a negative net worth of Rs 136.58 crore. It has a borrowing of Rs 240 crore. 

 The company has been delisted from the bourses a few years ago.

 At the time of demerger from Birla VXL, shareholders of the company received one fully paid share of Rs 10 of SCL on a par for every two held in Birla VXL.

 SCL has two plants producing soda ash, refined sodium bi-carbonate and caustic soda. 

 Its soda ash capacity is 3,65,000 tonnes, while that for refined bi-carbonate is 26,400 tonnes.

 Tata Chemicals, on the other hand, has a turnover of about Rs 2,500 crore. It is one of the largest producers of soda ash in the world. 

 Its Mithapur plant is located in the Dwarka sub-division of Gujarat. It started in 1930s with a capacity of 33,000 tonnes per annum (tpa) of soda ash. 

 The plant has since grown into a chemical behemoth with an installed capacity of 8,75,000 tpa ? about 34 per cent of the countrys capacity ? making it one of the largest producers of synthetic soda ash in the world.

 Moreover, the company also produces caustic soda, bromine and gypsum and cement. It has a fertiliser division as well.

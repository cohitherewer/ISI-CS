 Hansa Flex in JV with local firm

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 6: Hansa Flex International GmbH has entered into a joint venture with the city-based JDS Technologies.

 The German engineering firm will hold a 74 per cent stake in the new company ? Hansa Flex JDS Hydraulic India Private Limited ? while the remaining 26 per cent will be held by JDS Technologies.

 The working capital for the project at Salt Lake will be financed by Hansa Flex International. The company will initially design hydraulic systems suitable for plant engineering and complex material handling equipment. It would initially limit its activities to assembling imported hardware. But, it plans to switch to indigenous hardware over the next five years. We expect to achieve a sales target of 10 million euros during the first five years of operations, said Dilip Chatterjee, managing director, JDS group. We want to develop a control system from Calcutta for our entire logistic and inventory management, said Thomas Armerding, MD of Hansa Flex GmbH.

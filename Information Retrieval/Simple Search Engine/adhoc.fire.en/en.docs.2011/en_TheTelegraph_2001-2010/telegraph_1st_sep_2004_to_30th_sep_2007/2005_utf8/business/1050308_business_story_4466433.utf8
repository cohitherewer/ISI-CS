 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bindal: The big idea

 New Delhi, March 7: Japan?s craze with ?mobile pets? is coming to India. 

 If you are a pet lover but live in a house too small to keep a pet ? get a virtual pet. 

 AirTel today announced the launch of virtual pets on mobile.

 You can feed the virtual pet fish at a designated time, play with it, change the water of the virtual fish tank at regular intervals. If the pet is neglected, there is a possibility that the pet fish might die. To get a new pet fish, you would then need to download it again from AirTel Live.

 The mobile pet facility service ? which is being targeted at kids between 13 to 20 years old who constitute about 12 per cent of the cellular subscriber base ? will be available between Rs 50 and Rs 99 per download.

 Such mobile applications are popular in Japan and South Korea. 

 About 6 million of the total mobile subscriber base of 50 million are in the youth category. 

 To experience the service, an AirTel customer using a general packet radio service (GPRS) connection just needs to download the mobile pet from the AirTel Live portal. After downloading, a mobile pet, say a fish, customers would need to take care of their virtual pet, just like they would do to a real pet fish. 

 AirTel Live portal is a multi-access entertainment portal on the mobile phone which offers a variety of content in the arena of movies, music, cricket and mobile games for all its customers. 

 The mobile pets on offer at present include a dog and a fish. Subsequently, it will offer other pet options.

 According to Atul Bindal, chief marketing officer and director, Bharti Cellular Ltd, quot;Customers are increasingly looking for new means to be engaged and entertained through their mobile devices. 

 ?The launch of the virtual pet service by AirTel for the first time in the country represents our latest attempt to go beyond the already popular mobile content, which includes ring tones, wallpapers, games. I am confident that with the launch of many similar innovations by AirTel, it would redefine the mobile telephony experience of all our customers. quot;

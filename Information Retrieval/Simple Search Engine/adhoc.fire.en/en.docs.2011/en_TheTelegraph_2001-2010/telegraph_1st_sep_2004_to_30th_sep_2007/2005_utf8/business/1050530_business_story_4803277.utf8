 PSUs lobby to retain price preference

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, May 29: Public sector chief executives are up in arms against the move by the government to limit the benefits of price preference that they have enjoyed till now while bidding for government contracts.

 The Union cabinet will meet next month to consider the recommendations of a group of ministers (GoM), which has suggested an overhaul of the price preference policy. The panel has proposed two options ? either setting a cap of Rs 100 crore on tenders to be covered by the policy or restrict the number of PSUs eligible for price preference.

 At the GoM meeting, the power ministry wanted the price preference removed altogether for PSUs bidding for contracts of companies under it.

 However, others, including finance minister P. Chidambaram, argued in favour of retaining the PSU price preference policy but in a limited fashion. While some suggested that the policy could be extended only to sick or weak PSUs, others felt a cap on the tender amount would be a better idea. 

 The cabinet will consider the entire gamut of suggestions by the GoM. 

 The current purchase-preference policy provides that when the price quoted by a public sector enterprise is within 10 per cent of the lowest valid bid (L1) in a tender, other things being equal, purchase preference is to be given to the public sector company at the L1 rates. The 10 per cent purchase preference is applicable to all tenders involving contracts of Rs 5 crore and above.

 However, PSU chiefs say that a cap will mean firms like Bhel and SAIL will be losers as most contracts for power equipment and steel for road building are huge, involving hundreds of crore of rupees. 

 Their point of view is that private players will always be able to outbid them as they routinely spend money on information on rival tenders. They point to cases like railway wagons, where private firms have formed cartels and gone in for predatory pricing to outbid PSU wagon makers. 

 It will be very easy for global giants in the power equipment business to get together to finish off Bhel by using predatory pricing as a weapon, said one PSU director. PSU chiefs say they will lobby their respective ministers to prevent dilution of preference norms at the cabinet meet. 

 Ministry officials, who favour dilution of the purchase preference norms, however, point out that PSUs cannot be mollycoddled forever.

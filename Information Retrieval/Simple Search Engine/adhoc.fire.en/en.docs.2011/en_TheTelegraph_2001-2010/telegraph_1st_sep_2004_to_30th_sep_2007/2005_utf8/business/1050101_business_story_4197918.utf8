 Oracle replaces PeopleSoft top guns

 New York, Dec. 31 (Reuters): Oracle Corp has replaced PeopleSoft Inc?s co-presidents, after taking control of the rival software maker earlier this week, according to a regulatory filing. 

 PeopleSoft co-president and chief financial officer Kevin Parker and co-president Phillip Wilmington were replaced on Wednesday, PeopleSoft said in the filing from Thursday. 

 In their places, Oracle appointed Safra Catz and Charles Phillips as co-presidents and Harry You as CFO. Catz, 43, and Phillips, 45, have been co-presidents of Oracle since January 2004, while You, 45, has been Oracles CFO since July 2004. 

 PeopleSofts board earlier this month reluctantly agreed to a sweetened $10.3 billion buyout by Oracle, relenting after an 18-month takeover fight that included courtroom battles and the ouster of PeopleSofts chief executive.

 PeopleSoft, in a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, said Duffield resigned on December 21 from his positions as director and chairman of the board, and as CEO of the company he co-founded in 1987.

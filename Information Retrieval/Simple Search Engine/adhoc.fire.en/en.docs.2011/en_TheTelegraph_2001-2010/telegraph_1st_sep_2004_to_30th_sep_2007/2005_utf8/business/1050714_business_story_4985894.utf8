 Calcutta, July 13: Uco Bank may cut the interest rate it charges borrowers in the SSI sector if they carry out a credit rating by Crisil. At present, the bank charges 10 per cent from the sector, said chairman and managing director V. Sridar. 

 Uco Bank today signed a memorandum of understanding with Crisil, which will assign ratings to the banks borrowers in the SSI sector. 

 We will recalibrate the interest for SSIs who go for the rating exercise, Sridar said.

 These ratings will be carried out under NSIC ? Crisils performance and credit rating scheme for small-scale industries.

 To help both existing and future customers of Uco Bank in obtaining ratings, Crisil is offering a discount on its standard fee structure.

 For SSIs with a turnover of Rs 50 lakh, Crisil will charge Rs 7,450 instead of Rs 19,080; for units with a turnover between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 2 crore, the charges will be Rs 9,918 instead of Rs 19,590. For above Rs 2 crore, the charge will be Rs 13,224 instead of Rs 26,120.

 The SSI sector can use this rating to build its credibility with the bank and also with customers, suppliers and collaborators. Rated SSIs will find it easier to obtain funds from the bank at appropriate terms. The rating report prepared by Crisil can be used as a self-improvement tool too, said Roopa Kudva, executive director and chief rating officer.

 Following this tie-up, Uco Bank believes that its credit to the SSI sector will increase by at least Rs 900 crore this year. The bank has kept a target of Rs 2,800 crore for SSI lending against Rs 1,953 crore in the previous year.

 Sridar said only 10 per cent of the total credit in the banking sector go to the SSI sector and it is decreasing. The gross NPA in the SSI sector is as high as 8 per cent, he added.

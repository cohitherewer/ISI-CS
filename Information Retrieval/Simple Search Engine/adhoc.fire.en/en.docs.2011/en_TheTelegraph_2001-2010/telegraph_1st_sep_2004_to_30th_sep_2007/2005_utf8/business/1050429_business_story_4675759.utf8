 Calcutta, April 28: Come September, and the information and communication technology (ICT) industry will look towards the Northeast as the first expo ? NICT 2005 ? unfolds in Guwahati.

 After the success of Infocom 2004, the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) and The Telegraph have joined hands to spread the benefits of IT and telecom in the northeastern region.

 The two-day event, from September 1 to 2, will be held on the lines of Infocom and comprise a one-day conference and two-day exhibition. The idea is to provide a networking platform for key policy makers in the government, financial institutions and the IT industry.

 The list of speakers and panelists will be finalised by June. 

 Regarding Nasscom?s partnership in the event, president Kiran Karnik said, ?The Northeast, with its high literacy level and interest in education along with English language skills, offers a considerable potential for the BPO sector. The exposition could open the doors for investment to help exploit the untapped potential of the region.?

 Karnik feels that NICT 2005 will help create greater awareness of the possibilities that IT offers. ?It could be a trigger for people interested in the IT industry and also get the industry interested in the region,? he added.

 The seminar, which will be held on the first day, will be attended by the IT secretaries from the seven northeastern states to discuss issues related to e-governance. 

 The key sessions will address issues related to e-governance, ITeS and BPO, biotechnology and technologies of the future.

 Nasscom feels that just as Infocom helped in changing the perception of Calcutta and played an important role in attracting investments, NICT 2005 could also be the starting point for showcasing the potential of the Northeast.

 Govt to offload 5% in Bhel, Maruti

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Jan. 5: The government is planning to sale small stakes in the country?s largest carmaker, Maruti Udyog Ltd, and power giant Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd by the end of March.

 Heavy industries ministry is believed to have agreed to a proposal for part divestment of the government?s equity in Bhel and Maruti in this financial year.

 The government is likely to garner as much as Rs 1,600 crore by offloading up to 5 per cent stake in both firms through market offerings. 

 The heavy industries ministry wants to reserve some portions of the offering for domestic financial institutions and small shareholders, a move likely to be accepted by the government. 

 Maruti?s initial public offering, which had hit the market in June last year, had grossed around Rs 993 crore. This was hailed as the largest public issue in the last five years.

 About 60 per cent of the issue had been allotted to retail investors, while the rest was shared by institutional investors. The issue had been over subscribed by about 10 times. 

 The Maruti IPO was also the largest issue sold through the book-building route in the country?s corporate history.

 The government is hopeful that this could be repeated through another stake-sale.

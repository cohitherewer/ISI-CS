 ONGC, Oil India miss crude output target

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Jan. 30: Both ONGC and Oil India Ltd (OIL) have fallen short of their targeted crude output for the month of December. ONGC has failed to meet its target in Assam, Mumbai High and Andhra Pradesh.

 While OIL has missed its target by 2.5 per cent, ONGC was 3.4 per cent below the goal of 2.321 million tonnes. A fire at one of the platforms in Mumbai High also led to the loss of production during December.

 The poor law and order situation in Assam has affected both companies. Senior officials told The Telegraph that bandhs by the local population have prevented men and equipment from being moved to the oilfields in time, affecting the work schedules.

 There have been occasions when local hooligans, organised in groups, approached oil company officials for having roads or bridges built in the area or even demanded jobs. 

 Both OIL and ONGC have contributed liberally for the development of the region where they are operating. A senior official said oil companies have built some roads and bridges and contributed generously to schools, colleges, hospitals and promoted sports.

 However, the scale of work required to tackle the backwardness of the region can only be undertaken by the state government. ?It is beyond the economic capacity of individual companies,? he said. 

 The state government has failed to rise to the task and the local people find oil companies a soft target in their attempt to extract concessions. 

 A few wells in the ageing Assam oilfields belonging to OIL are reported to have ceased flowing, while some are presenting technical problems.

 Similarly, the problem of ageing ONGC fields has also affected the company?s output in Andhra Pradesh where another well has ceased to produce. Efforts to revive five wells that ceased earlier have failed to bear fruit. Besides, there has been no significant contribution from new wells.

 The OIL management has targeted a 10 per cent increase in its crude output during the fiscal but niggling problems appear to be cropping up.

 Opec capacity

 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) agreed on Sunday to keep oil output limits on hold, convinced that crude prices near $50 a barrel are not stifling world growth, says Reuters.

 Opec producers took little time to settle on no change in supply quotas, despite worries among consumer nations about inflated fuel costs.

 Gone are the concerns that dominated in Opec last year about the impact of rising crude prices on the economic growth that drives demand for its oil. With inflation among the world?s big economic powers in check and low interest rates still generating above trend growth, ministers see no reason for cheaper oil.

 ?I am comfortable with the market between $45 and $55,? said Edmund Daukoru, Nigeria?s presidential adviser on energy. ?Between $45-$55 (for US crude) has not affected global economic growth.?

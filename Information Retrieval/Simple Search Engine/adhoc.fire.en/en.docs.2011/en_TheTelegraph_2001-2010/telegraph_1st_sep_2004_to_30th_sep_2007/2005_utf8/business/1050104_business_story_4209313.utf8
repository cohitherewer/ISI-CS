The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Markets in flying start

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 3: The sensex gave the new year a 76-point salute as celebrations in the stock market that began late last month showed no signs of running out of steam.

 The bellwether index settled at 6679.20, extending its record run by a notch, and belying fears of a tail-off in foreign institutional money ? estimated at $8.5 billion last year. The gauge opened at 6626.49 and peaked at 6684.77.

 Even fears of a Christmas-induced slowdown in FII cash were belied when figures showed their net purchases in the first four sessions last week at Rs 579.60 crore.

 Reports of Anil Ambani?s resignation as vice-chairman and director of Indian Petrochemicals Corporation (IPCL) were overlooked in the excitement, though the exit was another evidence of the just how irreconcilable the differences between the Reliance owners are. The IPCL share itself was unaffected by the development. 

 Brokers are advising retail investors to stay cautious, pointing out that selling pressures may build in the shares of the one-time PSU following Anil?s departure.

 Other Reliance group stocks did not reflect the schism today in the way they did in the recent past. Reliance Industries gained Rs 9.30 at Rs 543.10, Reliance Energy Rs 37.45 at Rs 561.85 and Reliance Capital Rs 8.75 at Rs 140.50.

 Cement, automobiles, metals and oil were among the day?s best performers, chased by investors who see big promise in these industries in the current calendar year.

 Cement companies are expected to gain from reconstruction work in the tsunami-affected areas, while metal shares gained on the back of a price increases. SAIL decided to charge more for its products from January 1 and reports suggested Essar Steel had followed suit.

 Auto stocks zoomed as latest monthly figures showed high December demand. Shares of Hero Honda soared Rs 29.30 to Rs 600.40, Bajaj Auto Rs 11.40 to Rs 1142.85, Tata Motors Rs 14.95 to Rs 520.10, Maruti Udyog by Rs 8.15 to Rs 469.40 and Mahindra amp; Mahindra by Rs 12.65 to Rs 557.95.

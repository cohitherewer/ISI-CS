 India does a service to WTO 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nath: New heights

 New Delhi, Oct. 14: Indias issue paper on services has been accepted as the basis for the ongoing negotiations at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and is expected to help break the deadlock on opening up the sector.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath tabled the paper at a meeting of the 15-nation core group on services in Geneva on Wednesday. The meeting was co-chaired by Nath and US trade representative Robert Portman.

 The paper aims to provide a structure and focus on various issues that have to be taken up at the Hong Kong ministerial conference in December to come up with a balanced and meaningful package on services at the end of the current Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations. India has a special interest in services because of its strengths in this sector.

 The meeting was attended by ministers and senior officials of Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore and the US to find ways to impart momentum to the services negotiations and identify specific issues.

 The paper is reported to have received broad support in the core group as a basis for moving forward as it clearly outlines all the relevant issues.

 Members agreed that any complementary approach on services must supplement and not replace the existing request-offer approach, which needs to be intensified simultaneously.

 The paper points out that the approach must preserve the basic architecture of GATS (General Agreement on Trade in Services) and the flexibility it provides, particularly for developing countries.

 While all members should participate, any targets that may be agreed would not be applicable to less developed countries.

 The focus of any such approach should be improvements from the existing commitments. The special situation of newly acceded countries, which have taken extensive commitments at the time of their accession to the WTO, would be taken into account.

 The paper emphasised the need to improve the quality as well as coverage of commitments in services. The paper also identified the issue of possible numerical targets that needed discussion.

 The services package would have to include domestic regulations and that a clear direction was needed at the Hong Kong ministerial for developing a sound basis for legal disciplines at the end.

 It was decided that the issue paper tabled by India would be shared with the whole membership of the WTO for both transparency and to facilitate moving ahead in this important area of negotiations.

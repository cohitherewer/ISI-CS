The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Two board slots fall vacant

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Power meet

 Mumbai, Jan. 19: The resignations of two of the six Reliance Energy (REL) directors who quit last month ? Rakesh Jhunjhunwala and J. Ramachandran ? have been accepted. 

 The exit of Jhunjhunwala is not surprising since he had resigned as treasurer of Reliance Industries (RIL). It was the departure of Ramachandran that caught many by surprise. Jhunjhunwala, seen as a confidant of REL chief Anil Ambani, is a nominee of Reliance Power Ventures, a 100 per cent subsidiary of Reliance Industries (RIL).

 Ramachandran, a professor at IIM Bangalore, appeared hurt by accusations levelled at his independence. ?Given the recent developments and some comments regarding my independence, I thought it best to resign as a director. Higher standards of corporate governance require not independence just in terms of fact, but, more importantly, in terms of perception,? he said. Questions were raised when Ramachandran had tendered his resignation along with four other Reliance Energy directors, who were RIL nominees. 

 The vacancies created by the resignations of the two directors come a day after shareholders of REL voted in favour of an arrangement that gives Reliance Industries full power to nominate directors on the board. Until yesterday, the authority was almost fully vested in Anil.

 With the feud between the two Ambani brothers showing no signs of cooling, it is felt that the spate of resignations at the power company are an attempt by Anil to set a example for other companies in the group to ensure a greater degree of transparency in decision making.

 The four directors who withdrew their quit letters at the board?s request are Satish Sheth, J. P. Chalasani, S. C. Gupta and K. H. Mankad. According to an REL statement, Reliance Industries has re-affirmed its ?confidence in the REL board? and asked its nominees to continue.

 ?Since the boards of Reliance Industries and REL have expressed full confidence in our professionalism, it will be our privilege to serve the shareholders and stakeholders of REL under the dynamic leadership of Anil Ambani and contribute to the tremendous growth prospects of the company,? the four directors said in a joint statement after deciding to stay on.

Profit soars

 The boardroom shenanigans almost overshadowed REL?s bright third-quarter performance, in which its net profit surged 151 per cent to Rs 134.22 crore from Rs 53.41 crore for the same quarter of 2003-04. 

 Total income rose to Rs 1134.75 crore from Rs 899.94 crore. A quarterly dividend of Rs 1.10 (11 per cent) per share has been declared.

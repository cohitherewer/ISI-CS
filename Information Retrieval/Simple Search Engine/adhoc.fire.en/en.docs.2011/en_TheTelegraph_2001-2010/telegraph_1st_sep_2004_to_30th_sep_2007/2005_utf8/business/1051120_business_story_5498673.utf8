 ONGC pins high hopes on Nigerian deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Raha: Looking beyond

 New Delhi, Nov. 19: The ONGC-Mittal combine expects to produce around $10 billion worth of oil and gas every year from the Nigerian deepwater exploration blocks if all goes well. The Nigerian government will have to be given a fair chunk of the annual oil output as part of its share. 

 ONGC chairman Subir Raha told The Telegraph that negotiations would have to be carried out with the Nigerian government to arrive at a production-sharing contract.

 Terming the MoU signed with Nigerian government as a precursor ?to a very large deal,? he said, definitive agreements on various aspects of the deal and the production sharing contracts were expected to be signed in 60 days. 

 In essence, the MoU provides for the production of an average 650,000 barrels per day of oil and oil equivalent gas per year over 25 years by the ONGC-Mittal combine from the deepwater exploration blocks to be allocated by Nigerian government. The output is expected to start flowing in five to seven years and would work out to around 32.5 million metric tonnes every year. 

 The $10-billion figure is part of a back-of-the-envelope estimate on the basis of an average oil price of $40 per barrel. However, it assumes that fields will produce according to expectations and the gas will also be sold at the same price as the oil. Both these parameters can go awry in the long run given the uncertainties of the oil business. 

 The MoU signed by ONGC Mittal Energy Ltd (OMEL) and the Nigerian ministry of petroleum resources envisages several projects to address the imperatives of the government of Nigeria as well as to meet India?s surging energy requirements.

 The Nigerian government has expressed its willingness to offer OMEL the lifting rights of 120,000 barrels per day of crude oil on commercial basis. This includes 40,000 barrels per day that is currently being lifted by Indian refineries.

 Raha said implementing this aspect of the deal would start immediately as it involved buying oil that is already being produced. OMEL would sell the oil to Indian companies at commercial rates, he added.

 Responding to the expectations of the Nigerian government, OMEL has proposed to build an export-oriented refinery of 180,000 barrels per day, subject to technical and financial viability.

 OMEL has also offered to invest $6 billion in Nigeria in a 2000-mw coal or gas-based power plants, railway systems and capacity-building.

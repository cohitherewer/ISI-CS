 New ELSS on the block

The tax-exempted investment limit in equity-linked 

savings schemes (ELSS) has been hiked from the current fiscal. The benefit will 

now be available for amounts up to Rs 1 lakh under section 80C against Rs 10,000 

under the earlier section 88. Also, the existing funds in this category have posted 

phenomenal returns, thanks to the bountiful equity market.

 The result: the fund houses are queuing up to launch such funds and investors are ready to pour money into them.

 However, an investor should bear in mind that the Rs 1 lakh investment limit is not for ELSS alone, it is an overall limit and also includes investments in life insurance, provident fund, NSC, ULIP, infrastructure bonds and others.

 The two ongoing ELSS offers are from the house of Kotak Mutual Fund and Chola Mutual Fund. While Chola has launched Chola Tax Saver Fund, Kotak ELSS has coupled it with a life insurance, whereby investors can get free life cover up to twice the amount invested. Both the funds would invest 80-100 per cent of its assets in equities and up to 20 per cent in debt and money market instruments.

 Both the funds would charge an entry load of 2.25 per cent. However, the investment limit for such load varies. For Chola, investments less than Rs 25 lakh will attract a load, while for Kotak, amounts below Rs 3 crore will carry a load. All ELSS have a lock-in of three years, which the fund managers say is the reason behind these funds posting higher returns than the open-ended diversified equity funds. Both the schemes allow investments through the SIP route. There is no entry load for SIP in Chola. The new fund offer period for Chola Tax Saver will be available till October 26, while Kotak ELSS would be available till October 25.

 Indian banks score higher than Chinese

 Mumbai, Oct. 4: The Indian banking sector has a stronger financial profile than Chinese banks, which enjoy higher credit ratings, said a study jointly conducted by Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P) and its subsidiary, Crisil.

 In the report titled India top 20 banks, the two agencies have concluded that Indian banks are stronger on key fundamentals, including credit quality, pre-provisioning profitability and capitalisation, than their Chinese counterparts.

 Yet, the credit ratings on Chinese banks are higher because of the readiness of the Chinese government to provide substantial resources through capital injections and the sale of the banks non-performing assets to government-owned asset management companies.

 However, S amp;P said not withstanding these qualities of Chinese banks, they do not necessarily add to their fundamental strength. The two banking systems share certain attributes such as operating in high-growth environments, the rating agency said. Though Chinas growth historically has been the faster of the two systems, there are key differences.

 For instance, the Indian banking system is subject to relatively tighter foreign ownership restrictions whereas their Chinese counterparts are poised to benefit from the expertise they are likely to gain from an increasing number of foreign alliances through either minority stakes or technical assistance from foreign banking groups.

 However, in both these nations, the state-owned banks dominate the sector, accounting for about 70-75 per cent of financial assets in India and 55-60 per cent in China. The strong credit quality of Indian banks is in stark contrast to that of the Chinese, S amp;P said.

 Indian banks gross non-performing assets stood at an estimated 8-10 per cent of loans on March 31, 2005 compared with 31-35 per cent for Chinese banks on December 31, 2004.

 Indian banks have other strengths, too. Although the risk-management frameworks of banks in both the countries are still developing, the report ranked Indias systems higher than Chinas. 

 Chinese banks have spent several decades under policy-lending regulations that placed low priority on developing a credit-risk-management platform.

 India is also ahead in regulatory initiatives to bolster loan quality.

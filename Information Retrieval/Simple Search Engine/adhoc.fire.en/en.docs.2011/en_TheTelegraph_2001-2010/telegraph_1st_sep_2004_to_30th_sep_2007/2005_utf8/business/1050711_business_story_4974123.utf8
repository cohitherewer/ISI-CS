 Q amp;A

 Forced entry

 I had a householder policy, but my claim was rejected when I sought compensation for a burglary in our house. The maid had a key and burgled our house when we were away. Can I contest the rejection by the insurance company?

 S. Srinivasan, Guwahati

 der householder insurance, to be able to claim a loss for burglary, one has to prove that the loss followed forced entry. This could be a broken lock or window forced open or any such sign of forced entry. So, in this case since you yourself handed the keys to the burglar, the insurer rejected your claim. In the absence of a forced entry, the insurer must have classified the incident as theft, which is excluded under most policies.

 Deduction rule

 Can the amount of savings put in NSC, MIS, Post Office Time Deposit, PPF and senior citizens savings scheme, within the limit of Rs 1 lakh, be deducted from total income before calculating the income tax for 2005-06?

 R. Moitra, Jamshedpur

 The amount invested in NSC and PPF is allowed as deduction from the total income, subject to the limit of Rs 1 lakh. However, in PPF you can invest up to Rs 70,000 a year. 

 Health hazard

 Can any type of medical expenses up to the limit of Rs 40,000 (Rs 75,000 for senior citizens) be deducted from total income before calculating the income tax?

 Hemen Bera, Calcutta

 Not every medical expense is allowed as deduction. Only some expenses on specified ailments can be deducted.

 In a real hurry

 I wish to invest in equity-linked savings scheme through SIP. What is the minimum period of investment under this method?

 Robert Paul, Calcutta

 The investment period in equity-linked savings scheme is three years. However, the minimum period of investment through SIP is generally six months and the lock-in will be calculated on a first-in-first-out basis.

 World Bank sees growth at 8%

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: The World Bank today said India would clock an 8 per cent growth this fiscal, but urged the government to open up the economy further to reach the 10-per-cent mark.

 According to World Bank vice-president (South Asia) Praful Patel, there is a very good chance of the economy to grow by 8 per cent this fiscal as the overall economic situation is very positive.

 India has recorded an 8 per cent growth rate for the second successive quarter this fiscal raising hopes about the economy entering a high growth trajectory.

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recently raised the bar and set a target of 10 per cent within two to three years.

 The distance of 8 per cent to 10 per cent is very much achievable provided the government unveils policies that encourage more inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) and envisages a larger role for the private sector in the overall growth process, Patel said on the sidelines of a conference on micro-finance.

 East Asian tigers such as Korea were at a similar stage of development a few decades ago as India is at present and these countries maintained high growth rates by carrying out major infrastructure projects, Patel said.

 The public-private partnership model for infrastructure development needs to be further encouraged and public investment in agriculture stepped up, he said.

 We are ready to support India in the agriculture sector, Patel said referring to the vast majority of poor people living in rural India.

 He said the banks activities had shifted to urban development and infrastructure in recent years, but it was willing to step up its activity in the farm sector.

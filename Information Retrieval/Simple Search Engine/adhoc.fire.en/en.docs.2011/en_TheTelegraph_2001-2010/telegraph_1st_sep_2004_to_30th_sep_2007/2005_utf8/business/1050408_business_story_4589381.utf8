The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Hideout of my own, not far away from 

 mom

 My first home- Sabyasachi Mukherjee. 

 Designer 

 When I came to Calcutta from Kakinara, 

 where I was born and brought up, with my family in 1991, 

 my father bought this house on Jatin Das Road. That?s where 

 I have spent all my youth. I am a person who gets bothered 

 by geographical shifts, so I don?t like to be uprooted from 

 anywhere. So when I decided to buy my own home, my primary 

 concern was to stay as close to the existing house as possible.

 In our locality, all the old Bengali 

 houses were being converted into multi-storeyed buildings, 

 but at that point of time I didn?t have the money to buy 

 apartments in those. About a year back, when the last standalone 

 house in the lane was being built into a multi-storey, I 

 bought an apartment in it.

 This apartment is across the road 

 from my previous home and overlooks my parents? living room 

 and that?s what dictated my decision to buy it.

 Another reason for buying it was 

 that it?s on the first floor and since I hate elevators, 

 that suits me fine. I can just run up and down the steps 

 whenever I want, without having to use the elevator.

 The interiors of my apartment 

 wear a very minimalist look.

 There?s only one thing I would 

 like to change about the house and that?s the size of the 

 bathrooms. I bought the ready flat and so was not involved 

 in the planning process at all. But if I had a say, I would 

 break down one of the three bedrooms and make the bathrooms 

 bigger. Anyway, since I?m single and live alone, I don?t 

 need three bedrooms.

 My home gives me a sense of security. 

 It?s my hideout that provides me the solace and privacy 

 I always look for. Whenever I don?t feel like working or 

 interacting with anyone I just hide myself in my home.

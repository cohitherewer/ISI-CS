 MCX countdown to crude futures debut

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 3: As consumers and users fret over volatile crude prices and the absence of a hedging mechanism in India, the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX) has begun a countdown to the launch of futures in the key input.

 Globally, crude futures are the most heavily traded item in the derivatives market. The New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) tots up the largest number of deals ? which are believed to be worth $8 billion daily. Volumes in London are half that; in Japan, the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (Tocom) generates crude futures contracts estimated at a similar amount.

 India is only days away from the trading milestone. Next Wednesday, petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar will launch crude futures at the MCX. The exchange is now familiarising users on the new concept in workshops.

 Jignesh Shah, managing director of MCX, said his first goal would be to surpass Tocom in daily volumes; Nymex will be next. At the moment, he is busy convincing all just why the country needs futures in oil and how it is inextricably linked to several other commodities.

 MCX officials see industries whose bottomlines are singed by volatile crude prices as their potential customers. These include refineries, airlines and glass firms. Several of them have already warmed up to the idea and are in the process of signing up, an official said.

 The number of contracts at MCX will be 12, coinciding with the number of months in a year. The trading unit is 100 barrels. You can buy a maximum of 10,000. 

 MCX will quote the rates in rupees. These would be effective in Mumbai. It will exclude taxes. The bourse has also set the maximum open position for individual clients at 100,000 barrels; collectively, members will be permitted up to 25 per cent of the open positions. The delivery unit is 50,000 barrels and the consignment will be handed at Jawahar Lal Nehru Port near Mumbai. 

 Recently, MCX had tied up with Tocom ? the second largest commodity exchange in the world ? to introduce a futures product in Indian rubber. 

 The Japanese bourse is also committed to offering inputs on crude futures. Experts say futures is information-driven trading, where prices are more logical than those in the spot segment.

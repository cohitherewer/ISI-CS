 Moody?s to upgrade Reliance rating

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 17: International rating agency Moody?s is likely to upgrade the rating of Reliance Industries following improvement in its financial position.

 Moody?s has placed Reliance?s ?Ba2? rating on review for possible upgrade. The issue of family ownership and corporate governance would also be considered for the purpose, the agency said.

 The statement by Moody?s comes amid reports that the process for a settlement on ownership issues has begun, which is based on ICICI Bank chief and family friend K. V. Kamath?s valuation report.

 The Reliance scrip, however, fell with other heavyweights in a market which was downcast due to the spiralling rates in the crude oil market. The Reliance share fell by Rs 11.60 to close at Rs 561.95 from its Wednesday?s close of Rs 573.55.

 ?The rating action has been prompted by Reliance?s improving operational fundamentals, backed by its low-cost positions and strong contributions from petrochemicals and refining,? Moody?s said in a statement. 

 Reliance exhibits strong operations and financial figures, which could support an investment-grade profile, the agency added. Moody?s also added a rider to the likely upgrade. ?Whether such a level is achievable depends on our assessment of the group?s standards of corporate governance,? it said.

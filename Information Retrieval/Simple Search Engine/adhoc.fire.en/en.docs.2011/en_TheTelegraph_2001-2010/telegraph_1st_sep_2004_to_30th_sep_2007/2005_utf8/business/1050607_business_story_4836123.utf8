 Blazing trail

 New Delhi, June 6 (PTI): Within a fortnight of launching it, Maruti Udyog has ramped up the prices of its Swift model by Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000.

 After the revision, the Swift Lxi will cost Rs 3,95,000, up by Rs 8,000 from its initial price. The Vxi model and the top-end Zxi model will come at Rs 4,15,000 and Rs 4,95,000, respectively, both increased by Rs 10,000.

 As we have said at the time of the launch the introductory prices were for a limited period and from June 9 onwards the new price will come into effect, a Maruti spokesperson said, explaining the price hike. 

 Customers who book Swift up to June 8 will be able to enjoy the introductory price, he added. So far over 18,000 customers from across the country have already placed orders for the Swift and the waiting period for the vehicle is now about three months.

 Swift, which was launched on May 25, was offered at an attractive introductory price ranging from Rs 3,87,000 to Rs 4,85,000 (ex-showroom Delhi) across the three variants.

 Meanwhile, Maruti has signed an original equipment supplier deal with Amara Raja Batteries for supplying the batteries for its Swift cars. Amara Raja will supply the Amaron batteries for all the three versions of the Swift. 

 It is a matter of pride that within a year of signing an original equipment deal with Maruti, we are now exclusive battery providers for their latest model Swift, said Jay Galla, managing director, Amara Raja Batteries. 

 Amaron batteries meet our stringent quality standards. With their state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities and quality systems, we expect the performance on the road to be good as well, Maruti chief general manager, Sudam Mmaitra said. 

 New car plant

 The foundation stone for Maruti Udyogs Rs 1,524.2-crore new car plant was laid at Manesar, Haryana today by the state chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda.

 The plant, which will initially have a capacity of 100,000 cars per annum, could be scaled up to 250,000 units. 

 It is part of a bigger investment plan chalked out by Maruti and its Japanese collaborator Suzuki Motor Corporation for the medium term. In this venture, maruti will hold 70 per cent equity while Suzuki Motor will hold the remaining 30 per cent.

 Speaking on the occasion, Maruti managing director Jagdish Khattar said, Our investment in a new car manufacturing plant underlines our parent company, Suzuki Motor Corporations continued commitment to India. It also reflects Marutis optimism about the future of the domestic car market. 

 Apart from the new car plant, fresh investments will be made in an engine and transmission facility, upgradation of the companys existing plant in Gurgaon and in new models, a company release said. 

 The new manufacturing facility, which is being set up under a joint venture company called Maruti Suzuki Automobiles India Limited, will begin commercial production by the end of 2006.

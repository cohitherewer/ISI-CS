 Clean-fuel deadline beyond reach

 New Delhi, Jan. 2 (PTI): Refiners are not prepared to meet the April 1 deadline for the introduction of petrol and diesel conforming to Euro-III emission norms in 11 cities and Euro-II grade fuel in the rest of the country, according to a government status report.

 The deadline for introduction of Euro-III grade petrol can be met through some imports but diesel of the same quality could only be introduced in six cities ? Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad ? as the fuel was not available internationally for import.

 Euro-III grade diesel supply in Ahmedabad, Pune, Surat, Kanpur and Agra would be possible only from May, according to the minutes of a meeting held on December 28 to review the preparedness of industry for introduction of clean fuel.

 Petrol of Euro-II or Bharat Stage-II grade was feasible according to the target date of April 1, but a new schedule would have to be drawn for introduction of diesel of the same quality.

 The national auto fuel policy envisages supply of diesel with 0.035 per cent sulphur and cetane number 51 and petrol with 1 per cent benzene and octane number 91 in 11 cities from April.

 A Reliance representative said the company?s Jamnagar refinery was unable to meet the clean fuel demand as ?substantial problem was being faced because of technical snag at the hydrogen manufacturing unit (HMU) and also the export commitment made by RIL,? according to the minutes.

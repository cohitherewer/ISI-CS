The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Q amp;A

 New regime

 Till last year, interest accrued on NSC was deemed to have been reinvested under section 88 and tax relief thereon was available under section 80L. After the changes made in the current year, how shall the interest be treated?

 A.N. Choudhury, Guwahati

 Interest accrued on NSC shall be deemed as reinvestment 

 under the new section 80C. However, the tax deduction 

 available under section 80L shall no longer be available 

 and the amount shall be added to the total income.

 Gifts galore

 An employee gifted Rs 3 lakh each to his two sons from retirement dues. Shall the amount be subject to gift tax? Also, shall the interest received on investing the gifted amount be subject to tax in the hands of father?

 Mihir Dasgupta, by e-mail

 Since gift to lineal descendants is free from gift 

 tax, such amount gifted to sons will not be subject 

 to gift tax. Also, the interest amount received on the 

 gifted amount, though taxable at the hands of the sons, 

 will not be taxable for the father.

 Site visit

 I wish to invest in equity-linked savings schemes of mutual funds. Can you give me e-mail ids of fund houses? 

 Mahesh G. Hegde, Mizoram

 You can visit the official websites of mutual funds and get their contact address, telephone number, e-mail id and all other necessary details.

 Rate roster

 I am a retired senior citizen. After the basic exemption limits of Rs 1,85,000 for senior citizens, my taxable income comes to Rs 39,828. At what rate shall I have to pay income tax?

 C. R. Subia, Jamshedpur

 You will have to pay tax at the rate of 20 per cent on Rs 39,828.

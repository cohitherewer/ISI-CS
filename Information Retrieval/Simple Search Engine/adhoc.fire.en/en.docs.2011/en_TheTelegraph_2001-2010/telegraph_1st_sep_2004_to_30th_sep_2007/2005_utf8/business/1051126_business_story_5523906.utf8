 Subsidy cut key to success of trade talks

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 25: India today emphasised that agriculture is central to any deal at the WTO Hong Kong ministerial and developed countries must deliver ?real? cuts in farm subsidies for the trade talks to succeed.

 ?Agriculture is central to trade talks...developed countries must deliver real cuts. As long as box shifting (shifting subsidies from one category to another) continues, the situation will not improve, no matter what developed countries say,? commerce secretary S.N. Menon said at an Assocham meeting on WTO.

 ?Only if there is convergence in agriculture will other areas like non-agriculture market access (Nama) move and there could be no trade-off,? he added. With just two weeks left for the Hong Kong ministerial, he said it should not be a failure like Cancun.

 ?This (failure) would be terrible for multilateral trade... It would be bad for the WTO as an institution and also for developing countries like India, which want inequities in global trade to be addressed,? said Menon.

 ?But with divergences remaining, the idea is to reduce expectations without reducing ambition from the ministerial,? he added.

 Menon said the draft ministerial text, which is expected by tomorrow, will be discussed at the WTO trade negotiating committee meeting on November 30 and general council in the first week of December. The second draft will be released after these meetings.

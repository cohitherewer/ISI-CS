 Super saver with cover

 DSP MERRILL LYNCH has launched Super SIP, whereby investors can save regularly through a monthly SIP and get a life insurance cover along with it. Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance provides the term insurance cover.

 The offer is available for individuals between 18 and 43 years. The life insurance cover for the initial 12 months is a nominal Rs 1,000. The insurance cover for the sum assured starts from the thirteenth month, following the first SIP instalment and remains until the end of the relevant tenure.

 Under the facility, investors will have two broad options ? a variable cover, which is available for tenures of six, 11 and 16 years and a fixed cover, which is available for 21 years. 

 Under the variable cover option, for an SIP of Rs 5,000 per month for six years (or 72 months), an investor will get a cover of 3.6 lakh (Rs 5,000 x 72 months). In the second month, his insurance cover will reduce by Rs 5,000 to Rs 3.55 lakh (Rs 5,000 x 71 months) and so on. In the event of the investor?s death during the tenure, the sum assured, over and above the value of his investments in the funds, will be paid.

 The schemes where investments can be made are DSP Merrill Lynch?s TIGER Fund, Opportunities Fund, Top 100 Equity Fund and Equity Fund. Investors can also switch over from one fund to another any number of times without a charge.

 Under the fixed cover option, the amount of life insurance, equivalent to 240 times your monthly investment, or 20 times your yearly investment, remains constant throughout the savings period. The investor can withdraw his investments without losing the life cover. Under the variable option, one can withdraw the appreciated capital part, but only after three years. The scheme provides life insurance up to Rs 20 lakh.

 Reliance demerger hearing in final lap

 Mumbai, Dec. 4 (PTI): Reliance Industries is all set for the final wrap-up of arguments before Bombay High Court tomorrow on its petition seeking approval of the proposed demerger scheme for change in the shareholding pattern as a settlement between Mukesh and Anil Ambani.

 The court has given the final opportunity to shareholder Kalpesh Bharatkumar Mankad to wind up his arguments for opposing the scheme and is likely to pass an order tomorrow, if both sides conclude their submissions, legal sources said.

 Hearing both sides, Justice Nishita Mhatre told Mankad that the court would not allow any further adjournments after tomorrows hearing.

 RIL has sought dismissal of the intervening application of the shareholder, opposing the scheme, saying he was holding to ransom the demerger process of RIL having around 20 lakh shareholders.

 RIL, the countrys largest private enterprise, further argued that the objections raised by the intervening shareholder were speculative in nature.

 Mankad argued that RIL had indulged in unfair practice towards its shareholders and saw the demerger scheme as more of a family arrangement than a business separation.

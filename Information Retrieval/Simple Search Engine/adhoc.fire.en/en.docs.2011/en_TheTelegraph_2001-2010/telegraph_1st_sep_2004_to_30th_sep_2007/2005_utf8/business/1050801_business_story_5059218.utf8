 Breaking away from tradition

 The recent fund offers from Sahara 

 Mutual Fund and Reliance Mutual Fund are indications that 

 the composition of traditional schemes are in for a change.

 Sahara Mutual Fund will follow the ?variable pricing concept? for all its future schemes starting with Sahara Wealth Plus Fund,which is on offer now. Reliance Mutual Fund is offering insurance against accidental death with its equity-linked savings scheme. 

 Sahara Mutual Fund has linked the investment management and advisory fees charged by it with the funds? performance. ?We shall offer this concept in all our upcoming schemes,? said Arindam Ghosh, chief marketing officer, Sahara Asset Management Company (AMC).

 Accordingly, investors will pay the fees only when the returns on the investment portfolio of the fund is positive. If the portfolio returns are less than that of the benchmark set for the fund (S amp;P CNX 500 in this case), Sahara Mutual Fund will charge only half of the maximum permissible fees. If the portfolio returns are greater than that of the benchmark, it will charge the maximum permissible fees. 

 What distinguishes Reliance Mutual Fund?s offer is the personal accident cover of Rs 5 lakh (maximum).

 The insurance cover is linked to the amount put in by the investor. For an investment amount less than Rs 10,000, the cover is Rs 50,000. For investments between Rs 10,001 and Rs 25,000, the insurance is Rs 2 lakh and for investments between Rs 25,001 and Rs 50,000, the cover is Rs 3,00,000. The mutual fund has capped the level of cover at Rs 5 lakh for investments greater than Rs 50,001. 

 Competition spawns choices, did you say?

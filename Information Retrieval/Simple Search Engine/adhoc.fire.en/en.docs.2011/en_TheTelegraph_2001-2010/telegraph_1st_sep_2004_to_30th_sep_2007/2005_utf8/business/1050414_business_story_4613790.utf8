 Long wait for GTB investors

 Narang: The strategist

 Hyderabad, April 13: The future of 40,000 shareholders of erstwhile Global Trust Bank (GTB) continues to be bleak even after a year of amalgamation under Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC).

 OBC chairman and managing director B. D. Narang said GTB shareholders might get back part of their investments only after six years.

 He said a part of the shareholders? stake could be returned if the bank made a surplus after wiping out the deficit and if the Reserve Bank permitted.

 GTB operations would show an operating profit in the next quarter of 2005, Narang said at a roadshow for the forthcoming IPO of OBC. 

 ?In the last quarter of 2004, GTB losses were Rs 69 crore and the first quarter of 2005 it had reduced to Rs 11 crore. By the first quarter of 2006, GTB will contribute to the bottomline of OBC,? he added.

 He said OBC proposed to set up one more regional office specifically to monitor over 104 odd branches of GTB. The bank was amalgamated with OBC along with liabilities and assets following a run on the bank in August 2004.

 Narang said except for the decisions of a couple of top GTB executives, other subordinate staff could not be blamed. ?We have not filed a CBI complaint against any individual employee but only against some customers.?

 ?We have no grudge against any of the 1000 GTB staff still working in OBC,? he said, adding that their emoluments were being reassessed by the NIBM and a final decision on the implementation of its recommendations will be made by May 15.

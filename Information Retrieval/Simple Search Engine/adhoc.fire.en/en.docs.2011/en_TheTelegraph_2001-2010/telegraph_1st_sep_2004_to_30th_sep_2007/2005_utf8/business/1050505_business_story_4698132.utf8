 Asian Drama in US auto show

 JEREMY W. PETERS 

 Wheels of change 

 Detroit, May 4: The latest 

 automobile sales figures show that Americans are increasingly 

 wary of gas-thirsty sport utility vehicles. That was particularly 

 bad news for General Motors and the Ford Motor Co, which 

 both saw their sales slip in April as consumers continued 

 their march into Asian car companies? dealerships. 

 Both Toyota and Nissan posted 

 record sales gains in April, which helped push overall auto 

 sales in North America up 1.8 per cent. 

 But even as sales were expanding 

 for the industry, they were shrinking at GM and Ford. The 

 decline was the sharpest at General Motors, the world?s 

 largest automaker. GMs sales fell 7.7 per cent from 

 the same month a year earlier, primarily because of a weak 

 demand for SUVs. The lack of appetite for SUVs also hurt 

 Ford, which sold 5 percent fewer vehicles in April compared 

 with a year ago. 

 April?s sales numbers showed no 

 signs that the pressure on Detroit from its Asian rivals 

 will let up anytime soon. That became particularly evident 

 Tuesday, as Toyota reported that April had been the most 

 successful month in its history. Its sales were up 21.3 

 per cent on big gains in the number of passenger cars sold. 

 Nissan also reported its strongest April on record. Sales 

 increased 27 per cent for the Japanese automaker, compared 

 with the same month last year. 

 ?The strength that GM and Ford 

 have had has been in traditional SUVs,? said Ron Pinelli, 

 president of the Autodata Corp. ?Now that there?s new product 

 out there, consumers are defecting? from GM and Ford to 

 companies offering the newer vehicles. 

 Ward?s AutoInfoBank projected 

 that vehicle sales in North America would reach a seasonally 

 adjusted rate of 17.4 million units this year if sales continued 

 at April?s pace, which would be a solid performance for 

 the industry. The results further suggested that the industry 

 was bouncing back from a slow start at the beginning of 

 the year.

 Vat-weary traders fear inspectors

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Staying away

 Calcutta, April 7: Traders have been spooked by fears that the value-added tax (VAT) regime will lead to a situation where they might be hounded by inspectors for minor infractions.

 In Bengal, their worst fears may just come true because of what appears to be a draconian provision in the state?s VAT rules that vests untrammelled discretionary powers in the hands of the sales tax officials. 

 For instance, sales tax officials can demand a security deposit from a dealer or any VAT assessee merely on the suspicion that he might be trying to dodge the levy.

 The sales tax official will have the power to make a determination of the security amount that should be deposited, which would usually be in the form of bonds or post office savings schemes like National Savings Certificates (NSC).

 More interestingly, the security to be deposited with the commercial tax department could be negotiated. 

 A sales tax officer can ask for security to ensure proper tax payment and safe custody of forms like way bills. It can also ask for the security in case there is a change in business. However, officials are not willing to accept that such a proviso could lead to malpractices and be used as a weapon to harass VAT assessees.

 C. M. Bachhawat, commissioner of commercial taxes, Bengal, claimed that these provisions were there for the last 40 years under the sales tax provisions and no one had complained to the authorities about gross abuse of the power. 

 ?I have not received any complaint on this score. However, we are willing to take a look at the issue if a representation on this comes to us,? he said. 

 The process works like this. A sales tax officer, based upon observations as mentioned before, proposes that a security deposit should be collected from a particular dealer to a higher official. 

 The higher official sends a notice to the dealer asking him to show cause why a security should not be imposed on the dealer. The higher official will have the power to moderate the proposal sent by the STO. The dealer can defend his case when he comes to meet the tax official at a specified date. Following the discussion, a security amount is decided. 

 Generally, the dealer buys NSCs and pledges it in the name of the senior commercial tax officer. Officials say the system was meant to check errant traders. 

 ?Cases have come to our notice where dealers are losing their way bills frequently. After goods are brought within the state, they report the loss of the way bill. This is a big tax evasion racket. We invoke a security in such cases,? the official said.

 Much more than $18 bn at stake for Chinese titan

 JEHANGIR S. POCHA

 Fu Chengyu: Firm footed

 Beijing, July 3: The China National Offshore Oil Corporations (CNOOC) $18.5-billion bid for Unocal is the largest international purchase by any Chinese firm to date, and marks the first time a Chinese firm has entered an international bidding war with an American company.

 How things unfold will make me a hero or a martyr, Fu Chengyu, CNOOCs iconic chairman and CEO had recently said. 

 If successful, the deal would turn CNOOC into a $50-billion behemoth capable of taking on global energy companies as the US, China and India scramble for global energy resources.

 If US authorities dont clear the merger, Fu could face a torrent of I told you so recriminations from rivals, which could short-circuit his extraordinary career and CNOOCs global ambitions, at least temporarily. 

 But the most worrisome scenario is that US regulators bless the deal, but the merged entity collapses under the weight of internal frictions and the massive debt taken on to fund the deal. 

 Some experts, such as William Overholt, director of the Center for Asia Pacific Policy at the Rand Corporation, say CNOOC is overpaying for Unocal just as Japan paid over the top for everything from Rockefeller Center to Pebble Beach to most of the hotels in Los Angeles and much of the real property in Hawaii during the 1980s. 

 But shares in CNOOC Ltd, CNOOCs Hong Kong-based listed subsidiary, have risen about 7 per cent over the last week. 

 Much of that market optimism is rooted in the US-educated Fu. In many ways his success story reflects Chinas own. 

 Since becoming president of CNOOC Ltd in December 2000, he has doubled the companys net worth to $23 billion. Last year alone, the company purchased energy fields in Australia, Indonesia and Alberta, Canada, boosting revenue by 30 per cent, to $6.7 billion, and net profit 40 per cent, to $1.95 billion. 

 Much of that success is credited to Fus open and easy going management style in contrast with most Chinese state-owned companies, which are extremely protocol conscious and notoriously private. Their CEOs seldom mix with the outside world and shun publicity almost as assiduously as their contemporaries in the US seek it. 

 Fu is a very confident guy, said Han Xiaoping, senior vice-president of Falcon Pioneer Technology Co Ltd, an energy research firm in Beijing. He likes to wear American labels, and in a sense hes very, very Americanised.

 Under Fu, CNOOC began conducting meetings in English, and Fu brought four independent directors, including two Westerners, Evert Henkes, a former Shell executive, and Kenneth S. Courtis, vice-chairman of Goldman Sachs in Asia, onto its board. That, among other things, has allowed CNOOC to keep itself free of the nepotism and inertia that plagues many Chinese state enterprises. 

 That Fu knows what it takes to succeed in the US is evident from the troops CNOOC has lined up in Washington. Top investment bankers Goldman Sachs and J. P. Morgan were hired to structure the Unocal deal and CNOOCs public relations are being handled by a firm called Public Strategies, whose vice chairman, Mark McKinnon, managed President Bushs media campaign in the last election. 

 Aware of the implications of buying a US oil company when oil prices are over $60 a barrel and Americans are worried about loosing jobs to China, Fu has promised not to divert any of the energy Unocal supplies the US to China, and retain all Unocals US employees. He has also said CNOOC could sell Unocals North American assets, including the USs only rare-earth mine and a pipeline connected to the USs strategic petroleum reserve, to US companies, and consider special management arrangements for its controversial pipeline projects.

 Han said that proves CNOOC is not interested in challenging the US and that Unocal bid is driven by Chinas goal of increasing the share of natural gas in its energy mix from 3 per cent to 10 per cent, mostly to curb pollution. 

 Unocal owns about 1.2 billion barrel equivalent of gas reserves in 14 countries, mostly in Asia. The company has Asias largest stores of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which CNOOC needs for new LNG terminals it is building along Chinas coastline. For this, CNOOC has still not secured supplies. Unocal also owns specialised deep-water drilling technology that CNOOC needs to explore its own gas reserves. Thats worth a premium, Han said.

 But Fus fondness of the limelight leads some experts, such as Michael Pettis, associate professor of finance at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University, to suggest his pursuit of Unocal may be fuelled by a trophy instinct.

 Initially, the CNOOC board was divided over whether to pursue Unocal, and Overholt said there are indications that Fu convinced the board to go through with the deal because he wanted to please Chinas top leaders with a prize acquisition, regardless of how attractive it really was in the long run. 

 Indeed, the Unocal deal will be financed by subsidised loans from the Chinese government. CNOOC will get $2.5 billion interest-free and $4.5 billion at 3.5 per cent. Significantly, thats even less than the 4.2 per cent a 30-year US treasury bond pays.

 Despite Fus record of getting what he wants, there is a very real worry that the US might reject CNOOCs bid. Last year, Hong Kong-based telecommunications firm Hutchison Communications was prevented from buying bankrupt US telecommunications firm Global Crossing for security reasons by the US Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a panel made up of top US national security and economic officials that scrutinises foreign investments into the US.

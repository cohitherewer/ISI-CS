 Mumbai, June 7: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will give more freedom to banks in matters of extending financial assistance to Indian companies for acquisition of equity in overseas joint ventures or setting up wholly-owned subsidiaries or in other companies. 

 In a notification issued today, the central bank said it would allow banks to extend financial assistance to Indian companies for equity acquisitions abroad as strategic investment, in terms of a Board approved policy, duly incorporated in the loan policy of the bank.

 The RBI added that such a policy should include the overall limit of such financing, terms and conditions of eligibility of borrowers, security, margin money among others.

 While the board of each bank may frame its own guidelines and safeguards for such lending, the apex bank added, such acquisition should be beneficial to the company and the country. 

 Further, the finance would be subject to compliance with the statutory requirements under Section 19(2) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949.

 The RBI regulations had earlier stipulated that banks should not normally grant advances to take up shares of other companies. 

 It had, however, made few exceptions have been made in this regard. One such exception is, banks may sanction term loans on merits to Indian promoters for acquisition of equity in joint ventures/wholly owned subsidiaries abroad, provided the Export Import Bank of India (Exim Bank) has approved the term loans for refinance. 

 Exim Bank provides 100 per cent refinance to commercial banks in respect of rupee term loans extended by them to Indian promoters for equity contribution in foreign joint ventures or subsidiaries.

 Therefore, while commercial banks earlier could consider loan for equity investment only under Exim Banks Refinance scheme, this restriction has now been removed, thus giving more freedom to banks.

 Inflation check

 RBI today said the rate of wholesale price inflation (WPI) is expected to remain calm in the coming months and settle around 6.5 per cent by the end of this fiscal.

 In the report on currency and finance, the central bank said monetary management faced challenges in 2004-05 mainly from an overhang of liquidity and a surge in headline inflation. It said the magnitude and persistence of supply shocks turned out to be more than what was anticipated.

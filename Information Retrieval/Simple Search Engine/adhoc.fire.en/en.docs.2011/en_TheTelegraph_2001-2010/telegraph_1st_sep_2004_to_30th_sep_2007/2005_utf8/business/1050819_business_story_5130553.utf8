 Besides its own cable, the company also shares the communications backbone with Hutch and Siti Cable.

 In the eastern region, TTSL operates in Calcutta, Bengal, Orissa and Bihar circles.

 Currently, 30 per cent of our sales in the east comes from the retail segment. We plan to take this to 40 to 50 per cent. We also plan to double the conversion rate in retail outlets from 10 per cent to 20 per cent, he added.

 The 243 retail True Value Shops (TVS) are now being upgraded to full-fledged product solution and customer care centres to cater to all communication requirements, including handset repairs, of users and will help in increasing the conversion rate.

 We plan to have 500 TVS in the east by the end of the year, added Puri. The integrated True Value Hub (TVH) centres will also be increased from four to 16.

 With an average revenue per line (ARPL) of Rs 4000 per month, the PTB business is very profitable and we are aggressively trying to grow it, he added.

 Calcutta, Dec. 7: The State Bank of India (SBI) will provide a technology platform to smaller banks through its joint venture company ? C-Edge Technologies Limited.

 SBI, the largest bank in the country, has tied up with TCS to form a joint venture company ? C-Edge Technologies. SBI plans to provide advanced technology solutions and domain consulting to the banking and financial services sector through this collaboration.

 C-Edge Technologies will provide a technology platform for regional rural banks and co-operative banks in the country. These banks cannot set up a technology backbone because of paucity of funds. We will provide them with a ready infrastructure, SBI chairman A.K. Purwar said on the sidelines of Infocom 2005 organised by Nasscom and Businessworld, an ABP group publication.

 The technology company will have an authorised capital of Rs 40 crore. Purwar said the process of forming the company has just started.

 C-Edge Technologies will focus on developing high-value niche assets and solutions by leveraging domain and technology capabilities of the two parent companies. These new assets will complement and leverage TCSs comprehensive suite of banking assets.

 TCS has recently acquired FNS, an Australian company providing banking solutions. The joint venture may also deploy FNS products as a preferred systems integrator and leverage the experience of both the organisations in rolling out core banking solutions in the State Bank group.

 Purwar, along with HDFC Bank managing director Aditya Puri, talked about the benefits of using technology in the banking operations.

 SBI, which has more than 5,600 ATMs, has witnessed a substantial increase in transactions through ATMs in the current financial year. The bank has recorded 3.3 crore transactions involving a total cash of Rs 4,300 crore till October this year. The transaction figure was at 60 lakh involving an amount of Rs 750 crore till March 2004. The bank is adding another 1,000 ATMs this fiscal.

 Pension payoff for markets

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 31: Two centuries on the trot and still going strong. The sensex raced past the 6500-mark today as excitement over the prospect of pension cash pouring into equity hung heavy over a buyer-driven stock market.

 In a 137-point gain, the 30-share index built on Friday?s 180-point scorcher and gave back Dalal Street a staggering 449.51 points since the week that began on January 25.

 Besides the optimism of seeing Rs 4000-6000 crore of pension cash sloshing about, operators were thrilled to have data that showed foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who have been sellers for much of this month, buying stocks worth Rs 632 crore ($143 million) on Friday. Figures for today, which could be higher, will be out on Tuesday.

 ?The return of FIIs is a positive sign and it comes after a round of good corporate results. This should keep the equity markets in a buoyant mode,? a broker said. An analyst with a local brokerage felt the gains would continue as expectations of a market-friendly budget grow.

 Friday was a turning point in many ways. State Bank treated investors to an unexpectedly good set of numbers, triggering a larger rally in the market. Till then, bourses had not been able to shake off their new-year blues.

 The run of rosy corporate numbers continues. Punjab National Bank and Essar Steel kept up the pace. They were followed today by Tata Motors, which announced a 50 per cent jump in its third-quarter earnings.

 In today?s trading, the sensex opened at 6463.52 and scaled an intra-day high of 6565.30 before ending at 6555.94, showing an increase of 136.85 points, or 2.13 per cent.

 The volume of business on BSE was Rs 2,680.16 crore, an increase from Rs 2,528.65 crore on Friday. Reliance Industries was the top traded share with a turnover of Rs 135.36 crore. It was followed by SAIL (Rs 113.95 crore), State Bank (Rs 104.35 crore) and ONGC (Rs 100.40 crore).

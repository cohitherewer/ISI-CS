 Inflation up at 5.64%

 New Delhi, April 29 (PTI): The rate of inflation shot up to a four-month high of 5.64 per cent during the week ended April 16, even as the finance and petroleum ministries struggled to find a way to hike fuel prices. 

 The point-to-point wholesale price index (WPI) inflation rose 0.16 per cent from 5.48 per cent in the previous week due to costlier food and manufactured products even as minerals became cheaper. The rate was 4.68 per cent a year ago. The index of primary articles rose 0.1 per cent to 187.1 points due to costlier food and non-food products. 

 The food articles? group index was up 0.3 per cent to 188.3 points due to higher prices of poultry chicken (8 per cent), fish and eggs (7 per cent each), maize, bajra and moong (2 per cent each), and arhar and urad (1 per cent each).

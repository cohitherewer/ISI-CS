 The company?s exports stood at Rs 243.54 crore, down 5.3 per cent in value terms. In an official communiqu?, Nestle has cited the shift in the composition of instant coffee exports to Russia from bulk to retail prices as the main reason for the drop in exports.

 ?Value for money? and ?affordability? will remain thrust areas for the company, stated the release.

 ?There has been a shift in consumer spending towards asset building and non-food related lifestyle changes, driven by low-cost credit available widely to consumers and diverting some consumer demand from FMCG products. Hence, we focused on maintaining market shares, improving the organisational structure, improving penetration into newer territories and controlling costs,? said Martial Rolland, chairman and managing director of Nestle (India).

 The company will continue to strengthen the marketing support to its brands like Maggi 2-Minute Noodles, Nestle Munch and Sunrise Instant Coffee, the release added.

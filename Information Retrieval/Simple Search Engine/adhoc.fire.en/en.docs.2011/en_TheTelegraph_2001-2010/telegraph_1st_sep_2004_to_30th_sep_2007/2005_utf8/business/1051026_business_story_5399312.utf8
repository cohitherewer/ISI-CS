 New Delhi, Oct. 25: Ford Motor, the second largest automobile company in the world, today rolled out mid-sized sedan Fiesta for the Indian market.

 The car will be available in two variants, one with a 1.6-litre petrol engine and the other with a 1.4-litre common rail diesel engine. Fiesta will compete with Honda?s City and Hyundai?s Accent.

 Although the US operations are sputtering, chairman Bill Ford said investing in growing markets is the way forward. ?India is right at the top of that list,? Ford said. ?This market (India) is critical to our plans for building a Ford Motor Co for the 21st century.?

 Ford said the US problems would not affect growth in India or any other developing automobile market. ?We have a cash reserve of $24 billion and we are a profitable company. There is no constraint in investing in our business in India.? 

 Emphasising that the company is on a growth path, he said, ?We do have issues with US operations and are addressing it. Soon you will see results.?

 Ford did not divulge the financial details of its India investment plan. ?There are no figures, which we can state. We are a family owned company and take a long view of things. We sure have figures but they are internal.?

 The company is planning to increase sourcing of components from India, which will help it rationalise cost and manpower in developed markets.

 Talking about the new car, Ford said Fiesta has been specifically designed to meet Indian conditions. For instance, Ford Motor has taken into consideration the monsoon floods in India while designing the car. Fiesta also promises superior air-conditioning, an important feature for the Indian market.

 ?Fiesta is truly a product of and for the Indian market,? he said. Engineers from India have been involved in designing and developing the car, he added. 

 Ford Motor is also planning to expand its R amp;D activity in India.

 According to officials, Fiesta is expected to boost Ford?s sales in India. Even after operating for more than a decade here, Ford?s share is still in single digit percentage.

 ?We expect Fiesta to do a lot in terms of sales. I hope it will increase our sales significantly in India,? Ford said.

 Ford India, which has its plant near Chennai, currently sells four models in India ? its flagship Ikon, sports-utility vehicle Endeavour, premium sedan Mondeo and the recently-launched Fusion.

 Ford?s sales for the first six months dropped 24.8 per cent to 9,314 units from 12,399 units in April-September 2004.

 Rejig recipe for power subsidies

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 In a new light 

 Calcutta, March 27: The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) will soon come out with guidelines to calculate cross-subsidy in a way that a seven-member committee of regulators has recommended.

 Sources said the regulator is expected to consider the ?avoided cost method? for the computations, given that it has already found favour with members of the committee.

 The committee has focused on the electricity act?s objective of promoting open access by forcing utilities to shore up efficiency levels. It felt that the cross-subsidy surcharge should have the least possible financial impact on firms even as it promotes competition among them.

 The first step in computing cross-subsidy under the avoided cost method is to ascertain the projected capacity likely to go out of hand once open access kicks in.

 Since the idea is to stay away from power purchases of small magnitudes, the variable charges ? transmission and wheeling for instance ? saved this way is the avoided cost. To the avoided cost will be added the fixed charge of power purchase and the variable costs incurred to arrive at the final supply figure.

 CERC officials say the difference between the average realisation from a category of consumers and the avoided cost will represent the cross-subsidy surcharge.

 The seven members of the panel are K.N. Sinha of CERC, R.D. Gupta of Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission, K. Sreerama Murthy and Surinder Pal of the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission, B. C. Jena of the Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission, A. K. Jain of Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission and Vivek Sharma of Teri.

 Cross-subsidy is one of the most controversial issues in the power sector of the country. The Electricity Act, 2003 envisages phasing them out. The industry, too, has made it clear that this must go for it to stay competitive. However, states are not willing to phase out the cross-subsidy abruptly and only want the burden to be lowered.

 Last month, CERC streamlined the procedure and pricing scheme for those seeking power under open access in the inter-state transmission system. Transmission access is an important mechanism for opening up the electricity sector.

 Meanwhile, India?s energy shortage has declined to 6.8 per cent in first nine months of 2004-05 from 7.1 per cent last year. Energy shortage has declined from 8.8 per cent in 2002-03 to 7.1 per cent in 2003-04 and 6.8 per cent in April-December 2004-05.

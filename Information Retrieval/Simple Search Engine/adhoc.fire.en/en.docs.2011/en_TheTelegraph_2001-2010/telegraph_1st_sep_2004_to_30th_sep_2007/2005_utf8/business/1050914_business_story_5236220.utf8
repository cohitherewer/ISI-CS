 Employers to hire 6% more in Q4

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: Indian employers are expected to take on 6 per cent more staff on their payrolls during the fourth quarter of the current financial year compared with the third quarter, according to a survey carried out by Manpower Inc of the US.

 The survey reveals a very ?buoyant hiring sentiment in India with an overall net employment outlook of 40 per cent, an increase of 6 percentage points from 34 per cent in the third quarter.?

 The survey derives the net employment outlook by taking the percentage of companies that expect total employment to increase, and subtracting from this the percentage anticipating a decrease in employment in the next quarter. 

 Out of the 3,835 employers interviewed, 43 per cent said they expect to hire more people during the fourth quarter, while 3 per cent see a reduction. Another 48 per cent expect to retain their manpower at the same level.

 The survey covers employers in seven industries ? finance, insurance, real estate, manufacturing, mining and construction, public administration and education; services, transport and utilities, wholesale and retail trade. 

 The survey forecasts hiring activity across all industry sectors with the greatest expectations reported by services, where 45 per cent companies expect an increase. 

 This is followed by finance, insurance, real estate public administration and education with 43 per cent. 

 Next on the list is mining and construction at 39 per cent, followed closely by manufacturing at 38 per cent; wholesale and retail trade sector with 33 per cent and transport and utilities with 32 per cent. 

 The survey further states that services, while maintaining its position as the most buoyant sector in India, has shown only a marginal quarter-on-quarter net employment outlook of 1 percentage point from 44 per cent to 45 per cent. 

 Employer expectations in finance, insurance and real estate have grown by a modest 2 percentage points.

 New seeds to be sown to reap rich farm harvest

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: The Union government has prepared a new formula to revive the ailing farm sector. The formula calls for stepping up investment in irrigation, opening up farm produce markets and focus on dryland farming, which would help states like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and parts of Maharashtra and Karnataka.

 The agenda, to be unveiled at a meeting of the full Planning Commission tomorrow, will, however, give short shift to an earlier plan prepared in mid-1990s that envisaged ushering in a second green revolution in the east and south. Such a change in stand may not go down well with the UPA government?s Left allies or with the RJD whose political base lies in these areas. 

 The new plan calls for completing major, medium and minor irrigation projects, adding some 12 million hectares of irrigated land, besides bringing another 8 million hectares of fresh farmland under irrigation. ?This total of 20 million hectares will include districts in the east and south,? a plan panel official said. But the thrust on a planned second green revolution with a package deal for the backward districts of Orissa, Bihar and Bengal, would be missing, he said.

 The Prime Minister?s Office wants this new plan to be the cornerstone of a sustained economic recovery, which will last his five-year tenure. Singh has exchanged several notes with his trusted lieutenant, plan panel deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, as well as agriculture minister Sharad Pawar on this. 

 The agenda for Tuesday?s meeting says the government needs to ensure competitiveness by removing constraints, sanitary and phytosanitary, bring in investment-friendly taxation policy which will encourage agro processing and export zones and food product industries. It also wants to bring in a country-wide insurance cover for farmers and overhaul the existing farm produce marketing laws. 

 The Centre wants to focus on a plan which will, in the long run, replace the system of state guarantee for purchase of foodgrain.

 Besides the huge costs the government currently incurs in buying foodgrain ? roughly Rs 9,000 crore in any given year ? the government also has to spend huge sums in storing these stocks.

 Instead it would like to reduce purchases of grain to far lower levels needed to maintain a food security and spend a fixed sum on guarantees for farm prices. 

 Sources said this could help the government save as much as Rs 4,000 crore annually.

 It also wants to overhaul the cooperative credit system so that a targeted Rs 105,000 crore credit reaches small and medium farmers. The Congress-led government has already announced it would increase credit flows to cash-strapped farmers.

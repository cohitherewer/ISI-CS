 Centurion open to buyouts

 Bhandari: On the prowl

 Mumbai, Dec. 24 (PTI): Centurion Bank of Punjab is looking at more acquisitions to increase its presence in the domestic market.

 To fund the acquisition and other expansion plans, the bank will raise up to Rs 416 crore in the overseas or domestic markets. 

 The bank has cleared a plan to increase its authorised capital to Rs 250 crore from Rs 150 crore by issuing additional 20 crore shares to three private equity investors ? GW Capital, Chrys Capital and Citigroup Venture Capital.

 GW Capital and Chrys Capital will hold a 4.73 per cent stake each, while Citigroup Venture Capital will own 3.99 per cent.

 Acquiring more banks is part of our strategy. We will grab the opportunity as and when it comes, said chief executive officer Shailendra Bhandari from Goa where the board had met for an extraordinary general meeting.

 Bhandari said the acquisition would aim at increasing the banks presence in the country and would be carried out in such a manner that the branches did not overlap.

 Centurion Bank of Punjab has 240 branches, mainly concentrated in the northern and the southern regions of the country. It has a reasonable presence in the west, but is hardly present in the east.

 Asked whether it would look at any bank in the east for the proposed acquisition, Bhandari avoided a direct answer. 

 We are open to acquisition in any part of India, but that has to be materialistic and synergetic, Bhandari said. By the end of this fiscal, the bank is planning to add 10 more branches to take its branch network to 250 locations.

 The bank will focus on the retail, small and medium enterprises, infrastructure and agriculture sectors, Vivek Vig, country head (retail), said.

 The EGM also cleared a proposal to raise up to Rs 416 crore through global depository receipts, American depository shares and foreign currency convertible bonds.

 Arrest me, Im available, says Anil

 Mumbai, Aug. 2 (PTI): Facing severe flak from several quarters over the delay in restoration of power in some areas, Reliance Energy Ltd chairman Anil Ambani today denied any negligence on the part of the company and said he was willing to court arrest if the authorities wanted that.

 Asked about reports that the government could arrest some Reliance Energy (REL) officials over the delay in restoration of power supply, Ambani said, Arrest me, I am available here.

 I am not getting into a blame game. Taking action under the law is a privilege of the government and authorities. Putting a group of 100 people behind bars would not give power to my 45,000 consumers, he said.

 There is no negligence, no lapse. Challenges may be underestimated by the system, Ambani said. 

 Regretting the inconvenience caused to consumers, he said the disaster was unpredictable, intensity was not understood and the complexity of trying to come back to normal was underestimated.

 REL is under criticism from the government and consumers in certain supply areas, which are sans power since a week after heavy downpour disrupted normal life. Ambani has announced a Rs 100-crore disaster management plan to cope with unprecedented natural calamities in future.

 Earlier, blaming REL for the delay in restoration of power in some areas of Mumbai, state revenue minister Narayan Rane said the government can take action and arrest Ambani. We can act against Anil and arrest him. We will not be doing it for fun, he said.

 Mumbai police commissioner A.N Roy said he was not happy with the efforts taken by REL to restore power in Mumbai. Although Anil had claimed that power was restored to nearly 99 per cent consumers, according to Roy, The efforts, which the company claimed to be making, are not visible.

 Calcutta, Feb. 16: Haier has lined up investments worth $15 million to consolidate its Indian operations during 2005.

 The $12.1-billion group had entered the consumer durables segment in January last year through a wholly-owned subsidiary. It made a foray in the mobile phone segment in the first week of February this year.

 ?We have launched seven models in India priced between Rs 3,654 and Rs 14,940. For the first twelve months of operations, we have set a target of 0.5 million phones. New products will be introduced as the demand grows,? Haier India president and CEO T. K. Banerjee said.

 The Chinese major also plans to launch its CDMA range in India by the year-end. ?We will initiate talks with CDMA operators ? Reliance and Tata Teleservices ? soon.? The company has a range of both SIM-based and operator-programmed handsets. It will also launch the push-to-talk models in the next three months. The company has tied up with Trust Telecom for exclusive distribution in India.

 Haier also plans to set up a manufacturing unit in the country at an investment of $5 million.

 ?We have received proposals from various states,? said Banerjee. ?We will decide by May this year.?

 Initially, the company plans to start manufacturing television sets.

 Haier India director Pranay Dhabhai said, ?At present, televisions are sourced from contract manufacturers like Whirlpool and Voltas. A decision regarding manufacturing units for refrigerators, airconditioners and mobiles will be taken depending on the growth in demand.?

 He said with a mere 15 per cent share of the country?s consumer durables sales, the eastern region is not a major destination for a manufacturing facility.

 The Haier group has manufacturing facilities in 13 countries across the world with a product range comprising 15,100 models in 96 categories.

 The company has set up a distribution network of 2500 dealers and 130 customer support centres. Dhabhai said Haier may also introduce its laptop range into India by the year-end or early 2006.

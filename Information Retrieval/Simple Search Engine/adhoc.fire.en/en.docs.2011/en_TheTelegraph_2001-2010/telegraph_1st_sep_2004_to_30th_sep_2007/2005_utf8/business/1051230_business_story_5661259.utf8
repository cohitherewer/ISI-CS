 New Delhi, Dec. 29: Differences on the prices of natural gas to be delivered through the proposed Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline came to the fore at today?s meeting of the India-Iran joint working group. 

 Petroleum secretary S.C. Tripathi admitted that there was a variation in the pricing of gas by the two countries.

 Iranian deputy petroleum minister M.H. Nejad Hosseinian said an Iran-India-Pakistan tripartite meeting will be held in February in Tehran at which the gas price formula would be taken up for further discussion. 

 Iran is benchmarking the price to current international rates which India cannot afford to pay.

 The power sector is the biggest consumer of natural gas and the price of electricity is regulated in the country. 

 The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) will be able to pay around $3 per million British thermal units (mBtu) for the gas, while the international rates are ruling at $10 per mBtu because of high oil prices.

 NTPC wants the price of natural gas to be benchmarked to coal as this is the alternative fuel and is also available in large quantities in the country. 

 The project structure for the pipeline and the need for an early framework agreement was also discussed at the meeting.

 India has said its financial consultants have suggested a number of possible options relating to project structure that will meet the country?s requirements for a safe and secure world-class project.

 Iran has reiterated its commitment to the earlier agreed scheme of sale and purchase of gas at the Indian border and has also agreed to study the options proposed by the Indian side.

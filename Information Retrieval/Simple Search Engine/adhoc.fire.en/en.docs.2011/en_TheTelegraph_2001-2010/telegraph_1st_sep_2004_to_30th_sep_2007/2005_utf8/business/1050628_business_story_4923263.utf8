 London, June 27 (Reuters): Oil prices hit a new record above $60 a barrel on Monday, driven by demand growth resilience in the face of high fuel costs and worries about oil policy under Irans new hardline president.

 US August crude traded as high as $60.64 a barrel and went up 55 cents at $60.39. US crude is above $60 for every month until August 2006 with December 2005 setting a peak $61.90 a barrel. 

 London Brent set a record $59.21 a barrel before easing to $58.91, up 55 cents.

 The market is testing higher to see what price levels this demand can endure, said Naohiro Niimura, vice-president at the derivative products division of Mizuho Corporate Bank.

 Prices have risen as investors bet refiners and producers will struggle to meet winter demand in the fourth quarter. 

 While high prices are eroding some strength from the world economy, the overall growth picture remains solid, central bankers meeting in Switzerland said at the weekend.

 There was a general consensus that we will have high oil prices for at least the next two or three years, said Martin Redrado, Argentinas central bank governor.

 That economic resilience has encouraged speculators to test consumers ability to absorb higher costs, with only a significant pull-back in demand from an economic slowdown seen likely to tame prices.

 Victory in Irans presidential election for ultra-conservative Mahmoud Ahmadinejad also helped support prices.

 Ahmadinejad has vowed to flush out corruption from the countrys oil sector and favour domestic investors, although analysts do not expect a big shift in production policy.

 We dont know in practice yet what Ahmadinejad means for foreign oil policy or Irans role in Opec but there could well be months of uncertainty which will further delay progress on production capacity, said Iranian consultant Mehdi Varzi.

 Held back by US sanctions, Iran has struggled to lift output capacity with foreign investment still severely restricted.

 I think Irans capacity is actually falling, said Varzi. It will take time but Ahmadeinejad may be able to streamline policy decisions which would encourage foreign investors.

 The president-elect said his nation would press ahead with its controversial nuclear programme, which the United States sees as part of an effort to build atomic weapons.

 That is likely to stir geopolitical worries on oil markets sensitive to the chance of output disruptions when spare capacity is limited to small unused volumes in Saudi Arabia.

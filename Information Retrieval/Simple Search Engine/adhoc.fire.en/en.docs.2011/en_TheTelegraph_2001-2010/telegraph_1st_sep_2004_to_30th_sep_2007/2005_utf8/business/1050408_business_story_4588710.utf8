 Furnace revamp to boost Tata Steel output

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 7: Tata Steel?s 1-million-tonne capacity expansion programme at its Jamshedpur steel works has received a major leg-up with the ?blowing in? of the upgraded ?G? blast furnace on April 6. 

 The upgraded furnace will have a capacity of 1.80 million tonnes per annum and a planned campaign life of 15 years.

 The upgradation has been done at a project cost of Rs 850 crore with the support of SMS-Demag of Germany. Not only has it provided quality hot metal at a lower fuel rate but will also help reduce cost of production. Besides, the hot metal capacity of the company will also go up to 5.2 million tonnes in 2005-06 compared with a production of 4.35 million tonnes in 2004-05.

 The ?G? blast furnace was shut down on December 3, 2004 for upgradation. Renowned blast furnace experts from Germany and Italy were present during the ?blowing in? operation. They will help Tata Steel reach the rated capacity of the furnace within the first thirty days of operations.

 The ?G? blast furnace, which is running smoothly since blowing, is the largest blast furnace of Tata Steel. It had an initial capacity of 1 million tonnes per annum and a planned campaign life of 10 years. The furnace was ?blown out? after producing 14 million tonnes of hot metal in its first campaign of 12 years.

 This is the highest ever production achieved by any blast furnace in its first campaign in India.

 Apart from the upgradation of the ?G? blast furnace, a new sinter plant is now under commissioning trials. A new rebar mill will be completed in the next few months.

 With the completion of this upgradation, Tata Steel will have a finished steel capacity of 7 million tonnes per annum, including the 2-million-tonne capacity of NatSteel Asia, which it recently acquired.

 The company has set a target of 15 million tonnes per annum capacity through organic growth and investments in the greenfield and brownfield expansion projects.

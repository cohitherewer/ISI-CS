 Centrino fuels Intel earnings

 Upwardly mobile 

 San Francisco, April 20 (Reuters): Intel Corp, the world?s largest chip maker, on Tuesday reported a 25 per cent rise in quarterly profit on strong demand for its Centrino notebook computer chips, sending shares up 3 per cent and allaying fears of an industry slowdown. 

 The results, which sent a wave of relief through Wall Street after last week?s bombshell earnings shortfall from International Business Machines Corp, came in at the top end of Intel?s forecast and above the average analyst estimates. 

 ?We still see pretty solid demand around the world,? Intel chief financial officer Andy Bryant said in an interview. ?I can?t yet say that I see the signs of weakness that IBM saw.?

 Intel also raised its forecast for annual gross profit margins and boosted its yearly budget for spending on chip factories by $500 million, lifting shares of suppliers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment. 

 ?Intel beat across the board,? said Steve Neimeth, portfolio manager at AIG SunAmerica Mutual Funds, who oversees funds owning about 200,000 Intel shares. 

 Net income in the first quarter ended April 2 rose to $2.15 billion, or 34 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $1.73 billion, or 26 cents a share. Sales rose to $9.43 billion from $8.09 billion, slightly below the all-time company record of $9.6 billion set in the fourth quarter of 2004. 

 The results from the Santa Clara, California-based company topped the average Wall Street expectation of a profit of 31 cents a share on sales of $9.31 billion.

 Sony to pay $7 m to outgoing bosses

 Tokyo, June 1 (Reuters): Struggling electronics maker Sony Corp will give chief executive Nobuyuki Idei and three other outgoing executives a retirement package worth a total of about $7 million.

 Idei is set to lose his job as chairman and CEO as part of a sweeping overhaul of management later this month. He will be replaced by Welsh-born Howard Stringer, now head of Sonys US unit, handing the reins to a non-Japanese for the first time. 

 In a report released on its Website late on Tuesday, Sony said it will pay an aggregrate 761 million yen ($7.02 million) to four bosses who are giving up the posts of corporate executive officers ? Idei, current president Kunitake Ando, Ken Kutaragi and Tsutomu Niimura.

 The combined payout to the four is less than half the 1.6 billion yen retirement package given to Norio Ohga, who served as president from 1982 to 1995. The unusually large payment to Ohga grabbed headlines and angered shareholders when it was announced in 2003.

 Sonys core electronics unit is expected to lose money for the third straight year in the 2005-06 business term, ending next March, hit by sliding prices of flat TVs, DVD recorders and other products.

 A Sony spokesman said the company had not changed its calculation method for executive retirement pay.

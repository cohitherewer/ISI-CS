 Currency comfort: Rupee rises to 45.05

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 26: As Dalal Street licked its wounds in a savage selloff, the inter-bank forex market provided some cheer to investors looking for solace outside equity.

 The rupee raced to 45.05 today, lifted by hopes that more foreign funds would flow in and dollars stashed in exporters accounts abroad will arrive. FIIs have pumped $457 million into shares between December 19 and 22.

 The rupee opened firm at 45.11 against the dollar and rallied to 45.05 in a handsome gain over its previous close. It made big gains even against pound, euro and yen. The currency closed at 78.14 against the pound compared with its previous finish of 78.45. Against the euro, the rupee opened at 53.41, but later ended at 53.46, up from 53.61 on Friday. The rupee was at 38.73 per 100 yen.

 Meanwhile, the RBI fixed the reference rate for the dollar at 45.12 against 45.16 on Friday. The rate for pound was 78.16 compared with 78.52. The rupee has come back a long way from early this month, when finance minister P. Chidambaram had to step in with reassurances that the decline in the rupee was the result of the dollars march against key currencies. 

 It is dollar-impacted change basically. We are watching the situation. I am in touch with the RBI governor Y.V. Reddy, Chidambaram had said, as the Indian unit teetered at 46.29 against the greenback.

 What also turned the tide in the rupees favour were reports a week back that the foreign funds had so far invested more than $10 billion in portfolio money during this calendar year. This set the tone for the currency consolidation over the past couple of days.

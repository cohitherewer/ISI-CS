 Coke uncorks Aamir again

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 17: A new season of summer campaigns is about to open for the cola majors. 

 Coca-Cola has said its summer campaign will feature Aamir Khan. A Coca-Cola spokesperson said, ?Aamir Khan will be back, but in a way he never went away, only that his ?thanda matlab Coca-Cola? ads were not being featured because the season is now.?

 Coca-Cola is already running an ad campaign featuring Aishwarya Rai. Soon the Aamir Khan ads will also be on air. 

 The company has come out with a new campaign for Limca, which has been repositioned. ?The focus is now on freshness. Earlier, it was more on thirst quencher,? the spokesperson said. 

 Khan has already appeared in over six TV campaigns for ?thanda matlab Coca Cola?. Carrying forward that concept, the new campaign is expected in the first week of April. 

 New campaigns for Sprite, Maaza and Georgia coffee are also on the offing. Products will be promoted in both mass media and in below the line advertising. Coca-Cola?s new Thums Up ad features actor Akshaya Kumar. 

 Arch rival Pepsi has recently launched a campaign for 7 Up, which features Yana Gupta and animated character Fido Dido. It is also carrying a Saif Ali Khan ?Khufia card? campaign for Brand Pepsi. New campaigns for Diet Pepsi and Mirinda are also on air and more campaigns for other brands from the Pepsi stable are on the offing. 

 The cola companies never disclose the budget for their ad campaigns.

 Cell firms to get USO fund share

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Maran: Looking ahead

 New Delhi, April 13: The government today said the Telegraph Act would be amended to make cellular service providers eligible for a share in the universal service obligation (USO) fund meant for connecting rural, highway, rail and telecom networks.

 ?We have discussed the matter with the USO fund administrator and are working out the details to incorporate cellular services in the ambit of the USO fund,? said telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran.

 The USO fund was created for providing fixed-line telephone services in rural areas and BSNL has been the main implementing agency. Since most of the private basic service providers had failed to meet the rural obligation, the government had created the fund to subsidise BSNL for the purpose.

 Entitling cellular operators to a share of the fund would mean that private cellular firms get a major financial assistance for their next phase of expansion either in villages or on the highways.

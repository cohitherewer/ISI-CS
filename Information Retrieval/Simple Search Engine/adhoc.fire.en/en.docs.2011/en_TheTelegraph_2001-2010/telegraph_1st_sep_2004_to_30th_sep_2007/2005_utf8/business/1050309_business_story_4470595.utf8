 Whiff of hope in Birla case

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Gurumurthy: Mediator?

 Calcutta, March 8: Both sides vehemently deny any peace initiative. But when S. Gurumurthy ? the celebrated mediator who brokered peace for many complicated corporate disputes ? is seen in the court room where one of the Birla-Lodha cases is being bitterly fought, the rapprochement theory is bound to get some attention.

 Officially Gurumurthy is only an adviser to the Birla family in its legal struggle against Lodha.

 When asked if there was a possibility of an out-of-court settlement, Gurumurthy said: ?There is a settlement only if there is a battle.? But he refused to elaborate.

 On whether he would advise a settlement here, Gurumurthy retorted: ?If I was on Lodha?s side, I would have told him to settle it.?

 ?The one who has all should make the first move,? he said.

 Gurumurthy has brokered peace in many corporate disputes like the Bajaj family spat. He was also involved in the battle between the L amp;T management and the AV Birla group over the control of L amp;T?s cement unit.

 Gurumurthy?s entry comes at a time when the Birla family and Lodha are embroiled in as many as seven cases.

 The legal battle broke out in July last year soon after the death of Priyamvada Birla. Lodha, a close confidant of M. P. Birla and his wife Priyamvada Birla, was found out to be the beneficiary of the latter?s will. 

 The Birla family put up a united front and challenged the will which bestowed the entire estate of Rs 5,000 crore on Lodha.

 Cases continue

 Calcutta High Court will hear tomorrow an application by two sisters of M. P. Birla ? Radha Devi Mohta and Lakshmi Devi Newar ? who filed a fresh petition today for the appointment of an officer to make inventory of the personal belongings of late Priyamvada Birla.

 Meanwhile, the criminal case continued in Calcutta High Court with senior advocate Ram Jethmalani contending that the criminal complaint against Lodha should not be quashed. 

 Jethmalani argued that Lodha had acted in complete breach of trust and responsibilities to ensure that the properties and assets vested in the three charities go to him. 

 Lodha totally disregarded his fiduciary relationship with Priyamvada Birla and, on the contrary, took advantage of this relationship to further his own interest by committing the fraud, Jethmalani told the Court. His submissions will continue tomorrow.

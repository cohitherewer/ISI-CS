 Bias babble in spectrum spat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hear me out

 New Delhi, Aug. 31: Mobile operators have unleashed a fusillade of letters to grab a larger share of the spectrum allocation from the government.

 The issue continues to haunt the department of telecommunications (DoT) with GSM operators like AirTel and Hutch pitted against their CDMA rivals such as Reliance Infocomm and Tata Indicom in the fight for the scarce resource.

 Spectrum, through which telephone calls and data travel, is limited and, therefore, the focus of an intense lobbying war within the industry.

 In a letter to the department recently, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has expressed concerns about the proposed relaxation in subscriber-linked allocation criteria, which they feel could help CDMA operators.

 We are deeply distressed and concerned to note that the spectrum committee appears to have disregarded several facts, COAI director-general T.V. Ramachandran said.

 This will give CDMA operators a capital expenditure and cost advantage over GSM firms. It would encourage CDMA operators to continue to use their spectrum inefficiently. It will also allow them to spare a separate carrier to offer third-generation (3G) services, facilitating their selective and preferential backdoor entry into the 3G arena, he added.

 Another issue highlighted by the association relates to the efficiency in the use of spectrum. It claims that CDMA operators with 5 mhz spectrum can serve 2.38 times the number of subscribers as GSM operators with 10 mhz spectrum.

 The key issue is the number of sites; CDMA operators must invest equally in infrastructure (cell sites) to get the capacity to service a higher number of subscribers.

 According to the apex body of GSM operators, the communications minister had recently cited the unwillingness of operators to invest in infrastructure as a reason for the inefficient use of spectrum. If they increase cell sites, the same spectrum can be used to carry more traffic, the minister had said.

 COAI claims that the committees recommendations submitted to theDoT gives CDMA operators 100 per cent advantage as it requires them to set up less than half the number of cell sites as GSM operators. GSM operators have to pay 4 per cent of their revenues as spectrum charges while CDMA operators shell out only 2 per cent.

 Citigroup offloads IVRCL stake

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 16: Citigroup Inc has reportedly sold its entire stake of 15.5 per cent in IVRCL Infrastructure and Projects for a windfall gain.

 Citigroup had picked up IVRCL shares at an average price of Rs 125 and is believed to have sold the shares at Rs 450 and Rs 455, market sources said.

 The foreign institutional investor (FII) would have reaped a profit not less than Rs 105 crore, they added.

 Citicorp and Chrys Capital together had a 37.01 per cent stake in the Hyderabad-based IVRCL after they were allotted preferential shares in April last year. The two FIIs later on made a joint offer to buy another 20 per cent stake in the company.

 However, CitiCorps stake declined to around 15 per cent after IVRCLs recent follow-up public offer of equity shares through which it raised over Rs 125 crore. Reportedly, Chrys Capital also has reduced its stake in the Indian company from 15 per cent stake to 7.50 per cent last month. 

 Companies like Gammon India, Hindustan Construction and others in the infrastructure and construction sectors have caught the fancy of FIIs ever since the sectors were given a boost in the Budget 2005-06.

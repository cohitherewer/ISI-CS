 Cash registers ring, exchequer on a roll

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Sept. 21: India Inc deserves a pat on its back for an astounding 55 per cent increase in corporate tax collections between April and September 15. The spurt is a sign of sizzling balance sheets.

 Its absolutely fantastic. We were targeting a 30-35 per cent growth in corporate tax collections but have netted 55 per cent, an official of the Central Board of Direct Taxes said.

 Collections at Rs 18,000 crore were substantially higher than Rs 11,600 crore in the same period of 2004-05. It also sets the pace for a big leap towards the full-year target of Rs 1,10,000 crore. Much of the mop-up typically occurs in the last quarter of a financial year.

 The bulk of the cash reaching the exchequer in the five-month span came as advance tax from limited and private limited companies anticipating bumper profits on the back of a good monsoon and the governments drive to trigger a core sector spending burst.

 Partnership firms reported sluggish profit growth and, hence, lower growth in tax payments. Analysts said this was because small businesses have not been able to reap the benefits of the countrys liberalisation and, in many ways, are struggling with competition from Chinese and Southeast Asian imports. 

 Personal income tax collections, too, were healthy at Rs 18,200 crore, an increase of 17 per cent over Rs 15,600 crore in April-September 2004. This years jump has taken place despite a re-alignment in tax slabs. 

 Direct tax collections were at Rs 36,250 crore, of which wealth tax accounted for Rs 50 crore. This represented a rise of 33 per cent over Rs 27,300 crore same time last year.

 The good show by limited and private limited companies also partly explains the sensex surge, though it is not a satisfactory or complete explanation. Sensex is a more complex matrix than taxes, officials said.

 Government agencies, including the tax department, are investigating the flows of funds into stocks, especially those of small-cap companies. They are also checking if money lent by banks for other purposes is making its way into the booming equity market.

 The rise has come despite oil companies inability to contribute much to the tax kitty this time, the officials said. The leash on prices of petro-goods for several months has pushed some of them into the red or caused a profit drop.

 Co-op banks left alone

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Bangalore, Sept. 17: Consolidation of urban cooperative banks (UCBs) in the country is not on the RBIs agenda, Reserve Bank of India governor Y. V. Reddy said today.

 RBI is not even encouraging UCBs in this respect, he told reporters here. Question of consolidation in urban co-operative banking system is entirely on the basis of an enabling mechanism. The very nature of co-operative is that essentially it is local. Consolidation is not on top of the agenda (of RBI) under any circumstances, he said.

 RBI is prepared to consider any proposal on merger and acquisition if the banks concerned came forward, and the countrys central bank would give its opinion, which would be based on the balance-sheet and protection of depositors. The final decision is still with the state government. So, if you are asking if we are trying to encourage (consolidation); (we are) not even trying to encourage. We are only enabling, he said.

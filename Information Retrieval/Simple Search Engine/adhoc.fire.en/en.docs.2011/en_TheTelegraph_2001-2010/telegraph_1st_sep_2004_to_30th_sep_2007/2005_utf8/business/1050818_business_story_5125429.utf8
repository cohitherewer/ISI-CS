 Seoul, Aug. 17 (Reuters): Canadas Nortel Networks Corp and LG Electronics have signed a deal to create a $295-million telecom equipment joint venture in South Korea, aiming to grab a bigger slice of fast-growing Asian markets.

 LGs strengths in mobile phones complement Nortels network infrastructure expertise and wide marketing reach, analysts said, while the venture could also be a springboard for the Canadian firm to expand into the rest of Asia, especially China.

 Nortel, the worlds third-largest telecom equipment provider, will pay $145 million for 50 per cent plus one share in the venture, with LG owning the rest, the two companies said in a statement. 

 LG-Nortel Co Ltd will combine LGs relatively low-margin telecom gear business, ranging from optical to wireless and next-generation network products, with Nortels distribution and service business in South Korea. 

 The joint venture gives Nortel exposure to Korea, and they can take advantage of Koreas proximity to China to expand there ? this would be key to Nortels China strategy, said J.J. Park, an analyst at JP Morgan Securities.

 The combined entity had aggregate revenue of 600 billion won ($530 million) in 2004, according to the joint statement.

 LG could be entitled to payments over two years if the venture met certain business goals, the statement added, although analysts have previously said the deal was likely to have a limited impact on LGs earnings given the sectors low margins.

 Nortel chief executive Bill Owens said LGs infrastructure products would boost Nortels offerings as it competes with key rivals like Cisco Systems Inc in selling wireless gear and communications equipment to large enterprises in Asia. That should grow the profit and gross margins of this business ? we are very optimistic that we will be able to do better than we had thought, going forward together, Owens said. 

 The venture, which would have 1,200-1,500 staff, is expected to start operations in October, LG Electronics chief executive Ssang-su Kim said. LG believes that if the newly formed joint venture does well, theres no reason not to do an initial public offer (IPO), but there are no details yet, Kim said. 

 LG hopes the joint venture would boost its presence in domestic and overseas markets for the code division multiple access (CDMA) wireless transmission standard, which competes with global system for mobile communications.

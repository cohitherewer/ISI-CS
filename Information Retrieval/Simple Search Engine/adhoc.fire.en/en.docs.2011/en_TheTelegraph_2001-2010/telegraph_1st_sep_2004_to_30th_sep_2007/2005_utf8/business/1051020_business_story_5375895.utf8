 Cash-strapped Indian Oil sends SOS

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Oct. 19: Indian Oil Corporation has sent an SOS to the petroleum ministry for speeding up its reimbursements from Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India Ltd and GAIL (India) on under-recoveries in LPG, kersoene, petrol and diesel for the third quarter of the current fiscal (October-December). 

 IOC has also urged the ministry that it should be allowed to make a pro-rata adjustment for these funds every month instead of making it wait till the end of the quarter as the company has been facing a severe liquidity crunch. 

 According to the burden sharing formula that the petroleum ministry has in mind, OIL and ONGC are expected to pay $20 per barrel of crude as reimbursement of their share of the burden on the under-recoveries of petroleum products. 

 ONGC and OIL are expected to contribute around Rs 13,000 to 14,000 crore which accounts for about one-third of the total burden on the oil marketing companies due to under-recoveries on the sale of petroleum products during the year. However, IOC wants this money to come in as a continuous stream rather than an adjustment at the end of the period.

 The downstream oil corporation wants the ministry to initiate quick action in the matter as the cash drain on it has increased with the skyrocketing of global crude prices. 

 IOC desperately needs some respite otherwise it will be forced to borrow money at high-cost to meet its working capital requirement. 

 Since the issue of government bonds to the oil companies has been delayed, there is no immediate relief that they could have got by encashing these bonds. 

 IOC has for the first time ever suffered a loss during the first quarter of this fiscal and is keen to post a profit by the end of this fiscal. It is vital for the company to cut interest costs at this juncture.

 IOC chairman S. Behuria has stated that the companys under-recoveries on account of LPG and kerosene have gone up to Rs 5,000 crore between April and October this year, while those on petrol and diesel work out to around Rs 3,500 crore. 

 The government had hiked the price of petrol by Rs 3 per litre and made diesel dearer by Rs 2 per litre on September 6 last. 

 The petroleum minister had then stated that only 13 per cent of the increase in international prices had been passed on to the consumers. 

 The increases in petrol and diesel prices are expected to enable the oil marketing companies to get an additional revenue of Rs 5,000 crore on their sales during the rest of 2005-06. 

 The oil companies, however, will continue to bear 52 per cent of the burden though the government will now shoulder 33 per cent of it by way of subsidy on LPG and kerosene.

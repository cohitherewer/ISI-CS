 Oracle model to make e-governance a success

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 New wave 

 Calcutta, May 7: Oracle India has set up a model to successfully implement e-governance projects. Drawing from its experience in various states, the company has created a model that will replicate its experiences of various e-governance projects.

 ?We are now moving to the second tier of enabling inter-department and a government-to-citizen (G2C) interface,? said S. P. S. Grover, senior director, Oracle India. ?Learning from our capacity-building exercises in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, we are creating a model that will incorporate different aspects of governance along with the technical expertise available.?

 Oracle plans to create a force of e-managers, who will have the working knowledge of government departments as well as the technological knowhow. The idea is to create a single repository of information that can be accessed by all users and hence minimise search time and costs.

 The model developed by Oracle identifies areas to be addressed based on the interaction and feedback from officials of different departments. The company then identifies experts with working knowledge of the departments. This is then integrated with the technical knowhow of Oracle to build a programme.

 Oracle is also in the process of replicating its success in implementing an Integrated Financial Management System ? which takes care of all functions related to financial transactions among different state departments ? in Assam and will bring together people from the government and academia.

 Oracle has also enrolled 700 schools across the country for its Think.com initiative and is focusing on Oracle Academy that helps students learn the fundamentals of database and Java technology.

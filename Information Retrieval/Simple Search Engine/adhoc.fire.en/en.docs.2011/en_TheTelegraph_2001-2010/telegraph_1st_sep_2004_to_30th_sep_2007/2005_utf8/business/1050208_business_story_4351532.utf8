 ModiLuft buys return ticket

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: Royal Airways, a reincarnation of failed airline ModiLuft, is coming back under a new brand name SpiceJet, which will be a low fare rival to the Hyderabad-based Air Deccan.

 Royal plans to launch SpiceJet in May to try cash in on a percieved boom in cheap air travel in the country. The airline said it had signed an agreement to lease a first set of three Boeing 737-800s. 

 Royal Airline, which was once owned by the Modi group, is now run by an NRI consortium. The new owners were locked in a fight with the Modis for the control of the airline for several years. The tussle delayed the relaunch of the airline and changed its focus from a full-service carrier to that of a fare warrior.

 The airline is expected to be now locked in a new three-way contest for cheap, no-frills service between Air Deccan and another planned airline Go Air, soon to be launched by the Mumbai-based Wadia group. 

 UB promoted Kingfisher Airlines, which also got its licence along with the other three, is expected to launch a full service but low-fare airline and buy its own aircraft.

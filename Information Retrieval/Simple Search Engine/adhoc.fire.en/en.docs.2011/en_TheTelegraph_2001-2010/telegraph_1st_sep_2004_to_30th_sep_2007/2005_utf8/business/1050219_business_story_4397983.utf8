 S amp;P sees debt shadow on sovereign rating 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 18: India?s sovereign credit rating may be smudged by the failure of two state-run companies to keep their promises to creditors.

 Global rating agency Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P), which is examining the circumstances leading to missed interest payments by Instrumentation Ltd and HMT, said a delay in fulfilling their obligations may have implications on sovereign ratings.

 ?The missed payments on the bond issues, which are reportedly guaranteed by the Indian government (BB+/Stable/B), have become the direct obligation of the Centre. Therefore, the progress in fulfilling these obligations has potential implications for the sovereign rating,? S amp;P said. 

 S amp;P added that government-guaranteed debt has consistently been around 10 per cent of GDP, highlighting the Centre?s propensity to extend guarantees to public sector entities, which translate into a sizeable contingent liability. 

 The country?s sovereign ratings are constrained by the government?s high debt of 81.2 per cent of GDP in 2004, coupled with extensive contingent liabilities. The government owns a large stable of industrial enterprises and banks. 

 ?Although Standard amp; Poor?s has always taken note of the government support to its rating of individual companies, it does not automatically equate those with the sovereign grade due to the varying degree and reliability of support that has been evident over time,? the global rating agency added. 

 This statement by S amp;P comes after it raised Indias long-term foreign currency rating to a notch below the investment grade at BB+. The upgrade, according to S amp;P, reflected the countrys improved external position and growth prospects.

 Apart from raising the foreign currency rating, S amp;P also affirmed the countrys BB+ long-term local currency, and short-term ratings. The outlook is stable. 

 However, it reiterated that the principal risks to India are generated by a weak fiscal profile, particularly its high deficit and debt, and serious fiscal inflexibility, which is one of the worst among rated sovereigns.

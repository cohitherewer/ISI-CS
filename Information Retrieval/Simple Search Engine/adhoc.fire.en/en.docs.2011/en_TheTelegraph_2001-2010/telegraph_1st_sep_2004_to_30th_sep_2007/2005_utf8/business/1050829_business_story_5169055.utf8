 All set for the season

 New Delhi, Aug. 28: Hotels are sprucing up and expanding facilities in anticipation of a demand surge in the hospitality business with over 4 million overseas tourists expected to come this calendar year.

 Major five star hoteliers and some mid-market players have drawn up plans to invest Rs 10,000 crore over the next five years to fund their expansion programmes.

 The biggest investment will be made by Calcutta-based ITC Ltd. It is learnt that the tobacco company has budgeted approximately Rs 3,000 crore to expand its hotel division. According to officials, ITC will invest this on building two five-star deluxe hotels in Bangalore and Chennai. In addition, there are plans for building ?Villas? at ITC Golf Resort in Gurgaon (near Delhi). Also, a portion will be invested in overseas operations.

 The Taj, Oberoi, Leela and the Bharat group of hotels are earmarking an investment of Rs 1,000 crore each over the next couple of years. 

 ?The Oberoi group is planning to expand to Thailand, Cambodia and the UAE (Dubai) through management contracts. We also plan to build a 440-room hotel in Bandra-Kurla in Mumbai,? said P.R.S. Oberoi, chairman, Oberoi Hotels who had announced the investment plans at the group?s recent annual general meeting. 

 He added that a management contract has already been entered into for a 175-room property that will be built in Gurgaon shortly. 

 During the current fiscal, Indian Hotels Co Ltd (IHCL) has earmarked a capital expenditure of Rs 565 crore, said Ratan Tata, chairman, at the annual general meeting held earlier this month. Of this, Rs 500 crore will be spent for expansion, while the balance would be used to upgrade the existing properties.

 The company plans to add about 1,100 rooms (including 500 for the IndiOne Hotels) this financial year. IHCL?s immediate expansion would include Bangalore, Coimbatore and Mumbai. It will also roll out its Jiva brand of spas and equip each of its major hotels with a spa.

 IHCL is also looking at acquiring a suitable property in the Andamans, as well as an opportunity to set up a new hotel in Delhi in view of the upcoming 2010 Commonwealth games. 

 Choice Hotels, the hospitality company present in three and four-star categories, plans to spend Rs 150 crore over the next couple of years to build its four-star deluxe Clarion hotels in Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore, said Sandeep Gupta, executive director, Choice Hotels India.

 Among the new entrants, the Accor-InterGlobe joint venture, which is targeting the three-star hotel segment, plans to invest more than Rs 500 crore over the next five years, said Uttam Dave, president and CEO, InterGlobe Hotels Pvt Ltd. The joint venture is looking at setting up six Ibis brand of hotels in the first two phases of operation.

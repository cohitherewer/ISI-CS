 Steel companies ready to deliver price punch

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 31: Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) will increase prices by 5-10 per cent from tomorrow, a move that is expected to be followed by smaller companies like Ispat, Essar and Jindal Steel.

 A Tata Steel spokesperson said prices are likely to be increased for long-term and annual contracts by approximately 20 per cent. ?These are negotiated prices. In any case, talks with various customers are still on,? he said.

 The official declined to quantify the exact increase in rupees per tonne, saying this would vary across grades of steel.

 However, there are indications from market sources that SAIL is planning an increase of up to Rs 2,500 per tonne in the flat product category and Rs 800 in long products.

 ?We are increasing the prices and these would be announced tomorrow,? is all that SAIL chief V. S. Jain would say.

 Tata Steel cited two main reasons for the increase. ?We had reduced the prices by up to Rs 2,000 per tonne in August last year to help rein in raging inflation. This time, we have to pass on the rise in input costs,? the spokesman said. He, however, said the company raises prices when the long-term contracts with buyers come up for renewal. 

 Ispat, market sources said, was also considering an increase, which, sources say, could range from 3 to 5 per cent. Essar officials, too, confirmed the hike from April 1 but declined to offer details of the new set of prices.

 The Indian Steel Alliance, an association of all the big producers, argues that the cost of coke has gone up 300 per cent, iron pellets 200 per cent and sea freight by another 300 per cent.

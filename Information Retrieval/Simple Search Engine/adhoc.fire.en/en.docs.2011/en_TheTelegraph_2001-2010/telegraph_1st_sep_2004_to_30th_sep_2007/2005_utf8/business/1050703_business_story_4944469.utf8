 CNOOC defends Unocal bid

 Beijing, July 2 (Reuters): Chinas CNOOC Ltd. said on Saturday its request to the US government to review its plan to merge with oil and gas producer Unocal Corp was voluntary and aimed at clearing up doubts about the deal. 

 CNOOC has asked the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States (CFIUS) to review its $18.5-billion bid, which topped a $16 billion-plus cash and stock offer from Chevron Corp.

 Its a voluntary notice from CNOOC Ltd. We hope the review will be put onto formal proceedings of CFIUS as soon as possible as we are sure that the transaction is pure commercial, Chinas official Xinhua news agency quoted a CNOOC spokesman as saying. 

 CNOOCs bid for Unocal, whose headquarters in El Segundo, California, has become a complicating factor in the diplomatic jostling between China and the United States over currency and trade issues. 

 It also comes at a sensitive time when oil is trading near record highs, and both countries are intent on securing energy resources.

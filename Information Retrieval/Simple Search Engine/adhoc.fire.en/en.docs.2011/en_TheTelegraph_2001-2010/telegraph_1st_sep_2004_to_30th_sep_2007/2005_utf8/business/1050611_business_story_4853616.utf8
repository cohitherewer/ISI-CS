 Bangalore, June 10: The biotechnology industry has garnered more than $1 billion as revenues in 2004-05 because of a spurt in exports and vaccine sales.

 The industry has set a target of $5 billion by 2010, with a projected growth of 30 per cent this fiscal (2005-06). 

 In 2004-05, the revenues increased to $1.07 billion (Rs 4,745 crore), up 36 per cent from the previous year?s Rs 3,475 crore ($788 million). The top twenty companies recorded sales of Rs 2,478 crore in 2004-05, while six companies garnered revenues in excess of Rs 100 crore.

 Of a global biotech market of $91 billion, Indias share stands at 1.1 per cent.

 Releasing a report on the industry?s performance, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, president of the Association of Biotechnology-Led Enterprises (ABLE) and chairperson of Biocon Ltd, said, ?The domestic biotechnology sector is rapidly gaining global visibility. It has emerged as a billion-dollar business, thanks to the entrepreneurship of a group, which has braved many a hurdle and poor financial support.? 

 ?The national biotechnology strategy document that is under preparation promises extensive support to this emerging sector, which has set a revenue target of $5 billion by 2010,? she added.

 Mazumdar-Shaw said, ?Reaching the $2-billion mark will be easier as India is one of the largest producers of vaccines and will emerge as an important producer of protein therapeutics.?

 With domestic sales picking up rapidly in 2004-05, the market share of biotech exports declined to 42 per cent (Rs 2001 crore) from 55.65 per cent in 2003-04. Bio-pharma companies accounted for 75 per cent of the total sales in the sector.

 The survey ranked the top 20 home-grown biotech firms.

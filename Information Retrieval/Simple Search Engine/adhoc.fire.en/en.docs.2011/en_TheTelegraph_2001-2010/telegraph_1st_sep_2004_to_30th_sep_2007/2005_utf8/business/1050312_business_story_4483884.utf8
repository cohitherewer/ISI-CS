The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Gates, Buffett and ... Mittal

 AMIT ROY

 London, March 11: Forbes? ?rich list of America? today named Lakshmi Mittal, the Indian steel tycoon, as the world?s third richest man, whose wealth ($25 billion) is exceeded only by Americans Bill Gates of Microsoft and investment genius Warren Buffett, whose fortunes are worth $46.5 billion and $44 billion, respectively.

 Mittal, 55, who is the chairman of Mittal Steel Company, declined to comment on this feat. Forbes said Mittal?s rise was the fastest on the list. His fortune rocketed $18.8 billion over the past year to its current level of $25 billion.

 Gates remains the richest man in the world, though his net worth has declined slightly. The magazine said the US has the biggest number of new entrants this year with 69 new faces, followed by Russia with nine, the UK with eight and Germany with seven. 

 This year 47 countries are represented on the billionaires? list, with new entries from Kazakhstan, Poland, Ukraine and Iceland. In the case of cities, New York has the highest number of billionaire residents (34), followed by Moscow and San Francisco (20 each); then London and Los Angeles (18 each).

 Mittal, who lives in London ? he will soon move into the world?s most expensive private residence ? has been helped by the ever-increasing global demand for steel, not least from China, where his company has deep involvement in the republic?s burgeoning growth. 

 Mittal never stopped growing. He says he won?t rest until the group?s capacity has been boosted so that it becomes the first truly global steel company with an annual production of 100 million tonnes. It?s now 62 million tonnes.

 However, it remains to be seen how much opposition Mittal faces in implementing his job-cut plan. He has told analysts he wants to cut about 45,000 jobs worldwide over the next five years, reducing his 1,55,000-strong workforce to 1,10,000 by 2010.

 It is not known where the axe will fall but today a spokesman for Mittal told The Telegraph in London: ?The comment (about cuts) was based on the steel industry norm for average production per person. It was not focussed on any particular market or any particular region.?

 When Mittal first moved to London from Indonesia a decade ago, he spoke little about strengthening his links with India, although he did ensure his son, Aditya, 28, had his marriage ceremony in Calcutta, where the family originally had their base.

 ?India? Never!? mimicked one of Mittal?s rivals, in an apparent reference to his attitude to India 10 years ago. 

 In a recent keynote address in India, Mittal made amends and spoke in emotional terms about his native land.

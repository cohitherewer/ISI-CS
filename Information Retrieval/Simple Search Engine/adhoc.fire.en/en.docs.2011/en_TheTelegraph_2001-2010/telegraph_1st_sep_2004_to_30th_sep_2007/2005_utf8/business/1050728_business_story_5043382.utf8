 Canon profit zooms again

 PICTURE THIS

 Tokyo, July 27 (Reuters): Canon Inc said on Wednesday its net profit has risen for a 12th straight quarter on strong sales of digital cameras and office equipment, while rival Seiko Epson Corp posted a loss on sliding prices of small displays and cut its full-year forecast by 19 per cent.

 Canon stuck to its outlook for group net profit to rise 7 per cent to 367 billion yen ($3.26 billion) in calendar 2005, which would be a sixth straight year of record earnings, reflecting strong unit sales of office copiers, high-end digital cameras and laser printer engines supplied to Hewlett-Packard Co.

 But in a move that could worry some investors, the worlds largest maker of digital cameras and copiers logged a profit for the April-June quarter that was below analysts expectations and cut its 2005 operating profit target by 1 per cent due to falling product prices.

 Pricing pressure has also cut into profit margins at US-based office equipment maker Xerox Corp, which disappointed investors earlier this week with a weak quarterly result due to a shift in sales to lower-priced printers.

 Downward pressure on prices has been a bit sharper than we originally expected, Canon senior managing director Toshizo Tanaka told a news conference. 

 We have seen the biggest impact on office copiers and printers and compact cameras, Tanaka added

 The downward revision came despite a recent weakening of the yen, a boon for an exporter like Canon that gets most of its sales outside Japan.

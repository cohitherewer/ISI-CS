 Second quarter growth dips

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Dec. 31: Second-quarter growth slowed to 6.6 per cent against 7.4 per cent in the three months to June. The drop in pace was blamed on a decline of 0.8 per cent in farm output compared with an increase of 3.4 per cent in the first quarter of the current financial year.

 According to quarterly estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) released by the government today, the slowdown in agriculture overshadowed the 9.3 per cent increase in manufacturing ? up from 8 per cent in the first quarter.

 The growth tally in the first six months (April-September) of 2004-05 was 7 per cent, a touch higher than 6.9 per cent in the same period of the previous fiscal.

 The loss of growth steam on farms was also seen in mining, financial services, real estate and insurance. Mining grew at 4.8 per cent in the second quarter compared with 6.1 per cent in the first; financial, real estate and insurance totted up a combined tally of 5.9 per cent compared with 7 per cent in the April-June period.

 Construction, an industry with strong backward linkages, logged a growth rate of 5.2 per cent in July-September against 3.6 per cent in the first quarter of this year and 6.4 per cent in second quarter of 2003-04. 

 In absolute terms, GDP at factor cost (1993-94 prices) was Rs 3,47,308 crore against Rs 3,52,119 crore in the first quarter. In the first half, the figure was Rs 6,99,427 crore, up from Rs 6,53,699 crore in the same period last year.

 Community and social services sector, which grew at 15.4 per cent in the second quarter of the last financial year, slowed to 4.6 per cent in July-September this fiscal.

 Deficit shrinks

 The Centre?s fiscal deficit fell over 24 per cent to Rs 70,717 crore in the first eight months of this fiscal over the same time last year, mainly due to expenditure control.

 However, revenue deficit spiralled to Rs 73,948 crore in April-November. This was 97.1 per cent of the budgeted Rs 76,171 crore for all of 2004-05, figures released by the controller general of accounts today showed. The fiscal deficit of Rs 70,717 crore till November was around 51.5 per cent of the budgeted Rs 1,37,407 crore.

 Lawyers continue offensive

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 23: Purnendu Chatterjee today filed a fresh plea before the company law board (CLB) asking for a review of its September 5 order on Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) on the ground that facts on the share transfer to Indian Oil were suppressed at the hearing.

 Arguing this was tantamount to fraud, lawyers for the NRI entrepreneur said HPL shares were allotted on August 2, a day before IOCs cheque was encashed. This, they said, was enough to make the settlement invalid. 

 The Bengal government insisted there was nothing wrong if the shares were issued before the processing of the cheque. They cited a Supreme Court verdict that makes cheque encashment effective from the day it is issued. In IOCs case, it was done long back, in February.

 Early this month, the CLB upheld the allotment to IOC, but maintained a status quo on the rest of HPL shares till the final hearing slated for September 26 and 27.

 The Chatterjee Group has accused the Bengal government of secretly and surreptitiously allotting the shares to IOC in violation of a 1994 pact that gives Purnendu the right of first refusal on the shares of Haldia Petrochem.

 The Bengal government told the company board the shares went to IOC in line with a decision taken on November 2, 2004 at an HPL board meeting attended by TCG. 

 The move was also cleared at HPLs extraordinary general meeting on January 14. There is no question of it being a secret allotment, the Bengal government said.

 Automobile majors seek merger of multiple levies

 Line of reason

 New Delhi, Jan. 30: With less than a month to go for the Union budget, the Indian automobile industry is asking the finance ministry to do away with the multiple levies that are slapped on it.

 The Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA), the premium association of component makers in the country, has also voiced its demand for the reduction of customs duty on raw materials. 

 Speaking to The Telegraph, an official spokesperson of SIAM (Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers) said, ?Most automobile manufacturers face a practical problem owing to multiple levies. The procedural complications of these levies is a big issue.? 

 As of now, the automobile makers have to pay basic excise duty, special excise duty, automobile cess, National Calamity Contingent duty (NCCD) and the mandatory education cess of 2 per cent on all sectors. ?SIAM is asking for the multiple levies to be merged into a single rate,? the spokesperson said. 

 SIAM is the industry association that represents all automobile companies operating in the country. 

 It is also demanding a reduction in excise duties. For passenger cars and multiple-utility vehicles (MUVs), SIAM has asked for a proposed excise duty of 16 per cent against the present basic excise duty of 16 per cent. It has also asked for the removal of the 1 per cent NCCD on the ground that since it is meant for one year, it should not be continued. 

 In its pre-budget memorandum, ACMA has sought reduction of customs duty on basic raw materials like alloy steels, copper, aluminium, plastics and rubber to a level of 5 per cent. 

 It has also sought zero duty on aluminium scrap. President Deep Kapuria said, ?Since aluminium scrap is not a manufactured article, there is no justification of a 15 per cent duty on it.?

 The other demand of the industry pertains to the customs duty. According to the World Trade Organisation, the bound rate for imports is 40 per cent. SIAM is pressing for an increase in the customs duty on commercial vehicles to at least the bound rate of 40 per cent from 20 per cent. 

 The association has also proposed that the concessional duty of 16 per cent on commercial vehicles be extended to those MUVs that are registered as taxis.

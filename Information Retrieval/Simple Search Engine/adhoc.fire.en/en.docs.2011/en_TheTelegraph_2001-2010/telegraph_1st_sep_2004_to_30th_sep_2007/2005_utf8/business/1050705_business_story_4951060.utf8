 Andhra waits for official word

 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, July 4: The Andhra Pradesh government has reacted with dismay to reports that the Volkswagen project in the state has been put on ice because of a bribery scam that has rocked the German carmaker. 

 Helmut Schuster had visited Andhra Pradesh in the first week of June and inspected the site near Visakhapatnam. 

 Schuster had toured Visakhapatnam for two days and later called on chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy in Hyderabad. 

 Last May, industry minister Botcha Satyanarayana had led a delegation of officials from Andhra Pradesh for talks at Wolfsburg where the nitty-gritty of the project had been ironed out. 

 The state had been hoping to sign a formal agreement on the project soon after the VW board met on June 20. 

 Satyanarayana was travelling overseas and was unavailable for comment on the latest development but his office confirmed that they had heard about Schusters resignation. 

 Officials said they had received positive feedback after the VW board meeting in June. We are still awaiting a decision by Volkswagen on the Visakhapatnam site for their India operations, said a spokesman of the state industry department. 

 I have no information of a bribe charge against any Volkswagen official, said Raghavendra Rao, special officer in the industry ministers office, today. 

 Schuster, who was in charge of India operations, has been replaced by Bernhard Wolfgang, he said. 

 The car project was proposed to be set up on a 350-acre site at Aganampudi near Visakhapatnam as a full-fledged manufacturing plant. Earlier plans for completely knocked down (CKD) and semi-knocked down (SKD) operational routes had been abandoned. 

 The industry ministers office said the state government was ready to provide any kind of support to Volkswagen to set up its unit in the state. 

 There has been a change in plans now. Instead of CKD or SKD, Volkswagen planned to set up a full-fledged manufacturing plant. Hence, they were serious about promotion of an ancillary industry in Visakhapatnam and nearby areas, said Raghavendra Rao. 

 The Andhra government had taken out all stops to woo the German giant which had flirted with the idea of locating the plant at Aurangabad in neighbouring Maharashtra where wholly-owned subsidiary Skoda has its manufacturing plant. 

 The AP government has already released Rs 11 crore to Volkswagen to plan visits to India. 

 The state had also offered 350 acres free of cost for the venture.

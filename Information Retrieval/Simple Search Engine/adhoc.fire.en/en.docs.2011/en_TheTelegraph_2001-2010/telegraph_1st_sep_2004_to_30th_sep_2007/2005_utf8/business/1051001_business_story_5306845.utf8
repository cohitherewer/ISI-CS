 Purnendu seeks date with Buddha

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 30: Purnendu Chatterjee wants to meet Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and settle the dispute over the sale of Haldia Petrochemicals shares to Indian Oil Corporation. 

 We have placed a request for a meeting with the chief minister and are awaiting a date, Chatterjee, who was in the capital to attend the HPL board meeting, told The Telegraph, 

 He said the meeting was a routine one, held to review the performance of the company and its future prospects.

 Chatterjee said the meeting was held in a harmonious atmosphere. Government directors and representatives of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation were present at the event. 

 However, noone from Indian Oil attended. A senior IOC official said although the company has been allotted an 8.5 per cent share in HPL, its nomination to the board has not come through as yet. As a result, IOC was not represented at the meeting, he added.

 Chatterjee said the annual general meeting of HPL will take place next month but hardly any business will be transacted as part of an agreement between WBIDC and The Chatterjee Group at the company law board hearing earlier this week. 

 Purnendus request for the meeting with Bhattacharjee also comes in response to CLB chairman S. Balasubranians suggestion that TCG and WBIDC should meet the chief minister and try to resolve the dispute amicably. 

 Balasubramanian had said that the bitter wrangling would only harm HPL. And it was in the interest of the company to reach a compromise. 

 CLB has given a months time for settlement and the next hearings are on October 26, 27 and 28.

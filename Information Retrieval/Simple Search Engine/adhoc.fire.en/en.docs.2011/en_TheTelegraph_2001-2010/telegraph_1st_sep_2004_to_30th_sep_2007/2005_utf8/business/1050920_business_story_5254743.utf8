The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Who?s gaining? Surely not the retail investor

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 19: As the sensex soars into the stratosphere, there?s one question that everyone seems to be asking friends and colleagues: Did you make money in this bull run? 

 There have been three major stock market booms in the past decade-and-a-half: the one in 1992, the next in 2000 and the one this year. To be sure there have been a few boomlets in between, but there?s been nothing as consistent, powerful and inexorable as these three.

 If your answer to the question is an embarrassing no, don?t chide yourself for losing out on an opportunity that comes just once or twice in a decade. The truth is that you aren?t alone.

 Ever since the 2000-boom ran into the ground after the Ketan Parekh scam, retail investors have been loathe to shovel their surplus cash into the market, preferring instead to park it with banks as deposits, buy more insurance, salt away a part of the moolah in pension and retirement funds or just hold it in cash (See chart). 

 The sensex has topped 8400 and the year has been one of the best ever bull runs in the stock markets, but household savings in equity and debentures resolutely remain at a lowly 1 per cent of the total kitty. And analysts don?t see that number growing anytime too soon.

 Household savings

 The annual report released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for 2004-05 reveals that household savings are parked in two asset classes. The first is financial assets that include bank deposits, shares, small savings and insurance schemes. The other category is physical assets and prominent investments in this sector include real estate (housing) and gold.

 Observers here said since 2000-01, there has been a churn in terms of assets held by the household sector in favour of physical assets relative to financial assets. A major reason for this change is the interest in real estate. With banks offering cheap housing finance, many households have started buying new homes.

 Gold glitters

 Gold continues to be highly popular ? even though returns on the yellow metal is one of the lowest among all asset classes. Recent statistics released by the World Gold Council (WGC) show that India?s gold consumption jumped a massive 47 per cent during the second quarter of this calendar year compared with the same period last year as robust economic growth led to huge purchases by jewellers and investors.

 India?s 277-tonne demand during the period accounted for nearly 30 per cent of the total global gold demand, making it the world?s largest buyer. An interesting highlight is that this demand has been the highest for any quarter since the government liberalised gold import rules in 1998.

 Investment tool

 Significantly, the yellow metal is now gaining traction as an investment instrument. This is evident from the WGC figures, which show that purchases from Indian jewellers gained 42 per cent during the period, while those from investors soared 79 per cent.

 Analysts here reckon that while the reason for buying gold as an investment now accounts for roughly 15 per cent of its demand, this will rise to 20 per cent over the next few years. At present, jewellery accounts for a bulk of the gold demand.

 Speaking to The Telegraph, Sanjeev Agarwal, managing director, Indian sub-continent, WGC, said gold is now seen as an alternative asset class in India.

 Shift in focus

 The reasons for this key change is that while real estate prices in the country have been high, deposit rates have been lower, which has made investment in gold more attractive. Further, many investors are also using the profits from the rising stock markets to buy gold.

 While the appetite for gold is huge in both urban and rural areas, the latter have still not taken to stock markets and this could partly explain the low participation of shares and debentures in total household savings, said Parag Parekh of Parag Parekh Financial Services, a leading advisory in financial planning.

 However, Veer Sardesai, a certified financial planner based in Pune explains that many of the households even in urban areas are still not looking at equity markets from the investment point of view. 

 ?Though it is changing slowly, only a few are venturing into the markets,? he said.

 Lack of experience

 Sardesai said the principal reason for the low interest was that the Indian investor had not had a great experience with equity markets and that there had not been a sustained bull run. The past two bull runs highlighted by the presence of Harshad Mehta and Ketan Parekh were abruptly halted and this led to many investors burning their fingers.

 A senior official associated with a leading private sector bank here said in such circumstances, investors have taken to buying houses, apart from investing in risk-free instruments that include bank deposits, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) bonds, post office saving schemes and insurance.

 ?If you look at bank deposits, they have grown at an annual rate of 15 per cent, which is higher compared to mutual funds. Mind you, this 15 per cent growth is on a higher base,? he added.

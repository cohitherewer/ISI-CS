 Sharp rise in fiscal deficit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug 1: A higher tax collection during the first three months of the current financial year has failed to contain the yawning fiscal deficit during the quarter, thanks to the increased government expenditure.

 The Centres fiscal deficit has increased 31 per cent to Rs 54,517 crore in the April-June period this year, though tax collection during the reporting quarter was 30 per cent higher at Rs 31,668 crore than Rs 24,306 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.

 Tax mop-up in the first three months was 11.6 per cent of the budget estimate for this fiscal. Last year, the Centres revenue collection till June was 10.4 per cent. Total receipts during the period amounted to Rs 39,067 crore, which was 10.8 per cent of the budgeted Rs 3,63,200 crore for 2005-06.

 But the Centres expenditure increased by over 4 per cent during the first three months of the current fiscal. The total government expenditure shot up to Rs 93,584 crore, which was 18.2 per cent of the budgeted Rs 5,14,344 crore for the whole fiscal.

 While planned expenditure during the period amounted to Rs 24,254 crore, which was 16.9 per cent of the budgeted Rs 1,43,497 crore for 2005-06, non-plan spending of the government stood at Rs 69,330 crore. Interest payment alone accounted for Rs 26,428 crore in non-plan expenditure.

 In these three months, the government has already raised nearly half of its budgeted market borrowings for the entire fiscal. The government has mopped up Rs 54,143 crore between April and June this year through market borrowings against Rs 1,10,291 crore target set in this years budget. 

 According to the comptroller general of accounts, the improved tax collections has even failed to bring down the revenue deficit, which rather rose to Rs 47,311 crore in the first quarter from Rs 46,394 crore in the year-ago period. 

 The revenue deficit till June 30 worked out at 49.6 per cent of the budgeted Rs 95,312 crore for 2005-06, while fiscal deficit amounted to 36.1 per cent of the Rs 1,51,144 crore estimated for the entire fiscal.

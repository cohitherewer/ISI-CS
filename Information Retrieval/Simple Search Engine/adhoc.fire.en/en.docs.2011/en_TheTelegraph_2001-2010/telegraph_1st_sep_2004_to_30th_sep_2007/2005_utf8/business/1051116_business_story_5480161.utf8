 Knight Ridder in search of white knight

 VIKAS BAJAJ

 New York, Nov. 15: Under growing pressure from big shareholders, Knight Ridder, the publisher of 32 newspapers, including The Miami Herald and The Philadelphia Inquirer, said Monday that it was considering a sale of the company. 

 Knight Ridder, which like much of the newspaper industry is contending with falling circulation and tepid revenue growth, said it had hired Goldman Sachs to help it evaluate strategic alternatives. There is no guarantee that it will reach a deal, the firm said. 

 Industry experts said Knight Ridder could attract interest from other newspaper publishers, leading media investors and private equity funds. But they noted that buyers might prefer to buy its properties piecemeal rather than together. 

 On November 1, Private Capital Management, a money management firm in Naples, Fla, that owns 19 per cent of Knight Ridder, cited the flagging stock price and threatened to replace the board or to take it over if it did not aggressively pursue the competitive sale of the company. 

 Two days later, Harris Associates, which owns 8.2 per cent of Knight Ridder and is the third-biggest shareholder, demanded that management solicit offers for the company to maximise the value of Knight Ridder for its shareholders. quot; The second-biggest shareholder, Southeastern Asset Management, did not go that far, but it has asked to meet with management. 

 Since Private Capitals demand became publicly known, Knight Ridders stock has gained new life. It rose 60 cents on Monday to $63.10, and has made up three-fourths of a 21-per-cent-decline in the first 10 months of the year. Based on that price, the company has a market capitalisation of $4.5 billion, up from $3.8 billion at the end of October. 

 The recent actions involving Knight Ridder may be a sign that other chains will face similar demands, said Conrad C. Fink, who teaches newspaper management at the University of Georgia. This is now the opening bell on a round of threats to any publicly owned companies in this country, he said. Those with two classes of stock, like The New York Times and The Washington Post, are protected. I feel that newspaper companies are profoundly undervalued today, and investors are becoming aware of that. This makes it ripe for the picking. 

 The Times Co and The Washington Post Co are publicly traded, but the Sulzberger family controls a majority of Times voting stock and the Graham family has similar control at The Post. 

 Private Capital Management, a subsidiary of Legg Mason, is a major shareholder in many newspaper chains. In addition to 14.6 per cent of The New York Times Co, its holdings include 6 per cent of Gannett, 37.1 per cent of McClatchy and 26.2 per cent of Belo Corp. Private Capital declined to comment on Monday.

 Henry R. Berghoef, director of research at Harris Associates, noted that over the years, newspapers had sold for 12 to 13 times their cash flow. Using that measure, Knight Ridder could fetch $6.1 billion to $6.6 billion. 

 I am not predicting that it would fetch that price, Berghoef said. By the same token, I would say until proven otherwise, we will see. 

 But other analysts, including Lauren Rich Fine of Merrill Lynch, are sceptical that Knight Ridder would command so large a premium. She said that if Gannett emerged as a bidder, it would probably offer no more than $4.8 billion. Measured by circulation, Gannett is the nations largest newspaper publisher, followed by Knight Ridder. 

 Gannett, though, might not bid at all, having recently indicated a preference for investing in non-traditional media companies, Fine said. She suggested Philip Anschutz, a billionaire investor in Denver who has started free papers in San Francisco and Washington, as a possible suitor. A spokesman for his company, Jim Monaghan, said it was not interested in buying Knight Ridder. 

 Newspaper companies, though still profitable, have an uncertain future as the Internet cuts into print readership and revenue. Most newspaper Websites do not charge for their content, for fear that readers will balk at having to pay for it. Advertisers also pay far less for online advertising than for print ads. In addition, online services like Craigslist and Monster have put a big dent in newspapers once-lucrative classified advertising revenue. 

 Those challenges, on top of specific weaknesses at Knight Ridders biggest newspapers, make it unlikely that the company will attract a high-paying suitor, Fine said. 

 Fink agreed that some of the biggest Knight Ridder papers might not be attractive purchases, but said that the chains newspapers in fast-growing markets like Charlotte, N.C., and Columbia, S.C., would be attractive to buyers. There is nothing in the stars that says there has to be a single buyer who can take the whole thing and digest the whole thing, he said. 

 A Knight Ridder spokesman, Polk Laffoon IV, declined to elaborate on the companys announcement. 

 In a rare move for a public company, Knight Ridder also said it would allow investors to submit board nominees and other proposals for all shareholders consideration at the annual meeting on April 18. 

 In a memo to employees, P. Anthony Ridder, the chairman and chief executive, said the company might decide not to sell and he would not say how long the board might take to consider alternatives. He praised the companys journalism and exhorted employees to remain committed in uncertain times. Indeed, a big part of all of our jobs will be to stay focused, he wrote. Nothing could be more critical to the best outcome of the process were now in than that we run our businesses well. 

 In a column published on Sunday, The Philadelphia Inquirers editor, Amanda Bennett, acknowledged the challenges posed by the Internet to newspapers but also noted that her newspapers Web site was the top online destination for residents of the Philadelphia area. 

 Theres no question that newspapers across the country are reeling from the increasing competition from free publications, Internet services and the proliferation of television offerings, she wrote. But dying? Not a chance.

 General Motors zips through dragon land

 Ready for the road

 Shanghai, July 6 (Reuters): General Motors Corp, the worlds top auto maker, posted record first-half sales in China and expects a 20-per-cent-plus growth for the year as it closes in on Volkswagen AG in the worlds number-three vehicle market. 

 The US icon ? which lost $1.1 billion globally in the first quarter ? expects sustained profit from China after it sold 308,722 vehicles in January-June in its second-largest market, up 18.9 per cent from a year earlier, China chief Kevin Wale said. 

 Wales full-year projection was much more aggressive than an April statement that GM wanted to keep pace with the markets expected 10-15 per cent expansion. 

 Despite roaring growth that still leads much of the world, analysts say margins in Chinas auto market have been eaten away by price cuts, high steel prices and cut-throat competition. 

 China continues to be a very solid profit contributor, Wale, a keen golfer who last headed GMs UK operations, said in an interview at offices overlooking Shanghais busy riverfront. 

 Its natural for margins to compress as markets get more mature and more competition comes in. Its our responsibility to find ways to offset that, said the Australian-born executive, who was appointed to his post in March. 

 GMs first-half sales growth lagged PSA Peugeot Citroens 30 per cent from January to May, and Hyundai Motor Cos near-doubling in the first half, though the latter two firms Chinese operations are much smaller. 

 BIG SPENDERS 

 Global auto makers from Ford Motor Co to Honda Motor Co are investing $15 billion to triple capacity to 7 million cars annually by 2008, but that influx of players has wiped out hefty double-digit margins. 

 Average prices dropped 16 per cent in the fourth quarter alone, Nissan has said.

 Oracle snaps up rival software firm

 Towering presence

 Philadelphia, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Oracle Corp on Monday said it will buy rival software company Siebel Systems Inc, which has been long-mentioned as a possible takeover target, for $10.66 a share in a deal that valued Siebel at $5.85 billion.

 Oracle, which will become the worlds biggest customer relationship management software maker if the deal goes through, said the agreement was worth $3.61 billion after subtracting Siebels $2.24 billion in cash.

 The price per share represents a 16.8 per cent premium to Siebels closing share price of $9.13 on Friday.

 Siebel gained prominence in the late 1990s as a top maker of software that helps companies better understand and manage their relationships with customers, one of the markets fastest-growing areas.

 But as Siebels share of that market gets chipped away by stiff competition, analysts have increasingly considered it a prime takeover prize for a rival like Oracle.

 Shares of Siebel jumped around 14 per cent to $10.39 on the Inet electronic brokerage network before Mondays opening bell, while Oracles shares fell 1.7 per cent to $13.06.

 Kaufman Brothers analyst Peter Jacobson said some shareholders might call for Oracle to pay more, but he noted that Siebel has struggled with performance and undergone a lot of organisational change.

 More often than not, these deals go through at agreed-to valuations, Jacobson said.

 Oracle said the companies joint customers have recommended such a deal for more than a year, and Siebel tagged the combination of its software applications with Oracles development capacity as one of the deals strengths. Most of Siebels systems run on the Oracle database.

 Siebel shareholders will receive $10.66 per share in cash unless they elect to be given Oracle common stock ? but no more than 30 per cent of Siebels common shares will be exchanged for Oracle stock. The firms expected the deal to close early next year.

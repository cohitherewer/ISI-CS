 Gas hole in oil books

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Oct. 17: With soaring international prices of LPG, the subsidy bill that the national oil companies have to foot has risen to Rs 125 per cylinder from Rs 95 earlier. They are also losing Rs 14 on every litre of kerosene sold through the public distribution system.

 Indian Oil chairman S. Behuria today said his company would be drained of Rs 5,000 crore due to under-recoveries on the two fuels between April and October. The loss on LPG would be Rs 1500 crore, though a part of this would be reimbursed through government bonds and payments from ONGC, OIL and GAIL. 

 Behuria said there was no need for consumers to worry about LPG as supplies to distributors had been boosted by drawing down existing stocks and increasing imports. 

 He said oil firms had directed distributors to provide single-cylinder households with refills within 24 hours. He, therefore, requested users to stay off panic booking.

 The inventories will be rebuilt to previous levels during November, when the Reliance refinery goes back on stream and more imports of LPG arrive at the ports.

 Officials of petroleum companies were keeping a close watch on LPG distributors. Some were even posing as consumers in telephone calls to dealers to see how they were responding.

 The IOC chairman said the main problem areas for LPG supplies were the north and north-west corridors of the country. These are regions fed by the Reliance refinery at Jamnagar. The refinery, which has been shut down for maintenance, will start operating in mid-November. 

 Behuria said while the oil companies would be doing a tight-rope walk in October and November, the situation in December would change with a possible LPG glut.

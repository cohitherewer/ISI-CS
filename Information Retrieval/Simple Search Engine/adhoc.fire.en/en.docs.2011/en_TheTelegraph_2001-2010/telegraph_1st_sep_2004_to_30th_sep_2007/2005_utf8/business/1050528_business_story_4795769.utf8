 On-site builders to get service tax break

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 27: The government is considering the possibility of waiving service tax on contractors who provide on-site services for building airports, roads, seaports and railway lines.

 We have received a representation from builders associations to exempt site preparation activities from service tax. We are examining the proposal, R. Sekar, joint secretary (tax research unit), Central Board of Excise and Customs, said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by Assocham.

 The Centre had brought construction services within the ambit of the 12 per cent service tax net in the recent budget. But with the government keen to provide an impetus to the creation of infrastructure in the country, it is mulling the option of granting a tax exemption to sub-contractors involved in major infrastructure projects.

 Infrastructure-related construction activities like dam and road building will be exempted from service tax. But it would be imposed on other agents preparing the site for the infrastructure to come up. If the company that sets up the final infrastructure also prepares the site, then the firm will not be taxed, according to a recent rule, which is yet to come into force.

 According to the rule, if the provider of the final infrastructure, say an agency building a dam, was also rendering site preparation services, then it would not be subject to service tax.

 Gautam Ray, joint-secretary (tax research unit) of CBEC, said the department was also looking into the implications of a recent rule which seems to imply that if an Indian receives service abroad, he will be subject to service tax. This rule is also yet to be notified.

 As such, if an Indian ship unloads goods on foreign port and the vessel is repaired there, it will be subject to service tax.

 The shipping industry has expressed its concerns, we are looking into this, he said.

 On the issue of advance payment for future services, he said credit cannot be taken unless the service is received even if tax is already paid.

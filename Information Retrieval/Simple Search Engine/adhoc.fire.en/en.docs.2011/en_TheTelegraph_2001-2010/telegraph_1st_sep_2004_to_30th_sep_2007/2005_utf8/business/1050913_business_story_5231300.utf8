 Mechanism to check validity of oil, gas find

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 12: The petroleum ministry has asked the directorate-general of hydrocarbons (DGH) to put in place a mechanism that will check the validity of any oil and gas strike. This will ensure that announcements of new findings are not misused by companies to rig their share prices.

 The directive to the DGH follows the Securities and Exchange Board of Indias (Sebi) concern over premature announcements of the in-place oil and gas reserves in new fields, which had an impact on the stock market and misled investors.

 Sebi has asked the petroleum ministry to put in place a system to alert investors of any premature declaration or non-disclosure of an oil and gas discovery by a company.

 In a letter to petroleum secretary S.C. Tripathi on September 6, Sebi chairman M. Damadoran said: It will be useful if the DGH or the ministry puts in place a mechanism by which Sebi is alerted whenever there is a premature disclosure or a non-disclosure of development that merits disclosure.

 Damadoran has pointed out that although director-general of hydrocarbons V.K. Sibal had gone on television on September 6 saying Sebi should take action against ONGC for non-disclosure of a reported 6-trillion-cubic-feet gas find, he had not officially informed the market regulator chief. 

 A few months ago, Sibal had gone on air seeking Sebi action against GSPC for a premature announcement of a gas find. GSPC, however, is not listed although it had announced plans for an IPO.

 Damodaran wrote, If the DGH feels that an act of omission has taken place meriting Sebis attention, it would be appropriate to write to Sebi rather than have the regulator learn of his views through television channels.

 Jet takes off with a bang on bourses

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 14: Jet Airways shares soared on debut with investors buying heavily.

 The shares opened at Rs 1,211 on the Bombay Stock Exchange and shot to an intra-day high of Rs 1,339 before touching a low of Rs 1,172 and ended at Rs 1,305, a gain of around 18.6 per cent.

 During the maiden offer, analysts had said the issue was overpriced at Rs 1100 apiece, but the appetite seen today for the Jet shares sent the price spiralling to Rs 1305.

 Jet chairman Naresh Goyal is confident that his airline will remain profitable despite fierce competition. ?I welcome the competition, and we have a business plan to deal with it,? he added. ?The real opportunities are still in front of us. The Indian air travel market is highly under-penetrated, with just 15 million passengers recorded last year,? he said.

 Goyal, who started his career as a ticketing agent for Lebanese International Airlines, is readying to take off on the international stage with his Jet Airways flights to London, Paris and New York.

 ?An NYSE listing is being considered,? said Goyal, who owns 80 per cent of the airline.

 Critics had pointed out that the Jet issue was more expensive than those of British Airways and Singapore Airlines. Merchant bankers, who anchored the issue, said the comparison was wrong. 

 ?One should compare Jet with GOL, the Brazilian airline,? said Ravi Menon, director and co-head, Investment Banking. The market and growth potential in Brazil and India are very similar, he added.

 When founded 13 years ago, Jet Airways was a minnow in comparison with public sector giants like Indian Airlines and Air-India. It challenged state-run carriers for air travel and grew 12 per cent last year.

 Based on the offer price of Rs 1,100, Jet Airways is valued at Rs 9,900 crore, making it Asias seventh-largest airline, more valuable than Thai Airways International and China Southern Airlines Corp.

 The airline will start flights to the US in the first week of May, Goyal said. Perhaps the NYSE listing would improve its image further, analysts said. 

 Jet Airways had garnered 43 per cent of the domestic air travel sales last year.

 Goyal expects the new overseas operations to rake in profits for his airline. ?We have been granted the permission to operate to Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, New York and London. We are hoping to start next month in a phased manner. US and London begins hopefully between April and June,? he added.

 On the National Stock Exchange, Jet saw the capitalisation surging to a whopping Rs 11,259.16 crore, while on the BSE, the scrip was equally aggressively bid, ending with a market cap of Rs 11,266 crore.

 New Delhi, Aug. 10: LML Limited, the ailing two-wheeler manufacturer, hopes to make a turnaround this year itself. The company has been in the red for the last three-and-half years and hopes to be back in the black by the fourth quarter of the current financial year.

 ?We have reduced losses in the first quarter ended June 30 this year. We expect to clock a gross profit in the third quarter of this financial year itself and hope to register a net profit by the fourth quarter,? said Deepak Singhania, managing director of LML Limited.

 The company completed its financial restructuring in March this year. This included mobilisation of fresh funds worth Rs 200 crore through the issue and allotment of shares, warrants and foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) to overseas investors. 

 ?This money is being largely utilised for capacity expansion and rebuilding our balance sheet,? said A.K Chadha, LML?s chief operating officer. Post restructuring, the company?s debt burden declined to Rs 110 crore from Rs 320 crore earlier.

 LML had been undergoing serious difficulties arising out of a shift in the market demand from geared scooters to motorcycles and its inability to readily realign business model to the market needs. Consequently, the company soon became saddled with an accumulated loss of Rs 260 crore. ?But now we hope to wipe out the losses in the next two years,? said Singhania.

 Meanwhile, the company today launched its entry-level 100-cc motorcycle, CRD 100, priced at Rs 31,430 (ex-showroom, Uttar Pradesh). A second variant of this bike comes at a slightly higher price of Rs 32,430. This is LML?s first product launch, post financial restructuring.

 ?We hope to sell 1.6 lakh units of this model in 2005-06,? Singhania said. The motorbike is designed by Ugolini of Italy. The advance microprocessor-controlled ignition system adjusts and varies the ignition timing according to the driving speed resulting in fuel efficiency.

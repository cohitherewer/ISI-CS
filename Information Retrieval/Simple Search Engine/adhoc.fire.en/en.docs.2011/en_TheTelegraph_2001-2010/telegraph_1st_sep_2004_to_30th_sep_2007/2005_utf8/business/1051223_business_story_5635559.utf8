 Sliding sales curve for Ulip

 New Delhi, Dec. 22: Life insurance companies feel that the new guidelines, unveiled on Wednesday, will adversely affect the sales of unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips) in the short-term.

 ?We may see a dip in sales for a few months. This is because some of the guidelines might make the Ulips less attractive,? ING Vysya Life Insurance chief representative N.N. Joshi said.

 ?The industry welcomes the move made by the regulator. It is a step in the right direction to ensure long-term health of insurance companies. This is for their benefit.?

 Ulip is a successful life insurance product generating close to 90 per cent of the new business of private insurers.

 ?It will slow down the growth of Ulip business for some time. But things will soon pick up,? said Sam Ghosh, managing director of Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Company. 

 ?Insurance is for the long-term. The guidelines have reiterated to the masses that they should only consider buying insurance products with a long-term perspective. Else, one should look at mutual funds or bank deposits,? Ghosh added.

 The guidelines were, however, welcomed by companies that are focusing on a balance of protection and asset management.

 Under the guidelines, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has stipulated that the minimum tenure of a Ulip should be five years. 

 Also, the product must have a guaranteed sum assured payable on death.

 IRDA has set a deadline of June 2006 for life insurers to bring about the required modifications in their existing products.

 Clarifying that the sum assured on maturity cannot be linked entirely to capital market performance, IRDA said such guarantees provided on death or on maturity should be reasonable and consistent with the current and long-term interest rate scenario.

 ?Demonstration of proper pricing, including the appropriateness through sensitivity and scenario testing, is required under the file and use procedure for the guarantees provided for,? said IRDA.

 Raha seeks fresh date for output review

 S.P.S. PANNU

 Raha: On course

 New Delhi, Dec. 11: ONGC chairman Subir Raha has sought a fresh date from the petroleum ministry for a meeting to end the tug-of-war over the mandatory production MoU and review the companys performance in the current fiscal.

 Every year, oil PSUs sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the government, stating the crude production target for the year.

 Rahas stance was since no MoU had been signed in the current fiscal, the quarterly review meetings were unnecessary as the performance had to be judged with reference to the targets set in the MoU.

 As a result, the companys performance review has been delayed by seven months.

 On August 26, Raha said in a letter to petroleum secretary S.C. Tripathi: It is the practice in quarterly performance reviews to review the actual performance against the target set in the MoU. Since the MoU for 2005-06 is pending in the ministry for your signature, the review cannot be carried out.

 However, four days later, Tripathi wrote a letter to Raha, saying, The MoU for 2005-06 is not pending at the ministry for my signature. You may kindly see the joint secretarys letter requesting a revised MoU according to the recommendations of the task force be sent to the government at the earliest.

 In the absence of an MoU, a quarterly review can take place on the basis of a draft agreement and ONGC Videshs (OVL) targets as a corporate. You may like to consider this matter. Let me know if the revised date for the quarterly review can be scheduled for September 2, Tripathis letter added.

 Senior officials said Raha realises that the impasse cannot continue indefinitely as the task force of the department of public enterprises has already given its recommendations in the matter.

 The task force has agreed with the ONGC management that the domestic output for crude cannot be raised to 35 million tonnes as it would lead to a flogging of the wells.

 However, it has agreed with the ministry that the performance of OVL should also be brought within the ambit of the MoU.

 However, in a letter on May 8, the ONGC chairman had asked for the signing of an MoU with the rider ? facts and principles are non-negotiable.

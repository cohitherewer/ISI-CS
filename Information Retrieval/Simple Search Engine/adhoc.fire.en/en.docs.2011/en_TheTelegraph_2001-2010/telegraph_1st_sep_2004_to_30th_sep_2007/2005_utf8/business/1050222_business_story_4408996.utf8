 MTNL pulls up socks to boot out merger move

 M RAJENDRAN

 Maran: Two in one

 New Delhi, Feb. 21: Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd is readying to ramp up its subscriber base and enhance the enterprise value of the company in a subtle move designed to nix communications minister Dayanidhi Maran?s plan to work out a synergistic relationship with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd.

 The major telecom operator in Delhi and Mumbai is on an expansion spree to widen its subscriber base. Senior MTNL board members had an informal discussion with the employees about possible synergies that may be suggested by ICICI Securities to the government.

 The government has appointed ICICI Securities to suggest whether a synergy is possible between the two state-owned telecom titans that includes merger of the two, breaking down of both or either of the public sector company into a service-based subsidiary. The last option is not to disturb the existing arrangement ? and MTNL is trying hard to make sure that is what is ultimately decided.

 R. S. P. Sinha, chairman and managing director of Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd, is gung-ho about adding another 40 lakh subscribers soon. He has announced that MTNL will float a tender for 4 million GSM lines as part of its expansion plans. Currently, MTNL has 6.89 lakh GSM mobile subscribers both in Delhi and Mumbai.

 Sinha said, quot;We had placed orders with Motorola following the tendering process for 8 million GSM line and another tender of the same quantity last year. The 4 million tender will be floated in a few days. This will help us to meet the growing demand for our phones. quot;

 The company will invest about $456.3 million as part of the expansion plans to be completed over the next two years. 

 Sources in MTNL said, quot;This is one of the ways that would make buy out of any sort (MTNL buying BSNL or BSNL buying into MTNL) beyond the reach of the government. Even if either of the company has to buy out the governments equity it would be a costly affair. quot;

 Sinha : Other plans

 A senior MTNL official said, ?Any synergy that does not take into account the employees views will not be tolerated. Our members are all prepared to launch an agitation at a short notice. We are happy that the board is confident that expansion will not only result in requesting again to the government to allow MTNL to operate services in Chennai and Calcutta, but also make us one of most profitable public sector companies. quot; 

 quot;MTNL is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and both the consultant and the government are aware of this. Hence, we do not expect any proposal that will be detrimental too the value of the company, quot; the officer said. 

 During the five-year plan period-2002-2007, MTNL has been given a target to add 16 lakh landline/WLL telephones and 11.57 lakh mobile phones. While BSNL has a target to add 2.18 crore mobile phones during the plan period.

 According to analyst in International Finance Corporation, quot;The strategy to expand the subscriber base to avoid any financial constraint (to make its difficult for BSNL to buy MTNL or if MTNL invests in BSNL) is good. But, whatever the proposal the consultants offers, the final authority is the government and it has the necessary powers to merge the two companies. quot;

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: Motorola will use the distribution network of Bharti Teletech to increase its market share in India, which is currently less than 10 per cent.

 The US telecom equipment company has formed a strategic relationship with Bharti Teletech, the fixed-phone handset manufacturer and distributor of set-top boxes. This will help Motorola reach out to metros, cities and small towns. Bharti Teletech has a network of over 250 distributors and more than 11,000 retailers across the country.

 Motorola chief Edward J. Zander had vowed to improve the firms market share in India with a series of initiatives. The tie-up is the first of such initiatives.

 Bharti Teletech vice-chairman and managing director Rakesh Bharti Mittal said, Our understanding of the domestic market, a strong brand presence, distribution reach across the country and the experience and expertise of marketing products to local customers should be a perfect match for Motorolas growth strategy in India. The alliance will help us widen our product portfolio and leverage economies of scale.

 Motorola is also in an advanced stage of negotiations with the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) to bundle mobile phones based on the GSM technology.

 The company will also roll out a slew of models targeted at the mid- and low-end market segments. Motorola will also launch a sub-Rs 2000 handset by the year-end to widen its reach.

 Bharti Teletechs access to the burgeoning rural market will be used by Motorola to connect the unconnected by providing handsets like the C113a suited for mass-market users. Its distribution network in urban cities will allow Motorola to reach the growing population of professionals eager for the latest high-end handsets, including RAZR V3.

 Motorolas pact to extend its product availability for consumers in the market through Bharti Teletechs national network underscores the US firms continued commitment and focus in India. 

 Allen Burnes, vice-president of high growth markets, mobile devices business, Motorola Inc, said, The company is committed to delivering on its vision of connecting the unconnected here in India. Together with Bharti Teletechs outstanding distribution network we will bring even greater reach and choice of mobile communications to consumers in India wherever they are.

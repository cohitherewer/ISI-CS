 Calcutta, Feb. 16: The Netherlands has identified certain key areas of investment in Bengal. These include agriculture and food processing, banking services, infrastructure and water management.

 ?Though Holland is the eighth largest trading nation in the world with a share of 3.5 per cent of the total trade, its business with India accounts for less that 0.5 per cent. Also, just 0.5 per cent of the total Dutch FDI and exports flow to India. It is high time that trade relations are boosted,? Royal Netherlands Embassy deputy head of mission D?sir?e Bonis said at a seminar organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 Bilateral trade between India and the Netherlands was around 1520.24 million euro in 2003.

 ?There is a need to focus on food processing as only 1 per cent of the total agricultural produce is currently being processed,? said Bonis. ?This is an area in which we have huge expertise.?

 Dutch banks ABN Amro, ING and Rabobank already have a significant presence in India.

 Dutch consultancy firm DHV is already assisting the state government in improving the water supply in the city.

 ?India has been identified as an emerging market under the PSOM programme. Projects under this programme aim at simulating corporate Indo-Dutch investment,? said Bonis.

 ?Such projects try out new production methods or services on a pilot scale in order to determine whether commercial operations are feasible. The projects thus pave the way for long-term trade relations.?

 PSOM is the Dutch abbreviation for Programme for Co-operation with Emerging Markets.

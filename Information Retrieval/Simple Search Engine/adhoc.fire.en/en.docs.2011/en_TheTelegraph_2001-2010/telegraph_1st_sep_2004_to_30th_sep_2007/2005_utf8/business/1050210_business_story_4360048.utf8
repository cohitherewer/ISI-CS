 Tax returns a mouse-click away

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 9: Income taxpayers will soon be able to file their tax returns on the Internet.

 The Union cabinet today cleared a Rs-101.25-crore proposal to implement the second phase of the tax information network (TIN) that will pave the way for electronic filing of income-tax returns.

 The second phase of the TIN, which is hosted by the National Security Depository Limited, will enable dematerialisation of TDS (tax deducted at source) and TCS (tax collected at source) certificates, computerisation of annual information returns of high-value transactions and integration of information relating to processing of income-tax returns. 

 According to an official statement, the cross verification of TDS and TCS deduction vis-a-vis credit claimed is expected to help income-tax authorities check frauds.

 E-filing of returns is a facility that is already available but is too cumbersome in its present format to be of much use. At present, taxpayers still have to file returns in the paper format, which defeats the very purpose of electronic filing. Moreover, it can be done only through a few designated agencies. 

 More than 4.35 lakh TDS returns are reported to have been filed electronically with the tax information network.

 The e-filing of TDS returns by the government and corporate deductors will eliminate the requirement for enclosed copies of documents like challans, which, in turn, is expected to result in a significant reduction in the cost of compliance.

 The computerisation of annual information returns will make it easier for the income-tax authorities to identify the big fish and help in both widening and deepening the country?s direct tax base, which, as a percentage of the GDP, is lagging way behind the advanced countries. 

 The necessary legal changes have been made in the income tax with effect from April 1, 2005, to enable the setting up of the tax information network. 

 Phase-II of the system approved today will be implemented over a period of three years with Rs 33.75 crore being spent every year on the scheme.

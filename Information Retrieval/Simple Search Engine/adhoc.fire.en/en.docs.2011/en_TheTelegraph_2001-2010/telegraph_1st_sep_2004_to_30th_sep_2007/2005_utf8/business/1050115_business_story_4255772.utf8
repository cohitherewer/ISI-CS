 Paints body seeks import duty change

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 14: The domestic paints industry today sought changes in the custom duty structure in the coming budget and demanded that the duty on raw materials should be at least 15 per cent less than that imposed on finished products. 

 According to the Indian Paint Association (IPA), the apex body of the industry, the import content of raw materials used for industrial coatings is almost 60 per cent, while that for architectural coatings stands between 20 per cent and 40 per cent.

 ?In both categories, the raw materials and paints attract the same basic customs duty. This is not justified. The duty on raw materials should be at least 15 per cent less than the duty imposed on finished paints,? IPA added.

 The demand comes at a time when global crude oil prices are showing signs of hardening. The association said the recent rise in crude prices has put pressure on input costs of raw materials and containers, increasing the final cost of paints. 

 The paints association said following the rise in crude prices, small-scale paint manufacturers have found input costs to be far too high and have been unable to increase the prices of the finished products commensurately. Further, their margins have eroded and in many cases the viability of many units is at stake.

 The size of the Indian paints market is estimated to be around one million tonnes and the market value is put at Rs 6000 crore. Out of this, 70 per cent is architectural paints, while industrial paints constitute the remaining portion. 

 During the previous financial year, the industry grew by 12 per cent. However in the current fiscal, the industry has slowed and the growth is expected to be around 9 per cent. 

 The IPA, in its charter of demand to finance minister P. Chidambaram, said the current maximum retail price (MRP) system extends only to the products in the paints industry. But paint companies manufacture and market powder coatings, which are not covered under the MRP system. This, it said, has put the paints industry in an ?anomalous situation?. The industry, therefore, demanded that the latter be brought under Section 4A for assessment on MRP basis. 

 Three-day exhibition 

 The 22nd Indian Paint Conference amp; Exhibition got off to a colourful start in Mumbai today.

 Over a thousand delegates from the country and abroad are participating in the three-day conference being organised by IPA. The participants will highlight new trends, discuss new developments and throw light on the latest technologies available to the paints industry.

 Spencer profit rises

 London, Nov. 8 (Reuters): Marks amp; Spencer Plc showed further signs of recovery with a rise in first-half profits on Tuesday and chief executive Stuart Rose welcomed designer George Davies back into the fold following a short-lived lovers tiff.

 Pretax profits, stated under the IFRS rules, came in almost 20 per cent higher at ?308 million ($538 million) compared with a restated ?258 million a year ago.

 M amp;S also said designer George Davies ? who only three weeks ago said he would leave the companys Per Una division which he founded amid a spat over contract terms -- would stay on and become chairman of the fashion unit next July.

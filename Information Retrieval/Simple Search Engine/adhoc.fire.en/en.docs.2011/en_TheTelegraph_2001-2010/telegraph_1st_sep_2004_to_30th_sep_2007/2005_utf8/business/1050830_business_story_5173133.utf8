 Rush to end on a high note

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 29: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has detected a sustained shift from low-denomination notes to higher ones in a change largely fuelled by the increasing use of bank automated teller machines (ATMs). 

 Demand for Rs 500 notes has increased mainly due to ATMs, the central bank said in its annual report. The zest for large-value notes comes against a backdrop of a 2 per cent decline in coins clanging around in 2004-05 against a rise of 3.8 per cent in the previous financial year.

 There were not many takers for Rs 5 coins either, but notes of the same value were popular. The coins of 5 paise, 10 paise and 20 paise are not in demand, the report said.

 As a result, all coins of lower denomination will be phased out, irrespective of their metal composition; cupro-nickel coins of 25 paise, 50 paise and one rupee will go out too. Banks will accept these and send them to mints.

 In value terms, the largest share in circulation was that of Rs 500 notes; by volume, it was Rs 100. Together, they accounted for 76.4 per cent of the currency value.

 New equity plan from Principal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 11: Principal Mutual Fund today launched a new diversified equity scheme called Principal Junior Cap Fund, which is open for initial public subscription till June 8. After that the scheme will close and reopen later for repurchase.

 The funds choice of stocks for the portfolio will have a bias towards companies that comprise the CNX Nifty Junior index. The index is made up of 50 most liquid stocks excluded from S amp;P CNX Nifty index.

 The fund will pick up companies from the CNX Nifty Junior, said Rajat Jain, chief investment officer of Principal PNB Asset Management Company, which is managing the fund. 

 For the last three years, the index has been consistently outperforming other indices such as S amp;P CNX and BSE Sensex, he explained.

 However, the fund seeks to keep its investments flexible between companies with different market capitalisation ? large cap stocks complemented by mid cap ones ? a strategy that has caught on with the mutual fund houses this season.

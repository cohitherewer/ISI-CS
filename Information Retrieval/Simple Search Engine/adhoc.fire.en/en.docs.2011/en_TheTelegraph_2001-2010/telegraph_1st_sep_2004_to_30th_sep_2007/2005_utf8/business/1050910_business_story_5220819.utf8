 Bharti-Changi sees airport surety snag 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 9: The Bharti-Changi consortium has told the government it is worried that the Singapore entity would have to pay an $80-million guarantee in bidding for the Delhi and Mumbai airport revamps.

 We have placed the concerns of Changi before the government. We await a response from it, a spokesperson for the Bharti group said. Civil aviation ministry officials said it was difficult to change bid norms announced recently, though there would be talks within an inter-ministry group looking at the issue. 

 They argued that performance guarantees were usually the norm in most global bids and were usually paid by the implementing partner, usually the foreign party. However, if any combine wants to share the guarantee costs equally that is their look out. The government will not stand in the way, the officials said. 

 Several local and consortiums are bidding for modernisation of the two key airports. These include the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani group, DLF-Malaysia Airport Holdings Berhad (which runs Kuala Lumpur airport) and the Hyderabad-based GMR group in collaboration with Fraport AG (which runs the Frankfurt airport).

 Ready for take-off

 Civil aviation minister Praful Patel said the government would go ahead with the modernisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports, though a Parliamentary panel had suggested developing greenfield hubs in the two cities. 

 He said the September 14 deadline for submission of bids was final. Technical and financial bids will be invited within a month of it. The Centres decision is final, Patel said.

 On August 30, the transaction document for restructuring and modernisation of airports was sent to the eight shortlisted bidders, making it mandatory for the winner to carry out major works like building a second runway at Delhis IGI airport in the next two years.

 To win the contract, the eight bidders will be required to submit technical and financial bids by September 14.

 On the initial public offers Indian airlines and Air-India, Patel said they could be launched in the next year. He said the government had appointed a committee for restructuring the directorate general of civil aviation. It is a highly technical and complex issue. We need to keep the best international practices in mind.

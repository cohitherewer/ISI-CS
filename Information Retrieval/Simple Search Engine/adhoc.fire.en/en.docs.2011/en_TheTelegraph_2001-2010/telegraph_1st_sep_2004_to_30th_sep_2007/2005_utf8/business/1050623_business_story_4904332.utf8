 Power plants face coal shortage

 New Delhi, June 22 (PTI): Sixteen thermal power plants and five super thermal power plants are facing critical stock position, the ministry of statistics and programme implementation said today.

 In its review report, the ministry said the thermal power stations ? Ahmedabad, Wanakbori, Satpura, Korba, Nellore, Simhadri, Mettur, Barauni, Kahalgaon, Bakreshwar, Kolaghat, Durgapur and Farakka ? have virt- ually exhausted their coal stock.

 The super thermal power positions facing critical stock position were Korba, Farakka, Simhadri, Kahalgaon and Bakreshwar stations. 

 Though these power units received more than 100 per cent of their coal linkages their position continued to be critical, due to higher consumption and low linkage, the report pointed out.

 The overall coal production during April this year was 30.50 million tonnes. The pithead stock of coal at the mines of Coal India was 22.05 million tonnes.

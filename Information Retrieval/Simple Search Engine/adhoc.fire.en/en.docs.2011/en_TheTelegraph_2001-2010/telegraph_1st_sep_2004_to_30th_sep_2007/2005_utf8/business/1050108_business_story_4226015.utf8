 Tata Tele, Reliance get stop-ad call

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: The telecom regulator has directed Tata Teleservices and Reliance Infocomm to immediately stop advertisements that claim fixed wireless phones can be used as mobile phones.

 To stop the use of fixed wireless sets as mobile phones, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India today asked Tata Teleservices to withdraw advertisements of its fixed wireless service as ?Walky?. The regulator issued a similar directive to Reliance Infocomm asking it to withdraw commercials of its fixed wireless service, which is described as unlimited cordless.

 Referring to a fixed wireless phone service as ?Walky? or ?Unlimited cordless? conveys a message to potential customers that the service is similar to mobiles, when in reality only fixed wireless service is being offered.

 The interconnect usage and access deficit charge regime provides different treatment for calls from mobile and fixed services, including fixed wireless. The authority has directed both the operators to withdraw from the market all promotional materials. Corrections should be made in website contents.?

 Tata Teleservices and Reliance Infocomm have been directed to file a compliance report by January 13. 

 The two companies, however, said they will decide on the course of action after consulting their legal counsel. But cellular operators say mere withdrawal of advertisements would not help as the two companies can continue to offer the service.

 T. V. Ramachandran, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), said: ?It is a move that does not justify the corrective intent of the regulator. The operators should be asked to stop mobile service from fixed wireless phones. Withdrawal of ads is no solution.?

 The regulator, however, said this is a move to stop operators from misleading the public and the misuse of fixed wireless as mobile phone will be taken up later.

 Trai member D. P. S. Seth said: ?A fixed wireless set cannot be used as a mobile phone. If an operator violates the licence agreement, the issue would be examined. We are examining allegations against the two operators. Withdrawal of advertisements was important so people are not misled.?

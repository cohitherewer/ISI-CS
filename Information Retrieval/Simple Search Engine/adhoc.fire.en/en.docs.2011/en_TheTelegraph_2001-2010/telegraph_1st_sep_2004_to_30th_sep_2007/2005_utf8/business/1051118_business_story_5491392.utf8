 Moodys pats RIL demerger

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Good marks

 Mumbai, Nov. 17: Moodys Investors Services, the global credit rating agency, today gave its thumbs up to the demerger plan at Reliance Industries by upgrading the petrochemical giants foreign currency bonds rating to Baa3 from Ba2 and assigned a local currency issuer rating of Baa3.

 Moodys also said if the demerger plan goes through by April next year, both ratings could be upgraded to Baa2.

 According to Moodys, the action was prompted by Reliances continued strong operational and financial profiles, which remain supported by its dominant market position in refining and petrochemicals, the benefits of economies of scale, its low cost integrated operations, the strong level of domestic demand and the favourable outlook for the petrochemicals industry in the next 12-18 months.

 These profiles, together with its sound credit metrics, support a solid investment grade rating, it observed. Last June, soon after the Ambani clan decided to carve up Dhirubhais Rs 100,000-crore empire, Moodys had said it would review Reliance Industries Ba2 rating for a possible upgrade.

 Averring that the demerger plan is largely positive, Moodys said several benefits came from it. Apart from preserving the current operational efficiency and synergies within its refining/petrochemical business, the plan would help reduce the uncertainty regarding contingent financial risk or support attached to its associated investments, such as telecom, which is capital intensive.

 Moreover, the demerger will also not result in any significant cash outflow. 

 The demerger will result in lower dividend or investment income of about Rs 500 crore, it pointed out. The rating agency said if the demerger plan doesnt go through by April next year, it expects to confirm Reliances ratings at Baa3 with a stable outlook. 

 The plan involves the demerger of Reliance Infocomm, Reliance Energy Ltd and Reliance Capital Ltd into a new holding company, and in which Reliances core businesses, including petrochemicals, refining, exploration and production (E amp;P) and IPCL will remain intact.

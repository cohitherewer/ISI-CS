 Calcutta, July 25: BOC India is looking at Rs 1500-crore business opportunity from the steel sector in the next four to five years.

 BOC managing director E. R. Raj Narayanan said, The massive expansion programmes announced by different steel companies would generate a substantial gas business for us.

 The industrial gas producer is looking at long-term dedicated gas supply contracts with steel majors. All big players, such as Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Tata Steel, the Ispat group, the Jindal group, Mittal Steel and Posco have decided to go ahead with big expansion plans.

 We will pitch for their gas projects as and when there is an opportunity, Narayanan said on the sidelines of the companys 69th annual general meeting in Calcutta on Monday. 

 Iron ore-rich states, such as Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Orissa, are the hot-spots for new steel plants. 

 It is projected that new facilities with a total of 40-million-tonne steel producing capacity will come up in the next 4-5 years.

 Apart from steel, BOC also plans to increase its non-steel portfolio by diversifying into new sectors.

 Chemicals and petrochemical sectors are also witnessing new capacity additions in the country and BOC is keeping an eye on that opportunity, too.

 At present, 70 per cent of its process gas solutions (PGS) business comes from the steel sector. BOC is targeting a 50 per cent contribution to its total PGS business from the non-steel sectors over the next two to three years.

 We are trying to develop business models for industries like downstream oil and gas and chemicals to become the leading industrial gas producer in the country going forward, Narayanan pointed out. 

 However, the company will have to face stiff competition from other global players who are now foraying into India with the opportunities unfolding here. 

 But, BOC believes that the application development support from its UK parent, the BOC Group, will be a critical factor in building an edge over the competitors.

 Steel-makers see robust price revival

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Raising the bar

 Mumbai, Aug. 21: An anticipated rise of 7 per cent in steel prices from September may signal the start of an upswing that lasts till the end of this calendar year, helping boost an industry laid low by a slump of 24 per cent in the last quarter. 

 Global prices, which influence the rates that buyers at home pay for steel, are on their way up, lifted by shrinking inventories and output cuts in key markets outside China ? the worlds largest buyer of the commodity.

 Industry watchers say global prices have already hardened $50 a tonne to $480 over the past fortnight. This could push up cost at home by at least Rs 500 per tonne next month. 

 The good news does not end here. According to a recent report put out by World Steel Dynamics, the steel market is likely to ride the upturn, on the back of new bookings, at least until October. The report goes on to add that from December to March, steel-makers could reap the gains of a spurt in new orders in the US and Europe.

 Peter F. Marcus, whose views on where prices are headed weigh heavily on the industry, lists the reasons for the sudden upturn. According to him, a large number of buyers tend to believe that once prices bounce off the bottom, the chances of a reversal are extremely rare.

 Steel mills in the US, where steel demand this year is forecast at 128 million tonnes (against 127 million tonnes last year), expect automotive orders to be stronger.

 In China, which sparked the rally in global prices, hot-rolled coils cost more now than they did a couple of months back. More important, this has come at a time when there has been no sizeable reduction in production in that country.

 Though industry watchers in India are not willing to stick their necks out on the possibility of a hike after September, most of them agree that domestic demand will remain strong. On a conservative estimate, they see the growth rate in the current financial year at 8 per cent.

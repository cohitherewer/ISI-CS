 Preference queue for Basel bus

 GAURAV CHOUDHURY

 New Delhi, Oct. 2: Banks are likely to float a mix of preference shares and hybrid debt instruments to raise funds even as they prepare to make a smooth transition to a new capital adequacy regime under the Basel II norms.

 Basel II is a new codified system of rules for international banking that will come into force from March 31, 2007. It aims to standardise minimum capital requirements for the global banking system by tightening capital adequacy and other prudential requirements.

 Last February, finance minister P. Chidambaram had announced that banks would be allowed to issue preference shares to raise capital. However, the banks will be allowed to float the preference shares only after legislation is passed to amend the banking laws.

 Banks in India used to issue preference shares but the practice was stopped after their nationalisation in 1969. Preference shares give its owners some benefits: it entitles them to a higher dividend and gives them the first charge on assets (which means they get paid before anybody else if the bank collapses).

 The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is unlikely to allow easy conversion of preference shares into equity to prevent any takeover bids. Unlike equity, preference shares are non-voting stock. 

 Banking sources said the RBI would come out with elaborate guidelines detailing terms and conditions for the issue of preference shares. They said that the conversion of these shares into equity would be allowed only under exceptional circumstances.

 Under Basel II norms, the capital requirements are more risk-sensitive. The norms require banks to hold capital to cover not only for credit and market risk but also their operational risks. Moreover, they are required to hold capital to meet concentration risks and liquidity risks.

 Concentration risk broadly refers to concentration of credit to a particular segment of industry, while liquidity risk involves cash management in the banking system.

 Preference shares are a type of shares that carry a right to a fixed percentage dividend of the nominal value before ordinary shareholders receive anything. It also yields a fixed dividend unlike an equity share which yields a variable return.

 The bill to amend the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Act was introduced in the budget session this year and has been referred to the standing committee on finance for its recommendations. 

 The RBI will also set a limit on the issue of preference shares. Globally, the limits on issue of preference shares differ from country to country and there are cases where the limit is set as a certain proportion of the Tier I capital.

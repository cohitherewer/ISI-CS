The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 BK offers Kumar Enka baton

 A STAFF REPORTER

 B. K. Birla, Sarala Devi Birla and Kumar Mangalam Birla: All in the family

 Calcutta, June 28: It?s a case of grandfather proposes, grandson disposes, but all in good humour. 

 Basant Kumar, the patriarch of the BK Birla empire, wants to pass the baton of polyester maker Century Enka to grandson Kumar Mangalam Birla, if he agrees that is.

 ?I am willing to give it to Kumar whenever he wants. But he says I should continue as long as possible,? Birla said.

 The octogenarian feels that age is not on his side and his grandson, head of the AV Birla group, should take over Century Enka.

 Indian promoters hold a 13.25 per cent stake in Century Enka. However, following the open offer launched to buy out foreign promoter Accordis Overseas Investment BV, the promoter stake will rise substantially.

 Accordis owns 38.24 per cent. The company will buy back 30 per cent from the foreign promoter. 

 Interestingly, Grasim Industries, the AV Birla group flagship, is the single largest shareholder in Century Enka.

 The AV Birla group is one of the largest polyester fabric players with operations in India and abroad. Century Enka could well fit into the business of the group.

 B. K. Birla had also proposed to hand over Mangalam Cement, a company named after his grandson, to Kumar Birla. However, he declined the offer.

 He had suggested that Pilani Investment, a holding company which has shares in all major Birla companies, could go to Kumar Mangalam if the latter agreed to buy out the stakes of other Birla factions in Pilani.

 Open offer

 Accordis could even exit completely from Century Enka, B. K. Birla said. Following the buy back at Rs 122 apiece, the remaining shares could be sold in the market.

 Enka?s shares are now trading at over Rs 200, so it would be more remunerative for the foreign partner to sell its share in the market instead of the buy back plan, which was approved at the firm?s 39th annual general meeting.

 Expansion plan

 The company has chalked out a plan to invest Rs 160 crore in expansion of its nylon tyre cord fabric facility. It will also increase the nylon textile yarn capacity.

 UTI Bank net profit at Rs 93 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 14: UTI Bank has registered a 31 per cent growth in net profit in the first quarter of the current year at Rs 92.63 crore compared with Rs 70.67 crore in the same period last fiscal.

 The bank, which has been reaping rich dividends from surging retail demand for credit, saw its core net interest income (NII) rising 33 per cent to Rs 222.48 crore from Rs 167.14 crore during the same period last year.

 However, there was a fall in yield from advances and investments.

 The net interest margin was lower at 2.66 per cent against 3.05 per cent in the preceding year. 

 UTI Bank said the fall in the net interest income was largely because of a management strategy to increase the size of the bank.

 Advances grew to Rs 15,666 crore from Rs 9,910 crore in the previous year, registering a growth of 58 per cent.

 The banks balancesheet was Rs 38014 crore compared with Rs 23886 crore in the year-ago period.

 States to get more powers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 17: The union finance ministry is thinking of increasing the financial powers of the states to implement the central government schemes. The ministry may also raise the expenditure limit of various central government ministries and departments to speed up the decision making process. 

 A senior official told The Telegraph that the issues were discussed at a meeting held by the finance minister P. Chidambaram with the financial advisors of different ministries here today.

 Chidambaram had convened todays the meeting to take stock of the allocation and expenditure of various Union ministries and departments during the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2005. The finance minister intends to hold such meetings every quarter to keep a tab on fiscal management and control.

 There will also be a greater emphasis on the ministries clearly spelling out what had been achieved with the fund allocated under each head. This is to ensure a greater degree of accountability in the use of the funds. 

 The government feels that a greater delegation of powers will speed up the implementation of various social welfare schemes which are sponsored by the Centre and implemented by individual states. 

 This assumes significance in the light of the Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs ambitious scheme to develop the countrys rural infrastructure. The Prime Minister is also expected to meet the deputy commissioners of all the districts in the country to understand the problems encountered at the implementation level. 

 The finance minister reportedly has taken strong exception to false statement of fund utilisation by various government departments. A close inspection has revealed instances where funds were parked in various interest earning schemes and shown as spent under various heads.

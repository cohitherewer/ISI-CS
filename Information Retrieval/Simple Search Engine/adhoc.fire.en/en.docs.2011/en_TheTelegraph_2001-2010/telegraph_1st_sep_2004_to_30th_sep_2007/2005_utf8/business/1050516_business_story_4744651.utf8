 LSE offers easier listing rules

 New Delhi, May 15 (PTI): Come July, Indian companies planning to tap the global depository receipts (GDR) market will not have to disclose their income if they list on London Stock Exchange (LSE).

 The British stock exchange is creating a separate market segment from July 2005, which will exempt Indian firms from disclosing their income as per stringent global accounting norms. 

 We are creating a new market segment, which will allow Indian companies to list GDR issues on LSE using Indian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to disclose their financial statement, LSE head of business development for India, Hugh Sandeman, said. 

 However, the new market segment will allow GDRs to be sold only to qualified institutional buyers and not to retail investors.

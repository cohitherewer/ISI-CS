 Euro near recent records

 London, Dec. 31 (Reuters): The euro traded a touch below its recent lifetime records against the dollar and the yen in the last session of the year on Friday as investors bet Europe?s single currency will continue to benefit from a weak dollar in 2005. 

 Persistent imbalances in the US economy will likely continue to weigh on the dollar next year after pushing up the euro more than eight percent in 2004 to record highs versus the US currency. 

 And expectations of further dollar weakness have led the euro to notch up new record highs for the last six trading sessions, peaking at $1.3667 on Thursday. 

 On Friday, it stood at $1.3640 at 4:55 a.m while trading volumes dried up on New Years Eve. Japanese markets were fully closed, and markets were expected to close early in parts of Europe and the United States. 

 ?Looking at euro/dollar, we are witnessing the structural weakness of the dollar, quot; said Paul Mackel, currency strategist at ABN Amro in London. 

 ?Next week the market is going to focus on how far will this go in 2005. quot;

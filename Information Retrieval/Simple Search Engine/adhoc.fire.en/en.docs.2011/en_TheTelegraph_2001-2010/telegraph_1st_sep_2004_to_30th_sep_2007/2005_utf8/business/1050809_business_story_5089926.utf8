 Calcutta, Aug. 8: Corporation Bank may float a public issue in the next financial year to bring down the government?s stake in the bank to 51 per cent. 

 At present, the government?s holding in the Mangalore-based bank is 57 per cent. The bank?s shares are trading around Rs 475.

 ?Our capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is 17.16 per cent. If by the next financial year the CAR comes down we may consider an issue. But there is no firm plan as of now,? chairman and managing director V.K. Chopra told reporters today. He was in the city to address a banking conclave organised by Ficci (eastern region).

 The net worth of the bank stands at Rs 3,200 crore.

 Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) holds a 26 per cent stake in the bank. As part of an agreement with LIC, the bank has opened 131 branches within its premises. It also provides cash management services to LIC. 

 The bank hopes to do business worth Rs 56,000 crore in the current financial year. Last year, the figure achieved was Rs 45,500 crore.

 In the first quarter (April?June) of this fiscal the bank has posted a net profit of Rs 124 crore. 

 ?We are expecting a credit growth of 25-30 per cent in the current financial year,? he added. The credit deposit ratio of the bank stands at 69 per cent.

 The bank has a network of 1665 branches and plans to take it to 2000 by March 31, 2006. ?Seventy per cent of the new branches will be outside south India,? Chopra said.

 Corporation Bank?s 478 branches are under core banking solutions. It has 804 interconnected ATMs.

 The bank is also making its first foray in the international market. It has applied to the Reserve Bank of India for opening representative offices in Dubai and Hong Kong. ?The RBI clearance is expected within two months,? added Chopra.

 Home merger

 Corp Home, the housing finance arm of Corporation Bank, is all set to merge with the bank. The board has approved the merger. ?We are awaiting court approval. We expect that the merger will take place in the current financial year,? Chopra said.

 Following the merger, Corp Home?s Rs 300 crore worth of assets will be transferred to the bank.

 However, Corp Securities, another subsidiary of the bank, suffered a loss in the last fiscal.

 Indian Bank IPO

 Indian Bank today ruled out an initial public offering (IPO) till its balance sheet was restructured.

 ?We are not planning an IPO at the moment,? bank chairman K. C. Chakrabarty told reporters here.

 He said the bank, which had been issued recapitalisation bonds of over Rs 4,500 crore by the Union government some years back, was waiting for the Centre to take the initiative in restructuring its balance sheet to ?offset? the losses.

 Calcutta, April 13: Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) is looking at developing its available land resource in and around the city.

 Apart from a proactive role in creating infrastructure for industry, the port is also considering real estate development to make a fast buck.

 The port has about 1,600 acres of encumbered and 150 acre of free land in its kitty, making it one of the potentially richest ports in the country.

 Chairman A. K. Chanda said the port was looking at various options to develop land in and around Calcutta. ?We have identified the areas. The port is looking for high-yielding projects,? he said.

 CPT has properties in some lucrative locations within the city, ideal for development for housing and retail activities.

 The port has been trying to formulate a land policy for long, but it was held up because of a delay in approval from the shipping ministry.

 Apart from estate development in the non-traditional sector, CPT is also promoting port-based industries within its locale.

 For instance, it is building a tea park at Khidderpore along with the Tea Board of India. CPT will develop the basic infrastructure and allocate land for different units for processing and packaging of tea for exports. With the help of the state government, the tea park could also get a special economic zone (SEZ) status.

 The model of the port-linked SEZ has got a tremendous leg-up following the success in south China, which India has been trying to emulate. Gujarat has been successful in implementing the model. The proposed Kulpi port in the state will also be SEZ-based.

 Chanda said the port was looking at developing other commodity-based industries as well. This could include a chemical park in Haldia.

 Profit soars

 CPT has clocked a net profit of Rs 156 crore for 2004-05 compared with Rs 113.28 crore in the previous year, registering a rise of 38 per cent. The port has handled 46.15 million tonnes cargo compared with 41,26 tonnes last year, making it the second largest in the country after Vishakhapatnam. The port achieved a balanced growth across all categories.

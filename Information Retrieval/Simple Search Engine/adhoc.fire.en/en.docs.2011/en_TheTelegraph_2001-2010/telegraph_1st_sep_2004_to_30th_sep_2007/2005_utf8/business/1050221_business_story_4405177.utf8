 Financial adviser or master of blah. Chandralekha Tulal sees what lies behind the glib talk

 Jack Welch

 Investment advisers are now coming out of the woodwork: they are everywhere and they sport a variety of badges to get investors to repose confidence in their skills. 

 They call themselves financial consultants, financial advisers, financial planners, investment consultants, investment advisers. They work with banks, they are brokers and accountants, or the friendly neighbourhood insurance agent who makes a tidy sum by purveying investment advice of doubtful currency or just plain, good ol? con artists.

 Why do they think we need them?

 It is because they know that when it comes to financial investment and planning most of us are just a bunch of twits. We are not aware ? and we make no effort to bone up on the options that are available to us. It?s not that we are afraid of trusting our own financial judgement: it?s just the nerve-jangling fear that you could lose money on a dud investment. And the wrath of the spouse when she or he gets to hear of it.

 So, we look for a safety net of investment choices from advisers whose merits we neither know nor can ascertain and, therefore, tend to rely on approbation by word of mouth.

 We need their services because we seek expert opinion on retirement plans, investments, family finances, estate plans, insurance coverage, and income taxes. Experts in these areas can guide us through a maze of laws, rules, and regulations. Their suggestions and recommendations can verify that our plans are sound, whether our assumptions are valid and whether the various aspects of our finances are free of conflict with one another.

 Today, the financial services industry recognises that consumers increasingly expect broad-based financial services, so these providers have changed the way they market themselves to the public. And, as can be expected, many assert they provide the best possible personal financial planning services found anywhere.

 Well, maybe they do. Maybe. But theres more to providing personal financial services than selecting a job title that attracts consumers. As that consumer, you need objective advice, and you also need to assure yourself that the financial professional you select possesses the necessary experience, expertise and integrity. How, then, will you find the person you need?

 In more evolved economies, the various factors guiding the financial planners such as their fees, credentials, code of conduct and other related factors are guided by a proper regulatory framework. In our country, just about anyone representing any financial product or service institution passes off with the tag of a financial planner.

 Says Ranjeet S. Mudholkar, chief executive officer, Association of Financial Planners, ?At present, the advisers in India offer product-based advice and it essentially depends on the commissions from the product manufacturers. The most common tool used by advisers to attract new customers and to retain the existing ones has been to offer rebates based on the commission earned from the product manufacturers.

 ?Due to the product-centric nature of the advisers, investors normally do not get the optimum portfolio, and thus always run the risk of a risk-return mismatch.?

 Adds Mudholkar, ?This works very well for the customers also since they are made to believe that such financial advice comes to them for free. They fail to realise the difference between advising and selling.?

 However, such a situation has made investors extremely wary and mistrustful of such fly-by-night operators, who shift loyalties across companies paying the most lucrative commission.

 A Sebi-NCAER survey said, quot;.. approximately 43 per cent of the investors do not invest in the stock market because of lack of confidence in the brokers?. quot;

 Mudholkar says, ?It is extremely important to regulate these unlicensed players who offer such services. quot;

 In the developed countries, one can look for the diploma on the wall and the initials after the name of ones financial planner. 

 It is true that in India, there are some required certifications before one becomes eligible to sell financial products. One needs to get certified by the Association of Mutual Funds of India (Amfi) prior to selling mutual funds. Similarly, for selling insurance products, it is necessary to undergo a 100-hour training programme of the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).

 However, such training provides only basic understanding about specific products and does not equip one to make complete financial planning for individuals, argues Mudholkar.

 In India, the field of Certified Financial Planner (CFP) has recently opened up. CFP courses are offered by International College of Financial Planning (branches in major cities), Ritu Nanda Insurance Services College of Management (Delhi), Guardian Institute of Financial Planning (Bangalore), DIMS Centre of Finance and Research (Delhi). Such CFPs provide complete financial planning to individuals and charge a fee in return. Investors can look for such qualifications before choosing an adviser.

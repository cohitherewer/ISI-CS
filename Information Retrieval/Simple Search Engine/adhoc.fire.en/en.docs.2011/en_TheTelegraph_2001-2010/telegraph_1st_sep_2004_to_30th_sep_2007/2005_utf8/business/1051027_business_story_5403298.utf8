 Brand India gets tech push

 Maran: Image builder

 New Delhi, Oct. 26: The department of information technology will soon release a roadmap to popularise the dot IN domain names and dot IN e-mail addresses that will help improve Brand India globally. 

 The government is evolving a roadmap for implementing multilingual domain names known as internationalised domain names under Devnagari and Dravidian scripts, said Union communications minister Dayanidhi Maran.

 Launching HCLs initiative to integrate domain and e-mail infrastructure globally under dot IN here today, Maran said more dot IN domain names and dot IN e-mail addresses would help popularise the IT capability of the country. He also inaugurated HCLs state-of-the-art building, which is touted as the largest dedicated remote infrastructure management facility in the country. 

 The Indian ICT industry is at a maturing stage and some companies have achieved consolidation. Double digit growth figures, now a part of the software-ITeS industry, have helped the sector touch Rs 97,860 crore in 2004?05, making it a high potential segment within the Indian economy, Maran said.

 The IT-enabled services (ITeS) sector has recorded a compounded annual growth rate of 32 per cent over the last five years. Its share in the countrys economic output has more than trebled to 4 per cent in 2004-05 from 1.2 per cent in 1997?98, he added.

 Online e-commerce transactions are likely to go up to Rs 2,300 crore in 2006-07 against Rs 570 crore in 2004-05. About 55 per cent visitors to e-commerce sites have adopted the Internet as a shopping medium, he said. Today, an e-mail address and a website are a necessity. Any self respecting business or enterprise will have a website.

 About 35 accredited domain name registrars across the country have registered 1,41,000 names till date, up from 6,500 names registered 10 months back, he added. 

 BPO business

 The government today said attempts were being made to prevent India from taking a lead in IT and business process outsourcing business.

 This is an attempt to tarnish the image of India. We should not give much credibility to such reports. The recent Nasscom report about the growth of investment in BPO and the new clients to Indian companies is a testimony about its credibility, Maran said.

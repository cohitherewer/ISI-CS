 S amp;P reality check on growth

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 4: Economic development in China and India is crucial for the success of the global economy, Standard amp; Poor?s (S amp;P) today said in an article titled ?China, India, and the fate of globalisation?. However, it cautioned that India was unlikely to sustain the high growth achieved by East Asian tiger economies.

 ?China and India are global success stories in reducing poverty and moving towards a prosperous market economy,? said Joydeep Mukherji, credit analyst at S amp;P. Since China began initiating economic reforms in 1978, its national income has more than quadrupled and since India began liberalising its economy in 1991, its per capita GDP has almost doubled, he added.

 He said the failure to modernise one or both the countries would limit the successfully ?globalised? parts of the world to large pockets in the West and East Asia ? excluding half the world?s population and potentially threatening the long-term stability of the global economy. 

 ?India is a politically open society that is slowly embracing the market economy, while China is a closed society moving to a market economy from a semi-market one,? he said. Though China may achieve first world status before India, it will have to avoid a political hard-landing, he added. 

 The report warned India of high fiscal deficit and debt burden. ?The Indian government runs larger fiscal deficits and has accumulated more debt as a share of GDP than its Chinese counterpart,? the article observed. It pointed out that India is unlikely to follow the path of other Asian tigers, such as Korea, Taiwan or even China, in attaining rapid growth rates over a prolonged period of time. 

 India may follow the path of Thailand or Italy, which experienced good economic growth and falling poverty, thanks to a dynamic private sector, despite many years of squabbling coalition governments or it may follow Brazil, a large country with an impressive private sector, the report said. In contrast, China may follow the path of Taiwan and Korea, which have grown rapidly under authoritarian governments.

 The report said the main political risk in India is poor implementation of policies and slow pace of reforms that could undermine economic growth prospects.

 ?In such a scenario, a combination of slow GDP growth and rising fiscal deficits could boost the Indian government?s already-high debt burden, weakening its creditworthiness,? it said. 

 While growth may accelerate modestly in India and decelerate in China over the next decade, the latter?s lower population growth rate is likely to ensure a slightly higher per capita growth, Mukherji said. 

 Mukherji said India began its reform with industry and largely ignored agriculture until just recently. Hence, it has not benefited from a substantial increase in productivity and income on the farm, which would have reduced rural poverty at a faster rate. India lags behind China in the development of rural and agro-industry because of restrictive industrial policies and poor rural infrastructure.

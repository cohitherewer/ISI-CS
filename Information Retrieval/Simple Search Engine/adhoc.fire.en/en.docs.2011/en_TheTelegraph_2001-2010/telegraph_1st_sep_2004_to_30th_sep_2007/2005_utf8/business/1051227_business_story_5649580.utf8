 New Delhi, Dec. 26: Here?s some music for the ears. Mobile music is now the most valuable mobile content market globally with gross revenues of $4.4 billion in 2005 and an estimated $6 billion in 2006. Mobile music accounts for nearly 15 per cent of the entire music market globally. 

 With 35-40 per cent of non-voice revenues being generated by music (aggregating an estimated Rs 300 crore in 2004-05), cellular operators in India are beefing up their networks to cater to the growing clamour for music-and video-based services. 

 In India, the mobile music revenue potential is about Rs 200-500 crore. Industry experts said, ?In India only the tip has been scratched and cellular operators have generated just about Rs 20-25 crore of revenue from music downloads.? 

 The music industry is looking at this trend with interest. In the next few years revenues from this stream might outstrip that from the more conventional channels (record and CD sales).

 A senior Motorola executive said, ?A silent revolution has happened in music, the way it is transmitted and accessed. It not just riding on iPods but also telephones. Walkman phones and MP3 phones have been launched, where you can listen to your favourite music station.? 

 Call it music rocking the telecom sector or telecom shaking up the music industry, it?s music for both. 

 Industry sources say about 25 million ringtones and ringback tones are downloaded every month by mobile customers across the country. 

 Online stockbroker Sharekhan predicts that sales of these tones alone will generate over Rs 880 crore by 2007. 

 A senior telecom industry analyst said, ?Contrast this with the revenues of the music industry. It fell by a third over the past three years to Rs 600 crore, largely due to piracy. That figure is expected to double by the end of the year.? 

 The telecom firms are also alive to the opportunity. AirTel has launched ?music at ease? for its broadband customers. K. Krishnan, executive director of AirTel broadband amp; Telephone Services, said: ?New and innovative offerings are the key to increase the adoption and use of broadband in the country. Good quality music has a universal appeal and with our tieup with Soundbuzz, we bring to our customers the latest music available on some of the worlds best music labels.?

 According to industry experts, more than 125,000 ring tones are downloaded every day at an average price of Rs 8 to Rs 10. It has also caught on fast with landline customers. AirTel provides caller ringback tone service for its fixed-line customers. 

 Operators like Reliance and Bharat Sanchar Nigam are betting big on video ringtones. Estimates suggest that the penetration of caller ringback tones for Hutch exceeds 20 per cent of its base. Airtel and Hutch offer more than 10,000 songs in 18 languages across India.

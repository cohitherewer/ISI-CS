 FM gets an update

 New Delhi, Dec. 21 (PTI): Sebi chairman M. Damodaran today met finance minister P. Chidambaram and apprised him on the current situation in the capital market, which is witnessing a bull phase with the sensex hovering at over 9339 points.

 Finance ministry sources termed the meeting as just a courtesy call. However, the meeting assumes importance in the light of the recent bull phase in the capital market and the crackdown by the regulator on market manipulators.

 The current bullish trend has a lot to do with not only domestic investors but also foreign institutional investors (FIIs). The FIIs have pumped in about $10 billion this year after viewing the strong fundamentals of the Indian economy that posted 8.1 per cent growth in the first half of 2005-06.

 The meeting also comes three weeks after the Lahiri panel submitted its report on encouraging FII flows and checking the vulnerability of capital markets to speculative flow.

 Damodaran, who also inaugurated a workshop on capital market for financial journalists here, chose not to comment on the report.

 Its the governments committee. Sebi has no role in it, he said when asked if Sebi favoured a ban on participatory notes issued by FIIs.

 The RBIs stance was that the issue of participatory notes should not be permitted, although the finance ministry panel headed by chief economic adviser Ashok Lahiri had stated that the current dispensation for participatory notes may continue.

 The RBI had stated that the main concerns regarding issue of participatory notes are that the nature of the beneficial owner or the identity of investors will not be known, unlike in the case of FIIs registered with a financial regulator.

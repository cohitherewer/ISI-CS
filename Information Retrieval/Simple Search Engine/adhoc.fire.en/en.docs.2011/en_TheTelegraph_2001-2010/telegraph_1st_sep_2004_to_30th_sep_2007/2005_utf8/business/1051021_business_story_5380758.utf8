 SAIL raises bar: 50 mt in 25 years 

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Oct. 20: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) plans to ramp up its production capacity of finished steel to 39 million tonnes by 2019-20 and 61 million tonnes by 2029-30.

 So far, the public sector company has disclosed its corporate plan for 2011-12, by which time it intends to increase the capacity to 20 million tonnes of finished steel from 11 million tonnes at present. The country?s total production is 34 million tonnes.

 The new projections are based on the fact that the company will continue to hold 30-35 per cent of country?s steel-making capacity in future.

 The development is significant as SAIL?s nearest competitor, Tata Steel, has also upped its projection to a capacity of 30-35 million tonnes by 2015. 

 SAIL?s projections are to be viewed in conjunction with the plans of global giants like Mittal Steel, Posco and Arcelor, which have finalised their India plans.

 Mittal Steel and Posco are planning to have large capacities ? 12 million tonnes each ? in the next five to seven years. Arcelor has also reached an in-principle decision to come to India and a firm strategy will be put in place in six months.

 ?In its draft steel policy, the government has indicated that the finished steel demand will grow from the existing level of 35 million tonnes to 110 million tonnes by 2020. Keeping the market share of SAIL unchanged atabout 30-35 per cent, we have envisaged that finished steel should reach 39 million tonnes by 2019-20,? executive director (raw material) B.N. Singh said.

 The company envisaged that the growth rate beyond 2025 will taper off to 3.5 per cent and by 2029-30, SAIL?s production should be around 61 million tonnes of the national production of 175 million tonnes. From now to that period, the growth rate is expected to stay at 7 per cent.

 SAIL has started making investment provisions for the corporate plan of 2011-12 ? the company?s immediate target. The company has not talked about setting up a new plant unlike Tata Steel.

 SAIL has plants in Bhilai, Durgapur, Rourkella and Bokaro. It has also recently merged Burnpur and IISCO with itself. According to the corporate plans, SAIL is increasing the capacity of its existing plants to reach 20 million tonnes by 2011-12.

 Going forward, the company may have to look at new locations as well. However, it remains to be seen if Indian demand continues to be robust as the pundits are predicting.

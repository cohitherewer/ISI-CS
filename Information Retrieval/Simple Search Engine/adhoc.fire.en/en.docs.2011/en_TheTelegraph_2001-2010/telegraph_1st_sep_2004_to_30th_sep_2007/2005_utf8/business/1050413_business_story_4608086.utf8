 Power Finance posts lower net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 12: Power Finance Corporation has registered a 39 per cent fall in net profit at Rs 980 crore in 2004-05 against Rs 1,606.99 crore in the previous fiscal. However, it is bullish about the market and is planning to go for an initial public offer by June. A senior company official said an IPO is scheduled in the next two months. 

 ?It all depends on the approval of the cabinet. We will soon place a proposal before the cabinet,? said sources in the company. The IPO would include a 10 per cent stake-sale by the government and a 10 per cent fresh equity offer. 

 PFC has a paid-up capital of Rs 1,030 crore. Both the finance ministry and the Planning Commission are understood to have approved its proposal to raise up to 10 per cent equity or Rs 103 crore at a face value of the paid-up capital.

 Commenting on the fall in net profits, the official said this was due to changes in the accounting policy in respect of loans from cash to accrual basis. 

 Additional deferred tax liability in respect of special reserves resulted in lower income for the fiscal ended March 31 by Rs 141.62 crore.

 PFC disbursed Rs 9,405 crore during the financial year 2004-05 against Rs 8,974 crore in the previous fiscal. 

 The corporation sanctioned Rs 18,573-crore loan last fiscal. It has already disbursed Rs 1,010 crore in the current financial year.

 Talking about the corporation?s future business strategies, the official said PFC was looking at banking and insurance sectors to raise resources at cheaper rates.

 Shifting from its policy of financing state sector projects, PFC sanctioned loans to 10 private projects amounting to Rs 4,181 crore. These projects include Lanco 300 MW, Nagarjuna 1015 MW, Jindal Power 500 MW and Torrent Power?s 1050 MW power plants.

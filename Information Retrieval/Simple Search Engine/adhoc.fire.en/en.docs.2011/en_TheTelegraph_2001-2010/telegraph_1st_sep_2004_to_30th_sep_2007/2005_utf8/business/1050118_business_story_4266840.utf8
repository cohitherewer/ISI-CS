 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Goenka: Keeping his word

 Calcutta, Jan. 17: G. P. Goenka, the promoter of Duncans Industries Limited, has infused Rs 12.5 crore fresh equity into the company as part of the debt restructuring package okayed by banks and financial institutions (FIs).

 According to the Rs 600-crore package, Goenka is supposed to chip in fresh equity of Rs 25 crore. Duncans Industries chairman Goenka told The Telegraph, ?I have put in the first tranche of money as outlined in the debt restructuring package. I will put in the remaining in the second tranche. We will meet the basic tenets of the package.?

 Goenka said banks and FIs have also agreed to give the company Rs 62 crore as loans. SBI Caps had worked out the debt recast programme for the company.

 Duncans Industries needs Rs 100 crore to restart its fertiliser plant at Panki near Kanpur. 

 The restructuring proposal envisages funding through capital infusion and loans from financial institutions. The company used to produce fertiliser under the brand name Chand Chhap.

 At present, the total debt exposure of the company is Rs 600 crore, including Rs 90 crore of fixed deposits.

 Asked when will the company pay its fixed deposit holders, Goenka said, ?We will pay up the fixed deposit holders according to the scheme approved by Calcutta High Court. We will stick to the schedule worked out by the court.?

 On whether the company will have to liquidate its assets, Goenka said if the restructuring package calls for such a move, it will be carried out. 

 He, however, ruled out any immediate plan to sell tea estates. 

 He is of the view that the depressed condition in the tea market cannot continue forever. 

 ?Prices are bound to pick up. In fact, we are witnessing firming up of tea prices in recent months. Overall, the year 2004 was better than 2003 when prices of tea crashed heavily,? Goenka added.

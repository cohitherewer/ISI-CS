 New Delhi, July 12: India and China have decided to resist attempts by western countries to divide the developing nations by splitting them into sub-categories at the WTO talks.

 They have jointly voiced serious concern over attempts by some developed countries to sub-classify the developing nations so as to divide them at a time when WTO negotiations on key issues, like agriculture and services, have reached a critical stage.

 According to an official statement issued here today, commerce minister Kamal Nath and his Chinese counterpart Bo Xilai have met on the sidelines of the informal ministerial meeting at Dalian in China. 

 During their 50-minute meeting last night, both Nath and Xilai have expressed their resolve to resist attempts to divide the developing nations.

 Xilai drew Naths attention to developed countries attempts at sub-classifying the developing countries into advanced developing countries, developing countries and least developed countries in order to create conflict of interests amongst them. 

 The ministers took the joint stand that developing countries should be treated as one whole entity and be accorded effective special and differential treatment, as mandated in the Doha agenda.

 India and China will work together in the current Doha round of world trade talks based on their shared interests and concerns in many areas of the ongoing negotiations in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), including agriculture and non-agricultural market access, the ministers are reported to have said.

 Nath has indicated that developing countries, including the least developed countries, would intensify their interaction before the sixth Hong Kong ministerial meeting due in December.

 Development issues must be addressed upfront as the Doha agenda was meant essentially to be a development round and not just a market access round, he said.

 Nath and Xilai have stressed that export subsidies should be eliminated by 2010, domestic support in agriculture be brought down and there should be a level-playing field for developing countries before they are asked to open their markets.

 In the past, India and China have paid a price for unfair trade. Developed countries should take the lead in making commitments in the WTO, Nath said.

 Xilai and Nath are reported to have held extensive talks on how to maintain unity among developing countries so that their interests are protected at the WTO trade talks.

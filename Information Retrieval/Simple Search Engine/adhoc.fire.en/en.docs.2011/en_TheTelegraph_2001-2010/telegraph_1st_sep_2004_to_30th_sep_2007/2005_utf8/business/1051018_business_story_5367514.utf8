 Capital hike, bonus on Dabur menu

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 17: Dabur India Ltd is weighing the options of increasing its authorised share capital and issuing bonus shares.

 A company spokesperson told The Telegraph that the next board meeting, scheduled for October 24, will take up both issues.

 The top management has been considering increasing the authorised share capital for some time, he said.

 At present, the authorised share capital is Rs 50 crore ? a figure considered significantly low in relation to the companys revenue levels, which topped Rs 1,500 crore last year.

 The spokesperson said the company, which is debt-free, went public 11 years ago and the current authorised share capital does not commensurate the existing size of the business.

 The company has a paid-up capital of Rs 28.66 crore.

 The company launched its last public issue in 1994, a year after it issued bonus shares in a ratio of 4:1.

 The spokesperson said the board would seek the approval of shareholders on the share capital increase through a postal ballot. Under the existing ownership structure, the promoters ? the Burman family ? hold a 76.73 per cent stake, followed by financial institutions (8.85 per cent).

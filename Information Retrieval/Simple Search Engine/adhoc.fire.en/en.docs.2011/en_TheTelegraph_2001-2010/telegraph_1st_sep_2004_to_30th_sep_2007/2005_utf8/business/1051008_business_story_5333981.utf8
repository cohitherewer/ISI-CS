 New Delhi, Oct. 7: Barista Coffee is going places. The company plans to set up shop in Scotland, Singapore and Bangladesh.

 Senior company officials said overseas expansion plans are expected to be firmed up within the next three to six months. 

 The coffee retailer, which has over 120 outlets (espresso bars and espresso corners) across 17 cities in India, will adopt the franchisee route for its overseas markets.

 ?We do not have any acquisition plans either for the overseas or domestic market. There is no plan for a joint venture,? Partha Dattagupta, CEO of Barista Coffee, told The Telegraph.

 At present, Barista has an outlet in Sri Lanka as a joint venture and a franchisee-run outlet in Dubai. It also has a captive coffee bean roastery in Venice.

 Dattagupta said the company has received enquiries from Bangladesh, Singapore, Malaysia, Mauritius and Scotland and is evaluating these proposals. ?Hopefully, over the next three to six months we should get our act together,? he said.

 Barista plans to open 50 more domestic outlets entirely owned and operated by the company in the coming months.

 ?By the end of 2005-06, we should be present in Guwahati, Coimbatore, Surat, Goa and others,? he said.

 However, the franchisee model is a strict no-no for the domestic market, at least till the end of this fiscal. The company has only one franchisee outlet in India. It was set up in Bangalore as a ?test case?. 

 ?Although the experience has been good, we want to evolve further before taking the franchisee route in the domestic market,? he said.

 Dattagupta said the company?s expansion plans over the next three years would involve an investment of Rs 60 crore. 

 He said the chain will also put forward a more diversified palate of eatables on the menu over and above its flagship coffee offerings.

 The company is not expecting much competition from new international chains. 

 ?The entry of newer players will ensure that the number of footfalls increase. Therefore, classically, the market should grow,? he said.

 The present size of the coffee retailing market is estimated to be around Rs 250 crore.

 Barista Coffee was established in 2000 to provide the typical Italian neighbourhood espresso bar experience. In 2001, Tata Coffee formed a joint venture with Barista Coffee Company. It was later bought over by the Sterling Infotech group.

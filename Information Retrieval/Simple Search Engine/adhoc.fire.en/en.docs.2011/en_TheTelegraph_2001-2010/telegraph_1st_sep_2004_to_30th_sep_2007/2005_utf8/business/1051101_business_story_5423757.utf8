 NIIT explores more scope in China 

 M. RAJENDRAN

 Pawar: Eyeing for more

 Shanghai, Oct. 31: NIIT has trained its sights on two important government projects in China. 

 NIIT, which had set shop in China in 1996, wants to expand its operations and capture big customers.

 With a slogan of NIIT inside, the company has embedded its curriculum and training methodology in over 20 Chinese Universities and colleges across 25 provinces and 100 locations. The Indian IT firm wants to tie up with more universities in China.

 NIIT is bullish on the possibility of various exchange programmes. It also wants to set up a university in China.

 Prakash Menon, country head of NIIT China, a fully owned subsidiary of NIIT Ltd, pointed out the benefits that Indian software companies have over their competitors from Europe. As Indians, we still hold a respect in the area of software. The Chinese are always ready to learn. Parents have a lot of trust in NIITs role in the development of a child and securing a job for it.

 It is a major responsibility. We have to develop products and learning capsules continuously and get the specialist to teach them. Language was a problem, but they are fast catching up with English, said Menon.

 A major global power shift is currently underway. Business analysts and industry watchers are actively debating whether the worlds two great economies ? China and India ? can actually get together to create larger synergies and achieve common goals. 

 We entered China as early as 1996 ? the first Indian ICT company to do so. A foreign player entering the Chinese education market was completely unheard of in those days, NIIT chairman Rajendra S. Pawar said.

 But the Chinese government gave NIIT a go-ahead to set up operations in Shanghai in March 1998. The IT education company entered into a joint venture with the Municipal Education Arm of Pudong.

 NIIT launched two centres in Shanghai. Our early-bird endeavours were given the red carpet treatment in China. The centres ran successfully and we learnt to sell, recruit staff, train and maintain our trainers, said Menon.

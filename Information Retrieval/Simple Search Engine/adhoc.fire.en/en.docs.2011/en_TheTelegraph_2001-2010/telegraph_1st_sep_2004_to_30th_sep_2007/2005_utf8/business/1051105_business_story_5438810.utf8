 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Reaching out

 Mumbai, Nov. 4: Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd finally got cracking on its long-awaited Bina refinery with the board today approving an investment of Rs 1,996 crore for the project.

 Bharat Petroleums investment in Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd (BORL) will represent 50 per cent of the latters total equity.

 The project consists of a 6-million-tonne refinery at Bina in Madhya Pradesh. It also includes a single-point mooring system and crude oil terminal at Vadinar in Gujarat. There would be a 935-km cross-country crude oil pipeline from Vadinar to Bina.

 The project costs, including the interest during construction, is expected to be around Rs 9,000 crore at current rates and is likely to be commissioned by December 2009. It was held up for a long time due to delays in obtaining environmental clearances, which were received last year.

 Bharat Petroleum told stock exchanges that BORL is negotiating with banks and financial institutions for raising the loans and the terms are likely to be finalised shortly. The products manufactured by BORL would largely be marketed in the central and northern regions.

 Recently, at its annual general meeting, senior BPCL officials had said the company is likely to offload a 25 per cent stake in the project to investors that may include upstream companies, financial institutions or private equity funds.

 Ashok Sinha, BPCL chairman had said while the corporation will hold a 50 per cent stake in the venture, Oman Oil will have close to 3 per cent. The corporation will part-finance the project through an initial public offering (IPO) that is expected to raise close to Rs 1,000 crore. BORLs 25 per cent equity will also be offered through the IPO. 

 Earlier, the corporation had said it is not averse to providing infrastructure to a third-party player who could set up a petrochemical plant at the site of the refinery.

 Sinha had told shareholders at the meeting that the talks with the Madhya Pradesh government for tax concessions for the project was fruitful. It has received deferment of local sales tax to the extent of Rs 250 crore annually along with the waiver of central sales tax for a period of 15 years.

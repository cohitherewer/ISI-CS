 Cautious approach to selloff policy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Feb. 28: Divestment is a dirty word ? and it didn?t figure today in finance minister P. Chidambaram?s budget speech.

 It didn?t even figure as a receipt in the government?s accounts. But that doesn?t mean that the selloff of the government?s stake in state-owned units is off.

 Officials say the Congress-led government decided not to wave the red rag of divestment before the Leftist bull. 

 Divestment will certainly remain alive and kicking and might actually be stepped up from the current year?s target of Rs 4,000 crore.

 Chidambaram himself says that on divestment, he will ?go according to the pace allowed by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs?.

 The pace is likely to be quite fast given the fact that the government has already set up a divestment proceeds fund where the money from initial public offerings of state-run companies will be parked. Cash raised from the sale of ailing PSUs will also go into this corpus.

 Money from the fund, which was created last month, will be used to turn around other PSUs and will also be funnelled into social sector projects, helping the government bridge budgetary gaps in completing promised projects.

 These are objectives that the Left itself had ordained. It, therefore, makes it harder for them to complain about actual sales of the PSU stock.

 Officials say the government is likely to piggy-back on some of the initial public offerings (IPOs) that the best-known PSUs will float this year. Air India, Indian Airlines, ONGC, Nalco, Bhel and Maruti are tipped to be among the state-run firms, which will come out with IPOs.

 Several key banks like Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda, Oriental Bank of Commerce and Allahabad Bank are in the process of coming out with public issues as well. Canara Bank, Andhra Bank, Vijaya Bank, Syndicate Bank and Uco Bank are also expected to tap the market after March.

 The government will reap huge profits if it uses the opportunity to divest a small shareholding in these PSUs. For instance, if the government were to make an offering of a 5 per cent stake in ONGC, it would be richer by Rs 7,000 crore. The price-earnings ratio of most state-run firms is less than 10, which could create a huge appetite for these issues.

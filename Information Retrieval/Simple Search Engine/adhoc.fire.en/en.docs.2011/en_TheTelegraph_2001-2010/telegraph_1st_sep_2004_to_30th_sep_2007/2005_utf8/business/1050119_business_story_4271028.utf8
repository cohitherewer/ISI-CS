 Aiyar: Hardsell mantra

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar has launched a hard-sell drive to woo foreign companies to the Indian oil hunt in 20 exploration blocks being offered under the fifth round of the new exploration licensing policy (NELP-V).

 Launching the first roadshow at Petrotech-2005 here today, the minister said the government had set May 31 as the deadline for receiving bids. These would be processed within two months. The production-sharing contracts will be signed with the successful bidders before September 30.

 He said the entire procedure in the current round had been streamlined to meet international standards and cut red tape so that exploration work could start by the first week of next year.

 The minister said investors would have access to a single-window clearance to ensure faster approvals. A senior official would provide the support required by investors and a special committee under the minister would monitor the progress of the NELP round.

 The 20 blocks for oil and gas exploration being offered through global competition are expected to attract an investment of $1 billion in the first phase. 

 Six of these are deep-sea blocks, two in shallow water, while 12 are onshore. Of the deep-water blocks, two each are on the east and west coasts and two in the Andaman area.

 The shallow water blocks are situated on the west coast, while the 12 onshore blocks are spread across eight basins ? Assam, Arakan, Cambay, Rajasthan, Kaveri, Ganga valley, Vindhya, Deccan Syneclise and Krishna Godavari.

 Besides these, ONGC will offer stakes in five deep-sea blocks ? three in the Krishna-Godavari basin, one in Kerala Konkan offshore and one off the Kutch coast.

 Digital data rooms are being set up in Delhi, Houston, London, Calgary and Dubai to provide the geological details of the blocks.

 The minister will be leaving for London for a roadshow on January 20-21. He will then go to Dubai on January 24-25. This will be followed by campaigns in Houston (January 31 and February 1), Calgary (February 3-4), and possibly in Moscow (February 14), he said.

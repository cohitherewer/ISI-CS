 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Nov. 23: State-run Bank of India is gearing up to reduce its gross non-performing assets (NPAs) to 3 per cent and net NPAs to 1.5 per cent by March next year. 

 Speaking to reporters here today the banks chairman and managing director M. Balachandran said, We have been able to bring down our gross and net NPAs at 4.5 per cent and 2.33 per cent, respectively, through the recovery of bad loans worth Rs 800 crore in cash last fiscal. We are now targeting at bringing it further down to 3 per cent (gross NPA) and 1.5 per cent (net NPA) by next year, he said. 

 He that as part of a consolidation exercise, BoI has proposed to open up more branches overseas with an investment of $100 million over the next two years to facilitate NRIs and ethnic groups to do business and transactions with India.

 Balachandran said: We are planning to set up new branches or acquire banking entities in Japan, USA, the UK, West Asia and Belgium (Antwerp) to promote diamond and jewellery trade in India. BoI has already made its mark in in China, Vietnam, Indonesia and Tanzania, he added.

 Balachandran said the bank has already set up a global processing hub in Singapore and all its 23 overseas branches have been networked through the Internet to provide technology-aided benefits to its customers in India and abroad.

 He said the bank has plans to increase its ATM kiosks in rural areas from 56 to 150 by the end of the year. We will also set up 10-15 mobile ATMs to augment rural and urban retail banking. The mobile ATM of Mumbai proved to be a boon to customers during the recent rains and floods in the state.

 Balachandran said the bank has decided to provide online trading facility and set up portfolio management centres to exploit the internal human resource and technical resources.

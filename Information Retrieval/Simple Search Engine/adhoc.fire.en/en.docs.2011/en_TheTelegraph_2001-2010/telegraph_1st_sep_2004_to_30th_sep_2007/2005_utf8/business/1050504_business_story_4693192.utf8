 Three more wait in the wings

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 3: The government today said it has received applications for the launch of three airlines ? Paramount Airways Private Ltd, Visaa Airways Private Ltd. and Magic Air Private Ltd. 

 However, civil aviation minister Praful Patel, who gave this information in Parliament today, did not give details of the applications. 

 He, however, declined to put a date for commencement of air services by these operators, saying it would depend on their compliance with the civil aviation requirements set by the government. 

 ?It would not be possible to indicate a firm date for the commencement of operation by these carriers, quot; he said, adding that their startup would depend on compliance with government?s civil aviation policy.

 Three more private airlines ? Kingfisher, Royal and Spicejet have also been given permission to launch services.

 Kingfisher recently took possession of an Airbus plane while, Royal Airways, an offshoot of ModiLuft, has already placed orders for two aircrafts.

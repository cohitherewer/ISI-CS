 Ashok Leyland profit races to Rs 54 crore

 Jan. 25 (PTI): Hinduja group flagship Ashok Leyland today reported a 41 per cent rise in bottomline to Rs 53.65 crore for the quarter ended December. It had posted a net profit of Rs 37.98 crore in the same quarter previous fiscal. The company is confident that the market is buoyant to fuel further growth.

 While the number of vehicles sold in the reporting quarter rose marginally to 12,831 units (12,489), turnover increased 15.79 per cent to touch Rs 1,143.35 crore compared with Rs 987.4 crore in the same period last year, the company said in a release.

 Managing director R. Seshasayee said a shift in product-mix and pricing strategy, which was compelled by the rise in input costs, have contributed to the improved turnover.

 ?We have countered pressures on margins with price corrections as also cost containment through e-sourcing and value engineering. Availability of low-cost funds due to the foreign currency convertible notes issue has helped us reduce costs by nearly 60 per cent,? he said.

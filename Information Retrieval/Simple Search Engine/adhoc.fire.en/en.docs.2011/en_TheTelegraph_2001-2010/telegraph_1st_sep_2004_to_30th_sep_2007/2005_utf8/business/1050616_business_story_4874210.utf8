 Opec boost fails to cool crude

 Vienna, June 15 (Reuters): Opec lifted oil output limits on Wednesday but, bumping up against full capacity, failed to make any immediate dent in $55 a barrel crude.

 The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) agreed to raise its formal production quotas by 500,000 barrels a day to 28 million BPD.

 Cartel president Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah was authorised to trigger consultations on a further 500,000 BPD increase within a matter of weeks, should prices stay high.

 But ministers offered scant hope they can force prices back below the $50 a barrel that Opec thinks the world needs to sustain the economic growth that fuels oil demand.

 Weve assessed the market and concluded that there is plentiful supply and the problem is with refining, said Saudi Arabias oil minister Ali al-Naimi.

 We have to prepare for the fourth quarter. Demands on Opec will increase to 30.5-31 (million BPD) and we have to prepare ourselves to continue increasing our production just to reach the call on Opec, said al-Sabah.

 Latest estimates from Opec are that it is pumping some 30 million BPD, including quota-exempt Iraq, near a 25-year supply high.

 Oil traders were not impressed. Prices rose, extending gains driven by worries over an Opec capacity crunch and refinery bottlenecks that are squeezing global petroleum product supplies. US crude added 51 cents to $55.51 a barrel. Dealers said the new deal merely legitimises existing output, leaving a tough test for hard-pressed producers ahead of the fourth quarter, when annual world demand peaks.

 Opec has been firing blanks for a while, said Glenn Murray, an oil broker based in Monaco. The fundamental problem is one of refining capacity. 

 Even at the most optimistic estimate the spare capacity of Opec is still too slim to reassure the market, said William Davie, chief economist at Simmons and Co.

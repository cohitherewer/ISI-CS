 IOC move irks shippers

 S. P. S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Feb. 17: Indian shipping companies are worried over Indian Oil Corporation?s (IOC) attempt to break free of the existing system of hiring ships through Transchart ? the chartering wing of the shipping ministry, which gives preference to Indian ships.

 Sources say the senior executives of companies such as Shipping Corporation of India, Great Eastern, Mercator, Varun and Essar have met Union shipping minister T. R. Baalu to express their fears that the IOC move would go against the interest of national shipping. 

 The Union cabinet had not cleared the IOC proposal forwarded by the petroleum ministry as the shipping ministry had expressed strong reservations on the issue. The cabinet had decided to refer the proposal to a committee of secretaries which will be meeting tomorrow to discuss the issue.

 IOC wants to make its own shipping arrangements for importing crude oil and petroleum products such as LPG. However, the shipping ministry is opposed to such a move on the grounds that the existing arrangement under Transchart, which gives the first choice of refusal for carrying national cargo to Indian vessels, has been working well.

 The shipping ministry has pointed out that the IOC move goes against the national shipping policy aimed at expanding the Indian merchant fleet. Allowing IOC to go in for its own shipping arrangements could also trigger similar demands from other public sector companies like SAIL, Bhel and NTPC. This would lead to the creation of chartering wings in each public sector enterprise for which more personnel would have to be hired to duplicate what is being done for all the companies under Transchart.

 The shipping ministry has also expressed the view that IOC does not have the requisite expertise to charter ships. Although IOC has claimed that it has a shipping division, the shipping ministry is reported to have pointed out that these officials do not have any chartering experience which is considered essential for hiring ships. Any fresh recruitment of staff for setting up a chartering wing would create more flab even as the government policy clearly states that incurring such extra cost on personnel should be avoided. 

 IOC, on its part, has been taking the stand that most of its crude comes on very large crude carriers (VLCCs) and there are not many such vessels with Indian shipping companies.

 However, shipping ministry officials say that Indian companies are expanding their fleet and some of them, including SCI, have already placed orders for new VLCCs. The loss of IOC cargo would come as a big blow to their expansion plans.

 ?The government has introduced the tonnage tax in the last budget in order to help Indian shipping companies expand their fleet and if assured cargo starts slipping out of their hands it would be a major setback,? a shipping ministry official said.

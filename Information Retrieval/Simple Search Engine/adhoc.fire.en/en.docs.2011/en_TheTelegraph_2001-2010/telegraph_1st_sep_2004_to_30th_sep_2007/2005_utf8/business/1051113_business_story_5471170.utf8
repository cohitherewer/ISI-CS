The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Oriental focus on aviation reinsurance 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 12: Oriental Insurance Company is keen on acquiring inward reinsurance business, particularly relating to the aviation and power sectors, from nearby Saarc countries and expects to achieve a business of $20 million in the current fiscal.

 Though we have been doing reinsurance business sporadically, we have decided to focus on it from the current fiscal itself. We believe we can double our business figures in the next fiscal, said M. Ramadoss, chairman and managing director, Oriental Insurance Company Limited.

 We are the biggest players in the power insurance sector and also a name to reckon with among aviation insurers in the country. We have developed the experience and expertise to reinsure the schemes in these sectors, Ramadoss said.

 He added: We are also contemplating to get ourselves rated by a foreign agency which would make us more credible to those countries. Apart from the Saarc countries, we will also explore such opportunities in other Asian countries. 

 The state-owned insurer is targeting a premium income of Rs 3,500 crore during the current financial year compared with Rs 3,000 crore achieved in the last fiscal.

 We have prepared the internal road map for entering the de-tariffing regime and are collating all our data together. Such pricing would be more relevant to proper underwriting rather than market forces, Ramadoss explained.

 The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda) has recently allowed life insurance companies to sell non-life products. In accordance with these guidelines, we are in talks with some major life insurance companies to sell our products, he mentioned.

 Oriental Insurance has also entered into an agreement with the postal department for distributing its products across the country, which gives the company access to 1.5 lakh post offices spread over the country.

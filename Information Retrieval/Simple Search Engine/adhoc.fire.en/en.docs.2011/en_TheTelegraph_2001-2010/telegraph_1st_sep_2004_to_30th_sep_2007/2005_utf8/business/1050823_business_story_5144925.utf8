 TUI offers $2 bn for Canadian CP Ships

 Berlin, Aug. 22 (Reuters): German travel operator TUI said on Sunday it had made a $2 billion cash offer for Canadian container shipping company CP Ships Ltd and would launch a rights issue of about 1 billion euros ($1.21 billion) to help fund the purchase.

 TUI said the acquisition would accelerate the growth of Hapag-Lloyd, TUIs container shipping business. The combined company would be a top five player, based on capacity, and increase Hapag-Lloyds attractiveness to partners in alliances.

 TUI said its offer amounted to $21.50 per CP Ships share, a premium of 9.7 per cent on Fridays closing price, and that the board of the Canadian company had recommended that shareholders accept it.

 TUI said its rights issue would reduce the need to use bank financing for the transaction, which it expected to conclude in the fourth quarter of this year.

 Hapag-Lloyd would see synergy benefits of about 180 million euros per year by the third full year following the acquisition, while TUI envisaged integration costs amounting to about 100 million euros, mostly occurring during 2006.

 TUI expects the acquisition, including the intended rights issue, to be earnings-per-share-enhancing at least post-integration, which is expected for 2008,: TUI said.

 The combined group currently operates 139 ships on over 100 routes. The deal would offer stronger coverage in the Far Eastern, Australasian and South American trade lanes, TUI said.

 Yuletide arrives early in market

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 9: Dalal Street is celebrating Christmas early this year. Today the key market index scaled a new closing peak of 9,067.28 points, up 161 points or 1.81 per cent.

 The government?s positive economic growth outlook and court approval for Reliance?s demerger scheme made the day for investors.

 Heavy purchases by foreign funds and hectic short- covering by operators drove the Bombay Stock Exchange?s 30-share index to an all-time intra-trade high of 9,080.76, before it settled at 9,067.28 against Thursday?s close of 8,906.31.

 The sensex topped its earlier intra-day life-time high of 9057.97, touched on December 2, and closed above 9,000 for the first time.

 Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were aggressive buyers today. Operators and retail investors soon joined the bandwagon.

 RIL, REL and Reliance Capital saw active trading after the demerger scheme was cleared. 

 Other key counters like Infosys, ONGC, L amp;T, TCS, Bajaj Auto, Bhel, ICICI Bank, SBI, Maruti Udyog, Hero Honda, Grasim, Tata Motors and Bharti Tele-Ventures recorded sharp gains.

 The broad-based BSE-100 soared 70.91 points to 4790.63 from the previous close of 4719.72.

 The BSE-200 and the Dollex-200 were quoted sharply higher at 1148.48 and 413.70 at close compared with their previous close of 1132.30 and 406.90, respectively. The BSE-500 index shot up by 53.86 points to 3682.11 from Thursday?s close of 3628.25 and the Dollex-30 ended higher at 1610.61 from 1578.26.

 The volume of business rose sharply to Rs 4315.92 crore from Rs 3372.74 crore yesterday.

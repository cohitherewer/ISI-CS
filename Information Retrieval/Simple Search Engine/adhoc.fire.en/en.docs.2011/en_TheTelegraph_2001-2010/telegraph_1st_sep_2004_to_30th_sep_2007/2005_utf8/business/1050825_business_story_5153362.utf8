 Bengal sees cash in unused CIL land

 Calcutta, Aug. 24: The Bengal government is negotiating with Coal India Limited (CIL) to explore ways to utilise the unused land of open cast mines in the Asansol belt. 

 ?There is a vast stretch of land under Eastern Coalfields Limited (ECL), which is lying unutilised. It had open cast mines from which coal has been extracted. We are talking to ECL, a subsidiary of CIL, for proper utilisation of the land,? state commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen said to the members of the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BNCCI).

 ?The coal authorities have agreed to use certain pockets of land. For others, negotiations are still on,? he added.

 Acquiring land for industries has emerged as a controversial issue in the Bengal government.

 Sen, however, said there is a wrong impression that only fertile land is being acquired for industrialisation. ?On the contrary, we are acquiring under-utilised and fallow lands in certain districts, which will be used for industries. It is not true that agricultural land is being used for industrialisation in all cases.?

 He said the state government?s motto is to gradually reduce the burden on agriculture and focus on industrialisation. ?Unless we do that, the state cannot develop. Globally, it is evident that no development has taken place without industrialisation,? he added.

 The government wants to provide land for industries as soon as possible. West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) is directly purchasing land from the farmers, the minister said.

 ?WBIDC has purchased nearly 300 acres at Ranihati where the foundry park is coming up. The entrepreneurs are buying the land directly from WBIDC,? he said. The total area for the foundry park is 1,000 acres.

 Regarding the chemical hub at Haldia, the minister said that a consultant ? Mott McDonald ? has been appointed to carry out a detailed report on the project.

 The chemical hub will come up on 10,000 acres. It is learnt that Reliance and the Hindujas have already evinced interest to set up projects in the chemical hub.

 Sen, however, refused to divulge names. ?Many well-known companies and groups are interested in the project,? he said.

 He said WBIDC will soon enter into an agreement with IIT Kharagpur for the state?s proposed biotechnology park. IIT Kharagpur will provide knowledge-based concepts to the biotech park.

 HPL issue

 Sen today termed the turn of events in Haldia Petrochemicals Limited as ?unfortunate?. Purnendu Chatterjee, the NRI promoter of HPL, has moved the company law board against the government?s decision to issue shares to IOC. Sen refused to comment further but added that the legal wrangles will not affect the performance of HPL in anyway.

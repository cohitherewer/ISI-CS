 Investors on a roll as IPO bets pay off

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Calcutta, Aug. 14: The craze for initial public offerings (IPO) does not appear to have been unfounded. As many as 27 IPOs have hit the market so far in this calendar year. Of these, 23 have delivered returns ranging from 11 per cent to almost 300 per cent and two around 6 per cent; only two offers are in the red.

 Investors have raked in more than double the moolah spent. The issues of Nandam Exim, Gateway Distriparks, Vishal Exports, Shree Ganesh Forgings and Cyber Media are examples.

 IL amp;FS Investsmart, Beeyu Overseas, Shringar Cinema, Yes Bank and Shoppers Stop have appreciated by more than 50 per cent. The share prices of Provogue, Gokaldas Export, Mangalam Drugs, Allsec Technologies, 3I Infotech and UTV Software have risen over 20 per cent from their offer rates.

 The IPOs have given better returns than benchmark indices, with sensex gaining 17 per cent and S amp;P CNX Nifty 13 per cent in this calendar year. Topping the gainers list is Nandan Exim with an increase of 281.5 per cent. On August 12, the stock closed at Rs 76.3 against its issue price of Rs 20. Gateway Distriparks gained 181.11 per cent to Rs 202.4 against its issue price of Rs 72.

 Another big-bang opening was that of IDFC, which closed at Rs 69.5 on Friday, a gain of 104.41 per cent on its issue price of Rs 34.

 Shringar Cinema, the film distribution company, is commanding a premium of 63 per cent at Rs 86.4 per cent against its issue price of Rs 53. 

 Yes Bank, which raised Rs 315 crore in July, is trading at Rs 70.70 on the National Stock Exchange, up 57.11 per cent from the issue price of Rs 45. 

 Shoppers Stop is quoting at Rs 386.75, 62.5 per cent higher than its issue price of Rs 238, while Provogue is hovering at Rs 188.25, a premium of 25.5 per cent over its issue price of Rs 150.

 The two laggards are Jaiprakash Hydropower and Jindal Polyfims, the prices of which hover at Rs 30.45 and Rs 344.6 respectively against the offer rates of Rs 32 and Rs 344.

 The appetite for such issues seem to be unabated as the HT Media IPO, which closed on Wednesday, has been oversubscribed 20.86 times. The issue comprised 69.95 lakh shares.

 The IPO of Sasken Communication Technologies also received an overwhelming response when it opened on Thursday, with an oversubscription of eight times within a few hours.

 Debt mop-up

 Fund mobilisation through bonds of above one-year tenor by companies and institutions has gone up by 23 per cent to Rs 11,979 crore during the first quarter of this fiscal compared with Rs 9,710 crore a year ago, said PTI.

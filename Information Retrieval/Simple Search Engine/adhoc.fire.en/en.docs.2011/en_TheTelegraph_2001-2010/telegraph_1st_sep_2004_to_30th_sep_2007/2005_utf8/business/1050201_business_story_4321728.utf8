 Cellular long calls cheaper from today

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 31: The STD and ISD calls for more than 3.73 crore mobile customers will cost less from tomorrow, with the new rates taking effect from the midnight of February 1.

 All major operators, AirTel, Hutch, Idea, Reliance and Tata Indicom have slashed the ISD rates by Rs 1.75 per minute and STD tariffs by 35 paise per minute. 

 Both pre-paid and post-paid subscribers will pay lower rates. Mobile subscribers will get this benefit irrespective of the tariff plan they have opted for.

 The cut in rates has been effected by the operators following the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India?s (Trai) decision to reduce access deficit charges (ADC) by 20 paise per minute for calls between 50 kms and 200 kms and 50 paise per minute for calls beyond 200 kms.

 The ADC is a fee that telecom operators pay to fund players who offer telecom services in rural and inaccessible areas where revenue earnings do not cover costs.

 Manoj Kohli, president (mobility) of Bharti Tele-Ventures, said, ?We believe this will fuel new acquisitions and also spur usage.?

 Trai had cut the ADC rates on January 6 and said that new rates would take effect on February 1. 

 However, there was an apprehension that customers may not get to avail this benefit from February since Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd, the telecom operator in Delhi and Mumbai, had approached the Telecom Dispute Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) against the Trai order to cut the ADC and sought a stay. 

 The levy, MTNL alleged, could result in a loss of about Rs 550 crore for the company. 

 However, TDSAT today refused to grant a stay, through an interim order, on the implementation of the new ADC regime from Tuesday.

 Trai has said these ADC rates would be reviewed within three to six months of its implementation on the basis of the increase in volume of calls and subscribers and other details.

 The regulator expects the new regime to be followed by a competitive market response resulting in a reduction in call charges. It will monitor the tariffs through the special software that it is developing for comparison of tariff packages.

 Trai is of the opinion that the tariff cuts are substantial and would help in spreading the use of mobile phones in the country. 

 Trai member D. P. S. Seth said compared to the mobile subscriber base considered by the regulator for fixing the ADC in October 2003, the increase in subscribers was 100 per cent by September 2004 and is likely to be about 230 per cent by September 2005.

 Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited, the main beneficiary of the ADC, has claimed that it will lose about Rs 1,254, crore annually due to the reduction in charges.

 However, this has been contested by the Trai. 

 ?It is possible to collect a given ADC amount with a lower charge per minute since the volume of calls and subscribers will have an exponential growth, quot; the regulator said.

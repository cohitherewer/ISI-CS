 Calcutta, May 26: Bengal today turned down the Planning Commission?s proposal to introduce flexible labour laws to attract foreign investments.

 Rigidity in labour laws is an impediment to industrial development in India, said Anwarul Hoda, member of the Planning Commission. 

 ?The Commission and the central government are trying to reach a political consensus on the issue. Foreign companies setting up shop here want to know about the exit policy of the government,? Hoda said at a seminar organised by Ficci here.

 However, the worker-friendly Bengal government made it clear that there is no consensus on this issue.

 Bengal commerce minister Nirupam Sen was quick to turn down the proposal.

 ?Before introducing flexible labour reforms, it should be kept in mind that there is no social security system in our country. Unemployment is a major problem. The pace of industrial development is not enough to address the unemployment in our country,? he said.

 Sen said the state government was not in favour of allowing arbitrary retrenchment for rapid industrialisation. 

 ?Our employees are often accused of going on strikes. But why do employees of IBM and BBC stop work to protest retrenchment even though their countries provide social security?? questioned Sen.

 Hoda, on his part, pointed to the other roadblock to industrialisation ? lack of infrastructure namely ports, airports, roads and railways.

 ?China has invested $30 billion in roads whereas India has invested only $3 billion,? he said.

 The panel is planning a freight corridor that will join Mumbai, Delhi and Calcutta for faster movement of goods, Hoda said.

 According to the Planning Commission, the other stumbling blocks for the growth of industry are high indirect tax, import duty and entry and exit barriers.

 Sen rooted for a national policy on minerals. ?Even though Bengal has the highest reserves of coal, it has no control over it. However, states with iron ore reserves have control on it. There is no level playing ground for the states,? he said.

 The Jindals, who have submitted a proposal to the Bengal government for a greenfield steel plant, cannot proceed with the project as the Jharkhand government is not willing to provide iron ore linkage to them, he added.

 Air ambulance

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 18: Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre (EHIRC) and Deccan Aviation, which operates the budget carrier Air Deccan, today launched the countrys first flying intensive care service designed to ferry patients in life-threatening cardiac shock.

 Air Rescue One is the countrys first dedicated air ambulance that is equipped to deliver critical care to patients even at 10,000 ft in the sky.

 We feel that this air ambulance service will help save many lives. It will also help bridge the metro and semi-urban or rural divide by giving a world-class treatment to the needy, said Naresh Trehan, executive director, EHIRC.

 While Deccan Aviation will provide eight helicopters and two fixed-wing aircraft, besides full logistics and ground support, EHIRC will be responsible for total medical rescue operation and equipment.

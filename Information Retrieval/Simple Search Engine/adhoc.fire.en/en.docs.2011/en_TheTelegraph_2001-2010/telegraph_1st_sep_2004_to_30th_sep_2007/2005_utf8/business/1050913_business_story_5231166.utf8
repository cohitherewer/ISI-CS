 eBay to buy Skype

 San Francisco, Sept. 12 (Reuters): eBay Inc has agreed to buy the fast-growing Internet start-up, Skype, in a move to add free voice calls to its online auctions and fuel growth, a source close to the situation said on Monday.

 eBay plans to pay $1.3 billion in cash and $1.3 billion in stock for the Internet telephone company and to make a further payout of up to $1.5 billion by 2008 or 2009 if financial targets are met, giving the deal a total value of up to $4.1 billion, the source said.

 eBay is renowned for an Internet business model linking millions of buyers and sellers, but its core US market is maturing.

 Skypes revenues are estimated to be only about 50 million to 70 million euros, but it has raced to the lead in the booming voice-over-Internet (VOIP) market, which is being aggressively targeted by online powerhouses such as Yahoo, Google and Microsoft.

 In just two years, Skype has attracted 54 million members to its free Internet-based voice service and is on pace to roughly double in size within a year.

 Spokesmen for eBay and Skype declined to comment. The eBay investor relations site contained a notice of a conference call scheduled for Monday, but provided no details on the nature of the Webcast.

 Skype, whose software allows consumers to make free or low-cost phone calls anywhere in the world via the Internet, would be the biggest acquisition so far for 10-year-old eBay.

 It tops the $1.5 billion eBay paid in 2002 for PayPal, which thrust eBay into the lead in the online-payment market. 

 This year PayPal is on track to become a $1-billion business.

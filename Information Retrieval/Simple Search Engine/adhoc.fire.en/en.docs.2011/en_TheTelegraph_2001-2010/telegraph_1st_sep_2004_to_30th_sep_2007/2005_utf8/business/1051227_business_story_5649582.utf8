 States resist mergers into SAIL stable

 New Delhi, Dec. 26: Steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan today admitted that his plans of creating an Indian steel-making giant, which would figure among top global steel makers, have hit regional snags.

 ?We have to keep states? interests in mind ... Andhra Pradesh does not want Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (also called Vizag Steel) to be merged with the Steel Authority of India (SAIL) as it feels supply of steel in the state may suffer,? he said. 

 ?At the same time, other smaller PSUs like Manganese Ore and Iron (MOIL) does not want to be merged with SAIL. Even Vizag Steel does not want the merger,? Paswan said.

 The Andhra Pradesh government has made representations to the Centre to voice its concerns about the fate of Vizag Steel if it is merged with SAIL, sources said. The top brass of Vizag Steel has been inciting trade unions and politicians to oppose the move, they added.

 However, officials said the Centre will try to convince the state government that such a merger will be beneficial to Vizag Steel in the long run, given the cyclical nature of the industry. ?The next steel price meltdown will again see standalone steel plants going under ... world over we have seen that only huge chains of steel mills are able to survive the cyclical ups and downs of this industry. The days of pricing controls and duty walls are over, we are open to the global markets ... we have to plan ahead to keep our steel industry intact before the next downswing in this industry,? Paswan said.

 Steel prices generally move in a cyclical fashion on a global scale every five to seven years. Many standalone steel mills in Europe, the US and elsewhere had to either shut shop or were taken over by other companies the last time the prices dipped. Steel magnate L.N. Mittal then bought cheap such mills.

 The new entity, if created, would have a combined crude production capacity of 16.2 mt or higher than Thyssen Krupp of Germany.

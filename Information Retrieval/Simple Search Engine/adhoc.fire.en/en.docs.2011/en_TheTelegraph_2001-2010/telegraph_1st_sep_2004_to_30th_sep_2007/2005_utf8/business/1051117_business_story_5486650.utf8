 Calcutta, Nov. 16: Quite a few domestic and international companies have shown interest in developing a greenfield airport in Calcutta. This will be in addition to the existing one at Dum Dum.

 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is keen on developing a new facility as the old one is fast reaching full capacity.

 The state needs the new airport on a long-term basis, Nilotpal Basu, member of Rajya Sabha and chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on transport and tourism, said.

 He said the Left Front is in favour of allowing FDI in greenfield airport development. The present regulation allows 49 per cent FDI in airports.

 It could be in the joint sector or fully private. The Left parties are not opposed to it, Basu added.

 He was speaking on the sidelines of an interactive session organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) here today.

 A new international airport will require at least 1,200 acres. 

 Bengal commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen said his department has already set the ball rolling for the appointment of a consultant.

 I have told my department to work on it. Hopefully, a global tender would be floated by the end of this financial year, Sen told The Telegraph.

 The consultant will identify the location and draw up a detailed feasibility report. The commercial viability has to be established as well as the likely impact on the existing airport.

 Ideally, the new airport should come up close to the existing one, Sabyasachi Sen, principal secretary, commerce and industry, government of Bengal, said.

 Even as the project is at a conceptual stage, he expressed hope that the new airport would be a viable one and there will be interest among investors.

 In the meantime, the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Airport at Dum Dum is expecting a fresh lease of life by the way of a new international terminal.

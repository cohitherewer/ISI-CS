 Airlines sign no-poaching agreement

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Flying rules

 New Delhi, April 19: Airlines operating out of the country today agreed to adopt a code that forces them to refuse jobs to pilots and engineers who have not given a minimum four-month notice to their previous employers.

 The ?no poaching pact?, as it is being loosely labelled, is also likely to set a cap on pilot and engineer emoluments to stop airlines from splurging to woo away scarce trained manpower from each other.

 Most airlines seemed willing to accept the pay and allowances offered by state-run airlines as the ceiling for pilots and engineers. 

 Civil aviation secretary Ajay Prasad, top officials of Jet, Sahara, Indian Airlines, Air-India, Kingfisher, Spice jet and Deccan Air were among those who met today to finalise the deal. 

 Prasad told reporters that airlines have agreed not to poach on each other in a manner which ?disrupts the operations and schedules of others?.

 ?The new deal is based on self-regulation. The best way to solve this problem is for the airlines to agree on a certain code of behaviour. This is the beginning of that process,? the civil aviation secretary said.

 After four rounds of discussions, it was also agreed that information regarding pay-scales and emoluments of pilots be shared between the airlines and ?a parity maintained in their salary structures?.

 The officials also agreed to have a four-month notice period for pilots and decided to fix similar time-frames for other sections of operational staffers, he said.

 He acknowledged that pilots choosing to go to greener pastures cannot be stopped. ?However, our request has been that nothing should be done which affects the operations of the airlines quot;.

 Maintaining that todays decisions were ?unanimous?, Prasad said several other issues remained to be discussed and that more such meetings should be convened to resolve the problems.

 At the meeting, Indian Airlines and Air-India stressed the need for a cap on salaries drawn by pilots. 

 Indian Airlines, for one, pointed out that its operations in the Northeast had been seriously affected when a large number of pilots quit their jobs to join private carriers.

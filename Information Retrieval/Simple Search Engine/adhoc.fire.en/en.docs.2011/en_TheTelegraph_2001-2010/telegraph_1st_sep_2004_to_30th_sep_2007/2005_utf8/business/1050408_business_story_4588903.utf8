 Indian Oil tops Asian chart

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 7: Indian Oil Corporation has pipped Chinas Sinopec and Malaysias Petronas to emerge as the top company in oil trading among state-owned companies in the Asia Pacific region.

 Petronas, Sinopec, Hindustan Petroleum and ENOC of United Arab Emirates have been included among the top five companies of the region. 

 The list has been drawn up through the annual survey conducted by Applied Trading Systems of Singapore for the year 2004. IOC has emerged as the leading company for the second year in succession. It has imported almost 32 million tonnes of crude oil and over three million tonnes of petroleum products while exporting over one million tonnes of products. IOC plans to import 40 million tonnes of crude oil during 2005-06. 

 IOC claims to have initiated over the years a series of measures to benchmark its trading systems with international best practices. The company had started derivative trading for the first time during 2004 to mitigate risks arising due to volatility in crude prices.

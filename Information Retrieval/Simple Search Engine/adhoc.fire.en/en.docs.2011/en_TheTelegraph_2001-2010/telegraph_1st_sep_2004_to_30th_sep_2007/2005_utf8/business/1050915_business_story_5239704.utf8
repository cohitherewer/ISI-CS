 Change in GDR rules to help India Inc

 New Delhi, Sept. 14 (PTI): The government, which had tightened the norms for overseas listing on August 31, today provided some relief to Indian companies that filed for GDR and FCCB issues by last month.

 In a statement, the finance ministry today said unlisted companies, which had filed for overseas issues before August 31, would be exempted from prior or simultaneous listing of their shares in the domestic market. However, these companies have to list their shares on local exchanges by December 2005.

 For the listed companies, the revised pricing guidelines will not apply if they had filed for overseas issues by last month.

 The listed companies have to come out with their overseas issues by December 31, 2005. Both listed and unlisted companies will get the exemptions if they have undertaken verifiable effective steps for overseas listing.

 The exemption from the stringent GDR/FCCB norms will be applicable to companies which had completed due diligence and filed offering circular in the overseas market.

 It will also be applicable to companies, which have obtained approval from overseas exchanges or paid the listing fees or obtained RBI approval for meeting issue-related expenses.

 The ministry also clarified that private placement of issues, where no offering circular was placed before the overseas exchanges, would not qualify for the exemptions.

 All other conditions, including eligibility of issuer and eligibility of subscriber, will still be applicable to all companies. 

 Though the GDR/FCCB norms were relaxed a bit, an Indian company barred by Sebi from raising funds in domestic capital market, will not be eligible to issue FCCBs or ordinary shares through GDRs. Tainted overseas corporate bodies will not be eligible to subscribe to FCCBs and GDRs.

 The relaxation of the GDR/FCCB norms comes after a request from local companies, which took up the matter with the finance ministry soon after it tightened the norms last month.

 India Inc had requested the ministry to exempt companies which have taken verifiable effective steps before August 31 and incurred costs needed for overseas listing of their global depositories receipts and foreign currency convertible bonds.

 The government had tightened foreign currency convertible bonds and ordinary shares (through depositary receipt mechanism) scheme under the ADR/GDR guidelines to ensure companies with sound track record tap the overseas market.

 It had also barred tainted companies to subscribe GDR and FCCB bonds of Indian companies.

 The finance ministry amended the FCCB/GDR norms so as to align it with Sebis guidelines on domestic capital issues.

 Necessary modifications had been carried out in the scheme for issue of FCCBs and ordinary shares (through depository receipt mechanism) scheme, which was issued for the first time in November 1993.

 Calcutta, June 25: Textile manufacturer SPL Industries Ltd has kicked off a Rs 41-crore expansion drive to reap the benefits of quota-free regime. The company will tap the capital market with an initial public offer to raise the fund earmarked for the expansion programme. 

 The IPO will open on June 29 and the company has set the price band for the issue between at Rs 60-70 per share. The Delhi-based firm is issuing 90,00,000 equity shares to raise between Rs 54 to 63 crore.

 SPL Industries, which exports 90 per cent of its produce, knitted cotton garments, will increase capacity by 40 per cent. It presently has five separate manufacturing units, all located in Faridabad near Delhi. 

 The company expects over 50 per cent growth in the sales during the current financial year with the expanded capacity. Moreover, company?s profit margin is also expected to improve going by the trend witnessed in the first three month of 2005.

 The quota has been lifted from the Indian textile exports from January 1 this year, giving a great opportunity for Indian companies.

 ?All our capacities are booked. This is very exciting time for us,? said Vijay Jindal, deputy managing director of SPL Industries Ltd. The company exports to the US and supplies to major retailers such as Gap, J C Penny, Kohl?s, Haggers, Sears PVH.

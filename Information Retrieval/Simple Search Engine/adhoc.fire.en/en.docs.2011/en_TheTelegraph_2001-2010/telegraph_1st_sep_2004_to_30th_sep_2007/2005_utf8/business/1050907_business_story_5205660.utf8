 Calcutta, Sept. 6: Intrex India has set its sights on a turnover of Rs 500 crore during the current fiscal, of which Rs 350 crore will come from the sales of its pre-paid Itz cash card.

 The Itz card makes transactions on the Internet easier for those who dont possess a credit or debit card or are wary of giving their card details on the net.

 The user can also use multiple cards of various denominations or transfer balance funds from one card to another.

 The Essel group company already has tie-ups with Indiatimes, Rediff, IRCTC (for online railway ticket booking), Dish TV and Playwin.

 Reliance pre-paid mobile users will also be able to recharge their account using the Itz card either by sending an SMS or through any of the 4000 Playwin online lottery terminals. Users can also recharge through the Intrex website.

 E-refill is a step towards offering the user the freedom of recharging according to convenience, said Naveen Surya, executive director, Intrex India. We have also tied up with AirTel for the Mumbai circle.

 The companys focus will be on making payments for utility services like water and electricity. Reliance Energy has already entered into an arrangement with Intrex. We are in talks with other companies for a tie-up, said Surya. Besides utility services, we are also speaking to airline companies to facilitate online bookings through Itz.

 Manwani to succeed Banga

 Manwani: Ready for action

 Mumbai, May 2: Unilever president (Asia amp; Africa) Harish Manwani will succeed M. S. Banga as the non-executive chairman of Hindustan Lever Ltd (HLL).

 ?The board intends to elect Harish Manwani as the non-executive chairman of the company to succeed M. S. Banga after the annual general meeting on June 24,? the company informed the Bombay Stock Exchange today.

 The board, at its meeting on April 29, decided to co-opt Manwani as an additional director. Banga will not seek re-election as a non-executive director at the AGM.

 ?After he became president (foods) of Unilever, M. S. Banga had said he would not seek re-election as a non-executive director at the AGM scheduled for June 24,? the company said.

 ?In these last few years, we have strengthened the company by focusing on our 35 power brands. We have improved quality and affordability,? Banga said.

 ?We have also built our core functional capabilities and created a more agile and consumer-connected company. We now have a vibrant and energised team that is confident of growing with India,? he said.

 The appointment of Manwani as the non-executive chairman will, however, not bring about any change in the current HLL national management committee that comprises M. K. Sharma, D. Sundaram, Arun Adhikari and S. Ravindranath.

 The national management committee is responsible for HLL?s performance and the overall co-ordination of the divisional structure and corporate functions.

 ?I feel privileged to be serving HLL as the non-executive chairman. While there may be competitive challenges, HLL is strongly placed to overcome these and will continue to play a significant role to serve the needs of Indian consumers,? Banga said.

 Analysts tracking the over Rs 10,000-crore FMCG major preferred to reserve their comments on Manwani. ?We dont know the man enough,? said Harrish Zaveri of Edelweiss Capital. 

 HLL sources talk of Manwanis gift of the gab and strong inter-personal skills that could help bond HLL employees and distributors and raise their morale.

 On the bourses today, the proposed change of guard could not infuse enough confidence. The stock surrendered 3.44 per cent from Friday?s close of Rs 137.70 to Rs 133.05.

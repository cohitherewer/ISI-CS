 Qualcomm rejects antitrust claims

 New York, July 6 (Reuters): Qualcomm Inc said on Wednesday that its practices for selling technology licences are lawful and favour competition following an antitrust lawsuit brought against it from rival Broadcom Corp.

 Wireless technology firm Qualcomm said communications chip maker Broadcoms decision to take legal actions rather than negotiating with Qualcomm means that Qualcomm will have to proceed with litigation of its own.

 Broadcom said on Tuesday that it was filing an antitrust suit against Qualcomm, arguing that it was unfairly using its technology licensing business to help sell its chips for high-speed wireless phones.

 Qualcomm rejected the charges in a statement, saying its licensing practices are lawful, fair, reasonable and pro-competitive.

 The antitrust lawsuit, which was filed in the US District Court for the district of New Jersey, follows patent infringement and fair trade complaints made by Broadcom against Qualcomm that were disclosed in May.

 This case, like the earlier patent cases filed by Broadcom against Qualcomm, appears to be a desperate attempt by Broadcom to gain bargaining leverage through meritless litigation, said Qualcomm senior vice-president and general counsel Louis Lupin.

 Qualcomm recently resolved legal battles with technology license customers Texas Instruments Inc and Skyworks Solutions.

 Payoff slur sticks to Xerox Modicorp

 New Delhi, Jan. 23 (PTI): A high-level government probe has found Xerox Modicorp guilty of making ?improper payments? to procure orders from the government and private firms. It has proposed the formation of an inter-agency group, which will include the CBI, to decide on the action.

 The investigation against the company was ordered in 2002 after Xerox Inc admitted in a submission to the US Securities and Exchange Commission that its Indian subsidiary had made ?improper payments? to get government orders valued around Rs 3-3.5 crore.

 The investigation found that the Indian subsidiary, including its directors at that time, prima facie violated various provisions of the Companies Act, including Section 211. 

 ?This provision requires firms to show true and fair view of the profit-and-loss account and the state of affairs during the relevant financial years,? sources in the department of company affairs said.

 ?The government is in the process of forming an inter-departmental group, comprising various departments and agencies like revenue, CBI and law, to determine the course of action in respect of the violations,? they said.

 The probe found that the company had engaged in ?illegal gratification? of officials and corrupt practices to procure orders from government departments and entities. In doing so, it violated the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, they said.

 The panel also concluded that the company and its officials engaged in deliberate destruction of evidences in violation of the provisions of the Indian Penal Code.

 Other offences include evasion of income tax, criminal conspiracy and aiding and abetting commission of offences.

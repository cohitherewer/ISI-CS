 Nalco stake sale runs into a wall

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Dec. 28: The finance ministrys proposal to offload a small part of the governments equity in National Aluminium Company has been rejected by the ministry of mines.

 The ministry has rejected the proposal to offload 5 per cent in Nalco, sources said.

 The finance ministry had written to the ministry of mines seeking its view on how Nalco would benefit if 5 per cent of the governments holding in the company was offloaded in the market.

 To build the corpus of the National Investment Fund, the finance ministry had also written to the coal ministry seeking its views on selling 15 per cent of the governments holding in Neyveli Lignite Corporation.

 The coal ministry, however, is yet to take a view on the matter. The government holds 93.56 per cent in Neyveli Lignite and the sale of 15 per cent is likely to fetch it around Rs 1,800 crore.

 Earlier, the finance ministry had mooted a proposal to off-load 10 per cent in Nalco in the domestic market.

 The mines ministry had, however, resisted the move saying the shares should be listed abroad as the company is planning to expand outside India.

 The overseas listing will give the company an international profile that will help it mobilise resources abroad to fund expansion plans. The sale of 5 per cent shares in Nalco would have fetched the government around Rs 700 crore and reduced its stake in the company to 82.15 per cent.

 Bharti-IBM pact for ICT services

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: Bharti Tele-Ventures and IBM India will jointly offer value-based services in communications, information technology services and convergence. The two companies today announced the launch of managed services under a Joint Go-To-Market programme targeted at enterprise customers.

 Within hours of forging the alliance, the companies secured their first major contract from the income tax department. They will connect the offices of the department.

 The first office will be inaugurated by Union finance minister P. Chidambaram by the month end. 

 While Bharti will provide the telecommunications infrastructure and lead sales engagements, IBM will provide the IT infrastructure and technology management services to clients. 

 The business initiative was mooted last year when Bharti Tele-Ventures outsourced all its IT-related services from IBM for $750 million over a 10-year period.

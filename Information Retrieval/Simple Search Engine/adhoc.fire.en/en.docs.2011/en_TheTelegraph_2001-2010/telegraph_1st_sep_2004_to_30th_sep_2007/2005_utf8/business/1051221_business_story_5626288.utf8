 Calcutta, Dec. 20: The Kyrgyz Republic has invited Indian oil and gas companies to invest in exploration there.

 A high-level delegation from the former Soviet Union republic will shortly visit India to hold talks with the petroleum ministry officials.

 We will apprise the opportunity in our country and invite Indian companies to conduct exploration, a Kyrgyz embassy official said in Calcutta today.

 The country boasts of significant oil and gas reserves yet to be exploited.

 According to the Kyrgyz government estimates, the reserves would be in the range of 32.9 billion cubic meters.

 Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is already present in Russias Shakhalin block. It is also eyeing assets in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. 

 Saktanbek Kadyraliev, Charge d Affaires of Kyrgyz Republic in India, said since the neighbouring countries have huge oil and gas reserves, it is but natural for Kyrgyzstan to also have similar reserves.

 The country will send another delegation shortly to explore opportunities in railways and telecom. It is a mountainous country that needs to develop infrastructure like railways and is seeking investment in this field.

 Moreover, the country is rich in mineral deposits like gold, iron ore, copper, marble and others.

 Kadyraliev invited Indian companies to invest in the mineral sector as well. 

 Tourism is a big business there with almost a million tourists visiting during the summer. 

 Kyrgyzstans Lake Issk-Kul is the second largest alpine lake in the world and is a centre of tourist attraction.

 We want the Indian hospitality industry to develop the tourist infrastructure there, he said at an interactive meeting with the Confederation of Indian Industry, eastern region.

 Two-way trade between India and the Kyrgyz Republic is very small, although it holds significant potential. Chinese firms have seized the opportunity in that country. Indians should come forward now, he added.

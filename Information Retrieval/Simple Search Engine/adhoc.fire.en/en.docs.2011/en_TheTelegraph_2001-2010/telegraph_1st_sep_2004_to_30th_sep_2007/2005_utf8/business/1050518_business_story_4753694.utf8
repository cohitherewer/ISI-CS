 New Delhi, May 17: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the government would aggressively push ahead with financial sector reforms and he hopes to wrap up the relevant legislative business within the first half of this financial year.

 Our policy-making is more or less complete in the areas of manufacturing, trade, services and taxation. But we are still in the process of framing policies in the financial sector, specifically banking, insurance, pension and capital markets, Chidambaram told industrialists at the two-day national conference of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 Once the policy matrix is complete, we must back it with legislation in the first half of this fiscal so that we can move forward with confidence, the finance minister added.

 Last week, Chidambaram had moved bills on banking sector reforms that were immediately referred to the parliamentary standing committee on finance. 

 The bill seeking the creation of the pension regulator was moved in January and is already before the committee. The government has indicated that it intends to raise the foreign direct investment cap in the insurance sector to 49 per cent from the current level of 26 per cent, but the relevant legislation has yet to come before Parliament. 

 Chidambaram said there was a need for dialogue at all levels ? among political parties, industry and other stakeholders ? before the policies in these areas could be crafted. We have to focus on dialogue and persuasion, he added. I seek your (India Incs) support in preparing policies in these areas.

 Chidambaram added that the government would need to constantly review the policies on foreign direct investment (FDI), foreign institutional investments, service exports, external commercial borrowings (ECBs) and remittances from abroad.

 We need to open our doors to foreign investment, ECBs, tourism earnings and other invisibles, he added.

 The finance minister expressed some frustration with the legislative gridlock in Parliament, where all proceedings have been stalled because of the Oppositions non-cooperation. I am not indulging in any finger-pointing, but the situation is clearly untenable, he said.

 He said there were several hurdles to the achievement of a double digit inclusive growth ? the theme of the CII conclave.

 He said these hurdles arose from a set of six deficits: fiscal, revenue, trade, investment, policy and governance.

 He said the revenue deficit would be phased out in a space of five years but it would crucially depend on the governments ability to ratchet up revenues. Expenditure control is a way out; but the key is increasing revenues.

 He said contrary to popular perception, India wasnt among the highest-taxed countries.

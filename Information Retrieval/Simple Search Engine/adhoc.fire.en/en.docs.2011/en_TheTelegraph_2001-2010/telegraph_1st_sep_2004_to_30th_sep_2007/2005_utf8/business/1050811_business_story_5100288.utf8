 Gail awaits Dabhol nod

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Aug. 10: The petroleum ministry will seek the approval of the cabinet committee on economic affairs tomorrow for Gails investment in Ratnagiri Gas and Power ? the new company being floated to revive the Dabhol power plant. Gail plans to invest Rs 500 crore to pick up a 28 per cent stake in the company.

 Ratnagiri Gas and Power will be spearheaded by Gail and NTPC with a 28 per cent stake each. The other partner ? Maharashtra State Electricity Board ? will have a 15 per cent share.

 The remaining 28 per cent stake will be picked up by an IDBI-led consortium of financial institutions. The major stake holders will invest Rs 500 crore each.

 Gail will take care of liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply for the project and set up an import terminal to bring in the gas, while NTPC will run the plant. Gail is confident of arranging the LNG supply by mid-2006, when the plant is likely to start generating power. 

 Gail plans to import 5 million tonnes of LNG per annum at Dabhol, of which 2.1 million tonnes will be used for running the power plant. The remaining 2.9 million tonnes will be sold to other consumers in the energy-starved western region.

 A team of Bhel, Gail and NTPC officials have already inspected the plant and found it in good shape despite being closed for the last five years. A settlement with GE and Bechtel has paved the way for the revival of the closed power plant.

 Gail chairman Proshanto Banerjee said the cost estimates have been worked out to enable power from the Dabhol plant to be supplied at Rs 2.30 per kwh. 

 However, all the financial claims involving GE and Bechtel have to be settled before Ratnagiri Gas and Power can actually move in. The process laid out by the debt recovery tribunal will have to be followed for the acquisition. 

 The LNG terminal being planned by Gail will have a capacity of 5 million tonnes, which could generate up to 5,000 mw of power.

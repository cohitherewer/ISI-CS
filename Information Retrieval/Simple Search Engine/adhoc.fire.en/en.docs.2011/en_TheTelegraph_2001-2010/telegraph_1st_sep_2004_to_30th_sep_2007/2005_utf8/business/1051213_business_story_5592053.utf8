 Calcutta, Dec. 12: Deutsche Bank today rolled out international gold debit-cum-ATM card in India with Visa International as part of the banks recent retail foray. This makes Deutsche Bank the first foreign bank in India to offer a gold debit card.

 The banks launch of debit card has been prompted by the current trend that in the country debit cards are growing at a much faster pace than credit cards. There are 21 million debit card holders in India compared with 10 million credit card holders. Besides, nearly 20 per cent of all plastic money payments in the country is made through debit cards.

 With the launch of its gold debit card, Deutsche Bank also started its retail banking services in the city today to fulfil the banking and financial services needs of individual customers. This is the seventh branch of the bank which is offering retail services in India. 

 Addressing a press conference here Ajay Bimbhet, the banks managing director and head of retail banking in India, said, By the end of this year we will start offering retail services in Delhi, too. This will take our total number of branches offering retail products to eight.

 The banks gold debit card offers flexible point of sale limits, free ATM transactions in 30,000 ATMs in 40 countries.

 Elaborating the rationale behind the banks decision to open its first retail branches and services outside Europe in India and not in China, Bimbhet said the steep growth in retail businesses in India had prompted them to offer retail banking services here. Retail banking business grew more than 25 per cent last year alone.

 The bank has set a three-year time horizon to achieve break-even in the retail business. 

 Deutsche Banks core retail offerings in the Indian market include financial planning and advisory services to high net worth customers to help them manage and leverage their financial resources in a sophisticated and structured way, Bimbhet said. He added that the bank was planning to install about 100 ATMs over the next two years. 

 Bimbhet, however, declined to make any forward looking statement about the size of business the countrys third largest foreign bank has been eyeing in the wake of Sebi guidelines to this effect. But he said the banks current asset base in the country was to the tune of Rs 10,000 crore and this has been growing substantially every year. 

 Deutsche Bank is also contemplating to pump in fresh capital as its business grows. At present, the total capital of the bank stands at Rs 1,200 crore.

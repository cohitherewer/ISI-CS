 Clarity call for uniform tariff

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Speak easy

 New Delhi, Aug. 25: Private telecom operators today urged the government to prepare a detailed position paper on the proposed India One tariff. 

 The new tariff will allow users to make local and STD calls at the same rate.

 The operators want to know how the government plans to implement the tariff, including the licensing and interconnectivity issues.

 The proposal for the single tariff has come from communications minister Dayanidhi Maran.

 The two apex bodies representing the telecom operators ? Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) and Association of Unified Service Providers of India (AUSPI) ? have asked the communications ministry for details on IndiaOne.

 T.V. Ramachandran, director-general of COAI, said, ?A position paper would give us a clear understanding of the concept. We can then provide a more comprehensive response on the subject.?

 In his letter to the communications ministry, S.C. Khanna, secretary-general of AUSPI, said, ?The government should focus on addressing and reducing the cost burden on the industry. This would automatically reflect in the tariffs offered.? 

 The operators feel a single tariff is possible with the help of healthy competition and some incentives from the government instead of pressure to drop call charges. 

 Ramachandran has pointed out that long distance/ inter-circle tariffs cannot be brought down to the level of local call rates as this would not be financially feasible. 

 Apart from the concept, terms and conditions, Ramachandran is keen to know how it will be implemented.

 ?Often, several measures and facilities are introduced keeping the consumers? interest in mind. 

 However, the implementation leaves much to be desired. For example, it is now almost three months since the government announced direct connectivity in the four states of Maharashtra, Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. 

 However, the private operators are yet to secure the desired leased lines and direct connectivity,? Ramchandran added.

 COAI has also suggested that the government set up a small committee comprising representatives from the department of telecommunications as well as representatives of stakeholders like COAI, AUSPI and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited.

 AirTel to don cop mantle

 M. RAJENDRAN

 New Delhi, March 1: AirTel broadband and telephone service will soon launch a video surveillance solution in the country that will offer companies and other customers the benefit of remote viewing, local area network access option, both audio-visual monitoring and multi-camera viewing compared with closed-circuit TV.

 The video surveillance solution not only finds application in offices, factories, malls and shopping centres, restaurants, residents, parking areas and play-schools but is also used by the police department to keep a tab on unmanned crossings.

 It is also useful in retail chain stores for centralised surveillance of multiple shops, play schools/ day-care centres enabling parents to see their children, banks for the surveillance of their automatic teller machines (ATM) centres and remote surveillance of factory gates and shopping mall entrances.

 Monitoring can be done either by accessing the Internet over a digital subscriber line (DSL) connection or through a PC installed with the internet protocol (IP) surveillance solution software. However, as a safety measure, the camera can be accessed through the Internet, only through a password.

 AirTel video surveillance solution runs over DSL. It enables both voice and video of a location to be viewed through an IP camera and a DSL connection. By using the software, customers can monitor premises spread across locations in the same city or across cities, simultaneously.

 According to a senior executive in Bharti Broadband, ?Internationally, video surveillance over DSL has been a huge success with not only companies but also the residential segment availing of its multifarious benefits. A large number of entrepreneurs and residents, who felt the need for advanced remote monitoring systems and already had CCTV in place, opted for the video surveillance solution.?

 The primary reason is that the solution enabled them to not only access video feeds remotely but also allowed them to record and mange the images according to their requirements.

 It also acts home camera for parents to see what their kids are doing and for elderly people staying alone.

 The custom-made digital video surveillance solution enables close monitoring of activities remotely and offers a choice of multi-location or single location surveillance. 

 AirTel will offer the service to the corporate segment under the name Business Live 24X7 and to the residential segment under the name Home Live 24X7.

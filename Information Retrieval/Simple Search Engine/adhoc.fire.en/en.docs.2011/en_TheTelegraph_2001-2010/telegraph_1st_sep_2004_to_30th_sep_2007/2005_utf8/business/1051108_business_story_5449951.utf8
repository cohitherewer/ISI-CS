 Qualcomm takes Nokia to court

 Trouble call

 New York/Helsinki, Nov. 7 (Reuters): Wireless technology company Qualcomm Inc. has filed a lawsuit against mobile giant Nokia accusing it of infringing a dozen patents related to the worlds most widespread cell phone standard.

 Qualcomm said on Monday it wanted Nokia to stop selling or producing products in the United States designed for GSM mobile phone networks and that it was demanding financial damages from the Finnish mobile firm.

 The suit comes just days after Nokia, the worlds No. 1 mobile phone maker, and five other high technology companies complained to the European Commission about Qualcomms market practices, accusing it of stifling competition in the third-generation mobile phone chip market.

 A Nokia spokeswoman said the company had no immediate comment on the Qualcomm lawsuit, which was filed in San Diego Federal Court on November 4.

 Qualcomm dominates the market for technology and chips for the CDMA mobile phone technology it has invented. It said Nokia has used some of Qualcomms CDMA technology to improve GSM networks so that they too could achieve faster speeds for data services such as video calls and Internet downloads.

 GSM, short for global system for mobile communications, has become the dominant mobile phone standard used in around two out of every three handsets in the world. The CDMA standard is mostly used in the Americas and parts of Asia.

 Qualcomm said Nokia is infringing its patents by making or selling products in the United States that comply with GSM standards.

 It said the lawsuit affected 11 Qualcomm patents and one owned by its wholly-owned subsidiary, SnapTrack Inc.

 Nokia and other companies, including Ericsson and Texas Instruments, complained to the European Commission late last month about Qualcomm.

 They said Qualcomm offered preferential terms on royalties of technology patents to manufacturers who also bought its chipsets ? the hardware inside a mobile phone ? and stifled competition. The wireless technology company rejected the accusations.

 All mobile phone chip and handset makers need Qualcomms CDMA technology for the third-generation successor of GSM, which is called Wideband-CDMA and UMTS.

 Nokia, Ericsson and others say they have contributed significantly to the WCDMA standard and also expect royalties, which may be hard if Qualcomm sticks to its licensing terms, which Nokia said are quot;not fair and reasonable. quot;

 Natural gas prices to go up

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Power point

 New Delhi, May 27: The government has approved a 12 per cent increase in the price of natural gas supplied by ONGC to the country?s power and fertiliser units. The annual revenue of ONGC is expected to go up by Rs 1,000 crore as a result.

 The upstream oil majors will now get Rs 3,200 per thousand standard cubic metres per day for their natural gas. This rate is Rs 350 more than the present Rs 2,850 per thousand standard cubic metres per day.

 However, the increase has been approved by the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) on an ad hoc basis. A tariff commission will examine in detail the cost of production and transportation of the gas before fixing a final price.

 While the oil majors have been seeking the market price of the gas, the power and fertiliser ministries have been staunchly opposing the move as it will mean an increase in the input costs of power and fertiliser units which supply their products at fixed prices. 

 Any increase in their input costs will also require a rise in the subsidy that the government will have to pay these units.

 The CCEA has also approved linking natural gas prices for consumers in all other sectors to market prices, which is around $3.86 per million British thermal units (MBTU). 

 Private companies like Essar Steel, Maruti, Reliance and several glass manufacturing units along Gail?s HBJ pipeline were also enjoying the benefit of subsidised prices at the expense of the oil majors. 

 The CCEA did not clear an increase in gas transport tariff which Gail (India) was seeking. 

 Natural gas price for the Northeast sector would be 60 per cent of the new price. The power and fertiliser units have a case for paying a controlled price for the gas as they sell electricity and fertiliser at a subsidised price. However, the private sector companies did not have a case at all. 

 In fact, they imposed an additional burden on ONGC. Private companies like Reliance, which have picked up a share in some ONGC-discovered fields, got the market price for their share of the gas in the joint ventures. The difference in price was deducted from the ONGC account.

 The transport sector, industries in Agra and small consumers (consuming less than 0.05 million standard cubic meters per day) have been spared from any hike for three to five years. This decision has been taken as the public transport system and taxi services in metro cities like Delhi have been made to switch to natural gas in order to control pollution.

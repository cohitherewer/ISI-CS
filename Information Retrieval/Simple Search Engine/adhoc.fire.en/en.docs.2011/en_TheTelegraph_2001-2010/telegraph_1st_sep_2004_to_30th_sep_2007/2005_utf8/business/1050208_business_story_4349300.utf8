 Calcutta, Feb. 7: Durgapur Steel Plant has posted a net profit of Rs 475 crore in the first nine months of the current fiscal. 

 Backed by a strong demand for steel, DSP expects to close this fiscal with a record net profit. It had registered a net profit of Rs 81 crore in 2003-04.

 A senior DSP official said the plant has exhibited marginal growth rates in all the major areas of production and was expected to better its performance in the remaining two months.

 Official sources said the plant has focused on special steel this year and has produced around 2 lakh tonnes in the first nine months, achieving a growth of over 38 per cent. The plant had produced 1,21,329 tonnes in the corresponding previous period. 

 DSP has also developed S-profile or high-speed locomotive wheels for Indian Railways, which are now under field trials. 

 The officials said the plant had sent these high-speed wheels to the Kharagpur Workshop for field trials last year. 

 The wheels have better heat dissipation during braking and can be used at high speeds too, the officials said. 

 DSP supplies Indian Railways with BG coaching and loco wheels.

 The wheel and axle plant of DSP will supply over 60,000 wheels to the railways this year. The wheel and axle plant grew over 43 per cent in the first 10 months of the current fiscal against the corresponding previous year. 

 DSP will invest Rs 2,800 crore in the next seven years to jack up the present capacity of 1.86 million tonnes to 3 million tonnes. 

 The investment will help DSP route most of its crude steel output through the continuous casting route, reduce the cost of production and improve the product mix.

 At present, the plant?s product mix has over 50 per cent semis, which badly affect its net sales realisation (NSR). While a bloom caster, two ladle furnaces and a reheating furnace are being installed, the plant also plans to set up a bar and rod mill and a medium structural mill to enhance its finished component in the product mix.

 The plant has already installed a fracture toughness testing machine to improve wheel quality and set up a 7th feeder to the township to augment power supply and disposal of bio-medical waste.

 DSP officials said the tar injection facility in blast furnace number 2 is expected to be commissioned soon, while the schemes for cold dust injection, a new oxygen plant and section mill revamp are also in progress.

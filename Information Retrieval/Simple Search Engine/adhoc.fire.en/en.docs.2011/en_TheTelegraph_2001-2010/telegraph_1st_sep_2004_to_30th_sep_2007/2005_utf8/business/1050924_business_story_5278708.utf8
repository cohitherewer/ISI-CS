 CESCs Haldia plan cleared

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Sept. 23: The Bengal government has cleared CESCs proposed 1,000-mw (2x500-mw) thermal plant at Haldia.

 The company had approached Haldia Development Authority (HDA) three weeks back. Within this time, CESC has already approved a 1,000-acre plot for the project.

 The total investment in the project is Rs 4,000 crore, which will funded through a mix of debt and equity.

 This will be CESCs sixth generating station (including Mulajore, which has been closed down) in Bengal. The utility has the capacity to generate 970 mw of power. It now buys 375-400 mw from West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB). 

 Initially, CESC had thought of setting up the plant at Katwa. But as West Bengal Power Development Corporation Limited (WBPDCL) had already planned a plant there, CESC went for Haldia.

 The company will now have to look for coal supplies. It had already applied to the Union coal ministry for captive coal blocks in the Asansol-Raniganj area. The approval has not come so far.

 We are constantly pursuing the matter with the coal ministry. We expect clearances from the government soon, senior officials of the company said.

 Sources said the management would now have to work out the funding modalities. The company has already approached overseas agencies for loans at cheap rates.

 Push to captive power purchase

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL 

 Calcutta, April 10: The West Bengal Electricity Regulatory Commission (WBERC) has directed the West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) and CESC to purchase power from captive and non-conventional energy sources in line with the National Electricity Policy.

 The regulatory commission will take into consideration power purchase from these sources while computing the tariff for 2006-07 for both the utilities. WBERC has also asked the utilities to submit a report on the progress made on purchase of power from these sources by October. 

 ?In the tariff order of 2006-07, the commission may, in terms of Section 86 (1) (e) of the Electricity Act, 2003, specify the quantum of such energy from renewable, non-conventional or co-generation source as a percentage of total sales in the distribution licensee?s area. After this, each year the share of electricity from co-generation and renewable, non-conventional energy will be progressively increased in line with the National Electricity Policy,? WBERC said.

 To promote non-conventional and renewable energy projects, the Bengal government has decided to charge 1 paisa levy per unit on the thermal power plants. The government estimates to mop up Rs 25-30 crore through this levy.

 The regulatory commission also wants WBSEB to introduce availability-based tariff (ABT) for its bulk consumers. ABT ? a technical term in power parlance ? helps to fix the quantum of power that the utility can sell to its client at a fixed price. The tariff is decided on the availability of power. A penalty is charged if either party fails to keep its commitment.

 According to the National Tariff Policy, the ABT regime at the state level is to be introduced within a year. The generating companies and the distribution licensees, including WBSEB, have been directed by WBERC to submit a report within three months. This report will outline how ABT should be introduced for bulk exchanges among the licensees and for supply to bulk consumers with contracted demand of 5 MVA and above.

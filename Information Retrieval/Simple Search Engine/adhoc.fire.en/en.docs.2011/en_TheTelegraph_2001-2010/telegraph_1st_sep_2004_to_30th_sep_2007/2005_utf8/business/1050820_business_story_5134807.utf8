 Calcutta, Aug. 19: The Orissa tourism ministry has appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to recommend measures to attract more tourists to the state. 

 The consultant has already submitted two preliminary reports and is expected to table the final one in the next two months.

 PwC is working on a number of issues that are hindering growth in tourism and will suggest measures to improve. The first step is to study the organisational structure within the ministry and suggest changes for smooth functioning. The consultants will also look at existing laws related to forests, environment, coastal region management and excise, said Santosh Kumar Sarangi, director and additional secretary of the department of tourism, Orissa.

 The state government generates around Rs 550 crore from tourism every year. Studies show a potential to rake in Rs 2300 crore.

 PwC is also conducting a survey to study tourist perception and preferences. We will also identify places like Southeast Asia to market specific tourist circuits like the Buddhist circuit, said Sarangi. 

 The Orissa government will send a delegation to Bangkok on August 25 to promote the state. The ministry has also appointed Mudra to prepare a campaign and develop an action plan to promote the state, which will be ready by October-end.

 We have already acquired 1000 acres of land near Puri and have appointed an international architect to design a tourist village, said Sarangi. The project will be built through public-private partnership.

 We are in talks with other hospitality groups to set up accommodation infrastructure at tourist destinations across the state, Surya Narayan Patra, tourism minister of Orissa, said at an expo organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Orissa also plans to develop eco-tourism in the Chilka area.

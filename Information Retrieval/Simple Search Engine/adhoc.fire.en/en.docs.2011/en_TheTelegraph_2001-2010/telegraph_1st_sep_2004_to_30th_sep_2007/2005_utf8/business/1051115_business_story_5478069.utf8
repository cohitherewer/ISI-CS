 $100-bn exports in sight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: Commerce minister Kamal Nath today upped the ante on the export front, raising the countrys merchandise export target for 2005-06 to $100 billion from the $93-billion-mark set earlier. 

 During 2004-05, the countrys exports had exceeded the target of $75 billion for the year. 

 The nations services exports during the current fiscal could touch $50 billion, and thats in addition to the $100 billion in merchandise exports, the minister said in his welcome address at the India International Trade Fair. The fair was inaugurated today.

 If we add $180 billion worth of imports by the country to this $150 billion of exports, Indias commercial engagement with the rest of the world this year will be in the region of $330 billion, he added.

 The countrys total exports during April-October period this calendar amounted to $51 billion, representing a cumulative growth rate of more than 22 per cent over the same period of the previous year.

 However, the surge in international crude prices raised the countrys oil import bill to $25 billion which, together with $50 billion imports of goods and services, resulted in a trade deficit of $24 billion. 

 Last month, Indias merchandise exports have registered a record growth of nearly 28 per cent, reflecting the countrys growing competitiveness. 

 The countrys merchandise exports in October have crossed $8 billion, which is 27.54 per cent higher than the $6.3 billion achieved during the corresponding period last year.

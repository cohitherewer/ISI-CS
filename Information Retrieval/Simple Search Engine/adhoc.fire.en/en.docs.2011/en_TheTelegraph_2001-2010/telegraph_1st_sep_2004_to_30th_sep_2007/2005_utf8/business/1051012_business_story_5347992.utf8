 ONGC in Assam flap

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Oct. 11: The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation is ready to invest Rs 3,300 crore in Assam to double its crude output in the next three years. However, the law and order situation in the state will determine whether the funds will actually flow in. 

 An ONGC director told The Telegraph that the company is facing a lot of pressure from local agents over awarding of contracts. Even if proper equipment or expertise is not available within the state, there is stiff opposition to awarding contracts to outsiders. We cannot proceed with our work plans in such an environment. 

 He said while ONGC contracts in Gujarat were given on the basis of global tenders, this was not permitted in Assam. The ONGC management has taken up the issue with the state government.

 ONGC wants to double its crude output from 1.5 million tonnes to 3 million tonnes in Assam in the next three years. However, the law and order situation poses a major problem. During April to August, it had set a target of producing 1,38,000 tonnes of crude from Assam. However, it could produce 1,14,000 tonnes, or 82.6 per cent of the target. Frequent strikes in the state have been cited as one of the major reasons for this shortfall.

 The state government has to tackle the situation and help ONGC raise its crude output. Higher crude output will mean more royalty for the state. At present, ONGC pays over Rs 200 crore every year as royalty to Assam. In 2003-04, it had paid Rs 211.74 crore. 

 In May, ONGC was forced to shut down all its oilfields in Assam for four days as All Assam Students Union (AASU) activists forced the crew to move out of the operational areas at the producing wells. The state government had refused to come to its rescue. ONGC is the biggest employer in the state and senior officials feel that AASU activists do not have any case for resorting to such tactics.

 Deal with Mittal

 ONGC and the Mittal group today signed agreements to form two joint-venture firms for exploration of oil and gas assets and related businesses abroad, adds PTI. ONGC Videsh and Mittal Investment Sarl will jointly set up ONGC-Mittal Energy Ltd for acquiring oil and gas properties abroad.

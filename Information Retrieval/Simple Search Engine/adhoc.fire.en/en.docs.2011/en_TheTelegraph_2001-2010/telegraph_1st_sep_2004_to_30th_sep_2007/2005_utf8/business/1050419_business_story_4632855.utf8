 Yes Bank IPO likely in May

 New Delhi, April 18 (PTI): Yes Bank is likely to hit the market in the second week of May with its initial public offering (IPO) of 7 crore shares to raise up to Rs 300 crore.

 ?If everything goes well, the Yes Bank IPO will open in the week starting May 9,? CEO Rana Kapoor said.

 The bank has already filed a red herring prospectus with Sebi for its offer through the book-building process.

 Though the bank is yet to announce a price band for the offer, it could be in the range of Rs 30-42, according to market sources. The bank has appointed DSP Merrill Lynch and Enam Financial Services as the lead managers of the IPO. Yes Bank is also planning to raise about Rs 100 crore through tier-II capital by September, Kapoor said.

 Stake of two promoters in the bank ? Rana Kapoor and Ashok Kapur ? will come down from 52 per cent to about 40 per cent post-offer.

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: The communications ministry has set up a joint working group of mobile operators to resolve the contentious issues of spectrum allocation, access deficit charge, point of interconnection and other spectrum-related clearances.

 Telecom minister Dayanidhi Maran will head the panel. Reliance, Tata and the Association of Unified Service Providers of India will represent the CDMA (code division multiple access) operators. The GSM (global system of mobile communications) operators will be represented by Bharti, Hutch and the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI).

 The group will be formed by the end of this month and is expected to submit its report by December end.

 Both CDMA and GSM operators want a revenue-sharing arrangement in lieu of the access deficit charge (ADC). It is a charge operators pay to compensate service providers for offering services at a lower cost to meet social obligations set by the government, like offering telephones in rural and inaccessible areas at a higher infrastructure cost.

 The COAI and other GSM operators met Maran and sought an equitable distribution of spectrum.

 COAI director-general T.V. Ramachandran said, There are many issues that will be taken up, but the important one is allocation of spectrum because we (operators) are choking in many areas.

 Spectrum are airwaves, on which calls and data travel. 

 The minister has asked for a proposal on revenue sharing in lieu of the ADC and we will have to sit together to evolve a solution. The minister wants all these contentious issue to be resolved by December, Ramachandran said.

 He also emphasised upon a quick roll out of networks in rural areas.

 We have got a clear message from the minister that the government is ready to move to a revenue-share arrangement and that all issues coming in the way of achieving the 250-million telephone subscriber target will get his urgent attention, said Bharti group chief Sunil B. Mittal.

 COAI will propose a hybrid revenue sharing model, which will put the higher load of the ADC burden on incoming international long distance calls and its operators, while Indian consumers and operators would be protected. 

 We will place this issue before the minister as a part of the joint working group, Ramachandran said.

 Commenting on the possible discord between CDMA and GSM operators, Mittal said, The industry is mature today. It can sort out these issues under the leadership of the minister. I am confident an equitable solution will be found to make both sides happy.

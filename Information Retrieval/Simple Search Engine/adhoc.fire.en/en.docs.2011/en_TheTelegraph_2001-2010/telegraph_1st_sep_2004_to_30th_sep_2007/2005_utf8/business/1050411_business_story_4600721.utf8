The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Q amp;A

 For my child

 I have a PPF account in my name and now wish to open another account in the name of my minor child. Can I invest Rs 70,000 in each of the accounts? 

 Buddhadeb Dutta, Calcutta

 You can invest Rs 70,000 in each of the accounts. However, you will be entitled to receive tax benefit for the amount deposited in your account.

 Metaphysical speculation

 I hold some shares in physical form but did not dematerialise them since I was not keen on selling them. Is it now possible to transfer these shares to my legal heir?

 C. K. Pillai, by e-mail

 You shall have to approach the registrar of these companies for share transfer and accordingly send the original share certificates along with the prescribed forms.

 Tax token

 I am a senior citizen and a retired central government pensioner. My annual income is Rs 1.62 lakh from various sources, including pension and interest income. Do I have to pay tax for the assessment year 2005-06?

 M. R. Mukherjee, Calcutta

 For the assessment year 2005-06, you can claim standard deduction up to Rs 30,000, deduction under section 80L for interest income on various securities and a further tax rebate of Rs 20,000. Thus, if you can take full tax benefits, you shall not be required to pay any tax.

 Buy and sell

 I have sold my house in December and to save on capital gains tax, I intend to buy a flat at the earliest. However, since such a purchase is time consuming, is there any time frame of completing the process?

 Jayanti Ghosh, by e-mail

 You have to purchase the flat within two years from the date of sale. However, if you cannot purchase the flat within the date of return filing, you can deposit the amount in a ?capital gain deposit scheme? with a nationalised bank.

 If you have any queries about investing or taxes or a high-cost purchase you are planning, mail to: btgraphabpmail.com, or write to: Business Telegraph, 6 Prafulla Sarkar Street, Calcutta 700 001.

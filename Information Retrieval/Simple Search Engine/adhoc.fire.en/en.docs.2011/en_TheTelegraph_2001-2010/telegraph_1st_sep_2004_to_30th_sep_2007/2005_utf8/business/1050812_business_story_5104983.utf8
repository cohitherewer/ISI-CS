 Calcutta, Aug. 11: Bank of India plans to expand its operations overseas and is currently targeting five countries.

 The bank will open offices in Belgium, China, Vietnam, Tanzania and Qatar. We have already got approvals from the government and the Reserve Bank of India for these offices. However, we are yet to get regulators approval in those countries, chairman and managing director M. Balachandran said.

 We are eyeing countries whose foreign trade with India is growing fast, said Balachandran. Besides, the bank was also considering a new office in Bangladesh and reopening its Karachi branch in Pakistan, which was wound up due to political upheavals.

 We are going to open offices in Antwerp, Belgium because of its growing gems and jewellery trade with India. In China, we already have a branch and will open another office in Beijing. In Vietnam, the existing office will be converted into a full-fledged branch, he said. In West Asia, the bank plans to set up an office at Doha in Qatar.

 Bank of India is the first public sector bank to set up a foreign branch and has 24 offices across 20 countries at present.

 The overseas branches account for about 20 per cent of the banks total business. However, we plan to maintain the same proportion of business as we expect a similar growth within the country, said Balachandran.

 The bank will also raise tier-II capital of Rs 300-500 crore to improve its capital adequacy ratio (CAR) by about 0.5 per cent, which had witnessed a decline in from 11.3 per cent last fiscal to 10.5 per cent in June.

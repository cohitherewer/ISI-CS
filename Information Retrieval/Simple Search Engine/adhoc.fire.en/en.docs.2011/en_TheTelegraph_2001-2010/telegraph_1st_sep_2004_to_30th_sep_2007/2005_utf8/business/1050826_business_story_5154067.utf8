 Check on inflation

 Lahiri

 New Delhi, Aug. 24 (PTI): The rate of inflation will not rise much from the present level of 3.35 per cent even if domestic fuel prices are hiked in due course of time, the finance ministry said today.

 Though the concerns arising out of volatile global crude prices continue, chief economic adviser Ashok Lahiri said, The inflation was coming down week after week since June 25. So far, so good.

 Inflation had come down mainly because of adequate supply of essential items and the Reserve Banks prudent management of money supply.

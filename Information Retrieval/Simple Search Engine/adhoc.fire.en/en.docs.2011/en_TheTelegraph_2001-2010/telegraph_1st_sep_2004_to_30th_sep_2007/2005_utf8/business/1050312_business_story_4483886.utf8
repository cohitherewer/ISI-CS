 Farm subsidies to stay for now

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 11: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today indicated in Parliament that he is in favour of continuing with farm sector subsidies. However, he added that the current system of providing fertiliser subsidy needed some ?rethinking?.

 Replying to a question in the lower House, Chidambaram said: ?No decision has been taken (to cut subsidy on agriculture). All the government has done so far is place a paper for discussion in the house. No decision will be taken until all stakeholders are consulted.?

 The government hopes to start phasing out the contentious fertiliser subsidy this year. This will help the government save another Rs 2,000 crore. The report of a group of ministers on this is expected to be ready soon.

 Despite opposition to the move from both industry and certain political quarters, this could kick-start the process of rationalising the policy of paying out a retention price to urea manufacturers.

 The government has also been working on a pilot project of issuing food stamps to the poor. If this succeeds, then it could replace the current system and thereby reduce leakages and high costs of delivering food to the poor. Chidambaram said he was open to giving export subsidy for the short-term or for specific crops.

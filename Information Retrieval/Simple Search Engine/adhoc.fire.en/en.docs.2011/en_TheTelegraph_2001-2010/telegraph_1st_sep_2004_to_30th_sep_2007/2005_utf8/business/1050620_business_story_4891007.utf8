 Core sector turns area of focus

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

Mumbai, June 19: It is not telecom, power or 

financial services alone where Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprises will try to excel. 

The younger Ambani has made infrastructure a key area of focus.

 Indicating just how keen he was on the core sector, Anil said he would be interested in creating infrastructure when projects come up.

 The process of identifying opportunities in this sphere has already begun. 

 Anil divulged that apart from bidding for the privatisation of Mumbai and Delhi airports, he would also be interested in the proposed trans-harbour link coming up in Mumbai and the mass rapid transport system being laid out in the commercial capital.

 Commenting on the bid for privatisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports, Ambani said he had information to believe that the bids for these will not be finalised by June 24.

 There have been reports in recent months that Reliance joined hands with Mexicos ASA, one of the largest airport operators in the world, to bid for privatisation of the twin air hubs. 

 ASA, owned by the Mexican government, is picking up a minority holding in a special-purpose vehicle to be promoted by the Reliance group. 

 On the other hand, various other consortia have expressed their interest in the Mumbai trans-harbour link in the first phase of its implementation. 

 When completed, it will be the second-longest bridge in the world. 

 The first phase, estimated to cost over Rs 4000 crore, will have a 22-km six-lane sea link connecting Nhava with Sewri, from where there will be two overhead bridges across existing roads.

 For the Rs 1500-crore mass rapid transport project, Reliance has shown its interest by filing a technical bid. Apart from the Ambanis, others who are keen on the project are Siemens and Hindustan Construction Company.

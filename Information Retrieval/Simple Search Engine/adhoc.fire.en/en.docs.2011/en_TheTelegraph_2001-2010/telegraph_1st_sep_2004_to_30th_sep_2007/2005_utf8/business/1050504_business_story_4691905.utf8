The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Sonata buys 5.27% of Saregama 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 3: Sonata Investments Limited, an investment company, has acquired a 5.27 per cent stake in Saregama India Limited (SIL), the music and entertainment company from the R. P. Goenka stable. SIL has informed the National Stock Exchange about the acquisition. 

 Sonata Investments has acquired 492,113 shares of SIL through market purchases between April 6 and April 27. Market sources say it had picked up the shares at different prices ranging between Rs 100 and Rs 135 per share during the period.

 SIL officials are, however, not sure whether Sonata has bought over a chunk of shares from EMI Records. The British music giant, EMI Records, had pulled out from SIL by selling off its entire holding of 720,000 shares, representing 7.71 per cent stake, in the open market on April 5 and April 6.

 More recently, a host of investors, including Fidelity Investments, have shown keen interest in the Saregama counter. Fidelity, one of the world?s largest investment banker, has picked up a 5.26 per cent stake in SIL for nearly Rs 10 crore.

 In fact, foreign financial institutions together now hold a 17.93 per cent stake in SIL. Over the last six months, FID Funds of Mauritius picked up a 5.26 per cent stake, Arisaig Partners (Asia Fund) acquired 3.99 per cent, Arisaig Partners (India fund) bought 3.21 per cent and Indiaman Fund of Mauritius cornered a 0.21 per cent stake in Saregama.

 Analysts say Saregama?s strategy of strengthening its core music and focusing on business opportunities in publishing, home video, digital downloads have paid off. It recently floated a rights issue for Rs 45 a share and the issue was oversubscribed.

 The music company has also entered into film production and has tied up with MGM Studios for marketing modern Hollywood films in India.

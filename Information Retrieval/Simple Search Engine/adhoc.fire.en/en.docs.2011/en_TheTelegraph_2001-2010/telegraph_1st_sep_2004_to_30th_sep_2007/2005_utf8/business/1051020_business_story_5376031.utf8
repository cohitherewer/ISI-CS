 Tug-of-war over rupee, rate course

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Oct. 19: The countrys economic policy makers are locked in a battle to decide the course that the rupee should take and the wisdom of nudging up interest rates to prop up the faltering currency.

 The Planning Commission and sections within the finance ministry favour a stronger rupee and buttress their argument by saying that this will partly cushion the burden imposed by the rising oil import bill.

 However, the commerce ministry mandarins feel that the rupee should be allowed to weaken further to a dollar to help exporters, especially BPO operations. 

 The rupee has been weakening because of a growing current account deficit, which stood at a high of $6.2 billion in this financial years first quarter itself and high oil prices, which has created a demand for dollars. 

 Moreover, the narrowing interest rate differentials with the US markets and expectations that the Federal Reserve would raise rates has seen many firms sucking out dollars from Asia. 

 Much to the delight of exporters, the Institute of Economic Growth ? the governments principal economic think tank ? has forecast that the rupee-dollar rate will continue to fall. The currency has lost 2.7 per cent in October. Strong foreign investment in Indian stocks had been cushioning the rupee for most of the year. But with the demand for dollars rising in recent weeks, the rupee is expected to lose further ground. 

 The move to allow the rupee to weaken has always been partially deliberate. It is aimed at helping out our exports, which have lost their competitive edge against several countries, officials explained. 

 But a section in the Planning Commission and the finance ministry feels it is necessary to pull up the rupee to meet the rising import bill. They contend that a sharp rise in the rupee will also keep inflation at bay, a fact that is sure to help the government in state elections ahead. They would like a range of 40 to 45 to the dollar. 

 A rising rupee helps reduce the rapidly increasing import bill in domestic currency terms. A falling rupee has its advantages as well as disadvantages. But above all, what we and the RBI are concerned about is a sharp volatility in the money market, said top finance ministry officials. North Block has been in constant touch with the Reserve Bank on the rupee trend.

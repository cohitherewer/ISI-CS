 Hero Honda gears up

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 9: Hero Honda is ready to meet challenges headlong to maintain its leadership in the motorbike segment. This includes a possible cut in margin too. The motorbike major hopes to actually save Rs 25 crore through the cut in margin. 

 ?There is pressure on margins due to competition and rising raw material prices... We expect this to continue for some time,? managing director Pawan Munjal said. ?The positive side is the margins we enjoy are above world averages. A price cut will be our last option,? he said. 

 Hero Honda has also cut the time it takes to pay vendors when buying parts from 45 days to 15 days.

 Hero Honda, in which Japan?s Honda Motor Company holds a 26 per cent stake, expects better operating margins with the new payment plan for vendors. Sources said 35 of Hero Honda?s total 225 vendors have agreed to the plan. 

 The company?s net income fell in the quarter ended March 31 ? its first quarterly decline in two years.

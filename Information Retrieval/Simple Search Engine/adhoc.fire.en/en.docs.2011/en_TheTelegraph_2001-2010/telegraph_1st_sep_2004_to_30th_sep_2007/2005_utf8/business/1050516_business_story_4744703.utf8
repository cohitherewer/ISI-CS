 Banerjee: New challenge

 Calcutta, May 15: RPG Enterprises, which has parted ways with the Hong Kong-based Dairy Farm International, is drawing up a strategy to rapidly expand its Rs 1,000-crore retail business.

 The growth strategy may temporarily push back the groups plan to tap the market with an initial public offering.

 The group has brought in Sumantra Banerjee, managing director of CESC, to navigate the retail business plan. He has been given the additional charge of the retail business after Raghu Pillai, who headed the division, resigned.

 The strategy is aimed at achieving a turnover of Rs 2,500 crore by 2007-08 from the retail business. Steps are also being taken to increase the retail space from 6.4 lakh square feet to 15 lakh square feet by 2007-08.

 The retail business will comprise 25 per cent of the groups turnover while power will contribute 30 per cent and tyre and raw materials 35 per cent. The remaining 10 per cent will come from other businesses.

 The RPG group had initiated the organised retail movement in the country through a joint venture with Dairy Farm International with a series of Foodworld stores, primarily in the south. Thereafter, RPG forayed into hypermarkets under the brand name Giant. The company has decided to rename its hypermarkets as Spencers. 

 Explaining the rationale behind bringing in Banerjee, who is also a board member of RPG, sources said the group feels that he is a strong hand on implementing skills.

 However, search is on for a suitable head for the retail business to whom Banerjee will hand over this portfolio as RPG has ambitious growth plans for power.

 Following the separation of RPG and Dairy Farm International, the former will retail 48 of the 93 Foodworld stores and the latter 45.

 Sources said RPG Enterprises will sell its rights to the Foodworld brand to Dairy Farm. It will call the retail stores of the Foodworld chain Spencers Supermarket.

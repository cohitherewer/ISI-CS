 Kerosene fans flames of row

 S. P. S. PANNU 

 Supply constraints

 New Delhi, June 21: Serious differences have surfaced between Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Reliance Industries over supplies of kerosene and LPG that the public sector company has to pick up from the Jamnagar refinery of the Ambani group flagship.

 According to sources, IOC has complained to the petroleum ministry that Reliance is not supplying adequate quantities of kerosene following which it is becoming increasingly difficult to fulfil the requirements of the public distribution system for the fuel.

 Reliance wants to slash LPG supplies, too, to PSU oil firms, including IOC. The privately run company is keen to export these two fuels as it can get a better price in the international market, according to petroleum ministry sources. 

 The petroleum ministry is reported to have told the commerce ministry to put LPG and kerosene on the restricted list of exports. If the move comes through then the two commodities will be allowed for export only if they are available in surplus quantities in the country. Since kerosene is essentially a jet fuel sold in the international market, inclusion of jet fuel in the restricted list would check kerosene exports.

 The PSU oil companies are losing over Rs 11 per litre on kerosene sold through the public distribution system and around Rs 130 per cylinder on LPG. If they are forced to go in for extra imports of these two products, their losses will mount further. 

 While all the stand-alone public sector refineries, such as Mangalore Refinery and Chennai Refinery, are supplying kerosene and LPG to state-owned oil distribution and marketing companies, Reliance being a private company tends to choose its own way. 

 The refineries have been making profits at the cost of the downstream marketing companies, which have to sell these fuels at subsidised prices. These marketing companies now want that the refiners, too, shoulder the burden. The marketing companies argument is that the refinery margins in India, which had recently gone up to $6-8 per barrel, are the highest in the world. Refinery margins in neighbouring Singapore is as low as $2-3 per barrel.

 According to IOC officials, Reliance has been diverting LPG for exports whenever international prices moved up. Consequently, IOC was forced to go in for the last minute purchases through imports to meet the domestic demand. Since Indian companies are seen as big buyers, the prices of LPG tend to shoot up when they make sudden purchases. 

 Similar is the case with kerosene. The public sector companies have to buy it from the international market at a much higher price. 

 Kerosene requires minor refining for conversion into aviation turbine fuel. An aviation fuel is used in planes flying at high altitude where temperatures could drop to minus 50 degrees Centigrade. So it is essential that the fuel does not freeze at these extremely low temperatures.

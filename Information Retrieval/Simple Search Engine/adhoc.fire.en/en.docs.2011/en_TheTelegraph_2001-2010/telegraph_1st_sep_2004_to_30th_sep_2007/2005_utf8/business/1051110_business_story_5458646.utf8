 Calcutta, Nov. 9: The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government seems to have finally managed to impress upon the international community that Bengal is a good place to do business.

 The trade delegation accompanying Czech Republic President Valclav Klaus chose Calcutta for a stop-over today and met with the business community here.

 Martin Tlapa, deputy minister for industry and trade, said he was aware that the state was a favourable destination for business and hence, many senior executives of Czech firms chose to visit the city.

 In the past, many big trade delegations had bypassed the city repelled by its negative image.

 We see a good potential here, Tlapa told reporters on the sidelines of a CII-organised trade meet here. 

 The trade delegation comprises representatives from Skoda Power and Ceske Aerolinie, the Czech airlines. 

 The minister pointed out that there could be joint ventures in the areas of information technology and infrastructure projects like power. We understand there are different business environment in different states. However, we are impressed by Bengal and its rapid growth and so we are here. 

 Czech Republic boasts of strong engineering prowess in different sectors. It has executed some 100 projects in India so far. The delegation has also brought with it investment bankers and lawyers to help forge alliances.

 The east European country also sees opportunity in railways, urban and suburban transport systems, machine tools, automotive industry, textiles, environmental technologies, chemical and petrochemicals among others.

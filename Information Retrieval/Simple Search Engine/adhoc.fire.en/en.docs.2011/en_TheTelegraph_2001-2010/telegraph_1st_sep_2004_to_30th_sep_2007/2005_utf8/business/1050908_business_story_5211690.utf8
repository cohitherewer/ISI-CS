The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Fast forward with two-way trade sops 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: India and the European Union today sought trade and investment concessions from each other. 

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath has asked the EU countries to lift the barriers imposed against Indian goods and business process outsourcing (BPO) services, while Alan Johnson, UK minister for trade and industry, said outsourcing of services would have to be a two-way street and India should open up its accountancy and insurance services and its retail sector to foreign direct investment. 

 Kamal Nath told the India-EU business summit there was a great demographic synergy between India, which has a large number of young skilled workers, and greying Europe. 

 Our young people are ideally suited to fill the gap for skilled workers required to maintain the current productivity and efficiency levels in Europe, he added.

 The minister said, I speak not of immigration, but of services delivered remotely in our cyber-connected world in which India has demonstrated skills. If Europe has to achieve the Lisbon agenda target of becoming the most competitive economy in the world then EU will have to look at outsourcing as a business co-operation model and fears over possible job losses should be removed from the minds of the people, Johnson added.

 Johnson was following up on what his Prime Minister, Tong Blair, said about outsourcing he shared the dais with Manmohan Singh. In what was music to Indian ears, Blair asserted that outsourcing was there to stay since it helped economies of the developed countries.

 Dismissing fears of loss of jobs in developed world due to outsourcing, he said the process had, instead, helped boost profits of business houses in Europe. It was initially feared that outsourcing or relocation would cause job losses. But companies have used it to move up the value chain and create better structure, Blair added.

 The commerce minister said if such a model has to succeed, Indian professionals would also have to be allowed to travel more freely to Europe.

 He added that an ambitious joint action plan had been drawn up by both sides at the highest level to take the India-EU partnership forward. Nath said, Trade must play a central role in the development of this relationship.

 Asking the EU to address the issue of non-tariff barriers to Indias exports, he lamented that while tariffs may be low, the mounting stringency of standards, complex procedures and frequent use of anti-dumping measures to bar Indian goods were emerging as serious barriers to trade.

 Nath highlighted the market access problem faced by agro and marine exports to EU because of sanitary and phytosanitary related legislations and said, not all such standards are in conformity with the international ones and are often based on excessive precaution and perceived rather than real risk.

 But his British counterpart Johnson not only reproached India for not opening up retail and financial services, but also pointed to the concerns over high duties on European spirits and wines. 

 EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson said India needs to open up its markets further and usher in a more liberal FDI regime as it was lagging way behind China and South Korea. 

 However, he said that textiles and clothing was a sensitive issue for Europe. India had emerged as the biggest beneficiary under the generalised system of preferences with its exports to the EU touching $7 billion in 2004.

 One more meet on gas pricing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Costly proposition

 New Delhi, Jan. 25: The petroleum ministry today made out a case for raising the price of natural gas at the group of ministers? meeting held here today. No decision was reached on the issue as the fertiliser and power ministries are staunchly opposed to any hike in the price of natural gas.

 Another meeting has been scheduled next month to discuss the issue.

 On November 24 last year, the cabinet had referred the petroleum ministry?s proposal to raise the price of natural gas to a group of ministers in the face of stiff resistance from the fertiliser ministry and the power ministry. 

 The petroleum ministry had drawn up a proposal to increase the price of natural gas for fertiliser units from Rs 2,800 per million British thermal units (Btu) to Rs 3,200 per million Btu and to Rs 3,600 per million Btu for power plants. 

 However, both the fertiliser and power ministries want the price of natural gas to remain at the existing level as the price of fertilisers and power are also regulated. The power and fertiliser sectors are the two main consumers of the gas in the country. 

 The petroleum ministry had moved the proposal for an interim hike in the price of natural gas. The power and fertiliser ministries have also been arguing that the cost of producing and transporting natural gas in the country do not warrant an increase in the price. 

 Meanwhile, British Gas (BG) has put the government in a dilemma by demanding what appears to be an ?exorbitant price? for the 10 to 12 million standard cubic metres per day (MMSCMD) of natural gas that is supplied from the western offshore Panna-Mukta and Tapti fields to the vital power and fertiliser units of the country. 

 Sources said Gail (India) Ltd, which transports the gas, has informed the petroleum ministry that the current market price of the gas should range between $3.1 and $3.6 per million Btu. BG, however, is insisting on a price of $4.5 to $5.6 per million Btu. 

 Reliance Industries, which also stands to gain by the higher price, is expected to play along with its British partner leaving only the public sector ONGC to lend support to the government. 

 The crux of the matter is that power plants and fertiliser units producing urea have to sell their outputs at a regulated price and, therefore, cannot afford to buy gas at such an exorbitant price. 

 Currently, the natural gas from the other ONGC and OIL fields in the country is being supplied at $2.5 per million Btu, while liquefied natural gas that is being imported from Qatar at the Dahej terminal in Gujarat by the pubic sector Petronet LNG is being sold at $4.1 per million Btu.

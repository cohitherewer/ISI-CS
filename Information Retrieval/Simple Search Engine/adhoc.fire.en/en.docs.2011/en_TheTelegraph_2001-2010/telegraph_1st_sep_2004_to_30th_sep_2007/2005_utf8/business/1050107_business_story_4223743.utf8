 Calls afar to cost less, but only just

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 6: Long-distance domestic and international calls will become cheaper, but probably by not too much.

 The STD tariff for calls made within 200 km will drop by 20 to 30 paise and by 50 paise beyond 200 km. ISD rates will drop by Rs 1.75 ? all per minute. There will be no change in local call rates.

 The lower rates will follow from a cut in the access deficit charge recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India today.

 Access deficit charge (ADC) is a levy operators pay to fund other companies which offer services in rural and inaccessible areas where infrastructure cost is high but yield is low. It?s a method of subsidising rural telecom services.

 Bharat Sanchar Nigam (BSNL) is the largest rural operator by a long way and is, therefore, the recipient of ADC from private operators, like Bharti or Reliance Infocomm. The telecom regulator has proposed a fixed rate of 30 paise per minute as ADC for all domestic calls. Earlier, there were different rates for different distances. 

 It has also proposed to lower ADC on incoming international calls to Rs 3.25 a minute from Rs 4.25. The outgoing rate has been cut from Rs 4.25 to Rs 2.50 a minute.

 The new regime comes into effect from February 1. The regulator has said the ADC rates will be reviewed within three to six months of implementation on the basis of the increase in the volume of calls and subscribers. The regulator expects the new regime to be followed by a competitive market response, resulting in a reduction in call charges. 

 Sunil Bharti Mittal, the chairman and managing director of the Bharti Group, said: ?Benefits of the ADC rate cut would be passed on 100 per cent to the customers.?

 A major reduction has been made in the ADC on outgoing international calls, so the benefit there will also be passed on to the customers.?

 BSNL chairman and managing director A. K. Sinha said: ?We are yet to understand the impact of the new regime. It is unlikely to upset our existing plans. We hope that the reduction would be offset by the growth in volume of calls.?

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) today tied up with Oracle Applications to facilitate software exports. The plan is part of the Centres e-governance initiative.

 STPI is an autonomous body under the ministry of communications and information technology. In the first phase, it has begun on-line registration of exporters and on-line procurement.

 The project is managed by PricewaterhouseCoopers. 

 Arvind Kumar, senior director, STPI, said, The project will not only help in improving process efficiencies within the organisation but also simplify the procedures for over 7,000 software export units across the country who transact with us.

 Through web-based registrations, software exporters can procure their registration certificate instantly on-line after furnishing the required documents. 

 Through on-line procurement, STPIs purchase-to-pay cycle will be simplified and all transactions and interfaces with vendors will take place through the web ensuring greater transparency and efficiency. 

 In the second phase, STPI will automate business processes across its 45 centres and sub-centres using Oracle Applications modules, which include finance, HR with self-service HR, payroll, procurement and sales. 

 The application will help STPI manage orders, inventory, enterprise assets, services and projects.

 Once implemented, we will not only be able to reduce the transaction time for the existing units but also gear up to effectively provide services to the ever-expanding base of software export units coming up in the country, Kumar said.

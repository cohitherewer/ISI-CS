 Dr Reddy?s starts trials for new drug

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 7: Dr Reddy?s Laboratories (DRL) has initiated the first phase of clinical trials for its cardiovascular drug at Belfast in Ireland.

 Clinical trials of RUS 3108, which is a first-in-class compound, will explore its safety levels in humans. 

 This is the first time the company is testing a drug in Europe. RUS 3108 is being developed to treat atherosclerosis, the major cause of cardiovascular disorders such as heart attacks and strokes, a company statement said.

 Dr Reddy?s pointed out that while cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, there are currently no drugs in the market for atherosclerosis.

 The drug works by inducing a protein called perlecan. Company scientists have determined that regulating the expression of perlecan can provide direct protection against this disease.

 Calcutta, May 24: Cargoplan International, the Indian arm of Sri Lankas largest ocean freight forwarder, Freight Links International, is planning to offer specialised services to the tea and plastic industries of the eastern region.

 The company, which has set up its first Indian office in the city, said it would provide the local tea industry a gateway to the CIS countries.

 Moreover, it also plans to take plastics and petrochemical products to China.

 We have almost pioneered tea exports from Sri Lanka to Russia and other CIS countries. We plan to replicate the same here, said Niral Kadawatharatchie, chairman of Freight Links. The company has multimodal linkages in West Asia and other land-locked CIS countries to take tea to interior markets.

 So far, it has touched base with Hindustan Lever Ltd and other small companies for exporting tea. The company is also looking at exporting plastic items from Haldia Petrochemical Ltd and South Asian Petrochemical to China.

 Cargoplan will set up offices in Chennai, Mumbai and Delhi. Eventually, Chennai will become its India headquarters.

 In Delhi and Chennai, the company would primarily focus on garment exports, while in Mumbai it would target furniture and handicrafts.

 The companys India rollout will be completed by the end of this year. Freight Link is looking at about 5,000 TEUs (twenty equivalent units) of cargo in the first full-year of operation.

 In three years, it hopes to rake in $10 million business from India, Kadawatharatchie said. The Indian trade is growing at a phenomenal rate. The market is big and so is the opportunity for us.

 Since many Indian ports cannot take mother vessels due to low draft, Singapore and Colombo have emerged as transhipment ports for the Indian cargo. Hence, Freight Links will be able to provide a vital link to the Indian container cargo.

 Calcutta, Jan. 28: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) will develop its manufacturing prowess through joint ventures. It has identified three telecom factories in Calcutta, Mumbai and Jabalpur where the initiatives will take shape.

 The PSU plans a tie-up with a Chinese firm to manufacture CDMA mobile phones at its telecom factory in Calcutta.

 R. P. Nigam, chief general manager of the factory, said, ?We had invited global tenders for a manufacturing joint venture two months back. Two Chinese companies ? ZTE and Huwaei ? were shortlisted. A final decision is expected before the end of the financial year.?

 ZTE officials have already visited the factory at Alipore and expressed satisfaction at the 1000-sq-metre infrastructure that has been developed for the unit.

 Indian representatives of Huwaei are also expected to visit the site soon.

 Currently, BSNL procures CDMA handsets from LG and Hyundai. ?Once the location is finalised, we expect to start manufacturing by the year-end. We have a target of 1 million sets for the first year.?

 BSNL has chosen the Mumbai unit to manufacture broadband products like ADSL modems and splitters. 

 Splitters enable a broadband user to remain connected to the Internet and use the telephone simultaneously. 

 ?We already have a plan in place for the manufacture of broadband products. Tenders for these will be floated next fiscal,? said Nigam. 

 The company has set a target of signing up 2 million broadband subscribers in 2006 and 3 million in 2007.

 The factory at Jabalpur will be used to manufacture SIM cards, a high-growth area in telecom.

 Towers for mobile communication will also be sought after. ?There is an estimated demand for 10,000 towers in the current year. In October 2003, we were asked to manufacture 4000 to 5000 towers ? a target we could not meet due to in-house constraints,? said Abdul Majid, DDG (Telecom Factory).

 BSNL plans to expand its tower manufacturing capacity from 3000 at present.

 ?We have already started manufacturing towers at our Kharagpur unit,? said Nigam.

 Regarding investments, Nigam said there will be no major fund allocated for the manufacturing plans.

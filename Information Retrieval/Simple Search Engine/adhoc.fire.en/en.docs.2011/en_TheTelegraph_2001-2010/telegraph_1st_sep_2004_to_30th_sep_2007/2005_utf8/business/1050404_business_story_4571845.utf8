 Chandralekha Tulal examines the virtues and vices of cashless medical insurance

 With the spiralling cost of healthcare services, the importance of health insurance policies can hardly be over emphasised. Such risk covers are essential to protect oneself from huge hospital bills that could leave a gaping hole in the pocket.

 The latest trend in health insurance is cashless hospitalisation, which seems to have caught the fancy of many.

 What is cashless hospitalisation all about? It is as simple as this: You walk into a hospital for treatment and all you have to do is fill a form, get admission, receive treatment and walk out after a few days. No deposits, no billing at discharge time and, most important, no tension. The hospital settles the bills with the third party administrator (TPA) of your insurance company.

 You no longer have to think about preserving the medical bills and run to the insurance company for the long-drawn and often harassing process of claim settlement.

 How does the cashless settlement work?

 The TPA ties up numerous hospitals and healthcare providers, which are known as network hospitals, and all hospitalisation services are on cashless basis. 

 On issue of policy, the insurance company supplies all the details to the TPA, which in turn issues an identity card. Anyone under this scheme needs to show the identity card at any network hospital for getting cashless service. The TPA issues an authorisation letter to the hospital, promising to pay for the treatment (other than those excluded in the policy).

 In case of admission to any network hospital, you have to inform the third party administrator. 

 There is also the option to go to any other hospital of one?s choice, but in such cases payment shall be on reimbursement basis.

 It?s the duty of the third party administrator to keep in touch with the hospital. 

 When the patient is discharged, all bills are sent to the TPA, which pays the network hospital after scrutinising the papers. The TPA then sends all the necessary documents, along with the bills, to the insurer for reimbursement.

 Sounds like a dream, but not always. 

 Consumers are still facing problems ranging from delay in receipt of identity cards to hospitals denying treatment despite the fact that they are listed by the TPA on its panel. Then there is the problem of claim settlement by the TPA as also the poor hospital network offered.

 Matthew Verghese, Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority member (non-life), says, ?Complaints received on health insurance are on the decline. Few complaints that we still receive are mostly from eastern India.?

 Nevertheless, both insurance companies and TPAs agree that the main problem lies in the poor response from service providers (network hospitals in this case).

 Patients with a health insurance policy are considered unattractive as it reduces the immediate cash flow of a hospital. 

 Moreover, if a hospital has pending bills with TPAs, they often deny cashless treatment to patients. Insurance companies and TPAs often complain that medical service providers have the tendency to inflate the bills for an insured patient.

 What is reassuring is that service providers are now coming of age. 

 ?Earlier, we faced some problems on claim settlement with the TPA because we did not have much experience. But now, we take care in informing the patients and keeping a track of the allowable treatments and thus, the problems have minimised,? said a spokesperson of Peerless Hospital.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 ?I have given relief to income-tax payers?

I had articulated the UPA government?s principles and our approach to taxation in my budget speech in July 2004. It is the government?s intention to undertake major tax reforms to improve the tax to GDP ratio, expand the tax-payer base, increase tax compliance and make tax administration more efficient.

Customs Duty

 Capital goods: I propose to reduce the peak rate of customs duties for non-agricultural products from 20 per cent to 15 per cent and bring down the customs duty rates on capital goods and raw materials, as well as correct any inverted duty structures. To promote investment, I propose to reduce the customs duties on selected capital goods and parts to below 15 per cent, to 10 per cent in some cases and to 5 per cent in others and reduce the duty for most textile machinery from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, to help the industry acquire a competitive edge in the post-quota regime.

 Similarly, I propose to reduce the duty on refrigerated vans from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, reduce the customs duties on seven specified machinery of the leather and footwear industry from 20 per cent to 5 per cent and reduce the duty on specified parts of battery-operated road vehicles and printing presses from 20 to 10 per cent. I propose to reduce the customs duty on nine specified machinery used in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors to 5 per cent.

 Raw materials: For primary and secondary metals, I propose to reduce customs duties from 15 per cent to 10 per cent. Industrial raw materials such as catalysts, refractory raw materials, basic plastic materials, molasses and industrial ethyl alcohol, which are key inputs to manufacture, will now be liable to a reduced customs duty rate of 10 per cent and lead to 5 per cent. Coking coal with high ash content attracts a duty of 15 per cent. I propose to bring this down to 5 per cent.

 Textiles: Keeping in mind the need to encourage the textile sector, the rates on polyester and nylon chips, textile fibres, yarns and intermediates, fabrics, and garments are proposed to be reduced from 20 per cent to 15 per cent.

 Electronics and telecom: The electronics and telecom sectors merit special attention. On 217 Information Technology Agreement bound items, the duty is required to be brought down to nil. Consequently, to provide a level playing field to domestic industry, I propose to remove customs duty on specified capital goods and all inputs required for the manufacture of ITA bound items.

 However, I intend to take the power to impose a countervailing duty of 4 per cent on all imports to compensate for the state-level taxes, in particular the forthcoming state-level VAT that is proposed to be imposed on corresponding domestic goods. 

 For the present, I propose to levy a CVD of 4 per cent only on the imports of ITA bound items and their inputs that attract nil duty. Credit for the CVD will be available against payment of excise duty. However, because we have a soft corner for these wares, IT software will be exempt from the proposed CVD.

 Agricultural goods: I do not propose to make any changes in the customs duties applicable to agricultural goods. I have decided to increase the duty on cut flowers from 30 per cent to 60 per cent. However, at the request of the trade, and since there is little domestic production, I propose to reduce the duty rate on cloves to 35 per cent. 

 Drinking water: To encourage the import of technology to produce pure drinking water, I propose to reduce the import duty on atmospheric drinking water generators from 20 per cent to 5 per cent.

Excise Duty

 Air conditioners: The government?s intention is to bring as many goods as possible to the Cenvat rate of 16 per cent. Today, five items attract 24 per cent. I have picked out polyester filament yarn, tyres and air conditioners and propose to reduce the excise duty on these to 16 per cent. Manufacturers of motor cars and aerated drinks, the other two items, would have to wait.

 Textiles: Last year, I took a big step forward to prepare the textile industry to meet the challenges of the post-quota regime. I reaffirm that the Cenvat exemption route for natural fibres will remain in force. I propose to give independent texturisers the option to avail of the exemption route or pay 8 per cent excise duty with Cenvat credit.

 Jewellery: Imitation jewellery attracts excise duty of 16 per cent. I propose to reduce the duty to 8 per cent. At the same time, on expensive and premium jewellery manufactured and sold under alluring brand names I propose to levy an excise duty of 2 per cent. There is no levy on unbranded jewellery, including unbranded gold jewellery.

 Tractors: To remove distortions in the tax treatment of comparable products, I propose to levy an excise duty on mosaic tiles at 8 per cent and on road tractors for semi-trailers of engine capacity exceeding 1800 cc at 16 per cent. Agricultural tractors will remain exempt.

 Tea: Some sectors deserve relief as they produce goods for the common citizen. I propose to abolish the surcharge of Re 1 per kg on tea and the excise duty of Re 1 per kg on refined edible oils and Rs 1.25 per kg on vanaspati.

 Matches: Even while protecting the handmade sector that makes matches, it is necessary to give some relief to the mechanised and semi-mechanised sectors. Hence, I propose to reduce the excise duty from 16 per cent to 12 per cent on matches made by these two sectors.

 Small-scale industry: I propose to raise the ceiling for small-scale industry exemption based on turnover from Rs 3 crore per year to Rs 4 crore per year. These units will now have only two options: either full exemption on the first clearance of Rs 1 crore or normal duty on the first clearance of Rs 1 crore with CENVAT credit.

 Iron and steel: I propose to restore the excise duty rate on iron and steel to 16 per cent. This should have little effect on prices because the entire duty is modvatable by most categories of consumers. 

 Molasses: I propose to increase the specific duty on molasses from Rs 500 per MT to Rs 1000 per MT to adjust partially for a hefty increase in molasses prices. I also propose to increase the specific duty on cement clinkers from Rs 250 per MT to Rs 350 per MT as an anti-avoidance measure.

 Highways: To raise additional resources for the National Highways Development Project, I propose to increase the cess on petrol and diesel by 50 paise per litre. The additional resources will be earmarked exclusively for the national highways and a suitable amendment is being proposed to the Central Road Fund Act, 2000.

 Health: What better way is there to fund health care than tax those goods that are health hazards? I, therefore, propose to raise additional resources and allocate the proceeds to finance the National Rural Health Mission. Accordingly, I propose to increase the specific rate on cigarettes by about 10 per cent and impose a surcharge of 10 per cent on ad valorem duties on other tobacco products, including gutka, chewing tobacco, snuff and pan masala. However, bidis will not be subject to this levy.

 Petroleum: Finally, there is the issue of taxes on petroleum products. I propose to make major changes in the customs and excise duty rates. The customs duty on crude petroleum will be reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.

 LPG and kerosene: On LPG for domestic consumption and on subsidised kerosene, the customs duty will be nil. On both products, the excise duty will also be nil.

 Diesel: On other petroleum products, including motor spirit and diesel, I propose to reduce the customs duty from 20 or 15 per cent to 10 per cent. I also propose to fix excise duties on petrol and diesel as a combination of ad valorem and specific duties. I have been assured that there will be no increase in the retail prices of these products as a result.

 Consequent upon the changes in customs and excise duties, the drawback rates for exported goods will be reviewed and modifications, wherever necessary, will be notified by April 30, 2005.

Service Tax

 As the services sector accounts for about 52 per cent of the GDP, it is necessary to cast the net wide. Last July, I raised the rate of service tax to 10 per cent. I propose to maintain that rate.

 I also propose to grant relief to small service providers by exempting those whose gross turnover does not exceed Rs 4 lakh per year. According to my calculation, 80 per cent of the present service tax payers will gain from the exemption.

 I propose to include some additional services in the service tax net. New services to be covered include pipeline transport of goods, site formation, demolition and like services, membership fees of clubs and associations, packaging and specialised mailing services, survey and map making services, dredging services in rivers and harbours, cleaning services for commercial buildings and similar premises, as well as construction of planned residential complexes with more than 12 dwelling units developed by builders.

Direct Taxes

 Last July, as an interim measure, I made a provision under which a person with a taxable income of Rs 100,000 would not be required to pay income tax. About 1.4 crore assessees got relief. I promised to revisit the subject in this budget.

 As part of a major overhaul of direct taxes, I propose to alter the tax brackets after taking due note of the universal demand of members of Parliament and the need to provide stability in the medium term.

 Income slabs: Accordingly, I propose that the new tax brackets and the new rates will be as follows:

Income slab 

 Tax rate

Up to Rs 1 lakh 

 nil

Rs 1-1.5 lakh 

 10 per cent

 Rs 1.5- 2.5 lakh 20 per cent

Above Rs 2.5 lakh 30 per cent

 Further, the level at which the surcharge of 10 per cent will apply will be raised to Rs 10 lakh taxable income. Tax payers in every tax bracket will gain from my proposal.

 Women and aged: Besides, I propose to fix the threshold exemption level for women at Rs 1.25 lakh and the exemption level for senior citizens at Rs 1.5 lakh. These revised exemption levels will be in lieu of the prevailing tax rebate provisions.

 Standard deduction: Given the higher exemption limits and the scaling up of tax brackets, the need for a separate personal allowance does not exist. Therefore I propose to remove the standard deduction. 

Exemptions: There is now a plethora of exemptions. 

Some exemptions are based on the principle of deduction from taxable income and 

some on the principle of tax rebate. I believe the time is ripe to clean up these 

exemptions. At the same time, it is necessary to encourage savings, and tax relief 

is a method to induce people to save. Further, I think that the state must be 

neutral between one form of saving and another and allow the tax payer greater 

flexibility in making savings and investment decisions.

 For these reasons, in addition to the basic exemption limits, I propose to allow every tax payer a consolidated limit of Rs 1 lakh for savings which will be deducted from the income before tax is calculated. All prevailing sectoral caps will be removed. The rebate under Section 88 is being eliminated and Section 80L is being omitted.

 Deductions: In addition to the sum of Rs 1 lakh, the following six deductions will continue to receive the tax treatment that prevails today: interest paid on housing loan for self-occupied house property; medical insurance premia; specified expenditure on disabled dependant; expenses for medical treatment for self or dependant or member of a Hindu undivided family; deduction in respect of interest on loans for pursuing higher studies; and deduction to a person with disability.

 NRIs: Bowing to popular demand, I propose to continue the exemption from tax on interest earned on accounts maintained by Non-Resident Indians.

 Fringe benefits: I have looked into the present system of taxing perquisites and have found that many perquisites are disguised as fringe benefits and escape tax. Neither the employer nor the employee pays tax on these benefits, which are certainly of considerable material value. Where the benefits are fully attributable to the employee they are taxed in the hands of the employee. That will continue.

 I propose that where benefits cannot be attributed to individual employees, they shall be taxed in the hands of the employer. However, transport services for workers and staff and canteen services in an office or factory will be outside the tax net. The rate will be 30 per cent on an appropriately defined base.

 I believe I have given a large measure of relief to personal income tax payers and I hope all sections of people and all members of the House are happy.

Corporate Income Tax

 The corporate income tax rate, the surcharge thereon and the rates of depreciation are inter-linked. Any reform would have to address all three elements. The international best practice is to provide for depreciation at rates that would enable the investor to replace the asset before its economic life ends. In India, in addition to the depreciation rate we have allowed an initial depreciation to encourage new investment.

 Last July, I reduced the condition relating to increase in installed capacity from 25 per cent to 10 per cent.

 I am obliged to keep in mind that several profit making companies continue to pay low tax, even if well within the law, by taking advantage of liberal depreciation rates and of exemptions and incentives. Moreover, current depreciation rates lean towards employing capital rather than labour. There is also a demand that corporate tax should be aligned with the highest marginal personal income tax rate.

 I propose the following tax structure.

 Domestic companies: For domestic companies, the corporate income tax rate will be 30 per cent. There will also be a surcharge of 10 per cent. The rate of depreciation will be 15 per cent for general machinery and plant, but the initial depreciation rate will be increased to 20 per cent.

 As a further measure of relief, I propose to remove the requirement of 10 per cent increase in installed capacity for availing of the benefit of initial depreciation.

 To encourage technological upgradation, I propose to reduce the withholding tax on technical services from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.

 I also propose that credit will be allowed for the Minimum Alternate Tax paid under Section 115 JB of the Income Tax Act.

 Foreign companies: I do not propose to make any changes in the tax regime applicable to foreign companies.

 Last July, I had indicated that I would review the terminal dates on exemptions given for specific purposes. Accordingly, I propose to extend the terminal date, in the following three cases, from March 31, 2005, to March 31, 2007: weighted deduction of 150 per cent of expenditure on in-house research and development facilities of companies engaged in the business of biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, electronics, telecommunication, chemicals or any other notified product; deduction of profits of new industrial undertakings in Jammu amp; Kashmir; 100 per cent deduction of profits of companies carrying on scientific research and development and approved by the department of scientific and industrial research.

Aircraft: In deference to the request from 

Air India and Indian Airlines, I propose to extend up to September 30, 2005, the 

exemption from tax on agreements to acquire aircraft or aircraft engines on lease. 

 Securities transaction: The securities transaction tax has stabilised, but the rates are widely perceived to be too low. I, therefore, propose to make a very nominal increase in the rates for all categories of transactions. Thus, a day trader who is liable to pay the securities transaction tax at 0.015 per cent will now be liable to pay at 0.02 per cent. This small increase should not ruffle anyone?s feathers. This nominal rate of increase will apply to all categories.

 There have been significant developments in the past decade in the capital market, including the introduction of trading in financial derivatives. We have also established a transparent system of trading with adequate safeguards for audit trail. Hence, I propose to amend the Income Tax Act to provide that trading in derivatives in specified stock exchanges will not be treated as speculative transactions for the purposes of the Income Tax Act.

 Returns criteria: I propose to amend the one-in-six criteria for filing income tax returns. Mobile telephones will be removed. Instead, payment for electricity of more than Rs 50,000 per year will be included as a criterion for filing a return of income.

 Withdrawal levy: The NCMP requires the government to introduce special schemes to unearth black money and assets. I am obliged to carry out the mandate, but without giving undeserved relief or an amnesty. I am concerned about large cash transactions, especially withdrawals of cash, when there is no ostensible purpose to withdraw such large amounts of cash. These cash withdrawals leave no trail and presumably become part of the black economy.

 Therefore, I propose to introduce two anti tax-evasion measures: first, I propose to levy a tax on withdrawal of cash on a single day of over Rs 10,000 or more from banks at the rate of 0.1 per cent. Thus, a person withdrawing Rs 10,000 in cash would have to pay a small sum of Rs 10. Second, I propose to require banks to report to the government all deposits that are exempt from TDS on interest. I intend to observe the results of these steps before I propose any further measures.

 Many administrative reforms are underway in the department of revenue. Among them are the tax information network and the on-line tax accounting system.

 As a measure of facilitation, I propose to follow international practice and establish large taxpayer units. To begin with, these will be set up in major cities. I would like to invite large taxpayers, whether of corporate tax or income tax or excise duties or service tax, to participate in the programme and avail of the single window service. For small taxpayers, I propose to set up help centres in cooperation with industry associations, professional bodies and non-government organisations.

 I have decided to accept some suggestions on amendments to the direct tax laws and the indirect tax laws that require to be acted upon immediately, but I do not propose to burden the Finance Bill with those changes. Instead, I intend to introduce a separate bill for that purpose during this session. In due course, I intend to place before Parliament a revised and simplified Income Tax Bill.

 My tax proposals on direct taxes are expected to yield a gain of Rs 6,000 crore. On the indirect taxes side, they are broadly revenue neutral.

 One of India?s proudest sons, Amartya Sen, argues in his book Development as Freedom that development is a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy. He says, ?Growth of GNP or of individual incomes can, of course, be very important as means to expanding the freedoms enjoyed by the members of the society. But freedoms depend also on other determinants, such as social and economic arrangements (for example, facilities for education and health care) as well as political and civil rights.? 

 The UPA government accepts this ethical dimension to the discussion of economic issues, and in this budget I have attempted to reflect that dimension. More or less the same idea was articulated 2,000 years ago by saint Tiruvalluvar who said: ?Pini inmai selvam vilaivu inbam emam, ani enba nattirkku iv iyndhu (Health, wealth, produce, the happiness that is the result, and security ? these five, the learned say, are the ornaments of a polity)?. This budget is an attempt to lay down a path in which growth and equity will reinforce each other and build a new India.

 Jessop revises wages

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 18: Jessop amp; Co today forged a new long-term wage revision agreement with its workers.

 The treaty was signed between the management and two worker unions led by Citu and INTUC.

 The revision, which is applicable immediately, is taking place after six years. 

 The new structure will benefit 900 workers and 450 staff and officers of the company that was divested by the Centre in late 2003.

 This will also lead to a Rs 50-lakh wage bill increase every year for the company.

 A company spokesperson said both basic as well as dearness allowance (DA) will be increased. 

 There will also be substantial increase in LTA and daily meal allowance.

 The new agreement was enforced without government intervention.

 Chairman Pawan K. Ruia said he was confident of Jessops inherent strength and the workforce of the company. 

 Jessop has turned around last year by posting a net profit. The company plans to come out of the BIFR by this year.

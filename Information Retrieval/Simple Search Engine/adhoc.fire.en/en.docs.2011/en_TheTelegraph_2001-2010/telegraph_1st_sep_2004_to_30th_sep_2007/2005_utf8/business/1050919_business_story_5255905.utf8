 Calcutta, Sept. 18: GSM phones and software development will be the two major growth engines for LG in India over the next two to three years.

 The Indian GSM handset market is estimated to be Rs 10,000 crore with around 20 million phones sold annually. The growth is not only due to new additions but also the replacement market, which has grown with the cycle now falling below 12 months. Next year, we have targeted a sales of 1.5 million GSM handsets, said Girish V. Rao, vice-president sales at LG Electronics India Ltd.

 The Korean company is also strengthening its distribution network and handset manufacturing facility to make the country the export hub for the Saarc region, West Asia and Africa. The handset manufacturing plant at Pune is expected to be completely operational by the beginning of next year. The plant has a capacity to make one million phones annually.

 We have more than doubled exports of all products from $40 million last year to $100 million this year, said Rao. 

 After the plant is operational, India will become the export hub for the neighbouring countries, he added.

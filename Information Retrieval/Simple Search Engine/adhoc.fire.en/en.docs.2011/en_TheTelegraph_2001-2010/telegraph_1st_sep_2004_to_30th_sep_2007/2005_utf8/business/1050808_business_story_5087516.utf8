 Calcutta, Aug. 7: Numeric Power Systems, the countrys largest UPS systems manufacturer, is setting up a manufacturing facility in the city to grab the business opportunities emerging from the growing information technology sector in Bengal and other eastern states.

 Till now, the company has production facilities only in the south and it enjoys 20 per cent share of the Indian market. 

 However, the booming IT sector in the eastern region is drawing the company to the city. 

 R. Chellappan, managing director, Numeric Power Systems, said, We want to have a presence in the heart of the business, which is set to explode.

 To begin with, the company is setting up an assembly unit having a capacity of 15-20,000 KVA (kilovolt ampere). It is looking at the plug--play infrastructure in the Salt Lake area, which has the largest concentration of IT companies in the state.

 We hope to start operations by October this year, Chellappan said.

 The eastern unit will be catering to the eastern and the northeast states. Even though it has an elaborate pan-India marketing network, the company felt it could have done better if it has a manufacturing presence here.

 Numerics market share in the eastern region is only 14 per cent, much below its all-India figure. With the new unit in place, the company hopes to consolidate its position in the eastern part of the country.

 The company has seven manufacturing units, three each in Pondicherry and Chennai and one in Colombo in Sri Lanka.

 The city unit will, however, procure key raw materials from Chennai and will assemble them here. 

 In order to serve the northern market, it is also setting up a unit in Himachal Pradesh.

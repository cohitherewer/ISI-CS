 UK aid for Rover staff

 Damage control

 Longbridge, England, April 

 15 (Reuters): Tony Blair?s Labour government offered 

 workers and suppliers at collapsed carmaker MG Rover ?150 

 million ($283 million) in aid, seeking to limit the damage 

 from up to 5,000 job losses as it seeks re-election.

 Administrators said on Friday there was no hope of selling the last major British carmaker in one piece, and just under 5,000 workers would be made redundant immediately, dealing a blow to the ruling Labour party?s image of economic competence.

 ?This is a desperate time for the workforce at Longbridge and their families. There is no point in me trying to pretend we can put together some magic deal to get another company to come in and take it over,? Blair told reporters in Birmingham in central England, not far from MG Rover?s Longbridge plant.

 Blair, campaigning on the back of his economic record for re-election on May 5, said the aid would include redundancy payments, job training and site redevelopment.

 The 100-year-old carmaker, which once made the iconic Mini and the Land Rover, stopped production last week after failing to secure a rescue deal with China?s Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp (SAIC).

 Administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) said they would ?mothball? the MG Rover plant over the next two months, effectively locking it up as they seek buyers for its assets.

 ?It has hit me like a brick. It?s three quarters of my life in this place. It?s a very sad day for British motoring,? Gordon Lane, 52, who has worked for the company for 29 years, said outside the Longbridge plant.

 Most of the firm?s 6,000 workforce will lose their jobs. Some staff will be retained to complete part-finished cars, along with staff at its engine-making division and MGF sports-car unit, which could still be sold to a third party.

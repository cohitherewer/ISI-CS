 BG wants gas deal tied up by April 1

 New Delhi, Feb. 4: British Gas (BG) has set an April 1 deadline for the petroleum ministry to ensure a higher price for the natural gas being produced from the ONGC-discovered Tapti and Panna-Mukta fields. If the ministry fails to meet the deadline, it would divert the gas to new buyers who are willing to pay more.

 Petroleum secretary S. C. Tripathi told The Telegraph that the production-sharing contract signed at the time of the privatisation of these fields in the mid-nineties provides for a formula to calculate the price of the gas. BG is now leveraging this formula to work out the new price. He said the government would go by the legal provisions in the case. Tripathi also said the government was trying to work out a way by which the existing gas supplies to power plants and fertiliser units are maintained.

 The hastily drawn up contract for the privatisation of these fields in the mid-nineties was signed during the Narasimha Rao regime when Satish Sharma was the petroleum minister.

 Sources say Gail (India) Ltd, which transports the gas, has informed the petroleum ministry that the current market price of the gas should range between $3.1 and $3.6 per million British thermal units (Btu). BG, however, is insisting on a price of $4.5 to $5.6 per million Btu. 

 BG has put the government in a dilemma by demanding what appears to be an ?exorbitant price? for the 10 to 12 million standard cubic metres per day of natural gas that is supplied from these fields to the vital power and fertiliser units and some private companies as well. Interestingly, natural gas to the users has been allocated by the government itself. Both the power plants and fertiliser units sell their output at regulated prices and hence cannot afford to pay such a high price for the gas.

 If the BG decision has to be implemented, the country will either have to do without the 3,000 MW of power and 9 million tonnes of urea produced from the gas supplied by these fields or else the government will end up shouldering a massive subsidy burden.

 Currently, natural gas from other ONGC and OIL fields in the country is being supplied at $2.5 per million Btu and even liquefied natural gas that is being imported from Qatar at the Dahej terminal in Gujarat by Petronet LNG is being sold at $4.1 per million Btu. 

 BG had moved into these ONGC-discovered western offshore fields by acquiring a 30 per cent stake from Enron Corporation for $350 million.

 Reliance Industries, which had initially brought in Enron as part of the consortium that took over the fields from ONGC for a song, owns 30 per cent. ONGC has been left with a 40 per cent share, which will now prove crucial. Reliance Industries, which also stands to gain from a higher price, is expected to play along with its British partner.

 ONGC had run into serious problems with BG after it acquired the Enron share because the British firm wanted to take over as the operator of the fields. However, ONGC had stuck to its guns and a system of joint operatorship was put in place, which lets all the partners have a say in the management of the venture.

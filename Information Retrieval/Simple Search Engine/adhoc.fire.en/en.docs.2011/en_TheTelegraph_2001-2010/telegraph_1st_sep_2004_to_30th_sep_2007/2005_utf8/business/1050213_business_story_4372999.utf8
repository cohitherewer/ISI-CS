 Cruise shipping policy ready to set sail

 Bon voyage 

 Mumbai, Feb. 12 (PTI): The Union shipping ministry is planning to formulate a cruise shipping policy to make India an attractive cruise tourism destination with state-of-the-art infrastructure and other facilities at selected ports of the country.

 ?The government has set up a steering group under the shipping ministry with the Union minister of state for tourism as co-chairperson on formulating a comprehensive cruise shipping policy,? Union shipping minister T. R. Baalu told reporters here today on the sidelines of a cruise shipping workshop.

 He said hurdles to the development of a cruise shipping policy have already been identified by a working group and views of all stakeholders would be taken into account while formulating the policy.

 Baalu said the ministry would seek budgetary support to create the necessary infrastructure at select major ports and investment would be done on a case-to-case basis.

 ?We have identified six major ports for the Indian cruise shipping circuit, including Mumbai, Mormugao, New Mangalore, Kochi, Tuticorin and Chennai in the first phase. The Calcutta port and minor ports like Porbander and Port Blair will be added in the second phase,? he said.

 Baalu said the policy would be finalised after discussing with the ministries of tourism, railways and civil aviation and action plans would be executed in two years.

 Speaking at the workshop, shipping secretary D. T. Joseph said Indian shipping companies must explore having own cruise ships to tap the vast potential of Indian tourist spots and increasing cruise passengers.

 ?While inviting foreign cruise liners to the country, India should try to launch its own cruise shipping system by making use of its seafarers, vessels, heritage spots and skills,? he said.

 Joseph asked the Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) to explore possibilities of exploring Indian cruise opportunities and thereby channeling back the benefits enjoyed i n the booming freight market.

 Mumbai Port Trust (MBPT) chairperson Rani Jhadav said over 18 foreign cruise liners have registered during 2004-05 at the port, including Queen Elizabeth, Ida Cara, Aurora and Star Princess.

 Shipping ministry joint secretary Sushil Kumar said, long-term plans are being worked out on connectivity issues of road, rail, air and inland waterways for promoting cruise shipping.

 ?The government is also working out duty-free bunkers for coastal leg of cruise shipping routes with a special package of tax incentives for passenger ship operators and owners,? he added.

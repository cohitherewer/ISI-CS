The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 AllBank public offer oversold 9 times

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 12: Allahabad Bank?s public offer, which closed today, was oversubscribed 9.01 times.

 Data being compiled late tonight showed cumulative bids received at National and Bombay stock exchanges at 90 crore shares against the issue size of 10 crore.

 The qualified institutional buyers (QIBs) segment was oversubscribed 18.3 times. The non-QIB segment was oversubscribed eight times and the retail segment was oversold 2.07 times. These subscriptions came in at the upper end of the Rs 75-82 price band. 

 The response to the issue is being seen as a positive signal for other public sector banks like Bank of India and Bank of Baroda, which have lined up similar flotations in the near future.

 However, the reaction to Allahabad Bank was lukewarm when measured against the Punjab National Bank (PNB) public offer, which was oversubscribed 16 times.

 However, market sources are of the view that such a response in the context of the current market volatility is still encouraging.

 ?Despite the choppy market, the response to the issue was quite good,? said S. Mukherji, managing director and chief executive officer of ICICI Securities, one of the lead managers to the issue.

 The offer opened on April 6 and was oversold more than three times on day one; most of the bids are believed to have come at the upper end of the band.

 Of the total offer, the bank had reserved 1 crore shares for its employees and an equal number for existing retail shareholders.

 Of the 8 crore shares that were left, 4 crore was set aside for QIBs and 1.2 crore shares for non-institutional buyers. The balance 2.8 crore was earmarked for retail investors on a proportionate basis. On the day the issue opened, the price of AllBank shares fell to Rs 92.55. It recovered to Rs 93.75 on April 8 but again declined to Rs 87.6 today. 

 Money raised from the issue will be used to increase the capital base of the bank and meet requirements arising out of the implementation of the Basel II standards. 

 The proceeds will also be utilised for general corporate purposes, including development of infrastructure to support business growth and service customers, besides meeting the issue expenses.

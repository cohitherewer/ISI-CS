 Tatas in tieup talks to offer branded handsets

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, May 14: Tata Teleservices (TTSL) plans to introduce CDMA mobile handsets under the Tata brand and is in talks with two manufacturers in Korea and the US.

 Sources said the matter was discussed at an internal meeting two months back. There was a proposal to bundle a self-branded handset with the mobile service. Such a step is being considered for the first time in India.

 Till now, CDMA service operators have offered co-branded handsets to customers. 

 The company refused to reveal the names of the shortlisted manufacturers but said they were major players in the CDMA segment.

 Sources, however, confirmed that the company had worked on the basic features, design and specifications. Only the manufacturing would be outsourced to a third party.

 The proposal of a self-branded handset was mooted after TTSL faced problems with handset delivery in some of the new circles where it had started operations. The company wanted to minimise dependence on handset vendors and have its own branded phones, which will help it become a complete mobile solution provider.

 With Nokia adopting the open distribution system on the lines of its GSM phones, TTSL currently sources phones from Kyocera, Motorola and LG. The company is also in talks with Haier for a tie-up.

 Since its launch in January, TTSL has acquired 85,000 subscribers and will cross the 1 lakh-mark very soon.

 Regarding marketing initiatives, chief operating officer (eastern hub) Rajesh Puri said, Till now, we focused on the pre-paid segment in mobile phones and post-paid in the Walky or land phone category. After consolidating our position, we will try to acquire customers in the post-paid category in mobiles and pre-paid in land phones.

 TTSL will strengthen its customer service and has already set up 1000 True Value shops in the 20 circles where it is operational. Of this 160 are in Calcutta. Puri, however, felt that the rate of customer acquisition should be boosted as there is a great potential for market expansion.

 We clock an average of 1200-1300 connections everyday in Calcutta against 2000-2500 connections in the older circles like Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, he added.

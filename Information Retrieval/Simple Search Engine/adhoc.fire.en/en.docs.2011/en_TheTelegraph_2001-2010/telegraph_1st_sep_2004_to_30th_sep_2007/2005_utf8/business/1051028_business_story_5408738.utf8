 Purwar: Taking stock

 Mumbai, Oct. 27: The State Bank of India (SBI) has posted a 12.12 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 1215.36 crore for the quarter ended September 30 compared with Rs 1083.89 crore in the same period last year. The lower-than-expected profit was due to a fall in income on investments.

 However, the net interest income (the difference between borrowing costs and that earned from lending) grew to Rs 3607.95 crore from Rs 3379 crore in the same period last year. For the first half, the bank?s core income went up by 24 per cent to Rs 7861.19 crore from Rs 6333.89 crore.

 SBI said despite a lower profit on investment sales, the growth in net profit was achieved due to higher net interest income and lower provisions required for non-performing assets (NPAs) during the half year. The bank has posted a net profit of Rs 2438.19 crore for the first half compared with Rs 2140.29 crore last year, a growth of around 14 per cent.

 Operating profit of the bank for the half year at Rs 5422.40 crore was 16 per cent higher from Rs 4676.31 crore last year. According to SBI, the net interest margin also improved to 3.44 per cent in the half-yearly period ended September 30 against 3.15 per cent in the first half of last year.

 Income on investments during the quarter came down to Rs 3611.09 crore from Rs 4164.08 crore last year. While staff cost registered a growth of over 9 per cent because of wage revision, total provisions made for the half year were higher at Rs 2984.21 crore (Rs 2536.02 crore).

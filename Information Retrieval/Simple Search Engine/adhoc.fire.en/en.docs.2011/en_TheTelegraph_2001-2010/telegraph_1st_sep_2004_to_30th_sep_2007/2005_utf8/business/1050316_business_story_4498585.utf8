 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mallya: All?s well that ends well

 Mumbai, March 15: The UB group, headed by Vijay Mallya, today got full control of Herbertsons Ltd when Phipson Distillery, a 100 per cent subsidiary of McDowell?s, acquired over 49 per cent stake for over Rs 131 crore.

 The purchase was sealed through a block deal of 46 lakh shares of Herbertsons on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The shares were sold by the Kishore Chhabria group of companies ? Stingray Traders, Shirish Finance amp; Investment, Darrel Traders, Algid Investment and Finance, Veneer Investment amp; Finance, Mahameru Trading, Beethoven Traders, Airedale Investment amp; Traders and IMFA Holdings. 

 Phipson Distillery bought the shares at Rs 280.73 apiece, entailing a total cost of Rs 131 crore. With this transaction, the holding of the UB group in Herbertsons will increase to over 92 per cent.

 On the BSE today, the Herbertsons scrip was in high spirits as it finished at Rs 370, after opening at Rs 280.70.

 Earlier this month, a decade-old battle for control of Herbertsons Ltd between Vijay Mallya and Kishore Chhabria came to an end after the Supreme Court approved their final settlement deed submitted during the proceedings.

 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) had also given its approval to the agreement between Mallya and Chhabria.

 Under the terms of the settlement, the UB group will buy 46,72,791 shares in Herbertsons owned by entities controlled by Kishore Chhabria and his uncle M. D. Chhabria for a consideration of Rs 131.16 crore.

 The Supreme Court approval to the deal came after both sides informed the court that they had reached a settlement, which had the consent of the market regulator.

 The agreement deed was submitted to a bench of Justices N. Santosh Hegde, S. B. Sinha and B. N. Srikrishna, which took it on record, and disposed of the case according to the terms of the agreement approved by Sebi.

 Under the agreement, the stock transaction would have to be put through a registered member of a recognised stock exchange appointed jointly by Mallya and Chhabria.

 Subsequently, UB disclosed that it had deposited Rs 131.16 crore in an escrow account with Kanga and Company, advocates and solicitors, and that Kishore Chhabria and his companies have also deposited their 49.06 per cent shares with Kanga and Company in the escrow account.

 The completion of this deal, will clear the path for the UB group to synergise all its spirits businesses under one roof. 

 Senior UB group officials have recently said that a new entity called United Spirits Ltd will be formed, which will be a combination of McDowell, Herbertsons and Triumph Distillers.

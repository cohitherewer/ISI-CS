The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

There?s a lot to cheer about

Broad View / Renu Sud Karnad

Finance minister P. Chidambaram has retained the tax 

exemption under section 24 for interest payment on housing which is significant 

as housing generates a lot of employment and boosts other sectors like cement 

and steel. 

Also, the personal income tax slabs have been revised 

where incomes of up to Rs 1 lakh will not be subject to tax, which will benefit 

over 1.4 crore assesses and savings will be encouraged with the introduction of 

a consolidated deduction of up to Rs 1 lakh.

However, by removing the deduction under section 80L 

the depositor will be negatively impacted.

A positive for the financial sector is the proposal 

for the development of the corporate bond market with plans to provide a legal 

framework for trading in securitised debt, including mortgage-backed securities. 

It is incorporated under the SCRA, thereby increasing liquidity for these instruments 

and the appointment of a high-level expert committee to look into its development.

Another important aspect of this budget is the thrust 

given to the infrastructure sector with the formation of the Special Purpose Vehicle 

and viability gap funding for infrastructure projects. 

Additional funds for infrastructure will be made available 

through the utilisation of a part of the foreign exchange reserves.

The budget focuses on Mumbai and seeks to give it 

a makeover by increasing the outlay for The Mumbai Metro Rail Project, the Mumbai 

Trans Harbour Link and the Mumbai Western Expressway Sealink. The finance minister 

also promises to develop Mumbai as a regional financial sector.

On the negative side, the levy of service tax on construction 

of residential complexes will increase the property prices when passed on to the 

buyers.

Lastly, one of the key emphasis of the budget has 

been on enhancing micro-finance and rural infrastructure.

 Work resumes at Honda factory

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: Bringing an end to the month-long labour row, Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India Ltd, the Japanese two-wheeler major, resumed operations today.

 It will, however, take a couple of days more for the company to run on maximum production capacity. 

 Honda Motorcycle has a production facility at Manesar on the outskirts of Gurgaon in Haryana. The peak production of this plant is 2,000 units a day. Against this, the factory is currently managing to roll out only about 800-900 vehicles a day.

 A month ago, when the labour trouble started, production had gone down to as low as 250 units a day. The production of motorbikes was suspended following a massive labour agitation, demanding higher wages. We hope to re-start production of bikes by tomorrow, said a senior Honda official, adding, things have to be synchronised, even the raw material purchases. 

 The company has suffered losses in excess of Rs 150 crore due to the drastic cut in production. In addition, it is also facing difficulties in meeting demands from dealers. 

 The company operates in three shifts and its officials have confirmed that nearly 800 workers have resumed work in the first shift. An equal number is expected in the second shift as well, they said. 

 Most of the production takes place in the first two shifts. The factory has a headcount of 2,500 employees.

 According to the row-settlement agreement, brokered by Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda, the company had agreed to take in four dismissed and 50 suspended workers.

 It is believed that the company will also not make any fresh demands for a period of one-year.

 On the other hand, workers will not get wages for the period they were on strike. 

 The dismissed employees reportedly have given a separate assurance letter to the management, apart from the undertaking that all agitators signed before resuming duty.

 In a statement issued last week, the company said the management has agreed to resolve the situation considering the welfare of the workers and the states industrial growth.

 Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India reported a turnover of approximately Rs 1,700 crore in fiscal 2004-05, posting sales of 5,50,000 units. This year the company is targeting an overall sales of 8 lakh units.

 Deposits key to co-op bank status

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 4: Urban co-operative banks (UCBs) with deposits of over Rs 50 crore should be treated on a par with commercial banks for the purpose of regulation and supervision, the RBI said in its draft vision document for UCBs. 

 RBI feels banks having one branch with deposits of less than Rs 50 crore should be subjected to simpler regulatory and supervisory requirements.

 The document, which is seeking public feedback, was released by the RBI here today.

 The RBI said unit banks, especially the smaller among them, capture the basic concept and spirit of co-operative banking since they function from a single branch and cater to the clientele in and around their place of business. 

 Such banks may be given an additional three years to classify non-performing assets based on the 90-day delinquency norm.

 However, they will be required to build adequate provisions during this period to change to the 90-day norm at the end of three years.

 ?Since small unit banks with deposits below Rs 50 crore epitomise the basic tenets of cooperative banking, less stringent regulations could be considered for them,? the report said. 

 Capital adequacy ratio (CRAR) could be replaced by the simpler form of minimum capital requirement (net-owned funds to NDTL ratio) which is easier to compute for the small banks. 

 At the same time, keeping in view their ability to assess and absorb risks, appropriate limitations like a lower level of single and group exposure limit could be prescribed for these banks to contain their concentration risk. 

 The paper proposes setting up of a state-level task force on co-operative urban banks.

 The central bank will also explore other states, where bank licence applications are pending with the RBI.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Cup of joy for tea overflows

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

Calcutta, Feb. 28: The Indian tea industry. has heaved a sigh of relief. 

 In Budget 2005-06, finance minister P. Chidambaram has removed the additional excise duty (AED) of Re 1 per kg of made tea. The industry has been clamouring for this relief for the last two years.

 The AED of Re 1 per kg of made tea was imposed by Jaswant Singh in the Union Budget 2002-03.

 An ecstatic C. K. Dhanuka, chairman of the Indian Tea Association, said: ?We are extremely happy about the abolition of the AED. It has been a long-standing demand of the industry.?

 The abolition of AED will also help the tea-drinking population of the country. The prices of tea will not go up and may, in fact, be slashed. An expert committee will be set up to suggest measures to improve the price stabilisation fund for the plantation sector.

 While presenting the budget, Chidambaram said: ?I am aware of the difficulties that the plantation sector has faced for some years now. While the prices of commodities such as tea and coffee have shown some improvement, the sector still faces difficulties. The price stabilisation fund has not proved very effective or popular.?

 He said: ?In the case of tea, our comparative advantage has been eroded largely because of the declining productivity of tea. Government will examine ways and means of introducing a programme for massive replantation and rejuvenation. Suresh Bansal, president of the Tea Association of India welcomed the move for creating a special purpose fund for replantation and rejuvenation in order to increase land productivity.

 Turning a new leaf 

In September 2004, commerce minister Kamal Nath had 

announced to set up a fund which will be spend over a period of 15 years for replantation 

and rejuvenation of the tea bushes. But the corpus has not yet been set up. 

 The Consultative Committee of Plantation Associations also welcomed the proposals in the budget relating to accelerated development of railway and highway infrastructure in the North east and the specific allocations made in the budget towards addressing the problems of flood damage afflicting the region. 

 Vinay Goenka, executive chairman of Warren Tea said that the reduction in corporate tax from 35 per cent to 30 per cent is also a relief to the tea industry. He said that as most of the tea companies will be carrying forward losses, the reduction in corporate tax to 30 per cent is welcome. 

 However, the industry is upset over the finance minister?s decision to impose tax on withdrawal of more than Rs 10,000 per day in cash which will create difficulties in matters of labour wage and bonus disbursements.

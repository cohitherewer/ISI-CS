 Purnendu stirs Haldia debt fears

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, July 26: The Bengal government is balking at Purnendu Chatterjee?s plan to buy its stake in Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) through a leveraged buyout.

 Sources at Writers? Buildings said the authorities are wary of such a move because it will saddle the company with a lot of debt, a burden that has just been reduced through a loan recast. The rejig has brought down its debt-equity ratio, which was 1:4.5 before the process started but is hovering around 1:1.5 now.

 Misgivings over leveraged buyout have prompted the state government to ask L. B. Jha amp; Company to examine Purnendu?s stake-purchase proposal ahead of Haldia Petrochemicals? board meeting slated for July 29.

 In a leveraged buyout, the acquiring entity borrows money to buy a company, using the assets of the latter as security. The loan is usually more than 70 per cent of the purchase value.

 Officials of the state commerce and industry department today held talks with HPL chairman Tarun Das on Purnendu?s method of buying out the government?s 36.87 per cent stake.

 ?We do not know what a leveraged buyout is. We are only interested in the well-being of HPL. We will not allow anything that affects its financial health. If Purnendu wants our stake, he should put the cheque on the table. We will not wait for an indefinite period for him,? state commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said.

 The Chatterjee Group chief has to shell out Rs 1,560 crore for the shares to the government, which wants him to fork out Rs 30 apiece. The two sides have now agreed that the figure should be between Rs 28.50 and Rs 29. 

 Deutsche Bank is helping Purnendu in the deal. The TCG chief has written to the state government that he has already opened an escrow account of Rs 1,160 crore with the bank for the proposed acquisition. The remaining Rs 400 crore will come from him.

 Sources say the Indian Oil Corporation?s interest in HPL also figured in the talks the state top brass had with Das. ?We are hoping that the government will issue shares against our contribution of Rs 150 crore. We can only acquire the government?s stake after Purnendu?s refusal,? senior officials of the petroleum major said.

 Purnendu said he did not know of the July 31 deadline that the state has set for him. ?I am not aware of a deadline. I am reading about it in the media. I cannot comment when the deal will be clinched. I am rather confused right now,? he told The Telegraph from Mumbai.

 The TCG chief held several rounds of discussions with banks and financial institutions to get their support at the board meeting of HPL on Friday. 

 The total equity size of HPL is Rs 1,410 crore. Of this, Bengal holds 36.87 per cent (Rs 520 crore), The Chatterjee Petrochem Mauritius 30.7 per cent (Rs 433 crore), The Chatterjee Petrochem India 10.99 per cent (Rs 155 crore) and the Tatas 3.19 per cent (Rs 45 crore).

 Mitsubishi Motors lowers loss

 Tokyo, Aug. 2 (Reuters): Japans Mitsubishi Motors Corp (MMC) said its quarterly net loss shrank by more than 60 per cent ? better than it had anticipated, thanks to falling sales costs and currency tailwinds ? but it kept its forecast for an improved full-year result.

 Suzuki Motor, Japans fourth-biggest auto maker and the worlds third-biggest motorcycle maker, also reported healthier earnings, with a 4.6 per cent rise in April-June operating profit as it braved bigger investment spending to expand capacity. 

 MMC ? in the throes of rebuilding itself from a crisis that led to a multi-billion-dollar bail-out last year ? is targeting a return to profitability next business year and stable profits in 2007-08, after a weakened brand led to a sharp slowdown in Japanese and US sales last year.

 Domestic rivals such as Nissan Motor and Honda Motor, meanwhile, continue to charge ahead, reporting higher operating profit for the past quarter thanks to healthy US and Japanese sales.

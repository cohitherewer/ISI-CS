 New twist to Birla case

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 9: Counsel for S. N. Prasad, co-accused in the criminal case along with Rajendra Singh Lodha, today turned the heat on Rajendra Prasad Pansari and accused him of criminal breach of trust. 

 Seeking quashing of the criminal proceedings against Lodha, Prasad, V. Gourishankar and S. K. Daga, Prasad?s counsel Shanti Bhushan refuted the charges levelled by Pansari, who accused Lodha of masterminding dissolution of five charitable trusts for personal gains. He also countered Ram Jethmalani?s argument that the trusts were irrevocable and Lodha committed a fraud by dissolving the trusts. 

 Shanti Bhushan contented that in case the accusations against Lodha and three others were true, then Pansari was also guilty of criminal breach of trust. Elaborating on his argument, the Supreme Court lawyer mentioned that Pansari, who was a secretary of the trusts, was a witness when Priyamvada Birla made the nominations for the assets of the MP Birla group. 

 But just two days after the nominations were made, Priyamvada Birla wrote to the board of East India Investments ? an investment outfit of the MP Birla group ? to transfer shares held in the name of M. P. Birla to her. Pansari, who was a director of the investment arm of the group, approved the transfer at the board meeting. Summing up his argument in the court of Justice P. N. Sinha, Shanti Bhushan said Pansari committed a criminal breach of trust by allowing a transfer of shares meant for the trusts.

 Earlier in the day, the application of Laxmi Devi Newar and Radha Devi Mohatta, sisters of late M. P. Birla, for appointment of a receiver and valuer for the household assets at the couple?s residences in Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai and Allahabad came up for hearing before Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta. He asked Lodha to find out the existence of these assets and inform the status to the Court by March 11, 2005, when the application will be heard again.

 GM rating in reverse gear

 In slow motion

 Detroit, April 6 (Reuters): Moodys Investors Service has cut General Motors Corp?s (GM) debt rating to a step above junk status, citing the world?s largest automaker?s profit warning last month, and cautioned that it may downgrade rival Ford Motor Co.

 The companies? shares were little changed, but both automakers? bonds weakened compared with treasuries. About $375 billion of debt by Ford, GM and their subsidiaries are affected.

 GM said last month that it will post its weakest first-quarter earnings since 1992, and profits this year could fall as much as 80 per cent below its previous forecast. GM has said it is grappling with soaring employee healthcare costs and falling market share.

 GM?s US sales have fallen 5.1 per cent through the first three months of 2005 from a year ago, as its market share has tumbled to 25.6 per cent from about 27.3 per cent for all of 2004.

 ?GM clearly has no margin for error now,? said Brian Ropp, auto credit analyst at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, which owns both Ford and GM bonds.

 A downgrade below investment-grade by even one ratings agency could boost GM?s borrowing costs and wreak havoc in the corporate bond market. Billions of dollars worth of GM bonds would have to move from investment-grade investors to hedge funds and junk bond managers.

 The company is rated just one step above junk, with a negative outlook, by all three major credit ratings agencies, although Moody?s still rates GM?s finance subsidiary, General Motors Acceptance Corp at two steps above junk.

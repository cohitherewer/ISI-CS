 Registrar of companies springs Reliance posers

 OUR BUREAU 

 New Delhi, May 19: The government has asked the registrar of companies (RoC) to issue a notice to the Reliance group on complaints filed against it by Anil Ambani.

 We have asked the RoC to issue a notice to Reliance, company affairs secretary Komal Anand told reporters on the sidelines of a conference here. 

 Anand, however, did not elaborate on the details of the notice to be served by RoC, which is under the administrative control of her ministry.

 She was replying to questions on steps taken by the government on complaints made by Anil on the issue. 

 Earlier, Sebi had said it would examine the corporate governance issues in Reliance Industries in the broader interest of investors. 

 We have received several letters from Anil on this issue.....and are doing everything to protect the interest of the investors, quot; Sebi chief M. Damodaran had said. 

 Anil is caught in a highly publicised tussle with elder brother Mukesh over the way the Rs 85,000-crore Reliance empire is run. Although Anand refused to divulge details of Anils complaints, it is widely known that the younger Ambani had raised issues of corporate governance and disclosure norms in the group over the last few months.

 Anil and his lieutenant, Amitabh Jhunjhunwala, have raised several issues, including the sale of IPCLs equity by Reliance Capital ? a company that may come to the younger Ambani as part of a settlement between the two brothers ? without making disclosures to Sebi. 

 Anil went to the extent of not signing the annual accounts of RIL on April 27 and later pulled cousin Nikhil Meswani into the crossfire by asserting that he was not involved in a settlement between the brothers and, in many ways, had been misleading the media on it.

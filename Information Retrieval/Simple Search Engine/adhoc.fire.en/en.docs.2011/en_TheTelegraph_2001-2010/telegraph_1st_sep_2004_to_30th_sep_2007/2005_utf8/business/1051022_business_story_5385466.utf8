 Pull-back after drop-down

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, Oct. 21: Spurred by a rush for shortcovering and fresh FII buying, the sensex today staged a strong pull-back rally of 134 points to close at 8068.95, snapping a six-session losing streak and perking up sagging investor confidence.

 Market sentiment got a boost from the governments assurance that financial sector reforms would be given top priority with moderate and reasonable tax rates for industry.

 The sensex initially witnessed some volatility but later rose to an intra-day high of 8080.77, before closing the day at 8068.95 against Thursdays finish of 7935.12, a net rise of 133.83 points or 1.69 per cent.

 The sensex has fallen 605 points, or 7.09 per cent, in six sessions since October 13.

 The market had virtually bottomed out from the resistance level of 7850-7900, attracting new bargain-hunters ahead of the RBIs busy season monetary and credit policy on October 25 and expiry of derivatives contracts next week.

 Operators and foreign institutional investors (FIIs) made fairly heavy purchases in a bid to cover short positions in the futures segment, brokers said.

 FIIs have been heavy sellers in the past couple of weeks due to a weak rupee and signs of measured hikes in US rates.

 With todays relief rally, investors expect the market to stabilise at current levels./ Some even expect it to gain further .

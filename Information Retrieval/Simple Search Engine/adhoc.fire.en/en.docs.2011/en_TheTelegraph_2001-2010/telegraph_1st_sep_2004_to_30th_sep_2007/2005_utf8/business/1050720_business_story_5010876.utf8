 Mid-air collision on aviation fuel tax

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Ground reality 

 New Delhi, July 19: The civil aviation ministry has written to the finance ministry seeking a cap of 4 per cent on air turbine fuel tax while demanding a deemed status for the fuel sold to state run carriers for their foreign flights. 

 However, North Block seems in no mood to pay heed to the civil aviation ministrys plea as it feels it may end up losing up revenues on this count. 

 The civil aviation ministry as well as the petroleum ministry are incensed at finance ministrys refusal till date to extend the deemed export status to fuel sold to Indian Airlines, Air-India and other private Indian carriers for international flights. 

 The deemed export status exempts fuel sold to such airlines from central sales tax. The two ministries point out that the government has already extended such facilities to foreign airlines refuelling in India. It does not make sense not to give the same treatment to our airlines, officials said. As a result, airlines in India flying abroad tank up when they reach a foreign airport. 

 The aviation ministry, on its part, also points out that turbine fuel sold to turbo prop aircraft has already been categorised as declared goods, meaning it can be taxed only once. The cap on tax on ATF sold to these aircraft stands at 4 per cent and the ministry consequently wants this tax regime to be extended to jet aircraft too. 

 However, the problem withthis argument is that this facility for turbo-props was extended during the previous BJP regime in a bid to reduce the cost of travel to remote destinations in the Northeast to be serviced by these turbo-props. 

 Sources said while all airlines favoured reduction in ATF prices, low cost carriers like Deccan Air and Spice Jet would be the ones that would derive the maximum benefit from such a move as their profit margins were the lowest on any given route.

 The move of course needs the acceptance of state governments, most of whom charge high sales tax on ATF. Officials said it was unlikely that all of them would agree to such a measure though many states, which were not well connected by air services, were keen to agree to this if it meant more flights.

 Turbine fuel costs constituted about a third of the total costs of an airline in India compared with an average of 16-18 per cent globally, mainly on account of the high rate of taxes in the country. Increase in ATF prices by over 60 per cent has added Rs 600 crore alone to the fuel costs of airlines in the last financial year.

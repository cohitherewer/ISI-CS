 Rush to meet infotech act deadline

 New Delhi, July 13: The department of information technology is burning the midnight oil to meet a mid-July deadline set by the government for submission of a draft IT act.

 The draft is expected to plug loopholes in the existing IT Act 2000, such as the lack of a legal basis for enforcing data privacy.

 Sources in the IT department said, The whole world is grappling with data protection and India is no exception. Business process outsourcing units in India have emerged as significant players in the global market and we have to be cautious in our final inputs. 

 Sources said the data protection clauses took up a considerable time while finalising the draft along with issues like penalties and regulation of new technologies.

 Concern over data protection issues have acquired an urgency after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh asked the department to build guidelines into the IT act that make cyber crime a punishable offence.

 Singh said this in the context of the controversy over alleged sale of confidential credit card, health and passport data by an Indian BPO worker Karan Bahree to a Sun undercover reporter.

 Singh chaired a special meeting to review steps taken by the government and by industry to deal with the challenges of cyber crime, soon after the Bahree episode. 

 A committee set up by communications minister Dayanidhi Maran early this year to review the IT Act was supposed to submit its report on May 30. However, the committee sought more time and was given June 30 as an extended deadline. But it could not place the draft even by the new deadline. 

 Consequently, Maran, directed his officials to submit the report by July 15.

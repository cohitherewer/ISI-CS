 Keppel in Bangalore

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 15: Singapore-based Keppel Land is one of the first foreign institutions to pick up a stake in an Indian housing project. 

 The company has teamed up with HDFC and Puravankara Projects, a Bangalore-based real estate developer, to launch its first housing project next week in Bangalore.

 HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said this would be among the first projects to kick off after the government relaxed norms for foreign entities planning to invest in real estate development. 

 The first project is a 1,524-unit condominium spread over 9.68-hectares in JP Nagar. The project was secured through Keppel-Puravankara Development Pte last year. 

 JP Nagar is an established residential estate valued for its proximity to Bangalores city centre; the Electronic City, a 130-hectare industrial park; and the Outer Ring Road where most of the IT campuses like Infosys, Wipro, Intel and IBM are located.

 Keppel Land will later develop its second condominium in Bangalore after securing 6.88 hectares for $10.5 million. 

 The project will be undertaken by a 51:49 joint venture between Keppel Investment (Mauritius) and Puravankara.

 Calcutta, Dec. 21: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has endorsed Bangladeshi industrys demand for more market access in India.

 I have taken it up with the Prime Minister and the finance minister. Bangladesh has valid points, he said at the 19th Industrial India Trade Fair here today.

 The bilateral trade of India and Bangladesh is heavily skewed in favour of the former. Of the $2.1-billion official trade, Bangladeshs share is only $144 million. It has, therefore, been asking for a greater market access for Bangladeshi products.

 The size of the informal trade between the two countries is pegged at $4 billion.

 Bhattacharjee said a growth in the two-way trade would be beneficial for both countries. We can ward off all problems of fundamentalism if trade and commerce thrives, he added.

 He said the Centre has allocated Rs 82 crore to boost infrastructure on the land ports connecting Bengal with Bangladesh.

 Plastic ban

 The Bengal government is contemplating a ban on the use of plastic bags in the state soon, Bhattacharjee said.

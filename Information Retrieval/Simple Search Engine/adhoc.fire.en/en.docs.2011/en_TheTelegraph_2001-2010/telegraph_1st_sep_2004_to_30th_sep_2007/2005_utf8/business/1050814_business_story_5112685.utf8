 HPCL picks Vizag for 15-mt refinery

 New Delhi, Aug. 13 (PTI): State-run Hindustan Petroleum Corporation plans to set up a new 15-million tonne export-oriented refinery at Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh at an investment of Rs 16,000 crore by 2011-12.

 Our existing 7.5-mt per annum Vizag refinery has space constraints and we cannot expand it beyond a certain capacity. We have plans to create an export-oriented refinery some 30-35 kilometres away from the existing refinery, HPCL chairman and managing director M.B. Lall said.

 The company has approached the Andhra Pradesh government to allot 2,500 acres of land in the proposed Special Economic Zone for the new refinery.

 Lall said HPCL would implement the project through a subsidiary and would seek foreign partners for building the refinery. The equity structure in the new refinery will, however, be similar to the one proposed for the 9-mt Bhatinda refinery.

 HPCL and the foreign partner will have 26 per cent stake each in the subsidiary while the rest 48 per cent would be offered to the public through an initial public offering.

 Lall said four global oil giants ? British Petroleum, Totalfina Elf of France, Malaysias Petronas and Saudi Aramco ? have evinced interest in partnering with HPCL for building the Rs 12,000-crore Bhatinda refinery project. We are in advanced stages of talks with the four firms and we expect to take a decision within two months, Lall added.

 Hindustan Petroleum, which owns a 6-mt5 refinery in Mumbai and some 6,800 petrol stations across the country, also plans to set up a refinery in Barmer district of Rajasthan where Cairn Energy of UK has found over 1 billion barrels of oil reserves. 

 The countrys second largest oil refining and marketing company has also drawn up plans to augment refining capacities at its existing Mumbai and Vizag refineries for higher volumes and better quality petrol and diesel.

 In Mumbai, the company is investing Rs 1,152 crore to upgrade the refining capacity from 5.5 mt at present to 7.9 mt per annum. The expansion would be completed by the third quarter of 2006, Lall said.

 The capacity of the existing refinery in Vizag is also being increased from 7.5 mt to 8.3 mt per annum with an investment of Rs 1,635 crore by the end of 2006, he aded. The refinery would be further expanded to 12 mt by 2007-08.

 HPCL is mulling to set up a petrochemical hub in Bhatinda at an investment of about Rs 5,000 crore to make the refinery viable. 

 The Punjab refinery would get crude oil from the Mundra-Bhatinda oil pipeline and the company has proposed to use this pipeline for the Rajashthan refinery as well.

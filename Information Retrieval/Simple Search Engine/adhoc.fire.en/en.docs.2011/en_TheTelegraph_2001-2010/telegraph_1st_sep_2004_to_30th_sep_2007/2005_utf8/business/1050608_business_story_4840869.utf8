 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 7: AirTel has introduced an advance version of the BlackBerry business phone in India ? BlackBerry 7100g. 

 The new handset has a ?SureType? keyboard technology, with wireless phone and e-mail capabilities. 

 The BlackBerry 7100g will be available in India at an introductory price of Rs 19,000, with the offer being valid for a limited period. The handset has been designed to offer high-speed data experience for users who prefer a traditional ?candy bar? handset design.

 The new phone packs all the benefits of a BlackBerry into a traditional phone design. The latest gadget provides benefits of a full-featured quad-band handset that includes Bluetooth support and speakerphone with push-based wireless email, short message service (SMS), web browser and personal organiser applications ? all on a large and bright, high-resolution colour screen. 

 The gadget has been developed for active mobile professionals who want to manage their work wherever they are and also keep in touch with family, friends and the latest news using an all-in-one handset.

 The BlackBerry 7100g innovative business phone is developed by Research In Motion, a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of innovative wireless solutions for the worldwide mobile communications market. 

 Announcing the launch of the BlackBerry 7100g in India, Atul Bindal, director and chief marketing officer, Bharti Cellular, said, ?BlackBerry has been well received by both AirTel?s prosumer and corporate customers. The launch of the BlackBerry 7100g will catalyse further its growth in India as it gives customers more choice and meets their mobile lifestyle needs and preferences.?

 Don Morrison, chief operating officer at Research In Motion, said: ?The BlackBerry 7100g and its innovative SureType keyboard technology delivers a compelling phone and messaging experience in a sleek and stylish design. AirTels strong technical and service capabilities add significant value and we think the combined offering will be very appealing to customers looking to upgrade from their existing mobile phone.?

 The BlackBerry 7100g allows four hours of talk time and eight days stand-by time and features quad band support (850/900/1800/1900 megahertz). 

 For individuals and smaller businesses, BlackBerry internet service allows users to access up to 10 corporate and/or personal e-mail accounts (including Microsoft Exchange, IBM Lotus, Domino, and many popular internet service providers (ISP) e-mail accounts) from a single device. 

 For corporate customers, BlackBerry Enterprise Server software tightly integrates with Microsoft Exchange, IBM Lotus Domino and Novell GroupWise and works with existing enterprise systems to enable push-based, wireless access to e-mail and other corporate data with industry-leading security features. 

 AirTel launched BlackBerry in October 2004 with three models in India ? the BlackBerry 7730, the BlackBerry 7230 and the BlackBerry 6230.

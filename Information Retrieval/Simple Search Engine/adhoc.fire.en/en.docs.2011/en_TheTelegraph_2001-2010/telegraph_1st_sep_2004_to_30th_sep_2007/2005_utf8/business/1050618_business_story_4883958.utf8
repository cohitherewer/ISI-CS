 Jharkhand CM stirs Tata land dispute

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Ranchi, June 17: The bitter-sweet relations between the Tatas and the Jharkhand government today once again spilled out in the open.

 Disregarding an appeal by Tata Steel pending before the high court, chief minister Arjun Munda declared in the Assembly that the Tatas were free to wait for the high court verdict or reach an out-of-court settlement on the renewal of Tata lease. 

 In any case the government is determined to take back the land under Schedule V (which is lying vacant), originally leased to Tata Steel under the Zamindari Act.

 Renewal of Tata lease has been a contentious issue pending since 1995 when the 10-year extension finally lapsed. The creation of Jharkhand, it was believed, would expedite a resolution and both Babulal Marandi, the first chief minister, and Arjun Munda had indicated their willingness to resolve the issue at the earliest. The dispute related to the higher rent demanded by the government and to land sub-leased by the company (Schedule IV) or the plots left unused.

 The sub-leased land under Schedule IV, the chief minister told the House, could be renewed only if the Tatas paid up Rs 136 crore demanded by the government as arrears and interest.

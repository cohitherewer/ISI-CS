 Overseas roaming on CDMA phones

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, May 31: CDMA subscribers will now be able to avail of international roaming facilities in countries offering services on the same platform.

 Reliance Infocomm has already started providing international roaming in China and the US last week. It plans to extend the facility to Australia, Korea, Japan, Israel and Brazil in the next two to three months.

 We plan to offer international roaming in all the countries that offer mobile services on the CDMA platform, said a Reliance Infocomm spokesperson. In Europe, which is predominantly a GSM market, we will integrate the CDMA network with that of GSM of Reliance Telecom to provide the roaming facility.

 Tata Teleservices, the second private CDMA operator in the country, has also entered into a tie-up with US-based Syniverse to offer international roaming for voice services and SMS to its subscribers.

 Till now, Reliance India Mobile (RIM) subscribers had to avail of roaming through a GSM tri-band handset and a Removable User Identification Module (RUIM) card, which could be used on the CDMA network as well.

 The telecom major also plans to roll out its network in Jammu and Kashmir by the year-end and is in the process of laying its fibre optic network in the state.

 Another major step towards providing 3G services on the CDMA network is upgrading to EV-DO (Evolution Data Optimised) that will allow data communication at a speed of 2.5 mbps on mobile handsets, said the spokesperson. This network will be ready by December. Currently, the speed is around 144 kbps. The rollout will, however, depend on spectrum allocation.

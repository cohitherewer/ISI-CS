 Calcutta, July 6: McLeod Russel India Limited aims to become a 100-million-kg tea company through overseas acquisitions by 2008.

 McLeod Russel, after acquiring Williamson Tea Assam, has a total production capacity of 62 million kg.

 The company is looking at acquisitions in Vietnam and Kenya, McLeod Russel vice-chairman Deepak Khaitan said on the sidelines of the companys extraordinary general meeting. 

 But nothing has been finalised as yet, he added.

 McLeod Russel today sought shareholders approval for increasing the borrowing limit to Rs 600 crore.

 Asked whether McLeod Russel was in talks with Philip Magor to buy out his Kenyan tea operations, Khaitan said he had not discussed anything with him.

 The financial closure of the Williamson Tea buyout deal will be achieved by the month-end and a roadmap for McLeod Russels growth will be ready by October.

 ICICI Bank has sanctioned a loan of Rs 155 crore to fund the acquisition of Williamson Tea by McLeod Russel from the UK-based Magors. The total cost of buyout is Rs 169 crore.

 ICICI Bank has sanctioned a loan of Rs 155 crore convertible into foreign exchange based on our requirement. The loan carried a two-year moratorium and an eight-year repayment period, McLeod Russel director K.K. Baheti said.

 The cost of the loan will be between 8 per cent and 8.5 per cent. The rest of the funds would be arranged internally, he said.

 The company was expecting to get Rs 169 crore from ICICI Bank.

 The total cost to McLeod Russel for acquiring Williamson Tea will be about Rs 210 crore, taking into consideration the pending open offer for an additional 20 per cent stake, according to the Securities and Exchange Board of Indias (Sebi) takeover guidelines.

 McLeod Russel has sold two of its properties at a consideration of Rs 26 crore. 

 The company expects to utilise this amount for participating in the open offer.

 The company had got 70 per cent control of the total capital after buying out the Magors. Mcleod had bought over 100 per cent of Borelli Tea Holdings, which holds 70 per cent in Williamson Tea.

 The Williamson Tea buyout was like homecoming for the Khaitans. 

 Williamson Tea was part of McLeod Russel before the split, which took place after the relationship between the Magors and Khaitans reportedly soured over some issues few years back.

 But, now the differences between the two families have been ironed out.

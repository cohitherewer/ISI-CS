 Textile firms weave hopes of duty cut

 Mumbai, Feb. 27: Excise and customs duties on man-made textiles are likely to be brought down in the Union Budget for 2005-06, narrowing the gap with the cotton segment, which was a major beneficiary last year.

 Excise duties on polyester staple fibre (PSF) are likely to come down to 8 per cent from 16 per cent, while it could stand reduced at 16 per cent on polyester filament yarn (PFY) from the existing 24 per cent. Duties on viscose filament yarn (NFY) and nylon filament yarn (NFY) could also come down to 8 per cent.

 Customs duties on intermediates such as purified terephthalic acid (PTA), mono ethylene glycol (MEG) and other petrochemicals may also come down to 10 per cent from 20 per cent.

 The difference between the man-made and cotton segments became pronounced after the last budget when Chidambaram announced major rationalisation in excise duties for cotton textiles. He then gave them two options ? one was the exemption route and the other, the Cenvat route. 

 Under the exemption route, it was stipulated that no excise duty will be payable at any stage (except on man-made fibre and filament yarn). On the other hand, under the Cenvat route, credit was allowed for all excise duties paid at earlier stages.

 This rationalisation, though welcome, gave cotton textiles an edge over its counterpart in the man-made space. Industry circles said the duty difference between cotton and man-made textiles are in the range of 8-24 per cent. 

 According to the Federation of All India Textile Manufacturers? Association (FAITMA), the disturbed parity led to rise in unsold stocks of man-made textiles and reduction in manufacturing activity.

 While the finance minister is likely to correct the disparity, the cuts in excise duties on PSF and PFY will be beneficial to majors like Reliance Industries Ltd and Indo-Rama Synthetics. The Delhi-based company will also benefit from a reduction in customs duties on PTA and MEG.

 With the quota regime abolished, Chidambaram may also announce few more measures to assist the domestic industry. These include reduction of excise and import duties on textile machinery. The Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme may also find a mention.

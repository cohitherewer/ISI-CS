 New mutual schemes to protect capital

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Damodaran: Focused

 Calcutta, Sept. 11: Retail investors would not get capital-guaranteed mutual fund products, because both the Association of Mutual Funds of India (Amfi) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) turned down endorsing the concept of a third-party guarantee on such products.

 Instead, the two are finalising the structure for protected capital products in which investment pattern and strategy should be such that it protects the capital of the investors.

 It can not be a guaranteed product, since then comes the question of a third-party guarantee and a mandatory credit rating, explained Sebi chairman M. Damodaran. 

 Globally, capital-guaranteed mutual fund products are quite popular among retail investors, particularly at a time when the capital markets are extremely volatile. However, such products are guaranteed by third parties and also rated by credit rating agencies.

 Therefore, the product should be structured in such a manner that the proposed investment pattern preserves the capital, Damodaran said.

 In a protected-capital product, capital will not be guaranteed, but there will be back-to-back investments such that the investors capital is protected, elaborated A.P. Kurien, chairman, Association of Mutual Funds of India. There will be a set of basic guidelines, while the individual structures of such funds can be dynamic, he added. 

 However, Kurien mentioned that such funds would ideally have a lock-in period of 3 to 5 years. Also, based on the investment strategy and patterns of the fund houses these could be close-ended, open-ended or even interval schemes, he said.

 We are working with Sebi to give clearance on the basic principles and architecture to launch such funds, Kurien informed. On how to keep a track on such funds, Kurien said, We might also introduce credit rating system for investment portfolios of these schemes, which will also help attracting investors.

 Welcoming Sebis move to reserve 5 per cent of qualified institutional bidders allocation in an IPO for mutual funds, Kurien said, This would further augment the mutual fund schemes portfolios and performances as it assures them with share allocation.

 It will also encourage retail investors to invest in mutual funds, since it gives them a sure shot way to invest in an IPO. Also, it saves them from the pitfalls of investing in dubious offers, Kurien added.

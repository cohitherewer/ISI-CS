 Refining to help IOC ease petro-sale pangs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Behuria: Smooth sailing

 New Delhi, April 13: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has notched up its highest-ever refinery margin of $6.25 per barrel this year, which will help the oil major rake in a decent profit during the financial year ended March 31.

 The spike in refinery margin will offset the Rs 8,400-crore loss in earnings the behemoth suffered after the government ? swayed by political compulsions ? forced it to sell LPG, kerosene, petrol and diesel below international market prices.

 IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria said the company had lost Rs 7,332 crore by selling kerosene and LPG at subsidised prices. However, part of this was reimbursed by ONGC and Gail to reduce the net loss on LPG and kerosene sales to Rs 6,565 crore for the year. Under-recoveries on petrol and diesel, which represent a notional loss, added up to Rs 1,100 crore. He did not divulge the expected net profit for the year ?as the figure is still being worked out?. 

 During 2003-04, the company had made a Rs 7,005-crore net profit. It had lost Rs 2,350 crore on kerosene and LPG sales. However, the refinery margins were lower at $5.3 per barrel. 

 IOC?s refineries processed 36.62 million tonnes of crude during 2004-05, which is a little lower than the 37.66 million tonnes processed during the preceding year as the Gujarat refinery had to be shut down for a while due to a technical snag.

 IOC has set a target of processing 39 million tonnes of crude for the current financial year as the expansion of the Panipat refinery from 6 to 12 million tonnes will be completed in October.

 Behuria said, ?I am very worried about this year as there has been a Rs 650-crore erosion in the earnings of the company on the sale of kerosene, LPG, diesel and petrol in the first fortnight.?

 While IOC has lost Rs 350 crore by selling LPG and kerosene at subsidised prices which will not be reimbursed by the government, it could have made another Rs 300 crore on petrol an diesel sales if the government had allowed the oil companies to raise the prices of these vehicular fuels to international levels.?

 IOC has drawn up an investment plan of Rs 4,745 crore for the current fiscal which forms part of companys 10th five-year plan (2002-07).

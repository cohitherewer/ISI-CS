 Patents act changes not to hit drug exports

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nath: Upbeat

 New Delhi, Jan. 28: Commerce minister Kamal Nath today asserted that the export of drugs from India will not in any way be affected by the amendments to the Indian Patents Act.

 Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, he said, ?The patent law in India, complying as it does with international norms for intellectual property, establishes India?s credibility and enormous strength in basic research and drug discovery.?

 He was speaking at a session on ?India meets Doha?, which discussed the WTO agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) in the context of the healthcare industry.

 According to a commerce ministry statement, Nath underlined the possibility of India taking centre stage in drug development in the near future. He said the country had a $10 billion pharmaceutical industry which was the fourth largest in terms of volume and 13th in terms of value.

 India is emerging as a low-cost centre for medical research, he said, adding that with higher patent protection, more research would take place here given the cost advantage and large pool of technical and scientific talent in the country.

 The minister said, ?Outsourcing in India has become an option. While it provides cost-benefit to giant pharmaceutical companies, it is also a huge opportunity for small international firms, which do not have well-developed drug discovery programmes.?

 The global market for generic drugs is currently estimated at $40 billion and the impending expiry of patents on drugs worth $60 billion during the next five years offered a huge opportunity to India, he said. He reiterated that the new patents regime would not affect domestic prices as 97 per cent of drugs were already off-patent.

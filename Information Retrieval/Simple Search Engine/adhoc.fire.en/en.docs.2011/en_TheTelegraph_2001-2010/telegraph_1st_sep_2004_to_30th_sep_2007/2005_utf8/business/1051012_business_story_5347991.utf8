 Trade offer under scanner

 Geneva, Oct. 11 (Reuters): Leading developing countries on Tuesday weighed a response to offers by the United States and the European Union of freer farm markets as pressure mounted for a breakthrough in troubled world trade talks.

 Members of the Brazil- and India-led G-20 alliance were poring over the details of the US and EU plans as World Trade Organisation (WTO) states struggle to make progress ahead of an end-year deadline for a deal.

 The meeting will be followed by a session of trade ministers from the United States, the EU, Brazil, India and Australia, a group which embraces a wide range of trade interests and which has been instrumental in breaking deadlocks in the past.

 The 148-state WTO needs to agree a blueprint for the final stage of its Doha Round at a ministerial conference in Hong Kong in December but negotiations are snagged on a host of issues, of which agriculture is the most pressing.

 Hong Kong provides what is widely seen as the last chance for agreement on the basic lines of a pact to lower barriers to trade and pump billions of dollars into the global economy and lift millions out of poverty.

 Initial reactions to the separate EU and US plans ? for subsidy cuts between 60 and 80 percent and lower tariffs ? were downbeat. Brazil said they were not enough while Japan, a major food importer, rejected the US blueprint out of hand as too ambitious.

 It is not what we want but ... it can get things moving, Brazils foreign minister Celso Amorim told journalists in Zurich, where the US hosted a meeting of ministers on Monday, before flying to Geneva for two more days of talks.

 Onus on EU

 The minister, who said he was speaking only for Brazil and not the G-20, argued the onus was on the EU to improve on its proposal to cut food import tariffs by up to 50 per cent.

 That would not open the blocs markets significantly to third world goods, Amorim declared.

 Aid agency Oxfam, often close to poor country thinking, dismissed ideas for cutting subsidies and tariffs presented by US trade representative Robert Portman as smoke and mirrors aimed at getting painful concessions from developing nations.

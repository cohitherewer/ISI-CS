 Govt goes full throttle on cess

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

New Delhi, Feb 28: Petrol and diesel prices are expected to go up by at least 50 paise per litre from April 1 due to the additional road cess introduced in the budget.

 The 50 paise per litre road cess could actually translate into a higher increase as excise duty and sales tax levies would be added to it. The only way the consumers could escape the price hike is if international oil prices crash which at the moment seems unlikely. 

 But the budget has given a respite to the downstream oil companies ? Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum ?which were losing money on the sales of LPG and kerosene. Their profits had plummeted during 2003-04.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram admitted today that the countrys corporate tax collections had come down because of the decline in the profits of the public sector oil companies. 

 The reduction of excise duty on LPG and kerosene to nil will ease the burden on the oil companies as apart from losing Rs 110 per cylinder on cooking gas and Rs 7 per litre on the sale of kerosene they were being forced to shell out a 12 per cent and 8 per cent excise duty on kerosene and domestic LPG respectively. 

 Since LPG and kerosene were also being imported the fact that customs duty on these products has been reduced to nil will also help the oil companies. 

 Oil on the boil 

The reduction of customs duty on crude oil from 10 

per cent to 5 per cent has also come as a welcome relief as crude oil accounts 

for as much as 90 per cent of the cost of production of the petrol, diesel and 

LPG.

 The fact that the budget has fixed excise duties on petrol and diesel as a combination of ad valorem and specific duty will help to shield the oil companies to some extent. Under the current practice based entirely on the ad valorem system, the excise duties shoot up in the same proportion when the prices of these fuels go up.

 The new duty structure has been devised in such a manner that it would yield the same amount of revenue. The reduction in customs duty will be offset by an increase in the excise duty on some petroleum products. 

 According to the new duty structure petrol will attract 8 per cent excise duty plus Rs 5 per litre instead of present 23 per cent duty. On top of it would be the road cess and Rs 6 per litre special additional excise duty. On diesel, excise duty would be 8 per cent plus Rs 1.25 per litre as against present 8 per cent duty. A 50 paise road cess will be added. 

 Excise duty on light diesel oil used in industry has been increased to 16 per cent plus Rs 2.50 per litre which is up from 16 per cent plus Rs 1.50 per litre.

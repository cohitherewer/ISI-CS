 Calcutta, Oct. 31: Simplex Concrete Piles (India) Ltd is betting big on international projects as it aims to garner 50 per cent of its turnover from overseas markets.

 At present, about one third of its business comes from international projects. Of its Rs 3,500-crore order book, the company is executing business worth Rs 1,000 crore overseas.

 We are hoping to secure 50 per cent of our business from overseas markets in three years from now, Simplex director Rajiv Mundhra said.

 The company will focus on infrastructure, power, urban utilities and construction while doing business abroad.

 It is a member of a consortium that has been shortlisted for the multi-crore Dubai Metro project. 

 Simplex sees opportunities in West Asia, CIS countries, especially Russia, and Africa.

 Even as 50 per cent of its business comes from the power sector alone, the company is now spreading its arm to other infrastructure areas.

 The company will change its name to Simplex Infrastructure to reflect its nature of business. It has applied to the registrar of companies (RoC) for the same.

 Simplex has recorded a whopping 526.57 per cent growth in net profit for the quarter ended September 30.

 Chairman B.D. Mundhra said the good time was yet to come. The boom time in infrastructure is yet to come, but it would stay for quite some time. We are confident of maintaining the growth going forward, he said.

 In the second quarter, net profit jumped from Rs 1.43 crore in the same period last fiscal to Rs 8.96 crore this year. Sales, however, rose to Rs 274.5 crore from Rs 215.6 crore last year. Earnings per share jumped to Rs 12.29 from Rs 1.95.

 Calcutta, March 11: Beeyu Overseas Limited will form a joint venture with Tata Coffee soon to set up a fridge-dried coffee plant in the country.

 Beeyu chairman B. P. Singh said the total investment in the project will be around Rs 80 crore.

 The south Indian tea producer and Tata Coffee will chip in Rs 10 crore each in the joint venture, while the balance will be raised as bank finance.

 He said the 50:50 joint venture will take the form of a new company, which is likely to be floated in April. The senior officials from both the companies are currently visiting various European countries to identify machinery and equipment needed for the plant. 

 Singh said the joint venture will be the first of its kind to manufacture fridge-dried coffee in India, adding that the entire produce will be exported to countries, including Russia. 

 The plant will be located in Madurai, Singh said. At present, Beeyu, which is headquartered in Calcutta, produces 3,000 tonnes of tea. 

 The company has drawn up expansion plans. To part finance the expansion, the company will raise capital from the market. It has filed a draft prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for the purpose. The issue is expected to hit the market in April.

 The company will raise Rs 10 crore from the public. The issue with a face value of Rs 10 each will be sold with a premium of Rs 4 per share. After the issue, the promoter?s holding in the company will be 30 per cent and the remaining 70 per cent will be with the public.

 Canara Bank has been appointed as lead manager to the issue. The company has appointed Crisil to do a credit rating.

 Beeyu plans to raise the annual production to 9000 tonnes for which it will adopt a village in Ooty for buying tea leaves. The company?s factory is in Ooty and it owns a garden in the Nilgiris.

 Nearly 40 per cent of the total production will be exported and the remaining 60 per cent will be used domestically.

 The company has no plans to buy out gardens in the south as it puts pressure on the margins. ?The cost of production is high,? Singh added.

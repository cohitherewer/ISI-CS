 Moodys seeks details

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 22: Moodys Investor Service today said a possible upgrade of Reliance Industries (RIL) will have to wait till details of the recent sibling settlement are out.

 In a statement issued from London today, the rating agency said it would continue to review the ba2 rating on RIL for a boost that hinges on the corporate restructuring and a financial settlement within the group.

 The agency said it was waiting for details of the resolution of the ownership issue, which was a key development. RILs fundamental operational and financial profile is strong for its current rating and the review for upgrade will require further details on the potential restructuring before conclusion, it added.

 Moodys assessment comes days after Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P) warned that RILs credit quality could weaken if significant cash outflows were part of the settlement.

 Pointing to the fact that the financial aspects of the settlement are still unclear, Anshukant Taneja, an analyst with the rating agency, had said: Specifically, significant cash outflows, possibly resulting from share repurchases, division and distribution of liabilities and/or the contingent obligations of RIL, could affect the companys financial profile. This might weaken its credit quality.

 S amp;P said the full impact of the re-organisation of group businesses on the rating of RIL (BB+/Stable) will be known when details are released by the company. Referring to the companys announcement, S amp;P said the board of RIL is working on a re-organisation of businesses. As part of this, Mukesh Ambani will take unalloyed control of RIL and IPCL, the groups oil, gas and petrochemicals businesses. Anil will call the shots at Reliance Infocomm, Reliance Energy, and Reliance Capital. 

 The de-merger and eventual exit of RIL from capital-intensive telecom and power businesses should not have a negative impact on its business risk profile, the agency said.

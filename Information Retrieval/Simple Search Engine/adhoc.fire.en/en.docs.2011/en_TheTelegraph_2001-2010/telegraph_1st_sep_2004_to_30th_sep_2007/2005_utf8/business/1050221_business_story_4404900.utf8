 Alert on high home loans

 New Delhi, Feb. 20 (PTI): The domestic banking industry?s increased exposure to the housing sector could trigger a asset-liability mismatch, warned B. D. Narang, chairman of Oriental Bank of Commerce. ?Some banks have exposure as high as 20 per cent in the housing sector and if unchecked it has the potential to disrupt the banking sector,? he said.

 Narang said one of the reasons for the East Asian currency meltdown in the late 1990s was high exposure to the property sector. Banks were borrowing short term but lending for long-term periods. 

 This should be an eye-opener for the Indian banks, which has huge exposure in the housing sector. But, at the moment the overall position of Indian banks was comfortable, he added.

 Mix and fix a matchbox room

 The essential thing to keep in mind for efficient space utilisation is planning. Proper planning is the key to make the bedroom look and feel different. Ensure that space management is apt and also that it does not dig a huge hole in your pocket. 

 The idea is to first make an overall list of what you want in the bedroom and then gradually do the detailing.

 Obviously, you need a bed ? but whether it should be a double bed, two single beds, box beds, futons or simply a mattress on the floor is a decision that comes a little later. 

 Typically, the bedroom should be self-contained. Other than wardrobes and the bed, some sitting area, study area, dressing area or space for a TV/hi-fi system could also be looked into.

 Nowadays, the actual carpet area available in a bedroom (typically 10 ft by 12 ft) makes the room look cramped with just the wardrobes and the bed. So putting in additional furniture and yet having some ?breathing? space is the challenge. This simple first step is the key because it makes life a lot easier to get what you want once you know for sure what you want.

 The wardrobe consumes a lot of space so it would be a good idea to design it properly ensuring that everything fits. The top portion could be covered to contain the bulkier items and the central portion could be made to accommodate the dressing table and the TV/hi-fi unit. Its foldable shutter can double as a study table top, too.

 ?Box beds? are also popular for the bulkier and less frequently used items, and these days, drawers are used to enable easier utilisation of this. It should be noted that once the bed is ?boxed?, movement around the bedroom is restricted.

 The simplest way to ensure that this does not happen is to use the ?futon? concept or have a foldable bed with attached side units for additional storage. Additional seating can be provided with foldable chairs, bean bags (space consuming but trendy) or any other sort of seating to suit one?s taste.

 The cost of customising furniture would vary between Rs 400 per sq ft and upwards till Rs 900 per sq ft, making the room cost around Rs 60,000 to Rs 80,000. 

 However, one could mix and match from a lot of knockdown furniture options which would halve the cost but involve a lot more running around and, of course, some sacrifice with the overall design and layout. A mixture of both options is also worth experimenting with.

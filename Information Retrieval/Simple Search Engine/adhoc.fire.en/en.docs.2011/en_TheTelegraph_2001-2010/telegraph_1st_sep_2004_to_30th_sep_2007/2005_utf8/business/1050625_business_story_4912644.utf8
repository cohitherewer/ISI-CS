 Calcutta, June 24: Standard Chartered Mutual Fund has unveiled its first equity fund ? Standard Chartered Classic Equity Fund.

 It is also the first equity fund to be launched globally by the bank-sponsored asset management company, managing director Naval Bir Kumar said.

 India was the first asset management venture of Standard Chartered Bank, which it acquired from ANZ Grindlays along with the bank. Riding on the success of the venture, the bank now has similar operations in London, said Kumar.

 However, we decided to launch our first equity fund here, based on our view of the strong Indian story, he added.

 Standard Chartered Classic Equity will be an unrestricted fund, in lines of Fidelity Equity Fund, Franklin Flexicap and HDFC Multicap, said Kumar.

 Prior to these funds, most of the diversified funds were basically restrictive in their investment objective, be it across market capitalisation or sectors, explained Kumar.

 Vice-president (equity) Bobby Surendranath said the fund house has devised the equity circle process, which will continuously track various factors spread across three broad areas of business, valuation and market interest.

 The process checks will deliver consistent annual upper quartile result among its peers and control overall business, liquidity and market risk. This will follow companies profit over two to three years and identify consistent track record, he said.

 We plan to launch a series of equity funds over the next couple of years, which will cater to varied investor requirements. Our second offer will be a niche product, though not restricted, Kumar added.

 The Classic Equity Fund offer will open on June 27 and continue till July 14, the minimum investment amount being Rs 5,000.

 The fund will be benchmarked against BSE 200 and will open for continuous sale and purchase not later than August 13.

 For investment amount less than Rs 5 crore, the entry load will be 2.25 per cent, while it is nil for purchases equal to or more than Rs 5 crore. There will be no exit load.

 However, for systematic investment and transfer plan, where no entry load is being charged, there shall be an exit load of 2 per cent, if the amount is redeemed within two years of allotment.

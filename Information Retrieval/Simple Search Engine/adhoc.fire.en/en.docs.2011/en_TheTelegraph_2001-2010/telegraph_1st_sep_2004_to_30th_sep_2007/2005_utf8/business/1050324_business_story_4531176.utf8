 Tata Steel sharpens price edge

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 23: Tata Steel will raise long-term contract prices of its products up to 20 per cent from April.

 Long-term contract contributes 75-80 per cent of Tata Steel?s volume. The company did not raise product prices for long-term contracts since July last year despite sharp hikes in the raw material cost.

 Tata Steel?s annual long-term contracts are coming to an end this month and new rates are being thrashed out with customers.

 ?The company is in the final stages of negotiations. New rates will come into effect next month,? sources said.

 While Tata Steel has held on to the same rates till July, other players have raised prices in between.

 Along with Tata Steel, all other steel majors are looking at a 10-15 per cent rise in prices from next month.

 The cold-rolled prices are now around Rs 33,000 a tonne, while hot-rolled coil rates are Rs 29,000 a tonne. Prices of galvanised products are Rs 39,000 a tonne, while those of long products are around Rs 27,000 a tonne.

 However, it is yet to be seen whether the market is ready to bear the extra cost. ?The demand-supply situation will have to be considered. The price differential with imports will have to be borne in mind,? a Steel Authority of India (SAIL) official said.

 SAIL, for instance, will take a final call at the end of the month. ?We will review the market situation and rates of our competitors and take a call,? he added.

 In the past one year, long product prices have gone up by 40 per cent, while cold-rolled prices increased by 30 per cent. The rates of hot-rolled coils have also appreciated by 36 per cent in the same period.

 In contrast, hot-rolled prices have gone up by 110 per cent, cold-rolled by 83 per cent, plates by 144 per cent and rod/bars by 103 per cent in the US.

 The price differential between landed cost at the port and domestic prices for hot-rolled coil is Rs 3,000 a tonne while it is Rs 1,500-2,000 a tonne for long products.

 It can be recalled that the costs of key raw materials (iron ore and coking coal) have gone up substantially. Companies, which have raw material linkages, are better off.

 According to market sources, input cost pressure on Tata Steel is far less than its competitor like SAIL, Ispat, Essar and Jindals.

 Leading iron ore manufacturers across the globe have decided on an over 70 per cent rise for the annual contract of 2005-06. Lump prices will go up from $42 per tonne (f..b) to about $71.2 a tonne. Coking coal prices will go up from $57 a tonne to $125-130 a tonne.

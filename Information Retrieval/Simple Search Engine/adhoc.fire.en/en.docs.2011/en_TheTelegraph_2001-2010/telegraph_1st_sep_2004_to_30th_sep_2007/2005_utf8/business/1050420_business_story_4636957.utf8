 KPMG puts banks on alert

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 19: A survey by accounting firm KPMG shows that the country?s anti-money laundering regulations are still in its infancy and banks need to put in place better systems.

 ?We are still in the first stage of implementation,? said H. N. Sinor, chief executive of the Indian Banks Association, at the function to unveil the KPMG report. 

 KPMG is the global network of professional services firms, which provide audit, tax and advisory services.

 According to industry sources, annually $590 billion-$1.5 trillion is laundered through the global economy, which equates to 2-5 per cent of global GDP. The KPMG report says, ?Banks are adopting a risk-based approach, but higher risk customers such as politically exposed persons need greater focus.? 

 The report recommends the banks to have an automated transaction monitoring system to combat the crime. 

 ?Increased regulation (internationally and locally) and recognition by financial institutions of the need to preserve their reputation makes investment in a robust anti-money laundering system vital,? KPMG associate director Colin Lobo said.

 The country has put in place an anti-money laundering law in 2002 and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) over the past two years has prodded commercial banks to put in place more rigorous know-your-customer (KYC) rules to curb money laundering. 

 ?Nearly 70 per cent of the respondents think anti-money laundering regulations are in (their) infancy in India and there was a need to improve technology to help track such activities,? Lobo said. 

 The survey included 100 banks, financial institutions and insurance companies in India and termed politicians as high-risk customers. 

 India is yet to join the Financial Action Task Force, an inter-governmental initiative to support reforms and check deficiencies in anti-money laundering regulations. This will add to the stature of domestic banks, said Sinor. 

 Another driver to incorporate tough norms by domestic banks is their ambition to do business abroad. This has prompted many of them to put in place measures to meet regulations aimed at curbing money laundering. 

 ?About 58 per cent of the respondents felt that the degree of supervision from overseas regulators was ever increasing,? the survey said. 

 In the budget, finance minister P. Chidambaram had proposed to impose a levy of 0.1 per cent on cash withdrawals of Rs 10,000 and above. It was argued that the new levy would establish an audit trail and help snare tax evaders. 

 But Sinor said banks feel that the proposal should be spiked and if the government insists, then the minimum limit should be raised to Rs 50,000.

 Blame call drops on clogged links

 New Delhi, Oct. 4: Irritated by call drops and poor quality of phone calls? Blame it on interconnection (or the lack of it) between state-owned BSNL and the private mobile operators. 

 Interconnection is a hotbutton issue in the world of warring telecom titans. The telecom regulator has come out with a quality of service (QoS) study that makes a damning comment on the games that telecom giants play. 

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) said: ?One of the major causes of concern is that the congestion is largely between the private operators and BSNL. In the last one year, Trai had discussed this issue with all cellular mobile service providers (CSMPs), including BSNL, but the situation has shown no perceptible improvement.?

 Trai has been monitoring this parameter over the past year. The results reveal that in a number of areas, the degree of congestion between the operators is alarming.

 In a multi-operator environment, a subscriber expects the same efficiency when making a call irrespective of the network from which the call originates or terminates. This requires an efficient interconnection system between operators. 

 The pre-requisite for that is availability of adequate number of junctions between firms. With the exponential increase in subscribers over the last two years and the large number of operators in each service area, the issue of efficient and adequate interconnection system has become very important.

 Trai has been monitoring the provision of interconnection between various operators. Considering its effect on quality of service, it specified a separate parameter ?congestion at point of interconnection? in a July order. 

 The operators are required to submit the data regarding this parameter on a monthly basis. 

 The benchmark for the inter-network congestion level for acceptable service quality is less than 0.5 per cent. 

 In a number of major and minor cities, the level of congestion between networks of private operators and those of BSNL is far more than this benchmark. The number of such places are increasing. 

 In the month of January 2005, there were about 24 places with congestion levels of more than 10 per cent. This is 20 times worse than the benchmark. 

 In July, the number of such places has increased to 86, the survey added.

 Industrial parks to save farm land

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 28: The sector-specific parks initiated by the Bengal government will help it minimise conversion of agricultural land for industry.

 Bengal commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen said the parks would consolidate operations of many units and thereby save land.

 There is a campaign against the government on the land issue, which is not right. We are only trying to build upon the success of agriculture to boost industry, Sen said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Indian Plastic Federation.

 Bengal is assisting in the development of various sector-specific parks for industries like foundry, plastic, rubber and food processing.

 Since all the units in a park will share a common facility, the requirement of land will be less.

 Defending his governments move to acquire land, Sen said: Industry has to be promoted. But there is not enough land in Bengal. So we have to take agricultural land at times.

 A poly park is being set up in Sankrail, Howrah by the Association of Plastic Manufacturers. West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) has got 50 acres, which will be handed over soon. The association has asked for more land there.

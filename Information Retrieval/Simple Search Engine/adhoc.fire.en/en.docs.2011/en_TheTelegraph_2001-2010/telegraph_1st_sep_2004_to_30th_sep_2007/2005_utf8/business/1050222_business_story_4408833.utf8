 Pepsi ties up with Lever for iced tea

 New Delhi, Feb. 21 (PTI): Pepsi today said that it would come out with Lipton iced tea, in partnership with Hindustan Lever Ltd (HLL), in the next few months, even as it eyes a 20 per cent revenue growth of its carbonated drinks this year.

 ?We will launch Lipton iced tea in three cities to begin with, from where we would gradually expand,? Pepsi India chief Rajiv Bakshi said.

 He said they would offer the drink in glass bottles, adding that ?plastic pet may or may not come soon.?

 In 2003, Pepsi and HLL had signed an agreement for selling hot beverages, including Lipton tea and other flavoured drinks. The plan to sell Lipton iced tea was part of an international agreement signed last year between Pepsi and HLL parent Unilever.

 Regarding the carbonated soft drink segment (CSD), Bakshi said the company had a 17-18 per cent growth last year. The company has recently gone in for a hike in prices of its various offerings and Bakshi expected a 20 per cent jump in terms of value this year.

 The company, which launched a new campaign for its 7up drink featuring model Yana Gupta as well as an Indianised version of its animated brand ambassador Fido, said its advertising and market budget will be up 15-20 per cent this year. Among other things, the company is the title sponsor for the one-day matches in the forthcoming India-Pakistan cricket series. The company is also planning major campaigns through ?Fido?, which includes promotions through bollywood movies.

 Asked if the company planned to raise soft drink prices further, Bakshi replied in the negative. ?Currently, we have no plans to either decrease or increase prices.?

 The company will increase focus on health products. The health portfolio, which includes juices, diet beverages, bulk water and low fat snacks, contributes 16 per cent to overall revenues.

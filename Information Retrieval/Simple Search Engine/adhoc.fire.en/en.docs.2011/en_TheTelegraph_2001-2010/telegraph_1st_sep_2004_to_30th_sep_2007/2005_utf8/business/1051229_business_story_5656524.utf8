 SAIL pitches for steel mergers

 Calcutta, Dec. 28: The Steel Authority of India (SAIL) is building up a case for merging public-sector steel companies, undaunted by the failure of a similar consolidation move in petroleum companies.

 The largest domestic steel producer feels state-owned steel firms must unite to ward off competition from global majors like Posco and Mittal Steel, which have planned massive units in the country.

 SAIL feels PSUs should consolidate instead of competing against each other, company chairman V.S. Jain said here today.

 The government has set up a committee to look into the possibilities of merging different state-owned entities under former secretary B.K. Das.

 SAIL will benefit largely from the entire move as the company intends to bring in Vizag Steel (Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd), Nilachal Ispat and Manganese Ore and Iron Ltd (MOIL).

 The company is negotiating hard with the Orissa government and MMTC, a ministry of commerce subsidiary, to take over Nilachal Ispat.

 The talks are on. I am hopeful of a positive outcome, Jain said regarding Nilachal Ispat.

 The management of Rashtriya Ispat, however, is unwilling to be merged with SAIL. The Andhra Pradesh government has also expressed reservation about the merger proposal.

 Since there are many views on this subject, the committee would ultimately decide on what is going to be good for the country. On a personal note and from SAIL, we believe that merger of all steel companies could be a good idea, Jain added.

 While the merger is needed to remain competitive, the company is leaving no stone unturned to cut down costs.

 The company has decided to trim workforce by another 25,000.

 It has already lowered its headcount by 50,000 to 1,25,000 through various separation schemes.

 We want the number to be down by another 25,000, Jain said.

 Around 2,000 people had opted for the last scheme. Jain said a new scheme could be launched in the next three years.

 However, manpower poaching by other steel firms remain a concern for the company.

 We have managed to keep our expenses in check so that we can handle the possible downturn, if that comes, the chairman said.

 CSE delisting

 SAIL today informed the stock exchanges that it had delisted its shares voluntarily from the Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE). Many bluechip companies are delisting shares from regional stock exchanges due to lack of trading volumes and presence of the National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange.

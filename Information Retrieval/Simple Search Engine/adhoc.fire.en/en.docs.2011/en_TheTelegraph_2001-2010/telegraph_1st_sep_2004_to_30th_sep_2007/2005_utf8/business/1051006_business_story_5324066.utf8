 Thapars taste for Nirulas 

 GAURAV CHOUDHURY

 New Delhi, Oct. 5: Gautam Thapar-controlled Global Green is emerging as the frontrunner in buying out Nirulas, the city-based fast-food retail chain.

 Nirulas, however, is also considering going in for a private equity placement to raise funds to stand up to competition from global majors.

 A Nirulas official refused to divulge details saying the company would prefer not to comment at this stage.

 Merchant banking sources said Global Green and Jollibee Foods of the Phillipines were major contenders if the fast-food chain decided to opt for an outright sale.

 Global Green produces and markets fresh fruits and vegetables at home and abroad. It also has a premium range of processed foods, marketed under the brand name Tify. At present, it is importing jams from England and marketing them in India. The products are targeted at the high-end premium market with the price significantly higher than those manufactured and marketed domestically.

 Sources said Nirulas has appointed a merchant banker to examine various options ranging from an outright sale to that of raising funds through instruments, including private placement of equity and an IPO.

 The funding options are being considered against a range of parameters as many believe even in the heat of stiff competition from MNCs like McDonalds, Nirulas has been able to hold its ground in the northern region of the country.

 It has more than 60 outlets. About 59 of them are in the National Capital Region, run primarily through franchisees. It was one of the first upmarket food chains in the country to offer typically American fast-food items. It has carved out a niche for itself in the ice-cream segment. The company also operates three hotels in the region.

 Sources, however, said the top management of the Rs 100-crore company, are yet to thrash out the final contours of the strategy and only informal discussions with prospective buyers have been held so far.

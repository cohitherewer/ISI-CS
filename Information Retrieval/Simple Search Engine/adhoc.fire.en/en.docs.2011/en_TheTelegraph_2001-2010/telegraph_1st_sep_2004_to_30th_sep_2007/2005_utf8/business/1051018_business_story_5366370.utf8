 Crisil lowers Essel outlook

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 17: Credit rating agency Crisil today downgraded its outlook on Essel Propack on concerns that the aggressive and substantially debt-funded expansion plans of the laminated tube manufacturer would increase its financial risk.

 Accordingly, the credit rating of Essel Propack has been revised from stable to negative. 

 Crisil noted that while the companys expansion plan was in line with its objective to attain 50 per cent share of the global laminated tubes industry, funding the same by sizeable debts could weaken its financial protection following a bunching of debt repayments over the medium term.

 On the other hand, the incremental cash accruals due to capacity additions will occur with a time lag as it will take time to stabilise operations in the new facilities. Further, Essel Propack faces risks from its large financial exposure to related parties in the form of inter-corporate deposits, the rating agency added.

 As a result, there is a strong likelihood of coverage indicators coming under pressure over the medium term, leading to deterioration in the financial risk profile of Essel Propack.

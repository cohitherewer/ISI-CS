 HSBC Global picks up 9.76% in Eveready

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 1: HSBC Global Investment Funds has acquired a 9.76 per cent stake in Eveready Industries India Limited, a BM Khaitan group company.

 The company has informed the National Stock Exchange that HSBC Global has acquired 70 lakh shares, aggregating 9.76 per cent of the total paid-up capital of Eveready, on November 29. The mode of acquisition is through international GDR offering.

 At present, the only FII investment in the company is by Merrill Lynch Investment Managers at 1.78 per cent. The promoters hold 53.75 per cent as on September 30, 2005.

 Eveready?s issue of global depository receipts (GDRs) opened on November 25 and closed on November 28. The company closed the issue for an aggregate sum of $33 million. The GDRs will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Each GDR was priced at $2.0666, equivalent to Rs 95 per share, converted on the basis of the closing spot rupee-dollar exchange rate as on November 28, 2005 of 45.96. 

 The company, which makes batteries, flashlights and packet tea, will use the proceeds of the GDR to retire high-cost debt of Rs 90 crore and pay for the acquisition of the battery business of BPL, which will cost it Rs 45 crore.

 The company has managed to pass on a 5-7 per cent rise in prices due to higher raw material rates to customers. 

 The group was also bullish on the long-term prospects in the top end of the quality tea business and would look at growth there too. The group could either build brands in-house of go in for buy-outs to grow its business. 

 The group has set up a small taskforce to maximise returns from its real estate assets in Chennai, Hyderabad, Lucknow and Noida. The task force would prepare a list of opportunities the group could exploit to maximise returns from its surplus assets.

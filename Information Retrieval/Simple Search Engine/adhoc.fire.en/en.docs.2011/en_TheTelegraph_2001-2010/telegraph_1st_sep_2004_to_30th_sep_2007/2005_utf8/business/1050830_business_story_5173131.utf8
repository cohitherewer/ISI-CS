 NPA silver lining

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 29: Commercial banks have scored good marks on bad assets. Both the gross and net non-performing assets (NPAs) came down in 2004-05, while the net NPA ratio slipped below 2 per cent for the first time. 

 The decline was due to increased recovery and overall reduction in asset slippage. Only four banks had net NPAs in excess of 10 per cent of their net advances.

 The capital adequacy ratio of commercial banks took a marginal hit in 2004-05 due to the increase in total risk weighted assets relative to capital.

 According to the annual report released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today, capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of banks came down to 12.8 per cent in 2004-05 from 12.9 per cent on March 31, 2004 . 

 CAR is the ratio of a banks capital to its risk-weighted credit exposure. According to RBI regulations, this should be at least 9 per cent.

 Higher growth in the advances portfolio of banks and higher risk weights made applicable for housing loans, which is the most rapidly increasing retail loans component, contributed to the increase in risk weighted assets. The RBI added the core capital ratio of banks (Tier I) rose to 8.5 per cent from 8.1 per cent.

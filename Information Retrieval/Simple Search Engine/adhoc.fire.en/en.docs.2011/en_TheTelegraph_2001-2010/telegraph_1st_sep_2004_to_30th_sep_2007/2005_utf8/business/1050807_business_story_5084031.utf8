 A word of caution for industry

 New Delhi, Aug. 6 (PTI): The Union government today said the new companies bill will be placed shortly before Parliament but cautioned the industry against blindly copying western corporate governance practices.

 The government is actively examining the report of the Irani Committee and would place the new companies bill before Parliament shortly, company affairs minister P.C. Gupta told an industry meet here.

 On the issue of independent directors, he said, What matters more than the number of independent directors is the quality of directors. In fact, we require independent directors on whom the stakeholders can depend. The showpiece may fulfil the requirement of law but not the spirit. 

 Gupta added that the industry should also come at a consensus on the number of independent directors on the board. He pointed out that the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) had earlier sought 33 per cent seats for independent directors but later raised it to 45 per cent while the Confederation of Indian Industry (Cii) originally asked for restricting the number to 35 per cent.

 Taking a dig, the minister said that some companies appointed celebrities on the board. What kind of performance would you expect from actresses and film stars? he queered.

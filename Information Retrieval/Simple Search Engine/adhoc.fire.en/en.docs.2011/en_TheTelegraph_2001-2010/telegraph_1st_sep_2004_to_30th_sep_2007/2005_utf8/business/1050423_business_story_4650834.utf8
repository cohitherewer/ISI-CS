The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Berger board meet to mull share buy 

 back

 Dhingra: Exit sops

 Calcutta, April 22: Berger Paints India Ltd plans to buy back its shares. In a notice to stock exchanges, the company said the buyback proposal would be considered when the Berger board meets on April 29.

 It will buy back around 2 per cent of the share capital. Berger chairman Kuldip Singh Dhingra told The Telegraph, ?The structure and modalities of the offer, including the price, will be decided at the board meeting.?

 The development has taken the market by surprise as the company had split its stock by reducing the face value from Rs 10 to Rs 2 and also issued bonus shares in the ratio of 1:2 to increase liquidity on the bourses in the last one year. Analysts feel the move may be a precursor to a possible delisting of shares from the bourses.

 On March 31, the promoters? stake in Berger was 73.53 per cent, up from 67.25 per cent at the end of the December quarter. The company re-classified the shareholding of individual promoters, which was earlier included under the Indian public category, and brought under the promoter category. 

 However, Dhingra said there was no plan to delist the company. 

 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) guidelines say that the non-promoter shareholding has to be at least 25 per cent of paid-up capital to keep it listed on the exchanges. Dhingra said the promoter?s stake would not cross 75 per cent even after the buyback. 

 According to Sebi guidelines, promoters, who hold more than 75 per cent of the share capital in a company, will have to either divest their shareholding to 75 per cent or below or make an open offer through a reverse book-building route to buy back and de-list its shares from the exchanges within a stipulated timeframe.

 Dhingra said the buyback was being considered to provide an exit opportunity to the existing shareholders and also to enhance the earnings per share of the company. 

 The company has substantial reserves deployed in various assets and would generate sufficient cash flow to meet the requirements of present business and assure adequate returns to its stakeholders.

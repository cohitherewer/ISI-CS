 DRL posts 72% rise in profit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 29: Bolstered by a strong business growth in Europe and CIS countries, Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy?s Laboratories Ltd (DRL) today reported a 72 per cent jump in its second-quarter earnings during the current fiscal. 

 For July-September, the company has posted a net profit of Rs 89 crore compared with Rs 51.7 crore in the same period last year. 

 ?The pricing pressure in the US generics market continued in the second quarter. Revenues from fluoxetine and tizanidine declined sharply leading to an overall decline in revenues from North America generics segment to Rs 29.9 crore from Rs 71.5 crore,? DRL pointed out.

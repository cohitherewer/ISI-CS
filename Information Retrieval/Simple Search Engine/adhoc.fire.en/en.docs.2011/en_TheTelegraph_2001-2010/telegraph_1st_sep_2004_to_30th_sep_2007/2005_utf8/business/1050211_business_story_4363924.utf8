The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Biotech watchdog in three years

 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Feb. 10: The government will take another three years to put in place a regulatory mechanism for the biotech industry.

 M. K. Bhan, secretary in the department of biotechnology under the central government, said burning issues like drug discovery, contract research, manufacturing and sustainability are yet to be adequately addressed in the country. ?We began the exercise for the regulatory apparatus and hope it will be in place in three years,? he said.

 The domestic biotech industry is yet to gain trust, benchmark world-class research standards and earn brand credibility, he added.

 He was addressing Bio Asia?2005, an international conference organised here today.

 Bhan said there is an urgent need to take a look at fresh avenues for venture capital and private-public partnerships to boost the biotech industry. ?There is a need to refocus on early funding for novel projects, promote adequate private-public partnerships to tap available resources and get a grip on the quality of education in domestic institutions.?

 He said Asia is emerging as a potential destination for biotech outsourcing. ?With corrections law providing for protection of IPR regulations on a par with similar laws in other countries, India is emerging as a dominant global destination.?

 Anwar Nassim, chairman of the National Commission of Biotechnology of Pakistan and founder president of the Federation of Asian Biotech Associations, was also present at the conference.

 The federation?s logo and articles of memorandum, framed to promote the co-ordinated efforts to present Asia as an outsourcing destination, was released on the occasion.

 Nassim told The Telegraph that Pakistan, too, was emerging as a destination for contract research in biotech products. ?Unlike India, we have begun our activity recently. But our industry has been successful in attracting potential research projects from Europe,? he said.

 Bio Asia-2005 will play host to 31 delegations and 300 business leaders and scientists from the life sciences industry.

 Opportunity for banks

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 15: Assocham wants the government to allow commercial banks to invest up to 20 per cent of their excess statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) funds in the equity of state-owned enterprises that have been identified for divestment.

 The government should consider offering additional stakes in PSUs to banks and retail investors, according to a white paper on Equity conversion option jointly released by Assocham and the Haribhakti research team.

 Banks have to park 25 per cent of their incremental deposits with the Reserve Bank as part of the SLR requirement. Most banks park more than the required limit since they cannot deploy the funds elsewhere.

 The study suggests that retail investors should also be given the opportunity to put their money in the equity of these PSUs. Such an investment option should be offered to them when small savings deposits come up for redemption, according to the study.

 Small savings deposits are primarily routed through post office instruments. The government can look at raising resources by divesting their stake in the PSUs by offering their shares for sale to banks and retail investors, said Shailesh Haribhakti, managing partner of Haribhakti and Company.

 The study also said that UTI-II should take over the equity portfolio of UTI-I at a discounted value to current market price when the latter is wound up by March next year. Both UTI-I and II were carved out of Unit Trust of India in 2002. UTI-I still has equity assets worth Rs 10,000 crore.

 UTI-II is a mutual fund and the study says that it can launch a specific scheme to buy the UTI-I portfolio. This will help stabilise the capital market and control of these companies would continue to remain with the Indian financial institutions.

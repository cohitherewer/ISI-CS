 Dena Bank offer at Rs 27 apiece

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 7: Dena Bank, the mid-sized nationalised bank, today fixed a price of Rs 27 per share for its second offering expected to mop up Rs 216 crore.

 The board of directors, which met today, has approved the final prospectus to be filed with the Sebi, Dena Bank informed the BSE.

 The bank is entering the capital market with a public issue of 8,00,00,000 shares. These shares will be offered at a premium of Rs 17 per share. Dena Bank had earlier fixed a price band of Rs 23-27 per share for this offering.

 The issue is scheduled for subscription on January 24 and will close on January 29. 

 With this issue, the bank?s capital base would increase to Rs 422 crore. The move is in view of its expansion plans and also to meet the stringent Basel-II capital norms to be in place by December, 2006.

 The government?s holding will come down to 51 per cent from the present 70.9 per cent after the public issue.

 Apart from the Centre?s holding, institutional investors hold about 6 per cent and the remaining 23 per cent is held by others, including about 20 per cent by the public.

 The proceeds of the issue would go towards augmenting the long-term resources of the bank, assets and business growth. It would also improve the capital adequacy ratio to over 12 per cent from the existing 10.28 per cent.

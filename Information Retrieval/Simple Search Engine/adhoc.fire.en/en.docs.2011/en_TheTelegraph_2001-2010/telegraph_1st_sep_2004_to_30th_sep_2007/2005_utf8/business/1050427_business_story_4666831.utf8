 Stake cap rethink in takeovers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 26: Industry is urging the government and regulatory authorities to back down on a provision in the takeover code that requires promoters to reduce their stake in the companies they acquire to 55 per cent.

 At present, they are permitted to hold up to 75 per cent.

 The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) and the Bar Association of India have cobbled a paper that calls for a ?multi-pronged agenda for legislative reforms of business laws?.

 The idea is to dovetail the provisions of the Companies Act, the Takeover Code and the Competition Act to ensure that domestic companies aren?t trammelled by growth-busting legislation even as they square up to face global competition.

 The biggest beef is over the proposed cap on promoters? stake at 55 per cent for listed companies. ?When the requirement of maintaining public holding for continued listing is not more than 25 per cent of the voting rights, there is no justification to bring down the ceiling from 75 per cent to 55 per cent,? Ficci said in a note issued ahead of a national conference to be held on Saturday. Industrialists will get to jaw-jaw on hot-button issues in the arena of company law at the event.

 The note argues that it is unfair to ask promoters who have built up a stake of 75 per cent or more in a company to dilute their holding, especially when they complied with all laws and regulations when building up that stake in the first place. ?It would not be fair to ask them to divest their holdings in excess of 55 per cent,? says the note.

 There are two other arguments that the note adduces to buttress its point. First, a sudden reduction in the promoters? shareholding to comply with a 55 per cent ceiling will lead to a substantial fall in share prices. Such a sale would result in a great loss to the promoters, the note says. It will also result in a lower price realisation when non-promoter shareholders ? read retail investors ? sell their shares.

 The second argument is that when the government has permitted 100 per cent foreign direct investment in several areas and 74 per cent in most other sectors, it is unfair to restrict promoters of domestic listed companies to cut back their stake to 55 per cent. However, another argument against the 55 per cent proviso is more specious: the note says that if the promoters aren?t allowed to hold more than 55 per cent, the real demand for shares of the target company will fall by 5 per cent a year and the retail investor will be the ultimate loser.

 There are a couple of other issues that industry is concerned about: it wants the number of independent directors on a company?s board to be limited to 25 per cent (and that includes nominee directors). Industry is also pushing for the introduction of a plea bargain concept that exists in the US under which companies can pay fines for financial misdemeanours without having to admit guilt.

 Leverkusen, Germany, March 15 (Reuters): German drugs and chemicals group Bayer expects strong growth in earnings this year after a momentous 2004 marked by the biggest restructuring in its 141-year history, it said on Tuesday.

 Bayer said it was aiming for a 20 per cent improvement in earnings before interest and tax from continuing operations before special items, building on the 2.032 billion euros ($2.73 billion) it achieved in 2004.

 Bayer said it was targeting sales of over 25 billion euros in 2005, amounting to currency and portfolio-adjusted growth of more than 5 per cent from continuing operations.

 The outlook sent Bayer shares up 1.8 per cent in early trading, adding to a near 12-per cent gain so far this year, but they had fallen 0.4 per cent to 26.13 euros during the day as traders said all the good news was now priced into the share.

 Analysts, who expect Bayer to benefit this year from its restructuring in 2004, were encouraged.

 ?The outlook is somewhat better than we had expected,? said Helaba Trust analyst Dennis Nacken. ?The core businesses of Bayer, for example pharma, have reported better numbers than anticipated.?

 Last year, Bayer bought a non-prescription medicine business from Switzerland?s Roche, agreed to sell its blood products unit and decided to spin off Lanxess, comprising most of Bayer?s chemicals activities and part of its polymer business.

 It also licensed out much of its US pharmaceuticals business to Schering-Plough in a move to cut costs.

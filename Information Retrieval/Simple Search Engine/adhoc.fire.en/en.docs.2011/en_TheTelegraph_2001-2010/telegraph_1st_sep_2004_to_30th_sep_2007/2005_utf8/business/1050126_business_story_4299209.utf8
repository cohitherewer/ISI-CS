 Fitch review after budget

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 25: Fitch will review India?s sovereign rating after the Union Budget is presented. However, it has reiterated that any change in this rating is constrained by the high level of the country?s fiscal deficit.

 The current rating outlook on India?s domestic and foreign currency rating (BB+) was stable and there are no plans to change it till the Union Budget was presented, Brian Coulton, director (Asia-sovereign rating), said on the sidelines of a seminar on credit market here today. This budget is crucial as it will be the first announcement for an entire fiscal by the UPA government, he added. 

 Coulton stressed on the need to bring down subsidies, broaden the tax base and privatise assets, which would release resources for investments in publc infrastructure. He said a strong commitment is needed for fiscal consolidation and the status of public finances would play a crucial role for a view on rating.

 The BB+ rating for India falls in the sub-investment grade. The hurdle is a bit higher when rating is to be upgraded to the investment grade, he added.

 According to Coulton, the combined fiscal deficit of the Centre and state governments of around 9 per cent was high compared with the levels in Asian countries. ?The consolidated fiscal deficit of around 9 per cent is quite high. Not many countries have that kind of deficit,? he observed.

 Despite such a high deficit level, Coulton pointed out that the fiscal consolidation does not seem to get high priority. Action could be taken regarding this when the economy was doing good, he added.

 He also said observers were impressed by trade liberalisation policies of the government but not with fiscal and privatisation moves.

 The country?s fiscal deficit was 4.8 per cent of the GDP in 2003-04. The government is now planning to bring this down to 4.4 per cent in the current year.

 Standard amp; Poors Ratings Services (S amp;P) had earlier revised its outlook on Indias long-term foreign currency rating to positive from stable. It, however, warned that the country?s local currency rating could be lowered if the fiscal deficit remains large and the debt burden continues to rise.

 S amp;P, while stating that India?s sovereign ratings are supported by good economic prospects, with GDP growth likely to be over 6 per cent for the medium-term, expressed that the ratings remain constrained by high public debt and serious fiscal inflexibility.

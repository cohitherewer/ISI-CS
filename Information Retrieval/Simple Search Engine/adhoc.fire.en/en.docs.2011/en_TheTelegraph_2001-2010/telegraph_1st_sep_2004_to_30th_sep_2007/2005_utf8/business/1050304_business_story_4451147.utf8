 New Delhi, March 3: LG Electronics India is splashing out Rs 60 crore on a high-decibel promotional blitz for the Indo-Pakistan cricket series that starts later this month ? and it?s hoping to rake in Rs 1200 crore in sales over the next two months. That is a huge bang for the buck ? 20 times ? but LG officials were pretty confident of pulling it off.

 ?We hope to net in a revenue of Rs 1,200 crore in these two months of our promotional campaign,? said Salil Kapoor, marketing head of LGEIL.

 LG is targeting a sales turnover of Rs 9,000 crore this year. ?If we don?t make Rs 1,200 crore, how will we reach that target,? officials asked.

 The Korean giant has roped in captains of Indian and Pakistani cricket team, Sourav Ganguly and Inzamaam Ul Haq, for its new campaign, for which it has earmarked a budget of Rs 60 crore.

 Part funding for this Rs 60-crore campaign would be from the Rs 200 crore corpus set aside for creative spends for the current fiscal. The rest will come from gift funds, said Kapoor. Speaking on the most debated issue of fringe benefit tax, he said, ?No matter what, the company does not plan to cut down its marketing expenses in the near future.?

 Cashing in on the sports fever in the country, the company has plans to turn to golf to market its high-end products.

 ?For mass products, LG will continue the association with cricket series. But for premium segment products, the company is toying with the proposal of turning to golf,? he said. Testing the waters at the moment, LG has already tied up with a golf club in Gurgaon, but until now it has no plans to rope in any golfer to endorse the brand.

 Kapoor denied reports that the company was reconsidering local manufacture of mobile handsets in Rajnandgaon near Pune.

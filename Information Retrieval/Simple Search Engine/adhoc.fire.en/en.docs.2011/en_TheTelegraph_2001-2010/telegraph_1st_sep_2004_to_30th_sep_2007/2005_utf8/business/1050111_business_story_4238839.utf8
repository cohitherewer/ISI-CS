 Merger ratio for TFL, Tata Motors at 100:8

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 10: A swap ratio of eight shares of Tata Motors for every 100 shares of Tata Finance (TFL) has been proposed for the merger of the two companies.

 The exchange ratio is based upon a valuation by chartered accountants Bansi Mehta amp; Co.

 The companies would merge under a scheme of amalgamation in Sections 391 and 394 of the Companies Act 1956. The merger would be subject to the approval of Bombay High Court and be effective from April 1. 

 The swap ratio was recommended at a meeting of the board of directors of Tata Motors and TFL today.

 The move will strengthen the vehicle financing business of Tata Finance through the dealer driven business of Bureau of Hire Purchase and Credits (BHPC), a division of Tata Motors. 

 Post-merger, TFL shareholders can also participate in the growth of the company and gain from a rise in dividend and shareholder value. 

 ?The merger will help the company grow its auto financing business and offer complete solutions in line with global trends in the auto industry. The company will be able to create a hedge against the cyclicality of the automotive business,? Tata Motors added. 

 At present, Tata Finance and BHPC finance around 17-18 per cent of Tata Motors? vehicle sales, while the global benchmark for captive finance units is 35-40 per cent of the parent?s vehicle sales. 

 The proposed merger will will help Tata Motors move towards the global benchmark.

 TFL, which was formed by Tata Industries and Tata Motors in 1984, has been involved in a restructuring process over the last three years.

 Battle of will rests on trust

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 7: Legal eagles representing R.S. Lodha today repudiated the Birla clans claim that five trusts with assets worth Rs 2400 crore had been willed away by Priyamvada Birla to the savvy chartered accountant.

 Harish Salve, senior counsel for Lodha, contended that no such trusts existed in the first place. Presenting his arguments before a division bench of the Supreme Court comprising Justices B.P. Singh and S.H. Kapadia, Salve said Priyamvadas revocation of the trusts never happened because they just didnt exist.

 He claimed that Priyamvada was the only beneficiary of the Rs 5000 crore MP Birla estate and was within her rights to will it as she deemed fit.

 She was the only beneficiary who had appropriated her money in her own manner, Salve argued, claiming there was no written clause or any other document to prove that (a) there was a trust, and (b) that the trust was irrevocable. 

 Arguments began on the petition filed by Siva Nath Prasad, who along with Lodha, V. Gauri Shanker and Sushil Kumar Daga have been accused of conspiring to seize the MP Birla estate. 

 After Priyamvadas death in July 2004, he had filed a complaint before the Alipore criminal court in Calcutta stating that Lodha had criminally conspired with other accused persons and misappropriated properties worth Rs 2400 crore invested in five trusts meant for charitable purposes. Lodha had wanted the high court to either quash the criminal suit or stay proceedings till his civil suit for probate of Priyamvadas will was decided, which the court declined. This prompted the special leave petition before the Supreme Court. 

 Salve, appearing for Lodha, Prasad and Daga, contended that the three points made out in the complaint had no ground and no footing. The complaints were: there was no entrustment on the accused; trust is irrevocable; revocation of trust in 1999 (through Priyamvadas will bequeathing the property on Lodha) was illegal.

 Salve argued if there was a trust there should have been trustees. There were no trustees. If the trust existed, it should have been for the benefit of others not for Priyamvada. But the sole beneficiary was Priyamvada and, in the absence of any written clause or trust deed, the deceased being the only beneficiary she had apportioned her properties in the manner she deemed fit. 

 Salve argued that the test of suspicious circumstances quot; in cases of will has been 15 days of the death of the person in question. In the instant case, Priyamvada had written the will in 1999 and had survived for another five years. So the legal test of suspicious circumstances would also not be available.

 Salve will continue his arguments tomorrow after which F.S. Nariman will argue for Gauri Shankar. Ram Jethmalani represents the Birlas.

 Land sale to fuel PSU recovery run

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dev: Help at hand

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The government is considering a proposal to allow loss-making public sector units to sell their surplus land and use the money to fund their revival plans as in the case of the National Textile Corporation (NTC).

 We are looking at the possibility of selling excess real estate assets with the loss-making public sector companies to raise funds for their revival, heavy industry minister Santosh Mohan Dev said at a conference of the chief executives of public sector units here today.

 He said the funds raised by selling excess land with a public sector undertaking would be ploughed back into the same company.

 The minister said the sale of land owned by public sector undertakings would be done in a transparent manner. The representatives of banks and state governments will be involved in the process. The land will be sold through open bids, he added.

 While Rs 4,697.14 crore was required for the revival of NTC, the sale of just five mills of the company in Mumbai had raked in more than Rs 2,000 crore.

 Several loss-making PSUs own land in prime cities such as Calcutta, Bangalore and Pune. With the prices of real estate skyrocketing, the land owned by these companies commands a huge premium. 

 Dev said the government would revive all the sick PSUs that were potentially viable but would have to close down those where no such possibility existed.

 In July, a part of the land owned by Hindustan Machine Tools in Bangalore was sold to raise funds for the company.

 The highest bid had come from a private player but the prospective buyer was not able to rustle up the cash so the land was sold to the government at the market price.

 While formulating its revival plan, Pune-based Hindustan Antibiotics Ltd had also said part of the funds needed for the purpose be raised from the sale of its excess land. He said the private players could be invited to help revive the sick PSUs.

 Dev said the performance of workers of sick PSUs under his ministry had improved with the payment of wages and other dues.

 Of the 27 loss-making PSUs that had received assistance from the government to pay salaries and other dues, 12 have started making enough money to pay their employees on their own, he said.

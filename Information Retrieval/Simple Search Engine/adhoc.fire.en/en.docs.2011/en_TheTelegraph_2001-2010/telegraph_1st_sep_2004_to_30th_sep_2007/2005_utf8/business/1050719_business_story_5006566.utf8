 Ispat calls off Turkey deal

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 18: Global Steel Holdings Ltd, a company floated by the Ispat Group promoters Pramod and Vinod Mittal specially for overseas acquisitions, has called off an agreement to buy the Turkish steel company Izmir Demir Celik. 

 Global Steel was supposed to pay Rs 350 crore or $78.4 million and make an open offer, which would have cost the company an equivalent amount, to pick up a 54.68 per cent stake in Celik from Turkeys largest private bank, Turkiye Is Bankasi, which announced divestment of its Celtik holding in June 2003 following a government directive asking Turkish banks to reduce their industrial exposures. 

 Though Global Steel did not divulge any reason for its backing out from the deal, sources said the company did not find the proposition attractive after due diligence.

 Celik is a rolling mill with an annual production capacity of only 0.8 million tonnes. Moreover, Global Steel will have no security over raw material. At this price, the deal was not lucrative. There could be better opportunities elsewhere, industry sources pointed out.

 The Turkish bank said it might take legal recourse to the issue. It is learnt that Global Steel has also been picking up legal brains on the subject.

 The Turkish electric arc furnace-based steel plant, which manufactures long products, sales 75 per cent outside Turkey, mainly other European countries. It posted a net profit of TL 51.36 million (Rs 164 crore) for 2004, recovering from a TL 14.42 million (Rs 46 crore) net loss in the previous year.

 Global Steel, on the other hand, has grown in the last two years either by acquiring or by signing up management control through leases and concessions for steel making, raw materials and mining capacities outside India ? in the Philippines, Nigeria, Bosnia and Libya. The company last bought out a 2.2-million tonne steel plant in Bulgaria in April this year at a cost of about $300 million or Rs 1,300 crore.

 The Celik development stands out in stark contrast against this background.

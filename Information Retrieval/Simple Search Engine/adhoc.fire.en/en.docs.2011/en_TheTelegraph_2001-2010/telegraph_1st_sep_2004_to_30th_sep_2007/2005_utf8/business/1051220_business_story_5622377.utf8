 Unilever takes stock parity plunge

 Amsterdam, Dec. 20 (Reuters): Consumer products group Unilever NV/Plc will keep its dual-listed structure but make its London- and Amsterdam-listed shares equal in value, the Anglo-Dutch firm said on Monday.

 Unilever, under pressure to create one share listing and one headquarters, said that it would split its Amsterdam-listed shares and consolidate its London shares to harmonise their values.

 This will increase the transparency and clarity of the shares, Unilever chairman Antony Burgmans told reporters. 

 The companys shares were down 1.0 per cent at 58.15 euros at 9:33 am on Euronext Amsterdam, near the midpoint of their four-month range between 55.80 and 60.80. 

 The London-listed shares were off 1.3 per cent at 575 pence. 

 Asked if Unilevers board had considered streamlining the companys structure, Burgmans said the company had decided to keep the dual-parent, dual-listing structure but to strengthen it. 

 We decided that the current structure would serve our interests and shareholders best, he said. 

 Unilever also said it would allow shareholders to nominate board candidates. 

 The company, which makes products ranging from Lipton teas to Skippy peanut butter, eliminated its dual-management structure earlier this year to answer investors concerns that the configuration slowed its response to competition.

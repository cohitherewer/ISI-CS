 ITC deal in tune with court view

 Chidambaram: Clearing the air

 New Delhi, April 5: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the settlement reached between the Union government and ITC Ltd to close the Rs 803-crore excise evasion case was ?entirely in accordance with the suggestions from the Supreme Court?.

 He said the cabinet had earlier approved the settlement reached with ITC last month. This envisaged the government foregoing Rs 453 in excise arrears from ITC in return for the firm agreeing not to seek return of the Rs 350-crore part payment it had made to the government in the excise evasion case. ?The cabinet had approved my proposal that we accept the settlement,? he said.

 The minister said the government agreed to a settlement after ITC approached it for one. The government?s charge against ITC was that it had colluded with retailers in selling cigarettes at a price higher than that printed on the package and thus cheated the state of revenues.

 Raids on ITC offices had unearthed documents that seemed to support the government?s case. Consequently, the government asked ITC to pay duty for the period between March 1, 1983, and February 28, 1987.

 However, in early 2004, the Supreme Court had laid aside the government order asking ITC to pay excise back dues on technical grounds. The Centre consequently came out with an ordinance, which remedied the defect and would have forced ITC to pay up the balance amount, when the tobacco major approached the government for a settlement.

 Revenue officials claim the government had let the ordinance that annulled the Supreme Court ruling lapse, because of flaws in its drafting.

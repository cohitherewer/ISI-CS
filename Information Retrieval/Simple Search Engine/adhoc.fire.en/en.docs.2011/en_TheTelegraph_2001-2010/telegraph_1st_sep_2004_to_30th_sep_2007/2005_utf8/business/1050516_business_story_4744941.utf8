 THE GREAT ESCAPE

 For corporate high-fliers, foreign assignments are not just bonus or mere fun. If meticulously planned, such trips can make you eligible for the enviable non-resident Indian (NRI) status that grants you tax exemption on the whole or part of your income earned abroad.

 We take you through some case studies to find out what makes someone eligible for the NRI status and the amount of tax levied on the money earned.

 Preetam, a resident 

 Indian, works for a technology firm and is going abroad 

 on an assignment. Does he get an NRI status?

 He would be treated as an NRI if his stay in India during that year is less than 182 days.

 As he is currently 

 a resident of India in possession of a PAN, should he intimate 

 the income tax authorities about his moving out of India?

 Generally, the visa issuing authority would insist on producing a tax clearance certificate from an individual leaving India for a long period. Other than this, there is no specific requirement under the Income Tax Act to inform the tax department. 

 Will the payment 

 made by the company abroad be taxable in India?

 The payment made by the company abroad is usually not taxable once the status of NRI is achieved. However, certain income is deemed to accrue or arise in India even though it may actually be received outside India. 

 Since he is employed with an Indian company and has been deputed abroad, the payment made to him is deemed to accrue and arise in India. So he is liable to pay tax on this income. If he joins a local company abroad, then he is not liable to pay tax on that income.

 Also, if he does not achieve an NRI status, he is liable to pay tax in the country. 

 Suppose in between he 

 comes to India for two months and is paid salary here. Will 

 he have to file returns and pay tax on such income?

 He is liable to pay tax in respect of any income earned in India and will have to furnish the return of income.

 Suppose he earns 

 some money abroad from an entity based in that country. 

 Will he have to pay tax on that?

 Any income received or accrued outside India for an NRI is exempt from tax, be it from an entity based in India or abroad. 

 Reema is at a senior 

 management level with an MNC and often jet-sets across the 

 globe. Does she get an NRI status? 

 To achieve NRI or resident status, the stay within the country need not be continuous. Thus, overall, if she stays in India for less than 182 days in that year, she will be treated as an NRI.

 What about the 

 income which she earns? Is it taxable in the country?

 If she does not achieve NRI status, then whatever income she earns, whether in the country or abroad, will be taxable in India. However, once she achieves NRI status, she will be entitled to tax exemption as applicable for Preetam.

 Suppose she does 

 not achieve an NRI status, which means she will have to 

 pay tax in India. Also, tax was deducted at source from 

 her salary abroad. Will she be subject to double taxation?

 If India has a double taxation avoidance treaty (as in the case of India and US) with the country where tax was deducted, she will be eligible for tax credit on the amount paid to the foreign government. 

 Rohit is a seafarer 

 and works on an Indian ship. Is he treated as having left 

 India for employment?

 Earlier, only the crew of a foreign ship was treated as having left India for employment, while the crew on an Indian ship was not. However, now the provisions of ascertaining resident or NRI status has been made applicable to the crew of Indian ships also.

 Thus, for Rohit too all the provisions will be applicable as it is for Preetam and Reema.

 Anushka goes to visit 

 her sister who stays abroad and stays out of the country 

 for seven months. Does she become an NRI?

 For individuals not leaving India for the purpose of employment, they are resident if they stay in the country for at least 182 days in the current fiscal or 365 days in the preceding four financial years and 60 days in the current fiscal.

 Thus, although she is eligible for an NRI status according to the first criterion, if she satisfies the second criterion, she remains a resident Indian.

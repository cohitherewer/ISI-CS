The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Pay more to smoke

 Costly Drag

 Calcutta, March 18: Cigarette makers have jacked up the retail price of leading brands following the Union budget proposal to increase the specific rate by about 10 per cent and impose a surcharge of 10 per cent ad valorem duties.

 ITC, the market leader has increased prices of its popular brand, Wills Navy Cut, from Rs 23 (pack of 10) to Rs 25. The prices of Gold Flake (king size) has been increased from Rs 56 to Rs 59 (pack of 20).

 The company has also increased prices of the popular Wills Flake brand from Rs 14 to Rs 14.50 for a pack of 10.

 Similarly, GTC has raised the prices of the Chancellor brand from Rs 12 to Rs 14, while VST has increased the rates from Rs 12.50 to Rs 14, all for a pack of 10.

 Interestingly, none of the companies have passed on the entire duty burden to the consumer, indicating that there could be some pressure on the margin for these companies.

 The hike has, however, not made the retail sellers happy. They used to enjoy a greater margin by selling sticks.

 For instance, a stick of Navy Cut was sold at Rs 2.50 while the pack cost Rs 23. A Gold Flake stick was sold at Rs 3 while the pack was charged Rs 56. The industry expects that the budget proposal will help the government mop up an additional Rs 600 crore in revenue for the next fiscal.

 On an average, the excise duty on cigarette is around 130 per cent on the ex-factory price.

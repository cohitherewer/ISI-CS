 Tatas ink Bastar steel pact

 Raipur, June 5 (PTI): The Chhattisgarh government has signed a memorandum of understanding with Tata Steel to set up a 5-million tonne integrated steel plant at Bastar.

 The pact to set up the Rs 10,000-crore plant was signed by state principal secretary (industry) Shivraj Singh and Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman on Saturday in the presence of chief minister Raman Singh.

 This is the first major step to industrialise the Bastar region, which is full of iron ore, Singh said.

 Muthuraman said the feasibility study and other related works will start soon. The plant will have annual capacity of 2 million tonnes in the first phase, which would be completed in 48 months. The project would also develop captive iron ore mines to meet the plants requirements, he said.

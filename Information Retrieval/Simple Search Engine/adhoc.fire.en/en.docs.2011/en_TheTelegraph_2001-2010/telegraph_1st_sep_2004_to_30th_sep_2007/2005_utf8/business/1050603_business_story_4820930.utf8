 Microsoft logs in with Hindi XP

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 2: Microsoft India today launched Windows XP Starter Edition, a software designed for beginners in the home-PC segment. Touted as the lowest priced version of the Windows XP operating system, it is designed to provide easy access to computing.

 However, the Rs 18,900 tag for the base model PC is unlikely to please communications minister Dayanidhi Maran, who, in September, had urged Microsoft, HCL and HP to cut prices of personal computers by 20 per cent.

 Maran had told IT majors that a sub-Rs 10,000 PC is essential for the proliferation of broadband usage.

 Microsoft has partnered with HCL and Intel to develop PCs with Windows XP Starter Edition. 

 Microsoft will first market these PCs in Uttaranchal.

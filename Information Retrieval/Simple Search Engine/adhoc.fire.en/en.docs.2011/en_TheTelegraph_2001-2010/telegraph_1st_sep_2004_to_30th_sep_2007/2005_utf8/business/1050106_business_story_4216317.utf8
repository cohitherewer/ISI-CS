 Scheme to help close defunct companies

 Gupta: Positive approach

 New Delhi, Jan. 5 (PTI): Saddled with over 3-lakh defunct companies, the government today said a new scheme would be announced this month to enable promoters to close such entities in a ?hassle-free? manner.

 ?We will announce within this month a simplified exit scheme for defunct companies,? said Prem Chand Gupta, companies affairs minister.

 The objective is to not only to simplify the complex and cumbersome exit scheme but also to reduce the burden of paper work on both the government and the industry, he said.

 ?As of now the industry spends about Rs 400 crore annually in compiling paper work under the Companies Law and the Registrar of Companies at various offices has to keep a record of 15 crore documents,? Gupta said.

 As of now there are 6.4-lakh registered companies and about half of these are not operational for some reason or other. ?We are giving them a chance to exit,? he said.

 Under the proposed scheme, a promoter would have to give a self declaration before an Oath Commission along with accounts of last three years for exit in case there were no assets or liabilities, he said.

 The minister said he wanted to make the environment corporate friendly. As part of these efforts, he was striving to provide a simple exit route as earlier schemes were not giving the desirable results, ?may be due to complex procedures?, he added.

 The government had received 25,000 applications under the earlier scheme which ended on March 31, 2004. But, only half the cases were settled, Gupta said.

 For a speedy disposal of such applications, the procedure has been simplified in such a way that promoters of such companies do not need to go to courts at all, he said.

 Asked if the new exit scheme would also help the front companies of large corporate houses to come clean, the minister said the new exit scheme would encompass all defunct firms.

 Vedanta plans Orissa alumina hub

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Agarwal: Big plans

 Mumbai, Feb. 10: Vedanta Resources Plc, the London-listed metals and mining company, is setting up a 5-lakh-tonne aluminium smelter along with 1,000 mw of associated power facilities at Jharsuguda in Orissa at an investment of Rs 7,000 crore.

 The project, which is expected to provide employment to over 3,000 persons, will be implemented in two phases over the next three to five years. 

 In the first phase, a 2.45-lakh-tonne smelter with associated power facilities will be set up. Initial project development work, including acquisition of land, feasibility studies and government approval process is under way.

 ?When we talk about Orissa, the people world over understand Nalco. However, our plant is on a much bigger scale than Nalco,? Agarwal said.

 This investment is in addition to the 1.4-million-tonne alumina refinery at an estimated investment of $800 million being set up by the group at Lanjigarh in Orissa.

 According to Anil Agarwal, founder amp; CEO of Vedanta: ?This is a major step in our vision to create one million tonnes of aluminium capacity and also establish India as a major player in the global resource industry.?

 Agarwal added that Vedanta has already brought in foreign direct investment of $1.5 billion to fund its existing projects. It is now engaged in a Rs 10,000-crore expansion plan, which is nearing completion. 

 These plans include increasing copper production to 3 lakh tonnes from 1.80 lakh tonnes at Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu, zinc production to 4 lakh tonnes from 2.20 lakh tonnes at Chanderiya in Rajasthan, aluminium production to 3.45 lakh tonnes from 1 lakh tonnes at Korba (Chattisgarh), apart from the greenfield alumina refinery in Orissa.

 After the completion of these projects, Vedanta will be amongst the top five producers of refined copper, top six producers of zinc and top 10 producers of aluminium.

 Agarwal said the aluminium smelter will be financed through internal accruals. Resources may also be raised from the domestic and international markets. However, senior company officials added that the necessity of raising some funds through debt is unlikely to occur. 

 ?We feel the smelter can be funded through internal accruals. However, it is still early at this point to give details on the financing pattern,? the official pointed out.

 Vedanta has not decided on the group entities that would part of the project. Vedanta Aluminium, which is implementing the alumina project in Orissa, is 70.5 per cent owned by Twinstar Holdings, Mauritius (in which Vedanta Resources holds 100 per cent), while the rest is held by Sterlite Industries (India).

 Even as Vedanta is pumping in huge sums of money in the metal segment, efforts are on to consolidate the group structure. This will be done by increasing direct ownership in underlying businesses.

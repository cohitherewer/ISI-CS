 IBP profit plummets to Rs 59 crore

 Behuria: Taking a hit

 New Delhi, May 18: The net profit of IBP has plunged 73 per cent to Rs 58.87 crore for the financial year ended March 31, 2005 from Rs 215 crore during the previous year.

 IBP chairman S. Behuria said the decline in profit was mainly due to under-recoveries of Rs 352 crore in kerosene and LPG and Rs. 211 crore in petrol and diesel. 

 The non-revision of retail selling prices in sync with the price changes in the international market has resulted in the Rs 563 crore under-recoveries. 

 However, the public sector oil and chemicals marketing company has been able to post a marginal profit primarily because Rs 85.48-crore arrears were recovered from Oil Co-ordination Committee.

 Behuria said the board of directors has recommended a 100 per cent dividend to shareholders for 2004-05. 

 He said IBP had commissioned 511 new retail outlets in 2004-05 as part of its aggressive retail expansion. At the end of the fiscal under review, the companys total number of outlets stands at 3,272, which represent over 12 per cent of the retail oil outlets in the country. 

 The company, however, has reported a 28 per cent increase in turnover at Rs 13,663,90 crore, the highest ever since inception, in the last fiscal compared with Rs 10,711.12 crore in 2003-04.

 Despite huge under-recoveries and capital expenditure on retail network expansion, the company still remains debt-free.

 To prop up its brand value, IBP has drawn up a project horizon plan covering 250 top-of-the-line outlets for standardising and improving visibility. The facilities at these outlets would be on par with international standards. IBP will also provide special training to the dealers at these outlets for improved customer services.

 The oil PSU is also in the process of introducing a loyalty programme for its customers, covering both the highway and the urban sectors. The estimated cost of these initiatives has been estimated at Rs. 110 crore.

 Both IBP and Indian Oil are rapidly expanding their retail base, striving to attain mutual synergy in their respective areas of operation. 

New marketing plan

 The two companies have worked out a strategic retail-marketing plan to ensure that there is no duplication of facilities and resources are optimally utilised by both IOC and IBP through a synergy and rationalisation of facilities.

 The supply of petroleum products from Indian Oil depots and terminals to IBP has also been logistically rationalised. IBP plans to market Indian Oils branded auto fuels Xtrapremium petrol and Xtramile diesel at its retail outlets. 

 IBP will, however, continue to market its lubricant brand, IBP Red, from its outlets. On the proposal for merger of IBP with Indian Oil, Behuria said, it was awaiting the Centres approval.

 Another committee to weigh oil firm merger

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 26: Union petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today announced the constitution of another advisory committee to develop an integrated structure for public sector oil companies. 

 The move comes within weeks of a high-level panel opposing the merger of oil PSUs.

 Briefing a parliamentary consultative committee, Aiyar said the committee had been set up on the advice of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 The VK Krishnamurthy committee report on synergy in energy would be the starting point for the new panel. 

 However, he did not clarify whether the panel would merely fine tune the recommendations of the Krishnamurthy committee or suggest new roadmaps.

 The committee would also advise the petroleum ministry from time to time on various issues confronting the Indian hydrocarbon sector.

 The Krishnamurthy panel had envisaged a closer co-operation between Oil India Ltd (OIL) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).

 It had recommended that OIL should play a greater role in foreign acquisitions of oil and gas fields with the support of IOCs financial muscle.

 The committee had, however, ruled out merger of state-run oil companies to create one or two big firms. It had emphasised that oil companies should function on the basis of their area of core competence. 

 It had recommended restructuring of the ONGC board by empowering vice-presidents to oversee offshore and onshore exploration activities. Besides, the ONGC chairman-cum-managing directors powers should be considerably reduced in operational matters so that he can co-ordinate policy issues better. 

 The report had said merging oil firms on the lines of global firms, such as Chevron-Texaco and Exxon-Mobil, did not apply to the Indian context as they were undertaken mainly to reduce the expensive manpower. 

 In India, where there was a need to create jobs and the cost of manpower is much lower, this model would not be relevant, it had said.

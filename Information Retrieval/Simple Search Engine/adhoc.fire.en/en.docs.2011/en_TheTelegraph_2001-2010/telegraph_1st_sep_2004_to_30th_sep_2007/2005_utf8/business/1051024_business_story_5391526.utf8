The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 HSBC, Citi on Posco project funding trail

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Oct. 23: Citigroup and HSBC have evinced interest in funding Poscos proposed steel project.

 The Korean steel company, which is developing a 12-million-tonne (mt) steel plant, mining facility, port and allied infrastructure in Orissa, will invest a whopping Rs 50,000 crore in the entire project.

 The first phase of the plant ? a 3-mt slab-making facility ? will be up and ready by 2010. 

 Tae-Hyun Jeong, deputy managing director and head of the Posco India project, told The Telegraph that the international banking community was keen to participate in the project.

 The company is yet to shape up the financial model ? like the debt-equity ratio ? for the project. It could be funded through a debt-equity ratio of 3:2. The estimated cost of the first phase is about $3 billion.

 Posco, the fifth largest steel maker in the world, is listed on the bourses of New York and London. Its shares will soon be traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Moreover, the company has a strong cash flow over $4 billion to support its expansion plan.

 However, Posco did not rule out the possibility of listing its wholly-owned Indian subsidiary.

 Asked if Indian investors would get a chance to grow with the Korean major here, Jeong said it would be considered following the completion of the first phase. In the initial days, the parent company will support our expansion programme.

 The Dang committee, set up by the steel ministry to streamline the existing iron policy, has recommended that international steel companies must list their Indian subsidiaries on local bourses.

 If the recommendations are accepted by the government, Indian subsidiaries of Mittal Steel and Posco will be forced to list on domestic stock exchanges.

 Mine development

 Posco India is expecting the mining licence from Orissa by December. This will enable the company to start exploration. The state government has asked Posco to work with domestic companies, leading to the exclusion of Australian mining firm BHP Billiton from mine development.

 Even as this restriction was not part of the MoU signed between the Orissa government and Posco in June, the company has decided to oblige the local authority.

 Posco has identified two mines in Keonjhar and Sundergarh districts with nearly 600 million tonnes of proven reserves and has approached the state for early notification for land acquisition, adds PTI.

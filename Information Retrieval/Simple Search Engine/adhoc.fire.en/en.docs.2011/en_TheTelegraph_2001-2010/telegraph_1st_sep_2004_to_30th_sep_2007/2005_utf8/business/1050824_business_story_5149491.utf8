 New Delhi, Aug. 23: HCL Technologies today posted an unimpressive 1.08 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 329.27 crore for the year ended June 30 compared with Rs 325.72 crore recorded in the previous year.

 The companys board of directors, however, appeased the shareholders by recommending a 200 per cent dividend at Rs 4 per share having a face value of Rs 2.

 HCL Techs total income for the year has increased by 20.02 per cent to Rs 1530.03 crore from Rs 1274.74 crore in 2003-04.

 The group registered a consolidated net profit of Rs 618.72 crore for the reporting year against Rs 686.23 crore achieved the year-ago. Consolidated total income grew to Rs 3471.23 crore from Rs 3040.20 crore.

 In the next three years, we are expecting a growth of 30-40 per cent in topline and EBITA, HCL Tech chairman Shiv Nadar said.

 For the quarter ended June 30, HCL Technologies total income increased to Rs 424.09 crore from Rs 343.39 crore in the same period last year. A reclassification of other income brought down the quarterly net profit of the company for the fourth quarter by 19.3 per cent to Rs 161.9 crore from the year-ago figure.

 HCLs BPO services recorded a growth of 81 per cent in revenues on year-on-year basis, while its software services revenues grew by 9.5 per cent during quarter. The business has crossed the $100 million mark in the current financial year. 

 The company also announced that its total clients on June 30 were 490. This included 66 Fortune 500 companies and 137 companies with a turnover of more than $1 million. It added 19 new clients during April-June quarter.

FM keeps in mind social concerns

Left Turn / Nilotpal Basu

Budget 2005-06 was the first major test for finance 

minister P. Chidambaram to demonstrate his commitment to the National Common Minimum 

Programme. We from the Left had made specific suggestions to enhance outlays for 

the social sector during the pre-budget consultations with him, particularly in 

education, health, employment generation and agriculture by around Rs 50,000 crore 

in keeping with the NCMP. 

Though falling short of expectations in terms of the 

quantum of outlays, we are happy that he has at least initiated a forward movement 

in funding education and healthcare sectors. However, the same cannot be said 

about the funding of the employment generation programme. While around Rs 20,000 

crore should have been the basic allocation for financing the programme, the actual 

allocation falls short by almost 50 per cent. 

Since the programme is sought to be funded in part 

through foodgrains, the associated problems related to the transfer of grain, 

given the infrastructure bottlenecks like shortage of rakes, would make it difficult 

to ensure timely delivery. Cash transfers to the states would have been better 

instead. 

Similarly, the proposals related to agriculture are 

high on decibel but low on substance. Moreover, the emphasis on agriculture also 

appears to be misplaced. With the continuing decline in per capita food availability 

the emphasis on food security is conspicuous by its absence, whereas a lot has 

been said about crop diversification. Food security continues to be the most critical 

element of our agricultural economy. 

The Left parties had been very specific on the question 

of mobilisation of resources by suggesting a 1.5 per cent increase in the tax-GDP 

ratio. The budget falls short of that. Given the fact that there has been a revenue 

shortfall of around Rs 11,000 crore in 2004-05, the optimistic tax mobilisation 

targets of the finance minister may turn out to be overestimates. 

Moreover, given the huge enhancement in the defence 

budget last year, which was to fund an accumulated lag, the further enhancement 

of about Rs 6,000 crore this year seems to be on the higher side, even when one 

keeps in mind the national security considerations. 

The other noteworthy aspect of the tax mobilisation 

effort is the minister?s inability to touch the ?hot? money flows by the FIIs, 

which is exacerbating the volatility of the capital market. Even while suggesting 

some token anti-tax evasion measures, he has failed to extend the same principle 

on foreign exchange outflows. The proposals on financial sector reforms, particularly 

on pension and banking reforms, are sources of concern. One needs to ask whether 

it is wise to allow foreign entities to control such huge resources.

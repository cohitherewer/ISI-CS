 McLeod Russel buys Doom Dooma

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Khaitan: Big deal

 Calcutta, Dec. 13: McLeod Russel India Limited today signed a deal to acquire Hindustan Levers Doom Dooma Tea Company. 

 The acquisition ? which is part of the BM Khaitan groups plans to make McLeod Russel a 100-million-kg tea company ? will cost Rs 69 crore. 

 With Doom Dooma within its fold, McLeod Russel will become a 70-million-kg tea producing company. McLeod Russel also buys another 5 million kg from bought leaf factories.

 Doom Dooma Tea Company owns seven estates in Tinsukia district of Assam with a planted area of 3100 hectares and three factories to process tea. The average output of these estates is six million kg. The tea estates employ 6,000 people.

 With this acquisition, we are only 25 million kg short of our target of becoming a 100-million-kg company. The tea gardens of Doom Dooma are in the quality belt of Assam and are in close proximity to our estates. Its a good buy for us, McLeod Russel vice-chairman Deepak Khaitan said.

 The company will finance the deal through a mix of debt and internal accruals. While 50 per cent of the cost will be met through internal accruals, the rest will be funded by debt, Khaitan said. 

 ICICI Bank was the merchant banker for McLeod Russel, while DSP Merrill Lynch represented HLL.

 The company will need shareholders approval for the deal and the transaction is expected to be completed by January 2006. It hopes to increase exports to 28 million kg from 20 million kg after this acquisition.

 McLeod Russel did not rule out a merger of Doom Dooma with itself. My intention is to merge Doom Dooma. However, I do not know when and how it will happen, Khaitan said. 

 The company is also preparing a roadmap to retire high-cost debt of Rs 400 crore. The company wants to bring down debt to Rs 200 crore. The roadmap will be ready by April-May 2006.

 The share capital of McLeod Russel is Rs 50 crore and the promoters together own 60 per cent. The EBIDTA of the company is expected to be Rs 75 crore in 2005-06, which will increase to Rs 90 crore in the next fiscal.

 We are looking at various options of how to bring down this debt. We may raise money through instruments like placement of shares. We are also considering selling three of our weak gardens in Dooars. Moreover, we strongly feel the prices of tea will go up and will generate better revenues for us, Khaitan said. 

 The company is on the lookout for gardens in India. There are more opportunities in India than abroad. We have, for the time being, put on hold our plans for overseas acquisition, he said.

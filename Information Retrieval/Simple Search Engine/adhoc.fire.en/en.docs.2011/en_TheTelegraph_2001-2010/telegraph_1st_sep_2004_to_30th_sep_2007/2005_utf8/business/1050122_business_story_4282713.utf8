 eBay disappoints investors

 CHRIS GAITHER AND TOM PETRUNO

 San Francisco, Jan. 21: eBay Inc?s shares plunged 19 per cent on Thursday, a day after the online auction giant?s quarterly results fell short of Wall Street?s earnings expectations for the first time ever.

 Besides missing analysts? consensus profit projection ? by a penny per share ? the San Jose company also cut its earnings forecast for 2005.

 eBay?s stock plunged $19.72 to $83.33 on Nasdaq, its steepest one-day decline since November 2000. The company went public in September 1998.

 In reports with such titles as ?A Few Chinks in the Armour? and ?Losing Near-Term Mojo?, analysts questioned whether the company?s shrunken profit outlook and earnings miss was a blip in an otherwise stellar run ? or a sign that eBay?s growth was losing steam.

 eBay has been one of the market?s biggest stars of this decade.

 Although the shares dived 47 per cent in 2000 ? when the dot-com bubble burst ? they rose in 2001 and 2002, even as the rest of the Internet sector continued to tumble. The company?s stock rocketed in 2003 and 2004, far outpacing the rest of the market.

 In all, the stock gained 272 per cent from the end of 1999 to the end of 2004, compared with a loss of 47 per cent for the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index.

 eBay still cranks out profits. It earned $205.4 million, or 30 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, a 44 per cent jump. Revenue also rose 44 per cent to $935.8 million. Full-year profit soared 76 per cent to $778.2 million.

 However, slowing growth in eBay?s two biggest markets, the United States and Germany, spooked some analysts.

 Whether the fourth-quarter slowdown ?was a one-time event or indicative of increasingly difficult structural issues facing eBay will not be known with certainty for at least another quarter or two,? wrote Safa Rashtchy, an analyst with Piper Jaffray, who lowered his stock rating to ?market perform? from ?outperform?.

 eBay spokesman Hani Durzy said, ?We were very pleased with the final quarter of what we thought was an exceptional year.?

 Yet analysts had been more bullish on the company?s prospects for 2005, forecasting a profit that was almost a dime per share more than what eBay said Wednesday to expect.

 If eBay?s 2005 earnings hit the low end of the target range the company gave Wednesday ? $1.37 a share ? they would be up 20 per cent from the $1.14 a share earned last year.

 By contrast, the average blue-chip company is expected to post earnings growth of 10.5 per cent this year, based on analysts? estimates compiled by Thomson First Call.

 Investors typically are willing to pay more, relative to underlying earnings, for shares of faster-growing companies. But even at its sharply lower price of $83.33, eBay?s stock is valued at 61 times this year?s estimated earnings.

 That is more than three times the average blue-chip stock?s price-to-earnings ratio of 17, for a company that is growing about twice as fast.

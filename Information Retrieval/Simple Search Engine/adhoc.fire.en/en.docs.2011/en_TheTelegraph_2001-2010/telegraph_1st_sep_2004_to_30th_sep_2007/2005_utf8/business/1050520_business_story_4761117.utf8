 Calcutta, May 19: Oracle has adopted a four-pronged strategy to capture the top slot in enterprise applications business in the Asia-Pacific region.

 The company will target new segments, capitalise on the demand for an integrated information architecture and exploit the opportunity in the mid-level market. Oracle will also implement Project Fusion to integrate the products of PeopleSoft, JD Edwards with its own offerings.

 Krishan Dhawan, managing director of Oracle India, said, In the last one year, we have reorganised our sales and delivery mechanism to focus on applications. The benefits will be evident this year.

 The company has acquired 50 new clients in India in the first nine months of operations this year compared with 40 during June to May 2004. During the period under review, Oracle Asia-Pacific has reported a 24 per cent growth in new applications licence revenues. 

 Following the acquisition of PeopleSoft in December, Oracle has strengthened its presence. The enterprise applications business grew twice that of SAP, which is the market leader.

 While Oracles business is growing in telecom, financial and manufacturing segments, the software major is targeting new areas like dairy.

 The integrated information architecture creates a single source of information for organisations, said Dhawan. With our combined strengths, we are capable of providing data management and a range of applications to suit every environment.

 Kopran looking for global partners

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 11: Kopran Ltd, the Rs 183-crore pharmaceutical company, has decided to focus more on the international market than the domestic market. In keeping with that, the company is contemplating overseas marketing alliances for its formulations. 

 According to the companys intimation to the Stock Exchange, Mumbai (BSE), these steps are part of its financial and business restructuring. 

 Explaining the reasons for its shift in market focus, the company said the international generic market at present was estimated at $50 billion and was expected to touch $100 billion by 2010 with drugs worth billions of dollars going off patent in the next few years. 

 Accordingly, the company plans to shift its emphasis from the domestic to the international markets. To accomplish this, we plan to enter into strategic alliances for marketing our branded pharmaceutical formulations, the Kopran release said.

 It added that another huge market opportunity was lying in the herbal healthcare market. Here, the company intends to have a large range of over the counter (OTC) products, which are at present being marketed under the SMYLE brand. 

 There will be more emphasis on marketing our SMYLE branded products in the international market. The recent change in the patent regime is expected to help the company to increase its OTC sales of herbal products, it added.

 The company is also cleaning up its balance sheet. The company had earlier undergone a Corporate Debt Restructuring scheme. However, the debt servicing costs were not reduced substantially. It has now assigned a major part of its debt (Rs 130 crore) to Clearwater Capital Partners India Ltd following which the interest burden has come down. The shareholders of the company have approved allotment of 1.2 crore equity warrants to Clearwater Capital Partners at a price of Rs 74.55 per share. The promoters, too, have subscribed to another 30 lakh warrants at the same price.

 This debt restructuring through a one-time settlement with most of its existing lenders will help the company bounce back into the black, the company said.

 Kopran said it would continue to develop non-infringing processes as well as its own process patents through its subsidiary, Kopran Research Laboratories, and tie up with marketing companies in the US and Europe.

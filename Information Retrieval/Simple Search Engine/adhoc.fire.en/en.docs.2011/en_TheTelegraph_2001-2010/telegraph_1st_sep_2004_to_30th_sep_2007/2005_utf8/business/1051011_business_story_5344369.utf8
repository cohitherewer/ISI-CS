 Coal venture in the offing

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Oct. 10: Tata Steel is keen to set up a joint venture company with Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL), a Coal India subsidiary, to develop coking coal mines in West Jharia Coalfields.

 The venture is likely to entail an investment of Rs 500 crore. Tata Steels move comes in the wake of uncertainty in availability of metallurgical grade coking coal across the world.

 Partha S. Bhattacharyya chairman and managing director of BCCL said, Both Steel Authority of India Limited and Tata Steel are keen to participate in the joint venture. We are currently evaluating their proposals. A decision will be taken shortly.

 He added that a screening committee, set up in 1998, had voted in favour of Tata Steel as the joint venture partner.

 However, one thing is clear that the joint venture partner will have to bear the major chunk of the investment. The equity structure of the JV company has not yet been worked out.

 The proposed joint venture will undertake mining at its virgin coal reserves in Kapuria, which is near BCCLs existing mines in the West Jharia coalfields. 

 The proposed venture will mine about two million tonnes of coking coal per annum. BCCL intends to clinch the deal by March 2006. The coal is at a deeper level and the task is huge, the BCCL chief added.

 Bhattacharyya also unfolded BCCLs plan to increase its production. In the current year, the CIL subsidiary is investing Rs 300 crore to enhance production by another three million tonnes in the current financial year. The company has 62 underground mines and 16 opencast mines within its fold.

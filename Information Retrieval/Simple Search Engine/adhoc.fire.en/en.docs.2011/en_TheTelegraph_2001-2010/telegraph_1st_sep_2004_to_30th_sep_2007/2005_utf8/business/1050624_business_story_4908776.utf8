 ONGC readies war chest for Assam

 S. P. S. PANNU 

 Drill begins

 New Delhi, June 23: Oil amp; Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has readied a Rs 2,000-crore kitty for investment in oil exploration and production in Assam during the current financial year. However, the investment will be made only if the state government ensures sufficient security for the oil major.

 Senior ONGC officials fret that frequent bandhs and strikes in the state have been disrupting drilling work for fresh oil discoveries as well as the development of existing fields. 

 ONGC teams working in remote areas find themselves at the receiving end of political agitation. 

 ?The three-day bandh last month brought work to a standstill,? a senior ONGC official pointed out. 

 ?While ONGC installations were under siege, the state government refused to come to our rescue. We cannot put in our best in such an environment. There is an urgent need to create a stable socio-political environment without which economic activity cannot pick up in the state,? he added. 

 Cease work in the ageing oilfields during political unrest involves a very high economic risk as there is a danger that the oil may stop flowing in and the wells could go dry. If this happens, it would result in a permanent loss to the state and the country.

 The crude output from the Assam fields has stagnated over the last few years and oil has to be brought from outside the state to run the refineries. There is an urgent need to step up the oil hunt and replace the old oil rigs with new ones. Development of related infrastructure and the use of more high-tech equipment are also of immense importance to increase output. 

 A conducive political environment is also a prerequisite for this task. 

 According to senior ONGC officials, local youngsters take advantage of the weak law and order situation in the state and place unreasonable demands on the oil companies. 

 These range from construction of hospitals, roads, bridges and schools. These are projects to be taken up by the state government. Apart from this, these groups try and arm-twist ONGC officials into providing jobs even when there is no vacancy. 

 ?Both ONGC and OIL give preference to locals as far as employment is concerned and have set up schools and hospitals and undertaken the construction of roads and bridges in areas where they operate. But we do not have the resources to take up these activities on a state-wide scale,? a senior official said.

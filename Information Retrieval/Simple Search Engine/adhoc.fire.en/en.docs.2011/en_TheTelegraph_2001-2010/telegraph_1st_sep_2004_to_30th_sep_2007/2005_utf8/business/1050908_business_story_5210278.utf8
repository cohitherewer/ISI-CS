 Tata Steel holds Chiria edge

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Sept 7: Tata Steel has its nose ahead of Mittal Steel in the race to grab a slice of the lucrative Chiria iron ore mines in Jharkhand that the Arjun Munda government wants to farm out to a private player.

 The Chiria mines have the second largest high-grade deposits of iron ore in the world after the Urals.

 Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) controls a large chunk of the 2.5 billion tonnes of reserves in Chiria. Last January, the Munda government took back two of the 10 leases in the Chiria mines from SAIL subsidiary IISCO, which owns the mine leases. 

 The Munda government has been inviting steel makers to set up plants in the region and has dangled the carrot of Chiria mine leases.

 Mittal Steel, the worlds largest steel producer, proposes to set up a 10-million-tonne steel plant in Jharkhand, but it has been insisting on exporting a part of the iron ore deposits. The Jharkhand government is not keen to allow ore exports.

 Chief minister Arjun Munda said his government was not in favour of iron ore export. We do not want iron ore to go out of the state. Let the value addition be done here, he said.

 Sources say the Munda government is leaning towards Tata Steel in preference to Mittal Steel. The Tatas have proposed to invest Rs 40,000 crore to increase its steel-making capacity in the state.

 Sources in the state government said a memorandum of understanding (MoU) could be signed on Thursday for a 10-million-tonne steel plant, a new township modelled on Jamshedpur around it, and a 2,500 megawatt power plant. 

 Munda said discussions were still on with Mittal Steel on its proposed steel plant in the state. We are looking at the conditions put forward by it (Mittal Steel), he said.

 Export of iron ore has become a contentious issue after Korean steel major Poscos initial reluctance to invest in Orissa after it was denied the benefit of ore exports. Domestic steel majors lobbied against ore exports on the ground that this would undermine national interest.

 Mittal Steel has reportedly asked for 30 million tonnes of iron ore annually, half of which will go to feed its plants abroad.

 However, it still remains to be seen whether the mining concessions at Chiria, located in obscurity of the West Singhbhum district, will fall into Tata Steels lap.

 Chiria, which is endowed with very rich iron ore content of 62 to 65 per cent, has eight blocks leased to Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO).

 New Delhi, Jan. 3: The tsunami tragedy will not hurt the Indian economy, said the World Bank, which intends to stick to its earlier forecast of a 6.5 per cent GDP growth in 2004-05.

 ?We have not conducted any study to estimate the impact of tsunami on India, but it will not significantly change our outlook for fiscal 2004-05,? World Bank country director Michael Carter said on the sidelines of a seminar on ?Development and nationhood: An India perspective? organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 It will take some time for the World Bank to assess the economic impact of the tragedy, which has a ?terrible human cost?, he added.

 Carter said the loss should not be assessed only in terms of GDP growth as a lot of infrastructure will have to be rebuilt, including ports, hotels, clinics, roads and railways.

 The December 26 tsunami, which hit the coastal areas of South and Southeast Asia, has claimed around 1.4 lakh lives, with casualties in India standing at around 10,000. Over 5,500 people are still missing.

 According to data released by the Central Statistical Organisation, the Indian economy grew 7 per cent in the first half of this fiscal.

 Economic growth had slowed down to 6.6 per cent in the second quarter from 7.4 per cent in the first quarter because of a negative growth of 0.8 per cent in the farm sector.

 ?A significant rise of the services sector after 1990s clearly reflected gains that India made and is still making,? Carter said. He added that globalisation brought with itself efficiency, which was crucial for economic growth.

 The World Bank today also cautioned that while India has much to gain from globalisation, the country also needs to formulate means to cope with the costs of opening up of the economy, especially in the agriculture sector.

 ?On the trade front, India has a great deal to gain from globalisation. Of course, that does not come without costs because there are those adversely affected by it,? said Carter.

 Terming globalisation as an ?emotive issue?, he said some sub-sectors will have adverse effects following globalisation.

 For example in agriculture, if there was food liberalisation, there would be changes in the pattern of farming, with traditional crops having a more difficult time.

 According to Carter, globalisation also brings about pressures to improve efficiency, which was the fundamental basis for increasing productivity and income. He said the World Bank advocated a development process inclusive of all segments of society. ?We need more transparency in resource allocation through community participation,? he said.

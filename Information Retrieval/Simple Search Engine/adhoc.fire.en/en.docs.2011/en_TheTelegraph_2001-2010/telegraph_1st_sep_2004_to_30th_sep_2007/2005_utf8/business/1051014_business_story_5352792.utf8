 Capital account for Citi honcho

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 13: Citibank CEO Charles Prince today called on Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister P. Chidambaram, raising speculation about the global banks expansion plans in India.

 The government and the bank, however, refused to divulge details of the meetings. Government officials termed them as courtesy calls. Both meetings, with Singh and Chidambaram, lasted for about 20 minutes each. 

 The Citibank honcho is also scheduled to meet the RBI governor during his two-day stay in the country.

 Princes trip comes close on the heels of Chidambarams visit to the US, where he asked the global banks to invest in India and take a leading role in the countrys growth process.

 Top executives of other global banks, including Standard Chartered and Barclays, visited India as part of the European Union (EU) delegation. 

 India is poised for major banking reforms with two important bills ? the Banking Regulation (Amendment) Bill and the RBI (Amendment) Bill ? expected to be approved by Parliament in the coming session.

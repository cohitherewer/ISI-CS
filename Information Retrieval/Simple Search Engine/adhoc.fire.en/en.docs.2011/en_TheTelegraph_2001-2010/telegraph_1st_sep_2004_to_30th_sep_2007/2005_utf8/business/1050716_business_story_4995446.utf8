 Calcutta, July 15: Allahabad Bank has engaged Ernst amp; Young to draw up a plan for entering the insurance business and roping in foreign insurance companies as joint venture partners.

 The bank, along with its 100 per cent subsidiary AllBank Finance, will enter the insurance business. The due diligence report by the consultant will be ready within a month.

 The bank expects to rope in public sector banks in west and south as joint venture partners. The insurance outfit is expected to take a final shape in the next six months, Allahabad Bank chairman and managing director O.N. Singh said.

 Explaining the rationale behind roping in public sector banks as joint venture partners, Singh said the proposed insurance outfit could leverage the branch network of these banks to market its products.

 AllBank Finance is expected to put in Rs 60 crore in the insurance business. The minimum capital required to float an insurance outfit is Rs 100 crore. 

 AllBank Finance today received the licence for working as a category I merchant banker.

 The bank is yet to decide on the insurance segment ? life or non-life. 

 ?The life segment is exciting but the baggage is high, whereas non-life is less exciting but opportunities are more. The consultant will help us choose,? Singh said.

 Allahabad Bank is also eyeing a bank in the south. ?There are many small private sector banks in the south, which typically have an asset base of Rs 5,000-6,000 crore and they are not able to maintain a networth of Rs 300 crore. We are targeting these banks. The regulator, however, will have to take a decision on the takeover. Our talks with such private sector banks are at a preliminary stage,? the CMD added.

 The bank today announced its first-quarter results. Net profit rose to Rs 162.98 crore from Rs 137.65 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.

 The net NPA to net advances ratio has reduced to 0.99 per cent from 1.69 per cent in the year-ago period. The provision coverage ratio increased to 80.78 per cent at the end of the first quarter from 77.92 per cent on 31 March, 2005. 

 The bank is also finalising its human resource policy for which XLRI, Jamshedpur has been selected as HR consultant.

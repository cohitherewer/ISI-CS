 Jessop keen to shed BIFR tag

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 8: Jessop amp; Co wants to come out of the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR).

 The company, which was divested to Ruia Cotex in December 2003, has initiated steps to restructure its financials to clean up the balance sheet.

 It has already passed a resolution to reduce the face value of its shares from Rs 10 to Re 1. It has an authorised share capital of Rs 100 crore.

 This way, the company will be able to squeeze out Rs 90 crore, which then would be set off against accumulated loss.

 Jessop, which manufactures railway wagons, EMU coaches, road rollers and cranes, has sought the approval from the BIFR in this regard. Chairman Pawan K. Ruia hopes to wipe out the present accumulated loss of Rs 110 crore by March 2006. 

 ?Our first endeavour is to come out of the BIFR. Without this, we cannot grow fast,? Ruia said before of the companys 73rd annual general meeting on Saturday. 

 Jessop turned sick following years of losses before being referred to the BIFR, which deals with companies struggling with poor finances. Jessop posted a net profit of Rs 4.82 crore in 2004-05 compared with a net loss of Rs 6.38 crore in 2003-04. 

 New businesses

 Jessop has signed memoranda of understanding with international companies to foray into ship building, ship repairing, jetty construction and design, engineering and supply of processed packages required in oil and gas exploration business. 

 Meanwhile, Ruia said the group has put its textile business on the block as it now intended to focus more on the engineering sector.

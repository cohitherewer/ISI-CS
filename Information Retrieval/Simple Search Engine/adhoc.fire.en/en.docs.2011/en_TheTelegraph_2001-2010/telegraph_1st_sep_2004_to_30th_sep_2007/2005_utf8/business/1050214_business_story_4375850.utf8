 Resistance to Trai fee cut plan

 New Delhi, Feb. 13 (PTI): The department of telecommunications (DoT) is unlikely to accept Trai?s proposal on a reduction in the entry licence fee and revenue shares under the unified licensing policy because it feels the plan would create a non-level playing field between the existing and new players.

 The DoT feels that the proposed entry licence fee cut to Rs 107 crore for unified licence to offer all kinds of services, including telecom and broadcasting, might put existing operators in a difficult position as some of them have paid over Rs 2,000 crore as licence fee. Hence, litigation is likely to emerge out of this due to a demand for reimbursement.

 Sources added that the department had not made any proposal to the ministry of finance in these areas.

 The DoT?s stand is that with most of the major operators rolling out their networks throughout the country, it is unlikely that any new player would come at this stage to apply for fresh unified licences to take advantage of the reductions. 

 The service-specific licensing regime will be permitted for two years after unified licensing is implemented, Trai had said.

 Recently, Bharti took the DoT to telecom tribunal asking for refund of its entry fee of Rs 135 crore for five basic service licences, which it had surrendered to the department after migrating to unified access licensing.

 Trai had also proposed slashing the revenue share from 15 per cent to 6 per cent of the adjusted gross revenue (AGR).

 Resisting this proposal, the DoT said while levies needed to be cut to lower the mobile tariffs and reach the government?s target of 250 million phones by 2007, the current rates are already much lower. 

 The recent access deficit charge cut had also brought down the long-distance tariffs.

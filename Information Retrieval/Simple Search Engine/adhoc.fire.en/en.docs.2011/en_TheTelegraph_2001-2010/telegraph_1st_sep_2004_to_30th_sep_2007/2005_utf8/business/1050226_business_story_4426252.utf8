 FDI preferred to portfolio funds 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 25: The Economic Survey expresses concern over the growing volumes of hot money in the country represented by foreign institutional investors (FIIs) operating in the stock markets. It emphasises the need to take policy steps to woo long-term foreign direct investment (FDI) instead, which is more beneficial for the economy.

 The survey is in favour of the government ?revisiting? its FDI policy in order to attract more long-term foreign funds as short-term investments can make a sudden exit and destabilise the external sector, which would have a cascading impact on the economy. ?India?s capital account in recent years has gained far more strength from short-term FDI flows. This necessitates revisiting the FDI policy and identifying constraints impeding higher foreign fund inflows. Procedural simplifications like removal of anomalies from press note 18 are likely to encourage much greater FDI inflows,? the survey observes.

 Concerned over the mismatch between short-term portfolio investment as represented by FIIs and a long-term investment in terms of FDI, the survey said constraints impeding higher foreign fund inflows need to be identified.

 Short-term portfolio inflows into the stock markets in the first half of 2004-05 were $15.4 billion, much higher than $9.3 billion in the same period of the previous year. The outflows of this hot money in April-September 2004 stood at $14.8 billion compared with $5.8 billion in 2003.

 Net portfolio flows picked up from just $81 million in the first quarter to $430 million during July-September 2004. The figure was much lower than the net portfolio inflows of $3.5 billion in 2003-04. ?There are indications of a gain in momentum of portfolio inflows in the more recent months of the current financial year,? the survey said.

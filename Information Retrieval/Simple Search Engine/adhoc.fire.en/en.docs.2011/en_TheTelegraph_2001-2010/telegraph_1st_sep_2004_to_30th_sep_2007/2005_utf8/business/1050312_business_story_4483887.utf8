 Industry grows 8% in January

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 11: The better performance of the manufacturing sector offset the marked slowdown of the mining and electricity sectors to help the country post an 8 per cent industrial growth rate during January 2005, which is the same as in the year-ago period.

 The industrial growth rate for the April to January period, however, went up to 8.4 per cent compared with 6.7 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal, according to the quick estimates of the index of industrial production (IIP) released today.

 During January, the manufacturing sector posted a growth of 9.3 per cent compared with 8.2 per cent in the same month in 2004. The sector also registered improved performance with growth rate of 9.2 per cent during the first 10 months of this fiscal against 7.3 per cent in the corresponding previous period.

 However, the growth rate of the electricity sector during the reporting month plummeted to 2.3 per cent compared with 6.1 per cent in January 2004. But the cumulative growth during the April to January period went up to 6 per cent from 3.7 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.

 The mining sector grew by 4.6 per cent during the first 10 months against 4.7 per cent in the April to December period of 2003-04. However, growth in the sector fell to a mere 1.9 per cent in January compared with an impressive 8.7 per cent rate in the same month last year. Along with the quick estimates of the IIP for January 2005, the indices for December 2004 have undergone first revision and those for October 2004, the second and final revision.

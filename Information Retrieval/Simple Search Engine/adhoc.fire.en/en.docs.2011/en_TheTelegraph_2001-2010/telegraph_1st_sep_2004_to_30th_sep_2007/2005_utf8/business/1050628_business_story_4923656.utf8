 Reliance board meet today

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 27: The board of Reliance Industries will meet tomorrow to discuss the issues arising out of the settlement between the Ambani brothers. Details of the meetings agenda, however, could not be ascertained. We dont know what will be discussed. Details will be known only tomorrow, a company official said.

 The board may discuss the issue of RILs holding in Anil Ambanis group companies. Reports had earlier suggested that these holdings will be spun off into a special purpose vehicle or a separate holding company, whose control will be vested with Anil.

 The meeting comes days after the settlement to the over seven-month ownership dispute between Mukesh Ambani and his younger brother Anil. 

 According to the settlement, the elder brother will get control of RIL and IPCL, while Anil will take the reins at Reliance Energy (REL), Reliance Capital (RCL) and Reliance Infocomm. Anil now heads Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprises (ADAE). 

 Reliance Capital 

 Reliance Capital (RCL) has also convened an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders on July 19 to clear a Rs 3,000-crore preferential equity issue and hike the foreign institutional investment limit to 49 per cent.

 This follows the settlement between the Ambani brothers as part of which the financial services firm went to Anil. The younger scion has already announced an investment of Rs 2,000 crore in a preferential issue, which will be made at a price of Rs 228 per RCL share.

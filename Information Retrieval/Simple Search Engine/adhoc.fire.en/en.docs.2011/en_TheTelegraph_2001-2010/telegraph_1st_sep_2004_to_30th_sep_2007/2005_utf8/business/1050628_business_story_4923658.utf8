 Fiat ramps up stake in Indian arm

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Stepping in

 New Delhi, June 27: Fiat Auto SpA, the Italian parent of the beleaguered Fiat India Pvt Ltd, has pumped in Rs 200 crore to raise its stake in its Indian arm to 44.61 per cent from 19.44 per cent.

 The decision ends intense speculation about the fate of Fiat India, which was rumoured to be up for sale, especially after the Italian automaker was having problems of its own. 

 ?The investment reflects the parent company?s commitment to the Indian market,? the company said. 

 The grapevine had been abuzz with rumours that the Hindujas were in talks to buy out Fiat India and sources had said a high-profile meeting had taken place in London early this month where a deal was close to being clinched. 

 The Hindujas had also recently visited Fiat Indias Kurla plant. 

 Hinduja group sources had earlier said they were ?exploring opportunities to enhance the relationship with Fiat, and passenger cars is one of the options?. 

 The Hindujas have a five-year joint venture with Fiat SpA through Iveco, where the Fiat group holds a 51 per cent stake, while Hinduja-owned Ashok Leyland holds the remaining equity. 

 Industry sources said Fiat India had earlier approached utility vehicle maker Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) through an investment banker. However, the overture did not make headway as M amp;M already had an agreement with French car maker Renault to manufacture passenger cars in India. 

 Since 1998, Fiat SpA has made investments worth Rs 2,200 crore in India to build capacity and enhance infrastructure facilities. 

 The infusion of funds represents free cash flow needed for future investments, to repay debt and restructure its dealer network, thereby sustaining its current operations. 

 Paolo Castagna, newly-appointed managing director of Fiat India, said, ?Our objective is to ensure that we achieve the required growth rates in the country by streamlining our operations and targeting our brand strategy at the premium end.?

 ?Having identified our focus areas, we aim to use the new strength of our balancesheet to improve our overall dealer network, enhance our customer service initiatives according to Fiat?s international standards and increase internal cash flows for vital investments,? Castagna said. 

 Fiat Adventure Sport is the latest offering from the Italian car giant targeted at the new generation of customers. 

 Fiat India is completely managed by Fiat Auto SpA of Italy. Giovanni Agnelli founded Fiat SpA in 1899. In India, the company was established in 1905 with the appointment of the Bombay Motor Cars Agency as its sales agent. 

 Later, Fiat Automobiles had signed a licence and servicing contract with Premier Automobiles Ltd and went on to make Fiat Padmini cars.

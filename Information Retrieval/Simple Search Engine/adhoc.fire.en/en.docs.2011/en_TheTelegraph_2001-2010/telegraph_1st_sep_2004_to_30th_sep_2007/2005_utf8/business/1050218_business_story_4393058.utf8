 Move to do away with export cess

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 17: The commerce ministry has proposed to withdraw export cess to facilitate trade and industry, Union commerce secretary S. N. Menon said here on Thursday.

 ?We feel that the cess should go. We have initiated discussion on the issue internally,? Menon said. However, no timeframe has been set for the withdrawal, he added.

 He pointed out that the revenue implication for the government because of this withdrawal would not be too high. However, not all export cess is within the jurisdiction of the commerce ministry.

 Menon said an inter-ministerial discussion had to be initiated on the issue. The finance and law ministries would have to be involved in the process. ?There are a lot of legal issues involved,? he said.

 Export cess is applicable on many agricultural commodities like coffee, tobacco and black pepper.

 The Centre is expecting exports of $75 billion this year, up from $63.5 billion last fiscal. The government has set a target of $150 billion by 2009. During the first ten months of 2004-05, exports have grown by 25.55 per cent. During January, exports jumped by 33 per cent.

 Singapore pact

 India is on the verge of signing a comprehensive economic co-operation agreement with Singapore. Menon said the talks had reached an advanced stage. ?There is no timeframe. However, we hope the agreement could be signed by late April,? he said. Such agreements have a wider scope than Free Trade Agreements. The government is also working on a host of bilateral trade agreements, namely the Indo-Asean Framework Agreement, Indo-Thailand Free Trade Agreement and BIMSTEC Free Trade Agreement. India is also negotiating different trade agreements with the Gulf countries, Mercosur and South African Customs Union.

 Easy trade

 The government is considering setting up a Land Port Management Authority to facilitate trade with neighbours. Menon said the northeastern region will play a major role in developing close business relations with Asean countries.

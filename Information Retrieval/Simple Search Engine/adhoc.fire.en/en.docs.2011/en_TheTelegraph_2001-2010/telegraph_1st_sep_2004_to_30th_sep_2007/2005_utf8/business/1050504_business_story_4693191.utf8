 Call ends for promo service

 Value for money

 New Delhi, May 3: Mobile phone users can breathe easy: operators will not push down your throat a chargeable value-added service without your explicit consent.

 Further, a value-added service, which was earlier being provided free of charge, shall not be made chargeable without the explicit consent of the customer.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today directed all cellular mobile service providers and Unified Access Service Licensees (UASL) to publish the pulse rate and tariff for premium rate services.

 A Trai release said the regulator has observed that in the last few months, a number of operators and also some independent agencies were increasingly providing value-added services like quiz, ringtones and tele-voting through SMS. 

 In most of these cases, the charges for these services are more than the normal published tariffs. 

 Trai said while customers are informed about these value-added premium rate services through SMS, advertisements in newspaper and other media, the cost implication has not been specified. This practice of service providers works against the interest of consumers. 

 There are also instances where an operator offers a new value-added service free for a certain trial period. 

 Subsequently, after the expiry of the trial period, the consumer is informed, usually by SMS, that if he does not want the service, he should ?unsubscribe? by sending an SMS to the service provider.

 The authority has observed that in such cases, the burden of informing the service provider that he does not want the service is placed with the customer. 

 ?This amounts to offering value-added service without the explicit consent of the customer. This has to be rectified,? the telecom regulator said.

 Calcutta, Sept. 16: The Plantation Labour Act, 1951 may be amended soon to address the issue of social cost of the tea industry. 

 The Union labour ministry is currently in talks with its commerce counterpart ? under whose purview the tea industry comes ? to work out a formula for the social cost.

 Social cost is becoming a burden on the industry at a time when price realisation is low and the cost of production is going up. 

 The industry had made several representations to the government to address the issue. 

 In north India, which produces the bulk of tea, the social cost is Rs 7.17 per kg (including foodgrain subsidy). The total annual expenditure comes to Rs 459.97 crore in north India.

 The Union labour ministry is considering amending the plantation labour Act. They are consulting our ministry also. The amendments will be made after discussing with other stakeholders of the tea industry, S.N. Menon, the Union commerce secretary, said at the annual general meeting of the Indian Tea Association.

 The government had earlier set up an inter-ministerial committee (IMC) on the act. 

 The IMC had recommended that the Centre and state governments should agree to bear 50 per cent of the social cost under the act, while the industry should bear the remaining 50 per cent of this cost.

 The 50 per cent share should be shouldered by the Centre and the state/local self-government in the ratio of 40:10, it said. 

 A lower burden for the states is recommended in view of a difficult fiscal situation and because the plantation industry is primarily under the purview of the Centre. 

 Regarding the proposed special-purpose tea fund to boost replantation and rejuvenation, Menon said the scheme is being currently prepared by the Indian Banks Association in consultation with the Nabard.

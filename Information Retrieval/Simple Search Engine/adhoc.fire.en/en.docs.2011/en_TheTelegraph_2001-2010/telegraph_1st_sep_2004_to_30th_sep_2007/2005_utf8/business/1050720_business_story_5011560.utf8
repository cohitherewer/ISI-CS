 Raffles out of reach

 SATISH JOHN

 Mumbai, July 19: The Tatas were among the contenders for Singapores iconic Raffles Hotel, but lost out to Colony Capital.

 We had put in our bid for Raffles, but we lost. The fact is that we have lost but life moves on, said sources close to the group. The deal would have been a feather in the cap but the size of the deal, at Rs 4450 crore, would have too much for the Taj group of hotels to afford. 

 Hotel industry watchers say a successful bid would have been worth the effort as it would have catapulted the chain into the global league of Four Seasons and Hilton. 

 A month ago, Indian Hotels had bought out the management rights for The Pierre, a premium luxury hotel in New York for $50 million (Rs 220 crore). The move would help it reposition itself as a luxury chain in the US.

 Rate stance unchanged

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 26: The Reserve Bank (RBI) today left key interest rates untouched in its first-quarter review of the annual monetary policy to maintain the momentum in the economy at a time when global uncertainties are on the rise.

 While the bank rate was unchanged at 6 per cent, the reverse repo remained at 5 per cent and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) too was left at the same level.

 The RBIs move not to change the reverse repo rate, an instrument through which it sucks out excess liquidity from the system, came as a surprise to many who had expected a hike of 25 basis points.

 In April, the central bank had increased the rate to 5 per cent from 4.75 per cent in an attempt to moderate inflationary expectations. Subsequently, housing finance companies had hiked interest rates by half a percentage point.

 The RBI policy statement is in line with what the government thinks. At the moment, I dont think there is a case for any sharp adjustments in interest rates, Finance minister P. Chidambaram said in New Delhi.

 Its current assessment of the macroeconomic outlook and the overall stance remained broadly unchanged from the annual policy statement made in April 2005.

 It kept the economic growth rate and inflation estimates unchanged at around 7 per cent and 5-5.5 per cent respectively.

 There are several global uncertainties but there are domestic factors that indicate a confidently growing economy in a stable environment, RBI said.

 While the global factors are becoming increasingly significant for India, the domestic factors still dominate and point to favouring stability to maintain the growth momentum.

 The overall industrial growth has maintained a healthy uptrend, though the delayed monsoon has imparted some uncertainties to the likely level of agricultural production. The non-food credit growth has been buoyant and broadbased.

 On overall inflation trends, the central bank said the current level of inflation remains moderate, both at the wholesale and retail levels. The inflationary outcome turned out consistent with the anticipation at the beginning of the year and underlying inflation remains contained. However, the pass-through of oil prices is not yet complete, the apex bank added. 

 The RBI said the revaluation of the yuan will have a marginal positive impact on Indias trade account. 

 Industry honchos also welcomed the credit policy review. The RBIs assessment is positive and the stance towards interest rates is welcome, DSP Merrill Lynch joint managing director Amit Chandra said. Kotak Mahindra AMCs CEO Sandesh Kirkire was also upbeat about the review.

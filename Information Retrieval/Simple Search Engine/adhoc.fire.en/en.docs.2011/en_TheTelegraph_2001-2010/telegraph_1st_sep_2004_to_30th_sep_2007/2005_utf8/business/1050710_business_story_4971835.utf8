The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Bengal keeps pace 

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, July 9: Its raining goodies for the sales tax department of the Bengal government.

 During the first quarter after the introduction of value-added tax (VAT) regime, the collection has gone up by 20 per cent.

 Moreover, the fear of sky-rocketing commodity prices was also unfounded. In fact, there has been a reduction in prices of select items.

 C. M. Bachhawat, commissioner of commercial taxes in Bengal, said a significant reduction in prices has taken place since April in cooking gas, cosmetics, detergents, cement, cooked food and medicine.

 I cannot claim that prices have come down because of lower rates in the VAT regime. It could even be the market forces, Bachhawat told The Telegraph.

 However, he declined to give details about the collection figures. Sources said the revenue collection was robust in the first three months. They also pointed out that traders resistance has gone down significantly. 

 Traders are willingly coming forward for registration, they added.

 Stage set for pipeline deal

 Forward march

 New Delhi, Aug. 4: India today softened its stand on the proposed Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline by signalling its readiness for the tripartite agreement. 

 At the end of the two-day Indo-Iran joint working group meeting, senior officials said the petroleum ministry would seek cabinet approval for joining the consortium, once the three countries decide on the project framework by the end of this year. 

 Earlier, India had said it would not be a part of the project as the pipeline would run through Pakistan. Instead, it would sign a bilateral agreement with Iran for taking delivery of the gas at the Indian border. 

 ?We will have no control over the price of the gas, if we merely sit on the fence and just be a buyer. We need to be involved in the project. Besides, we can ensure security of the pipeline in a much better way once we are part of the consortium,? a senior official said.

 Iranian deputy oil minister M.H. Nejad Hosseinian admitted that terrorist attacks pose a great threat to the pipeline. ?Security is an important issue and we will address it in the framework agreement.?

 According to a joint statement released after the meeting, ?Once there is an agreement on the project structure, the trilateral framework agreement would be finalised by the end of this year.?

 ?On the basis of the recommendations of the financial consultants, there would be a preliminary understanding on the preferred project structure by early November. In this context, subject to mutual convenience, the Iranian minister of petroleum would visit India at this time,? the statement added.

 By the month-end or early September, India and Pakistan will appoint separate financial consultants to suggest the project structure and address the technical, commercial and legal aspects to make it safe and secure, said Talmiz Ahmad, additional secretary (international co-operation), ministry of petroleum and natural gas.

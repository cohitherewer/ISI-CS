 New Delhi, June 20: The soaring global crude prices have pushed up Oil and Natural Gas Corporations net profit for 2004-05. The oil majors bottomline grew 50 per cent to Rs 12,983 crore compared with Rs 8,664 in 2003-04. 

 Chairman Subir Raha said the profit would have been higher but for the LPG and kerosene subsidy burden of Rs 4,104 crore, which the company had to pay. 

 Also, he said while ONGC was getting $1.19 per million British thermal units (Btu) for its natural gas, private joint venture partners in the ONGC-discovered Panna-Mukta and Tapti gas fields were being allowed to rake in more than $4 per million Btu. Although natural gas accounted for nearly half of ONGCs output, it contributed only 11.5 per cent to the total earnings, he said. The distorted pricing had impacted the corporation by Rs 2,553 crore. 

 The oil behemoth has announced a 400 per cent dividend, which works out to Rs 5,704 crore, for last fiscal. Its earnings per share have gone up to Rs 91.05 from Rs 60.76 per share in 2003-04.

 Raha said ONGC is planning to diversify the downstream refining business. It is also finalising a marketing strategy for petroleum products and petrochemicals.

 ONGC has drawn up a Rs-3,000 crore plan to increase the capacity of Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) from 9 million tonnes to 15 million tonnes. The detailed feasibility report for the project is expected to be submitted in a months time, he said.

 MRPL will set up a new 15 million-tonne unit. The companys long-term plan is to double the capacity to 30 million tonnes, he added. However, the government has to approve the project.

 Raha said ONGC has set aside Rs 10,861 crore towards capital expenditure for its core business of oil exploration and production this year.

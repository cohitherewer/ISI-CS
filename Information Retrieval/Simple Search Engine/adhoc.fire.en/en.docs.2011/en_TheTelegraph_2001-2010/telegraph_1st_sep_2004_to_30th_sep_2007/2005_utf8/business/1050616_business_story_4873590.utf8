 New Delhi, June 15: After Aviva, AMP Sanmar has another suitor. Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance is eyeing a stake in AMP Sanmar Life Insurance.

 Recently, AMP, the Australian insurance major, had announced plans to pull out of its Indian life insurance venture with the Sanmar group. The Indian partner is also keen to exit from the insurance business.

 This is happening for the first time. One would like to take a look at what is on offer. We are an interested observer, said Gaurang Shah, MD of Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual Life Insurance.

 AMP Sanmar has been exploring options for restructuring its ownership, including outright sale to an existing or a new player or bringing in a new partner. The company has appointed an investment banker for this purpose. 

 Shah, however, said it would make sense for new entrants rather than existing players to buy out the stake.

 Meanwhile, Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual is planning to raise the capital base by infusing Rs 100 crore over the next three years. Of this, Rs 40 crore will be invested this fiscal. Following this, the companys paid-up capital will go up to Rs 300 crore from Rs 260 crore at present. 

 The private insurer is looking at breaking even by 2007-08. We will need Rs 100 crore to break even by 2007-08. This capital will not be needed to support business but to fund initial losses, Shah said.

 It would also expand the staff strength. Kotak Mahindra Old Mutual will employ 12,000 agents, up from 7000, and increase sales managers to 850 from 450.

 The private insurer, which registered a 198 per cent growth in first year premium income at Rs 375 crore in 2004-05, is targeting Rs 700 crore premium income this year.

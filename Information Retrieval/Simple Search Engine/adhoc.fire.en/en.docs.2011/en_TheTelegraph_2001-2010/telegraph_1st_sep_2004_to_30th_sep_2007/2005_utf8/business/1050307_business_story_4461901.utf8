 Profiling the tax breaks

 Budget has doled out tax sops to all. Chandralekha Tulal takes a look at how things stack up for four individuals 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram?s recent budget aims at providing tax breaks to all and seeks to turn India into a nation of investors.

 Let us take a look at how the changed tax structure may benefit various classes of people and the flexibility provided by the removal of limit-based exemptions.

 Rahul Saxena, aged 24 years, works at a call centre; he has no dependents and earns Rs 1.5 lakh a year.

 Let us assume that he stumps up Rs 3,000 a year on mediclaim insurance premium and he repays an education loan annually amounting to Rs 23,000.

 Taking into account the standard deduction of Rs 30,000, under the old tax structure, his taxable income was Rs 94,000, which being below Rs 1 lakh, was exempted from tax. However, under the new structure, after providing for the above-mentioned deductions, other than the standard deduction, Rahul will have to make an investment of Rs 24,000 under section 80C to get a nil tax liability; otherwise he will have to pay a tax of Rs 2,400.

 As there are no specific investment limits now, Rahul can make necessary allocations across instruments according to his risk profile. At his age, he can take higher investment risk and thereby can invest around 70 per cent of his total investment in equity instruments. Thus, he can invest around Rs 16,000 in a combination of ELSS, pension funds and unit-linked insurance schemes and the rest in PPF, NSC and other fixed income instruments available under the section. 

 Priya Sinha, aged 30 years, works at a bank; she is unmarried, has parents who are aged 55 and 60 years, and she earns Rs 3 lakh a year.

 Let us assume that she spends Rs 10,000 a year on a mediclaim insurance policy for herself and her parents and another Rs 10,000 in a pension fund, which has now been brought within the ambit of Section 80C. 

 Under the old tax structure, her taxable income was Rs 2,50,000, the tax on which is Rs 49,000. After considering the tax rebate of Rs 5,000 under section 88C for women and the rebate of 15 per cent on investment of Rs 1 lakh, her actual liability will come down to Rs 29,000. 

 However, under the new structure, after providing for medical insurance and making use of the saving deduction limit of Rs 1 lakh under section 80C, Priya will have to pay a tax of Rs 10,500. Since Priya has partial responsibility of her parents, her risk appetite will be lower than that of Rahul. However, at her age, a 50:50 debt and equity should be ideal. Thus, she can invest around Rs 50,000 in a combination of ELSS, pension funds and unit-linked insurance schemes and the rest in PPF, NSC and other fixed income instruments available under the section. 

 Rajeev Mazumdar, aged 47 years, is self-employed, married with two children aged 16 and 11 years, and earns Rs 9 lakh a year. 

 Let us assume he pays Rs 10,000 a year as medical insurance premium for himself and his family. He used to invest Rs 10,000 in a pension fund. He is also repaying a home loan of Rs 8 lakh. Thus, his taxable income is Rs 8,80,000, since he is not eligible for standard deduction. Under the old structure, his tax liability was Rs 2,61,800. 

 However, under the new structure, after providing for medical insurance and making use of the saving deduction limit of Rs 1 lakh under section 80C, Rajeev will have to pay a tax of Rs 2,05,700. He also stands to gain since the earlier levy of 10 per cent surcharge on income above Rs 8.5 lakh has now been increased to Rs 10 lakh. 

 Since Rajeev is repaying a home loan and has two children, both school-going, before making investments, he can claim for the expenses towards repayment of the loan and for the tuition fees paid for children?s education. 

 Thereafter, he can make his investments and allocate around 35 per cent to the equity instruments available and the remaining in fixed income instruments. He can also take insurance policies for his children, as premiums paid on such policies are also eligible under the limit. 

 Vishwanath Mukherjee, aged 67 years, retired earns Rs 5 lakh a year from various sources, including pension. Let us assume that he spends Rs 15,000 a year on medical insurance premium for himself and his spouse. Taking into account the standard deduction, under the old tax structure, his taxable income was Rs 4,55,000, the tax on which is Rs 1,10,500. After considering the tax rebate of Rs 20,000 under section 88B for senior citizens and rebate of 15 per cent on investment of Rs 1 lakh, the liability was Rs 75,500.

 However, under the new structure, after providing for medical insurance and making use of the saving limit of Rs 1 lakh under section 80C, Mukherjee will have to pay a tax of Rs 60,500.

 At his age, it is advisable for him to invest a marginal 5 to 10 per cent in equity with the remaining in fixed income instruments. And now since it is no more important to keep money locked in PPF, he can use it in other applicable schemes.

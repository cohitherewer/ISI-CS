 Petrol fires plastic hope

 Discount offer

 Mumbai, May 25: Standard Chartered Bank will return 5 per cent of the total fuel bill in any petrol pump in the country if the payment is made through its credit card. The bank has unveiled this offer to promote use of plastic money in petrol pumps.

 A consumer research study commissioned by the bank has revealed that customers are hesitant to use their credit cards in petrol pumps, while they are comfortable using them elsewhere, said Viraj Tyagi, head of credit cards at StanChart.

 The offer comes at a time when vehicle owners are fretting over a possible price hike in petroleum products. 

 StanChart ? rated among the top three credit-card companies ? is offering the highest discount in the industry as the maximum cash-back offer at present is around 2.5 per cent. The bank will adjust the offer amount in the monthly credit-card bill. 

 A customer who spends Rs 4,500 monthly on petrol could get a credit of around Rs 200 per month and the offer, which is valid till July, could fetch the user over Rs 600.

 Credit-card companies have exclusive tie-ups with petroleum firms by offering them discounts such as a surcharge waiver. The discount so far available to credit card users was a maximum of 2.5 per cent, Tyagi said.

 StanChart also has an exclusive marketing tie-up with BPCL. But the latest promotional offer is applicable to other petroleum firms as well.

 This is just an attempt to motivate people to use the card in petrol pumps, Tyagi said. The bank will not set any minimum amount to avail of the cash-back offer, he added.

 According to estimates, there are over 12 million credit-card holders in the country who swipe Rs 25,000 crore per annum.

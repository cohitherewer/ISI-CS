 Hyderabad airport to take off in three years

 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Aug. 24: The Hyderabad International Airport will begin commercial operations from the first quarter of 2008.

 The project, to be implemented by a consortium headed by the Bangalore-based GMR group, will cost Rs 1760 crore. It will come up at Shamshabad, 25 km from Hyderabad.

 Announcing the financial closure of the Hyderabad International Airport, its managing director G. Kiran Kumar said the total project outlay included an additional contingency of Rs 97 crore as prescribed for all infrastructure projects.

 We want to bring back home the air hub from Dubai and Singapore to capture the growing international traffic, he added.

 The project, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 1.2:1, has GMR Infrastructure Ltd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhard, the Airports Authority of India and the Andhra Pradesh government as equity partners.

 GMR holds a 63 per cent stake, while Malaysia Airports has picked up 11 per cent.

 The Airports Authority of India and the Andhra Pradesh government have a 13 per cent stake each in the project.

 He said the project comprised Rs 378 crore as equity, Rs 960 crore as debt, Rs 315 crore interest-free loan from the Andhra Pradesh government and a grant of Rs 107 crore from the state.

 IDBI and IDFC, besides six other domestic banks, have offered the debt component, he said. 

 The company has already signed a contract with L amp;T to install the airside and landside works. China State Engineering (Hong Kong) Ltd will set up the passenger terminal building, he said.

 Kiran Kumar said the airport would be designed to absorb the growing passenger and cargo traffic. Initially, the airport will provide facilities for seven million passengers but can expand up to 40 million in the final count, he said.

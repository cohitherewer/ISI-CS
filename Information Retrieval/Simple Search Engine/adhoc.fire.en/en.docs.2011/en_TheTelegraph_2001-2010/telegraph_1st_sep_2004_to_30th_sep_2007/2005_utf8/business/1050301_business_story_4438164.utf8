The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

Serious about social issues

Theme Music / Dilip B. Desai

The theme of the budget, at least on face value, is 

reflected in the last portion of the finance minister?s speech, where he quotes 

from the work of one of India?s proudest sons, Amartya Sen. He has assured the 

nation on behalf of the UPA government that the above dimension has been considered 

in the budget and genuine attempts have been made to give effect to it.

Thus, the changes made in the levy of direct and indirect 

taxes are evaluated keeping this deliberation in mind. 

While the general reduction in the peak rate of customs 

duty would be welcome for the consuming industry in the domestic sector, it also 

opens up the debate as to whether it is the correct move at this nascent stage 

of higher industrial growth. The domestic industry is not accustomed or geared 

up to face serious competition both in the form of quality and price. It is true 

that the tariff protective shield around Indian industry is not the answer, at 

the same time, throwing the entire Indian domestic industry to the white wolves 

could become counter productive at least in the short run. While the UPA government 

appears to be serious about social issues, the pressure of forced unemployment 

due to closure of domestic industry due to rampant globalisation may lead to public 

outcry.

In spite of the aforesaid, the government?s attempts 

to encourage the IT industry, textile sector, tea and food processing etc. by 

virtual absence of tax incidence is definitely laudable. However, the changes 

made in the duty rates per se may not bring about the desired changes either in 

the industrial growth or per capita income. One of the reasons given by the finance 

minister for reducing the customs duty rates on capital goods shall provide encouragement 

for investments by domestic entrepreneurs and inflow of higher FDI. However, these 

desired results can be achieved only if the per capita income increases, resulting 

in higher consumption of domestic goods or the China phenomenon, of being able 

to export and sell everything in developing or under-developed countries, sets 

in quickly in India. The chances of such a thing happening in India in the near 

future appears to be quite dull. 

Nevertheless, with international pressure of neutral 

tariff effect and domestic political pressure from some of the UPA partners, Chidambaram 

was compelled to introduce this lukewarm Budget.

On the direct tax front, effective lower rate of taxation 

and a reinstallation of MAT credit would be definitely welcomed by the industry. 

The finance minister has also granted a long pending wish of the industry to consider 

transactions in derivatives as non speculative. However, the amendment has been 

introduced with effect from Financial year 2005-06, transactions in derivatives 

till March 2005 may be considered as speculative. With the decrease in the tax 

rates the budget has also decreased the rates of depreciation under the Income 

Tax Act on various assets decreasing the impact of an effective tax planning tool 

in the hands of the industry. Imposition of banking cash transaction tax in the 

words of the finance minister is a special scheme to unearth black money and assets. 

The imposition of tax and reporting of the same by the bank to the tax department 

would definitely deter the assessee from dealing in black money. Imposition of 

fringe benefit tax shall result in additional compliance to be followed by the 

employers by way of filing of returns, assessment procedurals etc. in addition 

to various other already burdened legislative compliances.

 The price of loyalty

 Chandralekha Tulal finds out how customers can derive maximum benefit from privilege membership cards

 How loyal are you? Times change. Attitudes shift. Customers? needs fluctuate constantly. In such a scenario, it is obvious that customer loyalty is a virtue that every retailer across the world would strive for. And why not? According to the Harvard Business Review, most US companies lose half their customers every five years. Another study by the Boston Consulting Group says that it costs approximately five times more to acquire a new customer than to retain the existing ones. 

 If we take a look around, what 

 will be clear is that we can differentiate between loyalty 

 that is ?bought? versus loyalty that is ?earned?. The choice 

 would definitely be between quantitative (freebies, discounts 

 and others) and qualitative (listening intently to the customer?s 

 needs and going all out to meet them). 

 Since buying is a lot easier and faster than earning in today?s competitive world, retailers are falling over each other in developing new and innovative packages to grab your attention and ensure it doesn?t drift towards the competitor. 

 In India, which woke up late to 

 the retail revolution, players have latched on to the tried 

 and tested techniques in customer retention that have been 

 honed in the ?early-riser countries?. 

 Reward points through privilege membership is a widely used method that prevails in each and every sector. So, the next time your retailer offers a privilege membership, do take a close look at it as it may mean a return of around 2 per cent on your transaction amount, depending on the frequency and quantum of your purchases. This does not take into account the one-time enrolment fee. 

 For example, Westside waives the 

 initial fee of Rs 150 on its Clubwest Classic card, provided 

 you make a one-time purchase worth Rs 2,000. A one-time 

 purchase of Rs 5,000 entitles you to become a Clubwest Gold 

 card. 

 On the other hand, Shoppers? Stop charges an enrolment fee of Rs 150 for its First Citizen Classic Moments card. Later, one can upgrade to the Silver Edge and Golden Glow card by making purchases worth Rs 10,000 and Rs 40,000 during the membership period. 

 Being a First Citizen Golden Glow member, you earn one reward point for every Rs 34 worth of purchases, with one point being equal to Re 1. Thus, if you make purchases worth Rs 40,000, you earn 1,176 points and can redeem it for anything worth Rs 1,176. This means a return of 2.94 per cent. 

 Most retailers use some variant 

 of this basic technique to win the loyalty of their notoriously 

 fickle customers. All these calculations look quite sound 

 and healthy. But are customers really aware about how to 

 use these loyalty schemes to their advantage? If you ask 

 around, you will find that most customers have insufficient 

 information about the retention programmes and find the 

 process full of hassles. 

 Savvy customers pick up the membership 

 cards, maintain a close record of redemption points and 

 claim benefits at regular intervals. But a vast majority 

 just quail at the very idea of filling out a form and sharing 

 information about themselves.

 ?They asked me to become a member by paying some amount but the information was so garbled that I could not make a head or tail of it. I refused,? says Amarjeet Mitra. 

 ?I cannot keep track of the accumulated points and the ways to redeem them. Also, I forget to present my card on every visit,? says Preeti Sharma. By contrast, there are savvy buyers who find out points with retailers? help.

 Says Rachel D?Souza, ?Mentally, I keep track of my purchases and whenever I feel that I might have accumulated sufficient points, I check and immediately redeem them on my next purchases.?

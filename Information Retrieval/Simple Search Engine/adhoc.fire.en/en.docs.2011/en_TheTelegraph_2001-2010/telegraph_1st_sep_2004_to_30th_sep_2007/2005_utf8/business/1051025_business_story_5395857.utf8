 Scare on markets

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 24: Stocks went into a tailspin today on worries that the Reserve Bank would be forced to raise interest rates to help the government fight inflation.

 On Dalal Street, where BSE sensex plunged 148.15 points to settle at its lowest close since September 2, fears ran high that a key short-term rate ? the reverse repo ? will go up 0.25 per cent to 0.5 per cent on Tuesday. 

 The National Stock Exchanges nifty fell 48.90 points to 2,394.85.

 Some analysts said the market had come a full circle between October 5, when the sensex leap to a peak of 8,822 points, and October 20, when it hurtled down to 7,838.

 The retreat by foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who have been net sellers by Rs 1462 crore this month, have also gone a long way in turning the market mood sombre.

 Bank shares were among the days worst performers, felled by rising jitters on the eve of the Reserve Banks credit policy. BSEs bank index lost 83.96 at 4,465.

 SBI, HDFC Bank, HDFC, ICICI Bank, Infosys, TCS, Wipro, Reliance, Ranbaxy, Dr Reddys, Tata Steel, Larsen amp; Toubro, Bhel and Wipro took the hardest knocks.

 However, the duo of Bajaj and Maruti helped put a lid on the losses. They lifted the auto index, which gained 15.64 points to end at 3,545.45, in the selling spree.

 The volume of business on BSE was Rs 2437.47 crore compared with Rs 3113.86 on Friday. Reliance clocked the highest turnover of Rs 183.75 crore, followed by Reliance Capital (Rs 175.88 crore) and SBI (Rs 145.20 crore).

 New Delhi, Aug. 19: The government feels interest rates will remain stable in the near and medium terms. Finance minister P. Chidambaram indicated as much today, saying he expected little change in the cost of money despite the pressure on inflation from high oil prices.

 The government, he said, would still keep a vigil on essential commodities whose cost to the consumer tends to be heavily influenced by a spike in oil prices. Dont expect any change in interest rate in medium term. Inflation is down because the supply side is good and the Reserve Bank is carrying out an adroit management of money supply, Chidambaram said. 

 Chances of a rise in rates have receded with low inflation, which plumbed a two-and-half-year low at 3.35 per cent for the week ended August 6 in fresh data put out today.

 The government, which wants a low rates regime to boost industrial revival and loan-fuelled housing, is happy with a situation where enough cash can be had for little. The minister, however, said there was no reason to be complacent when the crude spike is not over. The government needed to be careful and vigilant. We are watching sugar, wheat, rice, steel and cement.

 The need to keep inflation under control has had a casualty ? sugar exports to Pakistan. Traders hoping for big gains will have to wait for supply concerns to ease at home before they can sell the commodity to the neighbour.

 Finance ministry officials said the government felt it needed to be on guard as significant inflationary pressures could build up with a rise in oil prices over 10 days.

 Chidambaram admitted the upward spiral in global oil prices, having flared up above $66 a barrel, would have an adverse impact. 

 The government has refused to charge more for the oil, in line with the global jump, but it cannot shield them too long if it wants to keep oil firms balance-sheets from weakening further.

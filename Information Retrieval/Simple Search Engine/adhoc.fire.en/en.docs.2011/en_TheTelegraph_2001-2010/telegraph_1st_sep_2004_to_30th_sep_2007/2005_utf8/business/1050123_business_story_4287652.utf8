 Bosses get the stick

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 22: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today lashed out at the domestic Indian industry for resisting the corporate governance code which the government is trying to bring in.

 ?I am dismayed by the obstructionist attitude to corporate governance displayed ... there is resistance even to the norm of having 50 per cent independent directors and age limits for directors,? Chidambaram said at the CEOs summit.

 The finance minister?s public statement comes a few days after chief executives of leading firms managed to successfully lobby the company affairs minister P.C. Gupta, an RJD nominee in the cabinet, into agreeing to dilute the draft norm. Analysts saw it as a formal declaration that the norm would not be diluted by the Congress-led government.

 Over the last two years, successive governments at the Centre had been trying to work out a stronger corporate governance code after a public outcry over a number of corporate scams ? both domestic and global ? came to light.

 A top finance ministry official added that the government may actually announce more corporate governance initiatives soon. ?We cannot have a situation where the PSUs follow stringent corporate ethics and the private sector chooses to ignore them,? he said.

 Chidambaram also attacked the Indian Inc. by stating that ?very few have set up audit committees, nomination committees and remuneration committees.? He pointed out that this was against the basic norms of transparent corporate governance and warned that CEOs of publicly held companies who award themselves huge compensation packages without adequately delivering profits to stakeholders, ?would eventually face a reaction and be punished if they fail to perform.?

 For the public sector chief executives, who have long been hankering for fatter pay checks, he said there could be a fatter two-part compensation package for tem. One part will be the basic pay and the other will be linked to performance. ?But then, you cannot ask for tribunals and be ready for punishment on the lines of CEOs of private companies,? the finance minster said.

 Chidambaram said the definition of a stakeholder has gone beyond the traditional boundaries and now includes even consumers and those engaged in the supply chain and asked CEOs to be far more responsive to them.

 He said if CEOs were asked ?what is the distance they have travelled in the corporate governance scale of 1-10, not many of them will reply that they have crossed even three.?

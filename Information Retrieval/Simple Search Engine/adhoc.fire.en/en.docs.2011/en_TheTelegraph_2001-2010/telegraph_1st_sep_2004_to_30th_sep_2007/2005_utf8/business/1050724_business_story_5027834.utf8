 Calcutta, July 23: Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd (RINL), which owns the Vishakhapatnam Steel Plant, is considering a joint venture with the state-run National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) for setting up a pellet or sponge iron plant in Jharkhand.

 The public sector steel maker wanted to acquire some iron ore mines in the mineral-rich state, but the Jharkhand government is not inclined to let iron ore go out of the state without any value addition. So the company is contemplating pellet or sponge iron making facility in the state. Iron ore rich states are inclined to give mining lease to only those companies that set up plants there. 

 RINL sources iron ore from NMDC, but it wants to scale up the mineral supply to feed its capacity expansion to 7 million tonne (mt) by 2007 from 3.5 mt at present.

 NMDC has identified some mines for RINL in Jharkhand and has also filed applications for their mining lease.

 ?We are looking at the most cost effective measure to secure ore for our plant. Even as iron ore would have been the best option, we have to look at sponge iron or pellet route,? a senior RINL official said on the sidelines of the 44th annual general meeting of Indian Refractory Makers? Association in the city on Saturday. The company has tried out the pellet route and the sponge iron process is being tested, the official added.

 A number of steel makers in the country are looking at new or split-up units to secure iron ore mining lease. JSW Steel, for example, had earlier planned to set up a steel plant in Bengal at an investment of Rs 12,000-crore investment. The company is now considering splitting it between Jharkhand and Bengal in order to get ore mining lease. Meanwhile, RINL is eyeing multiple deals for coal mining abroad. It has identified three miners in Canada, Colombia and Australia.

 RINL is, however, cautious on making investment abroad. Given the phenomenal rise in coal prices from $56 a tonne to $125 a tonne, the miners are seeking a premium for giving a stake. The Canadian company, for instance, is seeking $75 million for a meagre 10 per cent stake.

 ?Being a public sector company, we have to be cautious about making such a hefty investment,? said S.R. Kamath, executive director of RINL. 

 Overseas coal equity, however, will not suffice the requirement of the company when it expands steel making capacity to 7 mt going forward. For a 7-mt plant, RINL will require about 7 mt of coal. 

 The participation in coal mining abroad will provide additional volume along with the existing long-term contracts. At present, coal samples are being tested to see if they are compatible with long term contract. Coal from the Canadian mine has been found suitable.

 HSBC bets big on India

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Fresh flow

 Mumbai, March 10: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) has set aside $243 million for its Indian operations to support its rising retail and commercial business. 

 While the bank will inject $150 million as fresh capital, another $93 million will be generated through profits from its Indian operations.

 HSBC also plans to set up a wholly-owned non-banking finance subsidiary (NBFC) for its consumer finance business.

 Apart from $150 million fresh capital, close to $30 million will come from retained profits in 2003-04 and another $63 million will be injected in June from retained profits generated during this fiscal. 

 The fresh infusion of funds this month will increase HSBCs capital adequacy ratio for its Indian operations to 13.5 per cent from 10 per cent in December last year.

 Niall S. Booker, group general manager and CEO of HSBC in India, said the allocated funds will be used to support the growth of retail banking and commercial banking operations here.

 Booker said while HSBC was also looking to grow through the inorganic route, this course is by definition ?opportunistic?. The bank?s primary focus now is on organic growth. He added that India, along with China, Brazil and Mexico have been identified by the group as one of the markets where strong growth is likely over the next few years.

 ?Our Indian operations have demonstrated strong organic growth and the additional capital is expected to support our growth strategy,? he pointed out. 

 In India, even as the balancesheet size of HSBC is put at around $6 billion, the banks home loan portfolio during the current fiscal has grown by 85 per cent and credit cards in force have risen by 28 per cent. 

 Booker said he was talking to the Reserve Bank on the status of its investment in UTI Bank. HSBC will be required to bring down its holding in the bank to 5 per cent if the RBIs guidelines on foreign bank holdings in private sector banks are implemented.

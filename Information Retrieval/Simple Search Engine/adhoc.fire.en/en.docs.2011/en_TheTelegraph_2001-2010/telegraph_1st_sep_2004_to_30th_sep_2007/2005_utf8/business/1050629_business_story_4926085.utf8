 Calcutta, June 28: Eveready Industries India Ltd has shelved the plan to set up a manufacturing unit in China. Instead, the company will source raw materials from that country to lower the cost of producing batteries in India.

 Talking to reporters here today after addressing shareholders at the 70th annual general meeting, Deepak Khaitan, executive vice-chairman and managing director, said, ?There is a lack of transparency in the functioning of Chinese companies. Financial data is not available. Moreover, labour laws in China are not acceptable. So, we have decided to put on hold our plans to invest in China.?

 Eveready will import raw materials like electromagnetic dioxide and plastic from China. 

 The company, which produces 1.2 billion batteries per annum, has started exporting batteries to Toshiba of Japan in a small way. In 2004-05, it had exported 25 million batteries to Toshiba. 

 The Japanese firm had sold these batteries in Chile, Australia and Sri Lanka.

 ?We are negotiating with Toshiba for catering to the Japanese market. The quality standards set by Toshiba for Japan is quite high. This year we expect to double our exports to Toshiba,? Khaitan said. 

 Toshiba imports Eveready?s batteries and sells them under its brand name.

 Eveready has also firmed up plans to grow Greendale, its umbrella brand for the packet tea business. 

 ?We would like to grow the Greendale brand aggressively in the next three years. We may include other products under this umbrella brand. Our internal team is preparing the roadmap, which will be placed before the board in the next two to three months,? Khaitan said.

 The packet tea business of the company has witnessed a 35 per cent CAGR in 2004-05. It sells packet tea under brand names Tez, Jago and Premium.

 Shareholders have raised questions on dividend payment at the AGM. Reacting to this, Khaitan said, ?Monsoon is good, although it has come late. We expect business to be better in coming months. If things go well, by September we expect to announce an interim dividend.?

 The company is setting up a state-of-the-art battery manufacturing unit in Uttaranchal at a cost of Rs 65-70 crore to meet growing demands. It will manufacture 400 million batteries per annum.

 Shareholders have approved all resolutions of the company, including the appointment of Sanjiv Goenka and Diwan Arun Nanda as directors.

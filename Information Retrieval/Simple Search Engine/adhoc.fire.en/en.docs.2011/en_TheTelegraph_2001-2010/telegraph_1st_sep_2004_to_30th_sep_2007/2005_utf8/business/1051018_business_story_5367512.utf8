 Helmsman hunt hots up at UTI-II

 New Delhi, Oct. 17: UTI Asset Management Company (UTI-AMC) will soon get a chief executive officer.

 Sources in UTI-AMC, also called UTI-II, said the next board meeting, scheduled for October 21, is likely to take up the appointment issue.

 The names of A.K. Sridhar (chief investment officer of UTI-AMC), D.S.R. Murthy (executive director of UTI-AMC) and U.K. Sinha (joint secretary, Capital Markets, Ministry of Finance) are doing the rounds.

 At present, the AMC is headed by R.H. Patil ? a non-executive chairman. The executive decisions are taken by a two-member committee of executive directors, comprising Sridhar and Murthy.

 UTI-II was recently sold off to a consortium of four PSU financial institutions. 

 The AMC board will also be restructured to accommodate more members of the four stakeholders ? the State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Bank of Baroda and Life Insurance Corporation.

 At present, the board has five other members, besides Patil. They are Vinayshil Gautam, G.P. Muniappan, S.H. Bhojani, J.S. Mathur and U.K. Sinha.

 It is unlikely that a top executive from any of the four sponsors would be appointed as the chief of the AMC, given the Sebi guidelines on independent directors, sources said. 

 However, the representatives have to reach a consensus while selecting the chief executive officer.

 Usually, the chief executive officer is also co-opted as a member on the board. In case the chief executive officer is an executive of any one of the sponsors, the person can no longer be an independent director, an official of the asset management company said.

 The asset management company may also decide to appoint a chief executive officer without making the person a board member, if the official has a strong association with any of the four sponsor institutions.

 UTI was bifurcated into two separate entities in early 2003 ? UTI-AMC and Specified Undertaking of UTI (SUUTI), also called UTI-I. 

 UTI-I handled all the defunct assured-return schemes of the erstwhile parent company, including US-64. 

 UTI-I will eventually be wound up after liquidation of assets to meet liabilities.

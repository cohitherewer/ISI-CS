 Tighter leash on phantom companies

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 2: The ministry of company affairs has developed a model first information report (FIR) for filing complaints with the police for serious offences by fraudulent companies. 

 FIRs have been filed in 92 cases so far for offences punishable under various sections of the Indian Penal Code. The ministry has taken action against vanishing firms and their promoters or directors according to the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956.

 The Sebi has also taken a series of measures to protect small investors. These include strengthening the entry norms for firms accessing the primary market and making the disclosure norms in offer documents more stringent.

 Sebi has also changed its policy regarding primary issues by defining the retail individual investor and reviewing the book-building guidelines.

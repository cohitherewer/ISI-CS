 Calcutta, Aug. 18: A committee, set up by the government to suggest ways to develop the corporate bond market, is expected to submit its report in a couple of months. The committee is headed by UTI Asset Management Company chairman R.H. Patil.

 ?The government had formed the committee a month back. It includes representatives from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and other apex organisations and independent experts,? National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) chairman and managing director C.B. Bhave said on the sidelines of an interaction organised by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

 The panel will examine the corporate bonds and securitisation issues, including legal, regulatory and tax factors, and the market design. This year?s budget promised the appointment of the panel as part of measures to improve the domestic capital market.

 Bhave said while the domestic equity market has acquired depth, there is an absence of volume in the debt market. Apart from the government, multilateral institutions have also expressed concern at the limited possibilities of raising debt from the domestic market, which is dominated by government securities.

 In the absence of variety in the domestic capital markets, domestic companies are tapping global markets to raise low-cost funds. This is particularly true for long-term infrastructure projects, where the domestic debt markets provide sub-optimal financing.

 Moreover, raising finance from abroad enables firms to hedge interest rate and foreign exchange risks associated with such financing. This makes both short-term and long-term external debt attractive. However, the cost involved in raising equity from abroad goes up to as much as 10 per cent of the proceeds.

 The government also plans to amend the definition of ?securities? under the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956, to provide a legal framework for trading.

 Regarding the plans of NSDL, Bhave said the company expects to increase its share from non-mainstream revenues in the coming years to almost two to three times of the mainstream revenue from depository services.

 NSDL has networked 50 accredited warehouses and enabled holding of commodity balances in electronic form and dematerialised the warehouse receipt in partnership with NCDEX. NSDL has also established a nationwide Tax Information Network on behalf of the income tax department.

 ?We are keen on becoming the central record keeping agency for pensions once the bill passes,? said Bhave. NSDL had garnered revenues worth almost Rs 100 crore last fiscal.

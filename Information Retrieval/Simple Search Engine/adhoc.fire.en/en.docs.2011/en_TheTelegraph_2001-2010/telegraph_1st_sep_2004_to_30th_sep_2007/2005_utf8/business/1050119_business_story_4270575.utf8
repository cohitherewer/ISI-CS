 Oil majors join forces for Libyan exploration

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 18: Oil India Ltd (OIL) will join hands with big brother ONGC Videsh (OVL) to bid for an oil exploration block in Libya this month.

 The bids would be submitted within this month for the block, which is being offered on a production-sharing basis, OIL chairman R. K. Dutta said on the sidelines of Petrotech-2005.

 While the government has identified OVL as the lead company for fast-track clearance of proposals for overseas acquisition, it also feels that the Indian companies should follow a consortium approach to take on foreign competition.

 This has become imperative in view of the aggressive bidding by Chinese companies, which have been pipping Indian companies to the post.

 Meanwhile, OVL is also gearing up for participation in oil exploration in Ecuador and bidding for a new refinery project there. 

 Ecuador energy minister Eduardo Lopez Robayo said OVL has expressed interest to participate in the appraisal and development of ITT blocks in his country. 

 However, ONGC would have to compete with Chinese, Canadian and Japanese companies as Ecuador was going through the international bidding route for awarding these projects.

 In a meeting that he held with his Indian counterpart Mani Shankar Aiyar, it was also decided that OVL would work with the state-owned PetroEcuador on joint projects in the hydrocarbon sector in Ecuador and other countries.

 ONGC will also provide training to geo-scientists and engineers of Ecuador in its institutes in petroleum exploration, drilling, production, safety, environment, management and foreign trade.

 The minister said he had visited the ONGC installations in India and was impressed with the company?s expertise. 

 According to the agreement reached with the Indian minister, ONGC would provide for technical training to personnel in the Ecuador hydrocarbon sector.

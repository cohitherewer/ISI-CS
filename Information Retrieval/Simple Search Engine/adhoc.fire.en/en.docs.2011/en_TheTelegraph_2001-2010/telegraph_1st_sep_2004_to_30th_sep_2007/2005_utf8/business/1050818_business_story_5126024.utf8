 Bourses get Reliance demerger blueprint

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 17: Reliance Industries Ltd today filed the demerger plan with stock exchanges. The proposal will enable four companies to come out of Mukesh Ambanis RIL fold and join Anil Ambanis ADA Enterprises.

 To facilitate this, a series of transactions were recently conducted between the holding companies that had shares in Reliance Energy and Reliance Capital.

 It is estimated that 23 lakh RIL shareholders will get an equal number of shares in four special purpose vehicles, which will later be merged with the four companies in the ADAE fold. The detailed scheme will see telecom, energy, financial services and a shell company ? called Global Fuel Management Services Ltd ?coming out of RIL control. Global Fuel will handle all gas deals between the Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance Industries Ltd and Anil Ambanis Reliance Energy Ltd.

 It is believed that the filing of the demerger plan will ultimately pave the way for the listing of the four companies on the bourses.

 Shares of Reliance Industries jumped Rs 14.70 to Rs 714.55 today on expectation of gains from the demerger.

 Meanwhile, Anil Ambani, the chairman of the ADAE group, today addressed Reliance Capital shareholders in Jamnagar. 

 Our future lies in emerging as a full-spectrum financial services company. We are also exploring opportunities to scale up our business model on a nationwide basis by deepening our existing relationships with over 5 million consumers of Reliance Energy and over 12 million subscribers of Reliance Infocomm, Anil said.

 The companys recent preferential offer was oversubscribed 12 times by global investors. This happened in a record time of 4 days, during which it drew cash commitments of over Rs 4,500 crore against the offer of $85 million (Rs 370 crore).

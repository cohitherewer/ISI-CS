 VAT meet on Friday

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 13: The empowered committee of state finance ministers on value-added tax has advanced its meeting to April 15 in order to iron out problems with the implementation of the new tax regime in the 23 states that have adopted it from April 1.

 Officials admitted that lack of uniformity in VAT rates among states was a serious issue.

 ?We are ready to admit that VAT rates are not uniform (among states). That is why we have advanced our meeting to April 15-16, which was earlier scheduled for May. This is a serious issue for the panel also,? Ramesh Chandra, secretary of the empowered committee, told reporters on the sidelines of a seminar jointly organised by industry associations, Assocham and PHDCCI.

 He said the failure to implement the VAT regime in the five BJP-ruled states and Tamil Nadu was a politically motivated exercise.

 ?I am at pains that certain political parties who in the earlier regime lobbied for the execution of national VAT are now withdrawing from their previous commitment. This approach and attitude, if not given up, will serve no national cause and a tax reform of VAT?s nature will suffer,? said Chandra.

 The VAT panel will meet state tax commissioners and other officials on April 15, while finance ministers, including those from the states that have not implemented the new tax system, will meet the following day, he added.

 The meeting is likely to address other implementation issues as well.

 States, including Delhi, have assured the panel in writing that they will abide by the consensus in the empowered committee.

 On the issue of traders? petition to Delhi lieutenant governor B. L. Joshi against the VAT, he said they should come forward for talks with the panel. ?Our doors are always open for negotiations with traders. They should present their case in the panel.?

 According to statistics provided by the committee, revenue of all states will increase by a minimum of 25 per cent with the implementation of a national VAT.

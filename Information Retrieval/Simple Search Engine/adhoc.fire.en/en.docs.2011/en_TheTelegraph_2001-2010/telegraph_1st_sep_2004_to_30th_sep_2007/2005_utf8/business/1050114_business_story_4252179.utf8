 HPL to ramp up capacity 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Good going

 Calcutta, Jan. 13: Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) has drawn up a Rs 700-crore expansion plan. 

 As part of the ramp-up being overseen by ABB Lummus, the company wants to raise ethylene capacity from 5.2 lakh tonnes to 6.5 lakh tonnes by October next year. It plans to increase propylene output too. 

 Principal promoter Purnendu Chatterjee today said HPL is doing well and is set to expand. He, however, was undecided on the company?s long-planned initial public offer (IPO).

 Talking to reporters on the sidelines of the 11th PartnerShip Summit organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) here, Chatterjee said, ?The HPL board has cleared the offering of 30 crore shares. The IPO will happen soon.? 

 Officials do not expect the IPO ? which is being lead managed by Kotak Mahindra Bank, DSP Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan ? to be launched in this financial year. The earliest it could be launched is in the first quarter of next fiscal. 

 On Indian Oil, Chatterjee said: ?Many things are being taken into consideration. We are not averse to the entry of IOC.? 

 Chatterjee, who had earlier stonewalled the Fortune 500 major?s demand for management control, had not suggested a timeframe within which the company would approve its fresh investment proposal of Rs 150 crore for a 7.5 per cent stake. Nor has the board of HPL taken a view on the funding proposal.

 Amid the stake-shuffle talk, the company has repaid Rs 325 crore to its lenders on the back of better operating performance this fiscal. According to Chatterjee, HPL?s debt burden is now Rs 3,200 crore, which has to be serviced at the rate of Rs 250 crore annually.

 The company is generating cash worth Rs 90-100 crore per month. In December, the company achieved a sales of Rs 614 crore. ?We are likely to clock sales of Rs 6,000 crore this fiscal against Rs 4,500 crore in the previous fiscal,? said chief executive Swapan Bhowmik.

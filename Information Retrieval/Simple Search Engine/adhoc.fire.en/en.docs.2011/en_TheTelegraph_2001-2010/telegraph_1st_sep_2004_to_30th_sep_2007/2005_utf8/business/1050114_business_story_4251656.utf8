 Cabinet lobs SEZ to panel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 13: The cabinet today deferred a decision on a controversial law on special economic zones, which treats these zones as virtual foreign territories for all purposes, after several ministers pointed out problems in the way the legislation has been framed.

 There were apprehensions that the law would place the SEZs outside the purview of the Indian criminal law. The cabinet has finally asked the Prime Minister to set up a group of ministers (GoM) to study the proposed legislation and suggest suitable changes.

 The SEZ law, which is modelled on Chinese rules, is expected to give a fillip to foreign investment. It allows for relaxed labour conditions, a 20-year tax holiday, duty-free imports and easier norms for investment.

 The cabinet, however, took a number of significant economic decisions, including raising the capital subsidy ceiling for powerlooms from Rs 60 lakh to Rs 1 crore under the technology upgradation fund scheme (TUF) and an increase in the rate of subsidy capital investment by small jute and textiles units from 12 per cent to 15 per cent. The move is expected to help units in Andhra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal among others.

 The cabinet committee on economic affairs, which also met immediately after the cabinet meeting, approved a Rs 336-crore capital investment in an open cast mine named Bhubaneshwari open cast as also a capital investment of Rs 96 crore in Kaniha open cast mining project. Both projects are to be set up by Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd.

 Bhubaneswari has a total coal reserve of 741 million tonnes, of which 374 million tonnes will be mined by this project, while Kaniha has reserves of 756 million tonnes, of which 93 million tonnes will be exploited by the project.

 The CCEA also allocated higher outlays for setting up Nalco?s rolled product unit at Angul. The 50,000 tonnes per year plant is to be completed by July and will now cost Rs 398 crore instead of an earlier estimate of Rs 365 crore.

 It also approved a revised proposal for setting up a Rs 2,118-crore international container transhipment terminal at Cochin port. The project, to be implemented on a build, operate and transfer basis, will be awarded to Dubai Ports International.

 On completion of the project, the terminal will have facilities to handle 3 million TEUs (20 feet equivalent units). Vessels up to the size of 8,000 TEUs will be handled at the terminal.

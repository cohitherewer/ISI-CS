 Vinay Bharat Ram: In exit mode

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: In a major restructuring of the DCM board, six directors of the company have resigned.

 They include Vinay Bharat Ram, chairman and managing director, and Hemant Bharat Ram, chief technology officer. P. K. Jain, D. H. Pai Panandikar, Shashi Ullal and Bipin Maira are the others who have left.

 ?There are some technical reasons because of which we are resigning. I don?t know much because I have not been attending the last few board meetings,? Panandiker said.

 Another senior official declined comment on the reasons why the six directors quit. He skirted questions on whether the departures were a precursor to a restructuring by saying it was ?the board?s decision? all the way.

 The company informed exchanges that the board accepted the resignations, and appointed three others as directors. Surender Nath Pandey has come in as the chairman, Naresh Kumar Jain as the managing director while Jitendra Tuli has been taken in as a director.

 Earlier this month, DCM Limited informed the National Stock Exchange that the auditors had conducted the limited review of its unaudited financial results for the quarter ended September 30. It is not known if the resignations have anything to do with the review. DCM reported a turnover of Rs 26.37 crore in the period, a fall of 16 per cent from the year-ago tally of Rs 31.44 crore. 

 However, sales had risen marginally by 3.8 per cent over the Rs 25.41 crore notched up in April-June. In 2004-05, sales plummeted 54.8 per cent to Rs 122.5 crore from Rs 271.06 crore in the previous year. Profit after tax also fell 94 per cent to Rs 11 lakh from Rs 2..02 crore. 

 The company has been restructuring its operations, as part of which the DCM board approved the proposal to merge DCM Realty Investment and Consulting Limited (a 100 per cent subsidiary) with itself in May this year.

 DCM started operations in 1889 with a spinning mill in Delhi but diversified into a number of businesses. These include cotton, synthetic yarns and textiles, rayon tyre cord, sugar, alcohol and confectionery, heavy chemicals and fertilisers, vanaspati, PVC resin and calculators.

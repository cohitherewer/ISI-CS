 Voice-vote victory for patents bill 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Nath: The navigator

 New Delhi, March 22: The Lok Sabha today passed the controversial patents bill after the government won over the Left parties by accepting several of their amendments while NDA, the original proponents of the measure, walked out.

 The bill, which seeks to replace an ordinance issued in December to fulfil world trade obligations to allow product patents on drugs and agri-products, was passed by a voice vote after commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath agreed to refer two of the Left parties proposals to an expert committee.

 The NDA, with which the government held last minute discussions for evolving a consensus, stuck to its stand that the bill should be referred to a parliamentary committee for further discussion. The opposition proposal was negated.

 Moving the bill, Nath criticised the BJP-led NDA for opposing the measure saying it was their government which had originally initiated it in 2003 and was now backtracking just because it was on the other side.

 He dismissed fears that the patents bill would encourage multinational drug companies and that the prices of essential drugs would shoot up.

 The Left parties said they supported the bill as the government had accepted 10 of the 12 amendments in core areas suggested by them. The amendments related to the definition of inventiveness, new inventions, compulsory licensing, royalty, permit to produce and the issue of raising pre-grant objections.

 The bill was passed after the adoption of 15 amendments moved by the government. In fact, the Opposition, led by the BJP, was stumped in the Lok Sabha today by the unexpected show of camaraderie between the UPA and the Left parties. The BJP was hoping to cash in on a rift between the government and its supporting allies on the patents bill.

 CPM member Roopchand Pal who spoke on the bill showered accolades on the UPA government for doing a ?good job? with the bill. ?I rise to support the bill. We have not changed our position on the bill. But the UPA government has accepted all our amendments,? he said amid applause from the treasury bench members.

 Much to the delight of the Congress he attacked the main opposition party with gusto. Pal accused the BJP of treating such an important legislation casually. ?They brought the bill,? Pal said and added, ?we suggested important amendments but they will not listen to us.?

 ?We are happy that the CPM has stuck to its assurance in the common minimum programme (CMP),? said Pal. 

 The CMP says that the UPA government will take steps to see that life saving drugs are available at reasonable prices.

 New Delhi, June 15: Hindustan Motors today said it was in talks with foreign carmakers, including Germany?s Volkswagen, to supply components to them. 

 HM is targeting over Rs 300 crore business from component supply in the next three years. ?Volkswagen is in talks with us for panels and we are also talking to other carmakers like Peugeot and Mitsubishi,? said Ashwani Dubey, executive vice-president of Hindustan Motors.

 The GP-CK Birla group company manufactures most of the components, including those for its in-house requirements, at its plant in Uttarpara in Bengal. Dubey said the quantum of business from components stood at around Rs 200 crore last fiscal, which included Rs 150-170 crore for internal consumption. 

 ?While Rs 150-170 crore was used for our internal consumption, actual outsourcing last fiscal was about Rs 25 crore,? he said. 

 ?We estimate component outsourcing from Uttarpara could cross Rs 300 crore in the next three years,? he added.

 The Uttarpara facility, which contributes about 40 per cent to HM?s overall revenues and where the company makes the flagship Ambassador model, has excess capacity in component manufacturing. 

 ?We are planning to make this into a component hub and expect that in the next three years, the revenues from component outsourcing business will be equal to those from the sale of Ambassador cars,? said Dubey.

 Besides direct outsourcing, the Uttarpara plant also supplies components to HM?s Indore plant where they are used to manufacture engines. These engines are supplied to carmakers like General Motors and Ford. 

 He said the plant had a current monthly capacity of 1,000 tonnes of forgings and an equal capacity in castings, apart from two lakh stampings per day. 

 Grand launch

 HM today launched the CNG Bharat Stage (III) Ambassador Grand in the capital at a price tag of Rs 4 lakh.

 Facing a stiff competition in the market, Ambassador managed a meagre 4 per cent increase in sales last fiscal to about 12,600 cars, with nearly 1,000 cars coming from personal use segment. 

 In the near future, HM expects to sell about 150 cars per month in the personal-use segment.

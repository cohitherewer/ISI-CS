 Regulator keeps vigil on telecom service quality

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 23: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today released a consultation paper on the review of quality of service parameters of basic and cellular mobile telephone services. 

 Trai has been monitoring the quality of service (QOS) of basic and cellular operators vis-?-vis the parameters laid down by the regulator.

 The timeframe set for achieving the quality benchmark (36 months for cellular mobile telephone service and 48 months for basic service) is already over and the performance of the operators is not satisfactory.

 The regulator had been discussing this matter with the service providers. 

 During these meetings, basic service operators had indicated certain constraints and had suggested a review of some specific parameters.

 As a result, Trai today released a consultation paper incorporating suggestions of the basic service operators.

 Further, the independent agency appointed by Trai to conduct the QOS survey has recommended that there is a need to review some of the parameters for mobile services also. The regulator has examined these recommendations, discussed the matter with mobile operators and has also noted a number of new developments in the mobile sector ? like the introduction of CDMA phones ? since the QOS parameters were specified in 2000.

 In view of these developments, Trai has proposed some changes in the QOS parameters for mobile service.

 The consultation paper reviews the implementation of the present QOS parameters and presents a number of issues raised by the service providers on these parameters. 

 It also discusses the need for prescribing new parameters and measures needed for effective implementation of the QOS benchmarks, including the possibility of imposing penalties in case of violation of the QOS parameters. 

 Trai has invited responses from the stakeholders by March 21.

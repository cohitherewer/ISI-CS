 OUR BUREAUX

 July 19: The Vishakhapatnam Steel Plant of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd has posted a profit before tax of Rs 489 crore for the first quarter ended June 30 on a sales turnover of Rs 1,368 crore.

 The state-owned plant has reported a marginal drop in sales from Rs 1,383 crore posted in the same period last year. 

 Sources in the company said VSP, which had slashed steel prices by Rs 2,000-3,000 per tonne, would not go for any price correction till the end of August. It expects steel prices to firm up in September.

 Y. Shiv Sagar Rao, chairman and managing director of RINL, said an investment of Rs 8,259 crore has been earmarked for the expansion of VSPs liquid steel capacity to 6.3 million tonnes by 2008-09. We will borrow around Rs 2,500 crore and the rest will be generated internally.

 A major cost-cutting drive is on the anvil, he added. The plant is focussing on value-added products to remain competitive in the market.

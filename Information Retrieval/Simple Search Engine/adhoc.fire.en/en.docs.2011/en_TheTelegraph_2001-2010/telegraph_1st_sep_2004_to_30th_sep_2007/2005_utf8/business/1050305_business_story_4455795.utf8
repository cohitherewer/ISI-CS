 Venezuela oil deal today

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 4: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today said India was likely to get a stake in the San Crastobal oilfield in Venezuela, which produces around 100,000 barrels of oil per day.

 Aiyar told reporters after the meeting with visiting Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez that an MoU would be signed tomorrow to pave the way for clinching the deal.

 Aiyar discussed with Chavez the possibility of Indian oil companies taking a 49 per cent stake in onshore San Cristobal oilfield in eastern Venezuela and two offshore gas fields. Venezuela is also keen to export crude to India.

 ?The Venezuelan President said San Cristobal can be made available to us. We have shown our interest and want the joint co-operation agreement, which we plan to sign tomorrow, to reflect Venezuela?s commitment,? Aiyar said.

 ?Venezuela is our arrowhead in Latin America,? he said, adding a foray into oil and gas exploration in Venezuela would give Indian firms a head start in collaboration with neighbouring countries in the hydrocarbon sector.

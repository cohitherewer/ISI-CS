 AstraZeneca says no to merger

 Tom McKillop: Hard talk

 Stockholm, Sept. 5 (Reuters): AstraZeneca Plcs outgoing chief executive poured cold water on the idea that the drug maker might merge with GlaxoSmithKline Plc, saying on Monday it had no reason to enter merger talks.

 We have no strategic need to be bigger ? none at all. So there is no reason to engage in major M amp;A activity, Tom McKillop said while attending the European Society of Cardiology congress in Stockholm.

 Speculation that AstraZeneca might sell out to its larger British rival was fuelled in July by news that McKillop was stepping down at the end of 2005 in favour of insider David Brennan, the groups head of the US operations.

 Some industry analysts have suggested that McKillops exit could ease any merger process.

 An all British tie-up, matching the creation of French drugs giant Sanofi-Aventis SA last year, would give Glaxo better access to key cardiovascular and cancer markets. But overlaps in other areas, such as respiratory medicine, would require significant divestments to appease anti-trust officials.

 McKillop said AstraZeneca remained focused on internally generated growth. But he acknowledged recent pipeline setbacks meant it could be more open to licensing in drugs from other firms than in the past, if this made economic sense.

 There was a period when our development resources were so heavily committed to the late-stage projects that we would have found it difficult to take in a very late-stage development project. But now we could do that, he said.

 Symbicort approval

 McKillop added that AstraZeneca was on track to file its Symbicort asthma drug for approval in the United States by the end of this month.

 The inhaled medicine, which competes with Glaxos Advair, is already a major seller in Europe but is not yet available in the US market.

 Winning a final green light from the US Food and Drug Administration is likely to take time, however, since the regulator needs to assess both the drug and its delivery device. The typical review time in this division, the period to approval, is something like two years, McKillop said.

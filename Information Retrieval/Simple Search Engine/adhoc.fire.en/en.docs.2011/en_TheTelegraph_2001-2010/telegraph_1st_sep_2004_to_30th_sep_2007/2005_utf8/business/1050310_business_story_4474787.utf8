 Lenovo clears US hurdle

 New horizon 

 San Francisco, March 9 (Reuters): China?s Lenovo Group Ltd won clearance from a US national security oversight committee to acquire IBM?s personal computer business, the companies said on Wednesday, overcoming resistance from some US lawmakers.

 An IBM executive said the high-level US committee had given the deal its unanimous consent ? the final external approval needed ? putting the $1.25-billion PC sale on track to close in the second quarter as originally planned.

 ?We were able to get unanimous agreement from the members of the committee,? Stephen Ward, the general manager of IBM?s personal systems division, said in a telephone interview. Ward is to become chief executive of Lenovo, which is headquartered in Beijing, once the deal closes.

 The merger of the IBM PC business with China?s biggest PC maker ? the first combination ever of a major US corporation and a top Chinese one ? will create the world?s third largest PC maker and one strongly positioned in several fast-growing markets. The deal met unexpected resistance when some US lawmakers began decrying the loss of a US-based PC maker to China, and officials whispered that Chinese nationals working for Lenovo in the US might act as industrial spies.

 Ward said terms of the approval are confidential, but that no compromises were required over the location of Lenovo facilities in sensitive research areas, nor were limits put on Lenovo?s ability to sell PCs to US agencies. ?I don?t think we made any compromises at all,? Ward said.

 Rival PC makers such as Dell Inc and Hewlett-Packard Co have been seeking to woo corporate PC customers away from IBM by citing the regulatory overhang as well as uncertainty over Lenovo?s future PC product strategy.

 Industry experts say that underlying the cross-border combination of the two companies is a belated recognition of the fact that most PCs ? including IBM?s machines ? are already largely produced in the greater China region.

 IBM plans to keep a 19 per cent stake in Lenovo after the merger, allow Lenovo to use its PC brands for five years, and retain service, financing and support operations for PCs.

 The go-ahead from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS) was received on Tuesday, Ward said.

 CFIUS, which is composed of 11 US agencies and was created in 1998 to conduct security reviews of business deals, includes members of the US departments of treasury, state, defence, justice and homeland security. ?Everything that CFIUS asked of us was perfectly reasonable and the type of things that would be in a business plan,? he said.

 He said staff working in the Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, area will be relocated to a central facility that is being sold by IBM to Lenovo and is located in the same industrial park. Asked if IBM could retain US military and other national security agencies as PC customers, Ward said there were no restrictions on the new Lenovo.

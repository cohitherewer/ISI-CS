 AIG set to float asset company

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 20: American International Group (AIG), the US-based insurance firm, is about to roll out its asset management business in India. 

 AIG, which has partnered the Tatas for a life insurance venture in India, has signed Franklin Templeton Indias former president Ravi Mehrotra to set up its asset management business in India and look after the Asian region.

 Mehrotra, who is largely credited with making Franklin Templeton among the countrys top fund houses, founded Kothari Pioneer, the countrys first privately-held fund house. Later on, Franklin Templeton acquired Kothari Pioneer and Mehrotra moved to the top job at Franklin Templeton India that time. 

 Hence, Mehrotras joining the AIG group to spearhead its asset management initiatives in the country is seen with great interest, though the US firm is holding its India plans close to its heart and the company officials declined any comments.

 Mehrotra will join as the regional head of AIG Global Investment Groups (AIGIG) Asia asset management companies. He is expected to join by January next year.

 Speaking on Mehrotras appointment, AIG Global Investment Groups (AGIG) chairman and chief executive Win Neuger said, Asia and India in particular will be a key are of growth for the investment business in 2006. We firmly believe Mehrotras appointment is a harbinger of AIGIGs future success in the region.

 AIGIG is the holding company of a group of companies which provide investment advice and deal in asset management products and services. As of September 30, AIGIG has $508 billion worth of assets spanning equities, fixed income, private equity, hedge and real estate, under its management.

 Some of the overseas fund houses that are currently operating in India include Principal, Franklin Templeton. Merrill Lynch and Prudential, the latest entrant is Fidelity. The industry buzz is that T Rowe Price is also contemplating India venture anytime soon.

 These apart, foreign banks such as HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Standard Chartered, ABN Amro have also spawned their own asset management arms.

 Fresh funds for co-op banks sought

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 5: The A. Vaidyanathan committee on the co-operative sector submitted a report to the government, seeking massive infusion of capital into these institutions for their revival. The panel, set up in August 2004, has held multiple layers of control and widespread inefficiencies responsible for eroding the profitability of co-operatives, besides raising costs substantially.

 The panel has also suggested fresh changes in laws to enable restructuring of the co-operative sector.

 Meanwhile, the government also finalised a white paper on value-added tax (VAT) today, which will be formally issued on January 17. The empowered committee of state finance ministers met here to fine-tune the draft and finalise the white paper that would spell out the structure of VAT and other procedural details.

 ?I am happy to announce that the white paper has been finalised and the empowered committee has endorsed it. It will be issued on January 17,? VAT panel chairman Asim Dasgupta said after the meeting.

 Dasgupta said the committee interacted with trade and industry bodies, which have pointed out ground-level difficulties in implementing VAT and demanded a more liberal penal cause for non-compliance.

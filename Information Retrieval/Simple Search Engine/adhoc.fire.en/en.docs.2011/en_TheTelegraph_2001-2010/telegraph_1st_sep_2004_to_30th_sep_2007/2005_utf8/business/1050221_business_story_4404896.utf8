The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Push to IDBI recast deadline

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Makeover move

 Calcutta, Feb. 20: The top brass of Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) wants the restructuring initiated by previous chairman and managing director M. Damodaran to be completed in March.

 Though the new chairman and managing director J.N. Godbole will continue till May 31, there is apprehension among senior executives that Damodaran?s departure will slow the revamp process. ?The merger of IDBI and IDBI Bank has been on track so far. However, the sudden change at the top has led to uncertainty among employees,? said a senior official of IDBI.

 What should reassure staff of the financial institution are reports that the finance ministry will soon start the process of selecting a new chief. Chances are a joint secretary might be picked as Godbole?s successor. 

 Amid the uncertainty, Gautam Gan, head of IDBI Bank?s retail division for the eastern and western regions, is leaving to join as vice-president of Deutsche Bank.

 Officials say after the merger, IDBI and IDBI Bank are expected to function as strategic business units, each concentrating on its core strength ? the former on industrial credit and the latter on providing retail loans.

 IDBI Bank suffers from a growth-retarding problem of capital adequacy. 

 ?After we announced the merger, the bank has recorded good growth rates. It has set up more branches and has drawn up ambitious expansion plans. The merger brings to the bank not just additional capital but also relationships that we at IDBI have assiduously built over the last four decades. There are clear synergies and cost savings. Damodaran wanted a cut in transaction costs and greater efficiency,? the officials said, adding the former chief had chalked out ambitious plans for expansion and introduction of innovative products. IDBI is also witnessing a rise in demand for industrial credit. ?Industrial credit is certainly picking up, and the industry is buzzing with activity. There is optimism all around and the economy is on a path of sustained growth. Companies will not miss out on the great opportunity,? an official added.

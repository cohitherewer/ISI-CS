 ICI to buy out Lever in Quest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 5: ICI India Limited will buy out the stake of Hindustan Lever Limited (HLL) in Quest India International Limited, a joint venture between the two companies.

 ICI India will acquire the right to buy the 49 per cent stake held by HLL after March 31, 2006, said ICI India chief financial officer and executive director M. R. Rajaram. The paints major at present holds 51 per cent in Quest India.

 Once Quest India is transformed into a wholly-owned subsidiary, it would help us increase our operational efficiency, Rajaram said. Quest India contributed nearly 12 per cent of ICI Indias consolidated turnover of Rs 974 crore in 2004-05.

 Most of our restructuring process is now over. Whatever remains to be done, will be completed soon, said Aditya Narayan, chairman of ICI India, to the shareholders at the annual general meeting held here today.

 Our rubber chemicals business is not doing well. So, we are focussing on preventing losses, said Rajaram. We shall concentrate on our paints business along with Uniqema, National Starch and Quest, he added.

 We might utilise the companys Rs 360-crore cash reserve to fund inorganic growth (read acquisitions and mergers) in these four segments. However, we will take a call if the proposals are suitable, explained Rajaram.

 ICI Plc, the parent company, had divested the rubber chemicals business in 1970. The Indian unit since then had carried out research and development in this line of business to improve profitability. We shall infuse another Rs 3 crore to keep the business going, Rajaram said.

 Over the last few quarters, ICI has been witnessing faster growth in the paints business than the industry average. 

 For the first quarter of current fiscal, we have achieved a growth of 25 per cent against industry average of around 10 per cent and we expect to maintain the momentum in the remaining quarters of this year, he added.

 PowerGrid eases purchase norms

 Power play

 New Delhi, March 24: The Powergrid Corporation of India Ltd today enabled companies to buy power in continuous blocks of six, 12 and 24 hours under a new open access scheme.

 PowerGrid today issued a detailed procedure and pricing scheme for those (like state electricity boards and private companies) seeking power under open access from the inter-state transmission system.

 The charges will be based on the duration of supply, a company statement said.

 PowerGrid has introduced the open access system based on the directives of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC).

 Under the system, two types of customers have been identified ? short-term and long-term.

 A long-term customer is one who has or intends to enter into a long-term bulk power transmission agreement with a service provider. The customer will have an exit option to relinquish or transfer transmission rights and obligations with the prior approval of the commission. This will be subject to payment of compensation as may be determined by the CERC.

 Short-term customers are those who do not make advance reservations to seek power. They are free to seek open access on a first-come-first-served basis for a maximum period of one month subject to availability of transmission capacity. 

 An exit option has been provided to short-term customers too. They can surrender, cancel or reduce the reserved transmission capacity by paying charges for a minimum of 7 days or the balance period of reservation, whichever is shorter. 

 According to CERC chairman A. K. Basu, the new pricing scheme will be more conducive to future investment in the inter-regional links. The changes will directly benefit the end consumer.

 PowerGrid has also introduced a electronic bidding system on lines suggested by the CERC for short-term consumers to manage congestion, with a maximum bid price capped at 125 per cent of the rate applicable for long-term customers to prevent volatility of transmission prices on the congested corridors.

 Transmission access is an important mechanism to open up the sector. The new pricing scheme for inter-regional links is aimed to significantly reduce the financial burden of the state electricity boards, who have the obligation to reimburse full transmission charges to PowerGrid.

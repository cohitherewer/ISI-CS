 Calcutta, July 3: Telecom companies are eyeing a larger revenue share from the short messaging service (SMS).

 According to In-Stat, a US-based technology research firm, globally, mobile messaging by corporate users will see the biggest growth with revenues increasing six-fold between 2007 and 2009.

 Tata Teleservices (east) chief operating officer Rajesh Puri also has a similar view. We have already tied up with various corporate customers, especially those who have to convey product or other service information to customers. We expect good growth in the next two years with value-added services, including SMS, contributing to 15-20 per cent of the revenue, Puri said. Currently, value-added services account for 7-8 per cent of the national revenue for Tata Teleservices.

 Regarding the volume of messages, an AirTel spokesperson said, On an average, more than 10 million messages are sent on our network every day.

 The short messaging service contributed to 6.3 per cent of the total revenues from mobile services of AirTel last financial year compared with 3.9 per cent in 2004-05.

 Reliance Infocomm also sees good growth in data use in the next few years. It expects one-third of the revenues to come from data.

 Messaging has also grown with more young people using mobile phones. Moreover, most carriers offer group SMS at reduced rates and free SMS during off-peak hours.

 In-Stat, however, feels that revenue from SMS is levelling off and will decline in the future due to less price elasticity, resulting from mature competition in developed regions. Margins, however, will remain good for most carriers because of the inherent profitability of SMS.

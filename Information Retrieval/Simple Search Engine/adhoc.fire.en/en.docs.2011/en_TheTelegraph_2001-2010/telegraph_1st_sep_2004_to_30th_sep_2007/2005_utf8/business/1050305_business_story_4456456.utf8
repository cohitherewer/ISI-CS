 New Delhi, March 4: Finance minister P. Chidambaram is gung ho over the way the stock markets have responded to his budget.

 ?Investors in the stock market are richer by Rs 72,000 crore in the five days since the budget was presented,? the finance minister said while addressing industrialists at a post-budget interaction organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 Chidambaram has an enviable record: he is probably the only finance minister who has had a hattrick of sorts. In the past 10 years, there have been only four budgets that have seen the sensex whoop in celebration: three of them were presented by Chidambaram.

 But while the stock markets have been enlivened by the budget, the bond markets have shown no signs of euphoria with the yield on the 10-year benchmark federal bond staying flat at 6.6179 per cent and corporate bond yields equally subdued.

 The biggest concern weighing on the bond market is the sharp surge in the government borrowings projected in 2005-06 for which the government has budgeted Rs 1,00,836 crore. 

 However, more worrying is the 154 per cent surge in the borrowings targeted under the market stabilisation scheme (MSS) to Rs 123,841 crore in 2005-06 from Rs 48,455 crore in the previous year.

 The MSS, which was only launched last year, is designed to primarily soak up the liquidity in the banking system arising from the huge foreign exchange inflows. 

 Under a pact between the government and the Reserve Bank in March last year, borrowings under the MSS were capped at Rs 60,000 crore. 

 No limit has been set for this year but then the government has pressed the pause button on the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) for one year and may have felt less constrained to pre-determine the borrowing limit under the MSS.

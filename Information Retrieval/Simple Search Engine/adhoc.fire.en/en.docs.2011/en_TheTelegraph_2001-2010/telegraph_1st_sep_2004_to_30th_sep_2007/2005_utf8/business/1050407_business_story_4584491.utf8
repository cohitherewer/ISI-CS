The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Late call on Hutch offer

 Mumbai, April 6: The delay in the announcement of detailed guidelines on how telecom companies can raise foreign investment cap to 74 per cent has pushed back Hutchison Essar?s long-planned initial public offer (IPO).

 Sources confirmed the issue is now likely to hit the market not before the third or fourth quarter of this year, instead of June, as originally planned. This follows statements made by senior Hutchison Telecommunications International officials in Hong Kong in which they were quoted as having said that the suspense on FDI details would force a delay in the flotation.

 The sources, who said the maiden issue would still get off the block this year, blamed the lack of clarity on key issues. The most important of these was the question of whether the 74 per cent limit includes the money ploughed in by foreign institutional investors (FIIs).

 ?There are other aspects where details are awaited. For instance, while the current regulations do not permit NRIs to hold key posts, it is expected that after the FDI hike, they would be allowed to do so,? they added.

 In February this year, the Hutch-Essar combine folded their sprawl of businesses in 13 circles, run by six entities then, into Hutchison Max Telecom ? which offers cellular services in Mumbai. Later, once the consolidation is over, the firm will be renamed Hutchison Essar.

 Hutchison Telecom International, owned by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing?s Hutchison Whampoa, is the main promoter of Hutchison in India. The Essar group and Uday Kotak?s Kotak Mahindra Group also own stakes.

 There are indications that the partners with smaller stakes could prefer to sell out of Hutch and invest the money released into businesses they find promising.

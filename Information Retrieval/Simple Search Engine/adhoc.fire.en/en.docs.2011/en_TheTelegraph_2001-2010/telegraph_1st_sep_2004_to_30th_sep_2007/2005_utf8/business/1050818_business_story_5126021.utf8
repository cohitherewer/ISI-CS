 Stocks defy oil nerves, hit a record

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 17: The two-day market moderation gave way to a Wednesday whoop as the sensex barrelled to another historic high of 7859.53 on brisk all-round buying.

 The 91-point gain in the BSE index was not an isolated spurt; the National Stock Exchanges (NSE) nifty pierced the 2400-mark to end at a dizzy 2403.15 points.

 The binge defied the oil boil and fears of an overheated market. Some analysts have warned that Indian shares could be over-valued compared with similar stocks in other emerging economies of Asia. While this has led many to believe that a strong correction is likely, such forecasts have been off the mark recently.

 Todays spurt was not in sync with trends in the global market, where stocks were pounded by concerns over oil.

 On Dalal Street, the benchmark index opened at 7771.78 rallied to its highest-ever peak of 7870.62 before ending at 7859.53 compared with Tuesdays finish of 7768.24. This represented a rise of 91.29 points, or 1.18 per cent, much of it coming from several small-cap stocks.

 The sensex hit an all-time high of 7861.26 on August 12; on August 11, it had ended at 7816.51. That has been overshadowed in todays rally, which drove it up to 7859.53.

 Domestic mutual funds were believed to be big buyers in bluechips as well as shares of smaller companies.

 Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have kept up their purchase tempo. Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) numbers put their buying at $4 million (Rs 17.60 crore) on Tuesday; last Friday, that figure was Rs 275 crore.

 Mutual funds are believed to have made net purchases of Rs 931 crore in recent days. Today, they focused on small-cap shares.

 While most BSE indices ? with the exception of those mirroring healthcare and capital goods scrips ? ended in the positive territory, the small-cap index was the largest gainer, rising 98.79 points to 5622.91 from 5524.12.

 The volume of business on Dalal Street rose to Rs 3505.29 crore from Rs 2915.80 crore on Tuesday. Vivimed Labs was the most active share with a turnover of Rs 247.98 crore, followed by Reliance, ONGC and State Bank of India. 

 Reliance, ONGC, Bajaj Auto were also among the big gainers, as were some steel companies, which sizzled on reports that prices of the commodity will be raised next month.

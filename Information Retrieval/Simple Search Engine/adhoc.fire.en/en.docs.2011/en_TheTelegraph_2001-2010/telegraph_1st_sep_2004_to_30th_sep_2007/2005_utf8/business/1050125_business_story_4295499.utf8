 Tax burns Bengal diesel sales

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Heavy price to pay

 Calcutta, Jan. 24: The Bengal government is losing huge revenues from diesel sales to Jharkhand and the neighbouring country ? Bangladesh ? because of a high sales tax rate.

 From 2003-04, the diesel sales volume in the state has witnessed a sharp decline. In the Calcutta area, the sales declined by 5.4 per cent in 2002-03, while till December 2004, the volume declined by 4.5 per cent compared with the year-ago period.

 Similarly, in the Durgapur area, in 2002-03, the diesel sales volume grew by 1 per cent, while this year, till now it declined by 4.5 per cent.

 In sharp contrast, the sales volume in the Jamshedpur area went up by 21.4 per cent in 2003-04. In the current year, the sales went up by 37.2 per cent so far.

 The volume in the Dhanbad area also increased by 24.8 per cent in the last fiscal, while it has risen by 9.5 per cent so far in the current year.

 The price of diesel in Bengal is about Rs 29 per litre, while that in Jharkhand is around Rs 27 per litre.

 The price differential with Jharkhand works out to around Rs 2, while with Bangladesh, it is as much as Rs 8.

 The excise duty, special excise component and education cess on oil sales are equal in all the states. However, there is an additional sales tax, which varies from one state to the other.

 While Bengal charges 17 per cent tax, Jharkhand levies 15 per cent. It translates into Rs 3.97 per litre for Bengal and Rs 3.47 per litre for Jharkhand, a difference of 50 paise. In addition, the Bengal government charges an additional tax of Re 1 per litre taking the total difference in prices to Rs 1.50.

 Industry officials say the reducing volume is mainly due to the transportation vehicles as they purchase oil on crossing the Bengal border at a cheaper price. Oil industry figures show that the effect has not been much on the petrol sales, which is mainly consumed by private vehicles.

 However, the petrol pumps near Bangladesh are the worst hit. About 10 stations across the 80-km stretch of Krishnanagar-Karimpur belt have witnessed their daily sales volume reduce to below half of what they used to sell even last year.

 Surojit Kundu, owner of Kundu Auto Centre at Najirpur, Nadia, said, ?We have been affected by this for the last couple of years. However, this year the problem has aggravated.?

 ?Till last year, we used to sell 180-200 kilolitres of diesel every month. Now it has dropped to about 90 kilolitres per month,? said Kundu.

 This is the peak season for diesel sales in the area because of the cultivation season when farmers buy oil for agricultural purposes. 

 Kundu said, ?Although the diesel available from Bangladesh is of an inferior quality, farmers are not bothered. They are only sensitive about the price differentiation.?

 Satyendranath Sengupta, another petrol pump owner in Nadia district, said, ?In Indian currency, the price difference is as much as Rs 8 with the oil form Bangladesh costing about Rs 22. It is obvious that the farmers will prefer the oil from the neighbouring country.?

 Another dealer from the district said, ?Although we have brought this to the notice of the district petroleum association and higher authorities, no steps have yet been taken.?

 He said on approaching the district magistrate, he suggested that the oil companies should approach the state government to reduce the burden of taxes.

 Oil industry sources said they have submitted an information report to the government with the necessary details of sales volume reduction. However, the government has not responded yet.

 Posco port in choppy seas

 Baalu: Note of caution

 New Delhi, Dec. 20: Pohang Steel Companys (Posco) Jatadhari port project is in troubled waters as the shipping ministry has warned the facility could lead to an erosion along the coastline and threaten the Paradip harbour.

 Shipping minister T.R. Baalu said in the Lok Sabha today the Orissa government has been asked to undertake intensive and detailed study on the erosion if it decided to develop a minor port for the Korean steel giant. The state government has also been asked to associate the Centre and Paradip port with such studies in future.

 The Centre and the Paradip Port Trust have impressed upon the Orissa government that the port will be in a position to develop its deep-draft dock system after deepening of its channels. This facility can be made available on a captive basis to Posco, the minister said.

 The Jatadhari project could lead to erosion of deposits, which will spell disaster for the Paradip port, the statement said. Senior officials said the ministry was not against Posco opting for a captive port. However, given the sensitivity of the proposed port at Jatadhari, barely 12 km from the Paradip port, the government was compelled to recommend caution.

 The Korean giant is setting up a $12-million-tonne complex in Orissa at a cost of $12 billion, the single-biggest foreign investment ever. The deal, cleared by the Prime Ministers Office, will see Orissa allocating iron ore mines of 600 mt to Posco.

 Posco may export some of the ore it mines but it will have to import an equal amount. It has indicated that Indian ore has high silica content and needs to be bolstered with imported ore. Up to 15 per cent of the ore mined is sought to be exported; under the pact signed with the state, the net exports should be zero.

 Normally, mines are not given up for exports as this is against the Centres policy of not allowing scarce resources to be shipped to foreign shores, while starving domestic firms. The insistence has always been on export of value-added products, not basic raw materials.

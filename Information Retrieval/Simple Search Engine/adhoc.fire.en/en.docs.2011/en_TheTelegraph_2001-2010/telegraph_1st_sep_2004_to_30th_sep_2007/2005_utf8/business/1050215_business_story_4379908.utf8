 New Delhi, Feb. 14: Computer prices are on the skids: entry-level PC prices are expected to go below Rs 10,000 soon.

 The price cuts have already begun with HCL Infosystems slashing the price of its entry-level PC to Rs 12,990. Currently, they are available at Rs 18,000 to Rs 20,000.

 Other companies like HP-Compaq, IBM and Dell said they would like to keep their plans under wraps. But they are unlikely to do so for long.

 Everyone is waiting to see how far they can pare PC prices and are waiting for finance minister P. Chidambaram to announce further duty cuts in the budget for 2005-06 later this month.

 Leading PC makers say there are two factors that are driving prices downwards: first the Information Technology Agreement comes into force by March 1. Under the terms of the agreement, India and other signatories will have to bring down duties on computer hardware to zero; second, the duty cuts will also bring down the prices of the locally made PCs.

 MAIT, the apex body of computer hardware manufacturers, refused to comment on the possible price cuts. However, a spokesperson for the industry forum said it was a trend that would help meet the targets set by the government.

 MAIT executive director Vinnie Mehta said, ?It is good if the prices of PCs come down since it will be in consonance with the objectives of the government to increase PC, Internet and broadband penetration.?

 So, if you have been planning to buy a PC but have been deterred by the prices, the chances are that you will find it will soon suit your wallet.

 HCL today launched a PC EzeeBee Pride at Rs 12,990 that is targeted at first-time users who want to enhance their IT skills. 

 Positioned as a ?value for money? range, EzeeBee is the result of the company?s intense efforts. With a distribution focus on smaller towns as well as the home and small business and home users (SOHO), this new product will be sold in all HCL outlets across the country. 

 Built to boost productivity and improve response time, EzeeBee Pride PC is powered by the 1 gigahertz processor. The multimedia and Internet capable PC comes with the standard one-year warranty and has a 30 giga byte hard disk, 128 MB random access memory (RAM), 15-inch colour monitor, computer disc read only memory (CD-ROM) drive and is backed by a countrywide support network.

 The PC will be ideal for home users and SOHO segments, offering all the functionalities sought by this segment. The PCs also come with optional bundles like the inkjet printer, uninterrupted power supply (UPS), speakers and web cams at an additional cost.

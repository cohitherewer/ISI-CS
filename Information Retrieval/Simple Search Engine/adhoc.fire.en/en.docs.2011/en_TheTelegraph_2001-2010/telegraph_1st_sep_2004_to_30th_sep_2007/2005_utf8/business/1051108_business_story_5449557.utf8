 Hughes centre to offer broadband solutions

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 7: Hughes Systique, a communications software systems development company, will set up a development centre here to provide solutions for wireless broadband communications, terrestrial and satellite applications and emerging 4G wireless products and services. 

 Hughes Systique, which is a subsidiary of Hughes Network Systems, has roped in NextWave Wireless LLC, a wireless broadband development company, and SkyTerra Holdings, Inc. a wholly-owned subsidiary of SkyTerra Communications Inc, to fully finance the project. Incidentally, SkyTerra Communications holds 50 per cent equity in Hughes Network Systems. 

 Hughes Systique is headquartered in Rockville, Maryland, and has its operating unit in Gurgaon.

 The management will be led by Pradeep Kaul, president and CEO and Anil Sharma, executive vice-president. In addition, Pradman Kaul, chairman and CEO of Hughes Network Systems, will serve as the non-executive chairman of the company. 

 Allen Salmasi, chairman and CEO of NextWave Wireless, said I have the deepest admiration for this team and the past successes they have had both in the US and in India. We expect that they will become a major supplier of sophisticated telecommunication systems in a wide range of cutting-edge applications. NextWave expects to take full advantage of their resources as an extension of its internal development resources in the emerging 4G wireless products and services arena. 

 Jeff Leddy, CEO of SkyTerra Communications, said, We believe Hughes Systique will provide an exceptional technology base as an outsourced development centre for telecommunications software systems. We are excited by the opportunity. 

 Kaul said, We are proud to be backed by SkyTerra and NextWave, two well financed, technology promoting companies in the US, with a focus on expanding their presence globally and especially in India. We are ready to play a major role as a developer and exporter of both products and services in the global broadband wireless and wired marketplace. 

 Hughes Systique will also support other application areas such as wireless based networking, RFID enterprise applications and multimedia applications for in-home broadband entertainment networks.

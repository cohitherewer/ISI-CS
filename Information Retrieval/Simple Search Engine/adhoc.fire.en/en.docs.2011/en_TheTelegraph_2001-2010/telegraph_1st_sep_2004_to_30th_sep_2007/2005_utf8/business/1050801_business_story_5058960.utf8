 VW top gun arrives, to meet Reddy today

 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, July 31: Frank Elbe, the former German ambassador who has been roped in by Volkswagen as its India point man, arrived here in the wee hours of this morning to probe Helmuth Schusters swindle in a car project planned at Vizag.

 He was received by a senior bureaucrat of Andhra Pradesh governments protocol department at the airport. This morning, he met industry secretary Lakshmi Parthasarathy but put off talks with others for Monday, when he is expected to meet chief minister Y. S. Rajasekhar Reddy. Officials say Elbe might also hand over a cheque of the two million euros. The state government invested the cash in a dubious outfit, Vashisht Wahan, floated by Schuster.

 He is also likely to visit Vishakapatnam on Tuesday to inspect the 350-acre site where the car project, in which Volkswagen was to pick up 51 per cent, would have come up if everything had gone to the script.

 Elbe, who will be in Andhra for three days, has placed a state government helicopter to ferry him around. On August 4, he will fly to Delhi, where he is slated to meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath.

 This afternoon, he met five to six guests, some of whom were ancillary dealers that Schuster had dealt with. He also spent the day scrutinising some of the documents sent to him by the state government.

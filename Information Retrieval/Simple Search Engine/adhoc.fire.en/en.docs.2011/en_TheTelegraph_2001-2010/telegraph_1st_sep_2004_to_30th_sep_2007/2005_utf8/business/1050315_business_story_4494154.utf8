 Surge in oil import bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 14: Surging international prices have taken the country?s crude import bill to the Rs 85,541-crore mark during April-December, which represents a 41.5 per cent jump over the corresponding figure for the same period last year.

 The value of crude imports during this nine-month period has already shot past Rs 83,528 crore, the amount spent on buying crude during the previous financial year.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today said international crude prices had not come down due to the winter in the West getting prolonged and the delay in the formulation of the economic policy of the US. 

 Addressing the Forum of Financial Writers, Aiyar said he expected the prices to come down during 2005-06 as the winter was now drawing to a close and the new US economic policy would be announced soon. 

 ?International prices are likely to stabilise, making way for a stable domestic fuel pricing policy,? he added.

 The minister said the world oil supply at present is in equilibrium with the demand. 

 There is no economic or political reason that can account for the large increase in international oil prices in 2004. 

 Speculation appears to have played a major role in pushing up crude rates.

 The minister also said exports of petroleum products had gone up to Rs 20,705 crore during April-December, which is 74 per cent higher than the corresponding figure for the same period last fiscal.

 He said the exports were providing an outlet for the excess refining capacity in the country. The national oil companies would go ahead with the new refinery projects and any excess output could be exported, he added. 

 Interestingly, the country has also had to import LPG and kerosene as the domestic refining capacity is not adequate to meet the burgeoning demand. 

 The quantity of these imports during the first nine months is 4.8 per cent less than the amount imported during the same period last year. 

 However, because of skyrocketing international prices, the value of these imports has gone up by over 34 per cent compared with the year-ago period.

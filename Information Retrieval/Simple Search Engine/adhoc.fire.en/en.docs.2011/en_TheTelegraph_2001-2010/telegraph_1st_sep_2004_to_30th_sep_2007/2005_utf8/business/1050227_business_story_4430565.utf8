 Infotech bug finally bites Laloo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 26: Some years ago, Laloo Prasad Yadav made a withering comment about the information technology (IT) wave that was sweeping the country. ?Yeh, IT white-y kya hai??, he asked at an infotech fair at Pragati Maidan.

 Two years later, as the railway minister in the UPA government, Yadav is ready to leap on to the cyber surfboard.

 On Saturday, he rolled out a series of IT-based programmes designed to make it easier for passengers to book their tickets from the comfort of their homes and check the status of their reservations before heading off to board the train. 

 In the process, he expects to generate a bit of additional revenue for the Indian Railways. Presenting the second consecutive Union Railway Budget for 2005-06 in Parliament today, Yadav said the railways would move towards a greater deployment of IT.

 A proposal to develop a management information system through data warehouse developed from the unreserved ticketing system (UTS), passenger reservation system (PRS) and freight operation information system (FOIS) on the Indian railways are some of the new IT initiatives. 

 The railways claims tribunals, goods refund offices and subsidiary claim offices will be fully computerised during 2005-06. The computerisation of goods-refund offices will provide facility of on-line registration of refund cases.

 RailTel, the leading public sector company of railways, will exploit the vast optical fibre network through public-private partnership through joint venture, either through leasing or a channel partner. It will provide various broadband services such as Internet, voice telephony on Internet, cable TV and national long distance telephony in urban as well as rural areas.

 The increase in timing to book tickets through the Internet and over fixed phones is proposed to be started in 2005-06. The facility is now available over mobile phones. The PRS will be extended to 45 locations during the next financial year. It already exists in 1,163 places across the country. 

 A unified crew management system is proposed to be introduced to streamline the management of train crews, optimising manning of trains.

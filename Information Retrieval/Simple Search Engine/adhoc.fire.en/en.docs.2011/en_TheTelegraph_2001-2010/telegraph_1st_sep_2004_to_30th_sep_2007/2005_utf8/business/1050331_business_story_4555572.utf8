 Essar Oil charts retail plan for east

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, March 30: Essar Oil has made a foray into the east for retail transportation of fuel under the Essar brand. It is the first private sector player to commission retail outlets in the Northeast.

 It has set up two outlets in Assam. Later on, Essar Oil plans to set up 20 retail outlets in Bengal, Jharkhand and the northeastern states.

 According to the plan, Essar Oil will have 400 retail outlets in these markets. At present, it is creating the necessary infrastructure to service these markets. 

 Plans are afoot to set up adequate number of depots in each state to cater to the needs of the outlets. In Bengal, a depot is being set up in Haldia.

 Essar Oil has a supply contract with BPCL-owned Numaligarh Refinery to source products.

 Essar?s offtake from both Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd and Numaligarh Refinery is 7,500 KL of petrol and 45,000 KL of diesel. Its pump throughput is about 200 KL per month, which is in line with the industry average.

 Essar Oil managing director A. N. Sinha said, ?This is part of our efforts to have a pan-India presence in marketing petroleum products. We would like to develop the marketing network by the time our refinery goes on stream.?

 Essar Oil is also setting up a 10.5-million-tonne-per-annum capacity refinery at Jamnagar, which will be commissioned in 2006. 

 Till date, Essar Oil has set up over 360 outlets in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. 

 Essar Oil has adopted the franchisee route to develop the marketing network. 

 The cost of setting up a retail outlet varies between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 40 lakh, excluding the cost of the land. It would also set up company-owned outlets in select places.

 As part of its retailing plan, Essar Oil proposes to enroll 2,500 franchisees for outlets in the next couple of years. 

 In line with the approval of the government for retailing petroleum products, Essar Oil will set up about 12 proposed outlets in the remote and low-service areas.

 Essar Oil has tied up with Castrol India for supply of lubricants in the west. It is tying up with other reputed lubricant manufacturers in other parts of the country as well.

 Essar outlets will also offer, besides petrol, diesel and lubricants, other products and services. These will include fast food, dhabas, ATM and cyber cafe.

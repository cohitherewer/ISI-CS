 Mittal: Homing in

 Ranchi, June 6: Steel tycoon Laxmi Niwas Mittal is moving fast on his first proposed Indian investment, now estimated at over Rs 40,000 crore, in a plant in Jharkhand with a capacity of 10 million tonnes.

 Mittals XI, a team of executives from his worldwide steel empire, arrived here today, to push forward talks initiated last month with the Jharkhand government.

 S. K. Satpathy, industry secretary, said: The Mittals are interested in investing over Rs 40,000 crore in the state. They want to set up a 10 -million-tonne (MT) steel plant and carry out iron ore mining. 

 During its week-long stay, the team ? nine from abroad and two from India ? will prepare a feasibility report identifying the iron ore reserves the company will tap after consulting senior government officials.

 Three or four more officials are likely to join us soon. We will stay here for a week or so and will submit our reports within 10 days, said Mittal Steel mining director M. P. Singh told The Telegraph.

 On reaching Ranchi, the team members first held an internal meeting and then headed for Nepal House for discussions with the secretaries of industry and mines and geology departments. They were scheduled to meet the chief secretary P. P. Sharma in the evening.

 The group informed us about the style of functioning of the company and sought information related to mining and industries in the state. We have already constituted a team comprising officials of key departments, who will arrange the teams meetings with the state machinery. If they want to visit the spots, we will make the necessary arrangements, said A. K. Singh, mines and geology secretary.

 Satpathy said Mittal Steel officials have shortlisted some places for the plant and would visit those sites.

 Our team has two steelmaking experts from the US and two from the UK, two mining experts from Australia and one from Kazakhstan, costing and logistic experts from Romania and legal, financial and infrastructure development consultants from India, M. P. Singh said. 

 The experts will prepare several reports on iron ore mining, steelmaking, financial requirements and infrastructure.

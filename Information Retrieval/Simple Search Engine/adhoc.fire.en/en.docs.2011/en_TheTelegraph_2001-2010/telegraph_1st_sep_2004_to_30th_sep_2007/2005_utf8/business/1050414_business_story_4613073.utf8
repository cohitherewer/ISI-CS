 Guwahati, April 13: AirTel is likely to invest about Rs 4,500 crore to launch 3G services in the country.

 ?We are ready with the network for 3G,? said Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman and managing director of the Bharti group. ?The day the government releases the spectrum, the service can be launched within a few months. I feel the 3G service will be available in the next 18 months for subscribers in India.? 

 3G is a generic term used for the next generation of mobile communications systems. It is a service that allows high-speed streaming downloads on mobile phones, enabling a user to watch video and movie clips, a live cricket match and even trade on the stock market using real-time price information.

 AirTel is bullish about the prospects for 3G usage in India and is confident about the higher revenue generation capacity. 

 Cellular players have spoken about launching 3G services in India, which has been launched in Europe recently and has still to establish commercial viability. Much depends on the release of spectrum ? or radio waves ? which is a precious source that the government allocates very sparingly for civilian use.

 Cellular players like Bharti have been allocated 12 Mhz of spectrum in the metros and will need to increase it to about 20 Mhz to be in a position to offer viable 3G services.

 The analog networks defined the first generation of mobile phones that were launched in the country in 1995. The second generation was defined by the move to digital networks. Third generation (3G) wireless is defined by the migration to packet-switched networks at high-speed data rates. 

 Sample this: the latest 3G enabled mobile phone (from LG) available in India can offer a speed of 384 kilo bits per second (kbps) that will allow streaming videos and the download of a three-hour movie in 20 to 30 minutes over these mobiles.

 Currently, in India, the maximum speed that is offered by mobile operators is 177 kbps using the Enhanced Data Rate for Global Evolution (EDGE) technology.

 ?There is a need for content developers who can fuel the needs of 3G application. We do not see ourselves in the content development business. But those who want to will be able to get good business. Even today, a few developers are preparing content for 3G services,? said Mittal. 

 Mittal also highlighted the fact that 3G services will get a boost with a fall in mobile handset prices. 

 ?The sluggish attitude from both operators and subscribers in adopting 3G-based services is due to regulatory and hardware costs. But this will change in the next 12 to 18 months. The handset cost of Blackberry and its services will drop. I cannot wait for long to cut the prices of Blackberry services, it has to happen soon,? Mittal said.

 In India, 3G is embroiled in a controversy between two technologies ? the code division multiple access (CDMA) and global system for mobile communications (GSM). The first is championed by Reliance Infocomm and the second by AirTel and Hutch. 

 The champions of the CDMA technology claim that the new band can utilise spectrum more efficiently and is a natural path for migration to 3G services.

 Calcutta, Nov. 4: Jai Balaji Sponge Iron has been allocated a coal mine that will cut down dependence on the market and bring down cost sharply.

 The mine, located at Bundi in Jharkhand, has a reserve of 34 million tonnes. 

 The ministry of coal has offered this mine to Jai Balaji along with another company. The leading sponge iron producer in Bengal will get about 8 million tonnes from the reserve.

 Aditya Jajodia, chairman and managing director of Jai Balaji Group, said the reserves would suffice its captive consumption for the next 30 years at the present level of production.

 The sponge iron making capacity of the company now stands at 1.05 lakh tonnes with an 18-mw power plant.

 Jai Balaji?s plant is located at Mangalpur near Ranigunj. The mine is well connected by rail and road.

 The production from the mine will start in two years from now. However, the company has to draw up a mining development plan now.

 Jajodia said the development cost would be around Rs 40-50 crore and that would be borne by the two companies. 

 Jai Balaji?s captive consumption at the present level of production is 2.5 lakh tonnes per annum.

 The company pays about Rs 1,500-1,600 per tonne to procure coal. It has links with Coal India for the same.

 Once the captive mine comes into production, the cost per tonne would go down by 50 per cent to Rs 700-800 per tonne.

 ?We will have a substantial savings due to a captive mine,? Jajodia said.

 In a notice sent to the stock exchange, Ramrupai Balaji Steels, another group company, has informed that it has also been allotted a coal mine in the Ardhagram area.

 Ramrupai is the largest producer of sponge iron with a capacity of 1.2 lakh tonnes.

 For the second quarter ended September 30, Jai Balaji has reported a 29 per cent growth in total revenue at Rs 115.69 crore, while the net profit was Rs 6.47 crore, a jump of 84 per cent over same period last fiscal. With the commissioning of the new power plant, there will be substantial savings leading to a stronger bottomline.

 Earlier this year, the Jai Balaji Group had tapped the capital market with an initial public offering (IPO) of Ramrupai Balaji Steels. 

 The IPO was made to part finance an integrated steel plant in Durgapur. Ramrupai Balaji Steels had already commissioned part of the project comprising a sponge iron, pig iron and rolling mill. It planned to set up a steel melting shop with billets caster, a coal washery and a captive power plant.

 Calcutta, Sept. 23: The stiff qualification norms laid down by West Bengal Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (Hidco) for developing the largest-ever housing complex in New Town, Rajarhat, have irked local builders. They feel none of the local developers can meet the norms.

 Hidco has sought expressions of interest (EoI) for setting up 20,000 dwelling units on 150 acres. The tender documents for what could be a Rs 1,000-crore project will be sold from today.

 According to the qualification norms laid down by Hidco, the bidder must have an annual turnover of Rs 200 crore. However, preference will be given to those having a higher turnover consistently for the last four years.

 The bidder must have net worth not less that Rs 100 crore, but preference will be given to those with higher net worth consistently for the last four years.

 Moreover, the bidder or the consortium of builders is required to construct 1 million sq ft of commercial/residential properties in the last four years. However, preferences will be given to the company, which has more construction to its credit in India.

 The criteria would leave all local outsiders out of the consideration, Santosh Rungta, a prominent builder and the co-chairman of the Real Estate Committee, Ficci eastern region, said. He was speaking on the sidelines of a meet on the real estate sector organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), which was also attended by Ficci eastern region chairman C.K. Dhanuka and Bengal housing minister Gautam Dev.

 Calcutta, Nov. 8: State-owned Exim Bank will, for the first time, tap the Japanese bond market raising close to yen-equivalent of $200-250 million.

 The bank will launch Samurai bonds in the next few months. It has already received the go-ahead signal from Reserve Bank of India, Exim Bank chairman and managing director, T. C. Venkat Subramanian said.

 The bonds issue is part of the banks $350-million fund raising programme for supporting its various projects.

 The yen-denominated Samurai bonds would then be swapped with dollars to save on interest costs. This way, we can raise funds which are cheaper by at least 50 basis points, Subramanian clarified.

 Interest rates in Japan are cheaper by at least 50 basis points compared with those in the US. Other associated costs are also lower in Japan.

 The Exim Bank move is expected to pave the way for other companies to test waters in the Japanese bond market more often. We are expanding the market as well, Subramanian pointed out.

 Speaking at the sidelines of the Exim Summit, organised by the eastern region chapter of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in Calcutta on Tuesday, Subramanian informed that the money would be spent on offering more lines of credit, financing of imports and overseas acquisitions.

 Subramanian said the bank was keen to finance overseas acquisitions, for which it has set aside Rs 250 crore for the current year. Last fiscal, the bank provided Rs 180 crore under the head. Till date, the bank had financed 12 overseas take-overs.

 He informed that the bank has been toying with six proposals at this moment.

 According to the Exim Bank CMD, the bank is keen to participate in equity in overseas ventures. This year, six new proposals were on the board at various stages, he said.

 Exim Bank had earmarked Rs 8,000 crore borrowings from the market during the current financial year. Till now, 50 per cent of the target has been raised. Half of the total money to be raised will be in dollars.

 Subramanian said the banks total disbursement target has also been revised from Rs 13,000 crore in the previous fiscal to Rs 15,000 crore in the current year and the bank would continue to focus on the small and medium enterprise sector in the country.

 Meanwhile, the government has agreed to jack up the banks paid-up equity capital from Rs 850 crore to Rs 1,050 crore.

 Vietnamese ties

 Vietnam has sought greater ties with India and Bengal, in particular. Tran Trong Khanh, ambassador of Vietnam, who was in the summit rooted for a direct flight between Calcutta and Ho Chi Minh City. He also invited chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee ? also present at the meeting ? to that country. Bhattacharjee reciprocated with a promise to go there at the earliest and asked CII to do the spadework for fruitful business meetings there.

 Fuel hike options on PM table

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Tripathi: Number game

 New Delhi, Aug. 16: Petroleum secretary S.C. Tripathi and officials of the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) today discussed various options of raising petroleum prices. These will be put up before Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who will take the final decision.

 The discussions followed indications from petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar in the Lok Sabha that the government was considering a fuel price hike.

 We are going through one of the worst crises in international oil prices. We believe in equitable burden sharing. A little bit by the consumer, a substantial chunk by the government and a larger share on the shoulders of the oil companies, Aiyar said.

 Various combinations and permutations ? scaling down taxes to shore up bleeding oil companies was one of them ? were presented to the PMO team headed by T.K.A. Nair, principal secretary to the Prime Minister. 

 Nair will brief Singh on what can be done to come out of the predicament, given the fact that finance minister P. Chidambaram has been reluctant to change the distorted oil tax structure. The petroleum ministry expects the Prime Minister to intervene in the matter and save oil companies before they turn sick.

 Presenting his case in the Lok Sabha, Aiyar said oil prices have shot up $18 per barrel in the past 14 months. This is equivalent to the increase in eight years, from 1996 to 2004. The NDA was in power for most of these years. 

 The effort at the PMO huddle was to strike a balance between consumers interest, saving oil firms from bankruptcy and keeping fiscal deficit in leash.

 While a hike is inevitable, its timing is uncertain. The government, ideally, wants to address the issue once the monsoon session of Parliament is out of its way. 

 While the petroleum ministry has forwarded its case for a hike of Rs 3.25 per litre in petrol and Rs 4 in diesel, the government is unlikely to endorse such a sharp increase. Oil companies are also losing Rs 92 per LPG cylinder and Rs 11 per litre on kerosene, whose price has been frozen since March 2002. Cooking gas was made moderately dearer in November last year.

 Aiyar pointed out in Parliament that the government had, so far, resorted to modest increases with oil firms taking on much of the burden. 

 Over the past three years, the price rise has been 164 per cent for crude, 177 per cent for petrol, 203 per cent for diesel, 218 per cent for kerosene and 108 per cent for LPG.

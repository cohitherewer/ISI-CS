 New Delhi, Aug. 26: Public sector oil companies have drawn up ambitious plans to invest a staggering Rs 63,348 crore in the downstream refining and petrochemicals businesses in the next five years.

 Unveiling the plans at the parliamentary consultative committee meeting, petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said Rs 24,472 crore of this had been allocated for setting up new refineries, while Rs 10,763 crore would be invested for expansion and modernisation of the existing facilities. 

 Investments for mandated auto fuel facilities to meet the latest emission norms would absorb as much as Rs 14,400 crore. 

 Another Rs 11,046 crore is earmarked by the oil companies for diversifying into the petrochemicals sector, which is currently dominated by Reliance Industries after it took over IPCL.

 Intelligent software on cards

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, Feb. 9: The Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (Acma) is in talks with Wipro, Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) to develop intelligent software for automobiles.

 ?Given India?s strength in software development, Acma has taken an initiative to bring leading auto component manufacturers and software companies together to develop systems for vehicles made at home and abroad,? said Acma president Deep Kapuria.

 Leading automakers in developed countries are increasingly using artificial intelligence in their vehicles for engine management, transmission and navigation systems.

 Other areas where software-based intelligent control can be exercised are efficiency in fuel emission, pollution control and mirror adjustments.

 Kapuria said, ?Technology is driven by three key factors ? legislation, consumer demand and industry. Today, the consumer is looking for value added services and information-based entertainment. Car users now want to access the Internet, news and also entertainment through DVD while travelling.?

 ?The industry is looking at cost-cutting measures and value-added services. To achieve these objectives, it is necessary to bring about integration in the mechanical and electronics aspects.? 

 All software majors are working on developing software for the auto sector.

 Wipro has worked on incorporating a traffic information system, which enables a car user to send a request on a GSM network for news on traffic conditions on specific routes. Infosys offers solutions in embedded software and hardware services, which include communication protocols and safety critical software testing and validation.

 ?We will provide the domain expertise and outline the requirements, while the development will be done by the software companies,? said Kapuria. ?Our members are already in talks to bring about a synergy. Later on, the implementation will take place on an organisation level. Developing the software is not an issue. We have to capture the need and develop products to meet that requirement.?

 Acma is also conducting a number of specialised programmes to make the auto component manufacturers internationally competitive. These are being organised by the Acma Centre for Technology.

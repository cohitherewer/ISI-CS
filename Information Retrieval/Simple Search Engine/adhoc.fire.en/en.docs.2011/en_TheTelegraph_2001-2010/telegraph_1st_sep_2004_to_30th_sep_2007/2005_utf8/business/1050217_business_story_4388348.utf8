 Tata Metaliks focus on west

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL AND SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Feb. 16: Tata Metaliks is keen on exploring inorganic growth opportunities to increase its presence in the western region.

 The company is on the lookout for possible acquisitions and has appointed merchant bankers to conduct the required valuations.

 Sources said the company had almost finalised a deal. However, due to some discrepancies in the negotiations, the promoters of the other firm pulled out of the contract.

 The company plans to increase its production capacity to half-a-million tonnes of pig iron per annum with the acquisition. This will make it the largest pig iron producer in the world.

 Tata Metaliks has recently set up its second mini blast furnace at its Kharagpur factory with an installed capacity of 1.63 lakh tonnes ? the same as the first one. It will be operational from February 26. The total manufacturing capacity of the company would then be 3.26 lakh tonnes per annum.

 The company sources its entire iron ore requirement from its group firm ? Tata Iron and Steel Company. The contract is of a continuous nature but the negotiations are carried out every year.

 BHP Billiton supplies 50 per cent of the company?s requirement of coking coal, where the contract is annual and negotiated in July every year. The balance requirement is again sourced from Tata Iron and Steel.

 The official said the coking coal prices would not go up beyond the current price band in 2005. It expects the new coking coal contracts for supply in 2005 would be fixed in the range of $125-130 per tonne. It does not rule out the possibility of paying marginally higher than the present rate when the contract is negotiated in July 2005. However, beyond that the prices are expected to come down.

 The foundry grade pig iron prices tend to move with scrap and coke prices and should be in alignment with international prices, said an official.

 For the nine months ended December 31, total sales of the company was 1.2 lakh tonnes, a growth of 23 per cent compared with 97,695 tonnes in the corresponding period last year. For the third quarter, the sales were around 43,000 tonnes compared with 33,000 tonnes in the year-ago period, a growth of around 31 per cent.

 The shares of the company closed today at Rs 183 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, down 2.19 per cent from yesterday?s close of Rs 187.10. The scrip touched its 52-week high at Rs 197.40 on February 10.

 Yet another rating pat for Reliance

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 23: Reliance Industries Ltd has got thumbs up from the two leading global credit rating agencies ? Moodys and Standard and Poors.

 After Moodys Investors Services, Standard amp; Poors Ratings Services today patted Reliance Industries Ltd.

 It has upgraded Reliances long-term foreign and local currency bonds ratings to BBB from BB+ with a stable outlook. 

 S amp;P said the upgrade reflected Reliances competitive position in refining and petrochemicals, its divestment of capital-intensive non-core telecom and power businesses, and an overall moderate financial profile. The rating has also factored in the demerger of the Reliance business, which was approved by shareholders. 

 According to S amp;P, although there was no cash outflow from Reliance due to the demerger, the timely completion and continuity of the arrangement was critical for the outlook and ratings.

 With a prominent share of exports, high degree of integration with the international capital markets, and positive free cash flow, Reliance meets Standard amp; Poors revised criteria for assigning non-sovereign issuers foreign-currency ratings higher than those of the sovereign, which in this case is India (BB+/Stable/B). Reliance is also expected to retain these attributes under stress conditions like adverse currency movements, the rating agency added.

 Credit analyst Anshukant Taneja, however, cautioned that the ratings are constrained by Reliances exposure to highly cyclical industries, large capital commitments in refining, exploration and production businesses, and uncertainties in developing its reportedly large gas reserves.

 S amp;P also took into account Reliances Rs 61,700-crore capital expenditure plan, given the potential softening of the petrochemical cycle, reduced demand for refined petroleum products, and uncertainties related to its upstream gas business.

 Lower-than-expected cash flows for funding a part of the capital expenditure could mean still higher borrowings, which would weaken the companys credit protection measures, Taneja said. However, the petrochemical firms fiscal position, strong liquidity and access to financial resources did mitigate some of these risks, he added. 

 Last week, Moodys had upgraded Reliances foreign currency bonds rating to Baa3 from Ba2 and assigned a local currency issuer rating of Baa3. The agency had also indicated that if the demerger plan goes through by April, both ratings could also be upgraded to Baa2.

 Moodys said its move to upgrade the ratings on Reliance was prompted by the companys continued strong operational and financial profiles. Its fiscal position was supported by the dominant market position in refining and petrochemicals, the benefits of economies of scale, low-cost integrated operations, strong level of domestic demand and a favourable outlook for the petrochemicals industry in the next 12-18 months.

 Govt gears up to get pension bill going

 Swarup: Sizing up the odds

 New Delhi, May 16: After making a valiant stab at banking sector reforms last week, the government is now gearing up to wrestle with the more contentious pension reforms that have been stalled for over a year.

 Talks on pension reforms will take centre-stage tomorrow, when finance ministry officials make a presentation before the parliamentary standing committee on finance. This will be followed by a discussion on various aspects of the Pension Funds Regulatory Development Authority (PFRDA) Bill.

 Yes, we are scheduled to meet members of the standing committee on finance tomorrow. We will examine the provisions of the bill, essentially the importance of the new pension system (NPS), quot; D. Swarup, chairman of the interim PFRDA, told The Telegraph.

 He, however, declined to specify which provisions were likely to be hotly debated.

 CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta, who is a member of the committee, said, This is the first time that such a meeting is being held. I will, however, oppose the pension bill. Our intention is to keep the present system.

 The new pension system proposes a defined contribution by the employer (like the central government for instance) and the employee. The system has already been introduced for central government employees who joined service after January 1, 2004.

 The squabble over the new pension system stems from a proposal to allow private pension funds to manage the corpus by investing a part of it in the stock market. 

 At present, the neophytes in the government system are receiving an 8 per cent interest on their pension fund contributions. Once the pension fund managers are in place, they will receive market-based returns.

 Dasgupta said, Its true that liabilities of the Centre and states in meeting pension bills are soaring; but in a country where there is no social security system, the government cannot ignore its responsibilities towards its employees.

 Since the new system was initiated, the Left parties have opposed the move on the ground that there should be an assured or guaranteed returns for employees.

 However, the PFRDA maintains that in the longer run, the new system will be able to deliver higher returns as the funds can be invested in equity.

 Swarup had earlier made it clear that he had an open mind on the investment norms of the pension fund.

 After meeting stiff opposition from Left parties, the PFRDA bill, which was introduced in the Lower House of the Parliament a couple of weeks ago, was referred to the standing committee on finance.

 The finance ministry has also asked the committee to give its recommendations on the bill in the monsoon session.

 In the wake of soaring pension liabilities of both the Centre and states, tomorrows meeting is likely to see the PFRDA explaining the benefits of moving from a defined benefit to a defined contribution system and the need for pension reforms, said sources.

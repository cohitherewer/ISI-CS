The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

Taxpayers free to invest anytime, anywhere

Buffet Delight / Dhirendra Kumar

In a decade or so of budget watching, this is the 

first time I find myself honestly able to say that there have been real reforms 

in the way the government encourages savings. This morning, P. Chidambaram has 

set free those Indians who save. Till now, the government told you how much you 

could invest in what kind of assets if you wanted tax breaks. Now, savers are 

free to make their own decisions. 

You will now have a pool of Rs 1 lakh (itself much 

larger than the earlier limit that was Rs 60,000) which you are free to put into 

insurance, PPF, mutual funds or a host of other investment avenues in whatever 

mix you like. You are free to invest as much or as little in any type of investment 

that you want. If you believe in equity, you can put the entire one lakh in an 

equity mutual fund. If you like safety, you can deposit the whole amount in PPF. 

And so on.

This is wonderful because it treats taxpayers as adults 

who can take their own investment decisions. It is also realistic because, for 

the first time, India?s tax-rebate rules seem to recognise that every tax-payer 

is different and what is a good choice for one may be a bad one for someone else. 

An unmarried twenty-something call-center worker whose 

parents can support themselves comfortably has very different financial needs 

from a middle-aged village school teacher who has children to educate and a large 

clan to support. Till now, the government forced both of them to invest in different 

asset classes in the same ratio. Now, each can invest in whatever is best suited 

for his or her own situation.

However, freedom always comes with responsibility. 

The fact that savers are free to make their own choices means that they can make 

the right choices or they can make the wrong choices. It also means that everyone 

who saves will have to spend some time and give a little thought to what their 

investment needs are, and what kind of risk they should or should not take. Investments 

of this kind are normally made for a very long period of time and over such periods, 

the effects of bad investment decisions can extract a large penalty. 

Till now, it was the government that was making bad 

investment decisions for most of us. From now on, we?ll have no one to blame but 

ourselves. 

This new freedom makes it imperative that investors 

educate themselves and also puts additional responsibility on the media to educate 

people. It also places additional responsibility upon the government to ensure 

honesty and transparency in the marketing and sales of savings instruments. Freedom 

of choice for investors should not mean the freedom to be led astray by crafty, 

emotionally charged advertising. 

For example, the real situation on the ground is that 

while investment instruments like mutual funds and various fixed income avenues 

are tightly regulated, insurance companies are aggressively pitching lucrative 

investment-disguised-as-insurance schemes to a market that is simply not sophisticated 

enough to understand what is being sold. 

Now that Mr. Chidambaram has given the populace the 

freedom to make their own choices, he also needs to make sure that no one is able 

to dedicate massive marketing budgets to brainwashing people into making investment 

choices that are good for sellers but bad for the buyers.

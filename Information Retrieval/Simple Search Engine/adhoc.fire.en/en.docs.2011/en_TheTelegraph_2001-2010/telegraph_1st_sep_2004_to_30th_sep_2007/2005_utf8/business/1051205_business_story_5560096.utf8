 Wage-dues hump on Dunlop revival road

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Gate to a new future

 Sahagunj, Dec. 4: Pawan Ruia didnt have to pay what Lalit Suri had to a few days ago. When he walked into Dunlops Sahagunj factory today, Ruia got a heros welcome, unlike Suri, who waded through a slogan-chanting throng of unhappy workers at Great Eastern Hotel on Thursday.

 Like Suri took the challenge to turn around Great Eastern, the oldest hotel in the country, Ruia has taken upon himself the task of restarting Dunlop, Indias oldest tyre maker. 

 However, Ruia will not have a cakewalk. For Great Eastern, the Bengal government will pay workers dues and give Suri a clean slate to work on. Ruia would have to negotiate with a 2700-strong army of employees at Sahagunj. 

 As the initial euphoria of Suri entering the portals of Great Eastern fades, workers are getting back to work. By contrast, representatives of Citu and Intuc at Dunlop have demanded that Ruia first clear workers dues before thinking of a restart. The unions estimate the arrears at Rs 35 crore. The wage component comprises the biggest chunk, of Rs 19 crore, while the gratuity, medical bill and others add up the remaining Rs 16 crore.

 However, Ruia didnt commit anything today. I have to check the details, I cant say anything now, he said. However, he held out the hope that the Sahagunj unit could get going a year earlier. Seeing the enthusiasm among workers, I feel the work can resume earlier than I presumed, Ruia said to the cheering crowd that surged into the factory after seeing his convoy of 13 cars drive in. 

 Ruia had said Dunlops Ambattur unit in Tamil Nadu would start in three months. It will take less than a year at Sahagunj, where plant and machinery are in poor shape and where negotiations with workers will take longer.

 During his meetings with the unions today, Ruia suggested that the plant could be started in a phased manner and existing workers re-deployed in a way that suits the plan. He sought suggestions on divisions of the unit where operations could be started first. The unions had no ready answer, but said they would get back soon.

 The Sahagunj factory has 2,700 workers on its rolls. Ruia said no more than 1000-1200 would be required to resume work. There are about 1,100 workers at Ambattur. He has sought the cooperation of the state to reach an amicable solution with workers.

 MRPL ships first lot of Euro-III diesel

 A STAFF REPORTER

 AIMING HIGH

 Calcutta, Jan. 2: Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) despatched the first consignment of 10,000 kilolitres of Euro-III high-speed-diesel on December 31.

 A. K. Balyan, director (HR and business development) of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), which holds a majority stake in MRPL, announced this at the Petrotech roadshow here today. The diesel is required to meet the April 1 deadline for the introduction of fuel conforming to Euro-III emission norms in 11 cities. 

 MRPL has a production capacity of around 1 lakh metric tonnes of Euro-III compliant diesel with the rest of the production conforming to BS-II.

 After meeting Bangalore?s requirement of about 30 thousand metric tonnes (TMT) per month, MRPL is in a position to supply the product to other destinations.

 Meanwhile, ONGCs proposed gas-based power plant in Tripura would be ready for generation and evacuation in the next three years.

 Balyan said the power plant had been identified as a fast-track project by the corporation, adding that an MoU had been already signed with Power Trading Corporation for evacuation of power.

 Balyan said the tariff for power generated at the Tripura plant would be benchmarked against the industry rates and the estimated price would be around Rs 2.50 per unit.

 Meanwhile, the Tripura government has already formed a joint venture with Tripura State Power Development Corporation. A special purpose vehicle would be created with ONGCs participation.

 Balyan said the estimated cost for the 1000-MW power plant would be around Rs 3500 crore.

 He said once the network covering a stretch of 200 kilometres in the northeast was completed by Power Grid Corporation, power generated at the plant would be wheeled from Tripura to Rajashthan.

 Petrotech 2005, a major international event held every two years on developments in the hydrocarbon sector, would showcase the recent advancements made in this area with more than 200 foreign delegates already confirming their participation in the five-day exhibition.

 Balyan, who is also the chairman of the organising committee of Petrotech 2005, said nearly 3500 delegates were expected to attend the event starting January 15 in New Delhi.

 He said special delegations would come on invitation from Russia and Romania to discuss possible areas of participation in upstream and downstream areas. ONGC expects around 200 foreign delegates at the meet.

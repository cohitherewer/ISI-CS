 Sebi snubbed on UBS ban

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Back in the game

 Mumbai, Sept. 9: The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) today set aside the ban on UBS Securities over the May 17, 2004 market crash, saying the FII had not done anything to ?endanger the interest of investors and the market?.

 Sebi had barred the Swiss investment bank from Indian bourses for a year, an order that was squashed like several previous decrees aimed at reining in market spoilsports.

 ?We do not find any reason to uphold the orders under Section 11 B and Section 11 (4) of the Sebi Act. We set aside the impugned order and uphold the appeal on basis of the fact and circumstances of the case,? the tribunal said.

 The order was delivered by a two-member bench after presiding officer R. Rajaratnam excused himself from the case in July. The exit followed the rejection by Sebi of his suggestion for an amicable settlement with UBS. He was miffed the regulator had done so through the media.

 ?Sebi is free to take any action if it so desires and if there is a prima facie case under any of the provisions of the Sebi Act, 1992 and the FII regulations,? the tribunal said.

 The tribunal said Section 11 (4) and 11 B, which gives unrestricted powers to Sebi to intervene for orderly functioning of the market, is meant to safeguard market, ?not to penalise offenders for any violation?.

 ?In the order issued one year after the event (crash), we do not find that the appellant (UBS) did anything which endangers investors or the orderly development of securities market,? SAT said, adding there was no emergency situation. The market meltdown took place on May 17, 2004 and the Sebi order was issued a year later.

 The tribunal said Sebi?s order spoke of delays and non-furnishing of information on part of UBS Securities, a lapse it felt could have been more appropriately dealt with under Section 15 of the Sebi Act. 

 UBS Securities Asia and its associates were stopped from issuing off-shore derivative instruments with underlying Indian securities for a year. The firm was a big investor in the cash and derivatives segments in May 2004.

 It was suspected that the steep market fall on May 17 last year could have been triggered as a result of the way UBS accentuated the selling pressure in specific stocks.

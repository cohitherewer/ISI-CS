 Bata pulls up socks, mulls VRS

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New steps

 Mumbai, March 12: Footwear major Bata India has drawn up a seven-point agenda to build on the opportunities in the market and improve its performance. Led by a desire to control costs, the company is now looking at global sourcing and is also mulling a new voluntary retirement scheme (VRS) in 2005.

 The VRS will reduce the companys employee cost in the medium term, while the global sourcing of raw materials will increase its net realisation.

 In an offer document filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for its forthcoming rights issue, Bata India said it is now looking forward to a tax-free manufacturing zone in the country. 

 At present, outsourced goods are routed through contract manufacturers in Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal, which offer concessions in excise, sales tax and corporate tax. 

 Bata India is now negotiating with third party manufacturing facilities in two other tax-free states of Assam and Jammu and Kashmir, a move which is expected to improve its margins.

 The company, which suffered a net loss of Rs 40.46 crore for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, said it has a large workforce which results in high employee costs. Therefore, reducing employee costs and restructuring and streamlining its operations is the major challenge and risk, it said. 

 ?As part of the rationalisation of work practices, processes and modernisation, the company has offered VRS to its employees. Around 1520 people accepted the VRS last year. The company plans to introduce a new scheme in 2005. The VRS is expected to reduce employee cost in the medium term,? it added.

 Bata India is planning to come out with a rights issue of 1.29 crore shares in a price band of Rs 45-54 in the ratio of one equity share for every four held. 

 The rights issue will meet the working capital needs and renovation and modernisation of Bata?s retail stores. 

 The parent now holds 51 per cent of the companys equity. Bata India said the promoters have decided to subscribe to the full extent of their rights entitlement in the issue.

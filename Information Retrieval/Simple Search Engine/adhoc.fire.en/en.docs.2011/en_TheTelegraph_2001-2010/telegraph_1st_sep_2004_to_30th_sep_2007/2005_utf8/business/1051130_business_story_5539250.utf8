 Auto lube sellers eye new users

 Mumbai, Nov. 29: Faced with tepid growth rates, automotive lubricant manufacturers are falling back on first-time users of automobiles to rev up their numbers.

 The optimism doing the rounds is that an addition of nearly 50 million new consumers (including two-wheeler owners) over the next five years will spur the growth rate. The automotive lubricant industry is at present growing at a meagre 1.5 per cent.

 The lube makers are in the meantime pushing sales through product launches, enhanced service offerings and high decibel campaigns to capture the consumers attention.

 The growth rate of retail automotive lubes has slipped to a single digit recently due to technological advancements in the automobile industry leading to relatively less use of lubricants. 

 What have made the going tougher for automotive lube manufacturers are the cut-throat competition on the one hand and a firm base oil price on the other. The key players in this segment include Castrol India Ltd, Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation.

 Sudhanshu Vats, vice-president (marketing), Castrol India Ltd, said: While an old generation truck used 160 litres of lubes per annum, a new generation truck would use 110 litres annually to run the same mileage.

 Castrol India posted a 10 per cent rise in sales for the third quarter ended September 30. The company had earlier initiated a major re-branding exercise which included a new logo and a liquid engineering theme for its products. Apart from a revamped packaging, the company is also planning to launch strong marketing programmes for the rest of this fiscal to maintain the growth momentum.

 Vats said while the industry has been growing at 1.5 per cent, Castrol registered more than 5 per cent.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 31: United Phosphorus Ltd (UPL) will acquire Reposo S.I.I.C (Reposo) of Buenos Aires, Argentina in an all-cash deal of $11 million (Rs 49.6 crore). Reposo is a manufacturer and distributor of crop protection products.

 The deal includes all stocks and assets of Reposo, its product registrations, manufacturing site and all other property rights associated with the company. The acquisition is effective from October 31. The generic agrochemical company will fund it through its cash accruals.

 According to UPL, the acquisition will provide it with a strong platform to expand and strengthen its presence in Latin America ? one of the fastest growing agrochemical regions in the world. The acquisition is in line with UPLs strategy to increase its business both through acquisitions and organically.

 This is UPLs third acquisition this year following its takeover of Cequisa, a Spanish agrochemical company with 400 registrations worldwide and sales of 19.3 million euro. For the year ended June 30, Reposos revenues were $12.5 million.

 In June, UPL announced its acquisition of a 100 per cent stake in SWAL Corporation Ltd, formerly known as Shaw Wallace Agrochemicals Ltd, for a consideration of Rs 23.4 crore.

 SWAL is the oldest agrochemical player in India with revenues of over Rs 70 crore. The acquisition enabled UPL to have greater access in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil Nadu. SWAL manufactures, formulates and markets agrochemicals and fertiliser mixtures and its plant is located in Haldia

 In November last year, UPL also acquired Agvalue in the US that made it the fourth acquisition in the past one year.

 Apart from this acquisition, it also bought the Aciflourofen compound from BASF of Germany and the Oryzalin herbicide business of Dow AgroSciences.

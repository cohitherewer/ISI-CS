 New Delhi, Jan. 2: Coal production grew 6.7 per cent to touch 346.06 million tonnes during the January to November period.

 According to an official release, coal production has crossed its target of 324.44 million tonnes.

 Total dispatches during this period also crossed its target to reach 345.25 million tonnes against the projected 329.06 million tonnes.

 Coal India Limited (CIL) is the largest coal producing organisation, with an authorised share capital of Rs 8,904.18 crore in March 2003.

 CIL and its subsidiaries collectively achieved a pre-tax profit of Rs 4,889.16 crore last year against Rs 2,865.50 crore in 2002-03.

 To facilitate power production in the country, the coal ministry has allotted Pakri Barwadih Coal block to National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) to undertake coal mining for exclusive use in their power plants.

 ?The ministry for the first time decided to allow a private sector company to engage in mining and disposal of coal from Goititoria (east and west) coal blocks as non-captive small and isolated deposits,? a press release said.

 The decision has been taken considering that small pockets of coal deposits cannot be mined scientifically and investment on infrastructure for proper mining may not be economically viable.

 For the period January to November 2004, state-owned coal production touched 313.08 million tonnes against a target of 3.5.08 million tonnes. 

 The government has declared Neyveli Lignite Corporation Limited (NLC) as a mini ratna enterprise (category-I) in August this year.

 At present, NLC is operating three open cast lignite mines of a total capacity of 24 million tonnes, and also three thermal power stations.

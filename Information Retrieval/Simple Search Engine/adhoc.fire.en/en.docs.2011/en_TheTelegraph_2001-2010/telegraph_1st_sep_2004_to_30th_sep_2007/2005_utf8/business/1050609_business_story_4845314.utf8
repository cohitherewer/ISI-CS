 Shanghai/Hong Kong, June 8 (Reuters): Chinas Lenovo Group, the worlds third-largest PC maker, reported an unexpected drop in quarterly profit on Wednesday, as it looked to its newly acquired IBM PC unit to restart growth.

 Lenovo shares fell on the 12 per cent profit decline, closing down 3.06 per cent at HK$2.375. They are now down 11.21 percent since the company first announced the $1.25-billion purchase of IBMs PC assets last December.

 Much of the profit drop was due to a surprise 12 per cent fall in Lenovos corporate PC sales in China, an area where international rivals like Dell and Hewlett-Packard have been very aggressive, said BNP Paribas analyst Marvin Lo.

 He added that the IBM purchase may provide some short-term relief in the form of cost reductions, as Lenovo tries to turn the unit around over the longer term.

 The IBM deal will help to reduce some costs, at least in the purchase of components, he said. 

 Lenovo reported a profit of HK$166 million ($21 million) for its fourth quarter ended March 31 compared with HK$188 million a year earlier.

 Analysts had expected the company to report a profit of HK$194 million for the quarter, according to the average of 21 analysts polled by Reuters.

 Quarterly revenue dropped to HK$4.71 billion from HK$5.04 billion, led by the fall in corporate PC sales.

 The report was the first for Lenovo since its IBM purchase, a move aimed at expanding abroad amid slowing growth and stiff competition in its home market.

 Following the deal, which closed last month, Lenovo expects gross margins to hold steady or go up in the current fiscal year, chairman Yang Yuanqing said at a media briefing to discuss the results. 

 The companys gross margins rose slightly to 14.75 per cent in the latest fiscal year from 14.62 a year earlier.

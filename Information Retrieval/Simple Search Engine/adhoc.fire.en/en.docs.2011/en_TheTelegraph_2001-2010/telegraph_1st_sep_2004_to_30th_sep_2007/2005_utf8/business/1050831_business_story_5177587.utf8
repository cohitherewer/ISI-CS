 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 GP Goenka: Promises kept

 Calcutta, Aug. 30: Duncans Industries, the flagship company of the GP Goenka group, will start repaying its 60,000 fixed deposit holders from the fourth quarter of this financial year. The total amount of fixed deposit is Rs 90 crore. 

 ?We have reopened our fertiliser factory at Panki, Kanpur today. This will lead to a quantum jump in our cash flow. Once the cash flow situation improves we will start paying the FD holders. From a turnover of Rs 125 crore, we will become a Rs 1,000-crore company following the reopening of the fertiliser plant. The fertiliser plant contributed 80 per cent of our turnover,? Goenka told The Telegraph. 

 For the last four to five years the company has not been able to pay the FD holders. 

 ?After the fertiliser plant closed down we were not in a position to repay the money,? Goenka said.

 The depositors have also approached the company law board. CLB had issued a repayment schedule but the company failed to meet that due to a severe cash crunch. 

 SBI Caps has worked out a corporate debt restructuring package, which was okayed by the lenders led by the State Bank of India.

 Goenka had to put in Rs 30 crore to restart the plant. The lenders ? SBI, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, Central Bank of India, Uco Bank and State Bank of Travancore together chipped in Rs 57 crore.

 ?We expect the plant to stabilise within the next three months. Once it does we will start repaying our creditors,? Goenka added.

 The company has a huge debt burden of Rs 900 crore and according to the CDR package it will be retired over a period of 12 years.

 Chand Chhap 

 Duncans has drawn up plans to revamp Chand Chhap, a strong fertiliser brand in the Hindi heartland.

 Goenka said other agricultural products would be introduced under this brand. ?Agriculture is an important sector in the Indian economy. Our internal team is working on what products can be added under the Chand Chhap brand. We hope to come out with new products in the current financial year,? he said.

 Duncans also plans to revamp its tea business once the cash flow situation improves. ?We could not do anything for our tea gardens. We will take up certain tasks now. However, our talks with Twinings to sell our brands have not yet taken shape,? he said.

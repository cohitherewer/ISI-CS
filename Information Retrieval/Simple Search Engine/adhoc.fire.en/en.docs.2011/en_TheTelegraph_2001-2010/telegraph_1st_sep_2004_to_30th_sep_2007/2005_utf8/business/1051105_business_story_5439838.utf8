 Real-time surveillance 

 Panaji, Nov. 4 (PTI): The Securities and Exchange Board of India will soon install an integrated market surveillance system to check irregularities in stock markets by monitoring trading throughout the day.

 As of now, you only see the action at the end of the day because we depend on reports from exchanges. If we see anything untoward on our screens, we make a phone call to clarify the matter. However, with this system, intra-day action will be possible as exchanges will keep feeding the information throughout the day, Sebi chairman M. Damodaran told reporters.

 We will still have to get the information from exchanges, but they will continuously feed it to us in the format that we want. This will make it much easier for us to take any action if anything is out of the ordinary. We will be one of the few countries to have this technology, he added.

 Damodaran is on his way tonight to Australia, where the technology has been developed. He will survey the bourses there to see how it works.

 When asked about the fluctuating nature of the stock markets because of speculation, the chairman said: As a market regulator, I am not worried by numbers. I should only be worried if there is a price movement in any stock that cannot be explained, that is when we step in.

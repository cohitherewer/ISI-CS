 Rediff struts the stuff in ADR parade

 Guess which Indian company listed in the US has notched up the highest gains this year? No, it?s not one of our IT stars like Infosys or Wipro or Satyam. As the table shows, Rediff.com has been the star performer this year, with returns of over 100 per cent. (The table gives the year-to-date ADR performance till November 4, and although Rediff has lost quite a bit of ground since then because of its proposed ADS issue, its returns are still the highest.)

 Why is Rediff ranked so high? Well, the company turned around in the June quarter, and its results for the second quarter show net profits of $307,000, up from a net loss of $381,000 a year ago. Revenues have increased 44 per cent with revenues from India Online, which has online advertising and fee-based services, up 89 per cent. Registered users have risen by 18 per cent, new products have been launched and margins are up.

 The company has been quick to take advantage of the change and proposes to raise $48 million by offering 3 million ADS at a price of $15.86 per ADS. Given the renewal of interest in Internet stocks (Chinese search provider Baidu.com was valued at 300 times cash flow recently), and the online advertising market in India showing growth, it?s best to strike while the iron is hot. As an analyst said, the India story plus the Internet story is a very attractive selling proposition.

 Sify, the other Indian Internet company listed on the Nasdaq, has also benefited. Satyam?s divestment of its entire stake in Sify led to a sharp jump not only in Satyam but also in the Sify ADR, wiping out its entire negative returns for the year. Sify had posted a second quarter loss of $1.4 million, a third more than its net loss in second quarter last year. That?s not only because of the relief that Satyam?s efforts to get out of Sify have finally borne fruit but also because Infinity Capital will be pumping in additional capital into the company.

 Tata Steel-Bluescope deal

 For both Bluescope and Tata Steel, the joint venture to manufacture value-added downstream products is part and parcel of their aim to move up the value chain. Tata Steel will be entering the emerging building materials sector with a range of Bluescope?s branded steel products for building and construction applications, including premium coated steels, roll formed steel products and PEBs (pre-engineered buildings). Recall that Tata Steel has recently commissioned a re-bar mill to focus on products for the growing construction sector. The JV is also aimed at establishing a leadership position in a rapidly growing section of the market.

 But the backdrop to the move is the continuing uncertainty about steel prices, with excess inventories unlikely to be used up before the end of the year. Nippon Steel, Posco and Baosteel have all cut prices to customers in response to increasing oversupply of lower-grade products. Higher volumes and higher-end products will help cushion the downside when the proposed additions to steel capacity lead to an oversupply situation in future, just as has happened this year. Hence, the hunt for mining rights and value-addition.

 Reliance Info in launch overdrive

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Clear call

 Mumbai, Jan. 5: In the next three months, Reliance Infocomm will more than quadruple its footprint from 1,100 towns to over 5,100, dwarfing its scale of initial national rollout.

 ?It?s a dynamic situation. Almost every day we are announcing a launch in a new town,? said Mahesh Prasad, president (applications and solutions group) at Reliance Infocomm.

 Reliance officials said it is covering 1,400 towns at present. According to telecom analysts, this will help Reliance Infocomm compete on a better footing against Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL), which has ramped up numbers by focusing more on the rural hinterland.

 Reliance Infocomm has maintained in the past that its target is to achieve a 20-million subscriber base, up from the present 10 million, as it extends its coverage across the country.

 Analysts have maintained that 180-200 million Indians are potential subscribers. However, the only impediment is infrastructure, which is still being put in place.

 Reliance Infocomm, while maximising its reach, will do it alone by setting up its own infrastructure. On the other hand, the Tatas, while going national with Tata Indicom, are amenable to sharing infrastructure with other national players such as Bharti, Hutch and regional ones like HFCL in Punjab.

 Reliance and BSNL have so far believed in setting up their own base stations.

 Even as it ramps up its wireless telephony capacity, Reliance Infocomm?s plans for retail broadband is expected to fructify only by December 2005 in select towns.

 Meanwhile, Reliance Infocomm will soon start charging for services offered through its ?R World?, a web-based platform.

 ?We will soon charge for the R World services and the charges would be based on the content provided and operators,? said Prasad.

 ?The charges will be on a par with those of the existing service providers and some of the services will be better than our competitors. The company is aiming at offering affordable rates for the masses,? he added.

 R World offers over 120 different services, including gaming. The platform serves over 12-15 billion pages in a year, he said.

 Reliance Infocomm today also announced a tie-up with Indiatimes for 8888 SMS-based services. This enables RIM prepaid and postpaid subscribers to download value-added services such as the latest ringtones, games, contests and text-based services.

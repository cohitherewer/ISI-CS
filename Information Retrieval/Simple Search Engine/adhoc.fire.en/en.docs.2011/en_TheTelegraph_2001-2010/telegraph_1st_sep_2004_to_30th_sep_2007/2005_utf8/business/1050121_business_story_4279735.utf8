 Competition panel controversy ends

 R.VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Jan. 20: The Supreme Court today settled a major controversy over the appointment of the chairman of the proposed Competition Commission when it accepted the Centre?s offer to amend the law so that a retired judge of a high court could head the body.

 The Competition Commission will replace the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (MRTPC).

 A division bench of justices B. N. Agrawal and P. K. Balasubramanyan directed the central government to ?carry out? its proposed amendment to the Competition Commission Act, introducing a provision for the body to be headed by a retired high court judge.

 With this judgment, the court disposed of a petition challenging the constitutional validity of the act. It, however, said the questions raised in the petition could be considered by the court after the Centre carried out the amendment.

 The main objection to the commission being headed by a ?non-judicial expert? is that it undermined the judiciary as a high court would have to carry out the orders of the panel. 

 The petition sought to quash the existing act so that a judicial person, a retired judge of the Supreme Court or a high court, could head the body. The government had offered to amend the act to enable a retired high court judge to head the commission and a district court to implement the orders. 

 The judges made it clear that if the Centre did not amend the law enabling the appointment of a judicial person to head the commission, the questions raised in the petition would be taken up for consideration by the court.

 The petition by one Brahm Dutt contended that the government was trying to take away adjudicatory functions from the judiciary and give them to an expert body. The Centre in its affidavit stated that it was prepared to make vital amendments to the law to make it acceptable to the apex court.

 The Supreme Court had severely criticised the Centre, objecting to the appointment of a bureaucrat to head the commission having quasi-judicial powers and also to the fact that the decrees of the commission were to be executed by a high court.

 The government agreed to set up an appellate competition commission headed by a retired judge of the apex court or a retired chief justice of the high court but contended that the expert body be headed by an expert than a person with judicial experience.

 The Centre filed an affidavit stating that it was prepared to make vital amendments to the law to make it acceptable to the apex court. The amendments included the creation of an appellate commission to be headed by a retired or sitting judge of the Supreme Court and that the orders of the commission would be carried out by a lower court and not by a high court as envisaged in the original act.

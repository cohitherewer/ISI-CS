 Bargain with Boeing bears fruit for A-I

 Ready for flight

 New Delhi, Dec. 24: Theres good news for Air-India. A group of ministers, set up to renegotiate a $9-billion aircraft deal with Boeing for Air- India, has managed to get discounts worth $221 million (Rs 1,000 crore) and a counter deal that will see India paying 30 per cent of the price of goods manufactured here.

 The discounts and the barter trade with Boeing are similar to a deal struck with Airbus in September this year. The team also managed to get investments worth $205 million from Boeing and aircraft engine-maker GE.

 The final Air-India deal works out to around Rs 35,000 crore, officials said. The cabinet had approved the plan to purchase aircraft for the national carrier last week, subject to a final round of price negotiations. 

 Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will approve the purchase plan next week and Air-India will start receiving deliveries of planes from November 2006, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said today.

 Air-India needs new planes to replace its ageing fleet as well as to compete with British Airways, Virgin, Lufthansa and Singapore Airlines. All these airlines have been beefing up their schedules to India since early this year. 

 Patel said Boeing would invest in four training simulators worth $75 million, a maintenance, repair and overhaul base for Boeing aircraft valued at $100 million and other training and civil aviation requirements worth $10 million. GE will invest $20 million in an engine shop.

 The plan includes buying 50 aircraft for Air-India, including eight B777-200s (long range), 15 B777-300s (extended range) and 27 B787s for $6.9 billion and another 18 B737-800s for its low-cost subsidiary. 

 Both the A-I plan to buy 68 planes as well as the IA order to buy 43 airbuses for nearly Rs 10,000 crore had run into rough weather after groups of MPs wrote to the Prime Minister that the price at which these aircraft were being bought was way above those quoted to competing airlines. 

 Subsequently, the cabinet appointed special negotiating teams to beat down prices and bag concessions from the two rival aircraft makers ? Airbus and Boeing.

 In both the aircraft deals, the negotiations had been accompanied by hectic lobbying by both the US and French presidents as well as other top officials of the two countries. 

 Unofficially, India had also asked the US to part with sensitive technologies like an anti-missile system fitted to an aircraft and a special scrambler device as part of a package. This was cleared by the US government sometime back.

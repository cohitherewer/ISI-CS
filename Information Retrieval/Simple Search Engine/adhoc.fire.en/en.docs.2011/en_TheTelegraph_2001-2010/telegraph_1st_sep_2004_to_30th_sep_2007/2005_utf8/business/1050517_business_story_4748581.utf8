 Lower recovery hits margins

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 16: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has taken a hit of Rs 3,610 crore in the first two months of this fiscal because of under-recovery of Rs 2,045 crore in LPG and kerosene and under-realisation of motor spirit and high-speed diesel worth Rs 1,565 crore. The hit this year comes on the back of a burden of over Rs 7,700 crore taken by the corporation last fiscal on both these counts. 

 According to marketing director N. G. Kannan, while the under-recovery in LPG and kerosene during 2004-05 was Rs 6588 crore, up from Rs 2314 crore in 2003-04, the under-realisation in petrol and diesel was Rs 1189 crore. 

 Kannan, however, added that this additional burden suffered by the corporation would not make any impact on its capital expenditure plans this year. He also said IOC was in a comparatively better situation than standalone marketing companies like IBP. This was because good refinery margins could compete against marketing losses arising from unchanged rates of key petroleum products despite firm crude oil prices.

 The Left parties, which provide key support to the Centre, have indicated their opposition to a hike in petrol and diesel prices. For this fiscal, IOC is looking at a 6 per cent demand growth in fuels.

 Mohan: Concerned

 New Delhi, March 10: The government today said continuing foreign exchange inflows have posed ?macro management problems?.

 ?The continuous foreign exchange inflows cause macro management problems, but it is a nice problem to have,? Rakesh Mohan, economic affairs secretary, told reporters. 

 ?Nevertheless, it is an issue for monetary and fiscal managers,? the secretary said. Mohan, who was the deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India till last year, did not elaborate but he obviously was hinting at the fact that higher accretion of foreign exchange meant a steadily appreciating rupee. This could cause problems for Indian exports besides creating inflationary impetus at home. 

 Mohan was speaking at the India Trade and Investment Forum (ITIF) jointly organised by the Commonwealth Business Council and the Confederation of Indian Industry. 

 The government plans to completely wipe out revenue deficit by year 2009, he said, adding this would be done through the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) and continuing reform process will help achieve this. Mohan said the tax-GDP ratio has to go up for the revenue deficit and fiscal deficit to come down. Revenue deficit, which was 2.5 per cent in 1996-97, started rising and peaked to 4.4 per cent of the GDP in 2001-02. It has been estimated at 2.7 per cent for 2004-05 and 2005-06. 

 Fiscal deficit also has to come down to 3 per cent of the GDP by 2008-09, he said, adding, ?We are on track. Fiscal deficit was 6.4 to 6.5 per cent during 1993-94 but is estimated at 4.5 per cent this fiscal and 4.3 per cent in 2005-06.?

 With the reduction in the Centre?s deficit and more number of states enacting the FRBM legislations, Mohan said, ?The government?s borrowing will come down.?

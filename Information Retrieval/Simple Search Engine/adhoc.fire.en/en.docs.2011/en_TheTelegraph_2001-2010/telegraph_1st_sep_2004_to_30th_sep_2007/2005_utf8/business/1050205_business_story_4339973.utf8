 Birla lawyers on the offensive

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 4: The lawyers representing the Birla family today slapped a slew of charges against Rajendra Singh Lodha while arguing for the appointment of an administrator in the MP Birla group of companies. 

 Senior counsel S. B. Mukherjee submitted that it was a ?fit case? for the court to grant an interim injunction, restraining Lodha from disturbing the shareholding pattern in the MP Birla group. To establish his argument, Mukherjee cited some instances, ranging from transfer of Priyamvada Birla?s shares to suppression of details of her illness. He also raised questions about the way changes were made in the boards of the MP Birla group of companies and pleaded for status quo in terms of the will of Priyamvada Birla. 

 The will, executed in 1999, is at the centre of the inheritance controversy between the Birla family and Lodha. According to the city-based chartered accountant, Priyamvada Birla made him the sole beneficiary of the assets of the MP Birla group, which the Birla family is contesting in the high court.

 Questioning the veracity of the will, Mukherjee also highlighted that Lodha?s probate petition was not affirmed by any of the witnesses of Priyamvada Birla?s 1999 will. Shyam Sarkar, who also appeared for the Birlas, submitted that it was important for the court to consider the size and complexity of the estate while zeroing in on an administrator. He also submitted before Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta that Lodha became a member in the MP Birla group companies only after Priyamvada Birla took over the reins of the group after her husbands death and had misused the trust she had on him.

 Arguing for Lodha, Anindya Mitra contested the pray for appointment of an administrator with sweeping powers. He also reiterated that his client will not dispose of any of the assets of the group.

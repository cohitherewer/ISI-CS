 Talwar: Big deal

 New Delhi, June 29: The boards of Centurion Bank and Bank of Punjab today approved a merger swap ratio of 9:4. For every four shares of Bank of Punjab, its shareholders will receive nine of Centurion Bank.

 The new entity will be named Centurion Bank of Punjab, said chairman Rana Talwar. The proposal is, however, subject to statutory approvals.

 ?There is no cash transaction at all, only swap of shares. In keeping with RBI regulations, two independent valuers have recommended this swap ratio,? Talwar said. 

 KPMG India and NM Raiji and Company have acted as independent valuers for the deal, while Ambit Corporate Finance was the sole investment banker.

 To assure employees that their future will not be affected, Talwar said: ?There is no plan for downsizing at all. We are looking at an aggressive growth plan. Together, we have employees in excess of 3,200. Depending on expansion plans, we will add more employees.

 Talwar said: ?The new bank will have powerful earning potential and will follow world-class standards of balancesheet management and provisioning. Both banks have excellent young motivated staff and will help propel the new bank into a powerful brand.?

 The merger hopes to bring about synergies between the two banks. While Bank of Punjab is strong in the agriculture and SME sectors, Centurion is dominant in retail.

 In 2003-04, Bank of Punjab had posted a profit of Rs 37 crore. However, it suffered a net loss of Rs 61 crore in 2004-05. Centurion Bank?s profit after tax stood at Rs 25 crore in 2004-05. 

 Prior to the merger, Bank Muscat held 31 per cent in Centurion Bank, Capital Corporation had a 13.4 per cent stake and Sabre Capital owned 5.4 per cent.

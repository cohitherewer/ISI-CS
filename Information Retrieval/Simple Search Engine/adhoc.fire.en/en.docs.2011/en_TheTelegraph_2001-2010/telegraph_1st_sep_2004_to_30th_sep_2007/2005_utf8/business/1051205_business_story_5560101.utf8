 UTI to up foreign fund play

 GAURAV CHOUDHURY

 New Delhi, Dec. 4: UTI-II, the countrys largest mutual fund, is gearing up to increase its exposure in the overseas market.

 A senior official told The Telegraph that the asset management company has already tied up with American risk management firm State Street Global to identify opportunities in the overseas markets.

 Mutual funds in India are expecting regulatory authorities to announce more liberal norms to enable asset management firms to invest in overseas share and debt markets. 

 Currently, the entire mutual fund industry is allowed to invest up to $1 billion in the overseas markets. And, it comes with a rider. Investment is permitted only in equities of those companies that have a subsidiary in India in which the parent company has a minimum of 10 per cent stake. 

 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are reviewing the policy and fresh norms are expected in the near future. 

 Unlike some mutual funds in the country who have American or European parentage, UTI-II will have to prepare early, the official said.

 Many mutual funds operating in India have American or European credentials either through a joint venture or through a subsidiary operation.

 The Association of Mutual Funds of India is also believed to be in favour of allowing Indian mutual funds to invest in overseas bourses, which will help them give higher returns to subscribers.

 Sources said the primary concern of regulators Sebi and RBI to allow mutual funds exposure in overseas stock markets has been that of a foreign exchange flight. 

 The high levels of foreign exchange reserves have neutralised that concern to a large extent. Removal of the restrictions will actually help yield better returns for Indian subscribers also through the exchange rate differential, a fund manager said.

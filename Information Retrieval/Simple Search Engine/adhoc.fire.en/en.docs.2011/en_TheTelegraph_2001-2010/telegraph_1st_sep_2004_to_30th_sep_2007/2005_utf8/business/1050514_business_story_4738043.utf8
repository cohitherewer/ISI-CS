 Tatas eye drug research

 Mumbai, May 13: The Tatas are poised for a return to the pharmaceutical business through Rallis India. They have set their sights on a slice of the $65 billion that is spent globally on research in drugs and chemicals ? an area where outsourcing is increasingly popular.

 ?There are severe bottlenecks in drug discovery,? said V. S. Sohoni, managing director of Rallis India. The vehicle for the Tatas? entry will be Advinus Therapeutics, a new company that will conduct research in medicines. Heading it will be Rashmi Barbhaiya, a scientist who until recently spearheaded research and development activities at Ranbaxy.

 Advinus will accelerate the process of finding new drugs in a way that reduces the time taken for discoveries. Global companies now take 14 years on an average to find new pills, up from nine earlier, because authorities have become more alert and cautious with approvals.

 The Rs 65,000-crore Tata group quit the pharmaceuticals business in the late 90?s, but could hardly reconcile itself to the fact that it was missing out on a big opportunity. Chairman Ratan Tata even bemoaned the move recently. ?Pharmaceuticals, I do regret. I feel it was an area that we exited too quickly,? he said in an interview to a business daily a couple of months ago.

 The Tatas sold Merind and Tata Pharma to Wockhardt six years ago. They also shed Searle, a joint venture between Rallis India and G.D. Shaw. In biotechnology, Tata Industries has a small stake in the Bangalore?s Avestha Gengraine, founded by Villoo Morawala Patel. TCS offers software for clinical trials and processes that must meet US FDA norms. In healthcare, it sells a variety of hospital management solutions.

 Rallis chief Sohoni, however, made it clear that the Tatas were not interested in manufacturing drugs. ?We are looking at being a scientific entity rather than a manufacturing one,? he said. His colleagues explained that it is knowledge services which will be at the heart of the plan.

 The Rallis India board even set the ball rolling for the venture by transferring its knowledge services business, which includes a research centre at Bangalore, as a going concern to Advinus Therapeutics with effect from April 1. The proposed transfer, company officials said, will be for a consideration of Rs 26 crore.

 Calcutta, Feb. 5: PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) hopes to get some good news from the Reserve Bank in the next 10 days. 

 The firm has been in talks with the RBI regarding the latter?s advice against hiring PwC for audit services.

 ?We are continuously in talks with the RBI and expect a positive decision within a week to 10 days,? said Roopen Roy, managing director of PricewaterhouseCoopers, at a conference on internal audit organised by The Institute of Internal Auditors, India.

 The apex bank had issued instructions to commercial banks against hiring the audit and consultancy house around June last year. It had also advised non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) against hiring PwC.

 The department of non-banking supervision of the RBI in a communiqu? dated December 9, 2004, said: ?We advise that on the bank?s report in a matter relating to deficiencies observed in the statutory audit conducted by PwC and Lovelock amp; Lewes (L amp;L) in respect of commercial banks, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) is conducting an enquiry and its decision is awaited. 

 ?In view of this, we advise that you (NBFCs) may consider not to engage PWC and L amp;L for audit work of your company, till further advice from us in this regard.?

 Both PwC and L amp;L had received letters from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) requesting copies of the printed accounts of Global Trust Bank and the firms had forwarded the accounts. 

 Both the firms are part of the same global network of PwC. The action was taken against both the firms, following the audit conducted by them for Global Trust Bank.

 The department of banking supervision of RBI had sent two separate letters to banks cautioning them against both the firms.

 According to media reports, the firm has submitted a report to the RBI stating it had mentioned the non-performing assets (NPAs) figures of GTB as part of the auditors report to the annual report. The NPAs and its subsequent impact on the bank?s balance sheet has been mentioned in the annual report for 2001-02 and 2002-03.

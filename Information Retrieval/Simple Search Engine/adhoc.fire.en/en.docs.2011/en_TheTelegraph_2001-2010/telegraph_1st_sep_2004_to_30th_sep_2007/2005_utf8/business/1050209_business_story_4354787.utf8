 Maran hints at review of infotech act

 Mumbai, Feb. 8: The Union government is planning to review the Information Technology Act, 2000 to strengthen the new-age sector while efforts are on in full swing to increase Internet penetration throughout the country.

 This was stated by Union communications minister Dayanidhi Maran while inaugurating the ?Nasscom 2005: India Leadership Forum?, here today.

 While expressing concern over the digital divide in the country, Maran explained that as part of the government?s endeavour to catalyse the growth of Internet in the country, it is planning to connect all the Internet service providers (ISPs) in the country to a national exchange. This is being done to achieve efficient Internet traffic routing, cost reduction and improvement in the quality of service.

 ?In April, we expect four Internet exchange points to become fully operational. Most small and large ISPs will then route their traffic through this exchange to ensure the security of domestic traffic,? he added.

 On the digital divide in the country, Maran said currently the benefits of information technology are being enjoyed by the metros and tier I cities. It is, therefore, essential to take infotech gains to the masses and rural India in particular. 

 While some headway has been made by way of STD/ISD kiosks and Internet, the initiatives should gather steam, the minister said.

 Maran said a re-look at the Information Technology Act, 2000 is also ?in order?. This should be done to keep up with the rapidly evolving ICT (information and communication technology) sector, which is in a state of constant flux in tune with the global trends and developments.

 Without providing details on what is likely to be changed, the minister said the government would revisit various provisions of the act and remove ?unnecessary constraints?.

 Maran?s comments came after Nasscom chairman Jerry Rao made a strong case for bringing down the telecom costs. 

 Rao, who heads MphasiS, said this is essential as domestic companies are facing mounting wage bills. ?In telecom, though lot of progress has been made, the prices are high and they need to go down,? he said.

 Urging the government to improve the infrastructure, Rao said the entire information technology sector is still miniscule in comparison to giants like IBM. Even as the challenge is to grow, the country has the task to fulfil its own development goals.

 Later speaking at a session on ?Securing Global Leadership: How the Indian IT industry is preparing for the future?, Infosys chief mentor N. R. Narayana Murthy said the Indian infotech industry, comprising software services and ITeS, will have to continue with a 35 per cent plus growth during the next six years.

 Murthy, however, expressed concern that the sector?s per-capita revenue productivity has not been increasing. 

 On what should be done to become globally competitive, Murthy said while the industry depends too much on the top five companies, smaller companies should also participate in the growth process since they have better adaptability power than larger companies.

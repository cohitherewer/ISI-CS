 Patch-up prod to Haldia warlords

 Purnendu: Across the table

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: The company law board has advised The Chatterjee Group (TCG) and West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation to amicably resolve the dispute over Haldia Petrochemicals? stake sale.

 CLB chairman S. Balasubramanian suggested today that both sides should meet Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to work out a ?compromise formula?. TCG lawyers said the firm would seek an appointment.

 The board has given them a month to sort out the matter. Fresh hearings have been slated for October 26, 27 and 28. Balasubramanian said the row, sparked by the Bengal government?s stake sale to Indian Oil, would ?harm? HPL. Equity of 7.5 per cent had changed hands in a move that TCG lawyers argued brought down the stake of the Purnendu Chatterjee-owned firm in HPL.

 The board?s stance gives both sides a chance to reach a truce. A lawyer dealing with the case said ?the matter appears to be going into settlement mode? since the law board chairman has provided both sides a face-saver.

 Purnendu himself said he would write to the chief minister and try to initiate a dialogue. ?I have full confidence in the leadership of the state. I am hopeful that all the issues will be sorted out,? he told The Telegraph.

 Asked what shape the settlement could take, the TCG boss said, ?Let there first be a communication between us. Only then can we talk about the amicable settlement.?

 State government sources said it all depended on the chief minister. ?It is Bhattacharjee?s prerogative ? whether to open a dialogue with Purnendu or reject the proposal.?

 Some signs of a common ground did appear today as WBIDC and TCG agreed to postpone the extraordinary general meeting of Haldia Petrochem slated for October 14.

 The case reached the law board when TCG sought to have the Bengal government?s share sale to IOC rescinded. It did not succeed, but another share allotment worth Rs 135 core to IDBI was halted till the case was resolved.

 TCG claims it held the majority stake in HPL and any share put on the block should first be offered to it. The sale to Indian Oil meant a dilution in its own holding, though Purnendu had failed to rustle up cash when the state government offered to sell its 43 per cent stake. 

 Indian Oil has shown an eagerness to invest Rs 6,000 crore in turning Haldia Petrochem into a world-class petrochemicals hub, provided it was given management control of the company. TCG had been stalling the move. Having got a 7.5 per cent equity slice, it still feels it did not get a fair deal since the shares were issued months after it put the cheque on the state government?s table. 

 Another grouse was that IOCs name was used to get a better deal from financial institutions but there was an attempt to leave it in the lurch when conditions changed. Prior to the stake sale to IOC, WBIDC owned 36 per cent of HPL, TCG 61 per cent and the Tatas around 3 per cent.

 Federal Bank, LKB call off merger 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 7: At a time when consolidation in the banking sector is gaining momentum, two Kerala banks today called off their merger plans due to differences over valuation.

 Federal Bank and Lord Krishna Bank (LKB), involved in merger talks since last month, said discussions have been called off as they could not reach a mutually agreeable valuation.

 The process of due diligence went through amicably and both both sides had extended full cooperation . However, a mutually acceptable valuation continued to elude us in spite of our best efforts to arrive at one, Federal Bank informed the stock exchanges today.

 At a meeting held on October 5, the board of Federal Bank had given an in-principle approval to consider the merger. This was based on the condition that due diligence, valuation and necessary approvals from shareholders and regulatory authorities would be attained.

 The bank then decided to take a final view on the structure and process of such a merger if the outcome of the due diligence, valuation and other related studies were found acceptable to both sides.

 Federal Bank and LKB have a strong presence in Kerala. Reports suggested that Lord Krishna Bank wanted a valuation that was too high for Federal to accept. 

 Bankers feel the aborted merger is an indicatation that the process of consolidation in the banking sector is not likely to be smooth. One side likely to ask for higher valuations. In addition to that, bank managements are also likely to face a tough time persuading their employees to agree to a union. The problem could be more acute if a smaller bank is in the picture.

 This was seen in the case of employees, who had threatened to go on a strike if LKB was merged with it. They were concerned that the union would saddle them with liabilities that could prove harmful for Federal Bank in the long run.

 IA plans London flight

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 22: Indian Airlines (IA) plans to fly to London soon after leasing about 12 wide-bodied aircraft for long-haul operations.

 IA will bring competition to the lucrative, but already competitive India-UK market, where British Airways, Air-India, Virgin and Jet are vying for space. 

 London is in our plans for connectivity, said IA commercial director Anil Goyal on the sidelines of a press conference here today to announce a tie-up between the airline and Reliance Infocomm.

 IA plans to lease over 17 aircraft over the next few months, including 12 long-haul planes, to bridge the gap till its order from Airbus arrives.

 We expect the delivery of our new fleet to start in September 2006. For the interim period, we plan to lease 12 wide-body long-haul aircraft, five Airbus 319 and few more A320s over the next few months to meet the requirements, Goel said.

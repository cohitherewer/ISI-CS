 Ports to rope in private firms for dredging drill

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 More on the Horizon

 New Delhi, Oct. 9: Private players can now take part in dredging operations at major ports of the country. The shipping ministry has asked the chairmen of big ports to scout for private participation in dredging operations required to increase harbour depth. 

 The proposal was discussed at a meeting of the high-level committee on infrastructure recently and, reportedly, the finance minister has given his approval for the move. 

 Shipping secretary D.T. Joseph has asked the port authorities to work out various percentages of funding by private parties, the management model that needs to be put in place and the terms and conditions that have to be spelt out before implementing the policy.

 The government is also planning to allow the private companies to collect a levy or cess in order to recover their investments in port works ? in the same way as toll is collected at highway bridges or expressways.

 The port authorities have been asked to send their suggestions on the issue to the shipping ministry soon so that it can draw up the final plan, which will then be submitted to the finance ministry.

 The issue assumes importance as the country lacks dredging capacity while it is amongst the worlds largest market for such operations. Most of the Indian ports are shallow and require constant dredging for maintaining the water depth at the harbour mouth, while some ports have to be further deepened to increase their capacity to take in larger ships.

 Foreign dredging cartels, comprising mainly Dutch and Belgium companies, have been fleecing Indian ports.

 An enquiry conducted by shipping secretary D.T. Joseph revealed that the prices charged by the foreign companies were up to twice as much as their Indian counterparts for the same work. 

 India has only a few dredging companies and the foreign cartels appear to be exploiting this weakness to the hilt. The largest Indian company is the public sector Dredging Corporation of India, which also handles the entire dredging operations of the Calcutta port. The others are a few small companies such as the Gujarat-based Jisu.

 Another issue is whether the dredging companies should be made to guarantee the maintenance of a particular depth in their areas of operation. 

 Currently, the amount of work done is measured in terms of the amount of soil that is excavated. However, the silting process resumes and the river/sea bed often rises again to the previous level. 

 This is a big problem particularly for the Calcutta port.

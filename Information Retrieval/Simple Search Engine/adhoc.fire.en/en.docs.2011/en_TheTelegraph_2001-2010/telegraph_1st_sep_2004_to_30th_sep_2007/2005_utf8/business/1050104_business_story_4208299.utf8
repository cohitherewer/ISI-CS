 Xilinx to boost presence

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 3: The US-based Xilinx plans to strengthen its Indian operations to focus on the growing market for semiconductor chips in the Asia-Pacific region.

 The $1.6-billion company had entered into a tieup with the Tata-owned CMC Limited to set up its centre at Hyderabad.

 Richard Sevcik, executive vice-president, programmable logic solutions, Xilinx, said, ?Forty per cent of our revenues are generated from Asia and Japan. This market is growing at 25 to 30 per cent every year against the global growth rate of 20 per cent.?

 Globally, the re-programmable chip market is estimated at $3 billion in 2004. According to Gartner, the market is expected to grow to $4.5 billion in 2006 and $6.3 billion in 2008.

 Xilinx is a global leader in programmable logic devices or chips whose functionality can be changed through software programming to suit the needs of the user. These chips result in saving 80 per cent cost and can also be designed faster that a 18-month period required for fixed programmed chips.

 Calcutta, Feb. 2: Bengal has attracted funds worth Rs 403 crore in the food processing sector in the last three years. Last year alone saw an inflow of Rs 200 crore as investments.

 The fund flow has forced the government to expand its proposed food park at Sankrail in Howarh. The park is currently spread over an area of 50 acres. 

 ?This is a new line of business for the state. We are receiving encouraging response from potential investors. This sector has attracted good investments in the last few years,? Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said while inaugurating the Frito Lay plant at the food park today.

 The government plans to acquire another 100 acres of land to accommodate more units. ?Seventeen units will come up within November this year,? said state commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen.

 Frito Lay India has set up the plant at Sankrail with an initial outlay of Rs 80 crore with two lines ? Lays and Kurkure ? in phase one. This investment has generated direct and indirect employment for almost 1,500 people. It has two other factories in Punjab and Pune. The total investment of Frito Lay in India is Rs 250 crore.

 The Bengal unit will produce 6,000 tonnes of chips and 8,000 tonnes of Kurkure.

 The company makes Lays potato chips, Kurkure, Cheetos Fun Snacks, Uncle Chipps and Lehar Namkeen in India. Its parent company, the $14-billion Frito-Lay International, is part of the $27-billion Pepsico group of companies. In India, the company has garnered 10 per cent share in the Rs 2,500-crore salty snacks market.

 Frito Lay India managing director Manu Anand said, ?We will make an additional investment of Rs 35 crore to add more lines depending on the demand.?

 Anand said Frito-Lay needed a manufacturing base in the east to meet the growing needs of the large snacks market in the region and Bengal emerged as the most attractive location for the investment.

 ?Bengal is also a large grower of one of our key raw materials ? potato,? he added.

 In Bengal, Frito-Lay is partnering with farmers to supply seeds and buy chip-grade potatoes from the growers. Agri programmes have commenced in Midnapur, Hooghly, Burdwan, Bankura and Ayodhya Hills of Purulia through 34 co-operatives and 850 farmers covering 1,000 hectares of land. The company expects to reach out to 1,600 farmers in the near future.

 The firm will buy 25,000 tonnes to 30,000 tonnes of potato from the state by 2007.

 Shaw: On track

 Bangalore, Jan. 20: Biocon Ltd has registered a 42.8 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 50 crore for the third quarter ended December 31 compared with Rs 35 crore in the same period last fiscal.

 Announcing the company?s financial performance, chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said revenues had increased 31.65 per cent to Rs 183 crore from Rs 139 crore earned in the year-ago quarter.

 Earnings per share (EPS) during the quarter stood at Rs 5 against Rs 3.9 in the year-ago period, registering a growth of 30 per cent.

 For the first nine months of this fiscal, Biocon posted a 63 per cent rise in profit after tax at Rs 155 crore against Rs 95 crore in the year-ago period.

 Revenue grew 39 per cent at Rs 550 crore against Rs 397 crore last fiscal. The EPS increased 46 per cent at Rs 15.50 compared with Rs 10.6 in the same period last year.

 ?Our recent collaborations with Nobex and Vaccinex have made a good start. We are on track for meeting our strategy and financial targets for this fiscal. Our business continues to expand and all sectors have recorded a healthy growth despite challenging conditions in the European statins (cholesterol reducing molecule) market,? Shaw said.

 The company?s quarter-on-quarter performance, however, has not been too rosy. Sales declined 6 per cent to Rs 178 crore in the third quarter against Rs 189 crore in the July to September quarter. Net profit plummeted by 12 per cent to Rs 50 crore from Rs 56 crore.

 ?We are going to see a lot of lumpy growth. Our performance has to be reviewed on an annual basis to get the true picture,? Shaw said.

 The biopharma segment contributed the bulk of sales this quarter at Rs 138 crore followed by enzymes (Rs 22 crore) and contract research (Rs 18 crore), she added.

 The company is expecting higher revenues from contract research and immune suppressants starting 2006, while mono-clonal antibodies would begin to have a positive effect on sales from 2007.

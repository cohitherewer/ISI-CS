 Aiyar plans to sever OVL from parent

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Oct. 6: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar has mooted a proposal to convert ONGC-Videsh into a joint venture firm by including downstream oil companies like Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum and GAIL as partners. Currently, ONGC-Videsh is a 100 per cent subsidiary of ONGC.

 ONGC chairman Subir Raha is unaware of such a move. However, he is opposed to the idea of any such separation of OVL from the parent company.

 He said ONGC has created the company and it has been being doing exceptionally well with the acquisition of oil and gas assets in 13 countries. 

 Aiyar believes his attempts to help clinch deals with oil-rich nations have not been carried to their logical solution.

 Capex juggernaut hits the slow lane

 One of the big stories in the Indian economy has been the revival of capital expenditure by companies. Firms have almost reached the limits of their capacity utilisation and there is no alternative to setting up new capacity. This story is borne out not only by corporate announcements of new projects, but also by the bulging order books of engineering companies. But, as CMIE data on addition to gross fixed assets (GFA) of non-financial companies show, the pace of growth in capex has been rather tame in fiscal 2005.

 The CMIE data show that GFA of non-financial companies rose by 8.5 per cent in fiscal 2005, a tad higher than the 8.3 per cent growth notched up in the preceding year, and way below the 17 per cent rate of growth in GFA in 1997-98. 

 The GFA growth in manufacturing companies was even lower at 7.1 per cent in 2004-05, and lower than the 7.5 per cent growth in 2003-04. The biggest rise in percentage terms was in the non-financial services sector, which saw its GFA rise by 19.8 per cent in 2004-05, while construction companies? GFA rose 18.5 per cent. 

 The data seem to support the conclusion that most of the growth in the last few years has been fuelled by consumption demand. At the same time, the spate of corporate capex announcements suggests that we should see higher GFA growth from the current year onwards. 

 Shipping Corporation 

 The government?s divestment of a 15 per cent stake in Shipping Corporation of India , if it goes through, will come at a time when the cycle has turned for the industry. That is best seen from SCI?s second quarter financials, which saw a 16 per cent drop in year-on-year operating profits and a 4 per cent fall in revenues. 

 Also, since freight rates were at record levels last December, and have halved since then, it is unlikely that the company will be able to improve its financial performance this year. Note that revenues have declined in spite of an increase in tonnage (due to the delivery of two VLCCs), which indicates how much prices are under pressure.

 The high freight rates had sparked demand for ships, and as these ships are delivered, the increased supply drives rates down. For SCI, things are worse, because it didn?t expand its fleet in time. True, the shipping ministry has said it has cleared SCI?s demand for 16 new vessels, but it will take time for the ships to be delivered, as there?s a long waiting list at shipyards. 

 For instance, analysts expect the two VLCCs the company had ordered earlier to be delivered only in 2008. Contrast GE Shipping, which ordered ships when their prices were lower. In other words, the pressure on SCI?s revenues and profits is likely to continue, although lower oil prices may help margins. Not surprisingly, the SCI stock has not only underperformed the market, but is also much less attractive than GE Shipping.

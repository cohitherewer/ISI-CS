 TCG sticks to guns on stake claim

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 27: The Chatterjee Group today stuck to its argument at the company law board that the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation did not have the right to sell the 7.5 per cent stake in Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) to Indian Oil Corporation for Rs 150 crore. 

 TCG reiterated its argument that it was a majority owner in HPL and it should have the first right to any sale of the governments stake. 

 Lawyers for the group went as far as to allege that the Bengal government was indulging in oppression and mismanagement. The hearing is slated to continue tomorrow.

 WBIDC had offered to sell its 43 per cent stake in HPL to TCG at Rs 28.80 per share but the latter did not come forward with the required cash to clinch the deal.

 After waiting for quite sometime, the state government decided to call off the plan to sell the stake to The Chatterjee Group and offered a 7.5 per cent stake to IOC.

 The Chatterjee Group had moved the company law board in August for cancelling the 7.5 stake sale to IOC. But the CLB had refused to annul the sale.

 The Chatterjee group fears that the government would reduce it to a minority shareholder after bringing in a huge company like IOC. 

 IOC had offered to invest close to Rs 6,000 crore to develop Haldia into a world class petrochemicals hub provided it was given management control of the company.

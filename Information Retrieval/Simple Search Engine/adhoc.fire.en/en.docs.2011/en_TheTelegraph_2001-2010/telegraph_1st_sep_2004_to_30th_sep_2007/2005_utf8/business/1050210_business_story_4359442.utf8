 Tata Power to raise $200 m

 Mumbai, Feb. 9: Tata Power Company has launched a $200-million five-year foreign currency convertible bond (FCCB) issue with a coupon rate of 1 per cent.

 The bonds are convertible at a 50 per cent premium over the closing share price of February 8 and bear a yield-to-maturity of 3.88 per cent compounded semi-annually.

 These bonds are likely to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. JP Morgan is the sole underwriter and bookrunner to the offering, which was launched after the stock exchange trading hours on February 8.

 Tata Power intends to use the aggregate net proceeds from this issue for capital expenditure in existing units, new projects and acquisitions. The company has planned a capital expenditure of Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 crore for the next three years.

 Many Indian companies, including those from the Tata group, have raised funds through FCCBs at cheaper rates. Last year, Indian Hotels and Tata Motors have raised resources at rates lower than that prevailing in the Indian markets.

 Bharti Tele-Ventures, Reliance Energy and Zee Telefilms have also raised funds through FCCBs.

 Tata Power is currently implementing a 120-MW power plant at Jojobera, which is expected to be fully operational by October. The Rs 350-crore project will augment the total installed capacity at the Jojobera power plant to 427.5 MW. Tata Power had acquired the 330-MW Shrinagar Hydro Power Project in Uttaranchal last year.

 In addition, Tata Power has in principle agreed to partner with Damodar Valley Corporation for the proposed 1000-MW Maithon right bank thermal power project. 

 The company is also eyeing an investment proposal to set up a 1,000-MW gas- based power plant in Bangladesh.

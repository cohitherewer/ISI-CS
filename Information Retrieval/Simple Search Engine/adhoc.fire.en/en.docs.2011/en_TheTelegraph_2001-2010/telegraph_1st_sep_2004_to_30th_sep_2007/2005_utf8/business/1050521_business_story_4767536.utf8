 Sebi clears decks for BSE makeover plan

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 A step forward

 Mumbai, May 20: Sebi today put the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on course for a makeover that would finally turn it into a corporatised entity with clear dividing lines between trading rights and ownership privileges.

 A key condition is that at least 51 per cent of its equity should always be with shareholders who do not trade. This means that BSE shares could be traded on the bourse itself.

 The order, signed by Sebi chairman M. Damodaran, also said the exchange would be known as Bombay Stock Exchange Ltd after the process of change is completed.

 So, a non-profit exchange will become a profit-oriented entity whose assets will be used to sustain its operations. At present, the exchange is an association of brokers, which ran it until as recently as five years back.

 The market regulator has laid down ways in which BSE?s ?assets and reserves? should be used. The objective is to ensure that these should not be used for the ?benefit or enrichment of trading members at any point of time?.

 Observers see this as an attempt to protect the existing assets before the bourse is converted into a corporate entity. ?The assets and reserves built from the support of the public system should be used only for the purpose of operating it as an exchange,? the Sebi order said. BSE officials were guarded in their reaction, saying they were still studying the set of conditions and were not in a position to offer comments on the decision of Sebi.

 The 130-year-old exchange, which has over Rs 17,00,000 crore of shareholder wealth sloshing around, clocks an average traded turnover of around Rs 2000 crore.

 The order and the scheme have been submitted for publication in Sebi?s official gazette. By restructuring its constitution, the exchange?s ownership and management will be segregated from the trading rights of its members. 

 Initially, the membership cardholders of BSE will become shareholders of the exchange and enjoy the right to trade. Sebi said a limited trading member ? the ones who sign up after paying a deposit ? can also deal in shares. 

 After corporatisation and demutualisation, there will only be one class of trading members with similar rights and privileges.

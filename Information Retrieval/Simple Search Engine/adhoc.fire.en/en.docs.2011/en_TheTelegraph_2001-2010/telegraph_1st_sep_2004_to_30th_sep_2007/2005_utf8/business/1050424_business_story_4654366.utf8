 IPCL confirms Anil?s exit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 23: After some amount of dithering, Indian Petrochemicals Corporation, a Reliance group company, has finally informed the bourses that it has accepted Anil Ambani?s resignation as vice-chairman and director of the company.

 IPCL, the Vadodhra-based petro-chemicals company, is headed by Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani.

 IPCL informed BSE today that Anils resignation had been considered on January 20 and that ?he ceases to be on the board of the company?. IPCL sent this communication by way of clarification for its earlier letter dated January 20. 

 In that letter, IPCL had said that Anil?s resignation was considered by the board that day and it had asked him to reconsider it. There was no further communication on this subject till Friday this week.

 IPCLs statement on Friday that the board had again noted his resignation at the March 30 board meeting means the issue was not dealt with till the end of March.

 The circumstances that purportedly forced Anil to hand in his resignation in January were different. Anil?s differences with Mukesh Ambani had reached a trigger point at that time. However, the suspense over the acceptance of the resignation and the absence of any protest from any part of the Ambani family has added fuel to rumours about settlement between the brothers.

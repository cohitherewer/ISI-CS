 Calcutta, Dec. 26: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has called for reviving sick PSU engineering firms Burn Standard and Braithwaite to give a fillip to the manufacturing industry in the state.

 Speaking at the golden jubilee celebrations of the Engineering Export Promotion Council (eastern region) here today, he slammed the previous NDA governments wrong policy for sickness and closure of many PSU engineering units.

 I have taken it up with the present government and the ministry concerned. I am in touch with heavy engineering minister Santosh Mohan Dev, Bhattacharjee said.

 Bengal used to hold a leading position in the engineering sector in the years following the independence, but slipped from its pre-eminence thereafter.

 The chief minister also pitched for reviving mining company MAMC.

 Iron ore policies

 Bhattacharjee rued the absence of any central policy on two key issues ? exports and inter-state movement of iron ore.

 We have iron ore reserves for only about 30 years. There should be a policy on whether to export the crucial raw material, he pointed out.

 Besides exports, Bhattacharjee also resented the lack of any central policy on the supply of iron ore by states to the steel manufacturing sector. Without mentioning Jharkhand, he said some neighbouring states are telling steel manufacturers that they would give iron ore only if the new units are set up on their land.

 He pointed out that Jharkhand governments refusal to supply iron ore to the Jindal group forced it to shift its business from Bengal to that state. However, they (Jindals) have said they would set up some downstream units here, he added.

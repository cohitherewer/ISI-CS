The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Rally signal in market fightback

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 2: Markets breezed into the new trading year ? Samvat 2062 ? with second straight day of gains in which the sensex raced 128 points to finish above 8000.

 Investors scarred by the lingering slump in stock prices are pinning their hopes that bourses have scraped the bottom and would return to their winning ways.

 One of the reasons for the optimism lies in Sebi figures that showed foreign institutional investors (FIIs) making net purchases to the tune of $11.5 million on Tuesday. This happened after their sales last month shaved close to 1000 points from the sensex within a month.

 The 30-share index opened at 7953.28, hit a low of 7891.23 but rallied to a high of 8086.84 before ending the session at 8072.75, up 128.65 points over 7,944.10 on Tuesday. It has advanced 387 points in the past three days.

 An indication of just how broad-based the claw-back was came from the fact that nearly all indices ended with a gain. The BSE Capital Goods Index led the pack, followed by the exchanges infotech and FMCG barometers.

 Cement stocks were among the days best performers, firming up on reports that some companies are planning to raise product prices in the high-demand western region. 

 Steel shares also sparkled, despite indications that prices in the industry could stay wobbly.

 The Federal Reserve on Tuesday hiked interest rates 25 basis points to a four-year high of 4 per cent, a move that typically unnerves investors in the local stock market. However, that did not happen as the rate concerns were overshadowed by a host of factors. One was the belief that a weak rupee will boost the export earnings of mainline infotech firms. 

 The Indian currency today plumbed a 12-month low of 45.29 against the dollar. It lost 13.5 paise over Mondays close of 45.15. 

 Sustained FII outflows have also weighed on the rupee, though the slide in crude prices below $60 a barrel was a comfort.

 Reliance, Infosys, Hindustan Lever, Bharti Tele-Ventures, HDFC, Tata Steel, L amp;T, Satyam Computers, Grasim and Bajaj Auto were top performers on Dalal Street, where trading volumes were low at Rs 2154.05 crore. 

 Suzlon Energy clocked the highest turnover at Rs 148.00 crore followed by SBI, RIL, Satyam Computers and Sesa Goa.

 Calcutta, July 27: Usha Martin has chalked out a Rs 462-crore expansion plan to step up speciality steel-making capacity, develop coal and iron ore mines and generate power.

 The company board has given an in-principle approval for the capex and has appointed ICICI Securities as merchant banker to work out the financing model.

 Managing director Rajeev Jhawar said it was looking at a mix of debt and equity to fund the expansion plan.

 The merchant banker will place its suggestion in the next three to four months. We will decide on the structure by then, Jhawar said on the sidelines of the companys annual general meeting.

 The entire expansion will take place in phases over the next three years.

 The company will spend Rs 400 crore to expand the capacity of speciality steel to half-a-million tonnes from 340,000 mt at present. The capital expenditure will also include mining of iron ore and coal and a 15-mega watt co-generation power plant.

 The company will start developing the iron ore and coal mines in Jharkhand by October 2005 and March 2006 respectively.

 The remaining Rs 62 crore will be spent on subsidiaries to expand wire and wire rod manufacturing capacities at home and abroad.

 After the mines are developed, we will be fully integrated ? from mines to steel followed by wire and wire rope as finished products, joint managing director P. Bhattacharya said.

 In future, the company will strengthen its presence in the automotive market with half of the speciality steel catering to this sector.

 We expect a strong demand from automobile and auto component sectors. We will operate only in the niche segment, chairman B.K. Jhawar said.

 The company has reported a 62 per cent rise in net profit in the first quarter of 2005-06 to Rs 13.23 crore from Rs 8.15 crore in the year-ago period. Net sales went up marginally from Rs 255.45 crore to Rs 264.05 crore.

 US venture

 Usha Martin will set up a greenfield plant in the United States. The company is looking at a 10,000-tonne capacity there to service the high-end market, Rajeev Jhawar said. 

 We will work out the details in another three months, he added. The company will invest about $5 million for the same. The US is the largest wire rope market with an annual requirement of 220,000 tonnes. At present, Usha Martin exports 10,000 tonnes to the US. We intend to become the largest player in the world, he added.

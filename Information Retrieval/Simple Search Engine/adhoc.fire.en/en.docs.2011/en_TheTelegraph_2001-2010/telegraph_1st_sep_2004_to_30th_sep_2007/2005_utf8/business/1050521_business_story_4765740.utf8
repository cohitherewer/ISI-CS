 China weaves new pattern in textile trade

 Beijing, May 20 (Reuters): China said on Friday it would increase tariffs on a range of textile exports to draw the sting out of an increasingly venomous trade dispute with the United States and the European Union.

 Chinas ministry of finance said the higher tariffs would apply to 74 textile lines starting on June 1, a move the American Chamber of Commerce in China said was constructive and France described as important.

 But the European Union struck a cautious note, saying it would seek details of the move with Chinas textile negotiator Gao Hucheng next week, when he is due to meet European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson in Brussels.

 The tax on most of the items would rise to 1 yuan (12 cents) per unit from 0.2 yuan, with the biggest tariff set at 4 yuan, the ministry said.

 Products listed included trousers, T-shirts and underwear.

 The decision was approved by the State Council, the ministry said in its statement.

 The initial tax of 0.2 to 0.3 yuan per item on 148 categories took effect on January 1 to coincide with the abolition of a decades-old system of global quotas on developing countries textile exports.

 The duty was too small to stem a long-predicted surge in Chinese textile exports and diplomats said that, even after the June 1 increase, the levy would remain small in relation to the big cost advantage that huge modern factories and cheap labour give Chinese textile makers.

 China has blown hot and cold over international reaction to the boom in its exports since the quota system ended.

 Officials have denounced steps by Washington and Brussels to hold back the tide as unfair while acknowledging that the spike in exports posed a political problem for China as well as for countries deluged by cheap imports.

 No backtracking 

 The United States has responded to the sharp rise in Chinese imports by imposing emergency curbs on trousers, underwear, shirts and yarn. For its part, the European Commission is seeking emergency talks on T-shirts and flax yarn that could lead swiftly to curbs on imports into the 25-member EU.

 European Commission spokeswoman Francoise Le Bail said the commission wanted to reach a negotiated resolution with China.

 It is clear that we would like to have a solution with the Chinese which is agreed by both sides, she told a news conference. On the other hand there are, on two categories at least, a situation which in our view create damages for the European industry.

 The president of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, Charlie Martin, welcomed Fridays move. This voluntary step demonstrates that China is adopting a constructive approach and is sensitive to the very real hardships which the removal of quotas has brought for some American workers, he said.

 We are encouraged by this move that the US and China may be able to resolve other trade differences with a similar sense of fairness and moderation, he added.

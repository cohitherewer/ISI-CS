 Chevron wins Unocal race

 In expansion mode

 New York, April 5 (Reuters): ChevronTexaco Corp won a close race to scoop up smaller California rival Unocal Corp for about $16.4 billion on Monday, pocketing prized assets in Asia and expanding its reach in the Gulf of Mexico. 

 The deal ? rumours of which had set shares of No. 9 US oil and gas producer Unocal ablaze since December ? gives ChevronTexaco a production portfolio that stretches from the waters off Indonesia and Myanmar to Congo and Brazil. 

 Analysts hailed the deal as a good fit for the No. 5 global oil company?s strategy to grow and a boost for its efforts to compete on the same playing field as much larger rivals like Exxon Mobil Corp and BP Plc. 

 ?This points to something very important ? a strategic change from a focus on returns to a focus on long-term growth,? said A.G. Edwards senior energy analyst Bruce Lanni. ?Chevron needs to be in a competitive position with companies like Exxon, BP and Shell and the areas they were not the strongest were Asia-Pacific and the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico.? 

 The deal, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval, came as oil prices surged to a fresh all-time high above $58 a barrel on Monday, after a steady ascent in recent months. 

 Surging prices have showered a cash windfall on oil companies, but declining exploration opportunities coupled with limited access to oil-rich regions such as the Middle East and Russia have left many searching for acquisitions to grow. 

 Of particular interest to Western majors is Asia, a region that has reshaped the energy landscape over the past year because of its burgeoning demand for oil ? and one in which Unocal has the largest exposure to among its US peers. 

 ?If you look at where all the assets are they are pretty close to hot markets,? said Morgan Keegan analyst Subash Chandra. ?It?s just a substantial oil company that is up for sale and that is rare in this business.? 

 Despite its enviable presence in the East, Unocal has historically underperformed peers and struggled with production declines. But booming oil prices helped it post record earnings in 2004, giving Wall Street a sense that its performance had finally turned a corner. 

 Last month, Unocal also settled lawsuits that accused it of ignoring human rights abuses, including slave labour and murder during the construction of a pipeline in Myanmar, closing the chapter on a dispute that had blemished its reputation.

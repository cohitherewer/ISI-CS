 Cabinet plugs in electricity policy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 2: The cabinet today cleared the National Electricity Policy, which aims to popularise the open access system, provide power to rural areas and to improve the financial health of state electricity boards.

 The policy, which will be unveiled tomorrow by Union power minister P. M. Sayeed, has set certain objectives to be achieved over the next five years. 

 According to the Electricity Act, 2003, the policy will serve as a guideline for power regulators at the Centre and states.

 Union finance minister P. Chidambaram told reporters after the cabinet meeting that the new policy will help attain the target of electricity to all households in the next five years. 

 The response of 13 states to the contentious issue of reforming electricity boards and the powers of regulatory commissions have been addressed in the new document.

 According to a senior power ministry official, the policy contains a package to electrify 80,000 villages by 2007, of which 18,000 would be electrified under different programmes of ministry of non-conventional energy. 

 Since state electricity boards would have to make large investments to electrify villages, they may get loans at special interest rates, varying from 2 per cent to 4 per cent. The project will be clubbed with Prime Minister?s Gram Rozgar Yojana and a few others.

 A senior power ministry official said: ?The policy proposes to extend the benefit of special interest rate to private companies. We are aware that they are unlikely to enter rural areas but proper incentives should help people in villages get electricity. The policy aims to do that.?

 ?The policy was overdue. But now it has been evolved in consultation with all stakeholders. It takes into account the views of state governments, Central Electricity Authority, Central Electricity Regulatory Commission and others,? Chidambaram said.

 The document aims to achieve open access, as mandated by the Electricity Act, and lays out the way to achieve the goal of providing power on demand by 2012.

 The government will need additional generation of more than one lakh megawatt by that time. The demand of power has long been outstripping growth in supply.

 The new power policy aims at laying down guidelines for accelerated development of power sector, providing power to all, protect the interest of consumers and other stakeholders keeping in view the availability of energy resources.

 On Tuesday, Union power secretary R. V. Shahi said 8 to 10 private projects, which will generate, 10,000 MW will be cleared by March. Between January 2004 and March 2005, independent power projects with a total capacity of 14,000 MW are expected to achieve financial closure. ?That will be a significant achievement,? he added.

 Shahi pointed out that most of these projects would offer tariffs of about Rs two per unit. ?We are ensuring that charges remain in the range of Rs 2 to Rs 2.20 per unit.?

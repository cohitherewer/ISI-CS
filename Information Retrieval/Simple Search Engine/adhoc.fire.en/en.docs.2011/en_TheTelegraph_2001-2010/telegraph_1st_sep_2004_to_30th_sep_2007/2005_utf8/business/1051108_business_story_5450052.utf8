 FM sets date with bank chiefs 

 New Delhi, Nov. 7 (PTI): Finance minister P. Chidambaram will meet the chiefs of public sector banks on November 18 to review the half-yearly results of the banks and discuss ways of augmenting their capital by Rs 60,000 crore in the next 5-6 years.

 With a higher target in mind, the minister is expected to take stock of PSU banks lending to infrastructure, farm and small and medium enterprises sectors.

 Bankers, who are preparing for a date with the finance minister, said that the ministry may take up issues pertaining to performance of the PSU banks on various parameters such as business (loans and deposits growth), profit, income, non-performing assets and capital adequacy ratio. Consolidation in the banking sector may also be discussed in the meeting, sources said.

 Though Chidambaram has initiated the consultation on consolidation, a banker said mergers and acquisitions among public sector banks would take some time.

 Some of the financially strong banks are ready but M amp;As have to consider various issues like geographical and business synergies, manpower problems and technology integration, a banker said.

 M amp;As could be imminent for some of the financially weak banks those are not in a position to tap the market for raising additional capital ? neither will their balance-sheet allow them to meet the Reserve Banks prudential guidelines nor the Basel-II norms from March 2007.

 Tide turns for JNPT update

 Share the burden 

 Mumbai, Jan. 24 (PTI): The Union shipping ministry plans to take up the much-delayed Rs 2,200-crore channel dredging project of the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) with the finance ministry to finalise the financial modalities of sharing the cost of the project.

 ?After exploring various options, we will finalise the cost-sharing pattern of the project with the Union finance ministry in 10 to 15 days to expedite the channel deepening at port,? shipping ministry secretary D. T. Joseph said.

 He said the shipping ministry would recommend accepting the option of treating the outstanding interest amount of JNPT, owed to the government on its loan as the share in the channel deepening project or to finance it on its own or by the government.

 ?We need to clarify the cost-sharing issues on this project. Even JNPT can finance the project on its own. But for that a final approval is needed from the finance ministry,? he said.

 A senior JNPT official said the port has suggested the government to treat the outstanding interest amount of Rs 727 crore as the port?s stake in the Rs 2,200-crore project, which is now pending with the Public Investment Board (PIB) for final approval. 

 The first phase of the dredging would cost Rs 640 crore for deepening up to 14 metres from the current 12 metres and another Rs 1,600 crore for the second phase to take the channel depth up to 16 metres, the JNPT official said.

 He said the port was handling over 58 per cent of the container traffic in the country and it would focus more on the first phase of the dredging project as the third container terminal will soon be operational.

 ?Deepening the channel up to 16 metres would enable the port to handle new generation vessels as the shipping companies are opting for bigger vessels for economies of scale. This would also allow more main vessels calling at the port,? he said.

 The ports of Singapore, Dubai and Colombo are growing at the cost of Indian ports? inefficiency to handle bigger vessels, which is resulting in transhipment of cargo to foreign ports, Joseph added.

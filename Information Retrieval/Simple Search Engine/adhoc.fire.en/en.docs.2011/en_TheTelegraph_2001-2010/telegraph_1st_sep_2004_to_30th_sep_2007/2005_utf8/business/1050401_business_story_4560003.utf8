 Plan panel frown in VAT fury

 New Delhi, March 31: An internal document prepared by the Planning Commission seems to have taken the BJP line in attacking the Congress-led government?s bid to bring in nation-wide value-added tax. 

 The plan panel document criticised the introduction of the new nation-wide tax regime, saying it had ?serious design flaws? as entry taxes on goods transported from one state to another continue to co-exist creating a situation where the overall tax incidence on goods goes up to 30 per cent. 

 It also points out that many goods have been kept out of VAT, including petroleum products that are basic to manufacturing and transport. 

 ?There are serious design flaws in the suggested VAT structure. The proposed VAT does not extend to all indirect taxes on goods, as entry tax and octroi will continue,? the plan panel said in a draft mid- term appraisal of the Tenth Plan. 

 ?The combined incidence of central and state VAT is close to 30 per cent. It could be higher if we consider taxes that are going to be retained after VAT is introduced.?

 The document prepared by the plan panel could give a boost to VATs political critics ? the main Opposition party BJP and Mulayam Singh Yadav?s Samajwadi Party. 

 The Planning Commission wants the effective taxation rate on goods and services to come down to 10-12 per cent in line with the rates prevailing in Asean nations. This will make Indian industry more competitive. 

 The commission also criticised VAT proponents for not clearing the air on how central sales tax would be phased out, something which the BJP too had been vocal about. The Centre has, however, clarified that CST will be brought down to 2 per cent this year and reduced to zero next year. 

 The plan document also said the mechanism for inter-state transactions have not yet been spelt out. A system of giving tax credit to inputs bought from other states has not yet been put in place, it added. 

 Finance ministry officials, however, defended VAT by stating that tax credit for inputs bought elsewhere was part of the plan and would be brought in soon. 

 Meanwhile, even as the ideological quarrel over VAT continued, traders shut businesses in the north and parts of west and south India, for the second day as part of a three-day long strike protesting the introduction of VAT. 

 Last year, the BJP government had tried to bring in VAT but intense lobbying by north Indian traders and some states had forced the central government to junk the tax measure.

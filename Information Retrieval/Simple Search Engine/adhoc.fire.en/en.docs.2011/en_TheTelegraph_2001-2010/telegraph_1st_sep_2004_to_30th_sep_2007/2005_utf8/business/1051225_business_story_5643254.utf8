 Lodha: Looking ahead

 Calcutta, Dec. 24: Birla Corporation, an MP Birla group company run by Rajendra Singh Lodha, has bagged the top slot in cement production in Bengal.

 The company today started commercial production at its Durgapur plant, which has a capacity of 1 million tonnes.

 With this unit, the capacity of Birla Corporation will go up to 1.6 mt, making it the largest in the state, a company executive said.

 The company spent Rs 75 crore to set up a grinding unit, which will make fly ash-based portland pozzolana cement (PPC) there.

 While the clinker to feed the cement plant will be sourced from Satna in Madhya Pradesh, the fly ash will come from Bakreswar Thermal Power Plant and Durgapur Power.

 Chairman R.S. Lodha appreciated the contribution made by state agencies in setting up the plant. Following this expansion, Birla Corp?s total capacity will go up to 6.4mt, spread over seven units in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Bengal.

 The expansion of Birla Corp comes at a time when Lodha is involved in a bitter legal battle with the Birla family over the control of the Rs 5,000-crore MP Birla group assets. Birla Corp is the group?s jewel in the crown, earning the highest turnover and profit for it. Apart from cement, it has jute, vinoleum and auto trim divisions..

 Bengal cement sector

 Cement prices in Bengal are on the rise as mega investments are being made in the infrastructure and housing sectors. 

 Swiss cement major Holcim-owned Ambuja Cement Eastern will spend Rs 115 crore to set up a unit at Farakka. Industry observers put the demand for cement in the state at 6.75 mt annually, while the production is now 4.2 mt.

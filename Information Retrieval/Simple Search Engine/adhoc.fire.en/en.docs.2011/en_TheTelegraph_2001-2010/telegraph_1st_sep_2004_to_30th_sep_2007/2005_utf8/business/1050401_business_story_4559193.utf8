 External debt swells to $120 bn

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, March 31: The country?s external debt was up by 7.2 per cent to $120.9 billion till 2004 mainly due to a 14 per cent rise in short-term capital inflows.

 Long-term debt increased by a modest 6.8 per cent to $114 billion till December, according to the latest estimates of the finance ministry.

 Short-term debt went up by 14 per cent to $6.9 billion till December, the quarterly report on India?s external debt said.

 The external debt was up by 6.4 per cent, or $7.3 billion, to $120.9 billion till December against $113.6 billion at the end of September.

 ?A large part of the increase, about 57 per cent or $4.1 billion, is explained by the valuation change arising out of depreciation of the dollar against major international currencies,? it said.

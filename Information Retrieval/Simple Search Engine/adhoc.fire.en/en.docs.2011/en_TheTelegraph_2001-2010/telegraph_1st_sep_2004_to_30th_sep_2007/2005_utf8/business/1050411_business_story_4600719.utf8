 Still a smart choice

 MIPs of private mutual funds are a safe bet ? but they suffer from a perception problem, says Chandralekha Tulal

 Investors have a perception problem with monthly income plans (MIPs) of private mutual funds and most of the negativity can be directly traced to UTI MIPs.

 UTI had assured a monthly income to investors and they came to expect the same from MIPs of private sector funds, which do not assure dividends. Moreover, numerous investors perceive these MIPs as equivalent to post office monthly income schemes.

 Thus, the popularity of the MIPs has a chequered history. When they were first launched by private mutual funds, they evinced sufficient interest from investors in the hope of being provided a monthly income stream.

 But the stock market crash in 2001 saw a rapid withdrawal from any scheme and MIPs with even 10 per cent exposure in equities were not spared.

 Again the stock market revival from 2003 brought the fund, most suitable for even the most conservative investor, back in favour.

 MIPs reigned in 2003 and the first quarter of 2004. Eight MIP schemes were launched in 2003 and 15 in 2004. 

 But, the tide has turned rather quickly for MIPs. The schemes have now fallen from investors? grace.

 Analysts explain that this is the fallout of the misperception that MIPs are expected to provide monthly income streams. But the recent phenomenon is surprising, keeping in view that almost all MIPs, barring a few recent ones, have not skipped dividends despite the choppy market.

 As Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research says, ?Dividend payout by any type of mutual fund is not the criteria to judge the fund. One should look at the returns posted by the schemes and consistency is what should matter.?

 He says mutual funds distribute dividends from the accumulated surplus and any fund with a good performance record creates such buffer for volatile markets.

 The assets under management of MIPs have seen a large fall. As on December 31, 2003, total assets under management in MIPs stood at Rs 6717 crore, which increased to Rs 8174 crore on December 31, 2004. It has dropped to Rs 6251 crore on March 31, 2005.

 Kumar advises taking a look at the returns of MIPs too. He says a person investing in an MIP, on an average, expects a return of at least 8 per cent from the fund, equivalent to a post office deposit, which means a return of at least 2 per cent per quarter.

 A closer look at the MIPs reveal that most of the funds were unable to post a total return of 8 per cent last year, though in a few quarters they did manage to beat the 2 per cent benchmark return.

 Again, in the first quarter of 2005, the highest return posted has been 1.62 per cent, with the majority giving a return of below 1 per cent.

 So, should we write off MIPs?

 Though as an investor, one should have a benchmark return, MIPs as a product should not be criticised if the investment decision was based on the common misperception. Thus, drawing an absolute comparison between them and, say, post office schemes is like comparing oranges and apples. 

 While the latter can offer assured returns month-on-month, it is handicapped by its inability to counter inflation, something an MIP can because of the equity component. Moreover, top-performing MIPs over a longer horizon like a three-year period, have comfortably outperformed most assured return schemes. 

 Within the gamut of MIPs, investors can choose from schemes with equity holdings ranging from 5 per cent to 30 per cent of the entire corpus. While schemes with a higher equity component are likely to suffer more when markets fall, they are also better equipped to offer higher returns over a longer period of time.

 Existing investors who are invested in MIPs with equity exposure in excess of 10 per cent and are expecting monthly dividends need to reconsider their investments. With equity markets remaining choppy, the frequency of dividends may fluctuate sharply at least in the immediate future. 

 Investors may select a quarterly dividend option to enable the fund manager to declare a dividend consistently, which may not be possible on a monthly basis in the current market.

 If you have alternate revenue sources, stay invested in MIPs as over the longer horizon they will continue to be a smart choice.

 Reliance-BSNL payment case back to apex court

 OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 28: The BSNL-Reliance Infocomm tussle came back to the Supreme Court, which today stayed the proceedings before Delhi High Court hearing the private operator?s petition challenging BSNL?s decision to levy Rs 182.7 crore on it for alleged re-routing of international calls as local ones.

 The issue of jurisdiction would now be decided by the Supreme Court before the high court could proceed with the merit of the petition filed by Reliance Infocomm.

 A bench comprising Justices N. Santosh Hegde and S. B. Sinha also issued notices to Reliance Infocomm and other respondents on the petition filed by BSNL after briefly hearing its counsel, senior advocate Soli J. Sorabjee.

 BSNL had pleaded before the high court that it did not have the jurisdiction to decide the dispute between the two telecom operators, which rested solely with the Telecom Disputes Settlement Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT).

 It had also pleaded that the high court should first decide the issue of jurisdiction before hearing the merits of the petition.

 The high court had ruled it would hear the petition filed by Reliance and decide both the issues ? jurisdiction and the merits of the matter ? together.

 Aggrieved by this order, BSNL had challenged the order of the high court before the Supreme Court, which had earlier directed Reliance to pay up the entire amount before the matter was heard by the high court.

 It had rejected a plea of Reliance that it did not have money to pay BSNL and could only give a bank guarantee. The apex court had ordered Reliance Infocomm to pay Rs 84.7 crore to BSNL as ?access deficit charges? rejecting Reliance?s plea to allow it to furnish a bank guarantee for the said amount.

 Out of BSNL?s demand of Rs 182.7 crore, Reliance had already paid Rs 98 crore but pleaded that it could only furnish a bank guarantee for the rest of the amount.

 Bengal ready to flaunt knowledge edge 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Gautama: Eyeing more

 Calcutta, Sept. 21: The Bengal government is drawing up an extensive plan to sell the state?s potential of emerging as a knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) hub during IT East 2005 ? the flagship event of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 G.D. Gautama, principal secretary for IT, said the government would highlight ?advantage Bengal? during the two-day meet starting on September 23 to attract investments in the KPO segment.

 Shaqeel Ahmad, minister of state for communications and IT, will be the chief guest of the third IT East, which will coincide with CII?s national council meet and Manufacturing East. The theme this year would be ?KPO: Moving up the value chain?.

 While business process outsourcing (BPO) deals with only automation of transaction processing, KPO involves high-end analytical work such as financial analysis, equity research, animation, simulation, product development, engineering design and insurance underwriting.

 ?The ITeS companies in Bengal have a history of performing high-end analytical work for overseas clients and we think their volume of work will increase with time,? Gautama said, adding that 35 out of the 90-plus ITES companies in Bengal are involved in high-end processes.

 Industry leaders like Ashok Soota of MindTree Consulting, Balu Doraisamy of HP India, Raman Roy, Kapil Dev Singh of IDC India, Rahul Bhasin of Barings Equity and Pradip Baijal of Trai will be present at the meet to talk about the latest trends in the KPO space. 

 Besides, PricewaterhouseCoopers would come up with a white paper on KPO on the first day of the event. 

 ?Events like this give us the opportunity to showcase our strength. We have finalised appointments with the CEOs, whom we would meet off-line and explain why Bengal can become a KPO hub. We will make special presentations highlighting our strengths,? added Gautama. 

 According to forecasts, India will aim at garnering about 70 per cent of the $17 billion global market in KPO by 2010, which is more attractive to the ITeS companies because of higher margins. 

 The KPO industry is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of around 46 per cent over the next few years. 

 According to V. V. R. Babu, chairman of CII?s IT sub-committee in the eastern region, positioning Bengal as a KPO hub will be easy as the state has a host of natural advantages.

 ?Be it the number of chartered accountants or the number of scientific discoveries, Bengal is way ahead of other states. Critical financial functions and research and development are integral part of KPO and Bengal surely has an edge over other states,? said Babu.

 RINL turnover rises to Rs 8181 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, April 16: Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL), the corporate entity of Visakhapatnam Steel Plant (VSP), has notched up a record turnover of Rs 8,181 crore.

 ?The performance, both in production and sales, for the year 2004-05 was impressive and registered an increase of 10 per cent over previous years,? VSP chairman-cum-managing director Y Siva Sagar Rao told reporters here today.

 ?The performance is noteworthy given the fact that the plant had to cut back its production during the first half of the fiscal due to severe coking coal crisis worldover,? Rao said.

 It is for the fourth consecutive year that the company has surpassed its rated capacity, Rao added. 

 RINL is also eyeing the capital market to finance its expansion plans . 

 Vizag Steel Plant plans to spend Rs 8,500 crore on a massive expansion drive to raise production to 7 million tonnes from the present 4.5 million tonnes, Rao said.

 He said the company, which had reported operating profits and record production in the last few years, will meet the expansion cost of Rs 5,500 crore from internal accruals. 

 ?The remaining amount we hope to borrow from financial institutions and markets, provided the environment is good enough, quot; he said. 

 ?We may need approximately Rs 1,500 crore for equipment for which we can get credit from Exim Bank,? he said.

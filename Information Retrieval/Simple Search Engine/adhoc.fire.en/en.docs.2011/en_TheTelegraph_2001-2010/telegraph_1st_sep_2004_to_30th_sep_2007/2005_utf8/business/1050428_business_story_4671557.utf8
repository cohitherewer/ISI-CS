 Infocomm in black

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 27: Reliance Infocomm may or may not go to Anil Ambani when ?ownership issues? within the family are finally settled. But as the man behind the venture, Mukesh Ambani has delivered results that even his harshest critics will acknowledge as exemplary.

 Reliance Infocomm?s turnover surged 99 per cent to Rs 5,387 crore in 2004-05 against Rs 2,707 crore in the corresponding previous period. 

 Within two years of its launch, Reliance Infocomm has posted a net profit of Rs 51 crore against a loss of Rs 390 crore in the previous year.

 Reliance Industries owns 45 per cent of the infocomm venture. The company made headlines recently after it docked around one million subscribers to clean up its numbers. Mukesh Ambani and associates hold a substantial stake in the mobile telephony company. 

 Since inception, Reliance Infocomm has charted an independent path by going for a technology that was new to the country. 

 At a time when other service providers preferred GSM, Reliance Infocomm rooted for the CDMA technology.

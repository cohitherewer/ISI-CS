 Flat sales take fizz out of Coca-Cola earnings

 Bottled up 

 Wilmington, April 19 (Reuters): Coca-Cola Co on Tuesday reported an 11-per cent drop in quarterly net income, hurt by sluggish sales of soft drinks in North America, its largest market.

 The world?s largest soft-drink maker earned $1 billion, or 42 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with $1.13 billion, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased to $5.27 billion from $5.08 billion.

 Excluding special items, Coke said earnings would have been 47 cents a share. Analysts on average had forecast a profit of 43 cents per share on sales of $5.15 billion.

 Coca-Cola?s sales, as measured by unit case volume, rose 3 per cent, boosted by double-digit growth in China, Brazil and other emerging markets. Volume in North America, Coca-Cola?s most important market, was flat in the period.

 Reigniting sales of core brands, such as the flagship Coke Classic product, has been a top priority in North America since the company embarked on a sweeping restructuring of its global operations more than five years ago.

 Meanwhile, Coca-Cola Co has resolved the embarrassing US government probes into claims it engaged in accounting fraud and other wrongdoing in key markets, including Japan.

 Coca-Cola, which had been under a regulatory cloud since the allegations surfaced two years ago, said it did not have to admit guilt or face fines or penalties as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 The Atlanta-based company added that the department of justice had closed a separate investigation, which began after ex-Coke worker Matthew Whitley accused the company of fraud in a 2003 wrongful dismissal lawsuit.

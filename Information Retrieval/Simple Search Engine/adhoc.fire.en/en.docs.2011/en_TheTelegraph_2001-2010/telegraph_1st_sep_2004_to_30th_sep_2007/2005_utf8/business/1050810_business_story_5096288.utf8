 Anil tightens grip on Reliance Cap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Anil: Up we go

 Mumbai, Aug 9: Anil Ambani and his associates have raised their stake in Reliance Capital to 41.45 per cent by exercising the full entitlement in the preferential offer, while foreign investors were given a reduced number of shares than what was earlier reserved for them.

 RCL had reserved 2.90 crore shares for financial investors, including FIIs, after the board passed a resolution to this effect, but the company has now proposed to reduce the allotment to 1.62 crore shares, down over 44 per cent. After the preferential offer, the financial investors will own about 8 per cent of Reliance Capital.

 ?The shareholding of the acquirers will be 41.37 per cent of the capital after the preferential issue. The total shareholding of acquirers and Tina Ambani collectively will be 41.45 per cent of the post-issue equity,? the company said in a notice to exchanges.

 The new investors, including the new promoters, have made a killing as the preferential offer was pegged at a price of Rs 228 per share. The current market price of RCL is Rs 449.90, a notional gain of 97 per cent.

 It can be argued that the gains don?t mean much as the financial investors have a lock-in period, while the promoters of the company have invested mainly to allow the promoter group to gain control.

 No reasons were made available on why the preferential allotment for RCL shares was lower than previously envisaged by the board. It is speculated that one of the reasons could be the runaway price of RCL soon after the news that ADA Enterprises promoted by Anil Ambani will transform the non-banking financial company into a ?financial powerhouse?, with interests in insurance, mutual funds and banking.

 Marketmen speculate that the company management would be of the opinion that the foreign investors are getting the shares very cheap when the market price is much higher.

 Kotak Mahindra Capital Company is the manager to the offer on behalf of AAA Enterprises Pvt Ltd.

 On August 5, the board of RIL approved the de-merger scheme, which proposes to de-merge assets and liabilities of RIL?s telecommunications, coal-based energy, financial services and gas-based energy ventures. The appointed date for the scheme is September 1, 2005. 

 The scheme envisages the de-merger of the undertakings in four separate companies as going concerns. All shareholders of RIL (except certain specified shareholders) will be issued shares of the de-merged units in a 1:1 ratio.

 As a part of the scheme, RILs interests in the financial services, including its stake in Reliance Capital, will be transferred to Reliance Capital Ventures Ltd (RCVL). 

 All shareholders of RIL (except certain specified shareholders) will get one share of Reliance Capital Ventures for every share they hold.

 The specified shareholders will not receive shares of the resulting companies. RIL shareholders will receive proportionate benefits. 

 Reliance Capital Ventures may, in turn, be merged into Reliance Capital subject to regulatory and other approvals. 

 Anil and his associates may acquire additional shares in Reliance Capital if such a merger takes place, the notice said.

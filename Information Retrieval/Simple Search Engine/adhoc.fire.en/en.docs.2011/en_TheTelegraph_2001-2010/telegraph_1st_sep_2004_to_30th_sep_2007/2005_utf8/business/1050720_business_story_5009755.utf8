 Govt mulls broadband bait to jack up PC sales

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, July 19: Use the broadband carrot to drive computer sales; thats the government mantra these days. 

 The government is working on a scheme that will bundle broadband connections at Rs 10 per hour with low-priced computers bought for home use.

 The Rs-10-per-hour broadband package will work out cheaper for PC owners. The only other available broadband packages, 24-hour connections from BSNL and MTNL, cost Rs 500 per month. However, on an average, people surf the net for about an hour each day or 10 hours every week. At Rs 10 per hour, the monthly package could work out to just Rs 300. 

 MAIT, the apex body for the hardware industry, feels that low-priced PCs can drive growth up to a certain point. Market expansion will, however, only happen through development of local content and broadband applications.

 The PC industry is expected to grow at a rate of 17 per cent during the current fiscal against 20 per cent in the previous year. However, a 25 per cent growth can be achieved if broadband use increases.

 BSNL has a bundled offer for broadband with PC vendors like HP and Amar PC.

 The government is likely to bundle broadband services from BSNL and MTNL with sub-10, 000 PCs to penetrate the entry-level home market, especially in the rural areas.

 The broadband connection will help the growth of e-governance, e-health, and e-education, which will, in turn, drive PC penetration and market growth.

 The domestic market is growing and this is attracting investments into the hardware manufacturing sector. Bundling broadband with PCs will lead to growth in both the segments, said Vinnie Mehta, executive director of MAIT.

 Union IT minister Dayanidhi Maran is likely to announce the bundled offer during his visit to the city on August 5.

 During his visit, Maran will meet Bengal IT minister Manabendra Mukherjee to review the situation in the infotech sector and also discuss initiatives for growth. 

 He will also inaugurate the countrys first integrated PC manufacturing plant near Calcutta. The unit is being set up by the Xenitis Group, which will source components from Chinese major Unitech.

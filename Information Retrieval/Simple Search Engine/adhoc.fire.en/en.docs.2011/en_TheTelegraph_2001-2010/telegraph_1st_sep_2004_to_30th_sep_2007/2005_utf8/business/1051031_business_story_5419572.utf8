 Haldia Petro truce signal on the radar

 Purnendu: Walk the talk

 Calcutta, Oct 30: Chances of negotiations have brightened between Purnendu Chatterjee and the Bengal government to break the impasse on Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) stake sale to Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).

 The Chatterjee Group boss, one of the principal promoters of HPL, had written to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, asking for talks to work out a compromise, as urged by the Company Law Board (CLB).

 Writers Buildings sources say the Bengal chief minister has refused to meet him but asked his colleague, commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen, to get in touch with Purnendu. The meeting could take place after the second week of next month, when Sen returns from a two-week trip to China starting November 2. 

 Sources say Chatterjee is ready to make overtures for an out-of-court settlement to the spat over HPL stake sale. On September 28, law board chairman S. Balasubramanian had asked both TCG and West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) to meet the chief minister to work out a compromise formula within a month. Neither side has taken the initiative so far, even though the next round of hearings in the case has started.

 Sources say a patch-up will not be easy, given the state governments bitterness over Purnendus court lunge. The ball is now in the governments court and Purnendu must be cautious, a senior state government official said.

 Purnendu moved the law board to resist the governments decision to transfer 7.5 per cent in HPL to Indian Oil. At the root of the discord was the fact that the government did not allow the assets of Haldia Petrochemicals to be leveraged for his $5.7-billion acquisition of Basell Polyolefins. 

 Purnendu planned to pledge HPL shares for a Rs 2,500-crore loan that would help fund the Basell deal. He had even accused Bhattacharjees government of scuppering what would have been the largest global acquisition in which an Indian was involved. The state government reacted by selling shares to IOC.

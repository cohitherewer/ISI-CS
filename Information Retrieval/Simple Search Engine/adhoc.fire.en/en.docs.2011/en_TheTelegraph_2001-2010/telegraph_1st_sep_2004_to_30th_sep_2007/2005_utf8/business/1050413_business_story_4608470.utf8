 Samsung earnings to take a hit

 Future tense 

 Seoul, April 12 (Reuters): Samsung Electronics Co Ltd is likely to report on Friday that its first-quarter earnings shrank by a third, hammered by a slide in flat-screen prices and lower profit margins on mobile phones.

 Analysts say the outlook for Samsung, the most valuable technology company outside of the United States, will improve only when display and memory chip prices recover after the second quarter. 

 ?We expect a second-half improvement for Samsung, driven mainly by a pick-up in TFT-LCD prices,? said Yu Chang-eyun, technology analyst at BNP Paribas Peregrine, referring to liquid crystal displays (LCDs) used in televisions and computer screens.

 LCD prices slipped 5 per cent in the first quarter after plunging more than 40 per cent in the second half of 2004. Samsung said last month LCD prices would not recover until the fourth quarter, although analysts said they were seeing early signs of stability in 17-inch monitor prices due to growing demand.

 Analysts expect Samsung, the world?s biggest memory chip maker and third-largest mobile phone producer, to announce a net profit of 2.05 trillion won ($2.02 billion) for the first quarter to March.

 That would be down 35 per cent from 3.14 trillion won a year ago but up 12 per cent from the previous quarter?s 1.83 trillion won. Sales are expected to have risen 2 per cent to 14.1 trillion won from 14.4 trillion won a year ago.

 Samsung is forecast to earn 8.48 trillion won in net profits this year, down 21 per cent from record 10.79 trillion last year. LCD prices have crumbled because demand for expensive flat-screen TVs has failed to meet expectations of manufacturers, who are spending more than $40 billion to ramp up production over the next decade.

 Top rival LG Philips LCD Co reported its first quarterly loss in two years on Monday on falling prices. It forecast a rebound in the second half.

 ?We could have some price increase in monitor panels in the second quarter,? Credit Suisse First Boston said in a note to clients. ?However, sustainability is uncertain with rising capacity ramps in multiple players.?

 Few manufacturers are scaling back investment despite the current oversupply, although Taiwan producers such as AU Optronics Corp and Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp have slowed construction of new plants.

 In mobile phones, analysts expect Samsung?s profit margin to recover to 17 per cent in the first quarter from 3 per cent in the fourth on lower marketing expenses and stronger shipments.

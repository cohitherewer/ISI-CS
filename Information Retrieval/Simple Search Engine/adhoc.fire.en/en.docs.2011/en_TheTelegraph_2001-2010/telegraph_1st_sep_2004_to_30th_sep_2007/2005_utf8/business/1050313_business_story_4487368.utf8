 Wockhardt eyes US market for growth

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 Khorakiwala: Westward ho!

 New Delhi, March 12: After Ranbaxy, now Wockhardt has turned to the US market for growth. 

 The pharmaceutical major will focus on the US market, the company said. It has received the US authorities? approval to sell its over-the-counter (OTC) ulcer drug Farnotidine in the US market. 

 The approval is for selling the drug as 10-mg oral tablets for the treatment of stomach ulcer. The company had earlier received USFDA approvals for marketing Farnotidine 20 mg and 40 mg tablets ? both of which are prescription products. 

 ?We are expecting more approvals from the USFDA this year and are working towards increasing the share of revenue from the US, which is the largest pharmaceutical market in the world,? said Wockhardt chairman Habil Khorakiwala.

 Wockhardt plans to sell Farnotidine as a 10 mg OTC tablet in the US market from next month. The approval came through a few days ago. The company will sell the product through its subsidiary, Wockhardt USA Inc. 

 The approval of Farnotidine 10 mg OTC tablet will place the company in the entire product range with a combined market size of $135 million.

 At present, Wockhardt sells four products in the US market. These are Ranitidine, Enalapril, Bethanol Chloride and Captopril. 

 Ranbaxy has for long been focusing on this market for its growth and has received several USFDA approvals in the last few years. After the US, the European market is also increasingly gaining in importance for Ranbaxy and other Indian pharmaceutical companies. 

 Meanwhile, Wockhardt is concentrating on the diabetes segment in the domestic market. The company, which is into automatic insulin delivery devices, is planning to launch a biotech product in the first half of next year called Glargin, which is being touted as a long-standing insulin. 

 The long-standing insulin enhances the peak effectiveness rate of insulin. While an average insulin product will give a peak rate of eight hours, Glargin is likely to give the same effect for 24 hours, the company said.

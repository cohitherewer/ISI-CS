 Bangalore, June 7: The Goldman Sachs group plans to expand its India operations and increase headcount at itsBangalore centre three fold in the next five years.

 The investment bank has spent $30 million on the services centre, which has a capacity to seat 1,500 accountants, equity researchers, treasury staff and information technology professionals.

 The company plans to raise the staff strength to 800 by the year-end from 500 at present, said Edward Frost, chief administrative officer of at the New York-based company. 

 ?Though we have created a capacity to accommodate about 1500 people, our future hiring will depend on our global requirements and the cyclical nature of our business,? Frost said.

 ?We plan to ramp up the headcount by another 200-400 next year to 1000-1200 people. The domain expertise will be in finance, management and technology. We will touch 1,500 in five years,? he added.

 He said the facility will not support back-office operations. ?This is not a back-office facility. We are putting in a lot of money here,? he said.

 He said the company set up its centre in Bangalore because of the local talent pool, good technology infrastructure and an English-speaking population. ?In view of our global reputation and scale of activities, we have been able to attract the best talent in accounting, commerce, science, engineering and business management,? he said.

 David Simons, head of Goldman Sachs? Bangalore centre, said the nature of tasks and responsibilities handled by the Bangalore centre were no different from those at offices in New York, London, Hong Kong or Singapore.

 Regarding compensation and cost advantage of operating from India, Frost said the benefit to Goldman Sachs will be on a par with that of the IT services sector or about 40-50 per cent.

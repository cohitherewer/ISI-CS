 US telecom major to buy MBT stake

 High point

 Mumbai, Aug. 8: SBC Communications, the promoter of Cingular Wireless, will pick up a stake in telecom software maker Mahindra-British Telecom. 

 The deal will open up the multi-billion dollar US market for Mahindra-British Telecom, a subsidiary of Mahindra amp; Mahindra.

 The agreement envisages clearly defined milestones that SBC and Mahindra-British Telecom have to cross in the coming years. This will allow SBC Communications, which is set to become Americas biggest phone company by 2006, to pick up to an 8 per cent stake in MBT and a seat on its board.

 The alliance comes close on the heels of Cingular Wirelesss exit from India. The company has sold its stake in Idea Cellular to the Tatas and Birlas, the two Indian partners in Idea.

 MBT is the eighth-largest software exporter from India and is a joint venture between Mahindra and Mahindra and UK telecom services company British Telecom. Last year, it notched up a turnover of Rs 929.59 crore and a profit of Rs 71.09 crore. 

 Over the years, MBT has been trying to diversify its customer base without much success. However, foreign partner British Telecom contributes almost 78 per cent to its total revenue. 

 The MBT management team is committed to growth and improving profitability with a healthy mix of British Telecom and other clients, the company said. 

 In May 2005, SBC entered into an agreement with Mahindra-British Telecom Limited (MBT). The agreement establishes criteria for potential future options for SBC to invest in MBT. The agreement involves no immediate financial obligation for either company, MBT said in response to an email from The Telegraph.

 SBC has the option to obtain up to 8 per cent of MBTs equity over a five-year period in pre-defined increments, provided it meets the criteria outlined in the agreement.

 The arrangement also gives SBC the right to appoint a representative to MBTs board of directors, it said. The company, however, clarified that no SBC representative serves on the MBT board at present. 

 MBT has a commercial agreement with SBC to perform IT work, primarily focused on software and systems support for customer care, billing, network management and customer portal operations.

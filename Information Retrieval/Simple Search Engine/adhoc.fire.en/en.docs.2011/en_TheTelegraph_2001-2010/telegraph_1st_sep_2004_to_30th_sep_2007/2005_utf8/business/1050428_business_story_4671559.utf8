 India in top growth league: RBI report

 OUR BUREAU

 Mumbai, April 27: The country?s macroeconomic performance has turned out to be better than expected and it is now among the fastest-growing economies of the world in the medium term, says the Reserve Bank (RBI) in a report on macroeconomic and monetary developments.

 The uneven and erratic monsoon is a problem, but it could not hold back the real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, which will still be an impressive 6.9 per cent in 2004-05. The rise is smart even when it is measured against the base of 9.6 per cent in 2003-04, the report said.

 Real GDP for the farm and allied sector rose 1.1 per cent, said the report, which comes a day before the central bank unveils its biannual monetary and credit policy.

 The report says industrial recovery firmed up and broadened during the year, led by manufacturing and electricity, gas and water supply. Growth in these areas considerably mitigated the sluggish growth in agriculture.

 Real GDP from services continued to sustain the robust growth in 2003-04, said the report, which serves as a backdrop to the context and rationale of monetary policy.

 In spite of the slowdown in agriculture, the overall growth of GDP in 2004-05 was higher than the average rate attained over the preceding 12-year period, beginning 1992-93.

 On the fiscal front, the report lists the fiscal responsibility act as a major milestone that could change the way the government earns and spends its money. The deficit itself should come down to 4.3 per cent from 4.5 per cent in the previous financial year, though net borrowings by the government could shoot up.

 The report dwells on inflation too, saying the spike seen last year was largely the result of supply-side pressures. It picks the soaring prices of crude oil for special mention.

 On money supply, the report says the growth was 12.8 per cent, well within the 14 per cent range deemed healthy. 

 The foreign currency assets of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) increased by Rs 1,15,044 crore in 2004-05 against a rise of Rs 1,41,428 crore in the previous financial year.

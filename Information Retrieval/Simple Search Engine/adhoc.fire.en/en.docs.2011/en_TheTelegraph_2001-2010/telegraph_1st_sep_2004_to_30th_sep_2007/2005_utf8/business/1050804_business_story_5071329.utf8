 Calcutta, Aug. 3: The Mumbai rains have thrown the countrys exports out of gear, at least for the month of July.

 Commerce secretary S.N. Menon said extreme weather conditions had spelt trouble for the city, which is not only the commercial capital but also a major export point.

 I cannot say how much drop there will be in July, but certainly there has been an adverse effect, Menon said. 

 However, he expressed hope that the temporary blip would not thwart the export growth, which the government has set for itself this fiscal. 

 We are confident of attaining a 17 per cent growth this fiscal despite the July trouble, he said at the eastern region award presentation function of the Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC) here today.

 Exports stood at $80 billion at the end of 2004-05. In the first quarter of this year, exports grew on an average of 19-20 per cent.

 Last year, merchandise exports grew 24 per cent. The country has set the target of touching $150 billion exports in another five years.

 Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT) in Mumbai accounts for the largest chunk of container movement in the country. JNPT was affected due to water logging.

 Movement from Delhi inland container depot to Mumbai was withdrawn for a week. Moreover, goods worth crores of rupees were wasted in warehouses during the deluge.

 Menon said the government has received applications for 44 new special economic zones (SEZs) in different regions of the country.

 The proposals include 25 large SEZs, which would be set up on a plot over 1,000 hectares and have significant investment from large Indian companies.

 Besides, some steel complexes could turn into SEZs. Menon, however, refused to divulge details on the possible locations or investments in such projects.

 DEPB issues

 The commerce secretary said the trading communitys problems with the DEPB scheme have been taken up with the economic advisory council of the Prime Minister.

 The commerce ministry is also holding meetings with shipping and revenue secretaries and authorities of various major ports in the country to streamline procedures for boosting exports. The meeting at Calcutta port would be held in October.

 Menon also stressed on the application of electronic data interchange facilities at customs offices.

 EEPC chairman Rakesh Shah said the average export growth of engineering goods in the first quarter of this fiscal was about 20 per cent.

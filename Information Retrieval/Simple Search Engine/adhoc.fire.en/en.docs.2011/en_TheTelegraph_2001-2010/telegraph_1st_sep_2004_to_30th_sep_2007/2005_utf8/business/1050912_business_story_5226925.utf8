 Q amp;A

 Mutual gain

 If I invest in a mutual fund ELSS scheme this year, shall the amount invested be exempt under section 80C? What would be the tax liability on the dividend received in later years and the amount received on redemption of all the units after the three-year lock-in period?

 Bhaskar Ghosh, Calcutta

 Yes, the amount invested in an ELSS scheme up to Rs 1 lakh shall be exempt from tax under section 80C from this fiscal. Also, dividend received from equity mutual funds is exempt from tax. The capital gain made on redemption of the units after the lock-in period is also exempt from tax.

 Close to heart

 I had to undergo cardiac treatment, which included insertion of a special type of pacemaker which cost me Rs 1.9 lakh. Will this sum be deducted from my total income?

 S. K. Kar, Calcutta

 Deduction from total income is available for expenditure towards specified medical treatment. However, your treatment is not included among those specified in the income tax rules. Therefore, you cannot claim the deduction.

 Savvy housewife

 My husband is a government employee and an income tax assessee. I am a housewife without any income. However, I wish to invest in stocks. Can I compute income tax on capital gains as an individual assessee and submit return accordingly or is it essential to club my capital gains with my husbands income? Can I apply for PAN as an individual?

 Begum Anwara Khan, by e-mail

 Clubbing your income with your husband is not required in this case. You have to apply for an individual PAN and file your returns.

 Getting the facts right 

 I pay Rs 25,200 per annum towards tuition fees for my daughter who is pursuing B Tech. Can I claim exemption for the amount? My employer insists that the exemption allowed is up to Rs 12,000 per annum per child.

 Sipra Das, by e-mail

 Till 2004-05, there was a limit of Rs 12,000 per annum per child to claim income tax rebate for tuition fees paid. However, from this fiscal, the individual limit has been withdrawn and is now up to Rs 1 lakh under section 80C.

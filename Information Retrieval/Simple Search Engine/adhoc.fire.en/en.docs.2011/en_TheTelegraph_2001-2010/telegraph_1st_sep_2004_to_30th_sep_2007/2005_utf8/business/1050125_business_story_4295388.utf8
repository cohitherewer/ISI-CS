 RBI revises norms on loan classification 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 24: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has tightened the norms governing state government-guaranteed exposures. 

 It has delinked the requirement of invocation of state government guarantee for asset (loans) classification and provisioning.Banks are to subject them to the same norms as applicable to exposures not guaranteed by the state governments.

 At present, asset classification and provisioning for state government guaranteed exposures are linked to invocation of the guarantee.

 In a notification issued to banks last week, the RBI said this decision has been taken after reviewing the prudential norms pertaining to state government guaranteed exposures (advances and investments).

 However, to enable a smooth transition towards the new environment, RBI added that the revised prudential norms will be implemented in a phased manner.

 According to the RBI, with effect from the year ending March 31, 2006, state government guaranteed advance and investment in securities would attract asset classification and provisioning norms, if interest and/or principal or any other amount due to the bank remains overdue for more than 180 days.

 Further, with effect from the year ending March 31, 2007, state government guaranteed advance and investment in state government guaranteed securities would attract asset classification and provisioning norms, if interest and/or instalment of principal or any other amount due to the bank remains overdue for more than 90 days.

 The RBI has been frequently sensitising state governments on guarantees by pointing out that it could have an impact on their market borrowings. 

 The central bank has been stressing that state governments should honour the guarantees given by them. The RBI has also cautioned that states, which default in honouring the guarantees, could get fewer response when they approach the market for their borrowings.

 At present, assets are classified into four broad groups ? standard, sub-standard, doubtful and loss. 

 Meanwhile, the central bank has relaxed norms governing urban co-operative banks (UCB) undertaking insurance business as a corporate agent without risk participation. 

 The Reserve Bank had earlier allowed financially strong UCBs, having a minimum net worth of Rs 100 crore, to undertake this business. However, the central bank said it has now been decided to allow UCBs, having a minimum net worth of Rs 50 crore, to undertake insurance agency business without risk participation.

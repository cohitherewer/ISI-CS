 Chiria mines key to Bokaro strategy

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, June 16: Steel Authority of India Ltd is planning to utilise the rich iron-ore reserves of Chiria mines to raise the capacity of Bokaro Steel plant to 10 million tonnes. This would rival steel tycoon L. N. Mittals plans to set up a 10-million tonne mill at Chaibasa in Jharkhand. 

 We believe Bokaro has the potential to develop into a 10 MT steel-making plant, SAIL chairman V. S. Jain told The Telegraph in a telephonic interview.

 Following the decision to merge IISCO with SAIL, the state-owned steel major would use the 2-billion-tonne iron ore reserves of Chiria mines to develop the nearby steel plants. 

 Of course the Jharkhand government will have to be convinced to allow the renewal of Chirias lease, Jain said.

 Bokaro is one of Jharkhands largest industrial unit with a steel-making capacity of 3.5 MT. SAIL has already drawn up plans to increase this capacity to 6.5 MT within six years. 

 However, with Chiria landing on SAILs lap, it is reworking the expansion programme and may hike the capacity to 10 MT. This would also make Bokaro Steel the largest plant in SAILs fold. The company had earlier planned to give this status to Bhilai Steel plant with a 7 MT capacity by 2011. 

 At current LME prices, Chirias high-grade iron ore deposits, which are almost unused, have been valued at $250 billion.

 The mines have been leased about 70 years ago. The Jharkhand government wants to renew the leases in favour of private entrepreneurs, a move opposed by the Centre and SAIL. 

 Recently, SAIL sources claimed, senior Jharkhand government officials and foreign consultants (who were hired by other steel companies) had visited Chiria using a private helicopter. The team went back after it realised that SAIL was still in possession of the mines because of a court order, which allowed it to mine the area till a final decision is taken. 

 The central government is likely to impress upon the Jharkhand government that attempts to take back Chiria mines will only halt the development of Bokaro Steel into a giant plant employing nearly 10,000 workers. It would also hurt the state as Bokaro may die an early death due to lack of raw materials. 

 SAIL officials said Chiria mines would also supply ore to Rourkela and Durgapur plants, besides IISCOs Burnpur works. 

 Meanwhile, if Vizag Steel is merged with SAIL, then Vizag will turn into an export-oriented plant using imported iron ore.

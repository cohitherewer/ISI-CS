 Taking stock of the companys performance during 2004-05, managing director Juergen Schubert said the company is planning a water treatment business in India. We are exploring the various untapped businesses in the infrastructure sector and apart from power, water will be one of the focus areas, Schubert said.

 Siemens has been expanding the water extraction and treatment business after its US operations bought Filter Corp from French utility company Veolia Environnement in 2004. Siemens had paid $993 million for the US firm. With the acquisition of Filter, we have been expanding our business in water extraction and treatment, Schubert said. 

 Siemens India has lined up a capital expansion investment of Rs 300 crore for the current fiscal. It will invest Rs 150 crore in power, Rs 110 crore for consolidating its operations in the country and the remaining in automation.

 Banks for hybrid capital sops

 Mumbai, Nov. 27: Public sector banks, which are eagerly awaiting Reserve Bank of India (RBI) guidelines on raising capital through new instruments, want tax incentives bestowed on tools like hybrid capital to make them more effective.

 A host of nationalised banks led by the State Bank of India (SBI) are now planning to raise capital through such instruments. The urgency is greater in the case of those banks where government holding is close to the threshold level of 51 per cent as it restricts the quantum of equity capital that they can raise from the markets.

 There are 10 banks where the government holding is between 51 and 73 per cent. The Reserve Bank is now framing guidelines that will enable these banks to raise capital through hybrid instruments.

 Indian banks appetite for capital is expected to drastically increase over the next few years to meet the huge demand for credit. Moreover, the implementation of Basel II standards is also expected to exert pressure on capital requirements. While the Union finance minister P. Chidambaram expects that an additional Rs 60,000-crore capital might be required by banks over the next five years, JP Morgan feels that banks will need over Rs 55,200 crore.

 Hybrid capital combines characteristics of both debt and equity and it has been recognised by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) as a form of bank capital since 1988. According to the BIS guidelines, hybrid capital instruments can be a part of Tier I (through an instrument called Hybrid Tier 1) or Tier II (Upper Tier II). Tier I is a banks core capital whereas the latter is the supplementary capital that includes undisclosed reserves and subordinated debt.

 While preference shares or perpetual debt are the forms of Hybrid Tier I, Marc P. Jones, head of financial institutions group, Asia Pacific, JP Morgan, says the main characteristics of Hybrid Tier I are that they are perpetual and coupons here can be deferrable and non-cumulative.

 Even as the central bank is now in the process of framing detailed guidelines that will enable banks to raise capital through such innovative instruments, public sector banks, which are more keen on Hybrid Tier I, contend that their issuance without tax benefits would remove the zing from them. The State Bank is looking at raising Hybrid Tier I. However, the issue of tax deductibility is crucial for their success, says a senior bank official.

 Bankers, however, add that as it is not within the RBIs realm to announce tax benefits, they should take up the issue with the Central Board of Direct Taxes.

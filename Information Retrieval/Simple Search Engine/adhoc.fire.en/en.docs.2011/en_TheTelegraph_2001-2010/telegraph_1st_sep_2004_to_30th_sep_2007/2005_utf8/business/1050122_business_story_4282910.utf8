 Calcutta, Jan. 21: ITC Limited has reported a net profit of Rs 448.94 crore in the third quarter ? a rise of 17.67 per cent over the corresponding period of the previous year.

 The total income in the October-December period was Rs 1846.40 crore compared with Rs 1665.18 crore in the same period last year, a rise of 10.88 per cent.

 The company?s profit before tax has risen to Rs 638.70 crore from Rs 566.61 crore in the year-ago period.

 The earnings per share is Rs 18.10 at the end of the third quarter.

 The results of the company do not take into account the impact of the amalgamation of ITC Hotels and Ansal Hotels with itself. The company is awaiting approval from Calcutta High Court on the scheme of amalgamation.

 The company is expected to be the largest beneficiary of the Supreme Court ruling of January 20, which says that the state governments have no legislative competence to impose luxury tax on goods, including cigarettes, pan masalas and cigars.

 The company has not yet reacted to the Supreme Court order.

 In the notes to the accounts of the third-quarter results, the company said: ?On January 20, pronouncing its judgment on the company?s petition challenging luxury tax on cigarettes, the Supreme Court accepted the company?s contention and held that states do not possess legislative competence to impose luxury tax on goods. A copy of the judgment is awaited. The results do not take into account the effect of this judgment.?

 Incidentally, chairman Y. C. Deveshwar had been complaining about the high incidence of tax on cigarettes in the country.

 He argued that although cigarettes accounted for only 14 per cent of the total tobacco sale in the country, it contributed up to 85 per cent of tax to the government kitty under this head as there was virtually no tax on other products like bidi.

 After the Supreme Court judgment, the ITC share rose 11.08 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange and 11.16 per cent on the National Stock Exchange.

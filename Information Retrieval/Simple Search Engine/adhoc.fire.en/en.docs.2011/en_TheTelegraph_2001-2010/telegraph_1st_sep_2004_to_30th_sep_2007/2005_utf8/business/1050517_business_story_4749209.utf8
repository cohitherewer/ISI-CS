 Cibil plans commercial bureau

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 16: Credit Information Bureau India Ltd (Cibil) plans to launch a commercial bureau, which will collate data on the credit records of business enterprises, chief operating officer Arun Thukral said.

 We will try to launch a commercial bureau as soon as possible, Thukral said.

 Cibil will launch the bureau after it has a minimum of 3-4 lakh records on business enterprises, Thukral said.

 Cibil currently has a full-fledged consumer bureau of 20 million records. When it started operations last year, the credit information bureau had a database size of 4 million records from 12 members. It now has grown significantly to over 20 million from approximately 30 members.

 While Dun amp; Bradstreet was the technical partner providing knowledge for the consumer bureau, Thukral said the commercial bureau will be supported by Trans Union International.

 Bank of Baroda gets nod for offer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 14: Bank of Baroda (BoB) today said it has secured government approval for its second public issue.

 ?The Centre has conveyed its approval for our second public issue of 71 million shares at a premium to be decided soon,? the bank told exchanges. It had hinted at a Rs 1500-crore float in the first quarter of 2005-06.

 The Centre holds 67 per cent of BoB?s equity, institutions 23.62 per cent and the public 7.30 per cent. The rest is with private corporate bodies, NRIs and OCBs.

 In its public offer drive, BoB joins Punjab National Bank and Dena Bank, which entered the capital market with its second public issue of 8 crore shares earlier this fiscal in an issue that was oversold 11.5 times. 

 BoB will use the money raised from the offer to meet capital adequacy requirements and to augment the long-term resources. The issue comes at a time when the economy is buoyant and there is a huge demand for loans from firms and individuals. Banks also need more funds in their kitty to comply with the new Basel II norms that will kick in from March next year. Bank of India, Indian Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce and Indian Overseas Bank are among others planning offers.

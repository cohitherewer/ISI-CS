 Ore policy rejig to buoy steel firms

 Calcutta, Aug. 28: Domestic steel firms may soon have something to cheer about.

 The policy that empowers state governments to make discretionary allotment of iron ore mines may soon go.

 A committee set up by the steel ministry to formulate national guidelines for grant and approval of mining lease and licence of iron ore has recommended some sweeping changes in the policy.

 Its proposals are clearly in favour of captive users of iron ore ? steel plants ? than mining companies, which trade in ore.

 The focus of the committee was on a special provision (section 11.5) of the Mines and Mineral (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, which empowers state governments to make preferential allotment of reconnaissance permit, prospecting licence or mining lease to parties.

 Apart from SAIL and Tata Steel, none of the integrated players have captive mines. They have applied for leases but the iron-ore-rich states like Orissa, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh are playing hardball with prospective investors in the steel sector.

 They have created their own policies that give mining leases to companies which put up plants in those states. 

 Industry sources said states have distributed mining leases to many small players having no captive use, too.

 The committee, headed by former secretary R.K. Dang, said top priority should be given to existing integrated central or state public sector steel units like SAIL.

 Next on the priority list are existing public limited companies having a minimum capacity of 2 million tonnes each. Tata Steel, Ispat, Jindal and Essar will qualify in this bracket.

 Interestingly, the committee has recommended that no foreign partnership can be permitted in case iron ore reserve is located in a scheduled area. In such case, only one greenfield steel plant can be set up there and that too by a domestic public limited company. Most of the lucrative iron ore reserves ? Chiria in Jharkhand and Bastar in Chhattisgarh ? are located in scheduled areas only. If this suggestion is followed, Mittal Steel will have a tough time setting up a steel plant in Jharkhand using the Chiria mines.

 domestic non-steel companies, planning a foray into this sector, have been given the fourth preference for mining lease. However, the minimum size has to be 4 mt.

 In case of a foreign company, the proposed guideline said the minimum size should be 10 mt and 85 per cent of the project (excluding land) cost has to be brought as FDI but the project to be completed through an Indian company. 

 Going by this proposal, Mittal Steel, for instance, must float an Indian subsidiary and list that on Indian bourses.

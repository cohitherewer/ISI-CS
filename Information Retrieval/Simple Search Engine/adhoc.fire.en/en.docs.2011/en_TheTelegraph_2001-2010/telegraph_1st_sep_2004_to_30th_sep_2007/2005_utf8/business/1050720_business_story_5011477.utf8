 Ford profit drops 19%

 Still on track

 Detroit, July 19 (Reuters): Ford Motor on Tuesday reported a 19 per cent drop in second-quarter profit as it continued to lose vital US market share, but earnings were substantially higher than analysts expected.

 The second-largest US automaker, which has warned that its automotive operations may not be profitable this year, reported a loss for its automotive operations for the quarter as its credit arm continued to drive results. Ford affirmed its full-year earnings outlook.

 Fords second-quarter net income fell to $946 million, or 47 cents a share, from $1.17 billion, or 57 cents a share, a year earlier.

 Excluding special charges too, earnings were also 47 cents a share. On that basis, Wall Street analysts on average were expecting second-quarter earnings of 33 cents a share.

 Ford said charges related to a bailout of former parts subsidiary Visteon Corp and job reduction programmes reduced earnings per share by 18 cents. But the charges were fully offset by a one-time adjustment in the companys taxes.

 Revenue rose to $44.54 billion in the second quarter from $42.87 billion a year ago.

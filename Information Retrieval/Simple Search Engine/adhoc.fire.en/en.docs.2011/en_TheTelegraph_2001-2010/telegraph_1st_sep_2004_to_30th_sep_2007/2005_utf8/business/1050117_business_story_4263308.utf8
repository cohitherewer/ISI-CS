 Stocks cued to numbers

 SATISH JOHN

 Mumbai, Jan. 16: It?s report cards all the way for markets this week. Reliance Industries, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, IPCL, Reliance Energy, ICICI Bank and State Bank are among the companies that will reel off numbers.

 ?This is the time for a reality check and for a look at bottomlines,? said an analyst affiliated to a foreign brokerage. He, like many of his peers, feels the 21.3 per cent sensex surge in calendar 2004 has led to a general reflection in which investors are reassessing stock picks.

 The usual FII money that comes in during the first month of the year has not started streaming in. Three-fourths of the Rs 39,000 crore they invested last year arrived during the last four months of the year. Brokers expect the new cash to flow in spurts, but not on the scale of last year. However, they are confident Indian shares will remain attractive due to their low valuations and the robust growth rate of the economy so far.

 Construction companies could be a top draw, having posted their sharpest profit leaps in several quarters. Concrete gains are expected for cement, reinforced by a 7.8 per cent increase in prices, from Rs 140 to Rs 151 per bag. Telecom, auto and metals will witness good buying too.

 Banks will be in the spotlight with the likelihood that their interest income will be higher, depreciation lower and provisions made against bad loans on the decline.

 Analysts say the results of Infosys showed just how important the rupee is for companies with large exports. FMCG firms should attract attention if margins improve and input prices stabilise. Reliance group shares will move sideways for some time. Reliance Industries announces its third-quarter results on Friday. Analysts feel the firm will continue buying back shares to give its investors a sense of confidence.

 Calcutta, Oct. 19: Export and Import Bank of India (Exim Bank) is focusing on providing credit to domestic companies which are going for overseas acquisition.

 In 2004-05, the bank helped 12 domestic companies in overseas acquisitions by providing funds worth around Rs 550 crore.

 This year, we are targeting to provide Rs 750 crore for overseas acquisition. We have already offered Rs 350 crore to six companies in the current fiscal. There are six others in the pipeline in auto component, pharmaceutical and textile sectors. It will be a mix of debt and equity, Exim Bank executive director Srinivasan Sridhar said.

 A recent big deal funded by Exim Bank is the overseas acquisition by Crompton Greaves. The total cost of acquisition was $100 million and Exim Bank had provided $35 million.

 With more companies interested in going global, Exim Bank is organising a series of meetings on overseas investment opportunities next month in association with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (Miga) of the World Bank group.

 Miga provides political risk insurance products to private investors and companies investing abroad.

 Miga helps investors and lenders deal with political risks by insuring eligible projects against losses relating to currency transfer restrictions, expropriation, war and civil disturbance and breach of contract.

 Miga has launched a small investment programme, which is designed to support small and medium investors by offering a risk cover package.

 Small investors interested in going abroad for investment will benefit substantially under this programme.

 Exim Bank, through its links with multilateral agencies, financial institutions and trade promotion bodies, offers a range of information and advisory services to Indian companies investing abroad. 

 Srinivasan said Exim Bank has identified three areas where it will register 25 per cent growth. These are funded facilities, non-funded facilities and export line of credit. The corpus of funded facilities now stands at 11,500 crore and that of non-funded facilities at Rs 2,000 crore.

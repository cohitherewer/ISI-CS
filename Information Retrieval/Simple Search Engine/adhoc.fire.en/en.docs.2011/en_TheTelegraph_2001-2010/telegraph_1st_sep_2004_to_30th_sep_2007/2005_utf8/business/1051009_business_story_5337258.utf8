 Festive cheer eludes Darjeeling tea

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Cold brew

 Calcutta, Oct. 8: Prices of Darjeeling tea have slipped before the Pujas ? a time when the producers eagerly await a better rate realisation.

 According to tea traders and auctioneers, subdued enquiries from export markets ? Germany, the UK and Japan ? and an increase in production has dampened the prices.

 Every year, we see the prices firming up during the Pujas as Darjeeling tea is bought as gifts. Even those who stay abroad and come home for the festive season buy this variety. This year, however, the prices are down by Rs 4-6 per kg at the auctions, a Calcutta-based broker said.

 For example Darjeeling tea sold in sale 37 at the Calcutta auctions has fetched Rs 115.21 per kg on an average whereas the price was Rs 121.21 per kg in the same sale number last year. Similarly, the price in sale 38 was Rs 111.68 per kg compared with Rs 114.41 per kg in last years corresponding sale.

 We are worried over the fall in prices, said officials of Darjeeling Tea Association (erstwhile Darjeeling Planters Association) ? the apex body of the Darjeeling tea producers.

 A large amount of Darjeeling tea is sold privately. It is very difficult to find out what prices are offered at the private sales. The quality of tea also matters when it comes to price realisation, a senior official of Calcutta Tea Traders Association said.

 A comparison between the tea at sale number 38 of 2005 and 2004 shows that a larger amount of better quality tea was offered last year. In sale number 38 of 2005, nearly 40 per cent of the tea fetched Rs 150 per kg whereas this year only 16.21 per cent of tea fetched the same price.

 The Calcutta Tea Traders Association official also said an increase in production of a few lakh kg of Darjeeling tea also affects the prices. Production figures show that in the April to July period, 5.3 million kg of Darjeeling tea has been produced compared with 4.9 million kg in the corresponding period of the previous year. India produces 9.5 to 10 million kg of Darjeeling tea and the production figure has remained static for many years.

 Of the total production, less than 5 million kg of tea is offered in the auctions. Out of the 88 registered Darjeeling gardens, only 40 to 45 gardens send teas to the auctions throughout the year. The lower offerings in the auctions is because buyers have to make a payment within 14 days of tea offtake. Whereas, in the private sales, credit time is more.

 GE Shipping clears offshore demerger 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 15: Great Eastern Shipping Company today approved the de-merger of its offshore services business into a separate company called Great Offshore Limited.

 The offshore business consists of drilling services, marine logistics, marine construction and terminal services.

 Post-demerger, shareholders of GE Shipping will get one fully-paid share of Rs 10 each in Great Offshore for every five shares held in GE Shipping. Simultaneously, the shares held in GE Shipping will stand re-organised to four shares of Rs 10 each for every five shares held. 

 The new company would come into effect from April 1, 2005 through a high court-approved process.

 As part of the demerger, the total value of assets transferred to the offshore company is Rs 600 crore. The assets retained by GE Shipping include 18 offshore vessels, eleven harbour trucks and one construction barge, Great Offshore managing director Vijay Sheth said.

 The company has been vertically cut in two parts. Out of every 100 shares of GE Shipping, 80 will be of Shipping, while 20 of Offshore, both at Rs 10 each, Sheth said.

 The investments made by GE Shipping will be retained by the parent company, including the 20 per cent stake in Business Standard.

 Around 80 employees of Great Offshore will stay with the company, while 5-10 per cent additional recruitment could be done, Sheth said.

 The demerger share entitlement ratio has been suggested by Deloitte Haskins amp; Sells and Kalyaniwalla amp; Mistry. 

 Since all shareholders will be issued shares of Great Offshore on a proportionate basis, there will be no change in the overall shareholding pattern on the date the demerger becomes effective. 

 On the BSE today, the GE Shipping share touched an intra-day high of Rs 220 and later closed at Rs 211, surrendering Rs 3.80 from its previous close of Rs 214.80.

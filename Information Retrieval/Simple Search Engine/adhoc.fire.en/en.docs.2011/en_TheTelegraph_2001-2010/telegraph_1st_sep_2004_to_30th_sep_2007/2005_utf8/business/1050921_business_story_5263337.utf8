 Boeing expects big orders from China 

 Beijing, Sept. 20 (Reuters): Aersopace giant Boeing Co expects China will buy 2,600 commercial jet aircraft over the next two decades, underpinned by strong growth in domestic flights, company executives said today.

 That would quadruple Chinas fleet to more than 3,200 jets at an estimated cost of $213 billion at 2004 prices, Randy Baseler, Boeings vice-president of marketing for commercial aircraft, said.

 The Chicago-based company is betting that airlines, freed from regulations that encouraged the traditional hub-and-spoke system, are going to be buying smaller jets to provide direct flights between smaller cities.

 It thinks China will buy nearly 1,700 narrow-body planes, such as its 737 models or the A320 family made by European rival Airbus SAS. Airbus is controlled by European Aeronautic Defense amp; Space Co N.V., based in Germany and France. This market is going to continue to develop with more frequency and non-stops, not bigger airplanes, Baseler said, in a dig at Airbuss A380 superjumbo.

 Boeing expects Chinas domestic passenger market to grow at an average annual rate of 8.8 per cent over the next 20 years, while the cargo business would grow at a rate of 10 per cent, Baseler said.

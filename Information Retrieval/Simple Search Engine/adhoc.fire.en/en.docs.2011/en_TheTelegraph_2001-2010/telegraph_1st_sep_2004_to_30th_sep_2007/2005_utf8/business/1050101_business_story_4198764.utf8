 No easy pickings after quotas

 S. P. S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Dec. 31: The end of quota restrictions on textile exports from tomorrow will open the way for the most competitive developing countries to grab a bigger share of the $350-billion international market, but it is not going to be a cake walk.

 An Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) policy paper released this week states, ?Developing countries that can offer low-wage workers for sewing garments or seat covers together may have a comparative advantage over developed countries for that one stage of the assembly process. But that does not necessarily translate into a comparative advantage in the management of the entire supply chain when no export restrictions apply.?

 Countries that aspire to maintain an export-led strategy in textiles and clothing need to complement their cluster of expertise in manufacturing by developing their expertise in the higher value-added service segments of the supply chain such as design, sourcing or retail distribution, says the paper.

 In order to pursue these avenues, national suppliers need to place greater emphasis on education and training of services-related skills and to encourage the establishment of joint structures where domestic suppliers can share market knowledge and offer more integrated solutions to prospective buyers, it added.

 The paper also points out that the textile industry is undergoing a major re-orientation towards non-clothing applications known as technical textiles, which require expensive high-tech machinery and are currently concentrated in the developed countries.

 This category of products include bed sheets, filtration and abrasive materials, furniture and healthcare upholstery, thermal protection and blood-absorbing materials, seatbelts, adhesive tape and other such products. These technical textiles are growing roughly at twice the rate of clothing textiles and currently account for more than half of total textile production. 

 Weak infrastructure is expected to be a major problem area in countries like India. The congestion in the most modern domestic port ? JNPT ? only goes to highlight the fact that India?s best port is not good enough to meet the demands of international trade. Shortage of power is another infrastructure bottleneck that will pose a constraint in expanding capacity and meeting delivery deadlines.

 It is the infrastructure advantage that expected to enable India?s main competitor, China, to forge ahead to increase its market share in the world textile trade. 

 The Indian government is preparing a white paper to tackle the task of modernising the country?s textile industry, much of which is saddled with obsolete machinery. However, much will depend on the Indian entrepreneurs, who will have to gear up to take on world-class competition. 

 The fact that advanced countries impose much higher import tariffs on textiles than other goods only emphasises the fact that these nations are wary of the political fallout of opening the floodgates to cheaper foreign textiles at the cost of jobs at home.

 Non-tariff barriers such as social audits and issues such as child labour could prove to be major obstacles as the democratic governments put in place policies to protect their vote-banks.

 The formidable influence that the US steel industry wields over the policymakers in Washington when anti-dumping duties have to be imposed on steel imports is clear indicator on what could be in store in the textile sector as well.

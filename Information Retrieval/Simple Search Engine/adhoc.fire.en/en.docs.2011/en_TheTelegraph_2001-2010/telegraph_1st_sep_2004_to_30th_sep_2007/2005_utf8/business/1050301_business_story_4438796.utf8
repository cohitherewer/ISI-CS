The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 A tough balancing act

 S. P. S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: The 5 per cent reduction in customs duties from peak levels of 20 per cent to 15 per cent for bringing them in line with the southeast Asian levels is expected to cost the government Rs 3,168 crore. It expects to cover this up through increased service tax and excise collections.

 Finance minister P. Chidambarams direct tax proposals expect the increase in revenue to come from income and corporate tax collections, which are projected to go up by Rs 42,883 crore. The minister expects better tax compliance to yield the extra amount as the income-tax rates have been reduced.

 However, corporate tax collections during 2004-05 fell short of the targeted amount by a whopping Rs 5,436 crore and it remains to be seen whether things improve this time. The minister admits that the corporate tax collections should have been higher given the high rate of growth of the manufacturing sector.

 With the share of services increasing in the gross domestic product, the finance minister is keen to mop up larger revenue from this sector based on the general service tax of the advanced countries.

 However, as Chidambaram himself admitted today, the Indian mindset is yet to accept the fact that service tax is a legitimate and fair way for the government to raise revenues, considering that it is imposed on economic activity that creates value. The budget expects to mop up Rs 17,500 crore as service tax, which represents a 24 per cent rise over the corresponding figure of Rs 14,550 crore in the previous budget.

 This psychological hurdle appears to be coming in the way of fully realising the potential of this source of revenue.

 Political compulsions have also forced the government to increase the subsidy even as fiscal prudence and its own economic reform objective would have necessitated a reduction in these doles. As a result, the non-plan expenditure will go up Rs 3,70,847 crore next fiscal from Rs 3,68,404 crore in 2004-05.

 Chidmabaram?s budget has raised the provision for subsidies by nearly 9 per cent to Rs 47,432 crore in 2005-06 from the revised estimate of Rs 46,514 crore in 2004-05. 

 The social welfare measures spelt out in the common minimum programme to provide cheaper food and fuel to the poor and fertilisers to the farmers would not have been possible without this increase.

 The food subsidy, largely aimed at providing foodgrain to people below the poverty line at less than the market price, alone accounts for Rs 26,200 crore, more than 50 per cent of the subsidy bill proposed in the budget for 2005-06.

 Food subsidy was budgeted at Rs 25,800 crore in 2004-05 and the government expects to keep its spending within the target this fiscal.

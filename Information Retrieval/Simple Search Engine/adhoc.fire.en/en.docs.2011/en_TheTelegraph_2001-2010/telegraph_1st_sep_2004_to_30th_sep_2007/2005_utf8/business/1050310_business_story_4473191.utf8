 Fidelity tunes in to Saregama

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, March 9: Fidelity Investments has picked up a 5.26 per cent stake in Saregama India Limited. 

 Market sources said Fidelity Investments, one of the largest global investment bankers, had to shell out Rs 10 crore for the stake.

 ?In the last six months, Fidelity had picked up the stake at a price varying between Rs 70 and Rs 150,? brokers said.

 The exercise is part of Fidelity?s plan to pick up stakes in mid-cap companies in India.

 Foreign institutions will now hold 17.93 per cent in the RPG-controlled music and entertainment company.

 Over the last six months, FID Funds (Mauritius) has picked up 5.26 per cent in Saregama, Arisaig Partners (Asia Fund) has 3.99 per cent, Arisaig Partners (India fund) holds 3.21 per cent and Indiaman Fund (Mauritius) bought 0.21 per cent. 

 Saregama stocks have gained substantially in the last couple of months. The company has posted a profit of Rs 4.27 crore in the first nine months of the current fiscal against a loss of Rs 19.53 crore during the corresponding previous period.

 Analysts feel the company?s strategy of strengthening its core music business and also focusing on business opportunities in publishing, home video, digital downloads seems to have paid off.

 The company has also entered film production. It has recently entered into a strategic alliance with MGM Studios for marketing modern Hollywood films in India.

 The company will launch at least 100 MGM titles as video tapes over the next year. 

 The company has similar tie-ups with other Hollywood majors like Universal, Warner Bros and Paramount. As a result, the company has a monopoly in the international films segment.

 Saregama is coming out with a rights issue of Rs 45 per share, which will open by the end of this month. The company wants to raise Rs 24 crore through the issue. The proceeds will be utilised to retire high-cost debt and to expand its home-video business.

 The company?s stock has already become ex-right on the bourses and the prevailing price of Rs 120 has brought shareholders substantial capital appreciation.

 Indian Hotels net soars

 Mumbai, July 22 (PTI): Indian Hotels Co Ltds net profit zoomed to Rs 16.91 crore for the first quarter ended June 30 from Rs 6.40 crore in the year-ago quarter. The growth was aided by improved average room rates and occupancies coupled with higher income from food and beverages. 

 Income from operations increased 23 per cent to Rs 207.84 crore from Rs 168.86 crore last year due to a surge in tourist arrivals and growth in domestic travel.

 The improved performance was driven by an all-round growth in occupancies and average room rates at all key hotels of the company. The quarter also witnessed a robust growth in the food and beverage income, said Raymond Bickson, managing director of Indian Hotels.

 During the quarter, the company received requests from foreign currency convertible bond-holders for conversion of the bonds to equity aggregating $22.38 million.

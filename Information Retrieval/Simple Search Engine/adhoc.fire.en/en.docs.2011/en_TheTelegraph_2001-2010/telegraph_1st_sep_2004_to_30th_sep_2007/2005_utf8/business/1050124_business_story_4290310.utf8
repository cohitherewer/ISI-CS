The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Q amp;A

 I wish to take a personal loan. I receive some portion of my total income by way of cash. Will it be considered while calculating my loan eligibility?

 Himadri Sehgal, Jamshedpur

 ance companies do not consider any income by way of cash unless supporting documents for the same are produced. However, if the proof for cash income is produced by way of vouchers or a statement from the employer along with relevant entries in bank statements, it may consider part or full of such income.

 Travel kit

 Do I need to take travel insurance each time I make a trip or is one policy valid for trips made over a period of time?

 Preeti Modi, Calcutta

 The insurance companies offer various plans whereby you can either choose a single trip or multiple trip policy. The premium amount and the duration will vary depending on the policy you choose. 

 Hide-and-seek

 I often read about hidden costs included in repayment of loans. What are such costs?

 T. K. Sinha, Calcutta

 Normally, hidden costs include the fees charged towards processing and administrative fees, the increase in the effective rates of interest due to the annual reducing balance method, pre-payment charges, delayed payment charges and other such costs. Some institutions also charge legal and technical fees from customers, while others may include charges for stamp duty and registration of the mortgage deed.

 Mother to son

 I jointly held some shares with my husband. Now that he is no more, I wish to transfer the shares to my son. 

 Shikha Banerjee, Calcutta

 You will have to first transfer the shares in your own name by submitting a copy of the death certificate of your husband, along with the share certificates, to the registrar. Once that is done, you can submit the prescribed nomination form.

 JSW Steel debt-cut plan ready

 Balancing act

 Mumbai, Nov. 19: JSW Steel has decided to cut its debts. The company is planning to prepay close to Rs 450 crore to banks and financial institutions by the end of this fiscal.

 The company had prepayed close to Rs 540 crore in the first six months of this fiscal, said director (finance) Seshagiri Rao. Therefore, the forthcoming payment will bring down the debt levels by around Rs 1,000 crore by March 31, 2006.

 The company is also focused on its expansion plan and a gigantic Jharkhand project, which is expected to produce 20 million tonnes of steel by 2012.

 As the expansion project is being funded by a combination of debt and equity, the total debt of the company is expected to touch over Rs 4,000 crore by the end of this fiscal, up from Rs 3,700 crore last year. 

 JSW Steel will raise its capacity to 7 million tonnes by 2008 to capitalise on the emerging steel scenario. 

 The expansion will entail a capital expenditure of Rs 5,000 crore, of which Rs 3,000 crore will be borrowed from the international or domestic market. The rest is expected to come from cash accruals, rights/public issue or an overseas issue.

 Company sources said while the expansion programme will come at a debt-equity ratio of 1.5:1, JSW Steel has taken a conscious decision to maintain the figure at 1:1. 

 For specific projects, it may be over 1:1, but for the company as a whole, the objective is to see that the ratio does not exceed 1:1. This will come from frequent debt pre-payments. At present, the ratio is put at 1.08:1. But after the pre-payments, the ratio at the end of March 31, 2006, will be below 1:1, the sources added.

 JSW Steel feels such procedures will enable it to achieve a strong balancesheet, which can be leveraged further to raise money at attractive rates of interest. 

 For the current expansion project, the domestic funds are expected to come at an interest rate of around 8 per cent.

 During 2004-05, the company had made repayment and pre-payments from internal accruals to the tune of Rs 1,079 crore. 

 The company also refinanced high- cost debt by raising low-cost debt with varying maturity profiles, aggregating Rs 1,553 crore. This resulted in the average cost of debt coming down to 8.27 per cent from 9.42 per cent. 

 These initiatives followed a realisation in the company that a large high-cost debt had stunted its competitive low operating cost edge.

 Birlas file new caveats in high court

 Calcutta, July 3 (PTI): The Birlas have filed two more caveats before the Calcutta High Court to strengthen their position against Rajendra S. Lodha in the MP Birla assets case. 

 The caveats challenged Lodhas probate application seeking authentication of Priyamvada Birlas 1999 will.

 Kashinath Tapuria and Pradip Kumar Khaitan have filed applications for being included as parties in the probate petition, N.G. Khaitan of the Birla groups solicitor firm said.

 Both Tapuria and Khaitan were the executors of the 1982 mutual wills of M.P. Birla and his wife Priyamvada, and as such they have interest in the probate proceedings of the 1999 will of Priyamvada, he said.

 Kashinath Tapuria is Priyamvadas brother and Pradip Khaitan is a partner of solicitor firm Khaitan amp; Co.

 Earlier, the high court had admitted G. P. Birlas caveat in the case, but it had rejected the caveats of K.K. Birla, B.K. Birla and Yash Birla.

 G.P. Birla was the executor of Priyamvadas 1982 will. Along side him, the Birlas decided to field Tapuria and Khaitan in the fray, as they were also executors of Priyamvadas and M. P. Birlas testament of 1982 ? the mutual wills.

 N.G. Khaitan said, Justice Kalyan Jyoti Sengupta of the high court is likely to take up the caveats of Tapuria and Khaitan very soon.

 Lodha has to contend with the opposition of G.P. Birla, Radha Devi Mohta, and the four others who substituted late Laxmi Devi Newar.

 Justice Sengupta had last week allowed the Birlas application for substitution of the name of Laxmi Devi with that of her sons, Ajay Newar and Arvind Newar, besides solicitor N.G. Khaitan and family-friend Deven Mantri.

 Wipro bets on Andhra centres

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Oct. 20: Wipro Technologies plans to provide 7000 more jobs in the next 36 months at its development centres in Andhra Pradesh, vice-president B. Krishnamurthy said on Thursday. Wipro plans to invest Rs 150 crore in both Hyderabad and Vishakapatnam to develop IT infrastructure for its business propositions, said Krishnamurthy. 

 Krishnamurthy today signed a memorandum of understanding with the state for allotment of 107 acres, including seven acres, in Vishakapatnam. 

 Chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy had requested Wipro chairman Azim Premji to speed up work at the two centres. State IT secretary K. Ratna Prabha said the AP government was attracting investments in the IT and ITeS sectors by allocating land to major players. 

 We have a 30-per cent cost advantage for locating ICT units in the state, she said. 

 Wipro functions from a development centre spread over 30 acres in Hyderabad, besides its operations in Bangalore.

 K. Veeresh, director in the ICT department, said Wipro would get its BPO arm, Spectramind, to open a centre in Hyderabad. Its presence is now limited to Bangalore, Calcutta and Delhi.

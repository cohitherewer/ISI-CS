 New Delhi, April 5: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said growth in the Tenth Plan ?is not likely to? cross the 7-per-cent mark. The growth target was set at 8.1 per cent.

 Blaming lower farm sector growth, Singh said at a meeting of the full Planning Commission that the government needed to step up agriculture growth through more investments and promote private initiatives in education and health, besides infrastructure. 

 Plan panel deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia later told newspersons that the Prime Minister had asked the government to work out a plan to step up farm growth to 4 per cent. ?The economy grew only by 6.5 per cent during the first three years of the Tenth Plan period... Even if we perform very well in the next two years, overall annual growth is unlikely to be more than 7 per cent ... the agricultural side of the economy has to perk up,? he said.

 The three-hour meet was held to approve the mid-term appraisal of the Tenth Plan, a document which will be now be passed by the cabinet and then placed before the National Development Council. 

 Ahluwalia said the plan panel, comprising professional economists and senior cabinet ministers, also took note of the global ?oil price scenario, which is likely to remain firm?, but added that this has not yet been factored into the growth projections.

 He indicated that if high prices continued, domestic rates could also harden. Many economists feel that if oil prices continue to rise, the government may have to revise the GDP growth estimates accordingly.

 Ahluwalia said the panel had recommended the continuation of the policy of dereservation of the small-scale industry and FDI in new areas such as retail. ?If you want to develop backward linkages in the production and supply chain, development of retail is a must ... we have only to see the Chinese example,? he added.

 Foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail has been strongly opposed by the Left. Ahluwalia?s reference to the Chinese model was seen by some as an answer to the Left leaders? arguments against opening up the sector.

 The mid-term appraisal has sought a number of industrial reform initiatives and liberalisation of certain sectors.

 It has also asked the government to rationalise an inverted duty structure on a large numbers of imports, where free trade pacts have reduced duties on finished products, leaving the levy on inputs at higher levels.

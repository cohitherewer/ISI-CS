 Calcutta, April 23: The government needs to make changes in the trade policy to help exporters grab 2 per cent of global trade by 2009. 

 At present, exports stand at $80 billion and will have to go up to $150 billion to meet the target.

 Speaking at a seminar ? New imperatives for stimulating export growth ? organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce, S Narayanan, former secretary in the finance ministry, said: ?The government should ensure that procedural delays are minimised. It is also necessary to establish a communication link between the customs department and DGFT (director-general of foreign trade) to ensure that export activities are carried out smoothly.?

 ?The two major objectives of the foreign trade policy are to double the percentage share of global merchandise trade within the next five years and to act as an effective instrument of economic growth by pushing employment generation. This can be achieved through transparency, simpler procedures and lower transaction costs, and by neutralising the incidence of all levies and duties on inputs used in export production,? said P. R. Agarwala, senior vice-president of Bharat Chamber of Commerce. 

 Narayanan added that the government should provide good infrastructure facilities in the special economic zones.

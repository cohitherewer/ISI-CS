 Cairn tiff before lawyers

 New Delhi, Jan. 4 (PTI): The petroleum ministry has sought legal advice on payment of a production tax by Cairn Energy of the UK on the crude oil it plans to produce from the discovery in Barmer district of Rajasthan.

 ?Cairn Energy signed a contract for the Rajasthan block that did not specify who (Cairn ? the operator of the field, or Oil and Natural Gas Corp ? the licensee) will pay the statutory levy. Now that is to be settled legally. So, we have sought legal opinion and are awaiting clarification on the issue,? petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar told reporters here.

 The British company, which plans to produce 80,000 to 100,000 barrels per day from its Mangala and Aishwariya fields in Rajasthan, has protested against the levying of a cess of Rs 900 on every tonne of crude oil produced from the fields.

 Cairn says the Rajasthan block is a pre-Nelp (new exploration licensing policy) block where ONGC, as the licensee, was made responsible for the payment of all statutory levies like royalty and cess.

 Petroleum secretary S. C. Tripathi said while the production sharing contract for the Rajasthan block had clearly mentioned that royalty will be paid by ONGC, it does not mention anything on payment of production cess.

 ?Naturally, the cess is to be paid by producers. Cairn and ONGC are partnering in Mangala and Aishwariya fields and they will have to pay the cess in proportion of their shareholding,? he said.

 ONGC had late last month exercised its ?walk-in? rights to take a 30 per cent stake in the two fields Cairn plans to put on production.

 Tripathi said ONGC has disputed the payment of statutory levies like royalty on behalf of private sector partners in pre-Nelp blocks like Cairn?s RJ-ON-90/1 block in Rajasthan.

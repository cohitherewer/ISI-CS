 Nath talks tough on farm trade

 New Delhi, July 20: Union commerce minister Kamal Nath today said the government would not go beyond a point to open up the market in agriculture in the WTO talks unless developed countries agree to make farm trade fair to all by dismantling subsidies.

 He was addressing the valedictory session of the pre-Hong Kong ministerial stakeholder workshop on agriculture negotiations here.

 The advanced countries must end export subsidies and substantially reduce domestic support to their farm sector, he said. 

 These steps must precede market access into developing countries and not the other way round, he added.

 The minister said the European Union had indicated at the recent mini-ministerial at Dalian in China that they would undertake the steepest cuts in their domestic support to agriculture provided the US and Japan accept to undertake second order cuts. 

 We support this view and the G-20 has come out with a concrete proposal on this. It proposes a standstill in export subsidies, coupled with front-loading of elimination commitments, so that the more obvious forms of distorting policies are completely eliminated by 2010, Nath said. 

 The developing countries commitments to market access would have to be subject to alleviating poverty, promoting rural development, safeguarding the livelihood of the people and food security. These are central to these nations economic growth.

 This is an integral part of the July 2004 framework. Therefore, it is essential that developing countries like India is given sufficient policy space and flexibility in instruments. It is towards this end, we have succeeded in revitalising the G-33 coalition on special products and the special safeguard mechanism, he added. 

 The minister pointed out that developed countries are increasingly creating non-tariff barriers to deny market access to developing nations, especially in agriculture. There can be no trade-off between agriculture, industrial tariffs and services as they form three different pillars at the WTO.

 Calcutta, Aug. 13: Another home-grown brand was added to the market of personal computers today as Lok Sabha speaker Somnath Chatterjee and Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee formally launched a range of computers from R. P. Info Systems. 

 ?We have done well in software, but we have always been dependent on foreign companies for hardware. It is good news that local entrepreneurs are now trying to make personal computers,? Bhattacharjee said after launching Chirag computers. 

 Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya and MPs Md Salim and Sujan Chakraborty were also present at the ceremony, where everyone talked about how the knowledge economy is changing the young generation?s approach to entrepreneurship. 

 ?People used to say that people of Bengal lack enterprising skills, but things are changing today. The young generation is doing a lot of things here and setting precedence for others to follow,? said Chatterjee. 

 Promoted by first generation entrepreneurs Shibaji Panja and Kaustuv Roy, the company will sell its four varieties ? Scholar, Pro, Magic and Aladin ? of computers, priced between Rs 14,500 and Rs 24,500, using its own distribution channel. To begin with, the company will have 26 outlets to sell computers and provide after-sales and support services. 

 The computers are getting assembled at the company?s plant in Howrah, where it has a capacity of assembling around 100 computers a day. It has a workforce of around 150 technical people. 

 ?We have invested around Rs 26 crore. Though there are cheap brands available in the market, our sales pitch will be quality, three-year warranty and service. We expect to touch Rs 100 crore sales figure by March 2006,? said Panja. 

 From selling various hardware and computer peripherals to assembling computers, R. P. Info Systems is in the industry for the past five years. 

 The promoters expect that PC sales would contribute to around 50 per cent of the company?s top-line. Besides increasing the number of outlets in the coming months and expanding the scope of coverage area, the company also has plans to launch laptops by November and introduce Bengali interface to facilitate computer literacy in the state.

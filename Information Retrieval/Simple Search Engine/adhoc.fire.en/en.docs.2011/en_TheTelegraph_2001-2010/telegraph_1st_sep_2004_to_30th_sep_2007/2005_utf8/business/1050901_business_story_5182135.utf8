 Posco sets up India office

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Aug. 31: Korean steel company Posco has set up its Indian subsidiary, Posco India, here. The firm has been registered under the Companies Act, 1956 with the Registrar of Companies, Orissa.

 In June, Posco had signed an agreement with the Orissa government for setting up a Rs 51,000-crore steel project at Paradip.

 Soung-Sik Cho, senior executive vice-president of Posco, has been given the additional charge as managing director of the India subsidiary. He will operate from Korea. 

 Deputy managing director Tae-hyun Jeong will be based in Orissa. He would control and operate Poscos Orissa operations. 

 Posco will man India operations with about 80 people. Of this, 50 are Koreans who would function from Korea. It will recruit 30 people in India within this year. 

 In the first phase, between 2007 and 2010, Posco will invest $1.2 billion for the 3-million tonne steel plant it is building in Orissa. It will later expand the steel-making capacity to 12 million tonnes.

 Jeong said the immediate priorities for Posco are resettlement and rehabilitation, mine development and the successful completion of the feasibility report.

 By November, the company plans to complete the detailed study on water, rail, road, electricity and other related issues. 

 Orissa is set to benefit once the Posco project becomes functional. It is expected to create 48,000 jobs.

 Posco is outsourcing some of the work to Indian companies including, soil and penetration test, minor port development plan, water supply plan, environmental impact analysis, township planning, basic mining master plan and basic railway plan.

 Mecon has already completed the site selection study. In order to study Indias economic trends and growth in sectors like shipbuilding and construction, the company has opened Posco Research Institute in New Delhi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Steel prices head north again

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 1: Bucking the downward trend of the last three months, steel majors have raised prices by Rs 500-1000 a tonne. Global steel rates have started hardening in the last one month.

 Benchmark hot-rolled coil prices will now stand at an average of Rs 23,500 to Rs 24,000 a tonne in the country.

 The industry was expecting a steeper rise of about Rs 1,500 a tonne. But the raise is seen as cautious step.

 We are testing the waters. Let us get a feedback from customers. There could be some more hikes this year, a steel industry executive said.

 In keeping with the global rates, which are showing an upward trend, we have decided to raise the price across the products range by Rs 500 per tonne, a SAIL spokesman said.

 Tata Steel and Ispat raised spot prices by Rs 500 a tonne, while Essar increased it by Rs 500-700 a tonne.

 Hot-rolled coil prices have gone down by Rs 5,000 a tonne in the last three months from a peak of Rs 29,000 crore.

 High inventory coupled with cheap imports from the CIS countries had forced the reduction in prices.

 There was an 84 per cent rise in steel imports in the first quarter of this year.

 The cycle turned for the better from August when demand picked up and inventory got depleted. Buyers waiting to cash in on the falling market started picking up stocks again.

 Imports from CIS countries also got costlier. Indian steel makers were most aggrieved by cheap import from these countries. The Indian Steel Alliance, a body of steel majors, has sought duty protection by increasing duty from 5 to 15 per cent. However, the government has turned down the proposal. 

 Indian prices are fixed in tandem with the landed price of import. Prices in the US and EU started hardening from July end. The effect is being felt here now, a steel industry executive said.

 World Steel Dynamics had predicted a turnaround in prices in a report in August.

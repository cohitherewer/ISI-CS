The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 LPG hike on front burner 

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Moving up

 New Delhi, Aug. 29: The government may have to increase the price of domestic cooking gas as the rates of the Indian basket of crude imports has shot up to an unprecedented $62 per barrel this month. It had earlier planned increases in the rates of petrol and diesel only. 

 Worried over the fast deteriorating situation, petroleum ministry officials held discussions with their finance ministry counterparts today to work on ways to ease the burden on state-run oil companies and help them cushion the blow for consumers. The discussion is a follow-up of the earlier meeting in the PMO on the issue. 

 Senior petroleum ministry officials told The Telegraph that the losses on LPG and kerosene sales are much higher than those on petrol and diesel. 

 While the prices of the two transport fuels have been increased in recent months, the two cooking fuels have been left untouched. 

 Although the oil companies are losing Rs 11 per litre on kerosene, the fact that it is considered a poor man?s fuel makes it politically difficult for the government to raise its price by too large an amount. In fact, they remain frozen since March 2002. 

 LPG, however, is used by the relatively better off sections and given the fact that the national oil companies are losing over Rs 100 per cylinder on the cooking gas, an increase in its price cannot be ruled out. The price of LPG was increased by Rs 20 per cylinder in November 2004 and a similar hike seems to be on the cards this time as well.

 Senior officials are of the view that it would be easier for the consumers to reconcile to an increase in the price of LPG now as there is sufficient awareness that international prices have touched an all-time high.

 Petroleum secretary S.C. Tripathi has informed the PMO that all the public sector oil marketing companies have plunged into the red and if the current trend continues, they will turn sick. These companies also need around Rs 13,500 crore to meet their capital expenditure requirements during the current fiscal. 

 Given the political compulsions of the government, the bureaucrats have been clearly told that there can only be a moderate increase in the prices of petrol and diesel prices.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Singh suggests survival steps

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 12: The economist in Prime Minister Manmohan Singh took a backseat today as he put on the hat of a management guru, suggesting to business leaders survival steps in a competitive global business environment. 

 ?The era of incrementalism is over ? The challenge before us is to think out of the box. We must think anew, afresh and ahead,? said Singh while addressing the representatives of India Inc and their global counterparts during the inaugural session of Partnership Summit 2005. 

 At the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) forum, he also announced the government?s decision to set up of a national knowledge commission to prepare the country to meet the challenges of 21st century

 He said such a commission would strengthen the ?roots and sinews? of the country?s capacity and capability building. 

 ?This commission would be a catalyst in setting ambitious knowledge targets and enabling agencies to attain them,? said Singh.

 Setting the agenda for the commission, he identified the five areas of action ? to increase access to knowledge for public benefit, develop new concepts for higher education, rejuvenate science and technology institutions, enable application of knowledge by industry to enhance manufacturing competitiveness and encourage intensive use of knowledge-based services by government to empower citizens. 

 ?We must make our universities world class and centres of innovation and excellence,? said Singh stressing the importance of knowledge to develop new products and services and to increase productivity in industries. 

 He, however, did not restrict himself to the private sector and added that the government and its agencies should also improve their services through the use of information technology. 

 But keeping the equity motto intact, the Prime Minister reminded that knowledge must be used to empower the disempowered.

 Maran: New horizons

 Chennai, Oct. 23: The government has urged domestic infotech companies to take full advantage of the synergies between automobile and IT industries.

 The overall electronics components in the high-end automobiles have gone up to 40 per cent, Union communications and IT minister Dayanidhi Maran said while inaugurating a three-day conference on International Mobility Engineering Congress And Exposition 2005 in Chennai to mark the centenary of the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).

 The vehicles? improved performance, safety and comfort, besides security features, have become possible largely due to embedded electronic control units (ECU), Maran said. With competitive pressure, customer demand and regulations, the use of electronics was only likely to go up in future, he added.

 While domestic IT firms have developed complex software for MNCs, the intellectual property rights (IPRs), however, remained with the multinational original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and global frontline suppliers, Maran said. Therefore, to be competitive, Indian OEMs and component manufacturers need to develop their own IPR,? Maran added.

 Maran said the IT sector can synergise with the automobile sector in developing ECUs for two and three-wheelers, trucks and buses to suit Indian road and market conditions. 

 Application of ?telematics? in the automobile industry was another area of opportunity, Maran said. The minister mooted a ?consortium approach? by the industry and asked researchers to come up with models for telematics applications. 

 Marcel Lejeune, CEO and executive vice-president, Siemens VDO Automotive AG, said Germany had a ?clear commitment? to the Indian automotive business.

 SAE international president, Ted Robertson said in the next 25 years, India had the potential to emerge as the ?third largest car maker in the world?, citing a report by Goldman Sachs.

 Former Maruti chief V. Krishnamurthy said in the coming years, the automotive sector would be the ?fastest growth sector? in manufacturing.

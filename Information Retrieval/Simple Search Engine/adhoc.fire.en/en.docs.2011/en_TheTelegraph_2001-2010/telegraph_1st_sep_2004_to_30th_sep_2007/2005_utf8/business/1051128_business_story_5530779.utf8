 New Delhi, Nov. 27: The Planning Commission today said the constraints of coalition politics could make it difficult for the country to achieve a 10 per cent growth rate.

 It is tempting to go for a double-digit growth. But with coalition politics, it looks hugely difficult, Planning Commission deputy chairperson Montek Singh Ahluwalia told the India Economic Summit.

 Observers saw this as a comment on the contradictions between the Congress-led government and its Left partners over liberalising certain sectors of the economy.

 He, however, did not undermine the 8 per cent growth target, although not many people seem to be impressed by such a growth.

 Coalition politics is consistent with an 8 per cent growth. Policy requirement for this kind of growth is huge. It is not only change in policies but we also need to see if they are delivered properly. As of now, we have a lot to do to achieve this growth rate, Ahluwalia said.

 During the Eleventh Plan period, the commission will make an effort to incorporate changes, which would indicate the consequences of not implementing certain developmental programmes mentioned in the plans, he added.

 The pace of growth had slackened after the first round of reforms in the 1990s. In mid-1990s, the growth rate averaged between 5.6 and 5.8 per cent and with the turn of this millennium, it averaged around 6.5 per cent, Ahluwalia said. 

 The current year will be good. However, to achieve the targeted growth rate of 7-8 per cent, the government will have to focus on improving infrastructure, education and health.

 The deputy chairman said sectoral reforms are key to infrastructure development. The government has laid out an agenda for public-private partnership. A lot of learning is going on. In the beginning, we may not have got all of it right, but now we are trying to make adjustments.

 He also said the model concession agreement prepared by the government would resolve many issues, including the issue of risk sharing in a public-private partnership project.

 The commission will not settle for anything less than full funding of flagship projects like Bharat Nirman, the National Rural Employment Programme and Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan.

 The funds should be allocated to priority areas, Ahluwalia said on the sidelines of the conference.

 Talking about the democratic process, Ahluwalia said though it may appear to be taking time for a consensus on critical issues, the heated debates actually help avoid committing too many mistakes in the long run.

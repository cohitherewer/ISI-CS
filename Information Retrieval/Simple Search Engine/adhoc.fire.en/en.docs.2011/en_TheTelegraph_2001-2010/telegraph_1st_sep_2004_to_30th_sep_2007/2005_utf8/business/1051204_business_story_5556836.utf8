 Mittal Steel ups stake in African unit

 Johannesburg, Dec. 3 (Reuters): The worlds largest steel maker Mittal Steel Co. has raised its stake in its South African unit, Mittal Steel SA, to 52 per cent from 50 per cent earlier, but said on Friday it had no immediate plans to delist the stock.

 The New York- and Amsterdam-listed parent company bought 9 million shares worth 460 million rand ($71.23 million) on November 24 in Mittal Steel South Africa, the continents biggest steel maker.

 The purchase ... raises the shareholding by the parent company to 52 per cent from just over 50 per cent, Nicola Davidson, head of Mittal Steels corporate communications, told Reuters from London.

 Mittal Steel has been increasing its stake in Mittal Steel South Africa gradually since 2001. This does not in any way signify any interest from Mittal Steel to take its interest over 60 per cent or make an offer to minorities, the company said in a statement.

 The shares were purchased from Deutsche Bank, it added.

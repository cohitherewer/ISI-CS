 Purnendu stands between IOC, Haldia

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Aug. 2: Confusion and uncertainty over Indian Oils move to buy shares of Haldia Petrochemicals refuse to die down with Purnendu Chatterjee raising questions over the price at which the PSU oil company is being offered the 7.5 per cent stake in the petrochemicals firm.

 Indian Oil, which has already paid Rs 150 crore for the proposed stake, is now waiting for the company to encash the cheque and allot it the shares.

 Purnendu ? who met Bengal chief secretary Amitkiran Deb and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen at ITC Sonar Bangla last Sunday to seek more time to acquire the governments 36.87 per cent stake ? has asked why IOC will be given shares at par (Rs 10) whereas he has to shell out Rs 29 for each share of HPL.

 Sources in The Chatterjee Group said when the HPL board approved Indian Oils contribution of Rs 150 crore and accepted the cheque, the share price was not calculated. Later when the Bengal government decided to offer its stake to TCG, it appointed L.B. Jha to carry out a valuation and the share price was fixed around Rs 30.

 Though the state government is gearing up to issue shares to IOC, it will have to take the consent of the TCG chief. As things stand now, Purnendu will not allow Haldia Petrochemicals to issue shares to IOC at Rs 10. The last date of encashing the IOC cheque is August 18.

 If IOC is offered Rs 29 per share, it will get a meagre 2.5?3 per cent stake in HPL. A company, which was keen to acquire the management control a couple of years ago, may not be enthused about such a paltry stake.

 Writers Buildings sources said the government might carry out a fresh valuation of the shares of HPL. The company had registered a net profit of Rs 750 crore in 2004-05. The first quarter had been quite good for the company and the trend is expected to continue throughout the year, HPL officials said. The robust result should get reflected in the share price, they felt.

 Senior IOC officials said though there was no formal communication from the state government, they had learnt that the cheque would be encashed shortly.

 Though HPL officials were mum about a possible board meeting before August 18, Sabyasachi Sen had earlier hinted of such a possibility.

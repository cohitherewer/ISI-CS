 Utilities likely to get Dabhol power at Rs 2

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New turn

 New Delhi, May 31: Dabhol Power is likely to offer electricity at Rs 2 per unit to transmission companies once the plant restarts by August. Domestic users may have to fork out between Rs 2.10 and Rs 2.50 per unit for the power. 

 National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) has agreed to restart the Enron-built power plant and manage the company on behalf of stakeholders. 

 Gail (India) Ltd and NTPC will form a special purpose vehicle (SPV) to run the plant. The project is likely to become operational by July-August.

 Union power minister P. M. Sayeed today confirmed that a final solution to the project has been reached. We are in sight of a solution and there is no deadlock now.

 Sources in the power ministry said the project would start by July. The financial and operational hurdles have been cleared by the empowered group of ministers. The necessary agreements could be signed either this week or next.

 They said differences between promoters GE and Bechtel as well as with Indian financial institutions, which have over Rs 5,000-crore exposure in the project, have been resolved. Indian creditors include IDBI, ICICI, State Bank of India and Canara Bank.

 Foreign promoters GE and Bechtel had filed a $6-billion claim at the International Court of Arbitration in London for alleged breach of bilateral investment protection agreement.

 This has been resolved. They have in-principle agreed to withdraw the case. We are awaiting a written response from them, said sources in the ministry.

 On Monday, GE had said it would join NTPC and Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd to restart the project. GE and Bechtel hold an 85 per cent stake in Dabhol Power.

 Phase I of the project would generate 740 MW. Initially, it was to use naphtha as a fuel, but later switched to liquified natural gas. Phase II would generate 1,444 MW and use LNG to be supplied by Gail.

 Recently, the government had won the Union cabinets approval to stand as a guarantor to domestic financial institutions for settling the foreign debts of the power company.

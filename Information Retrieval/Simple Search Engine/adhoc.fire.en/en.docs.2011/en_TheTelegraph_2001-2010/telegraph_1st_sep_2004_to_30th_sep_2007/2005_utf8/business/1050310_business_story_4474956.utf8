 Mid-air collision on fee structure

 New Delhi, March 9: Travel agents and foreign airlines are squaring off again for another showdown ? and that could spell trouble for people planning to fly abroad later this summer. 

 Foreign airlines like British Airways and Lufthansa have revived plans to slash the commission they pay travel agents from 7 per cent to 5 per cent. 

 Travel agents, who were able to scupper the move last October after a tense standoff that followed a trade boycott of these airlines, are rallying to nix the move once again. 

 According to the agents, their commissions will as it is suffer because of the lower fares for the summer schedule and they can ill-afford a cut in the commission structure.

 State-owned Air-India has already announced its intention to cut the commission from April 1. 

 ?We have been verbally told that they will defer the decision till May. If they go ahead, it will be detrimental to the entire travel agent community,? said Balbir Singh Mayal, president of the Travel Agents Association of India (TAAI).

 ?Once they initiate the step, there is a possibility that the other European airlines will follow suit,? he added.

 Last year, travel agents were locked in a battle with seven European airlines when they decided to cut commissions. These included Lufthansa, British Airways, Air France, KLM, Swiss Air, Alitalia and Austrian Airlines.

 Following threats of strikes and boycott, these airlines continued giving 7 per cent commissions to the agents. There are close to 2,200 licensed travel agents operating in the country. 

 The agents used to earn a commission of 9 per cent until the 9/11 mishap rocked the fortunes of the entire airline industry. In the resulting downturn, commissions were slashed to 7 per cent. 

 ?We are being further threatened with a zero per cent commission in the near future,? said Zakhir Ahmed, president of the Travel Agents Federation Of India (TAFI).

 ?Even a 2 per cent proposed reduction in commission would mean a 30 per cent decrease in total revenue. We generate about 80 per cent of the business for the airlines and run a great risk to ourselves by selling tickets on credit,? he added.

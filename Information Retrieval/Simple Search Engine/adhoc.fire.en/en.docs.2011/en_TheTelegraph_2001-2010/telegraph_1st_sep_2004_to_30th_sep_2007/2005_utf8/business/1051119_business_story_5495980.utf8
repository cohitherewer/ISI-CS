 Disney fourth-quarter income drops 27%

 Los Angeles, Nov. 18: The Walt Disney Co reported advertising gains for the quarter at its ABC and ESPN networks, but the profits were not enough to offset sharp losses in the film division, which suffered from a string of underperformers as well as declining DVD sales.

 The company said Thursday that net income in the fourth quarter, which ended October 1, declined 27 per cent, to $379 million or 19 cents a share, from $516 million, or 25 cents, in the period a year earlier. The earnings include charges based on adjustments to stock options as well as accounting changes related to the valuation of its broadcast licenses.

 Revenue rose 3 per cent, to $7.73 billion, compared with $7.54 billion for the period a year earlier.

 Much of the decline was attributed to a $313 million loss in operating income in the filmed entertainment division, which had several box-office disappointments, including Dark Water and the Miramax offerings The Great Raid and The Brothers Grimm.

 In after-hours trading the shares fell as low as $25.32, after rising 14 cents, to $25.99, in regular trading.

 ABC and ESPN continue to be bright spots; both divisions reported increases based on higher advertising revenues. At ABC in particular, the syndication of My Wife and Kids as well as the international sales of Lost and Desperate Housewives increased profits.

 The broadcasting unit, which includes ABC, reported operating income of $48 million for the quarter in contrast to a loss of $75 million a year earlier. Operating income at the cable unit, which includes ESPN, increased to $584 million, from $523 million.

 For the year, Disney had revenue of $31.9 billion, compared with $30.75 billion in 2004. Net income was $2.5 billion in fiscal 2005, compared with $2.3 billion a year ago.

 In his comments to analysts, the chief executive, Robert A. Iger, said he planned to concentrate on several growth initiatives, like helping to restore Disneys reputation in film animation.

 Disney recently released quot;Chicken Little, quot; the studios first computer-animated movie, which so far has earned a healthy $83 million at the domestic box office despite mostly underwhelming reviews.

 A good performance of quot;Chicken Little quot; was critical for Disney because it had been supplanted as the animation leader by rivals like DreamWorks Animation and Pixar Animation Studios; Pixar will end its joint venture with Disney next year.

 Iger said negotiations were continuing with Pixar about a new distribution pact. But he would not comment on speculation that Disney would acquire Pixar to bolster its animation efforts, an issue that has been raised by some on Wall Street.

 Any acquisitions, he said, would be done to enhance content.

 Iger has focused the company on being technologically agnostic. Disney, like many other media companies, is more willing to deliver its products over cell phones, hand-held devices or computers to reach consumers.

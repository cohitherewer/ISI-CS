 Opec at ease with $50 cap

 Sydney, April 10 (Reuters): US oil at $50 a barrel might be a realistic upper limit for producer cartel Opec?s new price target as it did not appear to be endangering the global economic growth, the group?s acting secretary-general was quoted as saying on Sunday.

 Adnan Shihab-Eldin also told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation?s Inside Business programme in a pre-recorded interview that the group could agree upon its new preferred price range as soon as September.

 The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) abandoned its defunct $22-$28 a barrel price target for its basket of crude in January after oil prices had exceeded it for more than a year, but the group is anxious to keep prices below $50 to protect the economic growth ? and oil demand ? in its biggest markets.

 ?I can tell you that a more realistic (level) would be above $28 or $30,? Shihab-Eldin said, noting that producers needed a price that would finance additional investment and provide steady revenues.

 US crude at $50 equates to a price of about $43-$45 a barrel for Opec?s heavier, more sour basket of crude.

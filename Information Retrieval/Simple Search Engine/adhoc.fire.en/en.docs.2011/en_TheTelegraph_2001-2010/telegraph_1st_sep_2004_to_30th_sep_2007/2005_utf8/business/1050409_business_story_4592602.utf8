 Trade policy uncorks sops for hotels 

 GARIMA SINGH

 New Delhi, April 8: The heat is off ? and hoteliers can breathe easy.

 The government has waived a major condition under which hotels were required to obtain a certificate from a chartered accountant to substantiate their claims that they were passing on the benefits of duty-free imports of liquor and other beverages to their consumers.

 The condition had been imposed sometime in 2003 soon after a hullabaloo arose over the fact that five-star hoteliers were importing liquor without paying any duty but were ramping up prices on booze sales through their restaurants.

 The charge was that the prices were as much as three times the price at which they were importing the liquor and wines.

 Hoteliers are allowed to import liquor and other products without paying any duty to the extent of 5 per cent of their foreign exchange earnings in the previous year. In the case of one and two-star hotels and standalone restaurants, this is restricted to only credit-card payments made by their customers.

 Under the foreign trade policy unveiled today, hotels will now need to make a self-certification that they are passing on the benefits. 

 The policy required them to pass on the entire benefit to consumers ? but there was a quibble over the world ?entire? with hoteliers claiming that the mark-up at the table was because of the experience that they were providing customers.

 Hoteliers are clearly pleased that they won?t have to scrounge around for a CA certification anymore which they saw as an extreme annoyance. 

 Lalit Suri, chairman and managing director of Bharat Hotels, said, ?In banqueting, the margins are very low and full benefits are passed on to the consumers. However, in retailing, we will pass on the entire benefit but will keep our profitability margins.? The statement clearly indicates a throwback to the old times when customers were charged high prices for the liquor consumed in five-star hotels.

 ?The profitability margin decided by one hotel chain will differ from another because of a variety of reasons,? he added.

 A senior official of Indian Hotels Company said, ?Any move made by the government to make things easier for the industry is a welcome initiative. Also, it is important to note that hotels charge higher for the experience that they provide.?

 ?If customers don?t agree, they will automatically refuse to visit the hotel. The price-elasticity situation will then take its own course,? he added. 

 It may be recalled that during the NDA regime, former commerce minister Arun Jaitley had warned hoteliers that he would withdraw the facility of duty-free imports against foreign exchange earnings if they continued to rip off their customers by refusing to pass on the full benefits.

 Today?s foreign trade policy gave hotels another major concession: large hotel chains have been allowed to club the foreign exchange earnings of all the properties they run (including managed hotels) against which they can import duty-free liquor. 

 The policy says that in the area of service exports, to enable service providers upgrade the infrastructure in their associate companies, goods imported under the ?served from India? scheme will be transferable within the group companies and managed hotels. ?This provision will allow bulk sourcing and better utilisation of the entitlement,? said sources.

 Information centre for commodity prices

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 10: The National Spot Exchange for Agriculture Produce (NSEAP) and the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) have launched the first Commodity Suchna Kendra at Sirsa market in Haryana.

 The Commodity Suchana Kendra is a knowledge centre for spot and futures commodities market price and information on various products and Sirsa is the first agro-commodity market to go live with the electronic price and information dissemination system in north India.

 The Commodity Suchna Kendra will display not only the spot and futures commodity prices but also Indias first composite commodity futures Index ? MCX-COMDEX ? computed and displayed on a real-time basis.

 NSEAP plans to set up such information centres at all APMC (Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee) markets, which, over time, will link all agriculture, market players. It will also help in linking the support infrastructure from a single point access, thus benefiting farmers, traders, consumers and other end-users of commodities.

 Linking all APMCs will lead to the development of a competitive, and efficient agro-marketing chain across the country. NSEAP will enable agro-based industries procure agriculture produce at cheaper cost with complete assurance using the support infrastructure of NSEAP, said Jignesh Shah, managing director of MCX.

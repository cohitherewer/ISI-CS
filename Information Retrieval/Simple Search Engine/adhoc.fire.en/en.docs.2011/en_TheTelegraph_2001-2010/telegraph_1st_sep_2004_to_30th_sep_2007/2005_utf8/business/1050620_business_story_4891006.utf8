 GSM firms balk at spectrum-user link

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 19: The spectrum war is far from over. Cellular operators using the global system for mobile communications (GSM) and those using the code division multiple access (CDMA) technology are warming up for another bout.

 Cellular operators, in a presentation to the department of telecommunications (DoT) on spectrum allocation, have demanded that CDMA operators should also be subject to a subscriber-linked criteria while distributing spectrum from the 1800-megahertz (MHz) band.

 The operators have also urged the government that there should be no entry fee or one-time charge for third-generation (3-G) services because the unified access service licence (UASL) entitles firms to provide all types of mobile services. The licence clause states: No separate entry fee shall be charged for inter alia video conferencing... 

 The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has pointed out that an upfront lump-sum fee for IMT-2000 spectrum is contrary to the approach of the government that is based on incremental revenue share. The operators fear that such a fee would increase the cost of service and adversely impact the governments objective to reach out to rural areas and achieve the 250-million-user mark by 2007.

 The association has suggested that the DoT continue with the incremental revenue share model. The model, they believe, is fair, simple, transparent and easy to administer. It also ensures an efficient use of spectrum, claims the apex body of mobile operators.

 COAI has also objected to the proposed ceiling of 4 per cent of average gross revenue as recommended by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai). The current ceiling is 6 per cent. It is too high and needs to be brought down further, COAI said. The association has also opposed the introduction of usage charges. 

 The operators have suggested that the government should consider an overall cap on spectrum usage charges at 2 per cent of revenues. 

 Further, within this overall cap, the government may adopt a step-up approach (for both GSM and CDMA operators) for increments in fees ranging from 0.2 per cent to 0.25 per cent.

 Objecting to the proposed linkage of spectrum allocation with rollout obligation, the mobile operators association has said the existing licence cannot attract fresh rollout obligations because the companies can offer all types of mobile services under the unified access service licence. 

 Such an obligation may apply only to new operators.

 COAI director-general T. V. Ramchandran said the imposition of rollout obligations would defeat the purpose of introducing 3-G as operators would focus on meeting rollout obligations rather than market demands.

 State-of-the-art centres for automobile testing

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 14: The Planning Commission has given an in-principle approval to a proposal to establish world-class automotive testing and research centres in the country at a cost of Rs 1,700 crore.

 The project proposal, titled National Automotive Testing and R amp;D Infrastructure Project (NATRIP), plans to set up two new automotive testing and R amp;D infrastructure centres in the northern and southern hubs of the automotive industry. 

 The project will also seek upgradation of the existing infrastructure located at the Automotive Research Association of India, Pune, and Vehicle Research Development Establishment, Ahmednagar. 

 The technical committee constituted by the department of heavy industries is in the process of selecting appropriate sites for the project from a number of options, including those in Andhra Pradesh. 

 The existing testing infrastructure at the Automotive Research Association will be modernised as part of the project to meet the emerging mandatory testing requirements of the automobile industry. 

 Santosh Mohan Dev, the minister of state for heavy industries and public enterprise (independent charge), has said the proposal has been approved, said a spokesperson for the ministry. 

 The spokesperson said the institute will conduct a research for automobiles of a vast spectrum, including two-wheeler, three-wheeler and four-wheeler passenger vehicles as well as commercial vehicles. 

 The Automotive Research Association was incorporated as a corporate body in 1966 as an industrial research organisation formed by the Indian automotive industry and affiliated to the heavy industries ministry. 

 The association has expanded over the years both in terms of research and development, homologation and certification and service of competence with various modern facilities to assist the industry. 

 It was set up as a co-operative industrial research body to provide services to the industry.

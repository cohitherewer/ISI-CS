 Reliance denies settlement reports

 OUR BUREAU

 Jan. 6: Reliance Industries (RIL) tonight denied a television channel report that the warring Ambani brothers had reached a settlement last month.

 The report suggested that the family ? mother Kokilaben, Mukesh, Anil and sisters Deepti and Neena ? had agreed on December 28 to divide the promoters? stake of 34 per cent in RIL among the four siblings.

 The report capped rumours triggered by Anil?s meeting with finance minister P. Chidambaram and top mandarins in North Block earlier in the day.

 North Block officials were silent on what transpired at the meeting. Sources, however, said issues of corporate governance in Reliance group companies were discussed. The finance minister is likely to meet Sebi officials tomorrow in Mumbai. 

 Later, as reports about the deal flashed across television screens, Reliance Industries officials close to Mukesh Ambani said: ?We don?t know anything about this ... we too are watching this news.? 

 Executives close to Anil said they had been instructed not to speak on the issue, but added that another channel was carrying a denial of the news . 

 Stories of the fight deepening and being resolved have been in the air for some time now.

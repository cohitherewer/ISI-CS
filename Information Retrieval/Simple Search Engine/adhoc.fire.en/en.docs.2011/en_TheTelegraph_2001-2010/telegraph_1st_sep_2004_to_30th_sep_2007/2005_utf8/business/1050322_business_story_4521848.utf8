 New Delhi, March 21: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said the country would carry forward the reforms process for the economy to register 7-8 per cent growth next fiscal.

 ?The growth rate has almost been 7 per cent this year on the back of 8 per cent previous year. At this moment, all indications are that we may be able to deliver a 7-8 per cent growth next year,? he said in his inaugural address at the centenary celebrations of the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

 ?In 20 years, a growth rate of 8 per cent will deliver twice as much as compared with a rate of 5 per cent,? he said.

 Singh said the government is committed to putting in place a set of policies, which will provide the necessary environment for making this growth possible. ?Over the last year, policies related to investment, taxation, external trade, banking and finance, FDI, capital markets and small-scale industries have evolved towards making our industry and enterprises efficient, globally competitive and as much free from restrictions as possible.? 

 ?The direction is visible and I assure you that we will not falter in this regard,? he assured industry captains. 

 He identified infrastructure as a critical bottleneck to the country?s economic growth. ?This is a complex area and not amenable to easy solutions like the earlier reforms of the 1990s.? 

 ?I admit that the first set of reforms in the ?90s were far easier as they related largely to the external trade liberalisation and removal of industrial licensing.?

 The Prime Minister emphasised the need for a sustained attention to tackle the ?infrastructure deficit? plaguing the country. ?The government will create a policy environment for attracting private capital to develop the physical infrastructure,? he added.

 He said the country has made progresses in civil aviation, which is reflected in the current boom in airlines. ?We are continuing and speeding up the national highways development programme and NHDP-III A has been approved,? he added.

 The government has decided that all future road constructions ? barring a few exceptions ? will be through the build-operate-and-transfer route, which will provide additional investment avenues for private capital. Singh said P. Chidambaram will soon announce the details of the private container trains that was announced in the recent railway budget.

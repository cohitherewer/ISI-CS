 ONGC readies buyback offer for kin

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Raha: Open arms

 New Delhi, Nov. 25: The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation is ready to buy back its shares that are currently with Indian Oil Corporation and GAIL. A formal offer to this effect is likely to be made soon. 

 ONGC chairman Subir Raha said the buyback offer would be made according to the Sebi guidelines and the best average stock price for the last 50 days or the last six months, whichever is higher, would be offered to the two companies. 

 The government has allowed swapping of shares among oil PSUs so that they can retain their holdings instead of offloading them in the market. This option is expected to make ONGCs task easier.

 In order to rein in the spiralling fiscal deficit in 1999, the government had raised Rs 4,643 crore through the sale of shares of these companies to each other. 

 Since then, the stock prices of these companies have shot up. For instance, IOCs 9.6 per cent stake in ONGC is valued at Rs 14,000 crore. The company had shelled out only Rs 1,371 crore for these shares. GAIL also owns a 2.4 per cent stake in ONGC.

 IOC chairman S. Behuria said the decision to sell ONGC shares would be taken after carefully studying the cash-flow of the company. The shares will be offloaded only if there is an urgent need to raise funds, he added

 IOC is also expecting the governments oil bonds to come in, as it would improve the companys financial position, Behuria said. 

 However, Indian Oil is not in a position to buy back its shares from ONGC, as the companys profits nose-dived during the year due to the soaring crude costs and domestic prices not being revised to offset the loss.

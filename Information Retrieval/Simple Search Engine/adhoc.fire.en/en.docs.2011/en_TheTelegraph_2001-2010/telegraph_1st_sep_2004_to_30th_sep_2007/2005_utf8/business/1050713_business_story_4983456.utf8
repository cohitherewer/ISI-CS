 New Delhi, July 12: India and Pakistan have made headway in talks on the $4.16-billion transnational gas pipeline from Iran.

 The technical, commercial, financial and legal issues were discussed in an open and candid manner. We have reached some understanding on most issues, Pakistani petroleum secretary Ahmed Waqar said. A joint statement will be issued after the second day of discussions tomorrow, he added.

 Petroleum secretary S.C. Tripathy made a detailed presentation on the issues related to the project.

 Principles have been laid down and we are satisfied with the progress made, Waqar said. 

 He said the Islamabad meeting between Mani Shankar Aiyar and his Pakistani counterpart Amanullah Khan Jadoon was more of a broad indication of seriousness of parties concerned to take talks forward. 

 This joint working group will lay down concrete steps to make the project happen, he added.

 Asked whether the project could be implemented in the face of stiff US opposition, he said, Our President and Prime Minister have stated on numerous occasions that we will proceed with the pipeline based on our national interest.

 The US has branded Iran as a rogue nuclear state posing a danger to the world. It has, therefore, clamped economic sanctions against Iran and is opposed to a project that benefits the West Asian country. Condileeza Rice, the US secretary of state, has also said the US is opposed to the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline project.

 If the US follows its policy, both India and Pakistan could attract economic sanctions for implementing the project. However, the US has not imposed sanctions on French and Italian companies that are doing business in Iran.

 India has been keen on signing a bilateral agreement with Iran to ensure that the natural gas is delivered at the Indian border. India wants Iran to sign a separate bilateral agreement with Pakistan on the pipeline.

 Both Iran and Pakistan, on the other hand, are keen on signing a trilateral agreement. 

 India has already inked a deal with Iran to import liquefied natural gas. The deal is on track as there are no security issues involved.

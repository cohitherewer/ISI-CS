 Daewoo asset sale plan moves into the fast lane

 New Delhi, June 30: The cabinet committee on economic affairs today approved a scheme for sharing the proceeds from the asset sale of the local arm of Daewoo Motors between the creditors and the government.

 Under the scheme, the government will get 45 per cent of the money from selling the automakers assets, while 55 per cent will go to financial institutions (FIs).

 The FIs include ICICI Bank, IDBI and Exim Bank, which together have claims worth nearly Rs 1,000 crore.

 Daewoo owes the government nearly Rs 1,200 crore in customs dues, interest and penalty.

 The cabinet decision also waives dues to the government after the proceeds are shared. Officials said the scheme would facilitate early sale of the assets, which are depreciating rapidly. 

 The decision comes in the wake of the law ministrys observation that bidders will shy away from the company as the customs department could attach the assets even after a change in ownership.

 Last year, General Motors, in a bid to foray in the mini car segment in India, had conducted a due diligence to buy out the passenger car assembly assets of the Daewoo arm. The all-cash deal was valued at $100 million. 

 However, the deal never clicked as the sale was delayed by a tax dipute for over a year.

 Airline IPOs early next year

 Patel: Flight path

 Mumbai, Sept. 24: The state-owned Air-India and Indian Airlines will tap the capital market with initial public offerings early next year to fund their expansion plans. 

 Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel said at the sidelines of an edible oil conference here today that, Advisers for the initial public offerings will soon be appointed. They will help in getting the right valuation and percentage of the respective IPO and there will be stock options for the employees, too. 

 Indias civil aviation industry is one of the fastest growing in the world. Experts estimate that the domestic sector will grow at an annual rate of 20-25 per cent till 2010. 

 Before the public issues are finalised, the two airlines along with their advisers will have to sit down and restructure their entire equity holding and go for fresh valuations of their assets. For instance, compared to its operations and the assets it holds, Air-India has an equity base of Rs 153.84 crore, fully owned by the government. It needs to fund nearly Rs 36,000 crore for fleet expansion alone.

 In 2004-05, the airlines provisional estimates (revised) show earnings before interest, tax and depreciation at Rs 910 crore on a turnover of Rs 7,500 crore. In the 2005-06 Budget, the turnover was estimated at Rs 8,000 crore. The airline has a debt-equity ratio of 2.3:1.

 Air-India recently placed a multi-billion dollar order for an assortment of 50 Boeing aircraft, while Indian Airlines opted for 43 airplanes from Airbus Industrie to replace its ageing fleet.

 Patel pointed out that the country did not have even a single cargo aircraft as a result of which the cargo trade had not expanded to its full potential. 

 With Indian Airlines and Air-India slated to get new aircraft by mid-2006, the government may consider using some of their old airplanes for carrying cargo, the minister added. Patel said that Indian Airlines has plans to convert five planes from its existing fleet into cargo aircraft and Air-India too might follow suit.

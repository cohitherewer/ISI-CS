 Govt seeks Andhra fire report from ONGC

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: The petroleum ministry has asked the ONGC management to submit a detailed report on the fire, which took place at an onshore exploratory well due to a blow?out, near Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh today. 

 Sources said the ministry has taken a very serious view of the incident in which a rig was gutted. The company said all ONGC staff had been safely evacuated from the blow-out site. 

 The rig constructed by BHEL was 15 years old. It is reported to have been insured for Rs 10 crore. 

 The fire comes close on the heels of a major blaze that had gutted ONGCs Mumbai High north platform, in which over 20 lives were lost. 

 A senior official in the ministry said, While a detailed inquiry will establish the exact cause of the fire, the question is whether ONGC is following the best global practices in drilling operations. 

 An oil industry expert told The Telegraph that onshore drilling is considered relatively safe and usually a blow-out preventer is put in place when gas and oil are encountered during drilling.

 He said it could be that the blow-out preventer was not used due to overconfidence or the pressure of the gas was underestimated. As a result, a relatively weak preventer was installed which could not withstand the high pressure.

 While an internal inquiry has been ordered into the Mumbai High tragedy, the governments plans to conduct an independent inquiry is yet to begin. The second fire appears to have jolted the ministry and efforts to launch an independent inquiry are likely to be expedited. 

 During his visit to Norway last month, petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar had asked the ONGC team accompanying him to take a close look at the safety aspects of the Norwegian drilling operations. A memorandum of understanding was also signed with Norway to enable ONGC and Oil India Ltd pick up the best global practices for ensuring fool-proof safety in drilling operations.

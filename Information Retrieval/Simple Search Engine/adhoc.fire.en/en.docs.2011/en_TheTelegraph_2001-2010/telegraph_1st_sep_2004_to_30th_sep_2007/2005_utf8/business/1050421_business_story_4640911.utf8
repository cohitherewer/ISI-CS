 Cellular firms set to dial tribunal number

 Cash call 

 New Delhi, April 20: Mobile operators will move the Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) against the new roaming charge imposed by the telecom regulator.

 Talks between the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and mobile operators broke down after the regulator refused to entertain any further discussions on the issue.

 The controversy relates to an additional access deficit charge (ADC) imposed on the roaming mobile subscribers.

 ADC is paid by operators to fund those players offering telecom services as social obligations set by the government, like setting up telephones in rural areas and inaccessible areas at a higher infrastructure cost.

 Under the new Trai directive, a mobile subscriber registered in Delhi will be charged an ADC of 30 paise per minute when he goes to Calcutta and makes a call to a mobile subscriber registered in Calcutta.

 The new levy will generate about Rs 100 crore as ADC annually, which will be offered to those operators setting up mobile networks in rural areas. This will be in addition to the Rs 5,000 crore ADC that will be generated annually from the ADC imposed on long distance calls.

 Cellular operators are peeved that the regulator did not discuss with them before imposing the new ADC. The mobile operators also allege that it is against the stated objective of Trai to promote mobile phones to achieve higher teledensity.

 A senior Trai official said, ?We do not wish to comment on the discussions or their future approach. The Cellular Operators Association of India (Coai) and the Association of Unified Service Providers of India (AUSPI) held a meeting today and pointed out their concerns. The regulator has put forward its views and we feel that we are within the powers given under the Act to levy such a charge.?

 ?If they are not satisfied, they have an option to approach the TDSAT,? the official said.

 The COAI is an association of mobile operators who use the global system of mobile communication (GSM) technology, which includes Bharti and Hutch. The AUSPI represents the lobby using the code division multiple access (CDMA) technology promoted by Reliance Infocomm and Tata Indicom.

 Tata Tea brews spin-off

 New Delhi, April 15: Tata Tea is drawing up plans to transfer its tea plantations in Dooars and Assam to a new entity. 

 Managing director P. T. Siganporia told The Telegraph that the Tatas were in talks with Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi on the issue and ?we are working out a new model for the region?. 

 The company has recently hived off its tea estates in south India to a new plantation company owned largely by former Tata Tea estate workers with a small Tata holding. 

 ?That model worked in the south because workers there were keen on ownership rights ... the model in Assam has to be different (taking into account the psyche of workers there),? Siganporia said. 

 ?We are working on the issue ... the Tatas can exit the plantation business by selling the estates to a bidder. But that is not our corporate philosophy; we want to add value,? he said.

 Siganporia, however, refused to go into the details as these were still at the drawing board stage. 

 Assam government officials indicated that the plan could involve a joint management with a smaller amount of worker participation. 

 Under the southern model, over 12,000 workers of 14 tea estates in the Kannan Devan hills, comprising pluckers, sub-staff and clerical employees, will hold 75 per cent of the equity in the new company. Tata Tea holds 19 per cent stake, while the remaining 6 per cent is with a trust.

 The Assam estates have been the target of extremist groups operating in the state and the Tatas have had a bad time fending off extortionist demands. 

 Tata Teas focus at the end of the restructuring exercise, which is being dictated by increasing costs of tea production and the financial drag imposed by the Tetley buy-out, will be to manage the national and global brands it has built up or acquired.

 The cost of tea cultivation and production in India is among the highest in the world. The high costs have cut into profits from its branding and marketing arms. As a result, the company has decided to exit its plantations and focus on marketing branded tea. Tetley, now part of the Tata group, had followed a similar business strategy internationally. 

 Analysts feel exiting tea plantations coupled with a reduction in the firm?s debt-equity ratio would improve the Tata companys financial bottomline. The takeover of Tetley had meant a major drag on the Indian tea majors profit margins. 

 Tata Tea will focus on strengthening its national brands ? Tetley, set at the premium end, Temptation and mass market Agni. Besides regional brands like Kanan Devan, Gemini, Chakra and Agni Sholay will continue to be pushed in the niche markets.

 Ranchi, Nov. 9: JSW Steel Ltd and the Jharkhand government today signed an MoU to set up a 10-million-tonne steel plant and a 800-MW captive power plant in Jharkhand at an estimated investment of Rs 35,000 crore. 

 After the signing of the MoU at chief minister Arjun Mundas official residence, JSW Steel managing director Sajjan Jindal said the township that would be built by his group would emerge as a model sister city to Jamshedpur. 

 Inviting reporters to visit his groups plant and township in Karnataka, Jindal said his group was committed to social welfare. He also held out the carrot of educational institutions, research centres and commercial establishments, which, he said, would all come up in due course. 

 Jindal denied he was pressured into setting up the plant in Jharkhand. Conceding that his group had initially selected Kharagpur in West Bengal as the site, he claimed that expert opinion later suggested Kharsawan as the more suitable place because of its proximity to both Orissa and West Bengal and access to not one but two ports. 

 A beaming Munda said not a single person would be displaced by the new steel plants that would come up in the state. Industries, he asserted, would improve the living standard of people and not displace them. While some politicians are busy spreading disinformation, Munda said, his government would ensure that nobody receives a raw deal. 

 The steel plant, to be located near Hesalong in Seraikela-Kharsawan district, is expected to start production by 2010, said Jindal. Jharkhands chief secretary, P.P. Sharma, signed the MoU on behalf of the state government. 

 The MoU also records the groups commitment to set up industrial training institutes, vocational training centres and computer training for semi-literate rural women. Sajjan Jindal claimed that the plant would help generate an annual revenue of over Rs 5,000 crore for the state government besides ensuring direct and indirect employment. He also committed to ensuring transparency and highest possible employment to local people. Job aspirants, he said, would be given training by the company after selection. 

 Munda refuted charges that his government was neglecting agriculture and other areas while promoting mining. 

 An Israeli company, he claimed, had carried out a survey and found that much of the soil in the state remained unaffected by chemical fertilisers. The finding, he said, would give a boost to organic farming.

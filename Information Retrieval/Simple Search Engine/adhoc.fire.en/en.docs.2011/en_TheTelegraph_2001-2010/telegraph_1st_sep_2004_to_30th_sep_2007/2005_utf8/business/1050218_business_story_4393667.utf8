 Damodaran: At the helm

 New Delhi/Mumbai, Feb. 17: M. Damodaran will be the next chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). 

 Currently the chief of Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), Damodaran will replace G. N. Bajpai, who retires tomorrow.

 He takes over as Sebi chief at a time when the stock market is booming but there are concerns over unregulated hedge funds brought in by foreign institutional investors who had pumped in an estimated $9 billion till December 2004.

 Damodaran?s appointment was announced late in the night even as rumours swirled that the present chairman is going to get a two-month extension in view of the delicate situation before the Union budget. 

 Bajpai, in fact, met Union finance minister P. Chidambaram at his North Block office earlier in the day. It was said that Bajpai had asked for time to complete his ?unfinished agenda?.

 The unfinished agenda includes the investigation into the May 17 stock market crash.

 The others who were in the race for the top Sebi post included India?s executive director in the World Bank C. M. Vasudev and financial sector secretary N. S. Sisodia. Life Insurance Corporation chairman R. N. Bhardwaj was also believed to be in the running. Bajpai, it may be mentioned, took over as Sebi chairman after serving some time as the head of LIC.

 Earlier, the name of expenditure secretary D. Swarup was also doing the rounds. But sources said Swarup is tipped to become the chairman of the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority.

 Damodaran was instrumental in turning around the beleaguered Unit Trust of India, which was split into two entities after the 2001 fiasco. He was made the UTI chairman in 2002 after the irregularities in the mutual fund came to light.

 In his new role, Damodaran has quite a task before him. While the capital market infrastructure has improved, surveillance needs to be upgraded to meet the modern day needs. He has to ensure that Sebi rulings in different cases are upheld by the higher forums like the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) and the Supreme Court. Many of the Sebi verdicts in recent controversial cases ? Samir Arora and Alliance Mutual Fund, Shankar Sharma and First Global ? were overturned by SAT.

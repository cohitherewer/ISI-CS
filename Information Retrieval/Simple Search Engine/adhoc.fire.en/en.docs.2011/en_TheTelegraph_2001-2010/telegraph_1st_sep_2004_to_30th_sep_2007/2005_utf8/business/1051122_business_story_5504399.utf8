 Pros get a pride of place in Nokia plan

 On the move

 Calcutta, Nov. 21: Nokia plans to launch a range of high-end phones that will cater to the needs of on-the-move customers.

 ?We have mapped the work style of a professional on the move and recognised the need for secure mobile connectivity. The 9500 Communicator phone and 9300 Smartphone cater to the collaboration needs of an organisation. The E-series, which will be launched next year, will bring in more diversity,? Nokia Enterprise Solutions head-marketing Jay Vikram Bakshi said.

 Though the demand for futuristic phones is on the rise, especially among enterprise customers, the base is quite small. Entry-level phones in the sub-Rs 10,000 category still command a 50 per cent share of the cellphones sold in India.

 The Indian Cellular Association, however, pegs the current market value for high-end feature-based phones at Rs 225 crore. This is expected to grow by 70-80 per cent during the current financial year. Around one lakh high-tech devices like pocket PC and smartphones are sold in India.

 The demand is evident from the fact that even CDMA operators have introduced mobile phones with services that cater to enterprise needs. Globally, high-end phones comprise around 2 per cent of the total 750 million handsets sold.

 ?It is becoming increasingly necessary to introduce collaborative features in high-end phones that will allow executives to remain in touch with their offices while on the move. In this case, security of data assumes great importance,? said Bakshi.

 Nokia is adopting a three-pronged approach in selling these handsets. The first step is to utilise its huge retail network in the country. While these are important sale outlets, the company is also approaching the enterprise with the handset as a security solution. The third and evolving route is through the decision maker for an entire chain of users.

 Regarding trends in usage of high-end phones, Bakshi said while adoption of mobile enterprise among companies is gaining momentum, there are also requirements that are vertical specific. ?Most enterprise phones keep in mind the collaborative communication needs of the corporate user and incorporate features accordingly,? he said. ?Thus camera or video recording options take a backseat while data storage and high-speed secured data access features are high on the priority list.?

 The network operator also gains importance as these high-end phones provide service providers with an opportunity to introduce value-added and data communication services for the corporate user.

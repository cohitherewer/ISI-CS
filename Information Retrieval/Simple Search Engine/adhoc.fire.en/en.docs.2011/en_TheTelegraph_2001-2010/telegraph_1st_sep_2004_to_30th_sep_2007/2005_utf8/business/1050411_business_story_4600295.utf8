 Surge in assets managed by mutuals

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Calcutta, April 10: The assets under management (AUM) of the mutual fund industry registered a growth of 8 per cent during the last fiscal.

 The total AUM was Rs 1,49,816 crore on March 31, 2005 against Rs 1,38,645 crore on March 31, 2004.

 Last year saw a consolidation of three fund houses, including IL amp;FS, PNB and SUN F amp;C Mutual Fund, while ABN Amro Mutual Fund made its entry in the market.

 Benchmark Mutual Fund recorded the largest growth at 85 per cent, while the largest fall of 213 per cent was seen in BOB Mutual Fund.

 UTI Mutual Fund maintained its position at the top slot. 

 While Franklin Templeton lost its position as the largest private mutual fund in December to Prudential ICICI Mutual Fund, it regained its position in the end.

 Other funds, which saw substantial downfall in assets, are Alliance, LIC, Sahara, ING Vysya and Escorts Mutual Fund. Among other large gainers were mutual funds from Tata, HSBC, Taurus, Reliance, SBI, JM and Kotak.

 ABN Amro Mutual Fund grossed a collection of Rs 1,500 crore during its IPO of four schemes. However, in the next month, the fund saw a windfall in its asset size to Rs 1,152 crore and ended the year with Rs 1,100 crore in its kitty. The assets of IL amp;FS were taken over by UTI Mutual Fund, while the other two were merged with Principal Mutual Fund. 

 Also, the year saw a deluge of IPOs hitting the scene with most of the fund houses launching equity funds, especially in the mid-cap segment, taking the rally of these stocks on the bourses.

 According to industry sources, the total accruals from such IPOs is around Rs 6,000 crore, which is almost 24 per cent more than the total funds added by the industry during the last calendar year.

 One of the most obvious examples is two of Franklin Templeton funds. 

 While Franklin Blue Chip Fund grew to be a Rs 2,000 crore fund after delivering a consistent performance for about a decade, Franklin Flexicap Fund collected Rs 1,500 crore during its initial offer period.

 The current year will see the world?s largest asset management company ? Fidelity Investments, entering the Indian market. 

 However, it remains to be seen how much it contributes to the size of the domestic mutual fund industry.

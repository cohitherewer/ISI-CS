 New Delhi, Feb. 16: Hyundai Motors India Ltd plans to set up a second manufacturing plant in India in the next three years. The new plant will come up on a plot adjacent to the existing factory in Chennai.

 The South Korean auto major has said construction work on the new plant will start in April this year and will be completed by the middle of 2007.

 ?With the new plant in place, the annual production capacity of Hyundai will go up to 4 lakh units from the present production level of 2.5 lakh units,? a company spokesperson said. The company did not say how much it will invest in the new plant.

 The carmaker expects a more than 40 per cent increase in turnover by the end of the fiscal. 

 The company, which had a turnover of over Rs 5,000 crore last fiscal has projected a turnover of Rs 7,000 crore by the end of this fiscal, the official spokesperson said. 

 Hyundai Motor chairman, Chung Mong-Koo, who visited the Chennai plant, said today that the company had decided to add a second plant to Hyundai Motor India to take advantage of the high growth potential of India, the spokesperson said. 

 In his statement Mong-Koo said, ?We need to expand production here to gain the upper hand in competition with our rivals in this market, which grows 12 per cent every year.? 

 The company spokesperson said that Hyundai Motor India will also serve as a hub for exports to Europe, Latin America and West Asia.

 The company said it could not comment whether the new facility will be used to make the existing models or new ones. 

 The Santro, which is in the B segment, is the flagship brand of the company. Domestic sales of the car was 1,04,748 units for 2004, a growth of 12 per cent over the previous year. It had also exported 69,961 units. 

 Getz, Accent, Sonata and Elantra are the other brands that the Korean carmaker produces in India. 

 Hyundai India also sells the completely built-up units (CBU) of the Terracan, a sports utility vehicle (SUV).

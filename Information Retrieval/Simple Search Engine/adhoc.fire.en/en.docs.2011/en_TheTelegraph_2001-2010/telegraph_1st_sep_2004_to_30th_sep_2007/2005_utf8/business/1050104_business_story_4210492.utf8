 Mutuals focus on corporate bonds

 New Delhi, Jan. 3: Mutual funds? exposure to corporate bonds is likely to rise to 80 per cent by the end of calendar year 2005, says a study conducted by Assocham.

 The total investment made by the mutual fund industry in corporate bonds, however, stood at 65 per cent in August 2004. Mutual funds had invested 44 per cent of their debt portfolios in corporate bonds issued in the calendar year 2003.

 Mutual funds? affinity to government securities will slip to about 12 per cent by the calendar year 2005 from 17 per cent in August 2004.

 According to data available, in calendar year 2003, mutual funds? affinity to government securities was restricted to 41 per cent.

 Assocham president Mahendra K. Sanghi said since government securities have a much higher duration for maturity than corporate bonds, the funds will keep on increasing their exposure and affinity for corporate bonds in 2005 and later. This is because a higher maturity period results in valuation losses.

 He, however, pointed out that corporate bonds with lower duration of maturity, which normally does not exceed five years, will relatively cause lower valuation losses in future and, thus, remain an attraction for investment by mutual funds.

 ?This will be a primary reason for further spurt of mutual funds? investments in corporate bonds,? said Sanghi.

 The study says corporate bonds will continue to be a prominent investment avenue for mutual funds since they provide diversification benefits and higher risk-adjusted returns.

 Moreover, in the long-term, as the debt markets mature and acquire greater depth, liquidity in corporate bonds will also improve.

 This will not only enhance the access of ?A? and ?BBB? rated companies to debt markets, but also increase the role of mutual funds as a disintermediation channel for meeting the resource requirements of the corporate sector.

 The surge in corporate bond investment by debt-oriented mutual funds will continue because of attractive spreads of corporate bonds over G-secs and their reduced risk perception.

 The study mentioned that the downward trend in interest rates in the country had resulted in debt-oriented mutual funds? concentration on G-Secs to reap the concomitant valuation benefits a few years ago.

 In recent times, given the upward pressure on interest rates, the proportion of investments have changed, with debt funds increasing their exposure to corporate bonds.

 The study also forecasts that in the global mutual fund industry, the assets under management held by the Indian mutual fund industry will also rise significantly to 20 per cent from its present level of about 6 per cent.

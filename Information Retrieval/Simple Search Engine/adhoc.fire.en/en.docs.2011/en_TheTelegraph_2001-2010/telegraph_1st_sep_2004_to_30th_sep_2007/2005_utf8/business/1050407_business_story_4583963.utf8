 Allahabad Bank issue oversold

 Mumbai, April 6: The public offering of Allahabad Bank was oversubscribed by more than three times on its opening day today. 

 Against an issue size of 10 crore shares, the cumulative bid quantity in both the exchanges was over 33 crore shares, according to data received late in the evening. Sources said most of the bids had come in at the upper end of the band. Allahabad Bank is offering these shares at a price band of Rs 75-82 apiece.

 While institutional investors were more active today, it is expected that interest from retail investors should pick up towards the close of the issue. The public issue will close on April 12. Capital market observers said the investor interest witnessed today is reflective of the buoyancy attached with banks. 

 The banking sector is expected to be a major gainer as demand for loans from the corporate sector rises in a bullish economic environment. Analysts said the sector has now come out of the lower treasury income phase and its performance has been increasingly driven by its core activities of lending.

 While the public offering of Punjab National Bank (PNB) had recently witnessed major investor interest, it is felt that the response to the Allahabad Bank issue is a positive signal for Bank of India and Bank of Baroda, which are keen on floating similar issues in the near future.

 At the lower end of the price band, the issue of Allahabad Bank will mobilise Rs 750 crore, while it will garner Rs 820 crore at the higher end of the price band.

 Of the total offer, the bank has reserved 1 crore shares for its employees and another 1 crore for its existing retail shareholders.

 Of the balance net offer of 8 crore shares, 4 crore are reserved for allotment to qualified institutional buyers on a discretionary basis and 1.2 crore shares are reserved for allotment to non-institutional buyers. The balance 2.8 crore would be allotted to retail investors on a proportionate basis. 

 The issue is being made to augment the capital base of the bank and meet its future capital requirements arising out of the implementation of the Basel II standards. 

 The capital will also be utilised for general corporate purposes including development of infrastructure to support business growth and service customers.

 Staff strike 

 Employees of Allahabad Bank across the country today went on a strike protesting the dilution of the government stake in the bank after the second public offer.

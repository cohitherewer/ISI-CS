 Hyundai Dec. sales rise 21%

 Seoul, Jan. 3 (Bloomberg): Hyundai Motor, South Koreas largest automaker, said it sold 21 per cent more vehicles last month because of a surge in exports to US and Europe and a recovery in sales at home.

 Hyundai Motor sold 230,437 vehicles in December, the carmaker, based in Ulsan city, south of Seoul, said in a filing to the Korea Stock Exchange today. Exports, including sales by factories in India, China and Turkey, rose 26.5 per cent to 179,364 vehicles, while domestic sales rose 4.6 to 51,073 units.

 Hyundai Motor and affiliate Kia motors are expanding production overseas as part of plans to become one of the top five automakers in the world by the end of the decade.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Step in for a slice of the sky

 Ujjwala The Condoville

 New Town, Rajarhat

 This is where the real action 

 is in the government?s showpiece township, and Ujjwala The 

 Condoville, coming up in Action Area II of New Town, is 

 in the heart of the happening corridor.

 Closer to VIP Road and the airport, 

 Ujjwala, a more contemporary cousin of the now inaugurated 

 Utsa in Action Area I, comes from the same stable of Bengal 

 Ambuja, which gave the city its first large-format housing 

 complex in Udayan The Condoville.

 The two 12-storeyed HIG towers 

 house the 235 luxury apartments, ranging from 1,100 to 2,800 

 sq ft. Buyers can choose from two, three and four-bedroom 

 options, some duplex garden houses and a handful of exclusive 

 penthouses with their own plunge pools and jacuzzis.

 Designed by Kapil Bhalla, an ample 

 skycourt, a large opening in the middle of the building, 

 promises to be ?a first? in the city. 

 Besides being an interesting architectural 

 feature and adding to the view perspective, it will serve 

 to enhance cross-ventilation by tunnelling in the air, thus 

 maximising light gain and airflow.

 The design lays emphasis on the 

 creation of large, central open spaces. Extensive landscaping 

 by Jayashree Bhalla will see over a hundred species of flowers 

 nestling around the shaded walkways and special areas like 

 Jhil Mil, the kids? zone, Jaltaranga, the entrance plaza, 

 or Sonar Bagan, the Dada-Dadis? retreat, laid out.

 ?More than just features, we have 

 focused on the quality and ambience of the product. The 

 core issues concerning the consumer, like construction systems 

 and ingredients, ventilation and illumination and traffic 

 flow pattern management, have all been adequately addressed,? 

 says Bengal Ambuja MD Harsh Neotia.

 STATUS: Launch on May 6. To 

 be completed in two years

 PRICE: Rs 16-35 lakh (approximately, 

 except for the penthouses, which would cost between Rs 60 

 and 70 lakh)

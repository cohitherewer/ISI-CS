 Picture perfect: AirTel offers video

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 22: If all you could do was to go green with envy when your friend is showing off his video phone, AirTel has a solution: get that video on your existing phone at just Rs 30.

 But your existing phone would still need to be a general packet radio service (GPRS) enabled phone. Such phones across manufacturers like Nokia and Motorola are priced at Rs 6,000 and upwards.

 AirTel today launched video service for non-video phones. The operators of both pre-paid and post-paid GPRS customers across the country can avail of this service. 

 To access this service, an AirTel GPRS customer using a non-video phone just needs to go to the AirTel Live portal and simply click on the ?Videos for Non-Video Phones? section.

 The customer has to select a video of his choice. The video along with the software gets downloaded on the phone, and the customer can then view the video. Each video download will be charged at Rs 30 and can be viewed as many times as desired by the customer. The duration of the video may be typically 10-30 seconds, depending on the phone?s memory availability.

 This unique service has been made possible by a software called Oplayo Vidlet. The software is an all-in-one video player for Java-enabled mobile phones, developed by Oplayo Oy, a Finnish company pioneering in mobile software technology. 

 The software contains both the playback and the media content in one small package. It works as any standard downloadable Java application, bringing video to mass-market mobile phones.

 Announcing the introduction of the service, Atul Bindal, chief marketing officer and director, Bharti Cellular Ltd, said, ?The launch of video for non-video phones, first time in the country through the AirTel Live mobile portal, represents our latest initiative to provide what the best in mobile technology has to offer. For users of non-videophones, the service opens a whole new world, which further enhances their mobile telephony experience.?

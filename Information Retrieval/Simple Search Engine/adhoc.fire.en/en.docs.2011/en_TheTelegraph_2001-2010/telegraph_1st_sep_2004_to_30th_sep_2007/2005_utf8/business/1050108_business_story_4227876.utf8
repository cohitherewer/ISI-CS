 BSNL to take a hit of Rs 1254 cr 

 New Delhi, Jan. 7 (PTI): State-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd today said the new ADC regime announced by the telecom regulator would result in a Rs 1254 crore loss annually and might upset its operations in the rural areas.

 ?BSNL has to provide rural telephones at tariffs of Rs 50 a month only against the average cost-based rental of Rs 361. In addition it provides more free calls and lower call charges for rural customers so as to keep these services affordable,? BSNL said in strongly worded statement.

 The new regime of access deficit charge (ADC), a levy paid by private operators to BSNL for rural operations, is likely to cause revenue loss of about Rs 1254 crore per annum, BSNL said.

 BSNL claimed that it has incurred a whopping expenditure of Rs 40,000 crore from 2001 to 2004 in rural telephony and socially desirable projects and had ambitious plans for the current year and future to achieve the targets set by the government; this may get derailed with the new regime.

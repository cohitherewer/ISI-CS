 Index to track Indian scrips on US bourses

 GAURAV CHOUDHURY

 Investors? dream

 New Delhi, Oct. 11: Investors and analysts keen to track the shares of Indian companies listed on American bourses no longer need to pore over reams of data. They can now do so by monitoring the movement of a single dedicated index.

 Buoyed by the brisk trading in the shares of Indian firms on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq and American Stock Exchange, Texas-based consultancy firm Halter Financial Group has launched a specific index for Indian companies listed and traded on these bourses.

 The index ? Halter USX India Index ? is the only one in the world devoted exclusively to India-focused public companies transacted on US bourses.

 The index has been developed by the Halter group and the American Stock Exchange ? the second largest financial auction market in the US after NYSE.

 ?The Halter USX India Index was created in response to unique opportunities available in India as well as the current dynamics in the US capital markets,? the company said.

 The index comprises companies whose common stock is traded in the US and the majority of whose business is conducted in India.

 A company must be listed on the NYSE, Nasdaq or American Stock Exchange and have an average market capitalisation of at least $50 million for the preceding 40 trading days for it to be included in the index.

 In addition, the selection committee, which has the final say on the inclusion or otherwise of any company from the index, may consider other factors, including the size of the public float, liquidity and fundamentals of all existing and potential constituents.

 At present, 17 Indian companies listed and traded on American bourses are included in the index. These are Cognizant Technology Solutions, Covansys Corp, Dr Reddy?s Lab, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Igate Corp, Infosys, Kanbay International, Lionbridge Technologies Inc, MTNL, Rediff.com, Satyam Computer Services, Satyam Infoway, Syntel Inc, Tata Motors, VSNL and Wipro.

 The index, rolled out last week, also gives a 52-week historical trend movement. On a historical scale, the Halter USX India Index was up by 30.7 per cent ? significantly higher than the benchmark Nasdaq and Dow Jones Industrial Average, which increased by 13.4 per cent and 4.8 per cent respectively. Analysts say the differential reflects growing demand of scrips of Indian companies by the American investors.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 VAT net to be cast far amp; wide

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL AND SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, March 31: The value-added tax (VAT) regime will make income tax evasion more difficult, even as it will simplify the sales tax structure.

 ?The VAT structure has been formulated keeping in mind the far-reaching positive impact it will have on the entire tax system of the country,? a senior government official said.

 However, traders feel that the new regime will spawn more grey-market transactions instead of bringing in greater surveillance. 

 ?In order to survive, traders will find out ways and means to do their business in a profitable manner,? Mahesh Singhania of the Federation of West Bengal Trade Association said.

 Several steps are being taken by the government to realise the full potential of the new structure. 

 For instance, a committee has already been formed with officials from the departments of customs, income tax, commercial tax and central excise for better co-ordination.

 Also, a master software is being developed where all the details of the dealers will be incorporated for better surveillance.

 Here?s how it may work to the advantage of the income tax department: Under the current system, a trader has to submit an invoice for the sales tax paid with the person?s income tax returns to claim set off against income tax payable.

 But, the sales tax invoice was based on the declared sales of the trader and there was no way to compare it with the actual purchases made by the person. Thus, the trader could use this loophole to show a deflated sales figure. 

 As a consequence, the resultant income figure and tax on it was only a fraction of the actual.

 Also, due to inadequate interface between the departments of commercial tax and income tax, there was not much scope for the assessing officer to check the validity of the invoice.

 Under the VAT regime, the trader will claim set off for the net tax payable, calculated by deducting input tax on purchases from output tax on sales, from his income tax. 

 However, in the current scenario, if the assessing officer senses any abnormality in the income figure, apart from the VAT invoice, the officer may also ask for the commercial tax statement of the assessee.

 The commercial tax statement can be used to calculate the total purchases made, which in turn can reveal the real turnover of the business and income of the trader.

 ?Although nothing has been decided yet, it is a possibility that the income tax department may, at a later date, make the submission of commercial tax statement compulsory with income tax returns,? the official said.

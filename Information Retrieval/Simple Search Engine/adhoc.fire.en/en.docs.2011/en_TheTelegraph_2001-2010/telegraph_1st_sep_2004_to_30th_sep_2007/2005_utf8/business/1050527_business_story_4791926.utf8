 Crisil upgrades Ambuja bonds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 26: Crisil has upgraded the ratings of the non-convertible debenture issue of Gujarat Ambuja Cements Ltd (GACL) to AAA/stable from AA+/stable because of its strengthening capital structure and enhanced financial flexibility.

 The rating agency has also reaffirmed the rating of the short-term programme at P1+. Crisil said GACLs ratings benefit from its superior operating efficiencies, resulting from its high rate of operations, use of captive power, lower freight costs as it uses split location plants and large sales tax exemption. 

 It also said the rating factors GACLs exposure to the volatile Gujarat market, which accounts for 12 per cent of the companys revenues. The state is characterised by increased competition and price volatility. Crisil expects GACL to maintain a strong business profile in the medium to long term.

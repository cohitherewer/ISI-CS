 More expats on TCS roster

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 21: Information technology majors like Tata Consultancy Services are increasingly evolving their global workforce around expatriates and employees from foreign countries as they compete against international rivals for bigger contracts in the developed countries.

 Human capital is the biggest driver in the company. Earlier our project size was not more than $10 million. We now bid for projects worth $50-100 million and our human capital requirements are changing as a result, said S. Padmanabhan, global human resource development head at TCS.

 Getting software specialists with global experience is a very important driver for generating business.

 TCS, which has a market capitalisation of Rs 63,000 crore, generates an annual income of over $2 billion and the company is growing at an annual rate of around 25 per cent.

 The needs of big companies are different. They have to sell and compete globally. It is necessary to have a global workforce as our foreign customers need multi-language capabilities, said Padmanabhan while making a presentation before the companys expatriate employees who come from countries like Hungary, Germany, Brazil and others.

 The industry is so unique that it has to cater to different time zones, he added. 

 TCS has 1,400 non-Indian nationals on its rolls accounting for 3.5 per cent of the companys total roster strength of 45,714 employees. In March 2004, TCS had 31,121 employees. During the next 12 months, the company has hired 15,000 more.

 According to Padmanabhan, the number of women in the company is around 21% of the total workforce, which is a better than average gender composition in the industry. 

 TCS now has 149 offices in 33 countries and 33 delivery centres in 10 countries.

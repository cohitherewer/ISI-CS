 New Delhi, Jan. 14: In an attempt to boost bilateral trade, the European Union today agreed to review anti-dumping measures against products from India and decided that Indian goods not meeting phytosanitary standards will not be destroyed.

 ?They (EU) have agreed to review anti-dumping measures against products from India,? said Kamal Nath, Union minister of commerce and industry, after a two-hour long meeting with the new EU trade commissioner, Peter Mandelson.

 ?They have also agreed not to destroy consignments which do not meet phytosanitary standards,? he added.

 During the meeting, India raised issues, including market access, problems faced by marine exports to European Union countries and the new general system of preferences.

 ?It was also reiterated that issues like agriculture, non-agriculture market access and services get equal importance in negotiations,? said Nath.

 ?We want to see steps that take the Doha development agenda forward and discussed how to move forward with the new European Commission,? he added.

 The two countries have agreed to conclude a bilateral investment agreement and institute early warning system to identify and remove trade irritants. 

 Mandelson, however, expressed disappointment that despite the growing interest in investment in India by EU companies, actual investment levels remained low. He said India needs a predictable regulatory environment.

 He added that the new European Commission will push for economic reforms to strengthen competition in Europe?s single market and ?improve the way we regulate our economy?.

 Nath said the development dimension should remain at the heart of WTO negotiations. He added that EU should take a leadership role in resolving the implementation-related concerns of the developing countries and in operationalising the special and differential treatment clauses.

 The EU should also ensure that the principle of ?less than full reciprocity? is applied without fail while according concessions to the developing countries, he said. 

 He expressed the hope that the Doha work programme will now get the necessary impetus and reach early fruition, leading to substantial market access for developing countries in agriculture, non-agricultural products as well as the key areas of services.

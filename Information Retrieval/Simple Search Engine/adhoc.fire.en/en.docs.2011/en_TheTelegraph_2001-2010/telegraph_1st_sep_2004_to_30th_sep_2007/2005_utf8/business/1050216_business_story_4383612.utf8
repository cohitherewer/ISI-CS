 Longer waiting time for motor insurers

 Rao: Taking time

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDA) today said it will not be able to meet its April deadline for de-tariffing the motor insurance portfolio.

 De-tariffing will give insurance companies the freedom to fix their premium rates on their motor insurance portfolio.

 ?We are likely to miss the April deadline,? IRDA chairman C. S. Rao said here today on the sidelines of a conference for actuaries.

 It now appears that the administered tariff regime for motor insurance is likely to continue into the next fiscal. This is a huge setback for insurance companies, which have been pressuring the regulator to allow market forces to determine pricing patterns in the industry.

 Rao said the detariffing of motor insurance has to be done for both owners? damage and the third-party liability. ?It cannot be done in isolation,? he added.

 After the entry of private general insurance companies, the industry had been demanding de-tariffing of the motor insurance since they felt that their products were underpriced.

 Insurers feel that with de-tariffing, there could be a reduction in the insurance cost. It will also help both the companies and the consumers as it will inject healthy competition and offer greater choices.

 Industry sources said the insurers would be in a better position to price the ?own damage? portion of motor insurance by taking into account 30 rating factors, including make and model, engine power, age of vehicle, licensed carrying capacity, safety features and repair and replacement costs.

 The road transport industry, however, fears that de-tariffing could lead to an increase in motor insurance premium and thus an increase in their working costs.

 In such a situation, they fear that the increased costs might have to be passed on to the consumers, which could make road transport costlier than rail freight movement.

 Rao said the regulator was also considering the possibility of de-tariffing the marine and hull insurance portfolio.

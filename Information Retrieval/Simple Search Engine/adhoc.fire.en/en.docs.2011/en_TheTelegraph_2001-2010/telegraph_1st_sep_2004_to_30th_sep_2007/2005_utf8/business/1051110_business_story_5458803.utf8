 Astra takes Teva to court

 Patent pill

 London, Nov. 9 (Reuters): AstraZeneca Plc is suing Teva Pharmaceuticals over the Israeli firms plans to launch a copycat version of one of its best selling and fastest growing drugs, Seroquel for schizophrenia.

 Europes third-biggest drugmaker, also facing a generic challenge to its top-selling ulcer pill Nexium, said on Wednesday it had filed the lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.

 The suit was widely expected after AstraZeneca said in September that Teva had applied to US regulators to market a generic version of Seroquel, which generated $2 billion of sales in 2004, up 33 per cent from 2003.

 The suit automatically stops the US Food and Drug Administration from approving a generic version of Seroquel until spring 2008, unless a court case is heard and lost before that date. Analysts said such cases tend to take two or three years to reach a final court decision.

 We believe the market expected AstraZeneca to file a suit for patent infringement, Nomura analyst Michael Leacock wrote in a research note. It is still reassuring that AstraZeneca is vigorously defending its patent estate.

 AstraZeneca will continue vigorously to defend and enforce its intellectual property rights protecting Seroquel, the company said in a statement.

 David Brennan, AstraZenecas new chief executive, said last week he was looking to buy medicines in late-stage clinical trials following a series of setbacks to the groups own drugs pipeline and amid generic challenges to key medicines.

 Earlier, Ranbaxy Laboratories had applied to the US regulators to launch a generic version of AstraZenecas $4-billion-a-year ulcer pill Nexium.

 Analysts at CSFB cut their investment rating on AstraZeneca to underperform from neutral and reduced their share price target to ?25 pounds from ?26.50 and lifted their target price on GlaxoSmithKline Plc shares to ?15.75 from ?14.60, and kept an outperform investment rating. They view GSK as having one of the strongest pipelines of drugs in the industry.

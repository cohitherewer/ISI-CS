 Nath vows to shield farmers at any cost 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 7: India will stand firm on protecting its farm sector even if the WTO talks in Hong Kong go the Cancun way next week. 

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath today assured Parliament of the governments resolution to protect its farmers interest by saying, We will not compromise the interests of our 650 million farmers whatever we may get in goods or services. 

 If Hong Kong has to end without an agreement so be it, he added.

 The minister said, If we cant make them (the developed countries) agree, believe me, we will also not agree. India will carry on even after Hong Kong and the interest of the countrys farmers will be protected. 

 He pointed out that the agriculture remained the most structurally flawed part of the global trade and WTO.

 Nath said if there was no convergence ahead of the World Trade Organisations ministerial beginning December 13, it was because of India and other developing countries not willing to accept the current imbalances in the agriculture section. 

 Until specific commitments are made by the developed countries what they are going to do when the export subsidies will be phased out in its entirety and the domestic support eliminated, there will be no agreement, the minister said.

 At the same time, India will not be totally rigid in trade talks and the whole strategy of give and take would be driven by employment generation and economic enhancement in developing countries, he clarified.

 Nath pointed out that the developed countries gave $1 billion to their farmers everyday and thereby created artificial prices. As a result, poor Indian farmers have to compete both with the Western farmers and their governments. He said India stood for market access but not artificial prices that were subsidised. It is not a question of free trade but fair trade. It is not the completion but the content of the round which matters, the commerce minister said.

 Citing statistics, he said the multilateral trade negotiations had benefited India as the countrys merchandise exports grew from $30 billion in 1995 to $75 billion in 2004 and services from $6.7 billion to $40 billion.

 But, in contrast, agricultural exports grew from $6.3 billion in 1995 to only $7.3 billion in 2004 indicating barriers and lack of market access in the developed countries.

 The minister said the US cotton prices, for example, has a subsidy component of 47 per cent due to which developing countries were not able to export cotton in that country.

 Tatas win race for SA telecom firm stake

 OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES

Mumbai, Feb. 13: The Tatas have won a bid to 

acquire a 26 per cent stake in South Africa?s Second Network Operator (SNO) in 

a deal that gives them an entry into the long-distance and fixed-line businesses 

of that country.

 South Africa?s department of telecommunications has approved an application by Tata Africa Holdings to acquire the stake in the basic-phone operator, industry sources said.

 ?The minister of communications, Ivy Matsepe-Casaburri, has taken a decision to award a 26 per cent holding to Tata Africa with immediate effect,? a release from South Africa?s department of telecommunications said. 

 The minister has requested shareholders to finalise agreements and plans to facilitate the issue of licences quickly. However, Tata group sources declined comment on whether they had, indeed, won the race for SNO. 

 Eskom Telecommunications, a division of power utility Eskom, and transport company Transtel own 30 per cent of SNO; Nexus Connexion controls 19 per cent, Communitel 12.5 per cent and two consortia 12.5 per cent each.

 Winning the bid means Videsh Sanchar Nigam (VSNL) ? a Tata group company ? will operate SNO, which is being developed as a rival to the state-owned Telkom. VSNL will control a new company Sepco ? along with Communitel and two consortia ? that would own SNO.

 The international telephone major had acquired Tyco last year in a move that gave it access to the US major?s network. Today?s deal for SNO signals that the Tatas are expanding their telecom network at home and overseas.

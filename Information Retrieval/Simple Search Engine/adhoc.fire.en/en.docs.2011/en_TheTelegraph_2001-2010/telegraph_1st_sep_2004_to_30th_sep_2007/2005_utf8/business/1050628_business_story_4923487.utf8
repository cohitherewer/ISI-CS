 Manmohan sees slower growth

 New Delhi, June 27: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today scaled down the economic growth rate during the plan period to 7-8 per cent from 8 per cent projected earlier. 

 Addressing the inaugural day of the crucial two-day meeting of the National Development Council (NDC) convened to approve the mid-term appraisal of the Tenth Five-year Plan, the Prime Minister said: We cannot achieve the original plan target of 8 per cent growth. The mid-term appraisal shows that performance thus far is well below this target, averaging 6.5 per cent in the past three years. The UPA government has set a revised target of 7-8 per cent for the remaining two years of the Tenth Plan (2002-07). 

 Singh pointed at the poor performance of agriculture, which had been growing by a mere 1.5 per cent over the past three years, as the root cause holding back the economic growth. Unfortunately, the performance of agriculture appears to have deteriorated and possibly would not exceed 1.5 per cent growth during the Tenth Plan, he added.

 Singh said the cornerstone of the plan strategy was a reversal of the declining trend to achieve 4 per cent growth in the agricultural sector. But he lamented that this had not been achieved over the last three years.

 Because of the disturbing performance of agriculture, Singh said, It is hardly surprising that a perception has grown that the benefits of growth have bypassed a substantial section of our people.

 The Prime Minister exhorted the chief ministers to explore the possibilities of doubling farm output in the 10 years for which he suggested the constitution of an NDC sub-committee to undertake concrete action. On the problem-ridden infrastructure front, the Prime Minister referred to the vital need to overcome power shortages that is plaguing practically all states and creation of environment for attracting both public and private investment in the sector.

 For this, he said, We should restore the health of electricity agencies in the states by reducing average transmission and commercial losses by 10 per cent in the next two years and focusing on providing quality power at appropriate prices.

 Singh also emphasised on improving the quality of district administration for development of rural areas. It is necessary that civil servants are given minimum security of tenure as changes without notice and short tenures do not produce accountable results, he noted.

 Outlining the positive aspects of the economy, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said: Inflation, which was a concern in mid-2004, is now under control, industrial growth had picked up recording 8.1 per cent growth, savings rate is high and fiscal deficit has been under checked.

 The mid-term appraisal has also underlined some important weaknesses in the economy that required urgent corrective action.

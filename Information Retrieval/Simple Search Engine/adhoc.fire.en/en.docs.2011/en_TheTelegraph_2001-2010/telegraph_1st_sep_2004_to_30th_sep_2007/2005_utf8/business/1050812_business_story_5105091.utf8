 Calcutta, Aug. 11: ICICI Bank will sell its 20.44 per cent stake in Federal Bank and 12 per cent in South Indian Bank (SIB). 

 We have been the white knight for the two banks. Since their balance sheets are strong now, it is the right time to quit. The sale process will be over in two years, CEO and managing director K.V. Kamath said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce.

 ICICI Banks ties with Federal Bank date back to 1992, when its parent, ICICI, in its avatar as a development finance institution, acquired a 12.44 per cent stake through a private equity placement. It later bought another 8 per cent, taking its holding above 20 per cent. 

 Relations between them had been smooth until differences over splitting the post of Federal Bank chairman and managing director came to the fore. ICICI Bank wanted the top slot carved up into two functions.

 In any case, the countrys second-largest bank would have to dilute its stakes in the two south-based banks under a Reserve Bank guideline that caps the holding of a corporate body in a bank at 5 per cent. We have decided to sell our entire holding rather than stay on the board of the two banks with a 5 per cent stake, Kamath said. In South Indian Bank, ICICI Bank is the largest shareholder; IFCI, UTI Bank and others together hold 7 per cent. Individual shareholders control the rest of the equity.

 Rural credit 

 ICICI Bank is betting heavily on rural credit, especially farm loans, to drive its growth in a strategy where the role of micro-credit organisations will be crucial. Kamath said the bank will provide people with technology to set up micro-credit organisations across the country. By 2008-09, 200 such organisations should be in business, serving as channels for credit disbursals. Each of these will oversee three districts. Tie-ups with 40 micro-credit institutions are likely this year.

 The rural credit target this year is Rs 11,000 crore, 20 per cent of all ICICI Bank loans. The focus will be on green vegetables. We are also open to the idea of tying up with companies with expertise in this field, Kamath added. 

 Knowledge centre 

 ICICI Bank has asked the Bengal government for 10 acres to set up a knowledge-processing centre in the city. The Calcutta hub, catering to the east and northeast, will tap Bengals knowledge-based human resources. The centre, which will be ready within three years of the land allotment, will offer insurance and asset management products. Some work from the Mumbai and Hyderabad centres could be shifted to the unit.

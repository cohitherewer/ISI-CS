 New Delhi, April 5: Germany today assured India that it would take a re-look at the anti-dumping duty it has clamped on Indian textile exports.

 The issue came up for discussion at a meeting between finance minister P. Chidambaram and German economics minister Wolfgang Clement here today.

 Addressing a joint press conference with his German counterpart, Chidambaram said he had highlighted the fact that India was importing textile machinery from Germany, which in turn was being used to produce textiles for exports. 

 The imposition of anti-dumping duty on Indian textile exports, was therefore, counter-productive, he added.

 Clement said as a matter of policy, Germany is in favour of free trade and open markets as the country itself was a big exporter. ?Some specific cases of anti-dumping have been brought to our notice and we will look at the problem,? he said.

 Clement said German companies had a high-level of technical expertise and were keen to invest in major projects in the Indian infrastructure sector. These investments could cover the entire gamut of infrastructure, including power, telecom, roads, seaports and airports, he added.

 Similarly, India had expertise in infotech, which it could export to Germany. There was also a lot of scope for Indian companies to invest in east Germany, which was undergoing a restructuring process, Clement said.

 The minister said small and medium enterprises played a major role in the German economy and there was scope for co-operation with Indian enterprises in this sector. The minister said Germany and the US were poised for a breakthrough on clean coal technology and this would also be made available to India.

 Both ministers felt that the two countries should work for doubling bilateral trade from the current level of 6 billion euros to 12 billion euros. 

 It has also been decided that the Indo-German Business Commission would meet at least once in two years, while the various working groups would meet more often. The present meeting has been held after a gap of five years. Clement said if Indian and German businessmen met more often, they would also do more business together.

 Deluge drowns drug stocks worth crores

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Stock taking

 Mumbai, Aug. 2: The pharmaceutical industry is understood to have suffered losses to the tune of Rs 1,000 crore due to damaged drug stocks caused by last weeks deluge in Mumbai and parts of Maharashtra. 

 Several godowns that stored medicines were inundated. Most of these godowns are located in the township of Bhiwandi, also known for its powerlooms, and their destruction has raised serious concerns about the shortage of medicines. There are worries that the heavy downpour could give rise to widespread water-borne diseases, leading to a higher demand of antibiotics, injections and vitamins.

 However, industry watchers are not pressing the panic button as yet. They point out that there is adequate supply of critical medicines as of now and are looking at transporting them from other parts of the state in case of any urgency.

 So far big pharmaceutical companies, such as Cipla, Pfizer, Nicholas Piramal and FDC, have confirmed that their godowns in Bhiwandi have been severely affected by the floods. 

 A spokesperson of Pfizer India put the initial estimates of damaged drug stocks of the company at around Rs 100 crore on account of its inundated central warehouse at Bhiwandi. The official, however, added that the company was trying all means to ensure easy availability of its stocks in Mumbai and other flood-affected areas in Maharashtra. 

 We are getting supplies from other clearing and forwarding (C amp;F) locations and our hubs. There has been no damage to our manufacturing facilities, she said, adding that the damaged stocks were insured.

 Cipla sources said while the company had drug stocks of around Rs 100 crore at the Bhiwandi godown, it is now in the process of assessing the damage.

 However, its not the pharmaceutical companies alone that have been hit by the deluge. Both retail chemists and wholesalers were also set back by damaged stocks worth several crores of rupees. Unlike the pharmaceutical companies, many of the retail chemists are not insured.

 According to J.S. Shinde, general secretary, All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists (AIOCD), the losses suffered by chemists could be around Rs 20 crore and for wholesalers, it could be Rs 35 crore. He puts the total number of retail chemists in Maharashtra at around 40,000 with majority of them are in Mumbai and Konkan regions.

 Shinde said though there is no scarcity of medicine at present, its critical that stocks are replenished in 8-10 days. If this is not done, we could face shortage of antibiotics and other medicines, he added, noting that supplies to Mumbai can be restored from C amp;F agents in Pune and Nagpur.

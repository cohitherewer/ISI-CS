 Calcutta, Feb. 2: Singapore is eyeing investments and collaborations in the information technology (IT) sector in Bengal.

 A delegation comprising four IT companies and representatives of the IDA, a nodal agency for planning policy formulation, regulation and development of IT in Singapore, met the Bengal IT department officials today. The delegation was in Calcutta to identify areas of co-operation and investment opportunities, mainly in the IT and related sectors.

 Ascendas, a Singapore-based infrastructure company, plans to set up an IT park in Calcutta, similar to those in Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai and Gurgaon.

 Ascendas officials had met Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya six months back and requested for 20 acres of land. The project, which has been delayed due to land allotment issues, is estimated to cost between Rs 280 crore and Rs 300 crore. However, an agreement for the project is likely to be finalised soon. 

 IDA representative N. S. Somashekhar said Singapore companies were interested in offering applications and services, especially in e-governance, traffic and fleet management, defence, online security and communication systems. 

 Four companies ? Crimson Logic, CET Technologies, E-COP and SES ? today made presentations before the government and industry members.

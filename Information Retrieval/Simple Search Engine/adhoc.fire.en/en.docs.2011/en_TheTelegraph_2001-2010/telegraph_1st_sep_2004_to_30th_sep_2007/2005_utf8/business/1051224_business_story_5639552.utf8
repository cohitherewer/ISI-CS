 ONGC output skids on Mumbai High

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, Dec. 23: The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation has failed to meet its targeted crude oil production during November, as the output from Mumbai High field has still not been restored to its normal level after the explosion in July, and Assam continues to be a troubled spot. 

 Official data shows that ONGC produced 80 per cent and 75.6 per cent of the targeted crude output for Mumbai High and Assam, respectively. 

 Oil India Ltd (OIL) has fared better in Assam with an output of 0.267 million tonnes for the month, which is 97.4 per cent of the target. It failed to meet the target, as there was a fire at its Dikom-15 well in September.

 ONGC has produced 0.102 million tonnes of crude and cited the poor law and order situation in the state as the main reason for the low output. 

 The two companies appear to be handling the ground situation differently. While OIL is taking things in its stride, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation is bogged down with the political situation in the state. 

 ONGC chairman Subir Raha met Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi recently and solicited his help. 

 He told Gogoi that the company is ready with a Rs 3,300-crore war chest to double its crude output in Assam from 1.5 million tonnes to 3 million tonnes per year during the next three years. However, the law and order situation will determine whether the funds will actually flow in.

 The performance during November was worse than the five-month period between April and August when 82.6 per cent of the companys target was achieved.

 ONGC is the biggest employer in Assam and senior officials feel that All Assam Students Union activists do not have any case for resorting to strong-arm tactics. 

 In fact, ONGC is reported to be overstaffed in Assam and is under pressure to induct more people for whom there is no work.

 The oil firm spends over Rs 1.50 crore every year on social welfare projects in the state, which is the highest by any corporate.

 According to senior ONGC officials, the security provided by the Assam government to the company is not adequate, particularly in areas adjoining Nagaland and the oilfields in upper Assam.

 Meanwhile, ONGC has exceeded the targeted output for its oilfields in Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu.

 Selling storm sweeps stocks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 29: Stocks went into a tailspin today, shaken by thinning foreign fund flows and a dreary batch of corporate scorecards from some market movers.

 The sensex closed at 6154.44 in a 129-point drop over its previous finish of 6284.20 on a day Lever numbers showed the company was still struggling with profit pangs even as its sales figures pointed to a recovery. 

 The firm?s shares have a 4.1-per cent weightage in the gauge. The index itself opened at 6283.07, fell to an intra-day low of 6138.47 and closed at 6154.44 in a 2.06 per cent loss.

 Foreign investors have hastened the slide, dumping shares to the tune of Rs 189.40 crore on Tuesday and Wednesday. Bank stocks and other metal firms were big losers.

 Market watchers attribute the selling pressure to a rush among investors to make the best of attractive prices in the cash market; some week-end squaring up also hit indices. 

 Brokers said share prices in the cash segment were alluring. In the futures section, they were ruling at discount ahead of the dividends to be paid by firms.

 Among the major losers today were bank stocks. This was evident in the fact that the BSE Bankex shed 104.13 points or 2.89 per cent to 3504.33 from 3608.46. Analysts say bank stocks fell on fears that rising bond yields would crimp profits. 

 State Bank of India shares slid 3.2 per cent to Rs 584.80 while ICICI Bank?s fell to Rs 360.20. 

 The volume of business on BSE slipped to Rs 1,850.33 crore from Rs 1,911.18 crore on Thursday. Tata Steel clocked the highest turnover of Rs 118.56 crore, followed by Reliance Industries (RIL) at Rs 96.17 crore. The Reliance Industries stock gave up 14.95 to Rs 527.70 and Tata Steel by Rs 2.65 to Rs 340.8. 

 Asian markets were weak too, taking a cue from the 1-per cent slide in New York on fresh concerns over the US economy.

 Rupee hardens

 The rupee surged to a two-and-half-month high at 43.54 after market speculation of a revaluation of the Chinese yuan led to heavy dollar sales. It closed at 43.71 on Thursday.

 Calcutta, Oct. 4: The Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC) will take China head on in the US market by creating product awareness and reducing transit time. The council also plans to offer outsourced engineering solutions and product designs to US firms.

 The council has set up a business promotion centre ? India Engineering Centre (IEC) ? in Chicago to showcase the manufacturing skill and capabilities of Indian engineering companies. The centre has 60 booths, which will be increased to 150.

 The IEC will serve as a display, distribution and warehousing centre for Indian engineering products. Sixty companies have already booked space at the centre. The IEC will also arrange buyer-seller meets, participate in exhibitions, one-to-one meets and video conferencing between traders, EEPC chairman Rakesh Shah said.

 The centre will allow Indian traders to access smaller buyers who do not come to India on a regular basis unlike larger traders. The US is Indias largest trading partner. The trade potential in the engineering sector alone is estimated at $100 billion.

 The warehousing facility will help us reduce the transit time from 3-5 weeks to a few days. This will help Indian companies compete with Chinese and Brazilian firms with on-time delivery, said Shah. The idea is to build up the USP of our products. We expect to see a 30-40 per cent growth with the IEC facility.

 The council has identified auto components, castings, forging, scientific and surgical instruments and stainless steel ware as major product categories.

 The EEPC is targeting exports of $18 billion by March 2006. By September, $9 billion worth of engineering products have been traded.

 We also plan to set up a second centre at Johannesburg, which is the gateway to the African and Latin American markets, said Shah.

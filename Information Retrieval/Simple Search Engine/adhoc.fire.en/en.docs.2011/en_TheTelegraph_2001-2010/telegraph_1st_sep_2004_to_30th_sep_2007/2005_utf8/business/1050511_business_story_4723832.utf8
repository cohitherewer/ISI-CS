 Eye on CESC stake

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

Calcutta, May 10: Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) is open to the idea of picking up a minority stake in the RPG-controlled CESC. 

 ?We are keen on picking up stakes in infrastructure companies, in which we already have some exposure. CESC may be one of them. But nothing has been finalised yet,? IDFC chief Rajiv B. Lall said.

 IDFC has handed out Rs 270 crore as loans to CESC and has plans to lend another Rs 130 crore, taking its exposure to Rs 400 crore.

 IDFC provides funds for distribution and transmission systems of CESC.

 ?We want to develop a long-term relationship with CESC. There have been discussions on their expansion plans. However, no financial commitment has yet been made,? Lall added.

 New Delhi, Sept. 13: Two days away from the close of bidding for the Delhi and Mumbai airports, most bidders, including Reliance-Kuala Lumpur Airport, GMR-Frankfurt Airport and Essel-TAV Airports, indicated they would stay in the fray. 

 Only one bidder, Hotchief Airport, which was partnering the Piramals and L amp;T, has followed the Bharti-Changi combine in expressing its unwillingness to bid. 

 Changi Airport today came out with a statement that it withdrew because of a disagreement with its Indian partners over several issues that cropped up during the bidding process. 

 Changi had specifically objected to being asked to pick up the bank guarantee tab of $80 million as the airport operator. 

 Last week, when the consortium had placed before the Indian government its concerns over the guarantee, officials had said: If any combine wants to share the guarantee costs equally, that is their look-out. The government will not stand in the way.

 Hochtief, too, appears to have pulled out because of the hefty penalty condition. 

 But civil aviation ministry officials said it was difficult to change bid norms at such a late stage merely to accommodate one or two players. They added that performance guarantees were usually the norm in most global bids.

 Subhash Chandra-promoted Essel and the Hyderabad based GMR are expected to submit their bid documents by tomorrow, while Reliance is expected to do so on the last day. 

 The Essel group also came out with a statement that the guarantee clause would keep non-serious contenders out the fray.

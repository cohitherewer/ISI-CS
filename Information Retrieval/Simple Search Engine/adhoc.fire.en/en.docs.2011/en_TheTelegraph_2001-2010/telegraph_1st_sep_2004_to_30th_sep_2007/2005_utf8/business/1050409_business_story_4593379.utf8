 Centre offers surety for Dabhol revival

 New Delhi, April 8: The government has offered financial institutions (FIs) a guarantee in the settlement of foreign loans extended to Dabhol Power Company, plucking out one of the main irritants in refurbishing what was once billed as India?s largest FDI showpiece.

 ?It is hoped that this will help all stake-holders settle these issues early,? a spokesperson said after the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs here today.

 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, who chairs the group of ministers trying to find ways to revive the dormant project, said talks were being held with all ?parties concerned? to get them to resolve the issue amicably.

 The project was set up in two phases. In the first, 740 MW was to be generated with naphtha, although LNG was finally picked as the feedstock. This was true of the second phase, too.

 Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) promised to buy 90 per cent of the energy generated but went back on its word after disputes between the state government and Dabhol Power over the price of electricity.

 Over the past three years, Indian institutions, which have lent the project over Rs 6,000 crore, have been struggling to revive it with GE and Bechtel. 

 MSEB?s purchase obligations for both phases was guaranteed by the government of Maharashtra. The centre had counter-guaranteed some provisions in the first phase, though this was capped at $300 million in case of termination and Rs 1500 crore for unpaid energy bills. 

 The process of untying the Dabhol knot was hastened after the UPA government assumed office. One of the steps taken was to set up a panel of ministers to look into the issue. The cabinet secretariat was also roped in.

 However, in its four meetings, the group of ministers could not say how far it was from a headway. It did, however, ask state-owned companies like NTPC and Gail to help restart the plant, and urged domestic lenders to buy offshore debts. 

 The panel also cleared a special purpose vehicle, with IDBI in the driver?s seat, to be set up by the public sector companies.

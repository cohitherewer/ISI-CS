 FIL serves all-seasons fruit drink

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, May 25: FIL Industries Ltd has launched TUK3, the all-seasons fruit drink with a unique combination of Seabuckthorn (Ladakh Berry), Kashmiri apples, and the choicest Indian mangoes.

 TUK3 has been unveiled under Fruitful, the umbrella brand of the juice division of FIL Industries. The product is priced at Rs 10, packed in a 200ml Tetra Brik, aseptic pack. 

 TUK3 is targeted at the young consumer who will enjoy its distinct, tangy taste, additional nutritional value and the exciting new flavour.

 TUK3 is made of an innovative fruit-drink formulation, which we are confident will appeal to the Indian consumer. With the launch of this drink, we hope to capture a sizeable share of the fruit-drink market, which is growing at an approximate rate of 25 per cent, said Lokesh Naidu, vice-president, sales and marketing, FIL.

 TUK, the name of the drink comes from the tongue-clacking sound produced to express a distinct, taste-bud hitting lingering sensation, which is aimed to attract kids.

 The fruit content in TUK3 makes it a natural energiser.

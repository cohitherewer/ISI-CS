 Calcutta, Nov. 30: ICICI Bank has appointed JM Morgan Stanley as a stabilising agent for its public issue to protect retail investors from fluctuating share prices in a volatile market. The financial services firm will buy the banks shares for a month after allotment whenever the rate falls below the issue price.

 The total size of the domestic public issue along with the greenshoe option is Rs 5750 crore.

 We want retail investors to participate in our issue in a big way. Therefore, we are offering a greenshoe option of Rs 750 crore, ICICI Bank executive director Nachiket Mor said.

 If the sensex falls, the price of the scrip will come down. Given the size of the issue, price volatility in the ICICI Bank scrip is expected.

 ICICI Banks book-built public issue, which will open on December 1, has a price band of Rs 505-545.

 The bank will offer shares to Japanese investors without getting listed in Japan as part of its upcoming Rs 2,300-crore issue of American depository shares (ADS).

 Mor said the bank was adopting this route since present regulations do not permit listing on Japanese bourses.

 He said the public and ADS issues were part of the banks capital raising exercise.

 Mor also outlined the banks growth plans. ICICI Bank has identified three broad growth areas ? retail, international and rural.

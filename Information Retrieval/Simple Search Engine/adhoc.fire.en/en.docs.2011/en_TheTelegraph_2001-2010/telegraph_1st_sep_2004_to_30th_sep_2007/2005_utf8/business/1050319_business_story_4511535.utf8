 SEEMA GUHA

 New Delhi, March 18: Health activists at home and abroad have opposed the changes in the patent laws recommended by the Manmohan Singh government.

 Medecins Sans Frontiers (MSF) president Rowan Gillies has written to President Abdul Kalam to ensure that the new bill does not block access to medicines for AIDS patients in poor countries, which are dependent on cheap drugs produced by Indian pharmaceutical companies. MSF is a French non-government organisation, which helps the sick and wounded in troubled areas all over the world.

 Gillies has highlighted the difference cheaper Indian drugs have made for AIDS patients in African countries. ?As a humanitarian organisation providing medical assistance and relief in nearly 80 countries around the world, MSF is asking for your support to ensure that patients in developing countries will continue to have access to affordable medicines.? Copies of the letter have also been forwarded to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi.

 ?We appeal to you that any amendments to the law will safeguard not only citizens of India, but also the millions of children, women and men in the developing world whose lives depend on access to affordable generic medicines,? the letter said. Gillies said of the 700,000 people who currently receive anti-retroviral treatment in the developing world, 50 per cent get affordable Indian generic medicines, as those produced by multinational companies are beyond the reach of the poor.

 ?The availability of fixed-dose combination therapy (or three-in-one pills) has revolutionised AIDS treatment, a fact we have witnessed first-hand in our programmes. Providing this user-friendly form of treatment has only been possible because there are no patent constraints in India on putting these medicines together in one tablet,? Gillies said in his letter. 

 As a member of the World Trade Organisation, India had no choice but to bring in amendments to its patent laws before January 1 2005, when the TRIPS agreement came into force. The UPA government brought in an ordinance on December 31, which has now been placed in Parliament in the form of a bill.

 A-I issue adviser by month-end

 Mumbai, June 3 (PTI): Air-India is set to appoint an adviser by the end of this month for drawing up the roadmap for its initial public offering (IPO). 

 The state-owned carrier is contemplating to hit the capital market by December 2005.

 The airline has already sought expression of interest (EoI) for appointment of advisers and some of the entities have spoken to us, V. Thulasidas, chairman of the airline told reporters here today.

 The last date for filing the expression of interest is June 17.

 Asked about the timing for the IPO, Thulasidas said the company hopes to tap the market before end of this calendar year.

 On the issue of finalising the balance sheet according to global standards, Thulasidas said Air-India would follow the trend adopted by Indian companies.

 Later, referring to the any changes in its fares due to drop in aviation turbine fuel prices in the domestic market, Thulasidas said there was no fare revision on the cards. 

 The company procures only one-third of its fuel requirements from the local markets and two-third is bought from international markets, he said.

 Though the domestic prices of the fuel are down, they are still higher than the international prices, Thulasidas added.

 The airline has the permission to hedge the prices but it is yet to exercise it, he said.

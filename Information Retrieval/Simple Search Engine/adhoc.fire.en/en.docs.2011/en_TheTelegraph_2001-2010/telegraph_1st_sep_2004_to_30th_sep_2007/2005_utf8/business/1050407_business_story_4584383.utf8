 Panna push to ONGC sales

 Supply chain 

 New Delhi, April 6 (PTI): Oil and Natural Gas Corporation?s revenues will increase by about Rs 1,000 crore from this fiscal after it began direct marketing of natural gas produced from Panna/Mukta and Tapti fields in the western offshore from April 1, senior officials said.

 ONGC and its partners, Reliance Industries and the BG group of the UK, will sell 4.8 million standard cubic meters per day of gas directly at $4.08 per million British thermal unit (Btu) and the remaining 6 MMSCMD will be sold to Gail at $3.86 per million Btu for supply to the existing fertiliser and power plants on the Hazira-Bijapur-Jagdishpur pipeline.

 Prior to this, the gas was being sold to Gail as a government nominee, at $3.11 per million Btu. The increased price will result in an additional revenue of $120 million for the joint venture.

 ?ONGC topline will improve by Rs 1,000 crore per year. Till March 31, it had to make good the difference between the JV gas price of $3.11 per million Btu and consumer price of Rs 2,850 per thousand cubic meters. The subsidy borne by ONGC was Rs 750 crore a year,? officials said.

 With direct marketing of gas and withdrawal of subsidy, ONGC will gain an additional revenue of Rs 200-250 crore per annum on account of the higher gas price, besides savings of about Rs 750 crore towards subsidy.

 Officials said according to the production sharing contract for the fields, the ceiling price for the gas payable by Gail to JV partners could be raised on completion of seven years of first production.

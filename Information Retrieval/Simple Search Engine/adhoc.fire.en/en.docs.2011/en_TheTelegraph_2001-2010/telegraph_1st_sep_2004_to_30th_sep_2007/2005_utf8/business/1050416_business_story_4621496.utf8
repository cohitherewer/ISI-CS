 Bharat Forge GDR priced at $27.50

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 15: Bharat Forge, the Pune-based auto component major, has priced its $100-million GDR issue at $27.50. 

 The global depository receipt issue includes a $10-million greenshoe option. One GDR represents one equity share of the company.

 Bharat Forge also announced the offering and pricing of two tranches of foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCB) of $60 million each. The bonds have a maturity of 5 years and 1 day. 

 While the Tranche I bonds are convertible at Rs 1680.53 per share, which represents a 40 per cent premium on the GDR price, the Tranche II bonds are convertible at Rs 1920.60 per share, representing a premium of 60 per cent.

 Both the GDRs and FCCBs are proposed to be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. Citigroup and JP Morgan acted as joint lead managers and book-runners to the offering.

 The Bharat Forge scrip today ended at Rs 1246.60 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today after opening at Rs 1320 and hitting an intra-day low of Rs 1230.

 The Bharat Forge board had earlier okayed the company?s plan to raise resources of up to $300 million through the issue of appropriate securities. The money is being raised to fund its ambitious growth plans. The board had then given its approval to splitting the value of its Rs 10 equity shares to Rs 2.

 The company, which has been in the news for its overseas acquisitions, last year acquired 100 per cent of a German auto parts company in an all-cash deal worth euro 6.30 million. The acquisition marked the entry of the flagship company of the over $1-billion Kalyani group into the fast-growing aluminium auto-component business. 

 It also strengthened the companys position in the global passenger car and chassis component market. 

 Prior to that, Bharat Forge had acquired the German operations of Carl Dan Peddinghaus GmbH, which was since renamed as Bharat Forge GmBH. 

 The company later invested around Rs 30 crore in its German plants.

 Merger buzz around IPCL

 New Delhi, June 7 (PTI): The end of a shareholder agreement on the acquisition of Indian Petrochemicals Corporation (IPCL) has touched off speculation on whether the one-time state-owned firm will be merged with Reliance Industries, which snapped it up three years back. 

 The pact, which ran its course over the weekend, was signed between the government and the Ambanis. It gave the Centre the right to nominate directors on the IPCL board.

 Asked if the petrochem company would be merged with Reliance, a company spokesperson said from Mumbai: The company will evaluate all options at an appropriate time after taking necessary regulatory approvals. 

 Reliance acquired 26 per cent in IPCL from the government for Rs 1491 crore in 2002. This was followed by purchases of another 20 per cent through an open offer.

 The government will have to decide on the two directors that it has on the IPCL board, which will hold its AGM on June 27. No view has been taken, an official of the ministry of chemicals said. Asked if IPCL could be merged with another Reliance firm without the governments nod, he said, The decision will be governed by company law.

 Part of the differences between the Ambani brothers stems from IPCL, whose board Anil quit in a huff and sparked off a furore over the way his resignation was handled. The company also came into focus when Reliance Capital sold its stake in Reliance Petroinvestments ? which controls 46 per cent in IPCL.

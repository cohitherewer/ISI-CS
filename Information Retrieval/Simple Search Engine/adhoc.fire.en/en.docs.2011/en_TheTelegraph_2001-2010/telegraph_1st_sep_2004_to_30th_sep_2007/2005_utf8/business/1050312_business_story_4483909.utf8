 Stake rejig at ICICI Prudential

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 11: ICICI Bank and Prudential of the United Kingdom today announced a restructuring in the shareholding of their joint venture firm ? Prudential ICICI Asset Mutual fund. ICICI Bank will purchase from Prudential an additional 6 per cent of the paid-up equity capital and raise its stake to 51 per cent.

 Prudential ICICI AMC claims to be the number 1 private sector mutual fund company in India, with a market share of 11.4 per cent.

 In a joint statement, ICICI Bank said it has agreed in principle to purchase from Prudential an additional 6 per cent share of the paid-up equity capital of Prudential ICICI AMC and Prudential ICICI Trust Limited, the trustee company for Prudential ICICI Mutual Fund.

 The transaction will bring ICICI group?s share to 51 per cent, while Prudential will hold 49 per cent. The transaction is subject to the approval of the Securities and Exchange Board of India and such other approvals as may be required.

 ?Both partners reiterate their continuing commitment to the growth of their successful partnership in the life insurance and asset management joint ventures. Both partners also look forward to the opening up of the pensions sector and to the further strengthening of their relationship in the life insurance joint venture as regulations permit,? the two partners said.

 Analysts tracking the mutual fund sector say, that the acquisition price is generally 4-to-6 per cent of the total value of the funds managed by the mutual fund. In the case of Prudential ICICI Mutual Fund, the total assets under management is around Rs 18,000 crore. Thus a conservative estimate would peg the price at Rs 48 crore to Rs 64 crore.

 Prudential entered into a joint venture agreement with the erstwhile ICICI Limited in 1997 and since then the asset management has grown rapidly with assets increasing from Rs 160 crore in 1998 to Rs 17900 crore as at December 31, 2004.

 Of late, a spate of initial public offerings from mutual funds has attracted a lot of interest from investors.

 Kotak Mutual Fund, Tata Mutual Fund and Franklin Templeton have launched funds in the primary market.

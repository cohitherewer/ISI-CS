 Posco deal to be finalised soon

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, May 27: Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik today indicated that an agreement with South Korean steel major Posco will be signed soon.

 Patnaik, who led a team of senior bureaucrats, including chief secretary Subas Pani, to hold discussions with the visiting Posco team, said: The matter has moved forward. 

 Posco president Chang Oh Kang was also optimistic. However, neither the chief minister nor the company president specified the date on which the deal will be signed. 

 At $12 billion, the proposed steel plant project by Posco would be the largest-ever foreign direct investment, surpassing the $3-billion deal with power major Enron. 

 After an hour-long meeting with state government officials, Kang said, We would decide on the MoU after returning to South Korea. He, however, said Posco would resolve the issues soon.

 The Posco president stuck to his earlier proposal of swapping Orissas iron ore with high quality ones from Brazil. To bring in efficiency, importing iron ore from overseas and exporting an equal tonnage of ore from Orissa is inevitable, he said. 

 Posco had initially sought an assurance for export of one billion tonnes of iron ore, accounting for about one-third of the states total iron ore reserves. The Korean steelmaker needed just 600 million tonnes for its steel plant and sought permission to export 400 MT to its plant in Korea.

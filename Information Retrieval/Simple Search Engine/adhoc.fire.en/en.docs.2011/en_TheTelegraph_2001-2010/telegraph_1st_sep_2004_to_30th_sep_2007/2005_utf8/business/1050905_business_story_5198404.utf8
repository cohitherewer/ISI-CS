 Firms hang up on number portability

 M RAJENDRAN

 TALK OF THE TOWN

 New Delhi, Sept. 4: Telecom operators have reacted frostily to the concept of number portability ? a facility designed to allow a phone subscriber to flit from one operator to another and carry his original phone number along.

 The telecom regulator had come out with a consultation paper on the burning issue and invited suggestions from the industry and all other stakeholders. When the deadline for submitting suggestions ended on August 30, the regulator received only 11 suggestions.

 Here?s how it stacks up: the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has received suggestions from one major operator, an apex body of mobile operators, three consumer groups, one research and analysis outfit and five US-based companies that offer technical solutions on number portability.

 Trai officials said they will include a few more but refused to reveal the final number. A senior Trai member said, ?Normally, we tend to accommodate a few late comments till the open house is held on the subject.? Sources in Trai said the serious stakeholder do not submit their suggestions late.

 Mobile operators have been opposed to the idea of introducing number portability, while customers have been demanding immediate implementation.

 The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), the apex body that represents GSM operators like Bharti and Hutch, has sought a minimum time of four months before any discussion can be initiated. COAI director general T.V. Ramachandran said, ?We believe that it is necessary for us to undertake/commission a detailed study on the issue of number portability and its relevance in the present Indian scenario.?

 The COAI has reminded the regulator that in the past it had utilised services of overseas consultants in matters of consumer interest and said the same practice should be followed in the present instance as well. Meanwhile, the COAI is likely to commission an expert agency to carry out a study on the issue. ?Such an exercise will take at least four months,? Ramachandran said.

 The Trai claims that number portability has been successfully implemented in various countries with over 100 per cent teledensity like the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland and Hong Kong. The COAI argues that the countries cited by the regulator as examples in the consultation paper have the worst practices in number portability (France Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and the UK).

 Badri Agarwal, president of Broadband Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd, has said in the company?s response that from a global perspective, fixed number portability has been brought in vogue by regulators almost always before the introduction of MNP. 

 By the very nature of these services, the portability factor in-principle gives real and tangible advantages to the fixed service compared with mobile services.

 Voice, a leading consumer organisation, supports the Bharti claim. Col. S.N. Aggarwal (retd.), telecom advisor to Voice, says, ?We receive far more complaints from mobile subscribers than fixed-line users. It is not only the poor service, but indifferent attitude of operators towards subscribers? problems. The consumer has been tied down in the absence of number portability.?

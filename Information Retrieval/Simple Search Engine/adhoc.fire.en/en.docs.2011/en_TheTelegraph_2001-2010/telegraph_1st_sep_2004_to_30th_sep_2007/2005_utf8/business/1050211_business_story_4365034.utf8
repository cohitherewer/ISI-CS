 UB, Shaw Wallace in high spirits on bourses

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 10: Liquor companies like Shaw Wallace and McDowell amp; Company were on a high on bourses today on news of consolidation in the industry.

 Both these counters witnessed hectic activity and they were locked in at the upper circuit with no sellers in sight. 

 Shares of Shaw Wallace opened at Rs 192.50 and closed at Rs 204.15, a gain of 10 per cent over its last close. The counter saw 6731 trades with 14.91 lakh shares being transacted. The Shaw Wallace scrip has risen 20 per cent over the past two trading sessions.

 McDowell?s shares opened at Rs 141.45 and closed at Rs 153.05, again a rise of 10 per cent.

 The buying came amid reports that the UB group could mount a hostile bid for Shaw Wallace though an open offer. ?There are speculations that there could be an open offer and even a counter offer,? a broker said.

 It may be recalled that the UB group had emerged as the highest bidder for the liquor business of Shaw Wallace. 

 Reports here said that UB had hired Accenture to help it formulate its bid, while Shaw Wallace mandated McKinsey to conduct the bidding process. 

 Subsequently, Vijay Mallya had said that if the UB group were to secure the transaction it would consolidate the spirits business. Such a move would make the Bangalore-headquartered group, the second largest spirits company in the world from its current fourth position.

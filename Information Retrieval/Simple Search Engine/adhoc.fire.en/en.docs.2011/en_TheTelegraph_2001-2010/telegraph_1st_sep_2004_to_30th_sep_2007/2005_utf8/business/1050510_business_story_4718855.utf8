 TCS mulls London listing

 Ramadorai: Upbeat

 London, May 9 (PTI): Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) may list itself on the London Stock Exchange (LSE), its chief executive Subramanian Ramadorai has hinted. 

 Sources said, the company is also talking to the New York Stock Exchange and Deutsche Borse, but it is keen on LSE because ?its culture fit TCS?.

 Stating that London is a very important market, Ramadorai said, ?They (LSE officials) keep persuading us to go to London. They say things like Sarbanes Oxley is a nightmare. Everybody does their own sales pitch.?

 Sarbanes Oxley is a financial and accounting disclosure norm mandated by the US Securities and Exchange Commission for companies who would list on the US exchanges. It is also mandatory to follow it for the existing listed companies.

 The information technology company from the Tata stable has been at the forefront in persuading British companies to outsource their work to India. Among its clients are British Telecom and British Airways. TCS is also a part of the consortium that is building the new NHS computer system.

 Ramadorai said the memorandum of understanding signed between India and UK last month made Britain a more attractive place for Indian companies seeking listing on a stock exchange abroad. The memorandum emphasises a sharp increase in the number of flights between the two countries from an existing 40 per week to 130. ?We, as a foreign company, are very comfortable doing business in UK,? Ramadorai said. The firm already has eight offices in Britain, with its biggest site being in Guildford.

 He said the company has to be ?sensitive? about a possible backlash over jobs going to India, but added viewing the Indian outsourcing phenomenon as ?taking away jobs? was a ?very wrong perspective?.

 ?If you see some of the research and development capabilities in India, you see why some of these companies are doing what they are doing,? he said.

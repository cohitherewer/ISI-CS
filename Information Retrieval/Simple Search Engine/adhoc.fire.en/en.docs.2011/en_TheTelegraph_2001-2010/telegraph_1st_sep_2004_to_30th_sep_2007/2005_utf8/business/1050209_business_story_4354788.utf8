 Frauds office gets busy

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 8: The Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) has started the process of filing criminal cases against errant companies that were referred to it when it was created in late 2003.

 The office of the SFIO was created to deal with cases of fraud and defalcation where the nature of the offence was so serious that it mandated a referral to the SFIO.

 For other cases of default, there is a mechanism within the ministry of company affairs (MCA) to deal with the offence. 

 Senior officials in the ministry said the SFIO has completed the investigation in the initial batch of cases that were referred to it and are now initiating prosecution. These initial cases include Daewoo Motor Company, Vasta group of companies and two Madhya Pradesh based companies ? Design Auto Systems Ltd and Bonanza Biotech Ltd. 

 Two other cases that were reported to the SFIO were those of DSQ Software and Ispat Industries where the investigations are still going on. Both companies have received stay orders from the courts that have impeded the process of investigation.

 Last December, cases pertaining to 16 Ketan Parekh firms were referred to the SFIO and the investigations have begun. No new case has been referred to the office after that, officials said.

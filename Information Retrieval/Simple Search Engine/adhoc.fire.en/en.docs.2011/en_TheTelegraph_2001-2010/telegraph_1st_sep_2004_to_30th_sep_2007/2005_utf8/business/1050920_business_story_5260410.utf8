 DoT, Trai clash over cell tariffs

 M. RAJENDRAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 19: The department of telecommunications and the telecom regulator are once again on a collision course. This time, it is regarding low tariffs offered by operators for calls within a network. They charge a higher rate for making a call to other networks.

 For example, if you are a subscriber of Reliance mobile and place a call to a friend who is also a Reliance mobile subscriber in the same city, you will be charged just 40 paise per minute under its entry-level scheme. On the other hand, if you call a friend with an AirTel connection, you pay Re 1 per minute. (See chart)

 DoT is against this kind of pricing as it discriminates a telephone subscriber on the basis of the choice of an operator. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), on the other hand, feels that this practice should be allowed since it has motivated the operators to bring down the tariff.

 The regulator is fuelling discrimination and anti-competitive initiatives. This has led to a situation where all operators are forced to follow the call only my network strategy. There are operators who have lower mobile subscribers and higher fixed-line users (like Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd). What will happen if they were to decide to go the same way as mobile operators? DoT sources said.

 There will be a chaos in the telecom market. This will lead to litigation and delays in telecom services reaching rural areas, said sources.

 BSNL has about 15 million mobile subscribers, while all private operators together have a mobile user base of over 50 million. However, BSNL has more than 45 million fixed-line subscribers.

 If the private operators offer free calls within a network and charge a fee for other networks, it will lead to an unbalanced growth in the market. With low entry rates into mobile, a subscriber could be forced to carry different SIM cards to speak to different networks. I hope the regulator has examined this aspect, a senior DoT official said.

 Trai senior member D.P. Seth said, I have no comments to offer. We have already explained our position.

 Trai sources said the decision to allow a lower rate for calls made within an operators network was explained to all the stakeholders.

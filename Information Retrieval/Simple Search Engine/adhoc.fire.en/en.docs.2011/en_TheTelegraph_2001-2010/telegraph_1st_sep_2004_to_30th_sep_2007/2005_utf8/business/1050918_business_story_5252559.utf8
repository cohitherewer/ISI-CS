 Calcutta, Sept. 17: Srei Infrastructure Finance Limited is eyeing a 30 per cent growth in disbursements to over Rs 2,000 crore with a focus on roads, power and renewable energy projects. The infrastructure finance company had disbursed Rs 1,610 crore last year.

 ?We are mainly looking at these areas as the high growth ones and we firmly believe that the renewable energy sector will do well,? said Hemant Kanoria, vice chairman and managing director, Srei Infrastructure Finance Limited. ?We are also upbeat on the decision of the government to support viability gap funding for infrastructure projects on public-private partnerships,? said Kanoria. However, the government grant shall be disbursed only after the private sector firm subscribes to the equity contribution required for such a project.

 ?With the guidelines already in place, we are now identifying such projects which are stuck up due to the lack of viability,? Kanoria mentioned. According to him, there are several stalled infrastructure projects in various sectors like roads, power and ports in which the government has decided to allow private companies for funding to make these projects viable.

 Srei also expects to make money from carbon points trading in near future. ?The penalty points on carbon emission is increasing from 2007. As a result, the value of carbon trading points will also increase,? explained Kanoria.

 The company has 1 per cent gross non-performing assets (NPAs), with zero per cent NPA in the renewable energy and the infrastructure project financing areas. ?Though most people are apprehensive about the repayment capability in rural areas, our experience is that it is an extremely lucrative sector,? Kanoria said.

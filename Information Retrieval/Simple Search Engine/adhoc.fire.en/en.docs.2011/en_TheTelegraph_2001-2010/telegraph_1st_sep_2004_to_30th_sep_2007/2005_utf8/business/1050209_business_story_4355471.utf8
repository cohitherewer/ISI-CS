 Deccan mining firm strikes gold

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 8: Deccan Gold Mines, the only listed gold mining firm on the Bombay Stock Exchange, today said its exploration drive in the Dharwar-Shimoga region and the Hutti belt is yielding good results.

 The company made the announcement at a press meet held for Mark Creasy ? the famous gold prospector from Australia. 

 ?The geological similarities between Deccan Golds prospect areas and those in Australia, where large discoveries have been made, are remarkable,? observes Mark. 

 ?Adoption and implementation of appropriate exploration strategies and programmes by Deccan Gold Mines, gives me reason to believe that gold deposits will soon be unearthed at Deccan Gold?s mines,? he added. 

 A major shareholder in the company, Mark is on his first visit to evaluate the progress made by the company.

 Mark is a legend in the mining industry and has a gallery named after him ? the Mark Creasy Minerals Gallery at the mining hall of fame in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. 

 The mining hall of fame is a visible icon for prospectors and miners of Australia and reflects the importance of an industry that contributes enormously to the social and economic wealth of that country.

 ?Mark has just completed a field trip to Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh and is impressed with the development of Deccan Gold?s ventures. He will be visiting Maharashtra and Central India soon, besides providing more inputs on exploration strategies and programmes,? said Charles Devenish, chairman of Deccan Gold Mines.

 Mark shot to fame with his discovery of the Bronzewing and Jundee gold mines. The two mines have produced over 4.5 million ounces of gold.

 Housing faces 3.5% service tax hit

 New Delhi, March 6: Housing costs in large residential complexes will rise by about 3.5 per cent because of the service tax that finance minister P. Chidambaram had imposed in the budget for 2005-06 he presented on Monday.

 The government will soon come out with a detailed notification which will give builders two options: first, they can either calculate the levies and taxes they have already paid on all raw material and services used (such as architects and engineering consultants) and the land on which the housing estate stands, deduct this from the 10 per cent service tax and arrive at the final amount that they need to pay the government.

 Second, in the case of small-time builders who have not kept detailed accounting of their expenses, the government will go by the assumption that they have added about 35 per cent value to the final price of the dwelling unit. The service tax will be levied on the value added which would work out to be 3.5 per cent. On a residence that costs Rs 25 lakh, the service tax will be Rs 87,500. Thus, a Rs 5-lakh unit in Rajarhat will carry a service tax of Rs 17,500. 

 Revenue officials said it is difficult to fix targets on collections from this tax. Hence, collections from all service taxes had been ?limped together?. However, guess-estimates on collections from this tax varies between Rs 200 crore to Rs 400 crore.

 On the other hand, dwelling units bought from builders who are constructing complexes with less than 12 homes will not attract any service taxes. Officials said the majority of units or floors built in any city were in this category and these would not be impacted at all. Resales of old dwelling units will also not attract the service tax.

 Officials said detailed notification on the service tax will be issued soon. 

 ?This is a value added tax and not a product tax imposed on the price tag. It is not the aim to increase prices of properties. The aim is to get people who are otherwise either not paying taxes or under-paying taxes to pay something nearer their real incomes,? they said. Almost all service taxes have been levied to try and raise them from people who were either avoiding income taxes or were undervaluing their incomes. 

 Officials said the service tax could be adjusted in the VAT later. In such cases, buyers would be able to gain the tax relief for the service tax paid by a builder in levies that they pay on final transfer of a dwelling unit.

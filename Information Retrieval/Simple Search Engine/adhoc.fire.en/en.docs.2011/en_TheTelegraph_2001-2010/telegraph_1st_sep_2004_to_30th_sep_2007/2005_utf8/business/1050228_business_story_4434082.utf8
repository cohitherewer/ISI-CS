 Orissa pulls the plug on AES power licence

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Charged up

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 27: The Orissa Electricity Regulatory Commission (OERC) today revoked the licence of the US-based AES for power distribution in the state. 

 AES had operational control of Central Electricity Supply Company (Cesco) till it decided to quit in July 2001. Cesco supplied power to Khurda, Puri, Nayagarh, Cuttack, Jajpur, Jagatsinghpur, Kendrapara, Dhenkanal and Angul districts. 

 The commission?s order came yesterday following a petition from Grid Corporation of Orissa (Gridco), the bulk-power supplier to Cesco. Gridco had sought the revocation of the distribution licence of AES for its failure to pay current dues in full and meet the conditions imposed by the regulator. 

 AES held 51 per cent in Cesco, while the remaining 49 per cent is held by the state through Gridco. Gridco had asked the OERC to cancel the licence of AES because it did not honour the shareholding agreement.

 In its order, the commission rejected the business plan that AES had submitted last October, seeking a return to the Cesco management. 

 Gridco has already rejected the business plan. The move follows the failure of AES to meet the obligations of the licence, OERC sources said.

 However, OERC has kept the order in abeyance till March 31 by giving a chance to AES to meet the conditions by the stipulated date. 

 The conditions include full payment of bulk-supply tariff dues to Gridco from April 1 after meeting necessary costs, including employees salary and reduction of loss as benchmarked by the commission. 

 The licencee owed Gridco over Rs 800 crore towards bulk-supply tariff (BST) at the time it left the management of the distribution company. 

 ?I havent seen the order as yet. But it is extremely unfortunate. The developments are definitely a setback. But we still have time to negotiate with Gridco and the state government,? A. Srinivas Rao, AES business leader for Orissa, told The Telegraph. He, however, admitted that the commissions order would definitely have a bearing on the expansion plans of AES in Orissa.

 In July 2001, AES Corporation had pulled the plug from power distribution in Orissa, citing adverse business climate as the reason. 

 At present, Cesco is being managed under the supervision of the OERC.

 According to the Sovan Kanungo Committee report, when AES left Cesco, it did not pay Rs 600 crore to Gridco towards energy bills and loan instalments. The company walked out without depositing the provident fund and pension contributions of its employees.

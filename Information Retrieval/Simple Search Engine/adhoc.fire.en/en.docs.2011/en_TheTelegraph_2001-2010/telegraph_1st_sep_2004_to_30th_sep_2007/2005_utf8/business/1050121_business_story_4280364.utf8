 IPCL directors urge Anil to stay on 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 20: The ball was lobbed back into Anil Ambani?s court at the IPCL board meeting today when the directors asked him to reconsider his decision to resign.

 Anil, who did not attend the meeting, flew to Delhi for a series of discussions with officials from the finance and power ministries. He was expected in Mumbai late tonight, in time for Reliance Industries? Friday huddle, where it will consider third-quarter results.

 The Reliance vice-chairman is unlikely to change his mind since none of the issues he raised in letters to IPCL chief Mukesh Ambani and independent directors were addressed, said observers watching the Ambani battle. Anil spokespersons declined comment, saying he has not received an official communication from the IPCL board. 

 The board of IPCL, the petrochemicals company acquired by Reliance three years ago, met this afternoon under the chairmanship of Mukesh to consider third-quarter numbers and Anil?s quit-letter of January 3.

 The 12 directors chose not to accept the resignation and, instead, urged him to reconsider it. Among those who sent out the request was Anand Jain, the man Anil blamed for his decision to leave the one-time public sector unit.

 After the meeting, IPCL wrote to exchanges that the resignation of Anil was considered but it was decided that the vice-chairman should be asked to reconsider his stand.

 Ambani watchers believe the lack of response to letters that Anil sent in the past, including the one in which he detailed the reasons for resignation, hardened his resolve to stay away from a meeting where he would not be heard.

 One of the biggest issues raised was the presence of Jain, a Mukesh aid who Anil has accused of dividing the Ambanis. The younger Ambani demanded an independent report on his business dealings with the petrochem firm. He has pointed to a ?conflict of interest? in Jain?s role as an IPCL board-member and distributor.

 On Wednesday, Anil, fighting a bruising battle with Mukesh on ownership issues in the Reliance group, wrote to government nominees on the IPCL board ? G. S. Sadhu and Ramesh Singh ? saying they should ask an independent accounting firm to look into Jain?s links. 

 Early this month, Anil described Jain as a ?modern-day Shakuni?. ?I consider it against my dignity, self-respect and self-esteem to be on the same board as Jain,? the younger Ambani scion said in his letter. Anil said Jain?s dealings were ?improper and contrary to ethical norms and that this had been impacting the business image and reputation of our company.? Anil even asked Mukesh to choose between a brother and a friend, who, he said was sullying the image of the entire group.

 Profit leaps

 IPCL reported a jump of 133 per cent in net profit at Rs 189 crore for the third-quarter ended December compared with Rs 81 crore in the corresponding period in the previous fiscal. 

 On Wednesday, Reliance Energy, a company headed by Anil, reported a 151 per cent surge in profit to Rs 134.22 crore from Rs 53.41 crore for the same quarter of 2003-04. Total income rose to Rs 1134.75 crore from Rs 899.94 crore.

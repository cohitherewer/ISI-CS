 Yell snaps up US phone directory firm

 London, May 17 (Reuters): Britains Yell Group Plc agreed to buy US telephone directory publisher TransWestern for $1.58 billion in cash and reported a surge in full-year adjusted profit. 

 Tuesdays announcement comes as Yells prospects in the UK are under threat from a probe by competition regulators. It means that more than half of the companys revenues and nearly half of its operating profit will now come from the United States. 

 TransWestern, owned by Thomas H. Lee Partners, CIVC Partners and the companys management, has 332 phone directories in 25 states and had revenues of $358 million in 2004. Yell has agreed to a new ?2-billion ($3.7 billion) credit facility, which will refinance all of its bank debt and fund the TransWestern acquisition. Yell owns Britains Yellow Pages and is the largest independent US directory publisher. 

 The TransWestern acquisition follows two days after private equity firms Veronis Suhler Stevenson and 3i Group sold European phone directories publisher YBR to a consortium led by Australias Macquarie Capital Alliance Group for 1.825 billion euros ($2.3 billion). 

 Yell shares rose 1.8 per cent to 405 pence. 

 The company paid a full price for TransWestern, the Numis media team said in a research note. We believe that the acquisition could largely offset any financial impact from potentially negative findings from the UK Competition Commission.

 Yell said turnover for the year ended March 31 rose 8.3 per cent to ?1.29 billion. Analysts on average expected turnover of ?1.28 billion. 

 Adjusted profit after tax, excluding exceptional costs from a lawsuit in the United States, was ?117.0 million, compared with ?60.2 million a year earlier, which excluded costs from Yells initial public offering. 

 On a net basis, Yells profit was ?94.2 million compared with a loss of ?51.1 million a year earlier. 

 Yell operates in Britain under a price cap which limits price increases to six percentage points below the rate of inflation ? a formula that at current inflation rates means the company actually has to cut prices each year. 

 But with the contribution of its Yell.com website the company expects UK turnover to increase by about 3 per cent in 2005. We believe that maintenance of the RPI (Retail Price Index) minus 6 per cent formula is the best outcome Yell can hope for Numis said.

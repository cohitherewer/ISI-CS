 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 14: A team of venture capitalists will help Indian entrepreneurs set up shop in the United Kingdom. 

 The venture capitalists are interested in companies that can boast of a market capitalisation of about $100-200 million in two to three years. 

 The venture capitalists will invest in entrepreneurial talent across all sectors. The United Kingdom receives about 60 per cent of the Indian investments that goes into Europe. 

 The venture capitalists planning to invest in India are looking at startups in the technology space, including life sciences. Start-ups with a potential to gain a market capitalisation of $100-200 million would be the most sought-after, said Alpesh B. Patel, dealmaker, Global Entrepreneur UK Trade and Investment.

 We will help them set up business in the United Kingdom as it will not only give them access to the large European market but also to those in other parts of the globe, said Patel. 

 The venture capitalists are here to participate in the TiEcon conference, a flagship event of the Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE), and to meet entrepreneurs. 

 Dinesh Dhamija, ex-founder and chief executive officer of eBookers, is part of the delegation and has set aside $200 million equity funding for India. We plan to invest in startups which need an investment of $5 million to $30 million. The company should have innovative products and be ready to go west and not wait for the market to come to it.

 Dhamija has invested in about nine Indian companies which operate in technology like Technowate and also in other sectors like infrastructure, hotels and retail. 

 Amadeus Capital Partners, which has invested in more than five telecommunications and software start-ups, is bullish about investment in India.

 Mumbai, July 17: Lupin Ltd is looking at more licensing opportunities to strengthen its position in the paediatric-drug category.

 This comes after its anti-infective oral suspension ? Suprax or cefixime ? was launched in the US market last year. Lupin got the license to sell Suprax from Wyeth, which had stopped marketing the product since March 2003. Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc (LPI), the US subsidiary, has been retailing Suprax.

 The company now wants to build its paediatric category by not only adding more products but also grabbing more such licensing opportunities.

 In an interview to The Telegraph recently, Lupins managing director Kamal K. Sharma said the company is keen on enhancing its franchise for paediatric products. 

 We want to harvest the equity we have created in this product category in future. We will add more products, some from our own stable and some through licensing.

 Suprax was its first branded product in the US, Sharma said. 

 Even in India, it is a challenge to build a brand that will get doctors approval. In the US, one years effort proved good for us.

 Lupin will focus on brands with high growth potential. If a company has many products, its focus will be on some brands. It will not be interested in some other brands. Our focus will be on such brands. Therefore, we will shortlist those brands that can add value to the paediatrician, he added.

 It has entered into an agreement with Allergan Inc to market the latters paediatric version of a conjunctivitis drug. 

 Lupin will look out for brands which have been put on the block.

 The company is focusing on fixed dosages from active pharmaceutical ingredients. The thrust is on exports in addition to research and development. 

 Lupin also wants to penetrate deeper into existing markets as well as venture into virgin territories.

 In new chemical entities (NCEs), the company is focused on anti-migraine, anti-TB and anti-psoriasis therapies.

 Our vision is to be a innovation-led transnational pharma company, said Sharma. 

 Going ahead, the export revenue, which is already 50 per cent of the companys turnover, will further increase. We will move up the value chain in both products and markets, he said, adding the company is eyeing the Japanese market.

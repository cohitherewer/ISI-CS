 End game in sale of UTI-II

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: The cabinet is likely to clear a proposal to sell UTI-II to its four sponsors ? LIC, State Bank of India, PNB and Bank of Baroda ? for about Rs 1,240 crore.

 Finance ministry officials say a note on the sale will come up before the cabinet this week. This is one piece of divestment expected to sail through amid claims from unions that the stock surge should boost UTI-II valuations. UTI sources are looking at Rs 2,500-3,000 crore.

 The planned sale to the consortium follows SBIs inability to buy UTI-II on its own because of laws that prevent banks from owning more than one mutual fund. The countrys largest commercial bank already runs SBI Mutual Fund.

 The finance ministry had long been trying to convince SBI to buy UTI-II, which could be merged with its existing mutual fund, but the efforts did not prove successful.

 Now, there is a realisation that a sale to the four institutions, which run it anyway, would be better as it spreads risks. Sources said there would be a three-year lock-in to hold back the four sponsors from individually, or jointly, selling stakes to a strategic investor.

 The government wants to flog the mutual fund to its own institutions for money that can be invested in social schemes and revival of sick PSUs. 

 In a narrow definition of the term, the sale is not divestment, but it is a selloff, if loss of Parliamentary control and oversight over the fund as a result of the transfer, are considered.

 All government nominees on the board of UTI-II will make way for nominees of the four owners under plans now with the ministry. The promoter-quartet will also pick a chief executive officer, a post lying vacant for some time. 

 UTI-II was carved out when a payments crisis in 2002 led to the split of the mutual fund giant, which could not pay the promised returns of 10.5 and 14 per cent as the stocks it held in its kitty lost value in a falling market. It then dipped into the reserves of schemes, which invested a quarter of their corpus in stocks and the rest in debt.

 Calcutta, Dec. 9: The Edufair has been a big draw in Infocom 2005 organised by Nasscom and Businessworld, an ABP group publication, which has seen a staggering number of footfalls in the first three days.

 The Edufair, which is being held for the first time, has been flooded with students, who have been flocking for guidance and counselling on various subjects from academicians of reputed institutes such as, IIT Kharagpur, BITM, Wigan and Leigh and ICFAI.

 I havent decided whether to go for electronic engineering or computer science. My entrance exams are coming up in 5-6 months. Therefore, I decided to come here and take a look at the IIT Kharagpur stall and get some advice, said Prateek Chatterjee, a student of Std XII.

 The Jobsmart, which will be held on December 10 and 11, will see revered names in the IT industry such as TCS, ICICI OneSource and Genpact on a recruitment drive. 

 Aspirants can drop their CVs for placements at the Jobsmart. The companies have already hosted guidance and counselling sessions on December 7 and 8.

 The exhibition is being held at the Salt Lake stadium grounds. 

 The number of visitors to Infocom 2005, the countrys largest information, communication and technology (ICT) exposition, has already crossed 85,000, with two days still remaining.

 The exposition has brought together software, hardware and communication technology on a common platform. It also has representatives from various other states like Orissa and Jharkhand .

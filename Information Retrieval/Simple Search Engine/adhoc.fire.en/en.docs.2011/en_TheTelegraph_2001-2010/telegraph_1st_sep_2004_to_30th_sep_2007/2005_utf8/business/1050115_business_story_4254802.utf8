 Clamour for mobile technology park

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 NEW RING TONE 

 Calcutta, Jan. 14: The Indian Cellular Association (ICA) wants the government to set up a mobile handsets and components hardware technology park, a modified version of an electronics park.

 ?The handset manufacturing sector is capable of generating 25,000 jobs in India. The industry could produce 30 million units per year, valued between $2.5-3 billion, by 2009. This can be supported by a strong component and accessories industry. The scheme for the technology park can be formulated in due course,? ICA president Pankaj Mohindroo said.

 The association had appointed market research agency KPMG to conduct a survey to assess the feasibility of manufacturing handsets in India. KPMG is expected to table its final recommendations by January-end.

 ?The draft recommendations outline certain policies to drive growth in the manufacturing sector,? says Mohindroo.

 KPMG feels that as the rural sector would play an important role in raising the annual demand for handsets to 50 to 70 million, the government should speed up rural network coverage.

 ?A robust component manufacturing base is critical to position India as a key handset manufacturing hub,? Mohindroo said. 

 ?The government should empower an entity to promote overall electronics manufacturing, and specifically handset and component manufacturing like Taiwan and China.?

 China controls more than 25 per cent of the global production of cellular products. Taiwan is also strong in areas of R amp;D, wireless and broadband equipment.

 A CII delegation had visited Taiwan in August last year to identify areas of mutual co-operation and technology transfer between the two countries. 

 ?We have also recommended a five-year income tax holiday for handset and component manufacturers in India with taxation at half-rate for subsequent five years on the lines of China,? Mohindroo said. 

 ?The government should allow capital goods depreciation for handset manufacturing equipment in three years. A uniform VAT rate of 4 per cent for mobile phones, components and accessories should be implemented across all states,? he said.

 ICA has also requested that the basic customs duty of 5 per cent be removed and be replaced with an additional duty of 5 per cent in the form of countervailing excise duty.

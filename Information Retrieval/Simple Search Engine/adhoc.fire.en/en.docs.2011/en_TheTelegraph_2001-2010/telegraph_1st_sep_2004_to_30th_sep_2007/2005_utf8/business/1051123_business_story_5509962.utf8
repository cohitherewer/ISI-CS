 Lal: Looking ahead

 Mumbai, Nov. 22: Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited is keen on acquiring some of the assets of British Petroleum Plc in East Africa.

 We are already in talks to buy out BPs stake in some of their petroleum ventures in East Africa. At present, we are primarily looking at their downstream assets, but in future we may consider upstream projects, too, said HPCL chairman-cum-managing director M.B. Lal. He was speaking on the sidelines of an energy seminar organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 Since most of our refining activities in India are restricted to the West coast of the country, the East coast of Africa would be geographically ideal for us, explained Lal.

 The Indian oil refiner and marketeer already has a 50-50 joint venture pact with the UK oil major for the construction of Guru Gobind Singh Refinery at Bhatinda in Punjab. The 9-million tonnes per annum refinery will be set up at an estimated cost of Rs 12,000-crore.

 The two companies have signed a letter of intent to form a joint venture. However, the final and the binding agreement will be signed by the end of this fiscal, Lal mentioned.

 Though the refinery is expected to go on stream by 2010, our endeavour will be to complete the project earlier, said Lal. According to him, Rs 330 crore has already been invested and several institutions have evinced interest in providing finance for the project.

 HPCL has also signed a memorandum of understanding with Total Sa of France, one of the worlds largest integrated oil companies, to explore refining opportunities in India. 

 Besides, the company is also negotiating with Royal Dutch Shell Plc to buy out its 26 per cent stake in the 2.5-million tonne LNG import terminal at Hazira along with its rights to market the gas. 

 As the gas prices have moved up substantially, its sourcing and supply will be a critical issue. However, a final decision on the stake purchase is expected within the next couple of months, Lal said.

 HPCL is also setting up a 25 megawatt wind-power plant in Maharashtra at an investment of Rs 100 crore. The power plant is expected to start generation by the end of 2006.

 On the profitability of the company, Lal said, Though the price volatility for crude oil had lessened, it is still difficult to predict profitability because refining margins have fallen by $1.5 per barrel on an average over the last two months.

 The company plans to spend around $1 billion over the next 4-5 years on upstream exploration, Lal revealed. He added that the company would decide in a couple of months on the initial public offering of shares of its exploration arm, Prize Petroleum.

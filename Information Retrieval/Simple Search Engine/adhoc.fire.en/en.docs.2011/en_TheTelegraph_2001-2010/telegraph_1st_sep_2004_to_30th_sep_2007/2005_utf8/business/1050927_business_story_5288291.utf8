 Power cop ignores Reliance Energy plea

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 26: Reliance Energy Transmission Ltd will have to take the competitive bidding route to install transmission lines.

 In a directive, the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) said the second phase of strengthening the western region would be undertaken through competitive bidding.

 Reliance Energy had requested CERC to give it the licence to install transmission lines on its own since PowerGrid was taking a long time to finalise partners.

 The regulator today approved competitive bidding with 100 per cent private sector participation for building transmission lines in the sectors B and C in Gujarat and Maharashtra.

 We are not in favour of giving these licences on a platter to anyone because of delay. Let the lowest bidder win the licences. PowerGrid will call for bids in December and the procedure would be completed in three months, said a senior CERC official.

 There are many private players in the transmission sector and all those who wish to participate should be given a chance. This is also important to bring in transparency in the sector, the official added.

 The successful bidder will be selected on the basis of the lowest completed cost subject to his meeting the specified qualifying requirements in terms of experience, capability and financial standing.

 The procedure had been proposed by the central transmission utility (PowerGrid) based on the directive of the CERC in July this year while disposing of the application of Reliance Energy Transmission.

 The commission had advised PowerGrid to modify its bidding procedure of packages B and C to enable 100 per cent equity participation by private sector players so that equity resources of the central transmission utility could be better utilised elsewhere.

 According to the approved procedure, PowerGrid will invite competitive bids with 100 per cent private equity for eight 400-kv transmission lines spanning a distance of about 1500 km in Maharashtra and Gujarat.

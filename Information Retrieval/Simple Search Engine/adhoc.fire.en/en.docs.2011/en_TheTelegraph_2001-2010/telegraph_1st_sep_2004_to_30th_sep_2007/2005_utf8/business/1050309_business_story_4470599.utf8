 BoR eyes higher value for shares

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 8: Bank of Rajasthan is planning to sell a 9.75 per cent stake to investors at a much higher price than it had offered Societe Generale (SocGen) for the 5 per cent stake.

 The P.K. Tayal-controlled bank is still awaiting a response from SocGen, which had been offered the stake at Rs 85-90 per share. While the owners are mum about the offer price, market grapevine says the bank is looking at a sale price of Rs 125 per share for the 9.75 per cent stake.

 BoR had earlier announced its intention of making a preferential allotment of 14.75 per cent shares to foreign institutional investors (FIIs) or a strategic partner that included a foreign bank. The bank had made presentations to 12 players, comprising four foreign banks and eight FIIs.

 Chairman Pravin Kumar Tayal told The Telegraph that while the bank is awaiting a response from SocGen, the latter has time till April 1 to communicate its decision. Tayal said if SocGen did not communicate its decision by this date, the offer would be ?withdrawn?. He, however, clarified that BoR has, so far, not entered into any formal understanding with the French foreign bank. ?We have not yet signed any MoU,? he said.

 On BSE today, the news of SocGen picking up a 5 per cent stake in the bank saw its shares soaring to an intra-day high of Rs 75.50 after opening at Rs 68. The scrip ended at Rs 71.20, a gain of 6.50 per cent over its previous close.

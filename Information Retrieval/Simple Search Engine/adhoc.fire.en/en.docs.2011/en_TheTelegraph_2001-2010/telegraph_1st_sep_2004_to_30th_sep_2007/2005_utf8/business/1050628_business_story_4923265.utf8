 DVD tech set to get a boost

 Tokyo, June 27 (Reuters): Microsoft Corp and Toshiba Corp said on Monday they will strengthen their joint development of PCs and consumer electronics goods and consider working together on next-generation DVD technology.

 Toshiba, the worlds third-largest notebook PC maker, and Microsoft, the biggest software company, have been working together on developing computers and other mobile devices for several years.

 In May, the two companies announced a cross-licensing agreement they said would allow them to use each others patents on computer and digital electronics technologies, paving the way for a strengthening of their business ties.

 The two firms said on Monday they would consider working together on the development of HD DVD players using Microsoft Windows software, a move that Toshiba hopes will help lower its development costs for the next-generation DVD player.

 We think the agreement will have practical benefits such as lower costs and shorter development times, Toshiba president Atsutoshi Nishida told a news conference in Tokyo also attended by Microsoft chairman Bill Gates.

 Toshiba, Japans second-largest electronics conglomerate, plans to launch HD DVD players in the last quarter of 2005 in Japan and the United States. HD DVD players are based on one of two competing standards for next-generation optical discs, 

 Toshiba is the leader of the HD DVD camp. Sony Corp heads a group favouring a rival technology called Blu-ray. The two sides have waged a three-year battle to have their standards adopted for new DVDs that promise much greater capacity than current discs.

 Gates said Microsoft retained its neutral stance on the format battle, not explicitly supporting either side.

 Ahead of the announcement, shares of Toshiba closed down 2.95 per cent at 427 yen, underperforming a 1.06 per cent fall in the Nikkei average.

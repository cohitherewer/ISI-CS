 Global Suzuki models head for local market

 Tokyo, Feb. 22 (Bloomberg): Suzuki Motor, which makes cars with Maruti in India, plans to develop two global models by 2007 as competition increases with Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motor in Asia?s fourth-largest vehicle market.

 The new models may be bigger than the Suzuki Swift compact car made in Japan, China, India and Hungary, president Hiroshi Tsuda said in Hamamatsu city, southwest of Tokyo.

 The new models would help Suzuki fend off challenges by Toyota, Hyundai Motor and other larger carmakers, which are investing to catch up in India. Suzuki, Japans largest maker of minicars, will also make and sell the models in Europe and Asia to seek new markets.

 ?We want to maintain our 50 per cent share in India,? said Tsuda. ?We aim to release a model that is suitable in four main areas in the US, Europe and Asia excluding Japan.?

 The Swift was Suzuki?s first global model. The compact car, which comes with either a 1.3-litre or 1.5-litre engine, was designed in Europe because customers in ?Japan and other Asian countries tend to favour European designs,? Tsuda said. 

 Suzuki sold 14,016 units of the Swift in the three months since unveiling it in November, more than its 3,000-unit average monthly target.

 Hyundai Motor said it would open a second India factory by 2007 to increase its market share to 20 per cent from 17 per cent. Toyota also plans to sell Daihatsu minicars in India from 2008 onwards, aiming to raise its market share to 10 per cent by 2010 from 1.5 per cent. 

 Maruti and Suzuki will open a second factory in 2007 to increase production capacity by half to 750,000 units a year.

 Suzuki is less profitable than its larger rivals Toyota and Nissan Motor Co, Tsuda said. Toyota has a profit margin of 9.6 per cent while Nissan, Japan?s second-largest carmaker, has an operating margin of 11.1 per cent.

 The carmaker is aiming to buy parts closer to where it makes cars to cut costs. As much as 90 per cent of the Alto minicar is made in India. Suzuki?s profit margin may rise by 0.2 percentage point to 4.5 per cent in the year ending March 31, Tsuda said.

 ?We want to narrow our gap with the top automakers,? Tsuda said. ?It?s going to be our focus in the mid-term business plan? to be unveiled when the company releases its annual earnings in April or May, he said. Suzuki plans to sell the Swift in Hungary in April and will release it for sale in other European countries later. Suzuki is aiming to make 200,000 vehicles a year in Hungary, including the Swift and Ignis.

 Calcutta, Aug. 31: McLeod Russel India Limited has been forced to defer the implementation of its growth plans as the Securities and Exchange Board of India is yet to clear its open offer for Williamson Tea.

 The 62-million-kg tea company plans to acquire estates in India and Kenya as part of its growth strategy.

 McLeod Russel, the BM Khaitan group company, has acquired 70 per cent of Borelli Tea Holdings Limited, the holding company of Williamson Tea Assam.

 According to Sebi requirements, McLeod Russel, along with four other group companies, had made a public announcement on June 1 for an open offer for 20 per cent of Williamson Tea at a price of Rs 145 per share.

 By June 30, the company had sent a draft letter of offer to Sebi where McLeod Russel proposed to make the open offer on August 1.

 The unnecessary delay is stalling our plans. There are no pending issues with Sebi. The market regulator has not answered us as of date. I feel that Sebi is flooded with other public issues and therefore the delay, McLeod Russel managing director Aditya Khaitan said on the sidelines of the companys annual general meeting.

 The company has deposited Rs 42 crore in the bank on July 13 for the open offer, according to Sebi guidelines. The money is lying idle in the bank, he added.

 Earlier, chairman B.M. Khaitan told shareholders that the export prospects of the company is looking up and the group expects to export 22 million kg of tea in the current financial year.

 This will make us the largest producer exporter in the country, he added.

 However, the chairman lamented over the fall in prices. The price of our tea has fallen by Rs 2.50 per kg, he said.

 The company has been constantly uprooting its tea bushes since 1996 to improve the quality, Aditya added.

 Tourism foray

 The BM Khaitan group has decided to develop the unused low-lying lands in its tea gardens for tourism and biotechnology.

 The groups tea estate is spread over 35,000 hectares. Of this, 70 per cent is used for tea cultivation.

 We have started a small tourism pilot project at Tezpore near the Assam Valley School. We are setting up lodges, which can be used for tourism. The famous Kaziranga forest is a one-hour drive from the spot, said Aditya.

 We strongly feel that the low-lying lands in our tea estates should be gainfully used to increase our cash flows. We are also weighing the option to enter the biotechnology sector. A study is being carried out by some south Indian institutes on biotechnology for us, he added.

 Court lifeline for Escorts hospital

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 7: Delhi High Court today restrained the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) from taking physical possession of Escorts hospital and its premises.

 The order came a day after the DDA cancelled the land lease rights of Escorts Heart Institute and Research Centre (EHIRC). 

 The order was passed by Justice Anil Kumar on a petition filed by EHIRC. The court has asked the DDA to file a reply within two weeks.

 The matter has been posted for further hearing on November 21.

 Fortis Healthcare, which acquired EHIRC for Rs 585 crore, had moved the court against the cancellation of the lease agreement.

 In its notice served to EHIRC on Thursday, the DDA had said, in view of violations, the competent authority has decided to determine the lease deeds of the EHIRC. Accordingly, you are directed to peacefully yield up the said land and building thereon to the lessor ? DDA.

 Last week, Escorts had announced a deal to sell its 90 per cent stake in EHIRC to Fortis Healthcare Ltd, a company owned by promoters of Ranbaxy. Cardiac surgeon Naresh Trehan holds a 10 per cent stake in EHIRC.

 However, the deal was challenged by Anil Nanda, younger brother of Escorts chairman Rajan Nanda.

 The high court has ordered a status quo on the matter.

 Anil, who feels that the charitable trust has been illegally converted into a company, had also written to the ministry of company affairs seeking a probe into the sale.

 According to the DDA, the allotment letter stipulates that EHIRC shall serve as a general public hospital with at least 25 per cent beds reserved for free treatment for the weaker section of the society.

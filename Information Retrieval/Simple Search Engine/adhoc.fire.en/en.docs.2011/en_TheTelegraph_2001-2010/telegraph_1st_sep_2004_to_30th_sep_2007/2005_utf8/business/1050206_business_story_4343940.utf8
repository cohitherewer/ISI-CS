 US court stubs out tobacco case

 Rising from the ashes 

 Washington, Feb. 5 (Reuters): A US appeals court has rejected the government?s bid to force cigarette makers to pay $280 billion in past profits, striking down the toughest sanction from the racketeering case and lifting tobacco stocks.

 The three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled 2-1 that federal law does not allow the monetary ?disgorgement? penalty the government sought in the civil case that has been tried since September.

 ?We hold that the language of (the racketeering law) and the comprehensive remedial scheme of (the racketeering law) preclude disgorgement as a possible remedy in this case,? appeals court judge David Sentelle wrote in the majority opinion.

 Tobacco stocks rose after the ruling, with the S amp;P Tobacco Index closing up 4.92 per cent.

 The decision reverses a lower court ruling in last May and strips the government of its most powerful weapon in the case. Analysts believe it could prompt the government to seek a settlement.

 RJ Reynolds general counsel Charles Blixt said in a statement the ruling ?dramatically transforms the DOJ suit.?

 In addition to the monetary penalty, the government is seeking to impose tougher rules on marketing, advertising and warnings on tobacco products.

 Targeted in the government?s lawsuit, filed in 1999, are Altria Group Inc. and its Philip Morris USA unit; Loews Corp.s Lorillard Tobacco unit, which has a tracking stock, Carolina Group; Vector Group Ltd.s Liggett Group; Reynolds American Inc.s R.J.. Reynolds Tobacco unit and British American Tobacco Plc unit British American Tobacco Investments Ltd.

 Shares of Altria Group closed up $3.26, or 5.11 percent, at $67.00, on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. The stock reached as high as $68.50, its highest level in at least 10 years, after the ruling.

 Reynolds American shares closed up $3.69, or 4.5 per cent, at $85.60, Carolina Group finished up $1.52 at $33.50. Loews shares rose $1.80 to $70.80. Vector shares were up 47 cents at $16.53.

 ?We believe today?s ruling substantially reduces the risk associated with the DOJ lawsuit, and should alleviate investor concerns about that case,? Rob Campagnino, an analyst at Prudential Equity Group, said in a research note.

 Anti-smoking groups urged the government to fight on.

 William Corr, executive director of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said the judge presiding over the trial can still order changes that would further protect the public and require the industry to pay billions of dollars to fund tobacco prevention and cessation programs.

 ?The tobacco industry and its allies may view the ruling as an opportunity to seek a weak settlement of the case. The White House and the Department of Justice should resist such efforts and aggressively pursue the case.?

 A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said its attorneys were reviewing the ruling and had no further comment. 

 The government said cigarette makers deceived the public about the dangers of smoking as part of a 50-year industry conspiracy.

 The tobacco companies deny they illegally conspired to promote smoking and say the government has no grounds to pursue them after they drastically overhauled marketing practices as part of the 1998 settlement with state attorneys general.

 Judge Sentelle, a Ronald Reagan appointee from the tobacco-producing state of North Carolina, wrote that the civil racketeering statute used to bring the case was aimed at putting an end to the illegal conduct going forward.

 ?Disgorgement is a very different type of remedy aimed at separating the criminal from his prior ill- gotten gains and thus may not be properly inferred from (the statute),? Sentelle said.

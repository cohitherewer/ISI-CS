 Mumbai, April 10: In line with its plans to make India a strategic centre for global initiatives, UBICS, the IT services division of the UB Group, is now focusing on making the country contribute at least half of its global revenues. The plan entails emphasis on three SBUs ? IT products, services and solutions.

 UBICS, which is now building a sales and marketing team to support its India operations, will venture into new cities to promote its two IT products and other services. It has also decided to opt for a domain-specific business process outsourcing (BPO) model instead of setting up call centres, which the company feels is at the low-end of the value chain.

 This, combined with a focus on high-end consulting, will help India contribute more than 50 per cent of UBICS? revenues over the next four years. At present, close to 98 per cent of the company?s revenues comes from the US. UBICS now has 300 employees and $24 million in revenues.

 Speaking to The Telegraph, Sunil J. Patil, president of global solutions, said half of the company?s revenues is expected to flow from India over the next four years.

 UBICS recently announced its plans to make India a strategic centre for global customers. With investments of $1 million on research and development (R amp;D) in the current year, the Pittsburgh-based company plans to make the country a major R amp;D hub. The company is setting up state-of-art development centres in Pune, Bangalore and Delhi. The employee strength is expected to jump from 50 to 300 by the end of this year.

 Most of the domestic IT companies are focussing on services, while UBICS is upbeat about two of its IT products, which Patil says will be further indigenised to suit the conditions here. These two products include Ventive, a recruitment and resourcing automation product built under an agreement with Microsoft. Ventive facilitates talent acquisition, development and management. 

 The second product is SeeItFirst, which is a patented interactive streaming video technology that helps organisations deploy video in employee communications, remote training and education, both on archived form and real time.

 Patil said the company has achieved success for two of its products with KPIT Cummins, its customer for Ventive, and State Bank of India (SBI) selecting its second product for employee communication and training across all its centres in the country. UBICS will now focus on sales and marketing of this product.

 Ministry in a spot over LPG quotas

 S. P. S. PANNU

 Asking for more 

 New Delhi, April 19: The petroleum ministry is in a quandary as states are mounting pressure for higher allocations of kerosene and LPG. This entails a huge outgo as subsidy for the public sector oil companies due to skyrocketing international crude prices. 

 The petroleum ministry had raised the quarterly allocation of kerosene by 10 per cent during winter as the states demanded an increased supply of the fuel due to the severe cold. The increased amount was sanctioned on an ad hoc basis after which the oil companies reverted back to the original quotas. 

 However, the states now want this increased amount to continue on a permanent basis. 

 Madhya Pradesh chief minister Babu Lal Gaur met petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today to drive home this point. Aiyar has assured him that he will look into the matter. 

 He added that the National Council of Applied Economic Research will carry out a study to assess the exact demand for kerosene and LPG. The new allocations will take the study into account. 

 Gaur also sought an increased allocation of LPG for tribal areas, where fuel is scarce as the cutting of forests is prohibited. Similar demands have also arisen from the hilly states in the past. 

 Aiyar said the public sector oil companies were working on a proposal to set up community-based LPG kitchens in tribal clusters. 

 However, any increase in the supply of kerosene and LPG will only drain the public sector oil companies, which are already reeling under soaring crude prices. 

 The companies lose over Rs 8 per litre on kerosene supplied through the public distribution system and around Rs 130 per cylinder on LPG sold for domestic use. 

 In addition, they have also been asked to hold the price of diesel and petrol, as a result of which they are not getting the market price for the two transport fuels. 

 The diversion of kerosene for adulteration of diesel is another area of concern for the government and the oil firms. Unscrupulous elements take advantage of the vast cost difference between kerosene and diesel to rake in a fast buck. 

 Similarly, subsidised LPG is also being diverted to run vehicles illegally. LPG cylinders pose a danger when used for fuelling vehicles as they can blow up any time.

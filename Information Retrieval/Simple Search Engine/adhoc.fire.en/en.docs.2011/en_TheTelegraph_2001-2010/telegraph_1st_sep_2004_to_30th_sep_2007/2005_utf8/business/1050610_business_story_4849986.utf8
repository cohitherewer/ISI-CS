 Swift takes price war to launch pad

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 9: There?s been a Swift change of fortunes in the auto industry in recent times. 

 The sudden popularity of Maruti?s Swift has left carmakers wondering if they will all have to cut prices to stay in the race. Hyundai cut its Santro Xing price by Rs 19,000 yesterday. 

 More cars are slated to be launched this fiscal. General Motors plans to re-launch Daewoo?s Matiz in a re-tooled avatar as the small-car Spark. 

 The launch is likely to challenge conventional pricing of entry-level cars like the Alto and Zen in a big way and could force a fresh bout of price wars in the auto market. 

 Sources said Maruti could cut prices of the Alto and Zen by this month-end or in July as its position under threat from GMs plans. Moreover, Hyundai?s aggressive pricing strategies, which saw the Korean car-maker launch a non-AC Santro variant at Rs 2.79 lakh, are a challenge too. 

 Ford wants to introduce a family coupe being developed in Australia which could be priced to beat competitors like the Honda City and the Chevrolet Optra. 

 Sources say the base model could be priced in a way that makes it more attractive than its competitors by offering ?more value for money?.

 ?Launches usher in fresh waves of competition and this will bring down prices, even though vehicle makers here have been affected by the rising cost of raw materials such as steel, plastics, aluminium and rubber,? said S. Lahiri, an auto-market analyst.

 Ford?s moves could see Honda and Chevrolet reacting in a manner similar to the Hyundai-Maruti price jousting. 

 Volkswagen also plans to bring in a small car based on the Volkswagen Fox within the next year. ?This too will impact the price of entry level cars,? said Lahiri.

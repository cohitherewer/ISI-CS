 Mumbai, May 24: The government will work to contain inflation and keep interest rates benign, finance minister P. Chidambaram said at the annual general meeting of the Bombay Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI) today.

 However, he cautioned that oil prices and money supply could put pressure on inflation, which would push up interest rates.

 The government will borrow less than estimates this fiscal, he added. While the cash flow has been better properly, the new year has begun with good cash reserves, the finance minister said. 

 We will do our best to keep inflation under control and interest rates benign to promote investment, he said.

 Chidambaram pointed out that if inflation is low, borrowings are less and interest rate benign, the economy will grow at the same rate as last year. This could lead to better credit offtake from the corporate sector.

 However, he admitted that there were pressures on the inflation front because of huge money supply and spiralling global crude oil prices. At the same time, there were pressures on interest rates due to government borrowing and demand for money from industries.

 While a large inflow of foreign exchange contributed to money supply growth, Chidambaram said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has absorbed Rs 23,900 crore from the reverse repo auction, indicating huge money supply and liquidity in the system.

 Chidambaram showed his displeasure at the manufacturing sector for raising prices at the slightest pretext, which he felt could damage the economy. Such price hikes lead to a rise in the inflation rate and a consequent increase in interest rates, he added.

 Interest rates are inextricably linked to inflation. When interest rates go up, the immediate impact is on investments, which are postponed, he said.

 Therefore, the industry needs to improve corporate governance and ethics and keep prices low by controlling costs, using new technology and avoiding wasteful expenditure. This, he added, is key to orderly development of the country.

 Regarding growth of non-food credit, the finance minister is optimistic that demand for credit during the current fiscal will be as good as last year. He also stressed on a sustained growth for the next 10-15 years and re-investment of the corporate sector earnings.

 The finance minister said the Indian corporate sector is not the highest taxed. While it has been his endeavour to keep the rates moderate, Chidambaram asked the BCCI to set up two units for large tax payers and small tax payers to facilitate better compliance.

 He asked the industry to work with the state government to improve the infrastructure of Mumbai so that it could emerge as a financial hub.

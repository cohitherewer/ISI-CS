 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Bindra: Action time

 Mumbai, Jan. 13: Standard Chartered Bank today announced the formation of a new south Asia region comprising India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

 Jaspal Bindra, the bank?s global chief of client relationships in wholesale banking, will head the expanded south-Asia region.

 Under the new governance model, the CEOs of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Afghanistan will report to Bindra who will in turn report to Kai Nargolwala, group executive director and chairman of wholesale banking. He is also the head of governance for Asia. Bindra will be based in Mumbai, said a bank official. 

 Prior to the formation of this new region, India and Nepal formed part of one segment, while Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh were part of Middle East and South Africa.

 Standard Chartered Bank said there will not be any material change in the day-to-day businesses in these countries.

 Explaining the reasons for the change, the bank said the dynamic economies of the region provides excellent opportunities for growth.

 As the largest international bank in each of these markets, Standard Chartered Bank feels that it is well set to capture a large share of trade in these regions.

 ?The grouping of these countries in South Asia into one region reflects not only the geographic proximity of the markets, but underline the shared culture and business synergies that they have with each other,? the bank added.

 Prior to moving to Singapore, Bindra was chief executive of the India region for the bank and responsible for its successful integration with the Grindlays business in India and Nepal.

 Commenting on the appointment of Bindra, Nargolwala said the move reinforces the bank?s commitment to the region and its determination to expand here.

 ?Jaspal?s strategic leadership has been instrumental in growing many businesses across Standard Chartered in several countries, including India, in the past and more recently the wholesale global client franchise of the bank,? he added.

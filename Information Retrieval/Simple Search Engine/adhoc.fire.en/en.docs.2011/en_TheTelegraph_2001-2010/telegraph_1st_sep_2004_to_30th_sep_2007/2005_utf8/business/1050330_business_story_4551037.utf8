 Calcutta, March 29: Fidelity Investments is keen on strengthening ties with retail investors and has structured its first equity fund accordingly.

 ?It is the first equity fund to offer systematic investment plan (SIP) during the initial public offering. It has been done to increase retail participation,? Fidelity Investments head of business Ashu Suyash said.

 ?Also, the load structure of the fund has been designed to attract long-term money and dissuade active traders, since the latter harms the interests of long-term players,? said Suyash.

 For lumpsum investments, the entry load will be charged at 2.25 per cent for an amount below Rs 5 crore. There will be no entry load for an amount equal to and more than Rs 5 crore. However, for such investments, there will be an exit load of 1 per cent if the amount is withdrawn within six months.

 For SIP, where a single instalment is less than or equal to Rs 1 lakh and where it is equal to or more than Rs 5 crore, there is no entry load. For instalments between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 5 crore, there is an entry load of 2.25 per cent. However, there will be an exit load of 2 per cent for redemptions made from SIP within two years and provided there was no entry load.

 ?It is our bigger focus to rake in retail assets into the fund. Globally, more than 55-60 per cent of our total assets is constituted by retail business,? said Suyash. 

 The entry load charged during the offer period will be used to cover initial issue expenses, while any excess will be borne by the fund house. 

 ?We believe that it is against the principle to charge the issue expenses to the investors. Thus, no extra expenses shall be charged to the fund and the entry load will be retained by distributors,? said Suyash.

 According to the existing guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the asset management company can charge initial issue expenses up to 6 per cent to the fund. While many fund houses do not charge entry load during the initial offer period of their funds, they do charge initial issue expenses to the fund, which at the maximum rate of 6 per cent translates into a much higher amount.

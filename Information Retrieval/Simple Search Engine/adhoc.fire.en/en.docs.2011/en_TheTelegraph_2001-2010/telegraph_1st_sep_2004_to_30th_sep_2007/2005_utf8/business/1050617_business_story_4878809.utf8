 Reliance scrip rules firm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 16: The Reliance scrip hogged the limelight today as news of a unique settlement formula, which will be equitable to non-promoter shareholders of the company, did the rounds. 

 The new formula hinges on a demerger of equity stakes of Reliance Energy, Reliance Infocomm and Reliance Capital to a special purpose vehicle that will have a similar share owning structure as Reliance Industries. However, Reliance officials did not confirm this settlement formula. 

 RIL holds 43 per cent in Reliance Energy, 47 per cent in Reliance Capital and a little less than 45 per cent in Reliance Infocomm.

 On BSE, Reliance opened firm at 582.25 and rallied to a high of Rs 591.35, before closing at 590.80, showing a gain of Rs 15.85 or 2.76 per cent over yesterdays close of Rs 574.95.

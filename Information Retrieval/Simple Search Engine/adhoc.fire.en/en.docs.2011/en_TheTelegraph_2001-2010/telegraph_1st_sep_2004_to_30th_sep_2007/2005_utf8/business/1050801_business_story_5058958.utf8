 Bull-run bounty for top brass

 (Top) Murthy and 

 Chowdhry: On a selling spree 

 Mumbai, July 31: The promoters and top brass of India Inc are cashing in on the bull run on the bourses, selling part of their share holdings as stock market barometers soar to lifetime peaks.

 In many companies like Adani Exports, Matrix Laboratories and M amp;M, the promoter holdings have slipped by a few percentage points. This was either because portions of their shares were sold or due to fresh FCCB issues that reduced their holdings.

 It is always prudent for investors to book partial profits every time markets go up, says a strategist affiliated to a leading portfolio advisory firm.

 Unlike the bull runs of 2000 and before, this time the insiders are reporting every transaction to the stock exchanges.

 Sunil Mittal of Bharti Tele-Ventures sold his personal stake of 27.5 lakh shares in his flagship company to rake in around Rs 60 crore.

 In May, when Infosys Technologies announced the second series of American depository shares, chairman and chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy and his top management team, including CEO Nandan Nilekani and COO S. Gopalakrishnan, offloaded part of their holdings that netted Rs 1500 crore.

 Murthy himself sold over 1.55 million shares, including 1.9 lakh optional shares, lowering his stake to around 6.01 per cent from about 6.58 per cent. He has garnered close to Rs 435 crore.

 In Gujarat Ambuja Cement, board member A.L. Kapur sold 7500 shares on June 21 and June 22. His stake is now 0.02 per cent of the companys share capital. His colleague, Anil Singhvi, sold 15,000 shares on June 27 to lower his stake to 0.054 per cent. Both had also sold part of their holdings in May and in early June, albeit in small lots.

 Associated Cement Company saw managing director M. L. Narula selling 9,000 shares on July 15 and 2,500 on July 18. Narula now owns 45,455 ACC shares 56,955 earlier.

 S.K. Agarwal of Transport Corporation of India sold 2894 shares of the firm in the open market on July 18. He now holds 25,004 shares.

 HCL Technologies saw director Ajai Chowdhry selling 1,00,000 shares of the company. Whole-time director S. Raman also sold 20,000 shares of the company.

 Senior executives of Nicholas Piramal and Lupin Laboratories have also booked profits partially. 

 Promoters of small companies like Surana Telecom Ltd have also sold portion of their holdings in the open market.

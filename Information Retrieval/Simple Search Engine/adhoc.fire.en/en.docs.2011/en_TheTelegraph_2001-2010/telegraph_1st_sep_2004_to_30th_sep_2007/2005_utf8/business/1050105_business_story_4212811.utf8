 Calcutta, Jan. 4: The Indian Semiconductor Association (ISA) will appoint a market research agency within the next three months to conduct a study of the domestic semiconductor industry, which is currently valued between $400 and $500 million and consists of 70 to 80 companies. Globally, the semiconductor industry is valued at $240 billion.

 Speaking on the sidelines of the VLSI (very large scale integration) seminar held in the city, Pradip Dutta, president and managing director of Synopsys India, said, ?We are in the process of finalising a partner for the research. The semiconductor industry, though a decade old in India, has been fragmented and there are no statistics available on the amount of investments and the growth that the segment has seen.?

 The ISA is also working in collaboration with the Nasscom, the apex body for software services, to draw a strategy that will help create a complete ecosystem for the semiconductor industry.

 ?The design industry itself is expected to grow up to $800 million in India. We want to be present in all aspects of the chip industry, from concept, designing, testing, packaging to manufacturing,? said Rajendra Khare, managing director of Broadcom India and chairman of the ISA.

 The association feels that the study will help members drive growth by focussing on areas like marketing and push for consumption in sectors like automotive industry, consumer electronics and mobile phones.

 Another area of focus will be attracting investments from venture capitalists. ?Last year, the US attracted investments of around $10 billion, while fund flow to India stood at a mere $60 million. Besides investments from multinationals, it is also necessary to create a strong domestic market,? Khare said.

 The ISA is also working on a platform for interaction between the industry and academia. While major institutes like IIIT-Bangalore, BITS Pilani and IIT-Kharagpur have already evinced interest in joining the forum, the apex body expects 20 to 25 universities and institutes to join.

 ?We are working in collaboration with professors and the industry to arrive at a curriculum that will benefit students and allow them to work on live projects,? said Satya Gupta, VP-engineering, Open Silicon.

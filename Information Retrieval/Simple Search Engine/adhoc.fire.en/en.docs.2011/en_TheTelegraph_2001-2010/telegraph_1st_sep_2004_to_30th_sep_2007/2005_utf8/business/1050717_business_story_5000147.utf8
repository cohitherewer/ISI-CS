 Calcutta, July 16: Mahindra amp; Mahindra is gearing up to take competition from rivals like Tata Motors head on. The company, which currently manufactures only light commercial vehicles, plans to roll out medium and heavy commercial vehicles by 2008. 

 As of now, commercial vehicles contribute little to M amp;M?s automobile portfolio. With brands like Scorpio, Armada and Bolero, the company is a market leader in the utility vehicle segment in passenger cars.

 As a precursor to its entry into manufacturing commercial vehicles with higher cargo carrying capacity, M amp;M has recently tied up with International Truck and Engine Corporation of the US and has earmarked an investment of about Rs 700 crore for the diversification programme. A company official said the research and development (R amp;D) work for the project has already been undertaken. ?We want to attain 90 per cent indigenous status in the MCV and HCV portfolio,? he added.

 At present, M amp;M manufactures its LCVs at its Zaheerabad facility in Andhra Pradesh. For medium and heavy commercial vehicles, the company is considering setting up a new factory. M amp;M currently makes mini trucks, in the brand name of Loadking, in the carrying capacity range of 3.5-6 tonnes. The company is also readying a modified variant of Loadking that can carry upto 7.5 tonnes. 

 The company also sells passenger coaches (bus) under the brand name of Tourister. 

 M amp;M?s commercial vehicles sales stood at 7,800 units at the end of March 2005, which it expects to grow to 12,000 units during the current fiscal. To achieve this, the company is putting special thrusts to its mini truck division which is expected to engine the sales growth. 

 The company has already come up with an upgraded version of its LCV Loadking Pride and few more launches are expected during the remaining months of the year as it hopes to sale 7,000 mini trucks against 3,700 units last year.

 Analysts pointed out that M amp;M?s entry into MCV and HCV was well timed given the rapid growth expected from the infrastructure sector. ?As more and more international standard highways come into existence, the market will move towards higher tonnage vehicle,? they said.

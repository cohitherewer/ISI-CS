 Relief for twin offers

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Nov. 17: The government has waived the requirement for revised pricing guidelines in the case of companies that come out with a simultaneous offer of foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) and ordinary shares on the domestic or overseas markets.

 Companies that go in for simultaneous or immediate follow-on offerings on overseas markets (i.e. within 30 days of the domestic float) will have to seek the approval of the Securities and Exchange Board of India for such an issue, which must specify the percentage to be offered on the domestic and ADR/GDR markets.

 The waiver came in response to the representations received from industry after the August 31 amendment to the Issue of Foreign Currency Convertible Bonds and Ordinary Shares (Through Depository Receipt Mechanism) Scheme, 1993, said a press note issued today.

 The note also clarified that unlisted companies, which have already issued GDRs or FCCBs on the international market, and have yet to list on the domestic market, would be required to do so by March 31, 2006.

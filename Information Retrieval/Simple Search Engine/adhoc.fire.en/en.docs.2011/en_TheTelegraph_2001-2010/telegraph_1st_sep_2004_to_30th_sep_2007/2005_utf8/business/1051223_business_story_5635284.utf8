 Calcutta, Dec. 22: The year 2006 promises to be one of the best for the domestic tea industry in recent times, leaving behind years of downturn that saw stagnant consumption and depleting margins for tea companies.

 All indicators are pointing towards a healthy start for the industry next year, predicted the Indian Tea Association (ITA), the body of leading tea growers in the country.

 There are lower arrivals in the auction centres, lower stocks at these centres and lower outlots. All these indicate that 2006 should be a good year, ITA chairman P.T. Siganporia said.

 In the last few years, the industry has been plagued with workers unrest with many gardens closing down as planters lost interest in the business.

 But the situation seems to be turning for the better, feels the ITA.

 There is hardly any stock in the system unlike last year when stocks were carried forward from the previous year. As a consequence, prices should firm up, said Aditya Khaitan, vice-chairman of ITA and managing director of McLeod Russel.

 Per capita consumption of tea in the country has grown from 716 grams in 2004 to 733.1 grams in 2005. Seen from a 10-year perspective, consumption has grown from 642.5 grams in 1997. 

 We are seeing light at the end of the tunnel. More people are relishing this beverage, Siganporia, who is also managing director of Tata Tea, said. 

 An ITA study on the domestic tea scenario said the Indian crop in 2005 would be higher by 54 million kg to touch 920 million kg.

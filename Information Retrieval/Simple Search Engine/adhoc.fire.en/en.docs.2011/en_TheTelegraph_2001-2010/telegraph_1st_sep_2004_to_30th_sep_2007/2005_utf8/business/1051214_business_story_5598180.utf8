 Hiring on a high in the east

 Jobs in a row

 New Delhi, Dec. 13: Those who are impatient to shift base from the east and try out greener pastures in the southern or western parts of the country, think twice. 

 A survey conducted by recruitment consulting firm Manpower reveals that employers in the eastern region will hire the most after those in the north, followed by the south and west. 

 ?The employment picture in all four regions is very positive. The north and east are the most optimistic, with the net employment outlook (the percentage of employers anticipating an increase in hiring minus the percentage of employers expecting a fall) of 32 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively,? the survey says.

 On a quarter-on-quarter basis there is a 2 per cent decline in the proportion of employers who anticipate a decrease in the size of the workforce in the east.

 The survey adds that though companies in India will continue to add more personnel to their existing workforce, the pace of hiring may come down in the first three months of the new year as compared with the October-December 2005 period.

 The overall picture, however, remains positive with the survey forecasting ?positive hiring intentions? by employers, which means companies will continue to hire people, perhaps a little less when compared with the October?December 2005 period.

 ?With experts backing India?s sustained labour market growth, there is a pressing need for employers to quickly and critically examine their recruitment and retention strategies to make them more effective in future. The shortage of skills is expected to get worse,? said Tarun Bali, executive director of Manpower.

 Bali said hiring intentions are cautious when compared with the previous quarter, but are still strong. ?This quarter we see a higher proportion of employers who are unsure of their hiring plans for the next quarter. This is true of companies that spend the January-March quarter closing orders and reviewing performance,? he said.

 ?Positive hiring intentions are expected across all sectors in the upcoming quarter with employers in the finance, insurance and real estate sector reporting the most optimistic trend,? the survey said.

 United Air inks labour deal with mechanics

 Staying afloat 

 New York, May 17 (Reuters): UAL Corp, parent of bankrupt United Airlines, said on Monday it has reached a tentative labour agreement with the union representing its mechanics.

 The number two US airline is restructuring in an attempt to wring $725 million annually from its labour force to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection by the end of the year.

 This agreement consensually achieves the cost savings United needs, while addressing AMFAs concerns over pay, job security, benefits, and work rules, United said in a statement.

 The deal must be ratified by the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association membership for it to be valid. 

 United Airlines is still in labour negotiations with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.

 United Air went to trial last week to seek permission to void collective bargaining deals with the two unions in a drive to win cost savings.

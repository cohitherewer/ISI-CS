 Subsidy burden hurts Indian Oil

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ramachandran: Hopeful

 New Delhi, Jan. 31: The burgeoning LPG and kerosene subsidy burden has pulled down the net profit of Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) to Rs 1,287 crore during the third quarter of the current financial year from Rs 2,404 in the year-ago period, a decline of 46.5 per cent.

 IOC chairman M. S. Ramachandran said the company lost Rs 2,124 crore during the quarter as part of its share of the LPG and kerosene subsidy burden. IOC was also forced to accept lower margins on diesel and petrol sales during the current fiscal in order to maintain prices at reasonable levels despite soaring international prices. ?Under-recoveries? on this account work out to Rs 951 crore till January 31. 

 On the positive side, the refinery margins of the company went up to $5.4 per barrel in the third quarter from $4.6 per barrel in the same quarter last year. The larger refining capacity helped it to check its profit erosion compared to Hindustan Petroleum, for instance, which saw a 70 per cent decline in its net profit during the third quarter.

 Ramachandran said the average price of the Indian basket of crude imports worked out to $39.67 per barrel during the third quarter.

 He said with international crude prices settling at lower levels in recent weeks, IOC would hopefully make higher profits during the last quarter of the current fiscal. The IOC chief expects the average price of the Indian basket of crude to work out to around $35 per barrel for the current fiscal.

 Net profit of IOC for the nine months ended December 2004 is Rs 3,999 crore compared with RS 5,155 crore for the same period of the previous year.

 Product sales of the company, including exports, rose by over 4 per cent to 37.12 million tonnes compared with 35.57 million tonnes during the same period of the previous year. Its refinery throughput was also higher by 1.28 per cent at 27.61 million tonnes compared to 27.26 million tonnes during the corresponding period last year.

 Libyan oil block

 Indian Oil and Oil India have succeeded in bagging an oil exploration block in Libya. This will be the first major international foray being spearheaded by OIL.

 Block number 86 awarded to the IOC-OIL consortium is located in the Sirta region of Libya. IOC and OIL had jointly bid for four of these blocks and had managed to win one of them. 

 ONGC already has a stake in two blocks in Libya. Together with the IOC-OIL combine, India now has three exploration blocks to test its expertise and luck in what is seen as a potentially oil-rich territory.

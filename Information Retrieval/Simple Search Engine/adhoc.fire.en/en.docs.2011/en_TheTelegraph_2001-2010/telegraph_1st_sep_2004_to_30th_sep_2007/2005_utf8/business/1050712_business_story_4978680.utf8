 Sensex touches Monday milestone

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 11: The sensex today soared past the 7300-mark for the first time, boosted by frantic buying by foreign funds following a sharp rise in global stock prices and a fall in crude rates. 

 The BSE bellwether index opened higher at 7227.51 and rose steeply to 7320.25 before closing at 7306.74, registering a 1.31 per cent increase over its previous close of 7212.08. Since the January 3 close of 6679.20, the sensex has risen close to 10 per cent till now.

 The key overseas indices also showed a strong growth. While the Nikkei shot up 108.80 points, the Hang Seng rose by 192.77 points and the Singapore ST index by 25.20 points.

 In London, the FTSE-100 index hit a three-year high at its opening. The Dow Jones industrial average rallied by 146.85 points and the Nasdaq composite index by 37.22 points.

 Brokers feel the rise was further fuelled by the fall in global crude prices to below $59 per barrel. 

 The confidence level in the market continues to remain high. The bourses are optimistic about the first-quarter results of India Inc and feels that Infosys and other IT companies will not disappoint, a portfolio manager said.

 Though the Bangalore-based Infosys will announce its results tomorrow, the first set of quarterly earnings from Bajaj Hindusthan Ltd and IndiaBulls were above market expectations.

 On the Bombay Stock Exchange today, where buying was seen largely across the board, heavyweights such as Reliance Industries and ICICI Bank ended with strong gains. 

 The sectoral indices, barring the IT index, which was down by 3.56 points following moderate decline in Infosys and Wipro stocks, recorded moderate to sharp gains. 

 The Bankex led the pack by gaining 111.34 points to close at 4259.95. On the other hand, the BSE-Auto index rose 60.48 points or 2.05 per cent to 3007.96, the BSE-Smallcap by 82.05 points or 1.78 per cent to 4683.55, the BSE-Midcap by 50.29 points or 1.44 per cent to 3536.64 and the BSE-Metal rose 62.70 points or 1.12 per cent to 5676.82.

 On the National Stock Exchange, the nifty opened marginally lower at 2195.55 against the previous close of 2196.20. 

 Heavy buying saw it rise to an intra-day high of 2224.65 before closing at 2218.85, a gain of 1.03 per cent over the previous close.

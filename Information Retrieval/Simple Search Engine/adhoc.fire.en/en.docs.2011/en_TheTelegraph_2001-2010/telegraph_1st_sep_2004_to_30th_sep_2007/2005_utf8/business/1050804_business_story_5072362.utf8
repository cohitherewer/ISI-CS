 Mukesh fails to match market expectations

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 3: Mukesh Ambani disappointed Reliance investors, who were looking forward to an announcement on big-ticket overseas acquisition, more details on the demerger plan and a bonus issue at the annual general meeting today.

 The disappointment was reflected in the RIL share, which plunged sharply from its intra-day peak reached ahead of Ambanis address to shareholders. The impact was also felt on the sensex, which retraced from the 7800-mark attained in the early hours of trading. 

 The Reliance scrip, which has the biggest weight in the sensex, had played a major role in pushing the bellwether index to new highs in recent times. This was triggered by expectations that investors will get a large number of shares of Reliance Capital, Reliance Energy and the telecom business.

 In the run-up to the annual general meeting, the market was agog with rumours that the Reliance chairman will make an announcement on a big overseas acquisition or clear the air on the proposed demerger plan.

 However, these hopes died young as the senior Ambani neither divulged the details of the demerger nor announced an acquisition.

 The RIL shares had rallied for the past two weeks on hopes of major announcements at the meeting. Therefore, the expectation was high and Ambani clearly disappointed the markets, said a portfolio manager at a leading brokerage.

 Mirroring the disappointment, shares of RIL, which opened at Rs 741 and hit a high of Rs 760, plummeted to a low of Rs 710 and closed at Rs 713.70 ? an intra-day fall of Rs 46.30. Its close marked a drop of Rs 28 over the last finish. The RIL scrip was the top-traded one on the BSE with 136.32 lakh shares changing hands, resulting in a turnover of Rs 1,002.21 crore.

 The sensex also seemed to follow RILs movement. After opening at 7774.29, it breached the 7800-mark for the first time to touch an intra-trade high of 7843.77.

 However, a selling pressure in Reliance group stocks saw the index ending the day at 7756.47 against yesterdays close of 7756.04, a net gain of 0.43 points.

 Market analysts are not ruling out the possibility of a sharp correction in the immediate term. The RIL annual general meeting came and went and it did not contain any major positive surprises. We may be in for a correction, a broker said.

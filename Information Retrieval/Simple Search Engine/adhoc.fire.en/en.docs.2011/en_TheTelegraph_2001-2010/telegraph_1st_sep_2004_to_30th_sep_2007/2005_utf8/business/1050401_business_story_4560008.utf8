 New Delhi, March 31: The Indian Airlines board today approved an initial public offering of 10 per cent in the state- run airline. 

 The board also cleared a controversial move to hive off its ground handling division into a joint venture with Singapore Airport Terminal Services.

 The decision on the fresh equity offering, which has to be ratified by the government, comes on the heels of a cabinet decision to inject Rs 325 crore equity into the airline. IA currently has a paid-up equity of about Rs 107 crore. 

 Officials were unclear whether the IPO would be floated before or after the central government pumped in equity. 

 The extra equity is necessary to better leverage debt the airline needs to buy some 43 new Airbus aircraft at an estimated cost of Rs 9,000 crore.

 The joint venture cleared today will look after ground handling comprising passengers, cargo, ramp and security services at various airports in India.

 Officials said the details of the joint venture, including equity pattern, are yet to be worked out and the JV would be subject to a final approval by the government.

 ?This joint venture seeks to enhance the third party ground handling revenues in addition to providing high quality self handling for Indian Airlines,? officials said. 

 The board also agreed to lease 10 more A-320 aircraft for this years winter schedule. IA is looking at expanding operations in both the domestic and international markets, officials said. 

 The domestic air traffic market has grown over the last one year by around 25 per cent, while international traffic has grown 18 per cent.

 The airline?s board has approved the revised revenue and expenditure estimates for 2004-05 and budget estimates for 2005-06. 

 Revised estimates for 2004-05 show a net profit of Rs 17.50 crore. This will be the second successive year when the state-run carrier will be reporting a net profit after suffering losses for three years between 2000-01 and 2002-03. 

 The budget estimates for 2005-06 indicate a net profit of Rs 10.75 crore. The budget estimates have been kept on the lower side taking into account a possible increase in ATF prices and higher costs of leasing new aircraft.

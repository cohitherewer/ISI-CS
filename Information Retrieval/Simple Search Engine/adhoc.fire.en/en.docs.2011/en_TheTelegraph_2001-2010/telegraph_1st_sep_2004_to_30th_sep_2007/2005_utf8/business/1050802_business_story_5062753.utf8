The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Cap on crude prices hits IBP hard

 S.P.S PANNU 

 Difficult times ahead

 New Delhi, Aug. 1: IBP, the downstream oil marketing company, is trapped in the Indian oil sector paradox. While its fuel stations sell more petrol and diesel than those of Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum or Hindustan Petroleum, it will have to be wheeled into the sick bay half-way through the current fiscal due to the price structure.

 Petroleum secretary S.C. Tripathi told The Telegraph that 50 per cent of IBP?s net worth would be eroded by the middle of this fiscal. As a result, the company would become sick. It would then be referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR).

 Since both petrol and diesel are being sold at a loss, the higher sales of these two fuels also translate into increased losses for IBP.

 The company had reported a whopping Rs 234 crore loss during the April to June quarter of the current fiscal. 

 IBP started to suffer losses from last fiscal, as it was forced to sell petrol and diesel at prices lower than the purchase value. But the government had bailed out the company by sanctioning a Rs 80-crore payment due to tit as old arrears from the oil-pool account. This had enabled IBP to scrape through with a small profit.

 However, matters have become worse this year. IBP is on weaker wicket than other oil companies, as it does not own a refinery.

 IOC, BPCL and HPCL can offset part of their losses on petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene sales from the high margins of their refinery divisions by selling products at international prices. IOC, which has the highest refining capacity, is able to cover losses more than HPCL or BPCL.

 As IBP does not own a refinery, it buys petrol and diesel at international prices from other refineries and sells them at domestic prices, which are much lower. 

 IBP?s petrol and diesel sales have been growing at 12 per cent per annum compared with the industry?s 6 per cent sales growth. Its chain of petrol pumps has expanded from 1,800 in 2002 to 3,800 now.

 The IOC board has cleared the proposal of merging IBP with the parent company ? 100 shares of IBP will be converted into 125 IOC shares.

 However, the government has not given its stamp of approval as yet. It has sought a clarification on how the merger will affect the government?s holding in IOC. The government is worried that the high swap ratio may reduce its stake in IOC.

 The share conversion ratio of 1:1.25 has been worked out taking into consideration stock prices of the two companies at the time.

 With the merger of the two companies, IBP?s balance sheet would be clubbed with IOC. Hence, shareholders would get the advantage of the refining margins of IOC. 

 However, now all oil companies have plunged into the red. 

 IOC has reported a loss of Rs 54 crore for the April-June quarter, against a profit of Rs 1,472 crore a year ago. BPCL has suffered a loss of Rs 431.3 crore, while HPCL posted a loss of Rs 507 crore for the first quarter.

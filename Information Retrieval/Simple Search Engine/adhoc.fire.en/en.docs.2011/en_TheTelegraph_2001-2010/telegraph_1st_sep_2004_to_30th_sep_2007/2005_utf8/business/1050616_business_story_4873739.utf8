 Investors say Yes to bank flotation

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 15: Mirroring the success of other initial public offerings in recent times, Yes Banks maiden public issue today opened on a positive note registering an over-subscription of more than 8 times.

 The data available from the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange till late evening revealed that it generated a cumulative bid quantity of 57.86 crore shares in both the exchanges against an issue size of 7 crore shares. 

 While the QIB portion was oversubscribed more than 16 times, foreign institutional investors (FIIs) and mutual funds led the investors pack as usual. Retail investor interest is only expected to pick up towards the close of the issue.

 The positive investment feedback for the IPO came on a day when markets were brimming with confidence ignoring the apprehensions about a delayed monsoon. The key index finished on a three-month peak particularly on FII and mutual fund buying. 

 The public issue will augment Yes Banks capital base. The funds will be utilised to finance its growth plans.

 Of the 7 crore shares on offer, it will allocate up to 50 per cent to qualified institutional buyers, at least 25 per cent to non-institutional bidders and a minimum of 25 per cent to retail investors. While the allotment to qualified institutional bidders would be on a discretionary basis, allotment to non-institutional bidders and retail investors would be on a proportionate basis.

 Yes Bank promoters, Rana Kapoor and Ashok Kapur, together hold a 52.1 per cent stake in the bank before the public issue. 

 The other major pre-IPO shareholders in the bank include Rabobank International of Netherlands holding a 20 per cent stake and three foreign private equity investors ? Citicorp International Finance Corporation (10 per cent), ChrysCapital LLC (7.5 per cent) and AIF Capital (7.5 per cent).

 While the Reserve Bank has already given its nod to Rabobank to maintain its stake at 20 per cent post issue, this stake will be maintained for a period of five years and will be done through open market purchases.

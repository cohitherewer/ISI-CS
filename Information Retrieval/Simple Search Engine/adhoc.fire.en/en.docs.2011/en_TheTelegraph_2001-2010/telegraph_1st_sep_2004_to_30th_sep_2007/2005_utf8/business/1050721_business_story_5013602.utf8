 Biocon first-quarter net drops 20%

 Mazumdar-Shaw: Reality check

 Bangalore, July 20: Biocon Ltd today announced a 20.4 per cent drop in net profit at Rs 39 crore in the April-June quarter compared with Rs 49 crore in the same period last year. The decline in earnings was attributed to price pressures in Europe on its cholesterol-busting Statin drugs.

 Announcing the first-quarter results, chairperson and managing director Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said the companys performance was impacted by capacity constraints and increased depreciation on new facilities. Also, Biocon had incurred higher investments towards research and development. 

 This quarter bore the brunt of capacity constraints, price erosion, depreciation in interest charges and depreciation on account of large expansion.

 The decline in profit after tax can be mainly attributed to higher tax charges during the quarter due to a significant portion of export sales being routed through domestic channels. The reduced treasury income of Rs 2 crore commensurate with the deployment of IPO proceeds in the expansion programme. The company has raised Rs 350 crore through the IPO route in March 2004.

 Shaw was upbeat about the rest of the fiscal. She said insulin and immuno-suppressants would be the new growth engines. Branded formulations are building the bio-pharmaceuticals business in a more robust manner and reducing the dependence on Statins, she added.

 New research contracts for Syngene and Clinigene will add to the companys revenue. The new capacities will come on stream in the second half of this fiscal, she said.

 Biocon has made progress in research related to the treatment of cancer and diabetes. These are likely to open global opportunities in the next two-three years. Therefore, it is important to evaluate Biocons business prospects with a long-term perspective rather than a quarterly review, Shaw said.

 Sequentially, the net profit of the first quarter was down 7 per cent from the fourth quarter of last fiscal. As a result, earnings per share on issued capital declined by 20 per cent to Rs 3.9 from Rs 4.9 per a year ago. The companys revenue reported a flat growth year-on-year. The consolidated income stood at Rs 174 crore in the reporting quarter. It was the same last year.

 The company, however, maintained the 30 per cent margin on sequential basis in terms of EBITDA.

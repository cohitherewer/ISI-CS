 CAG spots leaks in ONGC deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 11: ONGC has lost Rs 74 crore worth of precious natural gas as it chose Bharat Pumps amp; Compressors and Engineering Projects (India) Ltd, two companies that were neck-deep in financial trouble, to execute the contract for tapping the gas.

 This has been highlighted in the latest report of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India on oil companies. 

 Due to the delay in implementing the contract for putting gas compressors in place at the Gandhar field in Gujarat, ONGC was forced to flare the gas in the air between August 2001 and December 2003. 

 Since the pressure of the gas was too low, it could not be supplied to consumers through a pipeline and had to be flared. ONGC decided to install compressors to increase the gas pressure so that it could be sold in the market instead of being wasted through the flaring process. 

 According to the CAG report, ONGC not only took excessive time in placing the work orders but also selected Bharat Pumps amp; Compressors (BPC) and Engineering Projects (EPI) that were facing financial problems right from the beginning.

 Samsung unveils largest LCD

 Seoul, March 7 (AFP): Samsung Electronics claimed today to have developed the world?s largest liquid crystal display panel, challenging the dominance of plasma display panel technology in the large screen TV market.

 At 82-inches, the new liquid crystal display (LCD) unveiled at a Seoul hotel, is 17 inches larger than the previous largest LCD flat panel screen developed by Japan?s Sharp Electronics.

 Samsung said the new screen also features a 180 degree visual access system, allowing viewers to see images even from an angle.

 ?It is an innovative product because it has broken the pre-conception that a TFT-LCD cannot match a plasma display panel or a projection TV screen in enlarging the size due to technical factors,? Samsung said in a statement.

 LCDs are used largely for computer screens and sometimes for large TV sets but plasma screens have dominated the large TV screen market up to now. In December, Samsung had said it had developed a 102-inch plasma flat TV screen, the world?s largest. The development has put the company?s TFT-LCD technology a year ahead of competitors, a Samsung official said.

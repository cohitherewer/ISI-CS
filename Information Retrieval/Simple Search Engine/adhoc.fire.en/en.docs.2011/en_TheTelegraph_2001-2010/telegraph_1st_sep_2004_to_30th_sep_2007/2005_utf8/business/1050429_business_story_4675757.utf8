 Eveready posts Rs 46 cr net profit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 28: Eveready Industries India Limited has registered a net profit of Rs 46.31 crore in 2004-05. The company had suffered a net loss of Rs 38 lakh in 2003-04.

 However, the audited accounts for 2004-05 cannot be compared with that of the previous year as this year?s results reflect the financials of the continuing business of the demerged company, which only manufactures and sells dry cell batteries, flashlights, packet tea and related products.

 The accounts of 2003-04 also include the results of the bulk tea business, which has now been demerged into a new company ? McLeod Russell.

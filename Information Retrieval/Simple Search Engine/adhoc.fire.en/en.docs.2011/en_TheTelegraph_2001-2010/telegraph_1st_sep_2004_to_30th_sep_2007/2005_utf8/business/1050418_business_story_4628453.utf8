The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Plan of action floated for army of healers

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 17: India?s healthcare industry is expected to grow 2.7 times to touch Rs 2,70,000 crore by 2012. At present, it is worth Rs 1,00,000 crore.

 However, policy mandarins will need to tweak regulations and ensure upgradation of infrastructure if they wish to carve out a substantial slice of the $3-trillion global healthcare industry by 2012.

 A recent study conducted by the PHDCCI suggests leveraging the brand of Indian healthcare professionals across the globe.

 ?By doing this, the country would be in a position to grab sizable share of tourists interested in availing affordable and world-class medical facilities in the country,? says the study. 

 The chamber has called for strengthening public private partnership. To attract medical tourists, India will need to invest heavily in building a base of hospitals, preparing medical personnel and making these facilities more cost effective. 

 It is estimated that around $25-30 billion will be needed in the next 10 years to build the facilities required to establish India as a healthcare destination.

 The sector has been growing at a rate of 15 per cent over the past five years.

 According to the study, if medical tourism racks up 25 per cent of revenues of private up-market players by 2012, it will add Rs 10,000 crore to the revenues of major players.

 About 10,000 to 12,000 foreign patients come to India for healthcare services each year.

 ?With a more focused approach to medical tourism, the country has to identify areas like orthopaedics for non-trauma medical disease like replacement or corrective surgery, urology and dental surgery. These are areas where the nation enjoys substantial cost and expertise advantage compared with western countries,? says the study.

 To be formulated under the aegis of the ministry of health, the industry has sought a combined package which needs to be evolved by airlines, travel and tour operators, healthcare providers and insurance agencies. 

 The maximum number of patients coming to India for treatment and vacation visit Kerala. A majority of such tourists come from Gulf countries, Canada and the Maldives.

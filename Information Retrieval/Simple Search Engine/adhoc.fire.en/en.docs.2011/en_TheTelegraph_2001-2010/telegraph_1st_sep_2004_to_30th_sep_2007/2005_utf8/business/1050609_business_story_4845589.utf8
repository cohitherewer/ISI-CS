 Andhra resents RINL merger

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, June 8: Andhra Pradesh has opposed the Union government?s plan to merge Rashtriya Ispat Nigam (RINL) with Steel Authority of India (SAIL). 

 Senior state government officials recently met officials at the Centre and voiced their apprehensions about the fate of RINL, or Vizag Steel as it is called, after its merger with SAIL. 

 However, steel ministry officials said the central government would try to convince the state that the merger would be beneficial for RINL in the long run because of the cyclical nature of steel demand. If Vizag Steel is merged with SAIL, it will have access to the latter?s mineral base, while SAIL will be able to export from Vizag itself.

 ?The next steel price meltdown will again see standalone steel plants going down. Worldwide, only big chains of steel mills have survived the cyclical movements in the industry. The days of pricing controls and duty barriers are over, we are open to the global markets ... we have to plan ahead to keep our steel industry in good shape ahead of the next downswing,? an official said. 

 Global steel prices are known to move in a cyclical fashion every five to seven years. During the last price downswing many standalone steel mills in Europe, the US and other parts of the globe had to either shut shop or sell out. Steel baron L. N. Mitttal had bought out many of the ailing mills for throw-away prices at that time. 

 Ministry officials added that the Centre would explore the possibility of merging other state-run steel units with SAIL. 

 The government wants RINL as well as Indian Iron amp; Steel Company (IISCO) to be merged with SAIL to create a huge steel behemoth, capable of taking on world majors. 

 The new entity, if created, would have a combined crude steel production capacity of 16.2 million tonnes (MT).

 Anil douses buyout rumours

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 11: Anil Ambani today scrambled to douse rumours that he is staking companies in the media, entertainment and banking space.

 At the start of a volatile trading session today that saw the sensex scale new highs, Anil-controlled Reliance Capital denied reports that he was planning to acquire several entertainment companies and a bank in order to emerge as the countrys foremost media mogul. 

 The company has no plans to acquire any of the companies, the notice to the Bombay Stock Exchange said.

 The companies in question were Shyam Ramannas Crest Animation Studio Ltd, RPG groups Saregama Ltd, a leading Bollywood distributors listed company called Shringar Cinema and IndusInd Bank, where the Hindujas control a sizeable stake. 

 Rumours had taken the scrips of these companies to new heights on the bourses. 

 Last month, Anil had charted a new beginning after the settlement of ownership issues within the strife-torn Ambani clan that placed him in control of Reliance Capital, Reliance Energy and Reliance Infocomm. 

 Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprises (ADAE) ? the eponymous holding company ? made a big splash with an announcement soon after that it would invest Rs 2000 crore in Reliance Capital and another Rs 1000 crore in Reliance Energy.

 Ever since the acquisition, rumours swirled around the bourses that Anil would immediately try and carve out a space for himself as he tried to converge his energy, telephony and financial sector businesses with a huge dollop of entertainment thrown in. 

 Convergence is the new mantra that will soon yoke telephony, cable television and electricity and the mavens reckon that this will be one of the fast-growing segments in the economy. 

 The groups foray into the entertainment business was confirmed when it announced plans to acquire Prime Focus, a Rs 30-crore company promoted by Bollywood producer Naresh Malhotra. 

 Prime Focus is said to be one of Asias largest end-to-end post-production and visual effects services house. Prime Focus, investment banking officials say, is valued at over Rs 100 crore. 

 Immediately thereafter, Reliance Capital announced the acquisition of a majority stake in film producer Manmohan Shettys Adlabs Films at an estimated investment of Rs 360 crore.

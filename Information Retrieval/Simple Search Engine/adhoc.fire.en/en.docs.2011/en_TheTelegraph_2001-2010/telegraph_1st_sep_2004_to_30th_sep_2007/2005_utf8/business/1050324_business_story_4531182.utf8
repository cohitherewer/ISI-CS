 Status quo on MP Birla assets

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, March 23: Calcutta High Court today said there was no need at this point of time to appoint an independent administrator for the estate of Priyamvada Birla and MP Birla group companies.

 The application, seeking an administrator, was filed by M. P. Birla?s sisters ? Laxmi Bai Newar and Radha Devi Mohatta ? and four members of the Birla family, Krishna Kumar, Basant Kumar, Ganga Prasad and Yashovardhan. 

 Taking note of Lodha?s earlier undertaking that the assets will be preserved, Justice Kalyanjyoti Sengupta passed an order for the maintenance of status quo on the estate of Priyamvada Birla and her controlling interest in various companies. 

 The court also directed that to effect any changes in the board of directors of the MP Birla group companies, the petitioners and the court would have to be given seven days? notice.

 Both sides claimed victory after today?s judgment.

 ?We had given an undertaking that no assets in the estate of Priyamvada Birla will be sold and the court took note of that undertaking while passing the order,? said Debanjan Mandal of Fox amp; Mandal, the solicitor firm representing Lodha. 

 The Birla camp was equally happy. ?Our objective was to protect the estate and we think today?s order will restrain Lodha from selling the assets or changing the composition of the boards in MP Birla group companies,? said N. G. Khaitan of Khaitan amp; Co., the solicitor firm for the Birla family.

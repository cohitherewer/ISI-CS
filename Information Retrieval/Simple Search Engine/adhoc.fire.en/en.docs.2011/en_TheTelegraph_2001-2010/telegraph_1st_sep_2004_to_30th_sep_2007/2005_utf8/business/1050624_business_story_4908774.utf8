The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Price hurdle stays for Pak tea exports

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Picking faults

 Calcutta, June 23: Pakistan has not lowered the import duty on tea in its recent budget. The Indian tea industry has been hoping for a cut in the 20 per cent rate so that exports to Pakistan do not face a price resistance. 

 ?Pakistan has placed its budget recently but there has been no change in the duty structure,? said Gautam Bhalla of Warren Tea.

 A tea delegation from India will visit Pakistan early next month to find ways to increase exports to that country.

 The Indian tea industry was expecting some relief in the form of a cut in duty so that trade between the two countries could flourish. Pakistan consumes 140 million kg of tea annually and a major chunk of this volume is imported. 

 The industry is also upset as Pakistan is not buying large volumes of tea from India. The neighbouring country, which feels the variety is high priced, picks up small volumes of low-quality tea.

 ?They depend on Kenyan tea and the entire requirement is met through Mombassa auctions,? Bhalla added.

 Indian tea firms hope to send at least 10 million kg of tea to Pakistan, up from 4-5 million kg at present.

 C. K. Dhanuka, chairman of the Indian Tea Association, said the industry has set a target of exporting 7-8 million kg to Pakistan in the current year.

 What has buoyed the Indian tea industry, however, is the arrival of Iranian buyers to buy tea. A bigger team will visit India in early July.

 Indian tea exports in the first four months of this year have increased by 3 million kg, from 49.05 million kg in 2004 to 52.8 million kg, this year. Simultaneously, import of tea has been reduced to 2 million kg.

 Indian tea is trying to make fresh inroads in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Arab Emirates. 

 The Indian Tea Association is sending a delegation to all these countries.

 Meanwhile, Indian tea production is up 22 million kg in the first four months of this year. Production has shot up to 149 million kg from 127 million kg in the previous year.

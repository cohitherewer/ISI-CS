 Reliance, ONGC bag most oil blocks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 25: Reliance Industries has been awarded five oil and gas exploration blocks, while the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has bagged seven under the fifth round of the new exploration licensing policy. 

 ONGC will share four of the seven blocks won with Cairn Energy. ONGC chose Cairn Energy as a partner due to the UK-based companys high success rate in striking oil and gas in India. 

 ENI of Italy will partner ONGC in one block. 

 These blocks are among the 18 that the cabinet committee on economic affairs approved today after the petroleum ministry collated the final bids. 

 Oil India Ltd has bagged a block in Assam in partnership with Hindustan Petroleum.

 Niko Resources of Canada, the company which had discovered the giant gasfield in the offshore Krishna Godavri (KG) basin in partnership with Reliance, has also won a block in the Cambay basin. 

 However, companies like Petrobras of Brazil and Petronas of Malaysia have not made it to the final round. 

 Reliance is betting big on the deep-sea blocks. It has bagged four out of the six blocks on offer in this region. Three of these are in the eastern offshore KG basin, while one is in the Mahanadi basin. 

 The minimum investment committed by the bidders in the 18 blocks is approximately Rs 1,653 crore in the first phase and Rs 3,771 crore in all the three phases of exploration. 

 The production sharing contracts will provide that in case the contractor fails to complete the minimum work programme he would be required to carry out equivalent or additional exploration work, failing which they will be required to pay an equivalent amount of money to the government.

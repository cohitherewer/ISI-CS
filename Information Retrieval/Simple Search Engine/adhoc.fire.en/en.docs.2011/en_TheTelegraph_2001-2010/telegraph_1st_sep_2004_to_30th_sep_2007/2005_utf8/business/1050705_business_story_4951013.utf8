 Telcon plans to tap Saarc markets

 ANINDO DEY

 Jamshedpur, July 4: Telco Construction Equipment Company Limited (Telcon), a joint venture between Tata Motors and Hitachi, has set its sights on the Saarc countries.

 We hope to tap the rising demand for earth-moving and other heavy machines used in the construction sector in the Saarc region and its adjoining nations. This will be our first serious attempt to export our products, Telcon vice-president and general manager (sales and marketing) V.R. Raje said.

 The company plans to achieve a 30 to 40 per cent growth this financial year through this initiative. 

 In India, we have a 55 per cent market share in excavators. However, our expertise will be put to test when we have to compete in foreign markets. Moreover, a sustained exports market will also help us tide over crises at home, said Raje. 

 In 2004-05, our turnover was about Rs 1,000 crore. This year, we hope to increase it to Rs 1,400 crore. The company also plans to increase the production of its excavators from 2,000 machines last year to 2,500 this year, he added.

 Formerly a division of Tata Motors, Telcon was formed in 1999 to cater to growing demands for construction equipment. From a mere 800 machines then, the company today manufactures about 13 different types of excavators with capacities ranging from 7 tonnes to 120 tonnes.

 The company today launched its new-generation machines called the Zaxis series. The company will slowly phase out the earlier EX series in the next five years.

 The new machines are more user friendly with increased fuel efficiency, Telcon managing director Ranabir Sinha said.

 The new machines have a fully air-conditioned chamber for the operator and the entire hydraulic system is IT-based, officials added. 

 The machines also have an online data transfer facility, Raje said. These have also been launched in Japan, he added.

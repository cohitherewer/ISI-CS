 BoB keen on life insurance foray

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 23: The Bank of Baroda (BoB) plans to start stock brokerage and life insurance businesses to offer its customers the entire range of financial products. In the draft prospects filed with the Securities and Exchange Board of India for its forthcoming public issue, BoB said it would enter new business areas, forge alliances and make acquisitions for growth. 

 The public-sector bank is considering a joint venture with or a strategic acquisition of an existing service provider to enter the stock brokerage business. 

 Late last month, SBI Capital Markets Ltd, the subsidiary of the State Bank of India, ventured into the stock brokerage services by floating SBICAP Securities Ltd. The new company will offer services to both institutional and retail clients. 

 Besides buying and selling stocks on the bourses on behalf of its clients, the bank has also identified life insurance as a fee-based income generator for its growth.

 Apart from the commercial banking operations, BoB has been dealing in other businesses such as credit cards, asset management, primary dealership, merchant banking and other capital market services through its subsidiaries.

 We intend to expand into new lines of businesses, such as life insurance and stock brokerage, which are complementary to our existing lines of products and services. We may get into these businesses through joint ventures and alliances with leading product and service suppliers and, in some cases, by strategic acquisitions, the bank stated. 

 BoB is also looking at cross-selling of third-party products to increase its fee-based income.

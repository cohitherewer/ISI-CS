 New Delhi, Nov. 30: Societe Generale, the French asset management firm, today launched its onshore wealth management business in India.

 SG Private Banking (Asia-Pacific), Societe Generale?s arm, is also exploring the bancassurance segment in the country. ?We are in the process of finalising the bancassurance venture,? said Sandeep Sharma, senior vice-president.

 The group, which has already picked up a 37 per cent stake in SBI Asset Management Co, is eyeing high-networth individuals (HNI) whose combined value is estimated to be $260 billion. 

 SG Private Banking will target investors with an investible surplus of more than half-a-million dollars (approximately Rs 2.5 crore). There are about 60,000 individuals in this category.

 The company will also ?closely look at all opportunities? in wealth management, including its joint venture with the SBI asset management firm. Officials, however, refused to divulge any details.

 ?Research carried out by various agencies shows that the overall value of HNI is increasing at a compounded annual growth rate of 22 per cent per annum. Since we are a new player in the segment, our growth rates are expected to be even higher,? said Balakrishnan, managing director and global head of the Indian subcontinent of the group.

 Although officials refused to specify any target, they said the assets under management of the group are likely to reach a ?few billion dollars? in the next 3-5 years.

 First quarter date for listing of Anil firms 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 26: Shareholders of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) will have to wait until the first quarter of 2006 before they can trade in the shares of four companies that are being created as a result of the demerger within the Reliance group. 

 The four companies, which will become part of the Anil Ambani group, are Reliance Communications Ventures Ltd, Reliance Energy Ventures Ltd, Reliance Capital Ventures Ltd and Global Fuel Management Services.

 The Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) today announced that it will endeavour to list the four entities in the first quarter of 2006. 

 Shareholders of RIL will get shares in each of the four entities. Shareholders of RIL will get shares in the ratio of 1:1 in each of the four entities.

 In a press statement issued today, ADAG said there was no possibility of listing of shares and/or derivative contracts of these companies close to January 18 as the record date for the demerger itself is January 25.

 Investors whose names figure in the register of members as shareholders of RIL as on January 25, will be entitled to free shares of the four companies. 

 However, those who buy shares of the petrochemical giant on January 18 and thereafter will not be entitled to the free shares of these four companies on such purchases, the group said. Shares of RIL will enter the no-delivery period after January 17, ahead of the record date.

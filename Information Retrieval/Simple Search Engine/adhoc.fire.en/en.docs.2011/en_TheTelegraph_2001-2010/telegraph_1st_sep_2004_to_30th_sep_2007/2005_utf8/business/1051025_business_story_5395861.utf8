 Bankers divided over rate riddle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 24: On the eve of the busy season credit policy, there is a clear division among bankers on whether Reserve Bank governor Y.V. Reddy should bite the bullet and take a U turn on interest rates.

 HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said: Interest rates will inch up. I may be wrong, but it could go up by a quarter to half a per cent. The increase seems justified as inflation is rising, crude prices are at a high and US fed rates are inching higher. 

 Parekh hedged his statement by admitting he could be wrong. I dont think it will be a steep increase, he added.

 Public sector bank chiefs were more muted in their response as they fear big brother finance ministry is watching every statement on interest rates. 

 Bank of Baroda chairman A.K. Khandelwal now feels that in the short term interest rates appear stable. He was, however, earlier speculated a 25-50 basis points hike in interest rates. 

 Cherian Verghese, Union Bank of India CMD, said: Our hope is stability will continue and the RBI will resist the temptation to hike interest rates. There is enough liquidity with the banks and we can manage for the short-term, he added.

 Already stock market investors felt the tremors as they expect interest rates to tread higher ground. The BSE Sensex plummeted 148 points on Monday. The question on every investors minds is whether the RBI will bite the bullet and tweak interest rates. 

 Only Y.V. Reddy has the answers.

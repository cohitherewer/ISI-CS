 Satan Santa stuns all

 Hong Kong, Dec. 14: Indian activist Vandana Shiva and some American non-governmental organisations today sprang a surprise by staging a satire at the WTO convention centre. 

 The skit lampooned WTO director-general Pascal Lamy who was depicted as Satan Santa. Clad in a red Santa outfit with horns to add the Satanic touch, Canadian activist Tony Clarke and his supporters entertained onlookers for a good 10 minutes. 

 The protesters had walked down from the fifth floor of the convention centre, which has been allotted to the NGOs. 

 However, given the orderly nature of the protest and the fact that it did not disrupt the proceedings, the authorities did not take any action against the protesters. 

 The satire was directed at the move to privatise water, health and education facilities, which formed a part of the earlier GATS round and could return in the current WTO round.

 Calcutta, Oct. 14: Duncans Industries Ltd, the G.P. Goenka group flagship, is hoping to turn around its business in the next financial year.

 The company will piggyback on the fertiliser unit at Panki to return to black in 2006-07. The plant has re-opened after a hiatus of three years. 

 Addressing shareholders at the annual general meeting today ? which eventually took place after a gap of four years ? Goenka, chairman of the company, said the fertiliser unit would result in positive cash flow from December.

 We are expecting Rs 400 crore business from fertilisers and another Rs 125 crore from tea this year, he said.

 Duncans is targeting a Rs 1,000-crore turnover from the fertiliser business in 2006-07.

 The company is negotiating with GAIL (India) Ltd and Petronet LNG Ltd for the supply of gas to its unit. This is expected to reduce the cost of operations.

 Goenka said according to the agreement signed in 2001 with the two companies, they had proposed to lay a 15-kilometre pipeline to the plants. 

 Speaking about the tea business, Goenka said there was a crop loss of 12-15 per cent due to a 15-day strike in north Bengal. The company has shifted the packet tea business to an associate company, Duncans Tea. 

 The decision was taken since Duncans Industries does not have sufficient working capital to service three lines of business ? fertiliser, bulk tea and packet tea.

 Duncanss retail outlet chain, Duncans Tea House, is doing well in the market, he said, adding that it would take time to generate substantial revenues. 

 Following Sebi guidelines, promoters will have to lower their stake in Duncans Industries to 55 per cent from 68 per cent, Goenka said.

 Recently, Duncans had been granted a corporate debt-restructuring package by the CDR cell, which included reduction of interest rates, rescheduling of loan repayment and a contribution from promoters. 

 Goenka said promoters have already infused Rs 30 crore into the company.

 The cash flow from the fertiliser unit will also help the company repay its 60,000 fixed-deposit holders from the fourth quarter of this financial year. 

 The total amount of fixed-deposits is Rs 90 crore.

 For the last four to five years, the company has not been able to pay the FD holders.

 New Delhi, Nov. 28: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today underlined the importance of private capital for economic advancement but opposed unbridled globalisation that compromised on the country?s ?self-reliance?.

 ?We are in favour of globalisation. It is a fact of life and nobody can deny it. However, I want to make it clear that globalisation should be a reciprocal process and should not come at the cost of our self-reliance,? he told leaders of the food processing industry at a meeting organised by Ficci here.

 Bhattacharjee also allayed fears that the CPI(M)-led state government was against infusion of private capital per se. ?We need private capital ? whether it is domestic or foreign. Without foreign direct investment we just cannot advance,? he said.

 This is Bhattacharjee?s second visit at an industry meeting organised by Ficci in the capital in the last one month. 

 The Bengal chief minister also rued the poor record of land reforms in most states of the country. ?Lack of political will to implement land reforms comprehensively in the entire country is a major problem,? he said.

 In Bengal, he said 72 per cent of the entire agricultural land was owned by small and marginal farmers.

 The chief minister urged the food processing industry to invest in the state and said his government had identified eight locations for food parks. Besides, the government is also in setting up six agri-export zones, which will cater to different produces such as pineapple, mangoes, litchis, potatoes and other vegetables.

 He also said the government was trying to set up multi-purpose cold-storage facilities in the state.

 ?The government alone cannot do it. We want domestic and foreign participation for the purpose,? Bhattacharjee said.

 In fact, the proposal of the German Metro Group to set up a food chain in the vicinity of Calcutta is currenlty being vetted.

 In recent times, Bengal has attracted private investment in the food sector with brands such as Frito Lays and Dabur setting up production facilities.

 China, Bhattacharjee said, was way ahead of India in terms of food processing. ?We are closely observing how they are advancing. It is important to create good infrastructure, develop an efficient market mechanism and upgrade technology. These are areas which need to be taken up on a priority basis,? he said.

 Bengal, the chief minister said, holds out good prospects for the food processing industry. ?There are 50 climatic zones in the country and in Bengal itself there are six climatic zones compatible with numerous fruits and vegetables,? he said.

 The state, he said, was one of the largest producers of rice, vegetables, fish, betel-leaf and pineapples amongst all the states in the country. ?The agricultural growth rate in Bengal is 4 per cent whereas the country-wide average is 2 per cent,? the chief minister said.

 Union food processing minister Subodh Kant Sahay underlined the role played by state governments in promoting the food processing industry. ?I would like to compliment the state of Bengal which has taken major steps in boosting this sector. Of the 51 food parks sanctioned across the country, Bengal alone accounts for eight of them,? he said.

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: HDFC Bank has applied to the Reserve Bank of India for floating a non-banking financial company (NBFC).

 An NBFC will enable us to penetrate the smaller markets. We have applied a month ago, managing director Aditya Puri said.

 Through the NBFC, the bank wants to capture the business segment dominated by unscrupulous money-lenders.

 The NBFC will help us lend smaller amounts to purchase two-wheelers and for personal use, he added.

 HDFC Bank, which mainly has operations in the metros, has decided to enter the semi-urban and semi-rural areas in a big way.

 The semi-urban and semi-rural areas are witnessing an exponential growth. We have to capture those markets, he said.

 Half of HDFC Banks retail lending is in the semi-urban and rural areas. Of this, 37 per cent is given to the priority sector, Puri added.

 The SME business of the bank is also witnessing a robust growth of 50-75 per cent. 

 The bank has recently launched gold loans against jewellery. The scheme was first launched in Kerala and the bank has now decided to spread the plan across the country.

 The gold loan is mainly aimed at the middle-class and lower middle-class people and the size of the loan is to the tune of Rs 20,000-Rs 40,000, Puri added.

 The credit card business of the bank is also witnessing good growth. It has already issued 1.6 million cards and every month it is adding 100,000 customers to its existing portfolio.

 The bank is also in the process of entering into alliances with banks in London and the US to provide facilities to the Indian diaspora in those countries.

 The bank has registered a business of Rs 54000 crore in 2004-05 and expects to grow 25-30 per cent in the current financial year.

 HDFC Bank had opened 150 branches last year and has similar plans this year too.

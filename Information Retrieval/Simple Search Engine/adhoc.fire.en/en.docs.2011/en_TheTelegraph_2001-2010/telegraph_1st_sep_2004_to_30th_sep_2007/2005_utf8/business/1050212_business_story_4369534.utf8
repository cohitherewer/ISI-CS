 Slugfest scars on Lever net

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 11: Hindustan Lever reported a 28.38 per cent decline in net profit at Rs 1,208.4 crore for the year ended December 2004 against Rs 1687.34 crore in 2003.

 For the quarter to December, post-tax earnings dipped 36.4 per cent to Rs 357 crore, while pre-tax profit declined 31 per cent to Rs 446 crore. The topline bore the scars of price-wars as net sales barely inched up to Rs 2600.83 crore. The Lever board has declared a dividend of 250 per cent.

 Chairman M. S. Banga, however, believes the worst is over. ?Much of the substantial restructuring has been done,? said Banga, just named president of Unilever?s foods division.

 ?It has been a journey to re-equip ourselves to new market needs. Our agenda is simple ? to drive growth in sales and in market share,? he said after announcing the results.

 Strategic pricing in laundry and shampoo helped, but the foods business was where the sales machine sputtered. 

 Analysts had never thought the going would be easy but none expected a 36 per cent slide in quarterly profit. ?We were warned by the results announced on Thursday by Unilever. So, this has softened the blow somewhat,? said Arun Kejriwal, a strategist at Angel Broking.

 On Thursday, Unilever reported flat 2004 earnings. The global major said net profit before exceptional items and amortisation of goodwill and intangibles rose 1 per cent to 3.97 billion euros ($5.07 billion), which represented a 4 per cent rise when taken at constant exchanges rates. 

 Markets appeared to be trusting Banga when he predicted better times ahead. The Hindustan Lever stock closed at Rs 155.30, an increase from Thursday?s Rs 154.

 In the soaps and detergents business, Lever saw its Rin, Surf and Wheel brands work up a rich lather on sales. Shampoo volumes grew at more than 28.8 per cent for the third consecutive quarter. To build brands, the advertising spend in home and personal care were hiked 25 per cent over last year?s levels. Many say this, along with the rising cost of inputs, led to the profit squeeze.

 The company had to sell cheap to keep pace with arch rival Procter amp; Gamble?s race to gain market share. Lux, SunSilk, Wheel, Pepsodent Close Up, Lipton and Brooke Bond were among the key Hind Lever brands that were scorched in the heat of fierce competition.

 ?As we go through the price cuts, we?ll see the growth in numbers. The world will come around to see the three stages of growth in volumes, value and profit,? Banga said. 

 On the basis of current market equations, Lever officials said they are looking to turn the corner soon. ?We are seeing an uptick and it augurs well for us,? Banga added.

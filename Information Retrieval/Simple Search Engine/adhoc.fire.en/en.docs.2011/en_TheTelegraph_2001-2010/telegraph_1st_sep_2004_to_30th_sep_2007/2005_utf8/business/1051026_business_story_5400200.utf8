 Stock loan enigma for bourses

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 25: Stocks went through a bone-jarring roller-coaster this afternoon, the swings caused by conflicting theories about banks capital market loan limits.

 The sensex closed 71 points higher at 7991.74 but the gains were preceded by volatility typical of recent weeks. The 30-share index opened strong at 7974.17 but fluctuated widely on alternate bouts of buying and selling.

 The key market barometer trimmed its gains more than 50 per cent from its intra-day high of 8074.08 before ending above Mondays close of 7920.80, a net rise of 0.90 per cent.

 Dealers attributed the rally to short covering in futures and options by high net worth investors. They have turned nervous after foreign institutional investors (FIIs) dumped shares valued at Rs 1,195 crore last week.

 The volume of business on Dalal Street was Rs 2406.49 crore, down from Rs 2437.47 crore on Monday. 

 State Bank of India clocked the highest turnover of Rs 261.39 crore followed by Reliance Industries at Rs 211.84 crore. The Reliance stock gained Rs 10.75 to Rs 767.55, while the SBI scrip was stronger by Rs 21.05 at its closing quote of Rs 884.80. Part of the decline was caused by reports of income-tax raids on many stock brokers in the city, though there are unconfirmed indications that the swoop took place after market close.

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 29: Parliamentarians from India and the island nation of Singapore today joined hands to form India Singapore Parliamentary Forum (ISPF), a lobby group, which business leaders of both the nations hope will help give them a voice among policy-makers. 

 Launching the forum, the visiting prime minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong said, The relationship between the two countries will broaden after the two countries sign comprehensive economic cooperation agreement (CECA). He added, However, what is important is that the political parties of the two countries (including the opposition) lend support to important policy initiatives.

 The parliamentary forum will look at strengthening socio-economic and cultural ties, widening the education sector, giving recommendations on the defence sector and encouraging research and development related work. Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), which helped set up the forum, will provide it with secretarial back-up.

 The forum will provide a platform to engage in constructive dialogue, to understand pertinent issues pending between the two countries and suggest resolutions, said Milind Deora, a Member of Parliament from South Mumbai and chairperson of the forum.

 Agreed Saroj Kumar Poddar, senior vice president, Ficci. 

 Poddar said the ISPF will give immense opportunity for the business communities of both the countries to put forth their view points. He said the forum would encourage communication links between the trader and investor community as well. 

 This is the sixth parliamentary forum organised by Ficci. The chamber has similar forums running with countries like the US, UK, Germany, Japan and the European Union.

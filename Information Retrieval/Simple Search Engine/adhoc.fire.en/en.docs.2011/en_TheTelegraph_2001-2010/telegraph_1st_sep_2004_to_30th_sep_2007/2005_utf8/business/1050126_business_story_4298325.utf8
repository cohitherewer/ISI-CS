 Maran: Logging in

 New Delhi, Jan. 25: Dayanidhi Maran, the Union minister of communications and information technology, today asked the domestic infotech companies to focus more on countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America to export software.

 The government was committed to help the small information companies get the necessary visibility and marketing opportunities to enable them to become important players in the global IT market.

 Maran also urged the countries in Asia and Africa to join hands to enhance their infotech skills and the strengths available in each country. 

 Delivering the keynote address at the ?Interface with ambassadors of Latin America, Africa, CIS and select Asean countries? organised by the Export Promotion Council, Maran said, ?Indiasoft 2005 will be held for the first time in Chennai in March and would afford an excellent opportunity for entrepreneurs from your countries (Latin America, Africa, CIS and Asean countries) to interact with our software companies and explore possibilities of working out strategic alliances, including joint ventures.?

 Highlighting the achievements of Indian IT companies, the minister said a study in the US showed that 80 per cent of the top American companies have preferred Indian software and services.

 ?We are extremely conscious that 90 per cent of all our exports (all products) are to the North American and European markets. During 2003-04, the percentage of exports to Latin American countries is a mere $4.90 million, CIS countries is just $0.45 million, entire Africa is $154.63 million and Asean is $428.16 million,? said Maran.

 He said, ?We believe that it is time that people in other regions work closely with us and share the benefits of our IT strengths.?

 During 2003-04, exports of electronics and computer software services grew by 33 per cent to touch $14.28 billion. ?If this trend continues, we are confident of achieving the export target of $50 billion by 2008,? said Maran.

 The minister also pointed out that of the 117 companies in the world that are classified as SEI-CMM level 5 certified, as many as 80 are based in India. About 300 IT companies have achieved ISO-9000 or SEI-quality-level certification.

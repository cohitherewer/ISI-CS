 Coal India to regulate supply to power units

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Aug. 28: The Union power ministry has asked Coal India Ltd to regulate supplies to the state electricity boards that are not clearing dues.

 The arrears stand at Rs 3,490 crore for 2004-05. Of this, the power sector alone (mostly SEBs) is a Rs 3029-crore defaulter. According to Coal India, the the first-quarter dues are Rs 3,379 crore.

 We had been requesting the power ministry to take some action so that Coal India and its subsidiaries can get their money. The power ministry has asked us to regulate coal supply, officials said.

 If Coal India starts regulating supply, the power situation will worsen at a time when many parts of the country are facing blackouts. 

 Nearly 78 per cent of the coal produced is used by power firms.

 Officials said the power sector has been clamouring for a steady flow of coal. The coal ministry has recently approved supplies of 73.92 million tonnes to the power sector for the second quarter of this fiscal, up 4.26 million tonnes over the same period last year. 

 Coal supply to the sector during the first quarter increased 3.5 per cent over the previous year. 

 A sub-group in the coal ministry will monitor the performance of various power utilities. It has also been decided that 59 captive plants will get 7.1 million tonnes of coal in the second quarter. 

 In the first quarter, 84 per cent of the coal production was supplied to the power sector. During this time, the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) reported a 3.4 per cent growth in generation. 

 Cement plants, including those with captive power units, will get 3.30 million tonnes of coal in the second quarter. Cement firms received 14.94 million tonnes of indigenous coal in the first quarter. 

 Coal India officials said as a result of concerted efforts by the ministries of coal and power, the stock position in many generating stations has improved. 

 Output plans

 Coal India has formulated an emergency production plan to raise coal output by 71.3 million tonnes to meet the feedstock shortage in the country.

 It has recast the production plan by raising the coal production target to 508 million tonnes in 2011-12, 63 million tonnes more than the earlier projection.

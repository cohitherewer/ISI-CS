 ABN Amro windfall for technology trinity

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Big call

 Mumbai, Sept. 1: The Netherlands-based ABN Amro will pay $2.2 billion or Rs 9,680 crore to five entities, including three Indian firms, to manage and develop its systems.

 The bulk of the contracts under the IT outsourcing deal were awarded to US groups IBM and Accenture. Back home, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys and Patni Computers bagged the remaining contracts. 

 The European bank said the five-year contract will generate an annual savings of 258 million euros from 2007. TCS and Infosys will earn revenues in excess of $250 million each in five years.

 ?We expect this programme to contribute to the savings in line with earlier estimates made by the bank while improving IT services within the group,? ABN Amro chief operating officer Hugh Scott-Barrett said.

 Even though the financial details of the contract were not made public, a source said IBM will garner revenues worth 1.5 billion euros from the deal. TCS pegged its revenues at over 200 million euros, while Infosys said the deal was worth a shade less than the Tata firm.

 However, according to Merrill Lynch, the TCS side of the order will reach $350-400 million (Rs 1540-1760 crore) over five years, while Infosys could generate $250 million (Rs 1,100 crore) in the same period.

 TCS will provide application support and enhancement services for the bank?s operations in the Netherlands, Brazil as well as its private client business globally.

 Infosys will also provide application support, while IBM will look after the bank?s IT infrastructure. ABN Amro said the contract will result in 1,500 redundancies in the next 18 months and will reduce the number of IT jobs within the group from 5,000 to 1,800.

 ?The milestone engagement with ABN Amro is an irrevocable validation of our global delivery strategy,? TCS chief executive office and managing director S. Ramadorai said.

 ?This is the first engagement that allows TCS to utilise its global delivery model in its entirety,? Ramadorai added. 

 ?The strategy of TCS to grow in Europe and other markets to achieve its global vision is beginning to bear fruit,? executive vice-president N. Chandrasekaran said. 

 ?This is a landmark deal for Infosys,? said Nandan M. Nilekani, CEO, president and managing director, Infosys.

 Hint of forex kitty shuffle

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Reddy: Time for change

 Mumbai, March 11: The Reserve Bank of India is planning to churn its foreign exchange basket, reducing the weightage of dollar and giving more representation to other currencies.

 The hint came from none other than RBI governor Y. V. Reddy, who was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India here today.

 ?Yes, it is being discussed. We are always discussing. It?s a continuous process,? the RBI governor said on being asked whether the central bank was planning to diversify its foreign exchange reserves.

 ?It is an ongoing debate with all central banks,? he added.

 Significantly, Reddy?s comment comes a day after Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi aired a similar view on the need to diversify foreign exchange reserves. While the Japanese finance ministry subsequently clarified that there was no such plan for now, Koizumi?s observation did put pressure on the dollar.

 In recent times, the greenback has been under pressure because of the US current account deficit. The possibility of central banks of other countries churning their forex kitty is also putting considerable strain on the dollar.

 India?s foreign exchange reserves are now at a record high of over $135 billion due to huge inflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs). While most of the reserves are in dollars, the basket also includes other currencies.

 Inflation projection

 Reddy projected that the rate of inflation for 2004-05 will be lower than the estimated 6.5 per cent and the gross domestic product (GDP) growth will be higher than the projected 6-6.5 per cent. 

 ?For this year we expect growth to be better than that anticipated in November and we expect inflation to be slightly lower,? he said. In its mid-term review of the annual policy for 2004-05, RBI had raised the inflation forecast to 6.5 per cent from 5 per cent estimated in May last year, while lowering the GDP estimates to 6-6.5 from 6.5-7 per cent.

 ONGC sniffs opportunities

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, July 5: The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation is interested in picking up a stake in Gujarat State Petroleum Corporations recently discovered gas field in the eastern offshore Krishna-Godavari basin.

 It would be a win-win situation for both, as GSPC, which is a small company, would get the financial support to develop the field, while ONGC would be able to increase its hydrocarbon reserves, a senior ONGC official told The Telegraph.

 Apart from this, GSPC would be able to utilise ONGCs expertise and trained manpower to develop the gas field.

 Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi has already stated that Gujarat State Petroleum (GSPC) would issue an initial public offering to raise funds for developing the field. GSPC expects to start commercial production by the end of 2007. It is to be seen whether GSPC is open to the ONGC offer.

 Although a deal would commercially benefit both, political differences between the BJP-ruled Gujarat and the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre could come in the way. 

 Gail (India) Ltd may also be interested in the GSPC field as it has been already nominated to pick up the central governments share of the gas. This is not a major issue because ONGC and Gail would have to abide by the petroleum ministrys decision. 

 According to senior ONGC officials, though GSPCs gas find is a significant one, it is too early to quantify the exact amount until more appraisal wells are drilled in the 75 square-km field. 

 However, the fact that the gas column is 800 to 850 metres thick and the same geological structure extends across 75 sq km is encouraging. It has the potential of turning out to be a huge discovery, officials said.

 Compared to this the recent ONGC discovery in the KG basin is not as big as the thickness of the gas column is only 45 metres, and the area of the geological structure is also smaller. 

 However, ONGCs contribution to gas finds by other companies like Reliance and GSPC cannot be overlooked because it had first mapped out the hydrocarbon basins in the country. On the basis of this oil and gas hunt is moving forward. For instance, GSPC had proceeded on the 2D seismic data, which was first complied by ONGC. 

 The Gujarat company had also hired US-based Petrotel to interpret the seismic data compiled last year and help it pin-point the drilling site. 

 GSPC claims that the field contains more than 20 trillion cubic feet of gas on the basis of a successful well, which flowed 10 million standard cubic feet of gas per day from only a 10 metre interval.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 VIP couple packs bags for a new journey

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 3: Its time to say goodbye ? goes the ad jingle for VIP Luggage. The owners of the travel kit maker have chosen to move on, too ? without each other.

 Dilip and Gita Piramal, the husband and wife who sit on the boards of Blow Plast and VIP Industries, are going their separate ways, a personal decision that has necessitated the restructuring of the boards of the two luggage companies. Gita has already stepped down as a director.

 This is a personal matter. There will not be any repercussions on our business, Dilip told The Telegraph. The divorce, which he described as amicable, came through in April. Dilip has built a formidable business in making travel bags and luggage, which is ranked along side leading global companies like Delsey. 

 Gita has made a mark as a corporate historian who tracks leading families in the country closely. She has been editing a niche magazine called Smart Manager for over two years.

 She has penned Business Maharajas and Business Legends, and co-authored Managing Radical Change and World Class in India with late Sumantra Ghoshal. Gita did not respond to a message left on her cell phone. 

 Dilip, who is in his early fifties, will be tying the knot once again, with Shalini Agrawal, on June 18, six days after his daughter, Aparna, walks down the aisle. I was waiting for my daughter to get married, Dilip added. 

 Gita has joined BP Ergo, though Dilip said she is not on the boards of group holding companies.

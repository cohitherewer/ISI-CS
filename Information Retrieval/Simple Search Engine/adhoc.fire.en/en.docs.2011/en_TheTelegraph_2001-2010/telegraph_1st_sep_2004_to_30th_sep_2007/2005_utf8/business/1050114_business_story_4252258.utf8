 Punjab Tractors to prune SML stake

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Jan. 13: Punjab Tractors has said it will sell a part of its stake in Swaraj Mazda, the commercial vehicle manufacturer, to Sumitomo Corp of Japan.

 Punjab Tractor?s board of directors has decided to sell up to 1.57 million shares out of its holding of 3.05 million equity in Swaraj Mazda Ltd, the company informed the BSE today.

 Sumitomo is battling Actis, a private equity investor, for control of Swaraj Mazda. Swaraj Mazda Ltd (SML) is a joint venture between Punjab Tractors and Japanese giants, Mazda and Sumitomo. Mazda and Sumitomo own 15.6 per cent and 10.4 per cent equity respectively in SML. Sumitomo intends to acquire an additional 15 per cent in the company.

 Actis owns around 12 per cent in the company and has come out with an open offer to pick up another 25 per cent. Last week, Actis raised its open offer price from Rs 315 to Rs 400 per share.

 The proposed transaction will raise the combined holding of Mazda and Sumitomo in SML to 41 per cent.

 SML?s technical collaboration with Mazda has expired. Sources said the management had approached Sumitomo to support the firm?s future product development.

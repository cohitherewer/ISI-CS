 Tata DTH project awaits nod

 SHUCHI BANSAL

 New Delhi, Dec. 2: The Tata Sky DTH project has still not received all government clearances to launch operations.

 The direct-to-home broadcasting project ? an 80:20 venture between the Tatas and Rupert Murdochs STAR ? is stuck at the department of telecommunications (DoT).

 It awaits clearance from the standing advisory committee on radio frequency allocation, which is chaired by the telecom secretary.

 A Tata Sons director confirmed that the project was stuck at the DoT. Tata Sky chief executive officer Vikram Kaushik said: We have not been given any reasons as to what is causing the delay. 

 The DTH project was cleared by the ministry of information and broadcasting in May 2005. However, till the DoT gives it the clearance, the company cannot get the operational licence. 

 We plan to launch the service in the second quarter of 2006, Kaushik said. 

 Tata Sky applied for a DTH licence in early 2004. The ministry took nearly one-and-a-half years to clear the application as it sought several clarifications from the company.

 Later, it cleared the Tata Sky proposal along with those of Kalanidhi Marans Sun Direct TV and Anil Ambanis DTH project. 

 Zee, which obtained a DTH licence some years ago, launched its service in October 2003.

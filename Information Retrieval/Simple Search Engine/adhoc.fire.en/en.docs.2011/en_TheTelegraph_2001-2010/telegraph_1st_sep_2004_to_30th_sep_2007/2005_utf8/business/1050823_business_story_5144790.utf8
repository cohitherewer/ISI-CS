 Calcutta, Aug. 22: You have seen nothing as yet.

 This is how T.V. Ramachandran, director-general of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), summed up the achievements of the GSM industry in the last 10 years while outlining the growth of the sector over the next five years.

 The industry has set itself an ambitious target of 500 million subscribers by 2010, which Ramachandran prefers to call a conservative estimate. GSM operators expect to increase the user base to 250 million by December 2007 from 54 million at present.

 It has been a roller-coaster ride for the industry. From 1 million subscribers in 1999, we have grown almost 60-fold today. Moreover, every 1 per cent growth in telecom results in a 3 per cent growth in GDP, said Rajan Mittal, joint managing director of Bharti Tele-Ventures.

 The sector has generated 36 lakh jobs with a likely increase of 30 per cent over the next 12 months, said Ramachandran. The industry generates Rs 14500 crore per annum for the government with an annual GDP contribution of Rs 31,000 crore.

 Despite these achievements, the industry feels that it can boost growth by tapping 800 million people, who are outside the purview of cellular networks in the country.

 Networking the entire country will, however, require investments of around Rs 100,000 crore, almost double the amount that has been invested in the last decade.

 3G networks, enabling faster data transaction, are expected to be rolled out by 2006. These will enable next generation applications like mobile payments, telemedicine and e-education through wireless broadband.

 Issues like spectrum allocation, taxes and levies, access deficit charge (ADC) and disbursement of the Universal Service Obligation (USO) fund still remain to be resolved.

 Looking back, the industry agrees that while liberalisation of the telecom sector in 1992 opened a new chapter in communications, the most defining point has been the National Telecom Policy (NTP) in 1999.

 NTP 99 brought the industry back from the brink of collapse with accumulated losses nearing Rs 65,000 crore in 1998, said Ramachandran. With a 10-year licence fee amounting to Rs 20,000 crore, a 1.2-million subscriber base and loss-making networks, operators were unable to pay their quarterly instalments. With NTP 99, the government entered into a revenue sharing arrangement with operators, thus absorbing some of their losses and bringing down licence fees to Rs 15,000 crore.

 The 1999 policy also brought down tariffs from Rs 14 to Rs 6 per minute and increased the subscriber base from 1.2 million to 1.88 million in 2000.

 The second important move was to open up the sector further and bring in the third and fourth operator. This increased competition and reduced tariffs to around Rs 4 per minute, said Ramachandran. The introduction of the calling party pays (CPP) regime making all incoming calls to mobile networks free in 2003 grew the subscribers base to 13 million and brought outgoing call rates to Rs 1.60 per minute.

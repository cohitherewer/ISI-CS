 Bengal to weed out tea park hurdles

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, June 12: The Bengal government is keen to remove the hurdles in the way of the proposed Rs 24-crore tea park. The project was conceived as part of the state governments move to revive the tea industry.

 The government has called a high-level meeting next week, which will be attended by the Tea Board chairman, chief of Calcutta Port Trust and the state commerce and industry secretary Sabysachi Sen. It will identify the major roadblocks and expedite the implementation of the project. 

 The Bengal government had approached the Union commerce ministry to accord special economic zone (SEZ) status to the proposed park. But the ministry is not willing. 

 The state government is eager to sort out the issue because it feels that the park can help the industry that is reeling under a financial crisis. If the project gets the SEZ status, the industry will be able to enjoy some tax sops. The governments major objective is getting the SEZ status for the project.

 The Bengal government is lobbying the Union commerce ministry to get the status and financial assistance from the Centre for export promotion.

 Sources said talks were held between the commerce ministry and the state government but nothing concrete emerged. The proposed tea park project, which is being set up near the Calcutta port, is a joint effort by Tea Board and Calcutta Port Trust.

 Senior tea industry officials said, Without the SEZ status, the industry will not be willing to set up shop in the tea park.

 C. K. Dhanuka, chairman of Indian Tea Association, said: We have heard about the proposed tea park. The industry will support the initiative. The proposal is yet to come to our table. Tea board officials were, however, tight-lipped on the issue. Deputy chairman R. S. Shukla refused comment on the status of the tea park. 

 The industrys response to the project has remained lukewarm with the players preferring to wait till the project gets SEZ assurance. The tea park project is aimed at helping the ailing tea industry to revive by offering better infrastructure.

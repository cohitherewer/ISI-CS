 Integrity of PowerGrid

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 8: Powergrid Corporation of India Ltd (PGCIL) today launched an Integrity Pact to be developed as a software package soon. 

 This Integrity Pact is aimed to bring in greater transparency in tendering and procurement procedures, which were originally devised by the Transparency International (TI).

 The TI module of the Integrity Pact has been adopted by various organisations the world over. Several governments have adopted it also.

 Launching the initiative, PGCIL chairman R. P. Singh said, Suiting to the need of our country the Integrity Pact in PowerGrid has been drafted over and above the existing provisions of checks and balances as a method of undertaking to observe absolute honesty and integrity in the contracts. 

 Initially the Integrity Pact shall be a document which will be signed both by PGCIL and the bidder/vendor before initiation of the tender/contract whereby both parties would undertake to have complete fairness in their dealings and refrain from any corrupt practices.

 In this pact, PGCIL commits to maintain full probity in the contract and also to take exemplary action against its own employees concerned in case of breach of this pact, Singh said.

 Under the pact, the bidder/contractor is required to make similar commitments on observance of absolute integrity and honesty both in the tendering process and the execution of the work, if awarded. 

 The penalty aspect is also provided in this pact which will be regulated within the scope of this pact, and, in case of serious transgression a bidder/contractor can be debarred from future activities of PGCIL for a period of between 12 months and three years, depending on severity of the case.

 Cancellation of bid guarantee has also been provided according to the severity of the transgression.

 Iran-India pipeline hits rough patch

 S. P. S. PANNU 

 Long way to go

 New Delhi, Feb 20: There seems to be a hex on the proposed Iran-India gas pipeline via Pakistan that has been mired in sands of political brinkmanship in the South Asian region for decades.

 Just when everything seemed hunky-dory and talks were about to begin with the officials in these countries, questions are being raised about the economics of the entire project now that Pakistan is insisting on an annual transit fee of $600 million.

 The pipeline is already fraught with security risk and will always remain hostage to the ups and downs of India?s relationship with Pakistan. But the huge transit fee that Pakistan is insisting on would render it entirely unviable, say experts.

 A senior Petronet LNG official told The Telegraph that if Pakistan insists on a $600-million transit fee for the pipeline, it would be cheaper to import the natural gas from Iran in liquefied form. This would skirt the security risk that hovers over the pipeline option.

 Experts reckon that transporting gas through a pipeline works out to be cheaper than liquefied natural gas (LNG) if the distance is less than 3,500 kms. Over longer distances, LNG can compete with the pipeline option.

 The proposed India-Iran pipeline is expected to cover around 3,000 km, which would give it an edge over LNG. However, the exorbitant fee that Pakistan hopes to rake in, negates the cost advantage vis-?-vis the LNG option, the official said.

 Gail chairman Proshanto Banerjee feels that importing gas in the form of compressed natural gas is also potentially a good option. In fact, he has included it as one of the options of transporting natural gas from Myanmar to the east coast, where considerable headway has been made in talks on a transnational pipeline.

 Clearly, Pakistan has nothing to lose if the pipeline project goes through since it will get the gas virtually free by paying for it out of the transit fee it gets from India.

 Iran is desperately eyeing the huge Indian market, cornered as it is by the US. Even companies such as British Petroleum, engaged in big business with the US, are keeping away from Iran.

 India recognises the high security risk and does not want to be associated with the construction, maintenance or operation of the pipeline, which will pass through 760 kms of Pakistani territory.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar has clearly stated that India will not enter into any agreement with Pakistan and deal only with Iran on the issue. It would be Tehran?s responsibility to strike a deal with Pakistan for laying the pipeline and deliver the gas safely to the Indian border, the minister said. 

 Iran, on the other hand, wants to stop short and deliver the gas at its own border. This will enable it to avoid investing in the Pakistani stretch and facing the security risk that the pipeline operations will run into in Pakistan. 

 Petroleum secretary S. C. Tripathi has stated that India will also seek comfort from Iran in the form of commitment to supply liquefied natural gas in case supplies are disrupted. 

 He has also disclosed plans of building strategic storage facilities in Rajasthan or Gujarat as an insurance against disruption in supplies.

 However, the question still remains whether it is prudent for India to invest thousands of crores in power plants and other industries dependent on this gas. 

 Frequent disruptions in the pipeline with or without the connivance of a hostile government could render these investments unviable.

 The ministry of external affairs had been insisting that the Pakistan-sponsored violence in Jammu and Kashmir cannot be delinked from the pipeline. 

 The petroleum ministry, however, wants to take up the pipeline as a separate issue purely on the economic merits of the case.

 Last week?s cabinet decision seems to have given the petroleum ministry wider powers at least for the moment to negotiate on issues linked with the proposed transnational pipelines.

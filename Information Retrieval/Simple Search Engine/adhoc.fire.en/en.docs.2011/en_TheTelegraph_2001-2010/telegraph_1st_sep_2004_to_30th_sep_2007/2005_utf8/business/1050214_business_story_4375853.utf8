 Banks cold to special tea fund

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Plucked out 

 Calcutta, Feb. 13: Public sector banks are not willing to contribute to the special fund for the tea industry announced by commerce minister Kamal Nath last September.

 The initial corpus of the fund, aimed at rejuvenating the tea industry was pegged at Rs 1,000 crore. Punjab National Bank was given the responsibility of managing it.

 With almost four months having passed since the minister made the announcement, tea firms have now taken up the matter with the Indian Banks? Association (IBA).

 ?Banks are sceptical about providing funds to tea companies. They want collateral security or government guarantee against the loans. This is delaying the entire process of rejuvenating the industry,? Indian Tea Association chairman C. K. Dhanuka said.

 Nearly 47 per cent of the tea bushes in India are more than 40 years old. Plantations spread on 2,12,000 hectares are in this vulnerable category. Since their yields are extremely low, there is a need for a major effort aimed at re-plantation/rejuvenation over the next 15 years.

 Despite a Tea Board subsidy of 25 per cent on loans taken for replanting bushes, the disbursals have fallen short of the requirement. ?There are a number of factors constraining a tea company from embarking on such developmental activities. These must be addressed if the industry is to raise the replanting/rejuvenation rate,? Dhanuka added.

 The special fund announced by Nath envisages loans at softer rates for development of gardens. 

 The ITA chairman said unless the rejuvenation of tea bushes is carried out, the quality of Indian tea will suffer. ?The industry may lose out to other tea-producing nations like Sri Lanka, Kenya and others,? he added.

 Over the years, a number of factors have been instrumental in pricing Indian tea out of the world market. At the heart of all these problems is the cost of production, which remains highest among all countries.

 The ITA recently undertook an exercise to examine the cost of production. This was based on the detailed information provided by its members.

 The exercise ? reflective of the North Indian cost as a whole ? reveals that the cost of production is touching $1.70 per kg. This compares most unfavourably with countries like Kenya, Bangladesh and Vietnam with costs of $1.16, $0.98 and $0.96 per kg respectively.

 Sebi booster for retail trading 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 12: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) will abolish demat opening and custody charges from January 31 to encourage retail participation in the equity market.

 Sebi chairman G. N. Bajpai announced this at the valedictory function of an international conference on emerging securities market here today. There will not be any charges for the credit in a demat account, Bajpai added.

 The Sebi chief said the regulator is looking at reducing the transaction and maintenance cost of the demat account. This measure would not only encourage small investors to opt for the demat route but it would also attract new players in the capital market, he added.

 The move to abolish demat opening and custody charges comes in response to a long-standing demand to reduce high custody charges and annual maintenance cost on depository accounts.

 The market regulator had appointed several committees to look into the matter and some recommended that companies should share part of the burden as they are the biggest beneficiaries of dematerialisation of equities. It is believed that almost 60-70 per cent investors continue to hold on to their physical shares.

 For the retail investor, the good news came after a gut-wrenching 120-point fall in the sensex on worries about waning inflows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs).

 The Sebi chief, however, clarified that he did not meet any FII over the recent stock market slowdown.

 The bourses ended in a negative zone for the third consecutive session. The fall came despite Infosys Technologies beating street estimates in posting a net profit of over Rs 497 crore for the third quarter ended December 31. The scrip dipped by Rs 67.60 to Rs 1903.35.

 The sensex opened marginally higher on the Infosys numbers at 6250.35 and touched an intra-day high of 6263.71. It hit a low of 6070.33 on mounting FII worries and finally ended the day at 6102.74, a loss of 120.13 points or 1.93 per cent.

 In the past three sessions, the sensex has lost over 317 points.

 Today?s fall not withstanding, some analysts expect a recovery shortly. ?This is the technical bottom. The markets should recover soon,? a broker said.

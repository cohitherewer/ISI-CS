 Nestle lines up share buyback

 Stable outlook

 Vevey, Switzerland, Feb. 24 (Reuters): Nestle set a 1-billion Swiss franc ($858.4 million) share buyback on Thursday after 2004 margins edged up despite high raw material costs and a hit from the weak dollar.

 The world?s biggest food producer said more buybacks could follow its relatively modest program, which will start in the second half of this year, as strong cash flow and its top-notch credit rating allow for greater flexibility in its capital structure. 

 The maker of Nescafe and KitKat chocolate also increased its dividend by 11 per cent to 8 francs per share. 

 Nestle raised its payout to shareholders even as it cut its debt ? Nestle said debt had fallen to 10.2 billion Swiss francs at the end of 2004 from 14.4 billion a year earlier. Chief financial officer Wolfgang Reichenberger said the situation had continued to improve since the year-end. 

 ?If we look at the current environment, net debt is now below 10 billion Swiss francs, it?s somewhere between 5 and 10 (billion),? Reichenberger told a conference call. 

 Chief executive Peter Brabeck said Switzerland?s biggest company by sales expected to keep its ?AAA? credit rating while returning cash to shareholders, which meant that major acquisitions were pretty much ruled out for now. 

 ?We were visiting with all rating institutions before the announcement. We are within the benchmark of the situation. There are certain criteria and Nestle is within those criteria,? Brabeck said. 

 ?I expect that we will receive a stable outlook relatively soon because there is no reason not to have it,? Brabeck added.

 Nestle shares rose as investors welcomed the buyback news. At 5:09 am, they were up 1 per cent at 316.75 francs. 

 The maker of KitKat chocolate and Perrier mineral water reconfirmed its target for core organic growth ? a measure of price and volume increases ? at between 5 and 6 per cent, despite falling short of that level at 4.5 per cent last year. 

 It expected an increase in sales and margin for earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) in constant currencies. 

 ?The share buyback is very positive news. The fact that they are reassessing their capital structure with this initial buyback and especially an indication that more could come is exactly what we wanted from them,? said one Zurich analyst.

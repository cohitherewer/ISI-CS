 AmEx triple benefit card

 american express has introduced a tri-branded credit card in association with ICICI Lombard and Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL).

 With the card, customers will be able to pay their ICICI Lombard motor insurance premium over a period of three, six, nine or 12 months at zero interest. 

 Card members can also take the option to authorise their insurance renewal charge on the card.

 The card offers 5 per cent guaranteed savings on fuel bills. A customer can buy fuel at any of the HPCL outlets without paying the 2.5 per cent service charge levied on other credit cards. Also, the members will get an additional 2.5 per cent saving on their fuel expenses by earning five times membership reward points. These points can be redeemed into fuel vouchers, which can be used to get free fuel.

 Also, the cardholders will be able to save 10 per cent or more on fuel, every time they fill up on the card. 

 One earns 50 per cent more membership reward points by charging their other expenses to the card.

 Card members can choose to issue standing instructions to pay their recurring utility bills on the card for which, over and above 50 per cent addition, they also get 500 bonus points for each sign up.

 The interest rate charged on the card is 2.7 per cent per month. It also offers a pay-at-ease plan by calling the American Express membership help line within 15 days of purchase. The purchase amount will be converted into EMIs at 1.49 per cent interest per month.

 Members can take the balance transfer facility at 1.45 per cent per month for six months. The cards provide a minimum line of credit of Rs 50,000.

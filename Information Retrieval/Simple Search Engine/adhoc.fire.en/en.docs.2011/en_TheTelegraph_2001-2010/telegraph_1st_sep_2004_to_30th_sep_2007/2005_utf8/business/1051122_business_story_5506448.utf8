 Calcutta, Nov. 21: The promoters of Bajaj Allianz General Insurance may infuse fresh equity into the company in the next financial year.

 Bajaj Auto Ltd owns 74 per cent of Bajaj Allianz, while the remaining 26 per cent is held by Allianz AG. The current equity base of the company is Rs 209 crore.

 Chief financial officer S. Sreenivasan said, In the current fiscal, we may not require fresh equity. But we may need fresh capital next fiscal to fund the current business growth.

 It expects to sell 2 million policies this fiscal. 

 In the first six months of the current fiscal, Bajaj Allianz, which enjoys a 24 per cent market share among private insurers, has registered a premium income of Rs 623 crore against Rs 404 crore in the corresponding previous period. It expects a premium income of Rs 1,200 crore this year against Rs 856 crore in 2004-05. 

 The company has tied up with WorldCare Inc to launch Bajaj Allianz e-opinion rider. It will cover the expenses of second opinion e-consultation services for serious illness in India. The e-consultation will be rendered by Americas three well-known medical centres ? Cleveland Clinic, Duke University Health System and Partners HealthCare System. Partners Healthcare includes Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Womens Hospital.

 Policyholders, who have purchased e-opinion riders, will get up to three e-consultations per year. They will have to pay a premium of Rs 525 for one year, Rs 925 for two years and Rs 1,260 for three years.

 However, a person can consult a maximum of six times in a lifetime, said Sreenivasan. The policy also offers accident coverage of Rs 50,000.

 The company is also open to the idea of selling this product on a stand-alone basis. There is no need for customers to become our policyholder to avail this facility, he added.

 The company is aiming to cover 20,000 lives in six months with e-rider. If the e-rider policy becomes a success, the company may come out with a product for overseas medical treatment as well. This will be for high net-worth individuals. There is a demand for this sort of product in India, Sreenivasan said.

 June 24: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) has requested the government to grant it the navratna status to enable it to compete effectively with private operators by acquiring funds faster.

 CMD A. K. Sinha said in New Delhi today that when BSNL was corporatised in October 2000, we were assured operational flexibility similar to navratna companies. While a lot of the flexibility has been accorded, the delay in granting the status officially is affecting our competitiveness.

 BSNL has a net worth of Rs 68,000 crore and annual revenues more than Rs 32,000 crore. Mahanagar Telecom Nigam Limited (MTNL), which operates in Mumbai and Delhi, is already a navratna, even though it is smaller in size and reach.

 The powers delegated by the government to navratna companies allows them to incur fresh expenditure and enter into joint ventures and alliances. The status will also help us realise our overseas plans, said Sinha.

 Meanwhile, the BSNL-MTNL merger has been put on hold due to MTNLs reservations of becoming a subsidiary of the former. Communications minister Dayanidhi Maran had said in February that the department of telecommunications (DoT) was looking into the report submitted by advisers to decide on the synergy pattern between the two PSUs.

 Regarding investment plans, Sinha said the company will pump in Rs 80,000 crore in the next three years, of which Rs 27,000 crore will be invested this year. The funds will be generated internally, besides tapping short-term debts, vendor loans and securitisation.

 CalTel plans to invest Rs 380 crore in the current fiscal to expand its network and launch services in Calcutta.

 Chief general manager S. P. Chakravarty said, Broadband is contributing to the growth in the fixed-line segment. However, we plan to add 6 lakh GSM subscribers this year and will invest Rs 200 crore to expand our capacity to over 900 base stations. We are also working on the enhanced digital interface and will bring in 3G services next year. We will also invest Rs 30 crore to upgrade the CDMA network to provide high-speed Internet access and other value-added services.

 CalTel will invest Rs 65 crore to modernise and upgrade the B-fone network and an estimated Rs 25 crore on broadband services. We plan to launch triple play with audio and video-on-demand, television and Internet on a single cable in the next 5-6 months, said Chakravarty.

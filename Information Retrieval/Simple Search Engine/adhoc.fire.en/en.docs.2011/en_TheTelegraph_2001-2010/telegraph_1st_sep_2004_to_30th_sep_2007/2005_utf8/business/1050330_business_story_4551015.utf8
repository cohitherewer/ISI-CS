 Big leap for small investors

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 29: Leading the charge for small investors, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today made legal amendments that raises the portion of shares reserved for individuals in book-built public offers from 25 per cent to 35 per cent of the issue size. It also redefined a retail investor as someone who applies for shares worth Rs 1 lakh, up from Rs 50,000 so far.

 The amendments were carried out in Section 11(1) of the Sebi Act, which governs the way the book building is done.

 The increase in allocation for small investors meant lesser room for non-institutional investors, who can now buy up to 15 per cent of a flotation, down from 25 per cent.

 The regulator clarified that in book-built issues giving qualified institutional buyers the mandatory 60 per cent allocation, the reservation for retail investors and NIIs would be 30 per cent and 10 per cent respectively. Currently, retail investors get 25 per cent, non-institutions just as much and institutions 50 per cent. 

 The effort to revamp the book-building process also saw the bidding period reduced from 5-10 days (including holidays) to 3-7 days. These can be extended by three days if there is a revision in price band of the offer.

 Firms coming out with the issues can disclose the floor price a day before the bidding kicks off. At present, this has to be done in the prospectus/ application. 

 ?Issuers can either disclose the price band in prospectus/application/abridged prospectus or do so at least one day before the bidding process begins,? Sebi added.

 All the amendments made through the circular ? from the revision in retail allocation to price disclosures ? will apply to offer documents filed after April 4. 

 Stock exchanges have been asked to put in place adequate systems to ensure compliance with amendments and to spread the information among the public.

 The market regulator also issued the notification extending the deadline for implementation of the revised Clause 49 of the listing agreement to December 31.

 The changes come at a time when public issues made through the book-building route have drawn a good response from investors. 

 Many more offers are on the way, some of them as early as April. These include those of Gokaldas Exports, 3i Infotech and Allahabad Bank. The new norms will not cover these since their offer filings have already been made with the market regulator.

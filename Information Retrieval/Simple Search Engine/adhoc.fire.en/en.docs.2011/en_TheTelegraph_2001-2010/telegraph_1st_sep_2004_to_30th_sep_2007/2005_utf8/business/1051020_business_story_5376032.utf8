 Currency cowers, stocks shudder

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 19: Stocks were sucked into the currency cauldron today as the dance of the dollar and a possible twirl of US interest rates scorched Dalal Street. 

 The BSE sensex hurtled below the 8000-mark to close at 7971.06 in a 151-point slide sparked by fears that rupee wobbles ? it tested a new low at 45.42 this afternoon ? were causing a slowdown in foreign fund flows. The prospect of rising US rates was also spooking local markets, which will lose a lot of the money that FIIs will park in more attractive American treasury bonds.

 Hedge funds, driven by short-term considerations, are believed to have been leading the swarm of sellers on bourses, prompting other foreign investors to dump shares to trim losses arising out of adverse rupee-dollar conversions.

 FII sales on Tuesday were at Rs 230 crore in the cash segment; the trend in futures was no different. They have withdrawn over Rs 3300 crore from the futures section and Rs 970 crore from the cash segment this month.

 Its the currency, was the snappy retort of a jumpy fund manager when asked what he thought of the slump. Theres a disconnect between the second-quarter results and the free-fall, he said as rosy corporate scorecards began to be crushed in the market implosion.

 Just how swift the slide has been can be seen in the bone-jarring ride of the sensex, which has shed 828.90 points, over 10 per cent, of its value in the past 10 sessions. 

 Its close to the bottom. The sell-off had to happen as the market had risen too fast, said Arun Kejriwal of KRIS. The volume of business on BSE rose to Rs 3722.47 crore from Rs 2762.48 crore on Tuesday. Reliance, State Bank, ONGC and Bajaj Auto were among the big losers. ICICI Bank and Satyam Computer went against the market tide, finishing with smart gains in the choppy session.

 Shaky rupee

 The rupees plunge to 45.42 came as the dollar marched against key world currencies and the spectre of a rate spike loomed. The Indian unit did recover to 45.17 at close but not before it had already spooked the stock market, where sellers laid siege to the trading floor and share indices tumbled steeper than many had feared.

 The rupee opened shaky at 45.23 against the dollar ? it had settled at 45.17 on Tuesday ? but it soon plumbed a 12-month low in a forex market where ears have been cocked to US rate rumbles and the greenbacks swings abroad.

 What helped the rupee rally was a burst of dollar supplies that arrived with banks and exporters after noon. At its close of 45.17, it was almost unchanged over Tuesdays finish.

 The rupee came under pressure in the early hours of trading. This was on account of the dollars strength against other currencies overseas. However, as it fell to intra-day lows, a lot of dollar supplies flowed in. Some of the other currencies, such as euro, firmed up against the greenback, said a dealer with a leading private sector bank.

 It was not clear if the Reserve Bank of India intervened by asking state-run banks to sell dollars, which analysts say is over-stretched at this exchange rate. 

 The rupee has weakened from 43.50. Though there are concerns of FII outflows, the currency is likely to slide towards the 45-mark. It may settle at 44.90, an analyst said. The factors to watch out for will be the trend in FII outflows, the widening current account deficit and dollars gains against other global currencies.

 Q amp;A

 Home truths

 I am selling my house for Rs 8 lakh. I want to take an advance of Rs 4 lakh from the buyer this year and build another house for myself. The remaining Rs 4 lakh will be paid 4-6 months later and the deed finalised accordingly. Am I eligible to get capital gains tax exemption for construction with advance payment?

 Swapan Ghosh, Calcutta

 The date of registration or transfer of property is instrumental in claiming capital gains tax exemption. Thus, one can claim such an exemption for the year in which such a transfer has been made. If your sale deed and registration is finalised next year, you shall be able to claim the exemption next year.

 Part and whole

 I pay Rs 23,640 per annum towards principal amount of house building advance, of which Rs 20,000 is being allowed by my employer for tax saving purpose. Is the whole amount deductible from total income for the current financial year? 

 Amit Kumar Das, Calcutta

 According to the budget proposals for the current financial year 2005-06 (assessment year 2006-07), repayment of housing loan up to Rs 1 lakh is to be deducted from total income under section 80C. According to the proposal, total of Rs 23,640 should be now deducted from your income instead of the earlier limit of Rs 20,000. However, the change would be brought about after the finance bill is passed in Parliament.

 Saving grace

 I am a working lady. I had invested Rs 10,000 in the National Savings Scheme (1987) in 1992 and wish to withdraw the maturity amount now. Shall the amount be subject to tax and under which head shall I mention it?

 Sanchita Chatterjee, Calcutta

 Withdrawal from National Savings Scheme (1987) is subject to tax deducted at source at the rate of 20 per cent above Rs 2,500. However, to claim nil or lower deduction, you can submit a written declaration in Form 15G or 15H, as applicable.

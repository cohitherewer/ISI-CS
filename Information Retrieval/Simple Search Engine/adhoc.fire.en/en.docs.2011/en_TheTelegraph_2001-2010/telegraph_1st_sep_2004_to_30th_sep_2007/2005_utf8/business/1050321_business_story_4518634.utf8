 Airports groan under traffic

 Mumbai, March 20: The ground infrastructure available at the country?s premier airports cannot cope with the new open-skies policy of the government. The air-traffic congestion over airports is turning into a nightmare for several airlines, even as many of them are in queue for an entry with hubs in Mumbai and Delhi ? the most lucrative sectors.

 Airlines are being nudged to park their aircraft in Ahmedabad, Vadodhra and Pune in the night and start their morning flights from smaller cities as the airport in Mumbai is choc-a-bloc. Airlines officials say parking aircraft in smaller cities may not be commercially feasible.

 The take-off and landing facility as well as parking bays available at airports cannot keep with the growing air-traffic. ?We built the Taj Mahal 400 years ago, which is unsurpassed. Why can?t we build a world class airport,? said Captain G. R. Gopinath, managing director of Air Deccan.

 Gopinath, however, considers himself lucky as he has been allotted two more parking bays in Mumbai, which he would get by August. 

 ?We are increasing the availability of space at the Mumbai airport. However, there is a genuine limitation,? says Sudhir Kumar, director of Airports Authority of India.

 Kumar said there is space for only 75 parking bays. AAI is increasing the space for 30 more, which are in different stages of completion. The international airport in Mumbai has a different set of parking bays.

 Regional airlines have to consider other airports for parking during the night, he added.

 In Mumbai alone, the number of aircraft movements is 25 per hour (landing and take-off) and a day?s average is pegged at a little over 500 movements. 

 As a result, aeroplanes queue up for more than 10-15 minutes for take-off and landing, before they get a clear signal, airlines sources said.

 According to Gopinath, with the existing facility, the airports can double from 25 to 50 movements per hour. 

 ?One should have a passion and a belief that one can earn more revenue by optimally using the landing and take-off facilities.? 

 It can be done in Mumbai as it has two runways. 

 However, airlines officials say Mumbai Airport has a strange peculiarity. 

 There are two runways with an intersection, making it difficult to operate at the same time.

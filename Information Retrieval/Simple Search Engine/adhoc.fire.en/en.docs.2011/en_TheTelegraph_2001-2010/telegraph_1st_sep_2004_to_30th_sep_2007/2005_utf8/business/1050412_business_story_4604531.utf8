 Airlines carve no-poaching corridor

 New Delhi, April 11: Hit by a severe shortage of pilots and aircraft engineers, airlines have been asked to work out a ?no-poaching pact? among themselves within a week.

 New start-up airlines as well as existing private carriers were on a poaching spree, picking up pilots and aircraft engineers from state-run Indian Airlines as well as from each other.

 ?I am calling for a consensus on self-regulation ... the current trend has, on occasion, affected flight schedules,? said civil aviation minister Praful Patel, who had called a meeting of rival airlines.

 ?The poaching is driving up wages and unsettling the airline sector ... we, consequently, asked all airline CEOs to get together to work out a consensus on guidelines, which would make it difficult to poach from each other ... normal movements will, however, continue,? senior civil aviation officials added. 

 Besides state-run Indian Airlines and Air-India, Sahara, Jet, Air Deccan, Kingfisher and Spice Airlines were present at the meeting. 

 Sahara Airlines president and CEO Rono Dutta said, ?We would like to bring in a system whereby a notice period is required.? He also wanted a system under which airlines would commit themselves to approach only a certain percentage of another airline?s staff with job offers. 

 Last month, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation had raised the retirement age for pilots by one year because of the shortage.

 ?A surge in aviation growth in the Asia-Pacific region quickly absorbs whatever supply there is. Foremost among industry?s concerns is the issue of human resources,? said aviation analyst Kapil Kaul.

 Industry studies indicate that there is likely to be a huge skill shortage, especially flight crew and maintenance engineers, in the coming years. The growth surge coincides with an ageing industry population, where the average age of licensed aircraft engineers is in the mid-fifties, while that of professional pilots is in the late-forties. 

 Significantly, just as many of these skilled professionals approach retirement, most industry sectors are under strict cost constraints. As a consequence, the intake of apprentices by airlines has fallen to an all-time low. 

 A report released by the Australia-based Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation indicates that, even on conservative estimates, an additional 94,000 skilled staff will be needed in the Asia-Pacific region over the next decade, greatly exceeding the projected supply.

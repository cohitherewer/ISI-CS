 Calcutta, March 26: Century Plyboards (I) Ltd has placed a proposal before the Bengal government for taking up timber plantation in the Sunderbans.

 Sanjay Agarwal, deputy managing director of the company, said the company plans to undertake timber plantation in 3,000 hectares in the Sunderbans.

 At present, the company imports almost its entire requirement of 3,000 cubic meters from Myanmar and Malaysia. This costs the company Rs 3.5 crore. 

 According to Agarwal, if Century is allowed to enter timber plantation, it will help the company to cut down raw material costs.

 The backward integration will help the company ward off input cost pressure while securing steady supply.

 During the current financial year, Century is likely to post a turnover of Rs 165 crore compared with Rs 132 crore in the previous financial year.

 ?We are targeting Rs 250-crore turnover in the next fiscal. Net profit will also rise to Rs 14 crore from Rs 9 crore this year,? he added.

Plant inauguration 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today inaugurated the company?s pre-laminated plant, which will manufacture 30,000 particle boards per month. The minister lauded the healthy relation between the management and the workers of the plant.

 ?We want more job creation in the state. To achieve that, the management and workers should work together. We want more capital. We welcome foreign direct investment for further job creation,? he added.

 The plant had been set up at an investment of Rs 35 crore.

 FM hits bank-revamp note

 Winds of change

 Mumbai, April 8: The Centre is willing to give banks more autonomy and will not stall the process of their consolidation.

 The indication came from finance minister P. Chidambaram, who said the public-sector character of state-owned banks will be retained after consolidation or merger.

 Inaugurating the new centre of Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi) as part of his visit to the country?s commercial capital today, the finance minister reiterated that there would be no retrenchment of employees during consolidation. Instead, he said, staff will be ?suitably re-deployed in the merged entity?.

 Observers say the assurance on keeping the PSU attribute intact could have been prompted by Chidambaram?s desire to stay on the right side of the line drawn by the Left parties, which oppose stake cuts in banks.

 ?We will not allow any closure of branches in the event of consolidation. On the contrary, more would be opened,? said the minister, adding branches too close to remain viable within an area might have to be shut down.

 The minister?s comments come against the backdrop of a move, initiated last year, to merge Union Bank of India into Bank of India. He also dangled the carrot of more autonomy but asked banks to improve efficiency too.

 In February, the finance ministry cleared an autonomy package for public sector banks that aimed to create a level-playing field for private and foreign banks. Nationalised banks, too, were given a free hand on hiring policies, branch closures and in opening offices abroad. The board of stronger banks were given the additional freedom of drawing up differential pay structures.

 However, Chidambaram expressed his unhappiness at the tardy credit flow to small and medium enterprises. He said the government would soon set a target for the segment, similar to the one that governs farm loans.

 ?Small-scale units are not a dying sector. Their number has grown, as have their turnover, export and employment. But the credit flow to them has actually declined,? Chidambaram said. He had chosen the occasion well, because Sidbi mostly funds small enterprises.

 In a veiled criticism of the institution, he said its outstanding credit has grown to Rs 11,000 crore in 2004-05 from Rs 5,000 crore in 1991-92 ? a ?sedate? pace of growth.

 More important, of the Rs 11,000 crore disbursed, close to Rs 5,000 crore was in the form of an advance to state finance corporations, most of which are financially weak. A sum of Rs 2,800 crore was refinance to a commercial bank, while Rs 3,000 crore was through direct loans.

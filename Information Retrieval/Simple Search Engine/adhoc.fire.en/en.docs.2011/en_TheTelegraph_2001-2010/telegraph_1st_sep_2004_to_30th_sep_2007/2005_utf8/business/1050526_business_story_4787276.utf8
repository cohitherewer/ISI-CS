 Purchase policy offers a mixed bag 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 25: The government has favoured a three-year extension of the price preference policy for state-run enterprises, even as it has decided to put a cap on the value of tenders where PSUs can avail of a purchase preference. The cap will be Rs 100 crore, sources said.

 A group of ministers, who met here today, decided on the modalities, officials said. This will now be taken up by the cabinet for a final decision.

 The ministries had conflicting views with some suggesting that certain sectors be kept out of it. As the power ministry was opposing the extension of policy in its present form, the compromise reached at the meeting ensured that the 10 per cent price preference for state-run entities on tenders floated by other PSUs stayed.

 The policy provides that when the price quoted by a public sector enterprise is within 10 per cent of the lowest valid bid (L1) in a tender, other things being equal, purchase preference has to be given to the public sector company at the L1 rates. The 10 per cent purchase preference is applicable to all tenders involving contracts of Rs 5 crore and above. 

 Apart from public sector undertakings, joint-venture firms where the government holding is at least 51 per cent or which are subsidiaries of central public sector enterprises with the latter holding a minimum of 51 per cent stake will also be eligible for purchase preference under this scheme.

 The scheme had expired on March 31, 2005 after the last extension in October 2004.

 The underlying objective of this policy is to help public sector units adjust to the new competitive market environment and better utilise their installed capacities.

 VW still on course: Andhra

 - Birth 

 pangs for one, newborn for the other 

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, July 6: The Andhra Pradesh government is confident the Volkswagen project will get off the ground within a month or two. 

 The shadow of the scandal that now looms on the German carmaker will not affect the venture, in which Volkswagen will hold 51 per cent, while the state could pick up a small slice of equity.

 ?We still expect a decision. The scam will delay, not stall the project,? said a spokesman of the state industry department. 

 It now appears that the Andhra government committed $6.6 million without even signing an understanding with Volkswagen. The saving grace was that the investment was made in the form of land that was allotted to the German company to secure the deal.

 The spokesman said the payoff storm at Volkswagen would blow over soon and that a decision on the India plant would be ?announced in a month or two?. 

 ?I had a word with their officials in Delhi and Germany on Monday. We can expect things to roll by September or October,? he added.

 He slammed reports suggesting bribes had been paid to bag the deal. ?Since there is no manufacturing in India, there was no scope for any bribes. The issue of funds mismanagement is limited to a trust run by Volkswagen. Besides, they are talking of a scam in Angola.?

 In January this year, the state government issued orders that enabled Andhra Pradesh Industrial Investment Corporation to pick up a stake worth $6.6 million in the venture, in exchange for the land sanctioned to Volkswagen in the eastern port city of Vishakapatnam.

 Helmuth Schuster, the scandal-singed VW executive who steered the India plan, wrote on January 7 that his company would hold at least 51 per cent in the plant. The letter was addressed to the state government, which was offered a ?nominal stake?. ?The project shall be implemented immediately,? he wrote to the Andhra authorities. 

 The government spokesman said Schuster had visited the state six times along with several colleagues. During his last visit in May, he had assured the Andhra government of his company?s interest in the plant, saying board clearance was little more ?than a formality?.

 However, his departure came much later, at Volkswagen?s June 20 board meeting, where the final decision on the Vishakapatnam plant was delayed further.

 Opposition parties have slammed the Congress government in Andhra over the way it handled the Volkswagen deal. TDP president N. Chandrababu Naidu said the Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy regime was taking advantage of the efforts made when his government was in power.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 McNally thinks big

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Aug. 22: McNally Bharat Engineering Co Ltd, a joint venture company between BM Khaitan group and CK Birla group, has set a target to quadruple its business by foraying into turnkey projects in the ferrous and the non-ferrous sectors.

 Riding piggyback on the massive investments planned by the domestic and multinational steel and aluminium companies in India, McNally Bharat hopes to log over Rs 1,000 crore in turnover 2-3 years hence. At present, it has a turnover of Rs 280 crore, 

 Instead of working in pockets, the company is transforming itself as a lump sum turnkey (LSTK) contractor so that it can bid for an project in its entirety. The company will undertake the development of the whole project through a consortium with overseas companies. 

 McNally Bharat managing director, Srinivas Singh, said the company has tied up with Alcan and a German company GEA for turnkey projects in aluminium and other non-ferrous metals like Zinc and lead.

 We have also tied up with NKMZ Ukraine for steel projects and are also negotiating with a Russian company, Singh added.

 In fact, McNally Bharat is looking for more such partnerships in the future to consolidate its presence in the lump sum turnkey business.

 So far, it has been working in the areas of bulk material handling, port handling, mineral and coal benefaction and water transportation and management. But, the businesses in these sectors are not showing rapid growth of late.

 McNally Bharat is also planning to clean up its balance sheet.

 It has recently raised $7 million through foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) to meet immediate capital requirements. After the conversion of the FCCBs into equity shares, the companys capital base will go up to about Rs 55 crore from Rs 20 crore at present. Singh said the management was considering a further expansion of the companys equity capital to Rs 100 crore.

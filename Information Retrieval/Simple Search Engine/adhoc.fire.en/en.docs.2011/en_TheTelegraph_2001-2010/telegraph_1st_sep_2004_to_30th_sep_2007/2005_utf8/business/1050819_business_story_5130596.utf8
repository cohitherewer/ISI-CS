 Pension gridlock persists

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 18: The cabinet committee on economic affairs today debated a report recommending drastic changes to the pension regulatory bill, which envisages a regulator in a sector open to private fund managers. 

 However, the talks did not lead to a way forward because of the dissent notes filed by the Left parties to the report, drawn up by a standing committee of Parliament. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram did not say a decision has been deferred. He only revealed that discussions were held and that amendments to the bill would be finalised later. 

 Sources say the government wants a political consensus before drafting the amendments. 

 The Left had attacked the bill on a number of grounds. In their dissent notes, CPM and CPI members of the standing committee have expressed fears that by allowing pension contributions to be parked in the stock market, the collective savings could be frittered away. 

 The Left has argued the new Indian pension model is derived from an earlier Chilean system under which fund managers found it difficult to repay even the principal.

 The real bone of contention, however, is foreign direct investment (FDI). 

 The Left feels that overseas pension funds would siphon off savings from local arms to offshore units, unless adequate safeguards are built in. The parties also resent the way powers to legislate on policy issues are sought to be transferred to the regulator.

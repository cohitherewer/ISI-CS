The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Nasscom focus on BPO staff data base

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: The National Association of Software and Services Company (Nasscom) will formally sign up with an agency tomorrow to kickstart its ambitious plan of preparing a national database of the employees of the business process outsourcing (BPO) industry. 

 We have already identified the agency, which will conduct the exercise for us, and the pilot project will be rolled out in three months. It will be a multi-city project and companies of various sizes will be sampled, Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said.

 The apex body of IT and IT-enabled services companies organised two events ? an industry academia interaction to address the issue of human resource constraint facing the knowledge economy and a seminar on the shifting from business process outsourcing (BPO) to knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) ? in the city today. 

 Karnik, however, declined to divulge further details about the project. A national database of the employees of BPO companies is perceived to safeguard the employers against frauds with regard to educational and professional qualifications of potential employees. We will sign a memorandum of understanding with the agency tomorrow, Karnik added.

 According to him, availability of quality human resources is one of the biggest challenges facing the industry and hence actions should be initiated to meet the human resource demand of the growing IT and IT-enabled services (ITES) industry. At present, the selection rates ? eight or nine out of 100 screened actually get picked up by the companies ? in the industry are very low, which will have an impact on the industrys future, Karnik said. 

 Indias export revenues from IT and IT-enabled services is expected to touch $22.3 billion in the current financial year, which is a growth of over 30 per cent over the last fiscal. Karnik said the rule-based BPO functions would slowly be replaced by analytical and skill-specific KPO and the demand for quality manpower would become more important in the coming days. 

 Opportunities in engineering services would be more in the coming days ? Nasscom has estimated that the market for Indian companies could be as big as $12 billion.

 During the interaction with the faculties from 13 colleges, the issue of employability of students was raised. The faculties were really receptive to our suggestions to tackle the problem in the short run, Karnik said. 

 The seminar was conducted in co-operation with ITC Infotech and the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE). 

 The target in the medium term would be to change the curriculum to suit the needs of the employers, Karnik said.

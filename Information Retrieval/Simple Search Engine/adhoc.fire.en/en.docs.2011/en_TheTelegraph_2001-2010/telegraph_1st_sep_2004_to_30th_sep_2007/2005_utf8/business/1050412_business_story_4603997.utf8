 Trai clears air on collection of rural levy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Collect call

 New Delhi, April 11: Telecom operators, on whose network a roaming subscriber logs in, will be responsible for collecting the access deficit charge (ADC) and pay it to Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL).

 All calls from the national roaming subscribers will be treated as long distance calls.

 Moreover, all calls from international roaming subscribers will be treated as incoming international calls while calculating the ADC.

 The ADC is paid by operators to fund those offering telecom service in rural and inaccessible areas at a higher infrastructure cost. Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) is the major beneficiary as it has set up a majority of telephones in the rural areas.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) in a directive today defined all calls from roaming subscribers as long distance ones and those from international roaming subscribers as incoming international calls for ADC purposes.

 According to Trai, roaming means the ability of a cellular subscriber to automatically make and receive voice calls and access data and other services while travelling outside the geographical coverage area of the home network, by using the visited network.

 ?It is national roaming when the visited and home networks of the subscriber are in the same country and international roaming when visited and home networks of the subscriber are in different countries,? an official statement said. 

 The ADC for national long distance calls will be applicable at the rate of 30 paise per minute. An ADC of Rs 3.25 per minute will be applicable for international roaming subscribers while making any calls from India.

 Cellular operators may challenge the Trai order, saying the telecom regulator has manipulated the definition of such calls to ensure the applicability of ADC.

 ?This is pure manipulation. They (Trai) have changed the definition of international and national calls just to make ADC applicable. This is incorrect action and against consumers. This will have to be loaded against the consumers to recover the cost, which we do not want. We are in consultation with our members to take the next course of action. This may be challenged,? T. V. Ramachandran, DG, Cellular Operatrors Association of India (COAI), said.

 Fringe tax tweak fails to lift spirits

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 2: India Inc intends to press for another review of the fringe benefit tax ? and has found little merit in the way Chidambaram and his tax mandarins in the finance ministry have rejigged the rates today.

 The biggest disappointment is that the fringe benefit tax rate stays at 30 per cent.

 According to corporate honchos, Asean nations do not have fringe benefit tax and India ought to stay in lockstep with the regional trading forum with which it wants to establish close trade links.

 ?An adjustment in corporate tax rates would have been a much simple solution than complex FBT provisions, said Rahul Garg, executive director of PricewaterhouseCoopers.

 The chambers, however, welcomed the amendments like exemption of saving accounts from banking cash transaction tax and raising income tax exemption limits for women and senior citizens. 

 Assocham president Mahendra Sanghi said the ceiling for exemption of withdrawal by companies should be raised to Rs 2 lakh from Rs 1 lakh prescribed in the budget.

 Companies were pleased to hear that the 30 per cent fringe benefit tax had been waived on sales promotion and publicity ? a proviso that had caused a lot of consternation when Chidambaram announced it in his budget.

 Salil Kapoor, head (marketing) of LG Electronics, said: ?We are happy that the government has exempted companies from paying the tax on sales promotion exercises.?

 Considering the wider implications for the hotel industry, the sector was quite unhappy.

 Tarun Thukral, general manager of Le Meridien hotel, said: ?The imposition of the fringe benefit tax on tour, travel and conferences organised by companies will affect revenues that hoteliers earn from these activities. They form a substantial part of our revenues. This should be scrapped.?

 Life insurance companies also fretted and fumed over the decision to slap FBT on the contributions that companies make to superannuation funds of their employees.

 N. N. Joshi, chief representative of ING Vysya Life Insurance, said, ?Taxing contribution to superannuation funds will impinge on the growth of the life insurance business.?

 Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, CMD of Biocon India, said, ?It seems that all the concessions that the finance minister gave during the budget will be taken back by way of FBT.?

 Ramesh Jain, CEO of Eicher Tractors, said: ?Any conveyance, travel and expense on conferences incurred with respect to official work should not be taxed at all.?

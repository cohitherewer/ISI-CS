 Mukesh muffles IPCL merger buzz

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mukesh: Taking his time

 Mumbai, June 27: Mukesh Ambani today ruled out the immediate merger of Indian Petrochemicals Corporation (IPCL) with Reliance Industries (RIL) even as he announced a Rs 485-crore investment in seven expansion programmes at the one-time state-owned firm.

 In his first appearance before shareholders at IPCLs 36th annual general meeting in Vadodara since resolving the ownership dispute with brother Anil, Ambani said: There is no plan to merge IPCL with Reliance Industries. Its board can take a decision later on.

 The IPCL chairman was responding to queries from shareholders who wanted to know whether a merger was planned. Speculation about it has been rife for the past several months but it intensified recently when the three-year agreement of shareholders with the government lapsed on June 4. This meant that a merger could be pushed ahead without obtaining government approval.

 The talk of the link-up set the IPCL share on fire. It hit an intra-day high of Rs 189.75 after opening at Rs 169.90 but recoiled when Ambani said the two firms would stay separate for now. The stock ended at Rs 176.85.

 Reliance Industries snapped up IPCL in 2002, purchasing 26 per cent of its equity from the government for Rs 1,491 crore. It later came out with an open offer that raised its stake by another 20 per cent. While the government later announced a public offer for the 34 per cent residual stake it held in the company, RIL did not buy fresh shares. Promoters now own 46 per cent. Elaborating on investment plans in his address to the shareholders, Mukesh revealed that IPCL has taken up seven expansion programmes. These projects, he said, would require an investment of Rs 485 crore and are expected to be completed by the middle of next year.

 As part of the ramp-up, the Vadodara cracker unit will produce an additional 12,000 tonnes of ethylene every year; benzene and PVC production will also go up. The Gandhar gas cracker will churn out 65,000 tonnes more of ethylene and an extra 6,000 tonnes of polybutadiene rubber. The dry spun acrylic fibre plant will be in a position to raise output by 6,000 tonnes annually. For the future, Mukesh said he will concentrate on productivity to achieve greater competitiveness and one of the ways to do it would be to procure low-cost feedstock.

 Ambani cautioned that IPCL would have to contend with the volatile feedstock and energy costs that are typical to the petrochemicals industry. These put pressure on pricing and margins in the value chain. 

 IPCL would have to factor in an increase in domestic gas prices. Thus, managing feedstock costs, maintaining flexibility in its use and addressing energy cost volatility would be the imperatives for success, he said.

 When shareholders raised a demand for higher dividends, Mukesh asked them to have patience and watch the performance, though the annual general meeting today did clear a previously announced payout of 45 per cent.

 Calcutta, Aug. 25: Hewlett-Packard India (H-P) plans to introduce desktop computers priced below Rs 20,000 within the next three months.

 ?The demand for sub-10,000 PCs is limited. The models we plan to launch will cater to the needs of the home user and have a fair amount of disk space. The PCs will have the option of Linux or Windows as the operating system, and at least one model will have an Intel processor,? HP India general manager (consumer sales) V. Krishnan said.

 The PCs will be made at the company?s Bangalore unit.

 Krishnan said the demand for PCs priced around Rs 15,000 was mainly from the small and medium business (SMB) segment. Home users preferred PCs in the Rs 20,000-30,000 range, he added.

 The company also plans to offer an economic package comprising desktop, printer, scanner and copier and other accessories.

 HP will focus on the retail segment and will set up 50 premium outlets to showcase its entire range of computing products. Currently, the company has eight Experience Zones in major locations, including Calcutta.

 ?Thirty-five per cent of our total sales are made through retail channels,? said Krishnan. ?With the retail sector going through an upswing, we are betting on sales through this channel to grow further.?

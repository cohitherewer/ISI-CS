 PSUs to get more powers

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Dev: Determined

 Hyderabad, June 11: The government would give more powers to public sector undertakings (PSUs) to take corporate decisions, Union minister of state for heavy industries and public enterprises Santosh Mohan Dev said here today. 

 A comprehensive package involving joint ventures, writing off liabilities and sale of surplus land is being worked out to revive sick PSUs, the minister said.

 Dev, who visited the Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel) plant here, said the government?s holding after disinvestment in Bhel would be in excess of 57 per cent and it would continue to be a government-owned company. ?This will have no impact at any level on the functioning of Bhel,? he said.

 ?It has been decided to reserve 15 per cent of the proposed disinvestment for Bhel employees to create a feel of ownership,? he added. 

 On sick PSUs in Andhra Pradesh that are under his ministry, Dev said the matter had been discussed with chief minister Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy. ?Three companies came forward to take over the sick cement unit in Adilabad which is under examination,? Dev said.

 Dev urged Reddy to waive dues of public sector units like Hindustan Cable and Bharat Heavy Plates and Explosives. ??such concessions will help revive these units,? he said. 

 The chief minister has offered to consider the Union government?s plea positively. 

 He said disinvestment proposals were not aimed at marring the reputation of navratnas. ?We will ensure that the image of PSUs is not tarnished,? he said. 

 The Union minister said sick PSUs should be allowed to raise resources by selling excess land. ?We have tried it in IISCO and HMT.?

 He urged state governments to provide concurrence for disposing PSU land.

 Voicing his dissent over the proposed move to integrate Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd with Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL), Dev said, ?It should not be merged but allowed to operate independently as it has already turned around and giving good dividends.?

 A decision would be taken within a couple of months, he added.

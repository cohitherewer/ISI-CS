 Merger of IISCO by December

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Almost there

 New Delhi, March 24: The merger of Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO) with SAIL will be completed by December. 

 Replying to queries from CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta in Parliament today, steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan said the proposal came to him in October. ?I have looked into it and will send the proposal to the cabinet in three months. We will be able to complete the merger within six months of the Cabinet nod or December.?

 According to the minister, what helped clinch the issue was the improvement in SAIL?s finances, particularly its high profits. ?We found the proposal acceptable. I spoke to Bengal chief minister and the SAIL chairman. It hardly took any time to decide the issue.?

 The steel ministry feels the best chance of reviving IISCO, which was made a subsidiary of SAIL soon after it was nationalised in the early 1970s, lies in a merger with its parent.

 Top steel ministry officials said IISCO, which has itself started making profits and was turning into an ?an asset for the parent?, owns Chiria mines, whose massive iron ore reserves could feed SAIL?s future growth. 

 The Burnpur-based steel maker reported a net profit of Rs 27 crore in 2003-04, its first since 1974-75. It slipped into the red within three years of the Union government taking it over from the Calcutta-based Mukherjee family.

 The 125-year-old firm with a turnover of Rs 1051 crore in the last financial year is saddled with accumulated losses of Rs 550 crore. In November 2003, the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction cleared a Rs 881-crore package to revive the firm. This followed the central government?s clearance to the scheme.

 The bulk of the money meant to resuscitate IISCO ? about Rs 540 crore ? is being spent on a VRS scheme. 

 SAIL, which owns a majority stake in the firm, plans to increase the annual output at the Burnpur unit from 3 lakh tonnes to 5.4 lakh tonnes by spending Rs 230 crore on a sinter plant, two blast furnaces and a wire and rod mill.

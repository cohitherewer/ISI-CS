 Job-shift buzz at Orange

 DOMINIC WHITE

 Trial run

 London, Jan. 10: Orange, Britain?s largest mobile phone operator, plans to outsource 1,500 jobs ? 12 per cent of its UK workforce ? to India, as part of a drive by its parent, France Telecom, to cut costs.

 The mobile company is beginning trials with two specialist sub-contractors, Convergys and Vertex, in which 215 call-centre workers in Delhi will answer customer service inquiries during peak periods.

 It is believed that if the trials are successful, Orange plans to stop replacing leavers at its six UK call-centres until 1,500 have left. Annual staff turnover is running at almost 30 per cent.

 An Orange spokesman said: ?A final figure on the number of roles we intend to outsource will not be decided until these trials are complete. The steps we are taking will not lead to site closures and redundancies.

 ?Customer service is a priority for Orange and this outsourcing is intended to help Orange Customer Services cope with high demand and ensure the company continues to offer customer the high level of service they have come to expect over the last 10 years.?

 Call-centre staff make up half of Orange UK?s 12,000-strong workforce, with the lion?s share working in Darlington, Peterlee and North Tyneside.

 The group is also making 200 staff redundant from the technical department at its Bristol headquarters, where it has offered some information technology staff one-year salary deals.

 Orange joins the caravan of big companies on a passage to India, where wages are a fraction of those in the UK for young, well-educated, English speakers.

 According to the Communication Worker?s Union, 33 large companies ? including Barclays, British Airways, LloydsTSB, Prudential, and Reuters ? have collectively outsourced 52,000 jobs serving UK customers.

 The Confederation of British Industry recently warned there would be no jobs for unskilled workers in Britain in 10 years because of outsourcing, while Amicus has predicted that 200,000 jobs could be lost to offshore outsourcing by 2010.

 Orange UK?s plans could cause further bitterness towards France Telecom, which some insiders say considers its UK operations a soft target for job losses because the British unions are less powerful than those in France.

 However, a leaked letter from the new chief executive of France Telecom?s troubled subsidiary, Equant, also suggests that its 9,500 staff could be in for a difficult time. Charles Dehelly, who was appointed on Boxing Day, wrote to his staff last week warning that the company needed to ?stop the cash bleeding by drastically reducing our costs?.

 ?Although final figures are not yet available, we know 2004 was a very bad year,? Dehelly wrote. ?We were unable to deliver our 2004 initial budget, our revenue is down and we significantly increased our losses. 

 More important, we burnt a large amount of cash and the Equant stock price has dropped by 48 per cent since January 2004.?

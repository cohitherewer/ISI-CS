 Calcutta, Oct. 14: Picture this. You buy a handset for Rs 2,499 and receive unlimited calls on it for two years at no extra cost. To make calls, just buy some vouchers that promise 100 per cent talktime. 

 Sounds unreal? Tata Teleservices plans to do with its ?nonstop mobile? offer what Reliance Infocomm did with its Monsoon Hungama ? raise subscriber base. The company has set its sights on a 10-million subscriber base by the end of this fiscal. It now has 2.4 million users.

 The Tata Indicom Non Stop Mobile service is a pre-paid plan with a validity period of two years on purchase of a handset from the company. There is no fixed monthly commitment and subscribers can recharge with vouchers of any denominations and use it for the entire validity period.

 The customers can extend the offer after the initial period is over by purchasing another two-year voucher. Such vouchers will be made available within 35-40 days, he added.

 He said the company would soon launch a scheme for existing pre-paid customers too.

 ?We are one of the fastest-growing prepaid service providers in the country. With this new plan, we can achieve higher mobile penetration and contribute to the telecom minister?s target of achieving a 250-million subscriber base by 2008,? said Rajesh Puri, chief operating officer of Tata Teleservices (east).

 According to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), the total mobile subscriber base in the country is 65.05 million. The mobile penetration is around 10 per cent of the population. Ideally, this should be around 25-30 per cent, said Puri.

 He said over 80 per cent of the mobile subscribers in the country are pre-paid and this segment presents the highest growth segment as most of the customers are value conscious and keen to limit their telephone costs.

 Tata Teleservices has a subscriber base of 5.6 million, including 2.4 million mobile and 3.2 million fixed wireless subscribers. ?Of this, 20 per cent of the mobile and 50 per cent of the fixed wireless are postpaid customers,? he said.

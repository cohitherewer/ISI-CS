The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Q amp;A

 Set standards

 I am 63 years old and retired. I have an annual interest income of Rs 68,736 from post office MIS and LIC annuity of Rs 26,112. Apart from standard deduction, what other exemptions can I claim? 

 Swapan Kumar Ghosh, Calcutta

 ce your total income is within the exempted limit of Rs1 lakh, you will not be required to pay any tax on the amount. 

 Now and then

 My salary income is Rs 1,80,000 and taxable income is Rs 1,33,600. Shall my income tax be computed after deducting an exemption of Rs 1,11,500 as was provided for the assessment year 2005-06 (financial year 2004-05)? 

 Santanu Mondal, by e-mail

 No, according to the tax provisions, anyone with a taxable income up to Rs 1,11,500 shall be exempted from paying tax. However, since your income is beyond that limit, you will have to compute tax according to the original procedure.

 Joint venture

 We have invested Rs 6 lakh in a joint account of post office monthly income scheme. Can we invest an additional Rs 6 lakh in another joint account?

 Jagdish Halder, Calcutta

 No, the investment limit on post office MIS joint account is Rs 6 lakh.

 Pension position

 Is pension received from Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana shown under the head of salary or income from other sources? 

 Deepak Bahatia, by e-mail

 The pension received from the scheme is shown under the head of income from other sources and is fully taxable at your marginal tax rate.

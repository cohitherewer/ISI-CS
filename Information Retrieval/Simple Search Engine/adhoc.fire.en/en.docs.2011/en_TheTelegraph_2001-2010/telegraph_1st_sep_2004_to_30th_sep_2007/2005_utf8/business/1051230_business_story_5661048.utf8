 Move to win Left nod for limited divestment 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 29: Finance minister P Chidambaram is persuading Left allies to accept the UPA governments proposal for divestment in profitable public-sector undertakings outside the navaratna fold.

 Chidambaram met CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and his CPI counterpart A.B. Bardhan in separate meetings last evening to sound them on the plan. Both said they would offer the Centre alternative proposals. The Left partners will hold a meeting on Monday.

 The finance minister wants a 15 per cent sale of shares in four PSUs, including Power Finance Corporation and Hudco. The selloff will leave the government, which now owns all of the two companies, with 85 per cent. The Left leaders are far from convinced.

 There is a perception within the Left Front that the CPM is in a compromising mood on divestment or the pension bill. Those who believe this say the party is being guided by the economic interests of the Bengal government. It also partly explains why Karat is backing chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to the hilt. 

 On divestment of non-navaratna profitable PSUs, the Left would like the government to tap alternative sources of fund mobilisation. The government says it will be a one-time divestment. But what is the guarantee that this will not become a habit? asks Bardhan.

 The Left submitted 12 alternative proposals to the finance minister before he presented the budget. We will expand these plans and send them again, added Bardhan.

 There is, however, a qualitative difference in the Lefts stand on reforms earlier and at present. In the past, it would not even hear of divestment in profit-making PSUs; now, it is willing to consider the proposal, though unions affiliated to these parties are against it.

 The Left will not mind supporting the pension regulatory bill, if unions agree. The CPM has even suggested amendments that could make the bill more acceptable to the party. While the deadlock on the bill persists, the finance minister has indicated to the CPI that CPM, the main Left Front constituent, is willing to go with the draft.

 Among the amendments CPM has proposed is a plan to hand over management of the fund to a PSU and a bar on investing money in stocks. The government is ready to accept the first, but only as a temporary measure. Once the fund swells, a private agency would have to manage it.

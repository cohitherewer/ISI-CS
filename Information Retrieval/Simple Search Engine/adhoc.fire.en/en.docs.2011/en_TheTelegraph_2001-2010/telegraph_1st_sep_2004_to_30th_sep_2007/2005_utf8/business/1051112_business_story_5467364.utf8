 SpiceJet off Temasek radar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 11: Singapore governments investment arm, Temasek Holdings Ltd, will not pick up a stake in SpiceJet, despite an earlier announcement to this effect made by the Indian carrier.

 SpiceJet officials clarified that the aviation investment rules, which debar foreign firms having holdings in airlines and airports from investing in airlines in India, could be the reason for the decision. 

 Temasek has holdings in Singapore Airport. 

 The rules were framed during the previous NDA governments rule.

 Current FDI rules permit 49 per cent foreign investment in domestic airlines, but foreign airlines are not permitted to invest directly or indirectly.

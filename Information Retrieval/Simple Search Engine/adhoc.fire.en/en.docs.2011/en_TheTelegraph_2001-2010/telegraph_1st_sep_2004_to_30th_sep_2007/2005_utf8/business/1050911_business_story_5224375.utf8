Calcutta, Sept. 10: Hyundai Electronics is eyeing a position among the top three in the consumer electronics business and targets a turnover of Rs 750 crore in the next three years.

 ?We are targeting a turnover of Rs 600 crore this year against Rs 100 crore achieved last year. We expect to grow 30 per cent every year,? Hyundai marketing head R Venkat said.

 The company also sees a 200 per cent growth this fiscal in the eastern region.

 ?The east has seen good business and we expect to double our market share in the colour television segment in the next one year,? eastern region head Shivaji Mohinta said. At present, the company enjoys a 6 per cent share by selling around 2.86 lakh units annually.

 ?We also plan to strengthen the dealer network from 225 to 400 by the end of this fiscal,? he added.

 Like other consumer appliances companies, Hyundai is also banking upon the festive season to add to its sales.

 ?Almost 30 per cent of total turnover will come from these two months,? said Venkat. ?We have earmarked Rs 12 crore for promotional activities during this period.?

 The company plans to launch slim flat CTV and digital still cameras, and introduce an entry-level CTV to tap the rural market.

 3G phones push up Sony Ericsson sales

 Say cheese!

 Stockholm, Jan. 18 (Reuters): Swedish-Japanese mobile phone maker Sony Ericsson reported higher fourth-quarter sales and average selling prices than expected on Tuesday, saying its 3G handsets and camera phones were driving the growth.

 But pretax profit at the worlds sixth-biggest mobile phone maker was ?140 million ($182.2 million), the company said, against 165 million euros expected in a Reuters poll of 11 analysts.

 Sales were ?2.0 billion against expectations of ?1.93 billion and up from ?1.4 billion the year before. 

 The company sold 12.6 million phones, beating expectations of 12.5 million and up from 8.0 million in the last quarter of 2003.

 Sony Ericsson, created in 2001 from the handset units of mobile network maker Ericsson and consumer electronics giant Sony, said the sales growth was driven mainly by demand for its 3G phones as well as GSM colour screen camera phones.

 ?Strong growth in fourth quarter was led by good up-take of our latest 3G UMTS phone which has laid the groundwork for future expansion of our 3G portfolio,? chief executive Miles Flint said.

 The firm said its average selling price was ?160, up from ?157 in the third quarter and higher than the expected ?154, beating its own October forecast of a flat quarter-on-quarter ASP.

 ?The average price per unit is significantly better than expected and that is very important,? said Helena Nordman-Knutsson, analyst at Ohman brokerage. ?The other positive thing in the report is that they at least have kept their market share.?

 The company estimated its market share at just above 7 per cent in October, while independent researchers like Gartner put its market share at 6.4 in the third quarter down from 6.6 in the second.

 Sony Ericsson is benefiting from booming global demand for mobile phones and a growing portfolio of popular handsets.

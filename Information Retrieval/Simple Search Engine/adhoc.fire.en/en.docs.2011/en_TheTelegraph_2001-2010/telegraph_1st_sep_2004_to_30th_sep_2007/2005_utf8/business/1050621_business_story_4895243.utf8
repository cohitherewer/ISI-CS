 Heinz to pay $855m for Danones UK business

 Adding flavour

 New York/London, June 20 (Reuters): US food giant H. J. Heinz has agreed to buy Danones UK-based HP Foods business for about $855 million in a deal that puts HP and Lea amp; Perrins sauces under the same roof as its own Heinz Ketchup. 

 The Pittsburgh-company said on Monday the cash purchase would help it focus more around four core areas comprising condiments, meals and snacks, infant nutrition and foodservices, while Frances Danone said it would focus almost exclusively on water, yogurts and biscuits. 

 Analysts said Heinz was buying a collection of largely UK domestic brands such as HP and Daddies sauces, with only Lea amp; Perrins Worcestershire sauce a truly global brand. 

 Its a highly profitable business and will fit well with Heinz, but its not a top-notch price because its not a top notch business, said analyst David Lang at Investec Securities. 

 Danones shares were off 0.88 per cent at 73.55 euros. 

 Heinz said it expected the acquisition to be accretive in the first full fiscal year and to close in the next few weeks pending all regulatory approvals. 

 Danone chief financial officer Emmanuel Faber said the HP business had annual sales of 240 million euros ($291.3 million), which meant the purchase price valued the business at 2.5 to 3 times sales. The price amounted to 11 times its earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation.

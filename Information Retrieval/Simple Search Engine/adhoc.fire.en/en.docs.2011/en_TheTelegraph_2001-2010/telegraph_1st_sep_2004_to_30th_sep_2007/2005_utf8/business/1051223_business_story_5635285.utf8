 Calcutta, Dec. 22: Come February and Bengal will have its first gas-producing field after years of wait.

 Great Eastern Energy Corporation Limited, a company engaged in exploration of coal-bed methane (CBM), will start production from its Raniganj field soon.

 Of the planned 100 CBM wells, the company will start drilling in 20 in the first phase from February-March 2006, Great Eastern Energy chairman and managing director Y.K. Modi said.

 The company has already struck deals with local steel and power companies, including the Steel Authority of India Limited and Dishergarh Power Supply Limited, to supply the gas from its well head.

 The company will also convert CBM into compressed natural gas (CNG) and has tied up with a local firm to supply CNG for the transport sector in the region.

 In keeping with the objectives of the National Urban Transport Policy to control emission and pollution, New Delhi and Mumbai have adopted CNG for public transport because of the fuel?s availability in the adjacent areas. However, Calcutta has been unable to switch to CNG due to a lack of supply in the region.

 ?We will soon hold talks with the Bengal government for the CNG venture,? said Modi.

 CBM is methane found in coal seams and is produced by non-traditional means. The commercial production of CBM has been undertaken in several coal-rich countries, including the US and China.

 In the eastern region, CBM is found in Jharia, Raniganj, Bokaro, Karanpura and Madhavpura. ONGC, Essar and Reliance are engaged in the exploration of CBM.

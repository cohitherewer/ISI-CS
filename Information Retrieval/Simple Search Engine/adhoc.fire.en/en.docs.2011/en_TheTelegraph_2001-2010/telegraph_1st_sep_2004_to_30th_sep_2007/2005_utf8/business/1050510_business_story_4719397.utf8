 Toyota offers a helping hand to rev up GM 

 smooth drive

 Tokyo, May 9 (Reuters): Toyota Motor Corp is open to supplying its hybrid technology to General Motors Corp to help its ailing US rival regain competitiveness, the Japanese auto makers chairman said on Monday.

 Hiroshi Okuda made the comments two weeks after expressing concern about the health of the US industry, saying voluntary price hikes and technical tie-ups could be ways to help peers like GM and Ford Motor Co catch their breath as they lose market share to foreign brands.

 GM currently has an agreement with DaimlerChrysler AG to jointly develop a ?two-mode? hybrid system by 2007 for use in bigger vehicles like pick-up trucks.

 ?I dont know how well (GM and DaimlerChryslers hybrid alliance) is working out, but if theres a chance for Toyota to supply technology to GM, its something wed be interested in,? Okuda told a news conference in his capacity as chairman of Japans biggest business lobby, the Japan Business Federation.

 It is not clear whether selling hybrid cars would help GMs bottomline since the system, which twins an electric motor and a gasoline engine to increase fuel efficiency, is expensive to develop and produce.

 But supplying the technology to more auto makers would definitely benefit Toyota by raising output volumes and thus reducing per-unit production costs.

 Toyota has so far signed up Nissan Motor Co to buy its hybrid system and has an agreement to license part of the technology to Ford.

 Okudas comments also follow a report in the Asian Wall Street Journal on Monday that GM chief executive Rick Wagoner would meet top Toyota officials in mid-May to discuss a possible technology-sharing deal on hybrid vehicles when he visits Japan.

 Okuda confirmed the meeting would take place but stressed it had been planned since last year to coincide with Wagoners visit to the World Expo site near Toyotas headquarters in Aichi prefecture.

 Executives of the two companies, which jointly own a car assembly plant in California, occasionally meet at auto shows and other venues.

 ?Its not that either Toyota or GM has a specific topic that will be brought to the meeting,? he said.

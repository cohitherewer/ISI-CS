 Rejig recipe dilutes oil bosses powers

 S.P.S. PANNU

 New Delhi, July 15: The advisory committee on synergy in energy has recommended a radical management restructuring of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).

 If the suggestion is implemented, the powers of ONGC chairman and managing director Subir Raha and his IOC counterpart Sarthak Behuria will be drastically pruned with a team of vice-chairmen-cum-managing directors looking after the daily operations. Executive directors at the field level will also be made more powerful.

 The committee has recommended that the managing director of ONGC-Videsh (OVL) be made the vice-chairman of the ONGC board to give him a better grip on overseas operations. It has advised that a separate vice-chairman and managing director be appointed for handling the domestic operations of ONGC.

 Under the new structure, these incumbents should be accountable for the daily operations in their respective spheres while the chairman should concentrate on policy matters and look after statutory requirements. A similar arrangement should be considered for IOC, the report said.

 The committee said at present, the CMD of ONGC has to look after policy issues, performance of the company, daily functioning of both domestic and overseas operations. This sphere is considered too vast for the CMD to handle effectively. 

 The committee also feels that there is a need to reduce the number of functional directors with board-level responsibilities in the public sector oil companies.

 The staff for each functional area should report to the executive director concerned, who should be delegated the authority for decision-making and implementation. This will enable the directors on the board to pay attention to policy issues instead of limiting themselves to their respective functional area, the report said. 

 The committee feels that the number of government directors on the board of the public sector oil companies should preferably be two and, in no case, exceed three.

 The committee has observed that there is a total absence of any representation on the board of the public sector oil companies for minority shareholders, who hold 10 to 49 per cent of the shares.

 In order to set improved standards of corporate governance, a minority shareholder representative needs to be inducted on the boards of the oil companies, the report said. 

 It has cited the example of Brazilian state oil company Petrobras and Chinese oil firms to buttress its argument.

 Calcutta, April 22: LG Electronics India (LGEIL) will focus on the premium lifestyle segment so that it contributes 30 per cent to the company?s turnover in the next five years.

 LGEIL managing director Kwang-Ro Kim said, ?We plan to set up exclusive sales channels for the premium products. This year we will focus on marketing premium products and 10 per cent of the Rs 300-crore marketing budget has been set aside for this purpose.?

 Currently, premium products contribute 10 per cent to the turnover and enjoy only 5 per cent of the total market share.

 The company has set up X-Canvas for audio-visual displays, Vision for high-end airconditioners, Shoppe for home appliances and Cyber Shoppe for IT and communication products.

 LGEIL will also manufacture all premium products at the Noida facility from next year. At present, these products are imported from the Korea facility.

 ?In the next five years, we plan to invest $150 million (Rs 750 crore),? said Kim. ?Of this, 10 per cent will be spent on premium products.? 

 LG has already invested $160 million in the last seven years.

 LG also plans to begin production of GSM phones by October. The Pune plant has an annual capacity of 2 million, of which 4 lakh phones will be exported.

 ?We will focus on increasing our GSM handset market in India as CDMA phones are sourced from Korea. We expect the IT and communications segment to contribute significantly to our growth,? said Kim.

 Consumer electronics and home appliances contribute 35 per cent each to the company?s turnover, while 30 per cent comes from IT and communications products. 

 LG expects a significant amount of the Rs 9000-crore target for 2005 (Jan-Dec) to come from IT and communications.

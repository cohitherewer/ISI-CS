 Jute retains shine 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 25: The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) has proposed to maintain 100 per cent packaging of foodgrain and sugar in jute sacks during the current financial year. 

 The cabinet committees decision was welcomed by the jute industry circles here as the purchase of sacks by the government and other state agencies is its mainstay. 

 The decision is also likely to boost the morale of the jute growers of eastern region as they expect a bumper crop of over 10 million bales during the current year.

 The previous National Democratic Alliance government had proposed progressive dilution of the Jute Packaging (compulsory use in packing commodities) Act of 1987 and appointed a Standing Advisory Committee (SAC) comprising representatives of various departments and stakeholders to recommend packaging norms on year-on-year basis. 

 The CCEA took the decision of 100 per cent packaging of food grains and sugar in jute sacks against strong opposition from different quarters including certain government departments.

 Endorsing the views of the industry bodies, the department of chemicals and petrochemicals had proposed food grains packaging in jute sacks at 60 per cent and 40 per cent in case of sugar in the current year.

 The department of food and public distribution had proposed dilution of the compulsory packaging order by 50 per cent for both food grains and sugar.

 But the views of the representatives of the West Bengal government, ministry of agriculture and ministry of textiles for continuation of compulsory packaging of food grains and sugar in jute sacks seemed to have prevailed. 

 The textile ministry issued an order today noting that the decision was taken after considering the commitments ingrained in the National Common Minimum Programme of the UPA government, the National Jute Policy 2005, and the commitments given to Parliament regarding protection of jute growers and industry workers.

 Cement firms on fast track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 23: Markets are taking a fresh look at cement companies, which are poised for robust growth on the back of optimum capacity utilisation and firm prices.

 This bullishness has come after a long period in which growth was weak. In the first half of this financial year, too, prices remained subdued and the markets in the south witnessed negative growth.

 However, with a surge in demand, industry observers are now upbeat. Analysts said with no expansion on the anvil, the existing capacity will be better utilised to meet the rise in demand, leading to healthier margins.

 ?It is good that with a rise in demand there is no fresh capacity hike. This is crucial since the country has been producing more cement than required. Therefore, any uptick in demand adds to margins. Thankfully, we are now witnessing a price discipline in key players,? an analyst said.

 Analyst Karthik Eswar of Khandwala Securities said a hike in cement prices by even a rupee will have the biggest impact on Ultra Tech Cement Company.

 The optimism is also fuelled by the relatively better performance of the cement shares when the sensex was on a downslide.

 However, the Holcim-Ambuja deal did lead to shares of ACC being hammered because of widespread disappointment over the open offer price of Rs 370 apiece. It is anticipated that with the local industry now in a better shape and demand all set to rise, the consolidation process will only pick up in the near future. 

 Observers feel that cement capacities in the range of 1-2 million tonnes will now be under the glare of players, who are planning to expand through the inorganic route. The Chennai-based India Cements has already indicated that it is in the lookout for a strategic partner.

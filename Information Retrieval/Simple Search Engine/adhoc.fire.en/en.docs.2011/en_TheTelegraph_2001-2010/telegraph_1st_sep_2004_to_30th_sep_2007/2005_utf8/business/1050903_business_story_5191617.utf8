 VW cheque for Andhra on way

 G.S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, Sept. 2: Volkswagen representative Frank Elbe will arrive in Hyderabad next week to hand over 2 million euros, or part of it, to the Andhra government.

 The representative of the German company has sought an appointment with chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, said state industry commissioner Sutheertha Bhattacharya.

 Elbe is expected to arrive on Tuesday and will meet the chief minister next day to hand over a cheque for the total amount or part of it, he added. The company has agreed to pay Andhra the Rs 11 crore it invested in a fictitious special purpose vehicle, Vashisht Wahan, set up by Helmuth Schuster, a former executive who swindled money for car projects. Elbe could also carry an invitation for a visit to Germany.

 Legal experts, however, said if the scam-tainted money was recovered in India, Volkswagen might decide not to pay. We, too, will not accept the gesture but plead with Volkswagen to speed up the project in the state, said a government spokesman.

 Part of the stolen money has been traced in CBI probes to a Vashisht Wahan current account, where it was deposited in January this year. Jagdish Raja, one of its directors, used some of the cash (Rs 5 crore) to buy land in Bangalore from V.G. Joseph, chairman of Garden City College. Rajas sister, Gayatri, too, has Rs 2 crore, the CBI has said. She has been traced to London.

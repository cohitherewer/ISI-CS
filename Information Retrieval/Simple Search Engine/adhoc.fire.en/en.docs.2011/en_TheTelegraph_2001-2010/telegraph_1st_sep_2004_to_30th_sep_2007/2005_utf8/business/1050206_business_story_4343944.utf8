 Hyundai net profit dips 21%

 Thoughtful 

 Seoul, Feb. 5 (Reuters): Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea?s top carmaker, posted a surprise 21 per cent drop in quarterly profit, hit by a stronger won and higher steel prices.

 Analysts say the Korean carmaker will struggle in the current 2005 first quarter as weak local sales are unlikely to revive until the second half and export growth slows. 

 ?The results were much worse than expected,? said Park Kum-yung, a fund manager at Mirae Asset Co. 

 ?Hyundai does not have great potential this year, mainly because a stronger won is really going to eat into its exports, hitting profits. High steel prices are also another negative.?

 Strong steel prices and the won?s uptrend pose a serious challenge to Hyundai, which is aiming to increase car sales by 14 per cent this year to 2.39 million units, analysts have said. 

 Hyundai, ranked seventh in the US, the world?s biggest car market, said it expected sales to rise 3.6 per cent this year to 28.4 trillion won and operating profit to jump 21 per cent to 2.4 trillion won. 

 Investors are pinning their faith on the launch of Hyundai?s flagship NF Sonata sedan in the US market and good growth in Europe and emerging markets such as China and India to drive the company this year. 

 Last month, Hyundai overtook Volkswagen, once the undisputed leader in China, the world?s fastest growing car market, selling more than 20,000 units. 

 October-December net profit fell to 361.4 billion won ($352.6 million) from 459.4 billion won, lagging a consensus forecast for a 14 percent profit rise to 524.1 billion won. 

 Smaller losses from affiliate Hyundai Card Co. and the sale of stakes in Hyundai Capital Services Inc. ? General Electric Co.s financing unit bought a 38 per cent stake for 432 billion won in October ? brought in one-off gains. 

 At an operating level, Hyundai faces a firmer won and higher steel prices that make its vehicles more pricey overseas. The won jumped 11 per cent and steel prices rose 8 per cent in the final 2004 quarter.

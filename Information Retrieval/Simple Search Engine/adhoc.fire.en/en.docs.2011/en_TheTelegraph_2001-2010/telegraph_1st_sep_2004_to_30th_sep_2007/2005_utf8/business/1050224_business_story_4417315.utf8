 Rosneft, ONGC in tieup talks 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 23: Russian oil major Rosneft and ONGC-Videsh Limited (OVL) are exploring the possibility of a partnership in 11 oil and gas projects in Russia.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar was quoted by agencies as saying, ?We have agreed on a basket of discovered fields in Russia, which might include Sakhalin-3, Vankor and number of others. Rosneft has indicated that it would want to take ONGC along in 11 identified projects.?

 Expressing his inability to elaborate due to the ?confidentiality clause?, Aiyar said, ?11 potential projects are under consideration in Russia. In due course, OVL and Rosneft are to issue a joint statement identifying these projects.? He, however, indicated that some of these projects might require President Vladimir Putin?s intervention. Responding to a question about ONGC picking up a stake in the Yuganz oilfield of Yukos, Aiyar said, ?We are very much on board.?

 He is reported to have discussed the issue with deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zhukov and energy minister Viktor Khristenko.

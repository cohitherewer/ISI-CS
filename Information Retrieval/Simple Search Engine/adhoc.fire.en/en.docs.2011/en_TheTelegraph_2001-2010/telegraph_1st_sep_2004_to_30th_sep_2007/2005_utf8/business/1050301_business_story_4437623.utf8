 Car prices seen in top gear

 RAJA GHOSHAL

New Delhi, Feb. 28: There is bad news for all those who put off car purchases in anticipation of an excise cut in the budget: prices are actually going to rise.

 The tax breaks auto-makers were hoping for have not arrived. Instead, carmakers are expected to raise prices by about 4 to 6 per cent because of the new engine technology they need to harness to comply with the tough tail-pipe emission standards from April 1. And we haven?t even begun to count up the impact of the steel price rise on account of the excise duty increase of 12 to 16 per cent.

 But those who were looking to buy the high-end cars may stand to benefit from the lowering of customs duty on auto component imports.

 In the case of second-hand imported cars, custom duties have come down only marginally from 105 to 100 per cent.

 ?The auto industry welcomes the move towards rationalisation of customs tariffs and the reduction in customs duty on inputs and raw materials from 20 per cent to 15 per cent.

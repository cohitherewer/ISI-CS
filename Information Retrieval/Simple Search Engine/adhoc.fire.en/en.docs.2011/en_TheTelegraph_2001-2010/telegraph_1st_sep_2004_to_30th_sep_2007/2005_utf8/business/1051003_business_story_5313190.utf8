 Promoters to cut stake in Shreyas Shipping

 Mumbai, Oct. 2: Shreyas Shipping Ltd is looking at a strategic partner to whom it can offload a part of its equity.

 The promoter holding in Shreyas Shipping is close to 82 per cent. The company has aggressive growth plans in containerised shipping and logistics, a sector set to witness rapid growth in the days ahead. 

 The Shreyas board had recently approved a capital expenditure of around Rs 350 crore over the next one year. 

 The board had also approved an investment in Shreyas Relay Systems to make the company its wholly-owned subsidiary. The company will provide customised multi-modal logistics and transportation in the country and the sub-continent apart from undertaking other activities such as warehousing and distribution.

 Sources said divesting a part of the stake to a strategic partner should be also seen in the context of recent guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), which has capped promoter holding in a company at 75 per cent. 

 According to Sebi guidelines, promoters with higher stakes will have to either prune their shares to 75 per cent or below or make an open offer through a reverse book-building route to buy back and de-list its shares from the exchanges within a stipulated timeframe.

 Industry observers said Malaysia International Shipping Corporation, Berhad, the worlds largest LNG shipowner, in which Petroliam Nasional Berhad (Petronas) has a 62 per cent holding, is also in the race to pick up a stake in Shreyas. 

 Malaysia International Shipping Corporation officials have recently said the company is in negotiations with Indian companies for joint ventures in LNG and crude oil transportation. It has, however, not talked about the company picking up any stake in an Indian shipping company.

 Recent reports say Shreyas is engaged in negotiations with Malaysia International Shipping Corporation in many areas, one of which include a possible joint venture in LNG shipping.

 Shreyas senior officials were not available for comments. However, sources close to the company denied that such plans were afoot.

 Reliance deal makes India Inc happy

 New Delhi, June 18: India Inc is happy over the settlement reached between the two Ambani brothers over the ownership issues of Reliance Industries.

 The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has welcomed the reconciliation between the Ambani brothers saying the move will provide strength and stability to the Reliance empire. The industry chamber feels that this will also benefit the stakeholders of the company.

 While the eldest of the Ambani brothers, Mukesh, will have the responsibility for managing Reliance Industries and IPCL, the younger sibling Anil will manage Reliance Infocomm, Reliance Energy and Reliance Capital.

 Industrialists said that the amicable settlement of the Reliance group companies will also boost the capital markets.

 Besides giving tremendous boost to the capital market, the development will also uplift the morale of investors who have already parked their surpluses in the Reliance companies. It will also help re-build investor confidence, said Mahendra K Sanghi, president, Assocham.

 However, the seven-month-long battle between the Ambani siblings had no effect on the die-hard investors. The RIL investors pocketed Rs 10,000 crore since the elder brother Mukesh publicly raised the ownership issues on November 18 and virtually declared war with his brother over the Reliance empire.

 Between November 22 and the announcement of the settlement by mother Kokilaben today, RILs market capitalisation rose by about 13 per cent to Rs 83,729.05 crore from Rs 74,399 crore. The scrip was last traded at Rs 600.80.

 Onkar S. Kanwar, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) said, I am happy that the Ambani brothers have arrived at an amicable settlement of the pending issues.

 RIL director Y. P. Trivedi today said, The settlement between the two Ambani brothers is good for the investors and the two can work under one umbrella.

 Adi B. Godrej, chairman, Godrej group, said, It is an excellent development for the shareholders of Reliance. The companys market cap did not rise with the Sensex (share price index on the Mumbai Stock Exchange). It will now be brought to the fore. The problems are behind us.

 The lesson for Indian family-run businesses from the Ambani episode is that whenever such a situation comes, the company should be able to come up with quick solutions. Else, it hurts the shareholders and spoils the companys image, said Arun Bharat Ram, vice-chairman and managing director of SRF Limited.

 New Delhi, Sept. 2: Bharti Tele-Venturess broadband and mobile telecom service, AirTel, will initiate a special drive to expand its operations in 14 circles at an investment of Rs 1,500 crore. This will include starting full-fledged commercial operations in Calcutta.

 The company today crossed the one million-customer-mark. AirTel currently provides broadband and cellular phone services in 66 cities spread over 14 circles. 

 AirTel has so far been slow in pushing through its broadband services in Calcutta.

 Rajan Bharti Mittal, joint managing director, Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd, said, We will give a special thrust to the new circles. The potential customers for broadband in Calcutta will soon get our service and can experience the benefits of high-speed Internet. 

 AirTel unveiled its plans to expand its services to 14 more towns in 10 circles with an investment of more than Rs 700 crore during the current financial year. This will take Bhartis cumulative investment in the broadband and cellular service segment to Rs 3,500 crore.

 We will invest about Rs 600-700 crore in the new circles and about Rs 800-900 crore in the existing four circles for our broadband expansion during 2005-06, said Badri Agrawal, president Infotel Business Group, Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd.

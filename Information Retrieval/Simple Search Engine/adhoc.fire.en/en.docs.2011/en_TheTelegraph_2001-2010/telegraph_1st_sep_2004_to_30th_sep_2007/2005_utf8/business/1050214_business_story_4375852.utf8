 ONGC blow to fertiliser units

 S. P. S. PANNU 

 The lifeline

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has slashed the supply of natural gas to the fertiliser sector from 30 million standard cubic metres per day to 18 of the same unitin the last year or so, forcing the industry to switch over to naphtha as an input, which is five times more expensive. 

 Fertiliser secretary S. N. P. N. Sinha told The Telegraph that the fertiliser industry had plunged into a crisis due to the high input costs. ?The government will have to shoulder an additional subsidy burden of Rs 6,000 crore during the current fiscal,? he said.

 He confirmed that ONGC had drastically reduced natural gas supplies to the fertiliser firms on the grounds that the output of the Mumbai High fields had gone down due to their increasing age. ONGC gas was being supplied to fertiliser units at Rs 4,000 per tonne while the price of naphtha, which has been substituted as a feedstock, is hovering at around Rs 22,000 per tonne. 

 To make matters worse, the price of other fertiliser inputs such as phosphoric acid being used to produce phosphatic fertilisers has been ruling between $350 and $400 per tonne during the current financial year compared with around $180 per tonne in the last fiscal. 

 ONGC has been complaining about the low price that it is getting for its natural gas, which has to be sold far below international prices. The petroleum ministry has been supporting the ONGC and OIL case for an increase in price. However, the ministries of fertiliser and power have locked horns with the petroleum ministry on the ground that the prices of fertiliser and power being supplied to consumers is also regulated and any increase in the price of natural gas will render these units unviable. 

 In order to keep the power plants and fertiliser units going, the government would end up incurring a huge subsidy burden if the price of natural gas was to be increased. 

 Similarly, the price of liquefied natural gas (LNG), which is being imported by Petronet LNG, has also become a contentious issue. 

 To resolve the imbroglio, the government has set up two separate groups of ministers. While one, headed by defence minister Pranab Mukherjee, is going into the natural gas pricing issue, the other, being chaired by finance minister P. Chidambaram, is looking into the price of LNG.

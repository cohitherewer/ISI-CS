 Q amp;A

 Into the PAN 

 Can I apply for a PAN through the Internet?

 Rajeev Bose, by e-mail

 Yes, application for fresh allotment of PAN can be made through the Internet. Further requests for changes or correction in PAN data or request for new PAN card (for an existing PAN) may also be made through the Net.

 Advance pay

 Is advance salary taxed in the year of receipt?

 S. Dhawal, Jamshedpur

 The Income Tax Act assumes tax on salary that is due, whether paid or not, at the latest possible point of time, which is the date when the salary accrues or becomes due. However, where any salary paid in advance is assessed in the year of payment, it cannot be taxed again when it becomes due. Similarly, if arrears of salary have been assessed on the due basis in the past, they are not liable to be taxed again when they are paid.

 TAN made easy

 What is TAN and who must apply for TAN?

 Srijita Mitra, Calcutta

 TAN or tax deduction and collection account number is a 10-digit alpha numeric number available with those responsible for deducting or collecting tax. It is compulsory to quote TAN in tax deducted at source (TDS) or tax collected at source (TCS) returns (including any e-TDS or TCS return), any such payment challan and certificates. All individuals, who are required to deduct tax at source or collect tax at source on behalf of the income tax department, have to apply for and obtain TAN.

 Leave salary

 Is salary payable for a leave period to non-resident Indians taxable, even if the period is spent outside India?

 Saikat Ghose, by e-mail

 Salary paid for services rendered in India is regarded as income earned in India. Thus, any salary payable for a leave period, which is both preceded or succeeded by service in India, forms part of the service contract of employment and will also be regarded as income earned in India and thus taxed.

 Bajaj Hind savours taste of sugar price 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 12: Bajaj Hindusthan Ltd, the countrys leading sugar producer, is upbeat about its profit guidance for 2005-06 due to better prices and higher output. 

 The companys earnings leapt 130 per cent during the fiscal ended September 30. Net profit stood at Rs 140.4 crore against Rs 61 crore in the previous year. 

 Bajaj Hindusthan, which is scaling up volumes rapidly, has posted a 66 per cent rise in revenues at Rs 900.1 crore compared with Rs 543 crore a year earlier.

 Taking stock of the companys performance, the board has a 50 per cent dividend and okayed plans to set up new distilleries to augment BHLs alcohol capacity.

 With sugar realisation expected to touch Rs 17.50 per kg in 2005-06, up from Rs 16.67 in the previous year, and sugar production doubling to 0.86 million tonnes, the company is aiming at a turnover of Rs 1,725 crore, a 92 per cent year-on-year growth.

 Speaking to newspersons here today, Kushagra Nayan Bajaj, chief executive, BHL, said a bullish sentiment is also prevailing in the global sugar market.

 Brazil, one of the major sugar producers in the world, is increasingly shifting cane to ethanol production. Other sugar-producing nations are China, the US, India, Australia and Thailand. 

 Even as China and India are fast approaching the peak production capability, a move by the European Commission to slash the subsidy on white sugar and sugar beets may stop EU from exporting white sugar.

 According to Bajaj, India is likely to produce around 17.50 million tonnes of sugar this season, while the demand is likely to be 19.25 million tonnes. Though the country is expected to produce 20 million tonnes of sugar in 2006-07, he said India would still have no inventory and import sugar.

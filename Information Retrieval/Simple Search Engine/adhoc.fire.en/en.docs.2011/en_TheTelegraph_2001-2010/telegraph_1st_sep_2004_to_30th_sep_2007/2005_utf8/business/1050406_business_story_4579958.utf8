 Pfizer lowers profit forecast

 New York, April 5 (Reuters): Pfizer Inc, the world?s biggest drugmaker, on Tuesday forecast 2005 earnings at the low end of Wall Street expectations and targeted $4 billion in cost savings through 2008 as it struggles with generic competition and waning demand for its arthritis drugs amid safety concerns.

 While CEO Hank McKinnell called 2005 ?a transition year?, Pfizer said it expects reduced costs and revenue from new products will drive double-digit profit growth in 2007.

 The 2005 outlook, presented at an investor meeting in New York, signals a marked downturn for Pfizer, which has boasted industry-topping earnings growth in recent years thanks to medicines acquired through mergers with Warner-Lambert Corp and Pharmacia Corp and huge merger-related cost savings.

 But the company said it expects a turnaround after this year, sparking investor optimism. Shares of Pfizer, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, rose 97 cents to $26.90 in early trading.

 ?We expect our performance to rebound quickly in 2006 and accelerate in 2007 as we increasingly realise the benefits of the continued growth of major in-line products, new product launches and productivity initiatives,? McKinnell said.

 Pfizer forecast 2005 earnings of $2 per share excluding one-time items, compared with analysts? expectations of between $1.99 and $2.35. Last year the company earned $2.12 per share before special items.

 Pfizer blamed its reversal of fortune largely on patent expirations that opened the floodgates to cheaper generic forms of four company drugs that once had combined US annual sales of more than $5 billion: anti-fungal drug Diflucan, epilepsy treatment Neurontin, antibiotic Zithromax, and Accupril for high blood pressure.

 Pfizer in February said it was reviewing its operations amid a sharp contraction in earnings growth. But it said speculation about job cuts was premature.

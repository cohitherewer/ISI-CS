 The auto major is planning to increase its motorcycle production capacity to 2.8 million vehicles per annum by December.

 The companys sales and income from operations rose to Rs 1,605.7 crore against Rs 1,310.1 crore posted during the same period a year ago, it said.

 For the nine-month period ended December 31, the company posted a net profit of Rs 527.1 crore on a total income of Rs 4,280 crore compared with Rs 535.5 crore on a total income of Rs 3,633.2 crore in the year-ago period.

 Total turnover for the nine-month period rose to Rs 4561.6 crore from Rs 3,922.4 crore.

 The company attributed the increase in turnover to the growth in recently rolled-out motorcycle models ? CT 100, Discover and Pulsar ? which posted a robust 63 per cent growth, beating industry growth rate of 29 per cent, it added.

 The company is planning to increase its motorcycle production capacity to 2.8 million vehicles per annum by December, taking its total capacity to 3.6 million vehicles per annum.

 The customer response to Discover and Pulsar upgrade was overwhelming and the company is ramping up production capacities for these products, a release said.

 Bajaj Auto has claimed that it maintained its top exporter status with export of 28,786 two- and 13,355 three-wheelers during the quarter, while that for the nine-month period was 87,221 and 50,933 units, respectively.

 The companys total sales of two-wheelers in the quarter rose 43.3 per cent at 4.77 lakh units (3.33 lakh) during the quarter, while that of its three-wheelers dipped 22.1 per cent at 49,501 vehicles (63,516).

 The decline in sales is due to a combination of slack in demand and freeze on the permits issued by certain states, coupled with lower exports during the quarter, it said.

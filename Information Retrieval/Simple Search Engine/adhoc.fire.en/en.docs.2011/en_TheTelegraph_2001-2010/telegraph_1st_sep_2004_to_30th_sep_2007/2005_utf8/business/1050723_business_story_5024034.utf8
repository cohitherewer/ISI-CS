 Trai for number portability

 New Delhi, July 22: Subscribers may soon be able to retain their mobile telephone numbers, even if they change their service providers within a circle.

 Fixed-line subscribers may also get the same facility if the experiment with mobiles succeeds. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today came out with a consultation paper on mobile number portability seeking operators? comments by August 30.

 Globally, there are three types of number portability: operator-based (AirTel to Hutch), location-based (Delhi to Calcutta), and service-based (from mobile to fixed-line). However, Trai proposes to allow switches only between operators at this stage.

 According to Trai, there is a stiff competition among mobile service providers, which is beneficial for a consumer. ?Mobile number portability may increase the competition further,? the paper said.

 About 30 per cent of all mobile subscribers are likely to shift to another operator offering better services if given the option, according to International Data Corporation (IDC).

 Given the growth of telecom services and competition in the mobile sector, the telecom regulator feels that the time is ripe for a discussion on mobile number portability.

 Trai said the Netherlands had decided to implement number portability when cellular penetration was under 10 per cent and Pakistan initiated the process even when only 6.91 per cent of its people had cell phones. 

 Therefore, it is possible to initiate talks even though the market is not mature or saturated, the paper said.

 ?By the time the number portability is implemented, the telecom market would have expanded,? said Trai.

 The consultation paper explains the concept of number portability and highlights the technical, operational and economic issues involved. While India can learn from the international experience, some specific issues such as ensuring tariff transparency and amending the National Numbering Plan will need careful consideration, Trai said.

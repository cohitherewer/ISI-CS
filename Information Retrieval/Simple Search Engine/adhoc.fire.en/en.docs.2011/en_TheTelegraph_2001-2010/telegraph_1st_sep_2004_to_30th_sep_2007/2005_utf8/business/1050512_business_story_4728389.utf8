 States given bigger role in SEZ bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 11: The Rajya Sabha today approved the special economic zone (SEZ) bill after the CPM forced changes in two clauses to allow state governments a bigger say in the setting up of the zones and removing the Centres power to change labour laws through a mere notification.

 CPM leader in the Rajya Sabha, Nilotpal Basu, met commerce minister Kamal Nath and defence minister Pranab Mukherjee and insisted that these changes be introduced before the bill was tabled in the Upper House.

 Clause 49 of the bill, which gives the central government sweeping powers to introduce changes in the SEZs by issuing a notification, will exclude labour laws from its purview. 

 Clause 3, which deals with the procedure for setting up a special economic zone, earlier permitted private parties to set up a zone and obtain the concurrence of the state government later. This has been amended and the state governments will now have to be consulted before these zones can be set up. 

 The bill was passed by a voice vote in Rajya Sabha after the commerce minister assured the House that labour laws would not be trespassed.

 The bill will now be sent back to the Lok Sabha for ratification of the changes introduced in the Rajya Sabha.

 Winding up the discussion, Nath assured members that the setting up of SEZs within the legal framework would instil confidence among investors.

 He said 35 proposals had been received for setting up SEZs with investments to the tune of $2 billion in the next three years.

 Nath asserted the SEZs would generate more employment. This was evident from the fact that $80 billion of exports during the last financial year generated 10 lakh jobs.

 He said the export target was achieved despite the appreciation of rupee and high oil prices. 

 Kamal Nath expects another 50,000 persons to get employment in the next year after the creation of the SEZs. The current figure is about 95,000. 

 The bill provides a single-window clearance and approval mechanism for establishing SEZs as well as setting up production units in these zones.

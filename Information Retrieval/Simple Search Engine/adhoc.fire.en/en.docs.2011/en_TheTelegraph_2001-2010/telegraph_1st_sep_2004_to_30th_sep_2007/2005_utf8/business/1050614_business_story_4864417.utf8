The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 BSNL hooked to fixed-line users

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, June 13: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) is focussing on the fixed-line telephone business as private players like Tata Teleservices and Reliance Infocomm are aggressively targeting fixed-line users.

 BSNL has seen a decline in its average revenue per user (ARPU) from Rs 551 per month in 2003-04 to Rs 525 per month last year. According to analysts, this could reduce to around Rs 450 per month by the end of the year. Compared with this, private operators are earning an ARPU between Rs 600 and Rs 650 per month.

 BSNL is also concerned over the stagnating subscriber base. The telecom majors customer base grew from 34.59 lakh in 2003-04 to 35.85 lakh in 2004-05. Contrary to this, Tata Telecom and Reliance Infocomm added around 2.5 lakh fixed-line subscribers in May, according to available statistics.

 BSNL has to concentrate on retaining subscribers through improved customer care and focussed marketing, said an analyst. The huge opportunity that exists in fixed-line and the public call office (PCO) segments is evident from the growth of the business of private operators. The fixed-line business is more profitable as the ARPU is always higher than from mobile phones.

 The PCO business, with an average Rs 4,000 per month revenue per line and up to Rs 10,000 per month in high footfall areas, is a major business opportunity, the analyst added.

 BSNL is also worried regarding the churn of customers and preference for private operators. 

 A circular issued by the management states that there was a 16.82 per cent decline in minutes of usage by high callers as well as a 4.51 per cent decline in the subscriber base. Usage among corporate customers has also dipped by 11 per cent.

 BSNL is losing out heavily on corporate and small and medium businesses, said the analyst. Private operators offer better service and attractive incentive schemes.

 A corporate intelligence wing has to be constituted to analyse competitors strategies, tariffs and other factors to help take proactive measures rather than reactive efforts, the circular stated.

 The circular also states that BSNL should use the CDMA or wireless technology to develop the untapped user base.

 However, the low-end subscriber base have also dropped 15.91 per cent, though the ARPU has gone up by 2.8 per cent and the average minutes of usage has grown 4.86 per cent.

 The high-volume growth in international long distance calls have resulted in a mere 5 per cent growth in revenues as tariffs have declined by almost 25 per cent.

 BSNL is also concerned as its STD/PCO revenues have declined by 15.33 per cent with the number of public call offices reducing from 14,000 to 12,000. However, local PCOs have seen an overall revenue growth of 50.61 per cent mainly due to the pulse reduction from 180 seconds to 90 seconds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Tech twins set for a tango

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 10: The earnings season will kick off in its true sense tomorrow with infotech titans, Infosys Technologies Ltd and Tata Consultancy Services, announcing their second quarter results. There is an optimism in the equity markets and both the companies are expected to report a sequential 7-10 per cent growth on their net profits.

 Analysts expect Infosys to post a net profit of Rs 570-580 crore. Similarly, for TCS, the countrys largest software company, the figure has been put between Rs 653 crore and Rs 685 crore.

 MphasiS BFL, whose second-quarter numbers will also come out tomorrow, is, however, expected to post lower numbers as the period was marred by uncertainty. Barings India Investments, MphasiSs biggest investor, was looking for an exit option. However, subsequently Barings clarified that it has no such plans.

 Analysts pointed out that the second quarter is traditionally considered a strong period for IT companies.

 During its first-quarter results, Infosys had projected an income of around Rs 2,202-2,215 crore. It is likely to beat these estimates and post revenues in the range of Rs 2,260 crore and Rs 2,285 crore. 

 TCSs net sales, on the other hand, is expected to cross Rs 2,900 crore.

 The depreciation of the rupee has also added to the positive mood. The Indian currency has been under pressure against the US greenback in recent times. As most software companies earn huge revenues from exports, any depreciation in the rupee will only swell their bottomline. 

 Even a 1 per cent depreciation in the rupee will have an impact of at least 1.5 per cent on the earnings per share, said an analyst. 

 Though IT firms benefit from the rupees loss against the dollar, analysts feel that hedging by companies like Infosys may trim the benefits accruing from any depreciation in the rupees value.

 While observers are keeping their fingers crossed, the market is certain that the second-quarter numbers will not disappoint. The optimism was reflected in todays trade when nearly all infotech shares gained. For instance, Infosys gained Rs 53.05 to close at Rs 2,622.45, TCS ended the day at Rs 1,449.30, up by Rs 3.85. Satyam Computers and Wipro also ended in the green.

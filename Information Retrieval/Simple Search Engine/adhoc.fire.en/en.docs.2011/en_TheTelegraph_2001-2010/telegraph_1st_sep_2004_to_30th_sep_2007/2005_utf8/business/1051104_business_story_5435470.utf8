 Mumbai, Nov. 3: After the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has stepped in to encourage the use of hallmarked jewellery. 

 The RBI asked commercial banks in a recent circular to insist on hallmarked jewellery as collalteral against loans.

 ?Hallmarked jewellery ensures the quality of the yellow metal used in the jewellery regarding the carat, fineness and purity. Therefore, banks will find granting of advances against the security of such hallmarked jewellery safer and easier. 

 ?The preferential treatment will encourage the practice of hallmarking of jewellery, which will be in the interest of the consumer, lenders and the industry in the long run,? the notification pointed out.

 The apex bank said while granting advances against jewellery, banks should keep in view the advantages of hallmarked jewellery and then decide on the margin and rates of interest.

 Banking industry sources said the RBI suggestion would indirectly encourage hallmarking. But they pointed out that banks? advances against gold were not significant in urban centres, though such advances were disbursed in rural areas.

 They also said the small number of jewellers in the country selling hallmarked gold has been a deterrent to its use. According to Yashpal Singh, additional director, BIS, only 1045 of the large number of jewellers in the country are now selling hallmarked gold.

 Welcoming the RBI move, a city-based bullion analyst said on condition of anonymity that the principal responsibility would lie with the consumer. 

 ?People must insist on hallmarked gold while buying and this would significantly increase its use,? he said, adding that consumers? awareness about hallmarked gold has, however, improved significantly in the urban centres.

 The BIS is planning to open hallmarking centres in over 40 districts of the country from the present 33 centres. More than half of this number is situated in the southern part of the country.

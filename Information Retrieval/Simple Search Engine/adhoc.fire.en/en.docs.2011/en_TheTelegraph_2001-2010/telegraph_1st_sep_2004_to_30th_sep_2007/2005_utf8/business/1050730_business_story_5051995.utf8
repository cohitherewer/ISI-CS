 L amp;T jumps out of John Deere tractor

 Naik: Focused

 Mumbai, July 29: Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) will sell its stake in L amp;T-John Deere Private Limited ? a joint venture manufacturing agricultural tractors ? to sharpen its focus in its core business.

 The engineering, technology and construction company is exiting the tractor business in favour of its joint venture partner Deere and Company, a global player in tractors, L amp;T chairman A.M. Naik said.

 Experts say this move is part of L amp;Ts plan to exit from non-core businesses. A couple of years ago the company exited from its cement business as well.

 L amp;T officials said the company has exited the joint venture with Deere and Company for a fair consideration.

 The joint venture was formed with Deere to manufacture agricultural tractors in 1997. 

 Commercial operations started in 2000 at a manufacturing facility near Pune. The tractors are made at three inter-linked factories: transmission, engine and vehicle assembly units.

 Initially, in line with the technological expertise of its American partner, the local JV decided to venture into the higher horse-power range of 50 hp to 70 hp. It quickly achieved a key position in the premium segment of the tractor market.

 However, after experiencing the countrys agricultural needs, the JV started manufacturing lower horse-power tractors in the range of 47 hp-37 hp.

 The divestment by L amp;T comes at a time when the tractor industry is perking up and companies are slowly but surely making a turnaround. 

 There is a consolidation in the industry with Tafe acquiring Eicher Tractors.

 M amp;M is battling John Deere in the US and it is expected that the American company will pose a stiff competition to M amp;M at home.

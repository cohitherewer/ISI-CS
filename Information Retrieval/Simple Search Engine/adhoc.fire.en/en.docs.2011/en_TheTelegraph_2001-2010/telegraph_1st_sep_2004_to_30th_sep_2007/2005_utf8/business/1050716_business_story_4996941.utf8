 Oil trio to share Rs 3249cr subsidy burden

 New Delhi, July 15 (PTI): The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), Gail (India) Ltd and Oil India Ltd (OIL) will pay Rs 3,249 crore to oil marketing firms to partly cover the losses they made in the April-June period on selling petrol, diesel, LPG and kerosene at a subsidised rate.

 ONGC will pay Rs 2,876 crore, Gail Rs 153 crore and OIL Rs 220 crore to cover one-third of the about Rs 9,800 crore revenue loss suffered by Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp (HPCL) on selling fuel in the first quarter of the current fiscal, a senior official said.

 Of the Rs 3,249 crore contribution by upstream firms, IOC will get around Rs 1,625 crore, while BPCL and HPCL would get about Rs 810 crore each.

 Till last year, upstream firms shared losses only on LPG and kerosene. This year, however, they have been asked to foot even under-realisation on petrol and diesel, the official said.

 ONGCs share in the informal subsidy sharing arrangement has risen more than 300 per cent ? from Rs 797 crore in the first quarter of 2004-05 to Rs 2,876 crore this year.

 For the full fiscal of 2004-05, ONGC had paid a subsidy of Rs 4,104 crore (up 53 per cent from Rs 2,690 crore in 2003-04) to oil refining and marking PSUs by way of incremental discount on crude prices. This pulled down the net profit by Rs 2553.20 crore to Rs 12,983 crore.

 ONGC has gained from the spiralling crude prices. It got $51-$52 per barrel on crude it produced in the April-June period this year against $39 a barrel last year, the official said.

 In 2004-05, ONGC, Gail and OIL had borne around Rs 5,900 crore of LPG and kerosene subsidy. 

 Gail, which had forked out Rs 1,137 crore in 2004-05 towards subsidy on kerosene and Rs 428 crore towards LPG in 2003-04, is being burdened less this fiscal as it does not produce kerosene and the cost of natural gas, which it uses to make LPG, has also gone up.

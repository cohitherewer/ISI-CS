 Calcutta, April 9: A delegation from the Netherlands is exploring possibilities of setting up agro parks in Bengal and is also scouting for joint venture partners here.

 ?We are studying the Indian market and believe that Bengal has good potential in the food processing industry due to its access to cheap labour and surplus agricultural products. Moreover, Calcutta will provide the necessary infrastructure required for the agro parks,? Jan Reint Smith of Senter Novem of the Netherlands said yesterday.

 ?We have visited the cities of Mumbai and Bangalore and interacted with the local manufacturers there. However, the climatic conditions and the production rate in Bengal is more conducive to the industry,? added Novem. It is the first time that a delegation from the Netherlands has visited the state.

 The state also plans to set up two more agri export zones ? one for floriculture in Darjeeling and another for cashewnuts in Midnapore and Bankura districts. ?We are studying the possibilities of setting up these two agri export zones and are also planning a floriculture institute in North Bengal,? said S. S. Ahuja, principal secretary in the department of food processing industries and horticulture.

 Bengal is betting big on the food processing industry and has a separate policy for it, Ahuja said. The state government has already earmarked investments for five agri-export zones.

 In the last three years, an investment of Rs 403 crore has come into the state. In 2003-04 alone, around Rs 200 crore came in, while 31 companies set up operations with Pepsico Frito Lay being the largest.

 In the last decade, the Netherlands had occupied a strong position in the international market for food processing research and development.

 The country has a tieup with the Chinese government to set up a food park spread over 500 hectares. Of that, 50 hectares will be used to set up a central processing unit, while the remaining portion will be utilised for agriculture.

 Infosys ADS priced at $67

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 26: Infosys Technologies American depository shares (ADS), which has garnered close to $1 billion, has been priced at $67 apiece, a mark-up of 34 per cent on the going rate of its stock on exchanges at home.

 The ADS of 1.4 crore shares is underpinned by an equal number of local stock. The success of the flotation could set off a chain-reaction among firms keen to cash in on the demand for Indian technology shares overseas.

 The bulk of the gains, around Rs 1500 crore, will flow to Infosys employees, including its founders who have offered a portion of their holding to international investors. 

 While the price of $67 is higher than the local rates, it is 2.5 per cent less than what its existing ADS fetched at Nasdaq on Wednesday. 

 The underwriters have a seven-day option to purchase up to 20 lakh additional ADS, representing just as many local shares. If they do so, the size of the offering will exceed $1 billion. Around 32 lakh ADS will be placed with Japanese investors through a public offer without listing ? something no Indian firm has done before.

 In April, ICICI Bank had carried out a similar conversion to ADS by allowing its shareholders holding Indian stock to offer it to foreign investors at a premium. 

 Infosys will not receive anything from this offering. The money raised will be distributed within 30 days of the close of the offer to shareholders who sold their stock.

 The offer was managed by Citigroup, Deutsche Bank Securities, Goldman Sachs (Asia) L.L.C. and UBS Investment Bank. 

 ABN AMRO Rothschild, Bank of America Securities and Nomura International were co-managers.

 Maran wins Intel pledge for test unit

 Silicon Valley, June 8 (PTI): Intel Corp, the worlds largest chipmaker, is likely to set up an advanced test manufacturing facility in India at an estimated investment of over $400 million.

 They have more or less decided to come to India. They need some more time to complete formalities, which, I am sure, they will, said Dayanidhi Maran, after a meeting with Intel chairman Craig Barrett.

 During the meeting, designed to impress upon Intel the benefits of setting up the factory in India, the minister also handed over a letter from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in this regard.

 Over the past year, India has been aggressively lobbying firms, including Intel, to set up manufacturing units in the country. I have been discussing with Craig, since he came and met us about eight months ago, Maran said.

 The chipmaker is yet to decide on the city that would house the facility. Chennai, Bangalore and Noida are in the running. Earlier, Intel had indicated that the plant would require an investment of about $400 million.

 Intel had shortlisted India and China as two possible locations for the next manufacturing facility. Its decision to choose India should serve as a boost for the country.

 Intels decision would send a message that the global leader in chip manufacturing is satisfied with the infrastructure in India, which should encourage other companies.

 Intel, a $34-billion company, has a development centre in Bangalore. However, it does not have a full-fledged manufacturing plant in Asia, its fastest growing market. Currently, the company manufactures chips in the US, Ireland and Israel.

 Analysts have been sceptical that despite the countrys success in the software business, it would be hard for India to realise its ambition of becoming a technological superpower without a semi-conductor manufacturing industry.

 In view of the rapidly growing market in India, it is vital that the country develops a manufacturing base or it would be left holding a huge import bill for computer chips, most of which would come from China.

 Maran told the Intel chief that the government is focussed on manufacturing. He also explained to Barrett the various policy initiatives taken by his ministry to promote investment in IT hardware manufacturing in India.

 The minister said he has taken it upon himself to impress upon IT and telecom manufacturing companies to set up facilities in India.

 Maran, who has had success with telecom firms like Nokia and LG Electronics investing millions of dollars in the country, was upbeat about his current trip to the Silicon Valley.

 He said most of the companies he visited, including Cisco and Applied Materials, are considering India for expansion.

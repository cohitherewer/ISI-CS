 Sun Pharma sees new dawn

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 23: Sun Pharmaceuticals, sitting pretty with several money-spinners in the local market, is eager to get a shot in the arm in its overseas medicine sales.

 Driving the initiatives on this front will be its pumped-up research muscle and a promising generic portfolio.

 The Rs 1,306-crore pharmaceutical major will soon file an investigational new drug (IND) application with the US authorities for a new chemical entity (NCE) within the next two quarters. It is also working on two products in the area of novel drug delivery systems (NDDS). 

 Both are important for its research effort, and are key links in the plan to transforming itself into an international company with strengths in drug discovery. The firm largely relies on process/product patents now.

 The initiatives are expected to result in raising the contribution of international business to over 50 per cent from the current 40 per cent over a span of three years.

 Chairman and managing director Dilip Shanghvi said his company is on the prowl for a generic company, though active negotiations are not under way now.

 Shanghvi said the company would offer details of the new drug being discovered after the second phase of clinical trials. The risk of these products are fairly high. Its better not to create too much expectation and take tomorrows value today, the Sun Pharma chief explained.

 The optimism on international sales this year comes with high hopes on local growth rates, which are expected to be in the region of 15-20 per cent. The uncertainty over value-added tax (VAT), a major worry in the fourth quarter of last financial year, is now in the past.

 Sun Pharma has a strong presence in neuro-psychiatry, cardiology, gastroenterology and diabetology. These contribute around 70 per cent to its sales in the domestic market. Shanghvi said it was the companys wide portfolio that has cushioned it against uncertainties. 

 We have a large product portfolio. None of them contribute more than 5 per cent to the companys turnover. Moreover, we invest wisely, spend constructively and launch products regularly, he added.

 Analysts share Shanghvis confidence. Ajay Sharma of CLSA, for instance, has taken the stand in a recent research report that the company is well positioned to report a 20 per cent compounded annual growth rate in earnings.

 Our confidence in its profits remains high because of Sun Pharmas low dependence on the tough US generic market. Its lean cost structure also helps, he added.

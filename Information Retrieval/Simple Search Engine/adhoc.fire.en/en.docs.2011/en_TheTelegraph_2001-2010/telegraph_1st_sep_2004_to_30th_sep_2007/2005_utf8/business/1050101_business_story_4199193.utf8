 First BoP shortfall in four years

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 31: The country?s balance of payments (BoP) showed a shortfall of over $634 million in the second quarter this fiscal ? the first such instance in four years ? against a surplus of $7.52 billion in the first quarter. 

 The deficit in BoP is caused by rising import payments of crude oil, petroleum products and merchandise.

 The country?s current account saw a deficit of $6.42 billion for the period compared with a surplus of $3.16 billion in the first quarter. 

 For the first half of this fiscal, the current account deficit stood at $3.25 billion against a surplus of $2.19 billion in the corresponding period last year.

 According to the figures released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) here today, the trade deficit during April-September shot up to $17.44 billion compared with $9.35 billion in the year-ago period.

 ?Imports of POL (crude petroleum and products) were the key drivers of the surge in import payments with data of the Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI amp;S) indicating a rise of 58.1 per cent in the second quarter from 57.6 per cent in the first quarter,? RBI said.

 The sharp rise in POL imports reflected the impact of the elevated levels of international crude prices in the second quarter and an increase of 12.7 per cent in volume up to August, the central bank added.

 RBI said exports during the first half grew 23.21 per cent to $34.45 billion ($27.96 billion) while imports were higher by 39.07 per cent at $51.89 billion ($37.31 billion).

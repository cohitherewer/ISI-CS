 Dole burden on Assam gas project piles up

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 GET CRACKING

 New Delhi, Oct. 23: The Centre could end up shouldering a subsidy burden of up to Rs 3,146 crore on the proposed Assam gas cracker project, which it is keen to push through on political grounds.

 The Public Investment Board (PIB) of the finance ministry has recommended that the government should bear ?upfront? the entire subsidy required for setting up the project and this burden should not be passed on to GAIL, ONGC, OIL and Numaligarh Refinery (NRL). 

 While GAIL is entrusted with the task of setting up the project, ONGC and OIL will supply natural gas and NRL will provide naphtha ? the inputs to produce polymers.

 According to petroleum ministry sources, the subsidy burden of the project on the government may vary between Rs 852 crore and Rs 3,146 crore, depending on the polymer prices and the cost of naphtha and natural gas that will be used as feedstock.

 Though the finance ministry is firm that the project is not financially viable, it has been recommended for approval by the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) for political reasons. 

 The PIB reconsidered the project proposal after the PMO intervened. The central government, which has signed an MoU with the Assam government to implement the project, does not want to be seen as going back on its words.

 Presentations on the likely rates of return and government subsidy will be made before the CCEA. Current estimates put the project?s internal rate of return at 10 per cent at a polymer price of Rs 40,000 per tonne. 

 The cost of capital for GAIL to set up the project has been worked at around 12 per cent. This may put the gas utility under financial stress. 

 The finance ministry feels that the project is highly capital-intensive and will provide little scope of direct employment for the local people. 

 The Planning Commission, however, feels the project can create one lakh jobs by setting up about 500 plastic processing units based on the polymer produced by the gas cracker and the development of allied services sectors. 

 The finance ministry?s argument is that the local offtake of polymer, which is projected at a mere 12,000 tonnes per annum, can easily be brought from outside to develop small-scale industrial units in the region, instead of setting up a financially non-viable gas cracker complex. 

 OIL is willing to supply natural gas for the project at Rs 1920 per thousand cubic metres compared with the Rs 3200 per thousand cubic metres that it is currently raking in from the market.

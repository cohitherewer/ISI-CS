 Out of this world

 New Delhi, May 24: Planet Hollywood, famous for providing dine-in experiences with the worlds best known filmstars, plans to invest close to $15 million to set up five restaurants in India by 2010.

 These restaurants will feature some of Hollywoods biggest stars. 

 For its foray into the Indian market, Planet Hollywood has signed a master franchisee agreement with the US-based Arch Millennium Corp, which is promoted by a group of non-resident Indians.

 We plan to open one restaurant each in Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Goa and Hyderabad, said Siddharth Mobar, president and chief executive officer of Arch Millennium.

 He added it would take approximately $2.5-3 million to develop a restaurant. The first one will come up in Mumbai early next year, Mobar said.

 Keeping with its name, Planet Hollywood restaurants will fly in famous filmstars and personalities from the West and sell Hollywood memorabilia and merchandise.

 We will bring big stars such as Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone to India as part of our promotional activities. We are also trying to get others like Paris Hilton and Justin Timberlake, said Mobar.

 The restaurant also has Hollywood stars on its platter ? its variety of dishes are named after the famous silverscreen stars. On Indian shore, the restaurateurs plan to add the local flavour by roping in some of the Bollywood stars at a later stage.

 Yes, certainly. It is something which is on our mind, Mobar said when asked whether the company planned to involve stars from the Indian film industry as well.

 Some of the unique dishes which will be on offer include chicken crunch based on Hollywood lady Demi Moores recipe and banana strudle made according to the recipe of action hero Arnold Schwarzeneggers mother.

 We will also be displaying and selling Hollywood movie merchandise, Mobar said adding that this contributed about 10 per cent of revenue of each restaurant worldwide.

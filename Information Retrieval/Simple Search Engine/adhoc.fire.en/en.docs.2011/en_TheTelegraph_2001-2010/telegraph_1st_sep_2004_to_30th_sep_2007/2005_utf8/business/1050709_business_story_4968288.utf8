 Oil prices near record high

 London, July 8 (Reuters): Oil prices headed back towards record highs on Friday as financial markets shrugged off the impact of Londons bomb attacks and a hurricane approaching the US Gulf oil facilities.

 The imminent resumption of talks by Opec to consider raising output for the second time in a month did nothing to check price gains. 

 The US crude for August delivery rose $1.02 to $61.75 a barrel and London Brent gained 94 cents to $60.26 a barrel. The US crude hit a record $62.10 in early London trade on Thursday.

 Oil prices have advanced to successive new highs on the perception that global economic growth has not been significantly slowed by inflated energy costs.

 Analysts said the attacks did not look likely to have the impact on the world economy seen after the September 11 attacks on the US in 2001.

 The London bombings are unlikely to cause as deep a disruption in oil demand. They (oil price rise) occur against the backdrop of a UK and global economy that remain strong, said Antoine Halff, director of Eurasia Groups Global Energy practice.

 Economists say that while oil prices have helped trim world gross domestic product growth from last years unusually strong 5.1 per cent increase, there is no sign yet of a slowdown.

 A Reuters poll of 22 strategists at major banks, released on Friday, had a median forecast for world growth of 4 percent in 2005, slightly higher than a similar poll in January. 

 It is slowing compared to last year, which was an exceptionally strong year, but ... its like a soft landing, said Jose Alzola at Citigroup in London.

 We expect the US and China to continue to lead global growth, with the US being largely the engine of global demand growth, said Maxine Koster at CSFB in London.

 Strategists said if oil prices remain at around $60, they could shave 0.1 to 0.2 percentage points off growth forecasts. If the oil price is $60 because demand pressures are stronger than you anticipated, it doesnt have much impact at all on your bottomline, said James Shugg at Westpac in London.

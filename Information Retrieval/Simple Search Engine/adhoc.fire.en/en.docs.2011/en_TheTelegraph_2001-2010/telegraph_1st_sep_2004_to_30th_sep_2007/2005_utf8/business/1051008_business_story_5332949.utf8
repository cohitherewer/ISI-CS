 Calcutta, Oct. 7: Air Deccan plans to sort out the problem of repeated delays and flight cancellations in six months.

 It plans to induct 60 new Airbuses and ATRs in as many months to ease the pressure on the present fleet.

 Air Deccan has six Airbuses and 14 ATRs in its fleet at present. To connect new destinations, the carrier has stretched itself, giving rise to delays and cancellations.

 ?We are aware of this fact and the carrier is trying its best to improve its performance,? chief revenue officer and commercial head John Kuruvilla said.

 Admitting that such incidents have tarnished the perception of the airline among users, he said the situation should improve by the end of this financial year.

 Deccan has roped in Warwick Brady from Ryanair of Europe ? another low-cost carrier ? as the chief operating officer last month with the mandate to fix up the problem.

 Meanwhile, Air Deccan has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Board of India to tap the capital markets to fund its expansion plans.

 Kuruvilla, however, refused to comment on the size and time of the IPO.

 The airline is also planning to increase fares at the upper slab in a couple of days in line with the rate hike of other domestic airlines, he added.

 Air Deccan connects 33 destinations with 160 flights. It carries about 10,000 passengers a day. It has about 11 per cent market share in the country.

 With additional planes, the airline will have spare aircraft to manage emergency situations.

 ?All our flights are tightly connected and delay in one destination leads to a chain reaction delaying subsequent flights. A spare aircraft would ease the situation in case of major delays,? Kuruvilla said.

 Air Deccan has also hired a hangar in Chennai to carry out major repairs. It has tied up with Honeywell for avionics and Rolls Royce for engine upkeep.

 ?We have given the job to people who are best in the business. So things should improve soon,? he added.

 Moreover, the low-cost carrier is stressing on schedule management so that there is enough time between two flights. The airline is using 80 per cent capacity during peak season and 75 per cent in the off peak season.

 Hind Petro pact

 Air Deccan has partnered with Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) for ticket distribution. At present, 140 outlets are selling Air Deccan tickets. The number of such outlets will go up to 2,000 in the next two years. Ticket sales from these outlets are hovering between Rs 3,000 and Rs 7,000.

 Bengal plan

 Air Deccan hopes to connect 10 more destinations from Calcutta. The company, which is expected to record a Rs 1,000-crore turnover this year from Rs 350 crore last year, will touch Patna, Ranchi and Silchar.

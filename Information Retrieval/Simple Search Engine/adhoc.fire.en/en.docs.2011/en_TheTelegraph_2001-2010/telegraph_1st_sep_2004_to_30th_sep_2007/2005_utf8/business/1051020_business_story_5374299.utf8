 Insurance suitors tap AllBank

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Oct. 19: The Principal Financial group of the US, Aditya Birla group and ICICI Bank are interested in becoming partners in Allahabad Banks general insurance foray.

 Three private insurance companies from Singapore have also made a presentation to the bank to become partners in the insurance business.

 Bank sources said there has been a round of talks with prospective partners on Tuesday. However, the partners have not yet been finalised, sources added.

 The bank will take the final decision on October 27 in Mumbai when there will be another round of discussion with the prospective partners. The bank will also discuss with the Reserve Bank of India regarding the partners.

 The bank will float a general insurance company by December 31, 2005.

 Two public sector banks ? United Bank of India and Union Bank ? have also evinced interest to join hands with Allahabad Bank to make a foray into general insurance.

 Sources said the top brass of Allahabad Bank is keen to rope in the Principal Financial group as its joint venture partner. The bank has recently tied up with Principal PNB Asset Management Company to sell its mutual fund products.

 Established in 1879, the Principal Financial group offers businesses, individuals and institutional clients a wide range of financial products and services, including retirement and investment services, life and health insurance, through its different companies. Principal is present in India through the asset management company.

 A section of the insurance industry, however, feels that the Aditya Birla group can also emerge as the joint venture partner.

 The Aditya Birla group is already present in life insurance through Birla Sun Life. The group also has Birla Insurance Advisory Services (BIASL) in its fold, which is a leading intermediary in general insurance market, licensed by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority. BIASL has tie-ups with all the public and private sector insurance companies in the country.

 ICICI Bank is already present in both life and non-life insurance through ICICI Prudential and ICICI Lombard respectively. Sources said they may pick up a minority stake in the venture.

 Allahabad Bank is planning to kick off its maiden general insurance venture with a Rs 100-crore kitty. The bank along with its fully-owned subsidiary Allbank Finance will together own less than 50 per cent stake in the joint venture.

 Calcutta, June 27: Bata India Limited has undertaken initiatives to improve the company?s cost structure and margins.

 The company has initiated a financial restructuring exercise to bring down its interest cost on loans by as much as 2 per cent from 9 per cent to 7 per cent.

 The financial re-engineering will also involve loan swapping and paying off high-cost short-term loans with the proceeds of the rights issue.

 Simultaneously, Bata India has decided to aggressively sell its products in the rural areas to increase its revenues and marketshare.

 The company has also tightened controls on costs in all areas of purchasing and outsourcing and is looking at global sourcing for raw materials and other inputs, chairman P. M. Sinha said while addressing the shareholders at the 72nd annual general meeting.

 Bata India is also exploring third-party manufacturing units in Assam and Jammu amp; Kashmir as these enjoy tax holidays. 

 The company will offer another round of voluntary retirement option to its employees and hopes to separate as many as 800 staff. 

 At present, Bata India employs around 9100 people at its shops and manufacturing units.

 Last year, the company separated around 1469 employees at a cost of Rs 32 crore, while around 28 crore would be amortised for the next five years.

 Sinha also expected margins to increase by as much as 20 per cent as a result of a multi-pronged strategy undertaken.

 Bata Shoe Organisation (BSO) has decided to give a breather to its 51 per cent subsidiary by foregoing the technical collaboration fee it used to pay to the parent.

 Sinha said, ?Bata India and BSO have mutually decided that the former would not be paying any collaboration fee to the latter until Bata India returns into the black. We will resume payment of the fee once we are in a position to do so.?

 Regarding marketing in urban areas, Sinha said, ?Bata India has also initiated the process of making its presence felt in super markets and malls. quot;

 Demerger on hold

 Bata India has dropped its plans to demerge Mokamaghat and Faridabad units into separate entities.

 Sinha said, ?Now that we have decided to put the demerger plan on hold, we would work out restructuring packages for these two units.?

 Bata India had earlier decided to demerge the two units and had also obtained shareholders? approval but unfavourable ruling from the high court has forced the company to shelve the plan.

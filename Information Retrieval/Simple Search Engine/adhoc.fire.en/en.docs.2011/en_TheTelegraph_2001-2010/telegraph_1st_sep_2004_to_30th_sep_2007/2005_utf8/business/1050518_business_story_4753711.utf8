 Ministry, panel at odds over pension 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 17: The finance ministry explained the nuances of the new pension system (NPS) to the members of the standing committee on finance at a meeting today, but the two sides remained at odds on the most contentious issues.

 There was certainly a lack of communication between both sides. The major issue discussed in the meeting was the nature and character of the NPS, said sources present at the meeting.

 The standing committee is scheduled to meet the trade unions tomorrow to seek their views. It will then meet other experts in this field as an ongoing process.

 Though the finance ministry explained how the new pension system would cover both the civil servants and the workers in the unorganised sector at the same time, the committee members reportedly were not convinced.

 This proposition cannot work. Employees in the unorganised sector will not be able to take advantage of this scheme because it is difficult for them to make informed choices on investment. It is difficult for them to understand anything about finance, said a standing committee member.

 The new scheme promises to give the pensioners the freedom to exercise their choice on where to invest their money. The government has already approved three investment options under the scheme ? safe, balanced and growth.

 On the contrary, the finance ministry argues that the idea is to give a wider choice under the NPS which is not available at present.

 With the central and state governments continuously claiming that their pension liabilities are becoming unmanageable, the committee member said, We do not buy the explanation. We must know the actuarial calculations on this basis of which the government is making such a claim.

 Averse to the private sector coming in to the pension business, the Left believes that the government should set up a fund and invest the money in their own long-term projects. 

 A Left MP argued, Why should any profit go into private hands. The new system proposed is untenable.

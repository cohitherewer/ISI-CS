 Job cut fuels HP quarterly earnings

 Future perfect 

 San Francisco, May 18 (Reuters): Hewlett-Packard Co on Tuesday posted a 9 per cent rise in quarterly profit as the No. 2 computer maker cut jobs and saw higher revenues across all its businesses. 

 Shares rose nearly 4 percent in after-hours trading after the results met Wall Street expectations. 

 Chief executive Mark Hurd, who took the helm in April after the February ouster of Carly Fiorina, signaled that further job cuts are likely. Nearly 2,000 have been cut in the printer division, where profit fell on related charges and pricing competition. 

 Everyone knows that the company has a tough road ahead, said SG Cowen analyst Richard Chu. But he said results were solid and should help lift HP stock, alleviating concerns even in the absence of much-anticipated new restructuring plans. 

 Hurd also ruled out a quick breakup of HP, something that many analysts and investors continue to call for. Im not working on spinning off anything, at least at this moment, Hurd told reporters on a conference call. 

 Whats clear to me already, even at this early stage, is that hard work lies ahead of us if we are to get HPs overall financial performance where it needs to be, Hurd told analysts on a separate call. 

 HP net income rose to $966 million, or 33 cents a share, for its fiscal second quarter ended April 30, from $884 million, or 29 cents a share, a year ago. 

 Revenue rose 7.2 per cent to $21.6 billion from $20.1 billion. 

 Excluding items, HP posted a profit of 37 cents a share, a penny ahead of the average estimate, and revenue also slightly topped expectations. 

 Shawn Campbell of Campbell Asset Management, which owns HP shares, said the results looked good compared with quarterly earnings reported last month by rival printer maker Lexmark International Inc that fell short of analysts expectations. 

 Considering what Lexmark did, I consider this a win for Hurd and Hewlett-Packard, he said.

 For the current quarter, HP forecast revenue of $20.3 billion to $20.7 billion and earnings per share before items of 29 cents to 31 cents, while analysts expected 32 cents a share earnings on revenue of $20.4 billion. 

 HPs operating profit in its mainstay printer business fell 14 per cent from a year ago to $814 million, reflecting $71 million in work-force reduction costs, lower prices and a trend toward sales of lower-cost toner and ink. Revenue at the unit rose 5 per cent to $6.4 billion. 

 Chief financial officer Bob Wayman said HP would break out severance charges in different parts of its business as its trims jobs and reports future results. Chu said that made clear more cuts were planned. 

 As for HPs future, Hurd said the company would provide details as soon as our plans are finalised.

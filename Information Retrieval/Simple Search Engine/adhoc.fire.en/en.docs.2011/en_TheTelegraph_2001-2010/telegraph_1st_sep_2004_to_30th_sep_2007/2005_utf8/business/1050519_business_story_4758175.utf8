 China permits trading in foreign currencies

 Shanghai, May 18 (Reuters): China launched a foreign exchange dealing system on Wednesday that allows domestic trading in currencies other than the yuan, a milestone in the countrys effort to reform its tightly controlled currency regime. 

 The system, allowing trade in eight more currency pairs, went live hours after Washington sounded its harshest warning yet on Beijings rigid forex policy, saying the country could be labeled a manipulative trading partner unless it took swift steps toward a more flexible yuan. 

 China shot back on Wednesday by saying such charges were unreasonable. Economists say the new trading platform ? which does not involve yuan trading ? is itself a step toward a more flexible yuan. 

 The China Foreign Exchange Trade Systems (CFETS) new platform hosts trading in the dollar against the euro, yen, Hong Kong dollar, pound, Swiss franc, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, plus the euro versus the yen. 

 Officials have assembled a line-up of foreign and local banks to launch the system, from ABN AMRO to Bank of China, but economists are divided as to whether the market will attract the business it needs to take off long-term. 

 Some analysts say trade will be lively so long as the opportunity exists to earn a profit, but others say the system may be constrained by a lack of foreign participation. 

 Bankers said a number of trades had gone through the system within minutes of its launch. 

 Our aim was just to test the waters, and try and grab a leading position in this, a Beijing-based bank dealer said shortly after the system went live. We dont know whether we can make any money though.

 Financial markets had looked to the launch of the system as a time when Beijing might make a long-anticipated move to revalue its yuan. In a rare public denial last Friday, Chinas central bank governor dismissed such reports as incorrect. 

 China, whose currency has been pegged near 8.28 per dollar since the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis, has faced pressure from the United States and other countries to let the yuan appreciate as they say it is unfairly cheap at current levels, giving Chinese exporters an advantage in world markets. 

 Beijing has vowed to free up the yuan according to its own timetable and has said reform of its banking system ? sagging under more than $200 billion in bad loans and one of the weakest links in its economy ? is a key prerequisite. 

 Treasury secretary John Snow said on Tuesday the United States was calling on Beijing to take only an intermediate step toward flexibility, saying that Chinas banks were not yet ready for a full float. 

 I believe they (Treasury conclusions) are not reasonable, Chinese commerce minister Bo Xilai said. 

 Chinas new currency trading system is partly aimed at preparing its banking community for a more flexible, market-based environment, by allowing homegrown lenders to gain experience trading currencies other than the yuan. 

 It sits alongside a decade-old platform that allows trading of yuan against the dollar, euro, yen and Hong Kong dollar.

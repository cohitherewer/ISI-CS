 SAIL to focus on special steel

 Calcutta, Feb. 20 (PTI): Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) is formulating a corporate plan for its special steel businesses, which is likely to be ready by next month.

 ?The three special plants ? Alloy Steel (ASP), Salem Steel (SSP) and Visvesvaraya Iron and Steel (VISL) ? have shown encouraging performances in recent times. SSP and VISL are all set to achieve profitability, while ASP has cut down its losses substantially,? SAIL sources said.

 Each special steel plant is formulating a growth plan for itself up to 2011-12. It would then be incorporated into SAILs corporate plan 2012, the sources said. The exercise of formulating a corporate plan for the company?s special steel business was likely to be completed by March, the sources said.

 The total loss of these three plants, which had touched a high of Rs 490 crore in 1999-2000, had come down to Rs 250 crore in 2003-04. Their loss was expected to further come down to around Rs 150 crore by the end of the current financial year following intensive efforts to increase operational efficiency and reduce costs, the sources said. SAIL was now looking to implement a slew of measures for further improvement in performance by these plants so that they could be turned around and functioned as individual viable units in future.

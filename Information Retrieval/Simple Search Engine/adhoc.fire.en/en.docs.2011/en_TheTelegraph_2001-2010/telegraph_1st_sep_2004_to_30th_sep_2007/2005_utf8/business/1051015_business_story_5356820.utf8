 Calcutta, Oct. 14: Weary of footing the electricity bill for the air-conditioner at your plant and office?

 Worry no more. Blue Star Ltd, the countrys largest commercial and central air-conditioner manufacturer, is promising to reduce your burden.

 Blue Star says it can cut down electricity costs by 15-20 per cent on an average by installing energy efficient products. The payback period on the investment made by companies to upgrade their existing systems to energy efficient ones could be 1-3 years.

 The development of energy efficient products is significant as AC power costs exceed the initial cost in about two years. For room ACs, the power bill shoots past the initial cost in one year.

 By adding auxiliaries and energy saving gadgets in plants, which will be installed and managed by us, there could be good savings, said Satish Jamdar, executive director of Blue Star Ltd.

 The company has made substantial investments to develop the energy efficient products. We are doing R amp;D in a big way. We have applied for a patent, he added.

 The company is carrying out energy audits of various firms and suggesting remedies to cut power costs.

 Blue Star believes such innovation will help it retain the leadership status. It had posted a turnover of Rs 930 crore in 2004-05, up from Rs 716.06 crore in 2003-04.

 During the period, central ACs, the companys flagship business, grew by 36 per cent.

 Jamdar said Blue Star is hoping to maintain a 30 per cent topline growth this fiscal as well. It will continue to focus on industrial customers and stay away from the domestic segment.

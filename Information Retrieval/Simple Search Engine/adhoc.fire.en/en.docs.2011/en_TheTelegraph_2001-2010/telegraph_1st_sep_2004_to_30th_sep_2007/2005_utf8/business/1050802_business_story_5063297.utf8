 Fiats Kurla plant hit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Rough ride

 Mumbai, Aug. 1: The manufacturing operations of Fiat Indias Kurla plant have been badly affected by the torrential rains since last Tuesday.

 The plant makes petrol and diesel versions of the Palio, the Petra and the recently-launched Adventure. The company has been going through a rough patch with its vehicle sales plummeting because of concerns over fuel efficiency. While the plant can manufacture 60,000 cars annually, the company was selling an average of 200-300 units early this year.

 Fiat today said its manufacturing operations at Kurla were severely affected due to the floods.

 Even though a company spokesperson was not available to comment on the losses accruing from the floods, a Fiat statement said, Kurla was the most badly affected area. As the Fiat plant is in Kurla, its manufacturing operations were affected to a major extent, but the assessment of damages is still under way.

 The company was working towards restoring operations, but it largely depended on the availability of electricity in the region. 

 Fiat also said efforts are being made to supply spare parts to customers on time.

 The company has also set up special commercial communications centres for dealers and customers to avail of spare parts and cars on time.

 The Mumbai rains have been an unfortunate calamity for all of us. To ensure smooth services for customers, we have set up a system wherein each of our dealers can contact us to register their requests and place orders for spares so that necessary action can be taken on time, managing director Paolo Castagna said. 

 Starting from Monday, we will restore the shipment of spare parts and clean up the backlog of request of the last days, the company said.

 Observers said details about the losses incurred will be known only towards the end of this week provided the weather conditions improve.

 Customer care

 Hyundai and Tata Motors have come forward to help their customers who are affected by the deluge in Mumbai. 

 Hyundai Motors India has decided to offer a 50 per cent discount on the MRP of spare parts and repair charges. Even customers who claim insurance would be able to avail of a 50 per cent discount on charges, which are not covered by the policy. 

 Tata Motors has directed dealers to toe cars expeditiously if they are stuck. It has also decided to provide spare parts to Tata cars at cost price.

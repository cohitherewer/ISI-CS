 India Inc sees faster rate of growth

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 25: The business confidence index is at its 10-year peak riding on the back of a strong monsoon, economic think tank NCAER said today.

 In its quarterly review, the National Council of Applied Economic Research (NCAER) said the business confidence index grew by a half percentage point from the January level to 143.1 in April. Higher consumer demands and export orders would drive the industrial growth, it said. 

 India Inc anticipates a faster growth rate due to liberal trade pacts with Singapore, lower interest rates, relaxation of FDI caps, improved macro-economic parameters, besides higher levels of industrial efficiency. 

 According to the report, 6.9 per cent GDP growth recorded in the previous year and chances of a higher industrial demand this year induced by the monsoon have contributed to this. 

 Huge FII inflows and promises of easier rules governing business, apart from rosy plans like gas pipelines, have helped boost the investment climate here, said Prof S.P. Gupta, former member of the Planning Commission. 

 He pointed out that confidence levels are reflected even in real estate and commodity markets. Whenever the economy is on an upswing, these markets normally rise up ... prices of real estate in all major metropolises have been pushed up by 10-20 per cent.

 The NCAER, however, points out that sales and production growth projections for the next six months do not reflect the bullish sentiment.

 The proportion of firms expecting sales to rise has gone down by 3.8 per cent compared with those in January. This could be because fewer manufacturing companies have reported order books of longer than three months. Also, production growth during the next six months is expected to be subdued, the NCAER said. 

 Long positions with white-good manufacturers, who have stocks piled up, is the real reason for lower expectations of production growth ... but sales forecasts to our understanding are better than before, said Saikat Sensharma, an equity analyst. 

 Prospects of exports for the next six months have gone up. The proportion of companies expecting higher exports is up by 2.9 per cent, the NCAER said. Even the outlook on pre tax profits is bright as the number of firms expecting higher profits has risen by 5.9 per cent, it added. 

 To sustain the industrial growth in the medium-to-long-term, the government will have to lift regulatory controls at the state level, just as it has done it at the central level, the think-tank said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Basell blame on Bengal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Purnendu: Thinking hard

 Calcutta, July 5: Purnendu Chatterjee has confirmed that he has ducked out of the Basell deal ? at least initially ? and feels that the Bengal government?s decision to deny him the right to leverage Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd (HPL) to fund the deal had sparked the sudden turn of events. 

 Purnendu had been told in no uncertain terms that he would have to buy out the Bengal government?s 36.87 per cent stake in HPL before he could bring the petrochemical company into play for the Basell deal. 

 The state government?s decision knocked a key prop off Purnendu?s funding plan and forced him to back out of the deal. 

 ?Initially I will not be in the deal. I will join Basell at a later stage,? Purnendu told The Telegraph over phone from New York. He is hoping to pick up a 30 per cent stake in the polyester giant from Russian-born oil magnate Leonard Blavatnik?s Access Industries. 

 The financial closure for the Basell deal is scheduled on August 1. 

 Blavatnik is now sealing the deal through his company Access Industries, which has worldwide interests in oil, aluminium and coal. The deal will be routed through Access subsidiary, Luxembourg-based Nell Acquisition Sarl. Nell was the code name for the Basell sale project. 

 John Stonborough, spokesperson for Nell Acquisition, said, ?Purnendu is out of the deal and we are going it alone.? He added that Purnendu had opted out of the deal ?some weeks ago?. 

 Stonborough said there was no understanding with Purnendu that would allow the TCG boss to pick up a stake in Basell at a later stage. ?That is pure speculation,? he added. 

 On Tuesday, the European Commission cleared the buyout deal for Basell. 

 Bengal government officials bristled at Purnendu?s charge that they had scuppered his chance of taking a piece of Basell. 

 Writers? Building sources said: ?Purnendu had met us last Wednesday, when he said that Access would first buy out Basell and then he will acquire 30 per cent in it. We have told him to bring in the money and take control of HPL at once. He is free to do so.? 

 Purnendu has paid the price for trying to swing two deals at the same time ? acquiring Basell and buying out the Bengal government?s stake in Haldia Petrochemicals ? without being able to put together the money for either. Purnendu now has to stump up Rs 1560 crore to buy out the Bengal government in HPL. He has three weeks? time to do so ? and it seems he will miss this deadline as well. 

 ?I have the money; I am stuck for clearances from the RBI,? he said.

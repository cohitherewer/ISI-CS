 Maruti hits price accelerator

 New Delhi, Oct. 3: Close on the heels of Hyundai announcing a price hike for its cars, Maruti Udyog today decided to charge more from its buyers. 

 Maruti has raised prices by 0.2-1 per cent on all its models except the Swift. It has cited increases in freight and input costs as the reason behind the raise.

 ?The hike is due to the increase in freight costs, which went up following the rise in oil prices. We have decided to pass on only a part of the burden to customers,? the company said in a release.

 The car-maker also said it would revise its vehicle prices a second time by the end of the year.

 The ex-showroom price of Maruti 800 standard will now be Rs 2,00,850, up Rs 1,500 from the earlier price of Rs 1,99,350. 

 Another large selling car from the Maruti stable, the Alto Lx, is now dearer by the same margin with its new price at Rs 2,79,408. 

 The company has increased the prices of Wagon R also by 0.7 per cent, or Rs 2,400. The Wagon R Lx will now sport a price tag of Rs 3,39,582 and its Lxi variant will cost Rs 3,66,892. Mid-sized Baleno Lxi now costs Rs 5,80,173, an increase of Rs 1,100.

 After the price revision, prices of Zen Lx and Lxi now stand at Rs 3,44,796 and Rs 3,71,619, respectively.

 Last week, Korean carmaker Hyundai Motor India also increased the prices of its two models ? the Getz and the Accent. While the Getz?s prices were increased by Rs 5,000-7,000 across variants, the Accent registered a hike in the region of Rs 7,000-Rs 9,000.

 A price increase was expected from Maruti. However, analysts believe that the quantum of hike is much lower than expected. 

 ?We expected an increase of around Rs 2,000 in the B1 category in the lower segment and around Rs 7,000 in the Esteem and Baleno category. But the actual hike is much lower,? said an auto analyst. 

 This also means that the pressure on Maruti?s margin will continue, and it will have to depend totally on the cost management for improving its margin.

 ?For the next three months, only the cost management will have to be taken care of as the input prices are going up,? said the analyst.

 A hike in input and freight costs could also see other carmakers announcing new prices for their cars. 

 Meanwhile, Maruti reported a 12.1 per cent rise in its sales for the month of September at 49,278 units against 43,949 units in the same month last year.

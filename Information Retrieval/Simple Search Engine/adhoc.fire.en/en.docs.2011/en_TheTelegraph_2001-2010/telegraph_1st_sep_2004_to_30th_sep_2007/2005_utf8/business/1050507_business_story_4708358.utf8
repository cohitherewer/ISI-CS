 IOC in Haldia stake rush

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 6: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), having paid Rs 150 crore for a 7.5 per cent stake in Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL), wants the shares handed to it quickly.

 The company stumped up the cash on February 18 through a cheque drawn on State Bank of India. The instrument, valid for six months, has not been encashed so far.

 Senior IOC officials said a letter asking for the shares to be issued was sent to HPL after the chairman of the oil company, Sarthak Behuria, met Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee during a recent visit to the state.

 Behuria had said that the state government and TCG, the two promoters of Haldia Petrochem, will have to decide whether they would like to bring Indian Oil on board.

 ?Indian Oil has told HPL to expedite the process of share issuance. We are looking into the matter,? Bengal commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said today.

 IOC is expected to wait for the shares till August, by when Purnendu Chatterjee could sign an agreement with the Bengal government to take control of Haldia Petrochem. 

 ?The Bengal government is watching how soon Purnendu will pay up and take control. If he does, the government will have to decide on inviting IOC to the company,? sources at the Writers Buildings said here today.

 IOC officials said they could look at more investments if they are ushered into Haldia Petrochemicals. The oil major has said in the past that it will convert HPL into a petrochem hub by pumping in Rs 5,000 crore.

 Basell funds

 Bengal wants to know Purnendu Chatterjees role in Basell Polyolefin before it allows Haldia Petrochemicals to invest in the Dutch petrochem giant.

 Sources said the state would like to be told about TCG chiefs holding, and how far can he leverage his Basell stake to market HPLs products globally. 

 ?We are evaluating TCG chiefs plan for HPLs investment in Basell. The government, as one of the promoters, will take a final call on it once it is placed before the board,? Sen said.

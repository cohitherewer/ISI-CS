 ONGC Andhra drill pays off

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, June 24: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation has made a significant gas discovery in the shallow waters of the Krishna-Godavri basin.

 The oil major today said gas was struck in a well drilled on the GS-15 prospect, located Southwest of the Ravva oilfield, which was discovered by ONGC in 1987. The site is around 12 kilometres from the Amalapuram coast in Andhra Pradesh. 

 The well was spudded on May 28 at a depth of 17.8 metres with a target depth of 2,500 metres. ONGC has indicated a significant hydrocarbon column or pay zone of around 45 metres at a depth of 1,684 metres to 1,760 metres.

 While most of the column is gas, the lower portion could yield oil, senior ONGC officials said. 

 The location was selected for drilling after evaluating the geological data with the latest 3D ocean-bottom cable seismic acquisition programme, which revealed that the prospect resembled the adjoining Ravva oilfield.

 ONGC has started the countrys first integrated deep-water development with smart-well technology in the G1-GS-15 area. The open architecture of this digital development technology will facilitate early production from the new field, once the appraisal is completed.

 The discovery has come as a welcome relief for ONGC as it was under fire for not achieving the requisite success rate. Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar has congratulated scientists and engineers of ONGC and exhorted them to accelerate the exploratory efforts.

 Aiyar has been criticising ONGC officials for not thinking out of the box and had rated the performance of Cairn Energy of the UK better as it had higher rate of success in striking oil and gas.

 Last fiscal, ONGC had made four hydrocarbon discoveries ? two each onshore and offshore. 

 Offshore fields VA-1 in the east and D-33 in the west are promising and the appraisal process is under way, a senior official said. However, the onshore finds are reported to be much smaller. ONGC will invest Rs 10,861 crore for oil exploration and production this fiscal, which is 56 per cent higher than Rs 6,852 crore spent last year. 

 The oil behemoth expects to win 10 out of the 20 blocks being offered under the fifth of the new exploration and licensing policy. These include three of the six-deepwater blocks, both the shallow water blocks and five out of the 12 onland blocks. Some of these blocks will be taken up in partnership with Cairn Energy. 

 ONGCs crude output was up marginally at 26.48 million tonnes in 2004-05 from 26.08 million tonnes in the previous year.

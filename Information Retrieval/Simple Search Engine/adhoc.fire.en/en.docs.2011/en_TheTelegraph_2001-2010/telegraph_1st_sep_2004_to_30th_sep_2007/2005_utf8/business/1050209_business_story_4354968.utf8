 Calcutta, Feb. 8: The Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) has urged chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to cut down procedural hassles to expedite investments in the entertainment sector, particularly multiplexes.

 According to Ficci president Onkar S. Kanwar, the state can immediately get an investment of Rs 200 crore in multiplexes if the procedural hassles are cut down and the industry gets the appropriate tax reliefs. This may go up to Rs 1,000 crore, feels Kanwar.

 Addressing newspersons after the Ficci national executive committee meeting here today, secretary-general Amit Mitra, said there are already six proposals in the pipeline for setting up multiplexes in the state. 

 ?However, there are certain problems which are acting a stumbling blocks to these investments. For running a multiplex, a permanent police licence is required. But the three multiplexes that are currently functioning in the city are working without permanent police licences,? he said.

 The three multiplexes currently in operation are: Inox Forum (on Elgin Road), Inox City Centre (Salt Lake) and 89 Cinemas (beside Swabhumi near Salt lake stadium). 

 According to the existing rules, the administration is entitled to collect entertainment tax from these multiplexes. But because of the absence of permanent licences, the authority is not collecting entertainment tax and subsequently the industry is not getting any exemptions.

 According to Mitra, the promoter of 89 Cinemas, Debasish Ghosal, is keen to set up two more multiplexes in the state, while Shravan Shroff of Shringar Cinemas is willing to set up another two.

 Earlier Kanwar said Ficci is willing to provide assistance to the state government in agriculture, horticulture and leather sectors. They have requested the Bengal chief minister to come up with a package for the farm sector to woo potential investors.

 Ficci has also come out with a nine-point action plan for Bengal. According to the apex chamber, the government should lay emphasis on information technology, tourism, farm and horticulture, transportation, education, healthcare, energy, plastic processing and exports.

 In the area of farm and horticulture, Ficci is willing to provide the necessary expertise. ?We have a Confederation of Food Trade Industries (CFTI), which can help develop the agri industry in the state,? Mitra said.

 In leather, Ficci can help the state in the vertical integration of the industry. 

 Ficci is also keen to closely work with the state on human capital development.

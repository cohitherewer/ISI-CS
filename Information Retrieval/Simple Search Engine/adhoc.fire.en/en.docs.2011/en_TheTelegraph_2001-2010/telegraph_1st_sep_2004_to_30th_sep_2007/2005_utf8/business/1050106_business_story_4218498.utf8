 Companies to pay global rates for ore

 In high demand

 New Delhi, Jan. 5: The steel ministry wants mining major NMDC to auction iron ore to domestic companies at international spot prices instead of the long-term prices it has been charging so far. However, it wants long-term pricing to continue for Japanese steel mills. 

 In a letter sent to NMDC chairman B. Ramesh Kumar, the ministry made it clear that it does not want iron ore to be sold to domestic steel makers at long-term fixed prices.

 Steel companies are scared as this would mean an increase in costs, which they may have to pass on to customers as NMDC has a virtual monopoly over supplies in the domestic market. 

 The ministry feels some private steel makers could be buying iron ore at reasonable prices and selling abroad. 

 Steel companies, however, say the ore is needed for their own plants. The ministrys directive states that Japanese steel mills, whose long-term contracts come up for renewal in 2006, should be allowed fixed prices.

 To get the Indian government to sell ore at long-term prices that are lower than international rates, the Japanese are keen to invest in developing Indian mines and set up rail and port linkages through soft loans. But unlike Korea?s Posco, the Japanese steel mills, which use a blend of high grade Indian iron ore and scrap metal to make steel, do not want to set up steel plants here. 

 NMDC is keen to set up its own pelletisation plant near the ports on the east coast so that it can extract a higher price for its output from both domestic and international buyers. The ministrys directive takes note of this and says it ?may also explore the possibility of setting up a pelletisation plant?.

 Cheap exports of high-grade iron ore to Japan have long been a sore point with most steel-makers in India. The domestic steel industry is expanding and would need high-grade ore, which is a scarce input the world over and should be reserved for domestic consumers, they said. 

 The two most scarce resources in the global commodity market are high-grade iron ore and good coal.

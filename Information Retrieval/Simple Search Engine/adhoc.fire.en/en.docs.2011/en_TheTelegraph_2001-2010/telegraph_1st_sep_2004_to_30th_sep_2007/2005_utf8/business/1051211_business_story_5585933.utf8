 Opec looks beyond winter 

 Kuwait, Dec. 10 (Reuters): Opec oil ministers were in broad agreement on Saturday that they should delay cutting output until high prices drift lower and the worlds big consumers are through the worst of winter. 

 Some in the group favoured meeting early next year with a view to trimming production from the current 30 million barrels per day (bpd) if prices have fallen and fuel stocks are high. One delegate said a 500,000-bpd reduction was possible. 

 Ministers were gathering in Kuwait to plot output through the first quarter of 2006, with the cost of a barrel of oil hovering around a 25-year-high in real terms and petrodollars pouring into the coffers of Opec exporters like Saudi Arabia. 

 I dont expect prices to drop in the next few days, a scenario that would also necessitate a drop in the Opec production ceiling in the upcoming meeting, said the United Arab Emirates energy minister Mohammed bin Dhaen al-Hamli. 

 But, speaking to reporters ahead of Mondays talks, he added: Oil prices (may) ease by the end of the first quarter of 2006 if the current production levels remain as they are. 

 The cost of oil has risen some 40 per cent since the beginning of the year and the worlds refineries have struggled to churn out enough gasoline and other fuels to meet the demand. Buying from China and India has helped drive a two-year rally.

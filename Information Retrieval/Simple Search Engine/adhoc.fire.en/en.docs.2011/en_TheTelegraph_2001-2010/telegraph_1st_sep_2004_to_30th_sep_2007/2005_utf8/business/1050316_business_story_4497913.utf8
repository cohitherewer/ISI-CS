 Opposition forces delay in patents bill 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, March 15: The government seems to have been forced to delay the introduction of the Patents (Amendment) Bill in Parliament due to stiff opposition from the Left parties and BJP.

 Commerce minister Kamal Nath today said the government would hold talks with both the Left and the BJP and he expected to introduce the bill in Parliament soon.

 ?I am sure that political parties are aware that the amendment is part of the country?s international commitment, which has to be honoured,? he said. The minister implied that he did not foresee any major problem ahead in this regard. 

 The government had earlier given an assurance that all views and concerns will be taken into consideration suitably before finalising the Patent (amendment) Bill, 2004.

 The government had earlier issued an ordinance in order to meet the country?s obligation under the TRIPS agreement of the World Trade Organisation, to amend the Patents Act, 1970 to provide for patent protection in all fields of technology with effect from January 1, 2005.

 The Left parties have expressed concern over the issue and have urged the government to use the ?flexibility? provided in the TRIPS agreement to prevent Indian firms from being adversely affected. It is also feared that the cost of essential life-saving drugs could shoot up if sufficient care was not exercised. The domestic firms have said the current provision in the law is not adequate to prevent this ?ever greening? of patents, which delays them from producing generic drugs on the genuine expiry of the patent.

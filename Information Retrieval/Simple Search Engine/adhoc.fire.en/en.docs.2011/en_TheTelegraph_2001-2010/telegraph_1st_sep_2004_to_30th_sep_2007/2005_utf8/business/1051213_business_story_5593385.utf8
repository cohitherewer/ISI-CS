 Ramsarup keen on Bengal unit 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 12: Steel-wire and TMT bar maker Ramsarup Industries Ltd is in talks with the Bengal government to acquire one of its units through the disinvestment process the state has undertaken. The company has been shortlisted through a process of competitive bidding and the discussion is on with the government for the proposed acquisition.

 CMD Ashish Jhunjhunwala declined to comment on the development as the company is entering the capital market with a public issue.

 I cannot make any comment as the Sebi guidelines forbid this, he said.

 Eyeing the power sector growth, Ramsarup Industries is setting up a structural steel mill to cater to the sector.

 The company has drawn up a Rs 120-crore capital expenditure plan that include expansion and modernisation of its manufacturing facilities.

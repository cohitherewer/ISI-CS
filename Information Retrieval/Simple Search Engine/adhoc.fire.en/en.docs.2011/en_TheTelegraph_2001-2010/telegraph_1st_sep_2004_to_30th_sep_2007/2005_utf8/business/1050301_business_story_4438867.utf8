The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Plastic money in favour

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL AND ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, Feb. 28: The proposal to tax cash withdrawals above Rs 10,000 from banks will increase transactions using credit and debit cards, feels the banking industry.

 Neel Chatterjee, senior vice-president, corporate affairs, regional head, South Asia, Standard Chartered Bank, said, ?The imposition of 0.1 per cent tax on cash withdrawals above Rs 10,000 is a move to bring about a check in the transactions made by individuals. This in turn will definitely result in an increased usage of debit and credit cards for transactions at merchant establishments.?

 He said the use of debit cards will be more pronounced as most people are wary of using credit cards.

 Chatterjee explained that payments made through financial cards are easily traceable and such a transparent system helps curb unaccounted transactions.

 Debit cards will see a good growth and will be pivotal in spearheading the dynamic performance of financial cards as the eligibility criteria are easily met. 

 Additionally, debit cards are more appealing as they prevent consumers from overspending.

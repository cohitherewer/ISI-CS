 New Fiat India chief

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 1: Giovanni De Filippis was appointed the new managing director of Fiat India after the sudden exit of Paulo Castagna.

 The entry of Filippis comes days after the company signed an agreement with Tata Motors to analyse the feasibility of co-operation across markets in passenger cars. This will encompass development, manufacturing, sourcing and distribution of products, aggregates and components.

 Filippis joined Fiat in 1992 as production manager at the Pomigliano dArco plant.

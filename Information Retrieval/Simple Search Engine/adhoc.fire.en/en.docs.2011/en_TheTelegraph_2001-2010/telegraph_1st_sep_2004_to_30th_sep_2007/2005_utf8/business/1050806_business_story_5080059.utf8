 IOC 

clamours for higher discounts

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Behuria: Demanding

 New Delhi, Aug. 5: Indian Oil Corporation wants higher discounts from Reliance Industries on LPG and kerosene it buys from the Jamnagar refinery. 

 IOC is losing Rs 92 per cylinder on the cooking gas and Rs 11 per litre on kerosene sales through the public distribution system. 

 IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria told reporters that Reliance should bear at least one-third of the subsidy burden. It is likely to buy 1.1 million tonnes of kerosene and 2.6 million tonnes of LPG from the private refiner during the current fiscal. 

 Last fiscal, IOC had purchased 3.5 million tonnes of kerosene and LPG from Reliance at a discount of Rs 150 crore, Behuria said. 

 According to the present import parity based pricing formula for petroleum products, domestic prices are higher than international prices as notional transport costs and customs duty are added on. Only in the last budget, the customs duty on kerosene and LPG had been reduced to zero. 

 Since it is a private sector company, Reliance is reluctant to get roped into sharing the subsidy burden of state-owned companies. 

 In fact, it is not keen to sell kerosene to national companies, as it can make more money by exporting the same as jet fuel. 

 Since only a minor change is required in the refining process to get jet fuel from kerosene, the cost of production of the two fuels is more or less the same and the products are similar.

 The petroleum ministry feels kerosene is an essential commodity used by the poor and exports should be allowed only after domestic requirements are met. 

 The import parity based pricing system helps refineries earn high margins on petrol, diesel and LPG. 

 Oil marketing companies, however, are at the receiving end, as they are not allowed to increase retail prices due to political compulsions.

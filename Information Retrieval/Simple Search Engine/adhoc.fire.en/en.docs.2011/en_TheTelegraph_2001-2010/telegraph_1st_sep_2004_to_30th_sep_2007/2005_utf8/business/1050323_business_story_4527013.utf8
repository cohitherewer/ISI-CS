 Ambanis in southern power play

 Mukesh: Different strokes 

 New Delhi, March 22: The central government wants to set up a mega power plant in south India and among those vying for a piece of the action are firms owned by the Ambani brothers. The gas-based plant, to be set up as a joint venture, is estimated to cost around Rs 8000-9000 crore.

 When power secretary R. V. Shahi called a meeting to discuss the bidding process for the plant, R. P. Sharma, who heads the gas division of Mukesh-controlled Reliance Industries as well as J. P. Chalsani, director of Reliance Energy Ltd and an Anil Ambani man, turned up. 

 The Centre wants the three large states in south ? Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh ? to join hands and float bids for the huge 3,000 mega-watt power plant, which may be housed either at Kakinada or Ennore. 

 The two Reliance entities are, however, not the only firms interested in the mega power plant. Other who are keen include state-run power giant National Thermal Power Corporation and private players Andhra Pradesh Genco and GVK Industries. 

 Executives close to Mukesh Ambani said ?the meeting was preliminary ... we are gas suppliers and could be interested in gas supplies. It?s too premature to say whether we would be keen on taking a stake.? 

 In fact, Reliance representatives said at the meeting that the company?s gas from the Krishna Godavari basin could be expected to be available only from mid-2008. The other possible sources of gas for the planned mega power station are Ravva and Annapurna and some ONGC fields.

 Power ministry officials said while Reliance Energy had been invited as a possible bidder for the project, Reliance Industries had been called as a potential gas supplier as had been GAIL. 

 However, the ministry felt that suppliers can very well become potential bidders ? independently or as part of any consortium.

 Anil Ambani controlled Reliance Energy is obviously deeply interested in the mega power plant ? it sent five senior executives for the meeting while most other firms and state governments were represented by just one or two officials. 

 The battle for the mega power plant is also likely to be keenly fought by NTPC. 

 C. P. Jain, the chairman and managing director of the thermal power company, personally attended the meeting.

 The meeting decided that two of the three options available are NTPC bidding alone to set up the giant plant or it forms a consortium with two or all three southern states as partners.

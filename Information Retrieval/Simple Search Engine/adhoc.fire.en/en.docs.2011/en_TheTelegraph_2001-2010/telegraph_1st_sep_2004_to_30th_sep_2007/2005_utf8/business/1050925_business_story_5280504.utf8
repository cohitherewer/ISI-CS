The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Telecom regulator wants firms to answer rural call

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Baijal: Reaching out

 Calcutta, Sept. 24: Telecom operators will have to reach out to the rural areas if the current growth in telephony in the country has to sustain.

 The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is likely to call on all the service providers within the next fortnight to draw their attention to the yawning gap in teledensity ? number of telephone connections per 1000 person ? between the rural and the urban areas. 

 Pradip Baijal, chairman, Trai, said, ?Operators will have to take steps to bridge the huge (teledensity) gap between the rural and the urban areas. We have to adopt policies that fuel growth of telephony in rural areas. Also, they should look at rural markets not as an obligation but as an opportunity.? 

 While the number of telephone connections per 1000 persons in urban areas is expected to grow from 22 to 31 this year, the teledensity in rural areas is stagnating at a mere two.

 ?The industry has to leverage the advantage of the huge prospective user base in the rural areas to grow. The operators must learn to look at the numbers as a market opportunity,? said Baijal. 

 ?Though the average revenue per user has declined to Rs 400 in 2005 from Rs 1,300 in 2000, the subscriber base over the same period has grown from 1.88 million to 52 million. The turnover of the telecom sector as a whole has increased from Rs 3,000 crore to Rs 25,000 crore in the last five years. This is the right time to enter the rural market as the entry barrier for handsets has also come down to $35,? he pointed out.

 In countries less developed than India, the network coverage is around 90 per cent. But, in India, it is only 20 per cent till last year.

 ?Operators have outlined plans to cover 4900 towns out of the total 5200. The expansion of telecom network in the country is currently under way. Last week, we had reviewed the network situation and found that 5000 towns have already been covered,? Baijal said.

 He also pointed out that while the number of cable connections in the country stood at 61 million there were only 47 million telephone subscribers. 

 ?This shows that the rural populace is hungry for access to information and entertainment from different sources,? he added.

 However, public-private partnership and appropriate price levels are the key drivers of sustainable growth in telephony in the country, Baijal concluded.

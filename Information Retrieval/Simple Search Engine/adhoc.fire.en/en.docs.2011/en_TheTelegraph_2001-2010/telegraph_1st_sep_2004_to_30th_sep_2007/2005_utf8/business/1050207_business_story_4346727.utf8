 India Inc roots for gas price regulator 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 6: Industry has suggested the need for a gas pricing regulatory authority as India is poised to see an exponential growth in natural gas utilisation over the next 20 years.

 Natural gas is expected to be the energy of choice by 2025. 

 In India, robust economic growth is expected to drive gas demand at a compounded annual growth rate of 5.5 per cent in the next 20 years. 

 ?There is a need for a regulatory framework to ensure transparency and eliminate misuse of the monopolistic powers,? says a study jointly prepared by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) and Gail (India) Ltd.

 At present, there is no single body providing the regulatory framework for natural gas wholesale pricing, transmission, distribution, supply and storage. There are no statutory provisions regarding safety, the focus being on self-regulation.

 The industry wants the regulator to promote investment in the development of pipeline networks and the early establishment of the national gas grid. Codes for technical and safety parameters as well as inter-connectivity of pipelines are also required to be developed for systematic growth of the sector, states the study.

 The study says in the emerging scenario, the biggest challenge facing gas companies would be marketing to a wide spectrum of customers at varied contractual obligations, while sourcing gas at differential terms from various sources.

 The paper underlines the need for efficient and reliable customer service. These include efficient supply management and accounting, meeting seasonal demands, ensuring supply security and providing value-added services.

 In India, demand in the domestic sector is mainly restricted to households where there is urgent need to establish customer service standards. 

 These include the need to minimise deposit for registration, efficient induction, complaint redressal mechanism, addressing of common queries and constant feedback.

 Investors want to be provided with exclusivity period in the gas distribution business to enable recovery of investment in the transition phase.

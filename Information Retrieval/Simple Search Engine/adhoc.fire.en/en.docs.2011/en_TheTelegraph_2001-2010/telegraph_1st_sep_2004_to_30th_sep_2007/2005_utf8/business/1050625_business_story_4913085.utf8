 This team in India is part of Carlyles Asia group, which manages a $750-million fund. The firm has two dedicated Asia funds with a corpus of $323 million. The firm now has seven investment professionals in India to suss out opportunities in buyouts and other forms of investments. They join a team of 57 investment experts throughout Asia.

 Apart from Gupta, the other members of the buyout team in India include Raj Dugar, former founding director of Merlion India Fund. While Dugar has been named director, Manoj Dengla was named senior associate. Dengla comes from Goldman Sachs, where he was an associate in the special situations group at New York.

 After his appointment, Gupta said there is an enhanced need for investment capital in India today and Carlyle can add tremendous value to build companies.

 Dugar revealed that the team is actively evaluating a number of buyout and minority investments in firms.

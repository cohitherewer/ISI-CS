 Calcutta firm buys Konark Jute

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Feb. 23: The Calcutta-based SB Overseas has decided to take over the ailing Konark Jute Ltd (KJL) for Rs 4.5 crore.

 The inter-department core group, chaired by industries secretary G. C. Pati, today accepted the takeover bid of KJL, a subsidiary of the state-owned Industrial Development Corporation Limited (Idcol). The management of SB Overseas has also agreed to shoulder a liability of Rs 14 crore, comprising provident fund, gratuity and salary arrears of 2200 employees of the company. The company has agreed to retain the existing employees of KJL. 

 ?The government would take a formal decision on Monday about the takeover bid,? Pati told The Telegraph. 

 While the earlier six major divestments have been limited to asset sale of the sick units, the current one is a takeover. 

 Besides SB Overseas, three other companies had bid for the jute company after Orissa High Court allowed the takeover of the company by its order dated December 17. 

 Earlier SB Overseas had quoted a price of Rs 7 crore, but did not want to shoulder the Rs 14-crore liability. After negotiations, the company agreed to take over the liability, but brought down the bid amount to Rs 4.5 crore.

 Located 70 kms from Bhubaneswar, the composite jute mill was incorporated in 1979 at Dhanmanadal in Jajpur district as a joint-sector company with National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Ltd (Nafed) as co-promoter. It later became a subsidiary of Idcol. Now it is operated privately by Sanatan Commercial Ltd under a leave and licence agreement. 

 It produces jute sacking, hessian and DW tarpaulin and has a capacity of 13,240 tonnes, 3940 spindles and 212 looms. Raw jute is being supplied from the Mahanadi-Brahmani delta.

 For the state government, the takeover bid by SB Overseas could not have been better as the other three bidders didn?t want to shoulder the liability. The takeover price is reportedly higher than the reserve price fixed by Idcol. 

 Sources said the recommendations of the core group would now be sent to the court. Since all undertakings have been referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR), the transactions have to be taken up in accordance with Orissa High Court. The high court would then pass an order in favour of the takeover following which the company will deposit the bid money with the government.

 Srei Capital Markets Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Srei International Finance Ltd, has been appointed adviser by Idcol for the KJL divestment. Srei Capital drew up the evaluation criteria and assisted in negotiations. 

 This is the seventh major divestment programme of the state government. The last programme saw the sale of Bargarh Idcol Cements, a subsidiary of Idcol. It was acquired by ACC in December 2003 for Rs 178 crore. Similarly, in May 2003, the loss-making Nayagarh Sugar Mill was sold to ECP Industries Limited for Rs 7.36 crore. 

 The other four undertakings that have been divested are also Idcol subsidiaries. SN Corporation Ltd was sold to Sundarama Fasteners Limited for Rs 8.50 crore, Aska-Baripada-Sonepur Orissa Spinning mill to Pekon for Rs 8.16 crore, Orichem Limited to the Vizag-based AS Steel Limited for Rs 9.12 crore and Idcol Piping Engineering Works Limited to Rajendra Mechanical Industries Limited for Rs 4.69 crore.

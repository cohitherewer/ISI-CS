 Old Mutual bids for Swedish insurer

 Hitting the deal street 

 Johannesburg/Stockholm, May 14 (Reuters): South Africas Old Mutual is in talks to buy Swedish insurer Skandia and create a financial services group valued at around $15 billion. A takeover of Skandia would be Old Mutuals largest-ever deal. 

 A swoop into Scandinavia would also mark a dramatic new departure for Old Mutual, which has no business in the region and has hitherto emphasised building up its small UK operations to reduce its reliance on the highly competitive South African market, where it generates over three-quarters of its profit. 

 Discussions are at an early stage and may or may not lead to Old Mutual making an offer for Skandia, South Africas largest insurer said in a statement. 

 On Wednesday, Old Mutual announced an acquisition in the UK. Though it was not paramount, conditions in the British savings market had become more attractive, said its chief executive Jim Sutcliffe. 

 Skandia, on the other hand, said it has not received any such proposal.

 Acquiring Skandia, which some analysts have said could be taken out at around 50 crown a share, would give Old Mutual a strong footprint in the UK, where Skandia is one of the fastest-growing life businesses. 

 Skandias British operations, which accounted for nearly 60 per cent of group profit in 2004, are the jewels in a tarnished crown. Analysts say the UK business is worth ?1.5 billion. 

 Once the darling of investors, Skandia was hit hard by falling stock markets and a scandal over excessive management bonuses and perks. There has been much speculation that the firm could be a lucrative acquisition target. 

 But some analysts and fund managers said Old Mutual would have to work hard to convince investors of the merits of such a deal. The group has around ?1 billion for acquisitions and would have to issue new equity and/or debt to fund a Skandia bid. 

 Its not immediately obvious why this should be an attractive deal for Old Mutual shareholders, said one UK-based investor. 

 One Johannesburg-based analyst said the Skandia talks jarred with Old Mutuals earlier comments. 

 Saying they are not making a UK acquisition and then making a Scandinavian one is a bit like speaking with a forked tongue. It would have to be at an astounding price and Old Mutual would have to weave some pretty impressive spin to justify this transaction to its shareholders, he said. 

 But analysts at Bear Stearns said a bid at around 50 crowns a share would likely be successful because Old Mutual could outsource Skandias back-office functions across the UK and continental Europe to its low-cost home base. 

 In our view, Old Mutual must be one of the few life insurance companies to have enough interest to bid for Skandia. Most other companies already have a well-established UK unit-linked business with distribution capabilities, Bear Stearns said in a note. 

 Most analysts said it was unlikely that Old Mutual would hold on to Skandias Swedish operations, which have been losing its market share. But a source familiar with the situation said Old Mutual wanted the whole business. 

 Skandia has effectively been up for sale for a while, but bankers said a formal offer from Old Mutual could trigger a bidding war involving trade and financial buyers. 

 I think counter-bidders will circle. A lot of people have been keeping a watch on Skandia. I suspect Old Mutual will try to get the deal done quickly before others can jump in, said a London-based investment banker.

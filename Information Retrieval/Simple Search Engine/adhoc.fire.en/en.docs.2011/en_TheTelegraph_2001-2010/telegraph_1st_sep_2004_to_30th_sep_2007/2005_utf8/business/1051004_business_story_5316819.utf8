 Public-private tussle in the pipeline 

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, Oct. 3: GAIL (India) has once again taken on Reliance Industries on the proposed pipeline project to evacuate gas from the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin.

 It has asked the petroleum ministry to review the permission granted to the private sector oil and gas company to lay the pipeline from the Andhra coast to Gujarat. 

 In its complaint to the ministry, GAIL has pointed out that despite the permission being granted over a year ago, Reliance has still not started implementing the project at the ground level. 

 It has also pointed out that while the ministry has always asked GAIL to furnish a proof of having firmed up the sale of 50 per cent of the gas to be transported through the pipelines before clearing the project, this condition has not been imposed on Reliance. 

 A senior Gail official told The Telegraph that the company has informed the ministry that Reliances deal with NTPC has not come through. Hence, it does not meet the criterion of having tied up with a customer for the gas. 

 The ministry had granted permission to Reliance Industries to lay the pipeline in accordance with a new policy, which threw open this business to the private sector. Until then, GAIL had enjoyed the monopoly of laying interstate pipelines in the country. 

 The governments rationale is, since private companies owned the gas they discover, they should be allowed to build their own pipeline networks. 

 Reliance had proposed to lay a pipeline from the Andhra coast to Gujarat via Goa, covering a distance of over 2000-km.

 GAIL has argued that government-owned companies have a monopoly over pipelines even in most advanced countries. These fall in the category of natural monopolies, as there are economies of scale in having a large pipeline network. 

 It also ensures that wasteful duplication does not take place, as several companies may lay overlapping pipelines, all of which will not be utilised.

 GAIL has drawn up a strategy to lay the national gas grid covering the entire country. Hence, it fears that if private companies are allowed in the business, the viability of the grid could be hit.

 The state-owned oil firm has also pointed out that it has been nominated to evacuate the governments share of the gas in the KG basin. 

 It has told the ministry that the cheapest way of evacuating gas from the KG basin is through its Hazira-Bijapur-Jagdishpur pipeline, which can be linked to the Andhra coast. 

 GAIL has said ultimately the high cost of transporting the gas will be passed on to power producers like NTPC, which sells electricity at a fixed price. Hence, either the consumer or NTPC will have to bear the burden.

 Stocks march to FII beat, scale new peak

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Dec. 19: Stocks soared past a new milestone today, the surge fuelled by a welter of good tidings on growth and the swelling tide of foreign funds.

 At the end of the share scramble, the sensex had shot up 110 points to a new closing peak of 9394.27. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) stepped up their tempo of purchases, pumping in more than Rs 2,320 crore in the first four days of last week. Local operators, too, have hopped on to the buyers bandwagon.

 The 30-share index turned strong after a weak start at 9263.32 and later rallied to a new intra-day high of 9402.68 before ending at 9394.27 against Fridays close of 9284.46, a net rise of 109.81 points, or 1.18 per cent. The BSE-100 index jumped 59.90 points to 4957.02; BSE-200 was at 1185.24 and Dollex-200 at 436.18.

 The buying by foreign funds has been spurred by prospects of higher-than-expected growth, which government estimates suggest, will be around 7.5 per cent this year. The figure will go up to 10 per cent in three years.

 Divestment moves in six profit-making non-navratna public sector undertakings and proposals to relax FII investment limits in state-owned banks are some of the planned reforms buoying the market.

 However, the rally bypassed Ranbaxy, which ran into a selling storm after a US court handed it a patent setback in a court battle the firm was fighting against Pfizer.

 Among gainers, Reliance, Infosys, ITC, L amp;T, Hind Lever, HDFC Bank, Satyam Computers, Bharti Tele-Ventures, Tata Steel, Hero Honda and SBI took big strides.

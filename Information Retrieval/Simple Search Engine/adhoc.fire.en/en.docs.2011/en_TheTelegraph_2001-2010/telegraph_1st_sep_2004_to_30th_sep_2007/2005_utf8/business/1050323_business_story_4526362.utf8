 Khaitan: Big plans

 Calcutta, March 22: Eveready Industries will set up a manufacturing unit for dry cell battery in Uttaranchal at an estimated cost of Rs 60 crore.

 The new unit, to be ready in two phases over the next 18 months, will have a capacity of 400 million. With this, Eveready?s total battery manufacturing capacity will touch 1.7 billion units.

 Eveready is the domestic market leader and third largest in the world after Matusushita and Energizer. The BM Khaitan-owned company has a 46 per cent market share in the country.

 Vice-chairman and managing director Deepak Khaitan said land has been acquired and work has started. ?In the next three years, we plan to take our capacity to 2 billion pieces,? he said. 

 The new plant, to be located in Haridwar, will get tax benefits. The company?s battery business grew by 15 per cent this year, while the industry grew by 12 per cent. In last five years, while the industry grew by 8-9 per cent (CAGR), Eveready grew by 12 per cent. In the next three years, it is expecting 35 per cent CAGR for the packet tea business, 15 per cent for battery and 25 per cent for torch.

 Distribution network

 The company plans to let its wide distribution network hawk other FMCG products. Eveready has a wide network reaching over 3 million retail outlets. 

 The company would hawk products in the beverage space, related to the core item tea. Moreover, it may also take up regional brands of other players and distribute nationally. Contract manufacturing is also a possibility Eveready is exploring. The company is close to finalising product lines. ?We will decide on this in the next few months,? Khaitan added.

 Products related to beverages may be sold under the Greendale brand. The packet tea portfolio, consisting of Premium Gold, Jaago, Tez and Classic, is sold under the Greendale brand. ?There are offers from many companies. We are looking at the options,? Khaitan said.

 Bulk tea demerger 

 The demerger of the bulk tea division of Eveready is now complete and the board has been reconstituted. Bulk tea (the plantation business) will now be vested with McLeod Russel India Limited. 

 Rediffusion chairman Diwan Arun Nanda has joined as a non-executive director and Suvamoy Saha as wholetime director and chief financial officer on the demerged Eveready board. R. Srinivasan and R. S. Jhawar have resigned as directors from demerged Eveready and will join the McLeod Russel board.

 Jolt to south tea auction

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Bitter brew

 Calcutta, March 28: The uncertainty over the implementation of the value-added tax (VAT) from April 1 has affected tea auctions in south India. A large quantity of tea, which was offered last week, has not been sold with prices ruling low.

 This has upset the tea industry in the south, which has been the worst hit (price-wise) in the last four years. 

 Officials said they might have to postpone the auction this week until VAT is declared in the southern states. 

 They said most of the buyers abstained from bidding, resulting in a large quantity of the total 10.07 lakh kg tea not being sold in the electronic auction held on March 17 and 18, trade sources said.

 Industry officials said the south Indian tea trade is being affected due to this uncertainty as they operate on thin margins.

 The auction centres in Bengal ? Calcutta and Siliguri ? however, did not witness any uncertainty as the state has already declared 4 per cent VAT. The tea trade in the north feels that they might witness some problem if certain states do not implement VAT after April 1. 

 ?The offerings at the Calcutta auction has remained low in the last couple of weeks. This forced us to drop sale 11 and 12 at the Calcutta auction. Since the availability is low, the auctions (Sale 13) did not continue for the full day today. Sale 14 will also be for half day,? a Calcutta Tea Traders? Association (CTTA) official said.

 In Bengal, tea will become cheaper for consumers. The buyer will get tea at 1 per cent sales tax in the auctions and then sell it within Bengal at 4 per cent VAT. Earlier, the buyer was getting tea at 1 per cent sales tax at the auction and reselling it within the state at a 7 per cent sales tax.

 ?Therefore, the buyer is now at a comfortable position and this will have a positive impact on the consumer price of tea,? the CTTA official added.

 At the south Indian tea auctions, orange pekoe was Rs 5 to Rs 10 easier per kg, while high-grown orthodox was Rs 2 to Rs 5 lower. CTC tea was sold Re 1 to Rs 2 cheaper.

 The tea prices at the north Indian auctions have not witnessed a slide.

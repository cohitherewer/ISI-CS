 SpiceJet gets global investors

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: Macritchie Investments, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sigapores Temasek Holdings, and Istithmar, the investment arm of the government of Dubai, will pick up a 6 per cent stake in low-cost carrier SpiceJet.

 Both these firms are strategic, long-term players with experience in investing in aviation firms ... it will be an asset to have them on board with us, said Ajay Singh, CEO of the Delhi-based airline, formerly known as Modiluft. 

 Singh said the two firms will bring in about $20 million, which will be used for aircraft acquisition. We also plan to float bonds within the next few weeks. The bonds should mop up $70-75 million.

 Sources added that Macritchie and Istithmar would probably be eyeing larger stakes in future.

 The investment would be made according to the pricing formula laid down by Sebi, a SpiceJet spokesman said here. 

 The airline would soon seek the required approvals, including shareholders clearance for the allotment of equity shares on a preferential basis.

 Macritchie has investments in Singapore Airlines, Singtel, DBS Bank. In India, it has stakes in ICICI, Matrix Labs, Tata Consultancy, M amp;M and Wellspun. Istithmar, whose first investment in India is in SpiceJet, also has a big global reach.

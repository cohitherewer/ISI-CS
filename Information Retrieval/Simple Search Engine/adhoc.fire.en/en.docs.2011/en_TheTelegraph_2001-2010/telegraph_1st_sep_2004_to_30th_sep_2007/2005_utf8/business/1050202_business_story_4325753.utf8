 Nortel local hub to service Europe, America 

 M RAJENDRAN 

 New Delhi, Feb. 1: Nortel Networks will expand the operations at its optical fibre lab in India and make it the hub to offer services for technical problems in optical fibre cable systems in Europe and North America.

 In the case of a leak in an optical fibre cable network in Australia or any other country in Asia-Pacific, the Indian techies will be able to dial into the network, reach the problem area, collect the data and analyse it at the lab in Mumbai. If it is a software problem, a patch is sent to seal it. If it is a hardware problem, then they can point out the place and ask the hardware experts nearby to provide the support service.

 John J. Giamatteo, president, Asia Pacific Region, Nortel, said, ?A big part of our increasing business focuses on services, which include technical service, enterprise project management, network management, network operation centres. We believe that India can absolutely serve as the centre of excellence to give technical, high-technology support to our customers in Europe.?

 ?This is not a call centre but a high-tech trouble-shooting lab for optical fibre cable systems from its centre in Mumbai. Currently, it supports thousands of networks in Japan and Korea with the help of highly technical support personnel from India,? said Giamatteo.

 Currently, the lab in Mumbai caters to the problems in Asia-Pacific and will be expanded to cover Europe and North America. 

 While Giamatteo refused to share the investment figures, he said, ?We had 20 people in the optical division that has gone up to 100 and this number would triple within the next few months.?

 ?We believe that each country in the region (Asia-Pacific) does have a special skill and we would like to leverage it. India has the best pool of highly skilled technical experts and thus services is its strength that synergises with our objective.? 

 Nortel is also eyeing big business opportunities in Chennai, Bangalore and Calcutta to target corporate houses interested in voice over internet protocol (VoIP) and other new emerging technologies.

 As a global company, Nortel Networks does business in more than 150 countries. The company has transformed and re-invented itself countless times, changing from a pioneering telephone manufacturer feeding primarily the Canadian market to one of the world?s leading global providers of wireless and optical networks and services for service providers and enterprises.

 Its Optical Long Haul Network develops and delivers optical technologies for long-haul backbone networks that support inter-city data and voice traffic.

 Nortel launched its business in India targeting the enterprise businesses then moved to research and development and later expanded to the supply of optical fibre. The major orders include projects from Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd and a pilot project based on global system for mobile communications railways (GSM-R) for Indian Railways.

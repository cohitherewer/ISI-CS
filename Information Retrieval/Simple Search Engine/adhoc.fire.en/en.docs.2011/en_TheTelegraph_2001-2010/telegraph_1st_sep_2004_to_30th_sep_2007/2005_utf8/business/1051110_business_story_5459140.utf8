 Selloff on, in small lots

 Mumbai, Nov. 9: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the government is looking at divesting a small portion of equity in profit-making public sector enterprises other than the navratnas.

 Chidambaram did not divulge the identity of these enterprises, but he told reporters at the sidelines of a conference that the government has discussed the possibility of divesting a small slice of equity in a few PSUs. 

 Observers see this move as a median path taken by the government with reform on one side and the need to keep Left parties happy on the other.

 ?We have had discussions on divesting small portions of equity in select profit- making public sector enterprises other than the navratnas,? Chidambaram told newspersons. 

 The government had to put off its decision for a partial divestment in Bhel after protests from the Left. The latter has been against the government selling its stakes in profit-making PSUs.

 Earlier, Chidambaram said the process of globalisation would depend on the determination of individual nations to push their reform agenda further. He pointed out that as developing nations allow capital investment to flow into their country, the developed countries must reciprocate this liberalisation by allowing free migration of human resources from countries like India.

 Responding to a query on the firm crude prices and the impact that it would have on inflation, Chidambaram said the pass-through of fuel prices would have an impact on prices. 

 He said the increase in fuel rates contributed about 60 per cent to the inflationary factors. The inflation rate, which is now at around 4.4 per cent, should be around 5 per cent by the end of the current fiscal. 

 ?The rise is unavoidable,? he added. 

 The finance minister assured that the trade deficit would be manageable at the current level as the government?s borrowing programme would be within projected levels. Moreover, the countrys external trade is expanding along with increased import of capital goods. 

 On the rupee?s slide against the dollar, Chidambaram said the Indian currency has been under pressure as the dollar has firmed up against all major international currencies and the fall in its value is not a cause of concern for the government. 

 However, even as it has lost its ground against the greenback, the rupee has appreciated against all other currencies such as euro, he added quickly. 

 Echoing the stand often taken by the central bank, the finance minister said he favoured an orderly function and two-way movement of currencies. 

 ?We have always said that orderly movements in both ways is acceptable. It is only disorderly movement which should cause concern,? he said.

 Earlier addressing the gathering, he said countries like India are worried about the rise in barriers to the movement of people to advanced nations.

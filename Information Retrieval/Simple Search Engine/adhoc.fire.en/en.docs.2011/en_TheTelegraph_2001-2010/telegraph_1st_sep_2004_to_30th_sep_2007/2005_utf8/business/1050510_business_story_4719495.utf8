 Foreign investment burst in ONGC

 S. P. S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, May 9: Foreign institutional investors and NRIs have increased their holding in upstream oil giant ONGC from 6.19 per cent to 8.13 per cent over the last year to take the value of their investment in the company to the Rs 10,000-crore-mark. 

 A senior ONGC official told The Telegraph, ?The 2 per cent increase in foreign holding is based on their perception of the long-term performance of the company.?

 The value of the ONGC scrip, which was hovering around Rs 750 per share at the time of the public offer last year, has surged to close at Rs 871.90 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Monday.

 Soaring crude prices have resulted in increased earnings for all upstream oil majors and this is reflected in their share price as well. After the divestment of the 10 per cent stake through the offer, the government still holds 74.1 per cent in the company.

 However, ONGC has to hand over a part of its profit to Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum as its share of the subsidy burden that the Indian public sector oil companies bear on selling kerosene and LPG at below market prices.

 Clearly, the FIIs see that ONGC shares are worth holding on to despite the fact that the subsidy burden drains part of its profit. ONGC officials contend that this reflects their faith in the inherent strength of the company.

 ONGC produces close to 30 million tonnes of crude oil every year and if the natural gas output is also included its daily output in terms of oil works out to a million barrels a day. 

 While the ONGC crude output has been largely stagnating at this level in recent years, the company has done well to acquire stakes in the giant Sakhalin I offshore oilfield in Russia and Great Nile oilfield in Sudan. Its gas discovery in Vietnam and 20 per cent stake in the huge offshore Myanmar oilfield have turned out to be good investments. 

 The three new oil and gas finds announced last week have come as an image booster for the company. ONGC officials are of the view that the oil find in the western offshore is located near the lucrative Mumbai High fields, and given the high-quality of the crude associated with the basin, this could turn out to be valuable asset.

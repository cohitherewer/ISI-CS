 Cr?me de la cr?me in budget

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Jan. 12: The Congress-led government is turning to the best Indian brains in global business to formulate its foreign direct investment policy in the run-up to the budget for this year.

 At the invitation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, top Indian business honchos, including Victor Menezes, vice-chairman of Citigroup and former CEO of Citibank, Indra Nooyi, CFO of Pepsi, and multi-billionaire venture capital czar Vinod Khosla, today held a closed-door meeting on the issue with an inter-ministerial group. 

 The group was headed by plan panel deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia. The meeting drew secretaries or their seconds from the ministries of industry, commerce, finance and external affairs.

 The nearly two-hour meeting focussed on the need for two things: set up huge special economic regions, as opposed to the current policy of small zones, where special labour and financial laws will prevail making investment easier, and avoid opening contentious areas to FDI.

 Singh is slated to hold a personal meeting with the invited Indian global CEOs tomorrow. 

 The plan, which emerged in the meeting, was to develop special economic regions with full global connectivity in terms of international airports, sea or land ports, networked cities and broadband access.

 ?The concept is we could pick up a whole area like south Maharashtra or say, two industrial districts of Karnataka for such a project instead of a small area like Noida or Kandla,? officials said.

 Special laws for SEZs, which treat banks operating there differently, and relaxed labour laws could be allowed in these regions. 

 The meet also decided that the government should concentrate on inviting FDI in areas where there is a political consensus on opening up as political discontent on any issue scares investors.

 Internal debate could go on in areas where there were differences, like in retail trade and insurance, and attempts made to resolve diverse views, but these investment areas should not be sold abroad. 

 Specific sectors like financial services, software and infotech services, biotech and pharmaceuticals were picked up as areas which could play a pivotal role in the new FDI thrust. The meet wanted investment success stories to be picked up and highlighted. 

 The Congress-led government has already decided it will be trying once again to push through higher FDI in various key sectors.

 In telecom, it wants to push through a plan allowing up to 74 per cent FDI.

 At present, 49 per cent FDI is allowed in the sector, and an earlier bid by the government to bring more money into telecom by raising this cap to 74 per cent was stifled by Left opposition. 

 Officials said a fresh note was likely to be brought in the first quarter of this year taking into account Left objections. 

 The Left parties had voiced fears that control of a vital sector like telecom, which has security ramifications, could pass into foreign hands.

 Officials said that rules which allow up to 74 per cent FDI in private banks in India through a creeping acquisition of 10 per cent every year are likely to be modified soon. This will see norms for quicker and easier takeovers, subject to approvals from regulators.

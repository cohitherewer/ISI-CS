 HDFC sets terms for rate rebates

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Home, sweet home 

 Calcutta, Jan. 31: HDFC is willing to finance construction at a concessional rate of interest if the builders sell apartments on the basis of carpet area.

 ?We can lower our finance rate by 50 basis points if the builders are ready to sell flats on the basis of carpet area and not on super built-up area,? chairman Deepak Parekh said at a session organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce.

 Parekh said there is confusion in the housing industry over the concept of ?area? and some unscrupulous builders exploit this ambiguity to the hilt.

 ?There is as much as 40-50 per cent difference between the super built-up and carpet areas,? added Parekh.

 The super built-up area includes the carpet and built-up area of the apartment and its proportionate share in the common spaces of the building, like lobby, staircase and elevator.

 The built-up area includes not just the carpet area but also that being occupied by the walls of your home. The carpet area is literally defined as the exact area within the walls of your home.

 The confusion arises because the definition of the super built-up area is left to the discretion of the builders. Some may even include the terrace, security room, electrical room and pump room.

 The total area of these ?extras? is taken into account and divided by the number of apartments in proportion of their sizes.

 Therefore, if you are given a quote for a 1,000-sq-ft apartment and the area referred to is the carpet area, you have a huge living space.

 If it is built-up area, you have lesser space and in case of a super built-up area, you compromise heavily on the living space. In fact, the actual carpet area may just work out to be around 600 sq ft.

 Parekh said a universal concept of selling flats on the basis of carpet area would bring about transparency and accountability in the housing industry.

 ?We had made the offer in Bangalore and one builder had taken it up. However, since we did not receive further response from other builders, we withdrew the offer,? added Parekh.

 Parekh said interest rates should remain steady till March after which it may move up again, perhaps by about 50 basis points.

 ?Over the next 4-5 years, the rates will move up by 200 basis points. However, it will never reach the historic high levels,? Parekh said.

 He explained that interest rate is the function of several factors such as liquidity, government borrowing, pick-up in the industrial sector and take-off in non-food credit.

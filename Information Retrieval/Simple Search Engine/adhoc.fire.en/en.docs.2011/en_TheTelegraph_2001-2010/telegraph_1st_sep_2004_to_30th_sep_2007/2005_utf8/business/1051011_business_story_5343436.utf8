 Madura knits new strategy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 10: Madura Garments, part of the Aditya Birla group, is betting on exclusive and premium retailing of international brands. 

 Recently, it entered into a strategic tie-up with lifestyle brand, ESPIRIT. The deal will strengthen Maduras portfolio in womens wear, premium relaxed clothes and accessories. The partnership will also tap the retail business in India.

 The move is part of Maduras strategy to bring international premium brands to India. 

 ESPIRITs launch may pave the way for other international brands coming here, a possibility not denied by senior officials.

 Commenting on reports that Madura is planning to bring Armani to the country, president Hemchandra Javeri said the developments are only at a nascent stage. Numerous international brands have approached us for a strategic tie-up. 

 Maduras portfolio of premium brands, which includes Louis Philippe, Van Heusen, Allen Solly, Peter England and SF Jeans, have been posting a growth rate of more than 20 per cent, Javeri said. Many overseas brands have been attracted by this growth rate. 

 Madura has focussed on merchandise, communication and retail. Our merchandise, say in a product like Louis Philippe, has focussed on giving the consumer nothing but the very best, an official said. It has increased the retail distribution of Louis Philippe by setting up more exclusive stores, apart from distributing through other channels like multi-brand outlets.

 Madura Garments has been spending about 5-10 per cent of its sales on advertising and brand building. Louis Philippe, the flagship brand, last year recorded a sales of Rs 175 crore at MRP value. While it is the market leader in the super-premium category of shirts, in suits category Louis Philippe has already occupied the second slot in a span of two years, officials added.

 China mulls yuan reform 

 Exchange at ease 

 Beijing, Feb. 7 (Reuters): China?s yuan is not substantially undervalued given the country?s balance of payments, but it will manage capital flows with the aim of eventually making the currency convertible on the capital account, China?s central bank governor said.

 But Zhou Xiaochuan, who made the remarks in an interview with the official Xinhua news agency, said China would follow its own timetable for currency reform, according to the needs of its development.

 Zhou made the comments late Saturday in London where China attended the Group of Seven talks.

 China will ?set up mechanisms to control capital flows to create conditions to achieve renminbi convertibility under the capital account at an early date,? Xinhua said.

 But Zhou also said any reform would require a stable macroeconomic environment and healthy financial system and that the impact on the global economy should be considered.

 China has been under pressure from rich nations to liberalise its currency, which is currently pegged near 8.28 to the dollar. The United States and Europe have complained the exchange rate is too low, making Chinese exports artificially cheap on world markets and costing US manufacturing jobs.

 Zhou?s comments echoed those his deputy Li Ruogu made earlier on Saturday, when he said, ?We are determined to move toward a flexible exchange rate, but no timetable.?

 China went into the G7 meeting knowing it would likely come under pressure over the yuan, but analysts have said it also enjoys the prestige of being at the meeting and recognition of its importance to global trade and financial markets.

 ?China also hopes through dialogue to deepen industrialised countries? understanding of China,? Xinhua quoted Chinese finance minister Jin Renqing as saying in a separate report on Sunday.

 Jin added China hoped to create a global economic environment that would ?maintain the fast and healthy development of China?s economy.?

 He characterised China?s talks in London as ?frank and honest? and that the country hoped to continue such dialogues.

 The weekend meeting marked China?s second invitation to attend G7 talks, after it participated at the last gathering in Washington in October.

 Indian in running for top job at HP

 K.P. NAYAR

 Vyomesh Joshi

 Washington, Feb. 11: Silicon Valley, the most visible Indian constituency in America, is agog at the prospect that an Indian may be picked to head one of its jewels, the $80-billion Hewlett-Packard (HP). 

 Vyomesh Joshi, 49, who came to America three decades ago to study electrical engineering in Ohio and stayed on to join HP in 1980 as a research and development engineer, is among the frontrunners to succeed the controversial Carly Fiorina, who was ousted as chief executive this week.

 Joshi rose through the ranks of the company, becoming a project manager for inkjet components four years later, general manager for inkjets, personal imaging and printing in 1999, president of this subsidiary group in 2001 and on to his current job as executive vice-president of HP three years ago.

 According to latest mandatory published data, Joshi, in his present job, gets an annual salary of $712,500 and an annual bonus of $513,090. In addition, he is entitled to long-term compensation of $2,055,642 and stock options worth $3,509,952.

 Joshi?s succession to the top job in HP is not a done deal yet, but within the company, he does not have much competition. Bob Wayman, who was appointed acting CEO following Fiorina?s departure, has said he wants to return to his job of chief financial officer once a new CEO is approved by the company?s board.

 The only two other internal candidates now in the running, according to corporate grapevine, are Shane Robison, chief technology officer, who is also in charge of strategy, and Ann Livermore, who runs the services and enterprise hardware divisions.

 It is to the advantage of Joshi that HP?s printer unit, which he was directly in charge of, delivers 73 per cent of the company?s operating profits. 

 In three years, Joshi increased profit margins there from 10 per cent to almost 17 per cent at the end of 2004.

 Those who want to pip the Indian to the post are putting out word that Joshi has no experience in corporate computing. They are mounting pressure on HP?s new chairperson, Patricia Dunn, to look for a CEO outside the company.

 Fiorina was the first outsider to be appointed CEO in the history of the company that was started in a California garage. On Wednesday, Dunn replaced Fiorina, who was both CEO and chairperson. Fiorina had a rocky relationship with Walter Hewlett, son of HP?s founder Bill Hewlett, and she fell out with several members of the board.

 Hewlett and Fiorina disagreed on everything. They even contributed exact amounts to rival US presidential campaigns last year: Fiorina for George W. Bush and Hewlett for Democrat John Kerry. 

 If HP?s board decides to bring in an outsider once again, that would make Michael Capellas, chief executive of MCI, a frontrunner to step into Fiorina?s shoes. He was president of HP for six months after its turbulent merger with Compaq in 2002 ? an event that proved the most controversial in Fiorina?s five-and-a-half-year tenure ? and has the advantage of knowing the merged structure well.

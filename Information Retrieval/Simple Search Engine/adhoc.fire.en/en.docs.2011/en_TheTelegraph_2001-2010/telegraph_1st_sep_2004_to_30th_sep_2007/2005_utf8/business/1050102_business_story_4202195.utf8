 Fresh sanctions barred

 Washington, Jan. 1 (AP) US President George W. Bushs administration is being temporarily barred from imposing new limits on imported clothing and textile products flowing into the United States from China.

 The action by a federal court in New York comes as US textile makers brace for an even greater surge of Chinese apparel imports when decades-old worldwide quotas expire today.

 US textile and clothing manufacturers, worried about more competition coming from China, are seeking protection from the administration to limit Chinese imports.

 Industry officials decried the action, saying it could further hurt beleaguered US factory jobs.

 Importers of Chinese goods and the retailers that buy apparel and textiles made in China hailed the judges decision.

 Judge Richard Goldberg of the US Court of International Trade in New York on Thursday issued a preliminary injunction that temporarily bars the administration from considering petitions seeking restrictions on imports of clothing and textiles from China.

 The US Association of Importers of Textiles and Apparel, whose members include J. C. Penney, Liz Claiborne and other retailers, sought the injunction. The Bush administration opposed the group?s request.

 The issue of trade with China has been politically touchy for the administration. Democrats have accused Bush of not doing enough to protect American workers from unfair foreign competition.

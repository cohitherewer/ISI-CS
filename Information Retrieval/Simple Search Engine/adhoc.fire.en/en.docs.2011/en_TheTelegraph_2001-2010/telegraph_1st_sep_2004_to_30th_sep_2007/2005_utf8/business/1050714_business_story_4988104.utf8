 New Delhi, July 13: India and Pakistan today agreed to appoint financial consultants for the proposed Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline ?at the earliest?.

 The consultants will draw up a contractual framework to guarantee safe delivery of gas at an affordable price.

 Petroleum secretary S.C. Tripathi, who led the Indian side at the joint working group meeting, said the two countries have agreed to enter into a ?framework agreement? after the basic issues related to the project were satisfactorily resolved among the three nations.

 India will submit a draft of the agreement to Pakistan before the next meeting of the joint working group in Islamabad at the end of August.

 Officials said the ?financial advisory consortium? for each country could be appointed by September 15. 

 The consultants are expected to submit their reports by November-end, when petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar will visit Islamabad to hold talks with his Pakistani counterpart, Amanullah Jadoon.

 Aiyar expects the proposal to take a concrete shape by December and the pipeline to be completed by 2010. 

 However, no dates related to the project have been mentioned in the joint statement issued at the end of the two-day talks. 

 According to the statement, the two sides had an in-depth discussion on the technical, financial, commercial and legal aspects of the project. 

 Ways to price the gas reasonably and develop a feasible project structure were also explored. 

 It was agreed that these matters would be pursued in greater detail at subsequent meetings of the joint working group. 

 Pakistani oil secretary Ahmad Waqar said, ?The framework agreement will address concerns for pipeline safety and gas delivery to India.? 

 The price would depend on the well-head cost of the gas, transportation cost and the transit fee, he added.

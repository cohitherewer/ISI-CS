 States need to review act to get farm grant

 Calcutta, Feb. 5: The ministry of agriculture has warned states that they will not receive their share of the Rs 2000 crore earmarked for the development of agri-based industries if they fail to review the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act.

 In most states, the APMC Act prohibits farmers from selling their produce outside the mandi, and has become a stumbling block for private investments from hypermarts, who usually buy in bulk.

 Speaking at a seminar organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today, Radha Singh, secretary, ministry of agriculture, said, ?an open letter has been issued to all states. Karnataka, Maharashtra, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Kerala have responded to the notice. We are yet to get a feedback from the other states.?

 West Bengal does not have the mandi system.

 The APMC Act had been reviewed and renamed the State Agricultural Produce Marketing (Development and Regulation) Act 2003. The new act sought to permit private and corporate bodies to establish a marketing network for agriculture produce and change land leasing laws to facilitate renting of the operational land by private companies.

 The act also eliminates the commission agents who control farm produce marketing and encourages direct dealings with private companies and co-operative units.

 Other reforms include promotion of contract farming, formation of competitive agricultural markets in private and co-operative sectors, expansion of the credit system and development of negotiable warehouse receipt system through forward and future markets.

 Singh said the main objectives of the tech mission for horticulture was to encourage research and development, stabilisation of production, food processing and marketing.

 The ministry has also recently entered into a contract with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to identify major produces in five states in the country and fund the development of infrastructure and set the ball rolling for food processing and marketing of the processed products.

 ?A mere 1.5 per cent of the total fruit production in the country is processed. Food wastage is as high as 30 per cent,? said Singh. ?We are in discussions with the commerce ministry on steps to be taken to minimise this wastage.?

 She added that the government would encourage private-public partnership in biotechnology, seeds production and farming techniques to allow financial institutions to come forward and reduce the hold of the moneylender who charges between 20 per cent and 40 per cent interest on loans given to farmers.

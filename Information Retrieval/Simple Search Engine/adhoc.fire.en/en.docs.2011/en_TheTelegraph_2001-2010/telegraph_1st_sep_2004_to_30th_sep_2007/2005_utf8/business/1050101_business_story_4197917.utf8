 Hyundai targets 14% rise in sales

 Ready to roll

 Seoul, Dec. 31 (Reuters): South Korea?s Hyundai Motor raised on Friday its sales target for 2005 by 14 per cent to 2.58 million vehicles, targeting overseas markets as part of its ambition to become one of the worlds top five auto makers. 

 Hyundai Motor, which controls half its domestic market, is aiming to lift its sales, combined with those of affiliate Kia Motors Corp, into the global top five by 2010. 

 But it faces a slew of risks ranging from flat local sales to higher steel prices, a stronger won currency and high oil prices. ?We expect the stagnant local economy to continue into next year and domestic demand for autos is likely to remain weak as a result,? Kim Dong-jin, Hyundai Motors chief executive, said at a year-end staff meeting. 

 Exports, the companys main growth engine in 2004, were also losing steam as the dollars fall weakened the firms competitiveness, he said. Exports make up 60 percent of Hyundai Motors earnings. The won has appreciated 15 per cent this year against the dollar. 

 ?But we are confident that improving productivity, better brand image and cost-cutting efforts will help us sustain recent years of strong growth. quot; 

 Hyundai Motor sold 2.26 million vehicles worth 32 trillion won ($30.74 billion) in 2004, Kim said. It was the first time Hyundai had sold more than 2 million. 

 The firm was aiming to sell 600,000 vehicles at home in 2005, slightly up from a provisional 550,000 units this year, while targeting 1.98 million unit sales overseas, up from 1.71 million. The combined sales next year are expected to be valued at 36 trillion won. 

 Kia suffers loss

 Affiliate Kia, which has yet to unveil its sales target for the new year, would bolster its local market share to more than 27 per cent from this year?s 23.2 per cent, Kia President Yoon Kook-jin said in his year-end speech. 

 ?In domestic business alone, we posted some 300 billion won of losses this year. But we will be able to raise our market share with the help of new model launches next year,? Yoon said. 

 ?Next year we will focus on upgrading our brand image and quality even more to raise competitiveness in overseas markets. quot; 

 Local media has reported Hyundai and Kia were aiming to raise 2005 auto sales by some 9 per cent to a combined 3.6 million vehicles from an estimated 3.3 million unit sales this year. 

 Company officials could not confirm the figures. 

 Hyundai is set to open in March its first plant in the United States, which will have capacity to produce 300,000 units a year.

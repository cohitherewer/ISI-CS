 Hind Petroleum net profit drops 69%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 27: Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) has seen its net profit tumble 69.6 per cent to Rs 235.92 crore during the third quarter ended December 31 from Rs 775.71 crore in the year-ago period. The sharp fall was attributed mainly to the heavy losses in LPG and kerosene sales, which the oil company has had to bear. The prices of the two cooking fuels soared in the international market but the government asked the oil companies not to pass the price increase to consumers given the political sensitivity of these products. 

 This fact is also reflected in the higher net sales during the quarter, which scaled the Rs 16,277-crore mark compared with the corresponding figure of Rs 12,939 crore for the third quarter of the previous year. 

 The net profit for the nine-month period ended December fell to Rs 777.53 crore from Rs 1,3776.89 crore in the same period last year. This represents an over 90 per cent decline in the nine-month net profit. Higher refining margins, however, helped to keep the company afloat.

 The gross refining margin for HPCLs Mumbai refinery during the nine-month period was $5.18 per barrel compared with the $3.6 per barrel in the previous year. Similarly, the company?s Vizag refinery reported a refining margin of $5.39 per barrel compared with the corresponding figure of $3.5 per barrel in the previous fiscal.

 The crude processed during the third quarter was also higher at 3.82 million tonnes compared with 3.3 million tonnes in the same quarter last fiscal and this helped to cushion part of the decline in profit. HPCL has also implemented a voluntary retirement scheme, resulting in a payout of Rs 42.14 crore, which is being amortised over a five-year period. The proportionate charge for the third quarter worked out to Rs 5.58 crore.

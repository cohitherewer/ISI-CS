 Exide cuts battery prices 

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Charged up

 Calcutta, March 1: Exide Industries Ltd has slashed storage battery prices by 7-8 per cent across all segments of the retail market following the reduction in customs duty on lead to 5 per cent from 20 per cent.

 The cut comes at a time when lead prices have doubled in the last one year. The benchmark LME prices of lead has gone up to $1000 per tonne from $450 per tonne. 

 However, domestic players like Exide could not pass it on to the retail market, putting pressure on the margin.

 Chairman and chief executive officer S. B. Ganguly said the profitability projection could be difficult to meet this year because of the high global lead prices.

 ?We have hiked prices by 15 per cent last September but rolled it back within few months. Now we have effected a price cut,? Ganguly said.

 He said high international prices would continue for the next six months as demand was robust. ?No new mines are coming up,? he added.

 Lead constitutes more than 70 per cent of the cost of a storage battery. In India, it is largely imported since domestic supply is low. Exide sources 85 per cent of its requirement through import from countries like Australia and Korea.

 The auto sector contributes 60 per cent of the Exide sales, while the remaining comes from the industrial sector.

 The company controls 92 per cent of the OEM market (all auto majors) and 70 per cent of the branded replacement/retail market.

 The replacement market provides 65 per cent of the Exide topline, while the rest comes from OEM.

 Ganguly said the demand would continue to be robust with the replacement market becoming brand conscious.

 This market is dominated by the unorganised sector. The penetration of branded storage battery in the tractor and commercial vehicle (CV) segment is very low because of its price disadvantage.

 However, with the government regulation saying companies have to buy back 75 per cent of cells they sell for recycling, there is mounting pressure on the unorganised sector. ?The players are unable to provide a mechanism to buy back the cells. If the government gets its act together, this highly poisonous business of lead recycling, flouting all environmental norms, could be prevented,? an expert said. Ganguly hoped that as the market matured, the conversion was bound to take place.

 The company is bracing itself for the good times to come. It is expanding capacity by over 10 per cent at its existing nine plants across the country to meet the demand. It is at present operating at 98 per cent capacity utilisation.

 The customs duty reduction would also help Exide and all other storage battery manufacturers (like Amara Raja) breathe easy. The customs duty now has been brought on a par with other neighbouring countries like Thailand and Malaysia, thus preventing the possibility of cheap imports when the free trade agreements (FTA) with these countries come into play in future.

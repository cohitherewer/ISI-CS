 Tata Steel on the prowl

 Muthuraman: Looking ahead

 Calcutta, Aug. 16: Tata Steel is eyeing a fresh acquisition in Southeast Asia.

 The deal could be finalised in this financial year, managing director B. Muthuraman said at an Independence Day function in Jamshedpur on Monday.

 ?We are eyeing a second overseas acquisition in Southeast Asia this year,? Muthuraman said, adding Tata Steel would also look at further acquisitions.

 Last year, the company acquired NatSteel of Singapore in an all-cash deal. It paid Rs 1,300 crore for a 2-million-tonne capacity. NatSteel had provided Tata Steel instant accesses to seven countries, including China and Australia.

 Even though Muthuraman did not elaborate on the target, sources said the deal was in an advanced stage.

 ?It is looking good at this point of time,? sources added.

 Tata Steel?s capacity stands at 7 mt following the 1-million-tonne expansion at Jamshedpur and the acquisition of NatSteel.

 Muthuraman also spelt out the company?s medium and long-term goals.

 ?We are targeting a 15-mt capacity by 2010 and 25 mt by 2025,? he said.

 Tata Steel is setting up two greenfield plants in Chhattisgarh and Orissa. It is also looking at greenfield projects in Bangladesh and Iran to take advantage of cheap feedstock and natural gas.

 Tata Steel?s overseas acquisition drive comes at a time when Mittal Steel and Posco are drawn to India by lucrative iron ore reserves.

 Apart from Tata Steel, other domestic companies like Essar and Ispat have also acquired international steel assets.

 However, foreign investment in the steel sector has caused heartburn to the local industry. Muthuraman also mentioned this in his speech. 

 He said domestic reserves of iron ore at 18-20 billion tonnes were not adequate when the average steel use reaches 300 kg per person per year. 

 ?Therefore, any policy or any decision to export iron ore from this country by any kind of arrangement will be against the national interest,? he said.

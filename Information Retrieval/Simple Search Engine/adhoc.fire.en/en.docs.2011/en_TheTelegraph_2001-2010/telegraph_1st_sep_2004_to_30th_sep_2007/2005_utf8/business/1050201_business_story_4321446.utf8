 Tata Motors races ahead

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ready to go

 Mumbai, Jan. 31: Tata Motors has declared revenues of Rs 4364.94 crore for the quarter ended December 31, an increase of 28 per cent over Rs 3399.60 crore in the third quarter last year.

 Profit after tax, after provision of Rs 140.11 crore towards current and deferred tax, was Rs 316.21 crore compared with Rs 210.88 crore in the year-ago period, an increase of 50 per cent.

 Executive director (finance amp; corporate affairs) P. P. Kadle, however, said the ?pressure on margins continues due to steel and tyres and impact of emission compliance measures?.

 The shares of Tata Motors rose in line with the performance by Rs 12.60 to Rs 504.75 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

 ?There?s an all-round improvement and in passenger vehicles, the story is almost the same,? Kadle added.

 Kadle said the balancesheet size of Tata Motors is Rs 7559 crore with a gross debt of Rs 2516 crore. The company has surplus cash of Rs 2980 crore, making it a negative net debt company.

 Even as the company expects the demand to be sustained in the current quarter ending March 31, it foresees sluggish demand conditions in financial year 2006. 

 This is because many customers are advancing their purchases by buying vehicles at lower prices before the new emission norms come into force from April. The new norms will entail automobile companies to incorporate devices in vehicles like catalytic converters, which will raise the prices.

 ?There?s only so much we can pass on to customers,? Kadle said. ?Cost increase is so massive that it is creating a strong impact on our margins.?

 Kadle said the company has set up cross-functional teams to find out ways to cut costs.

 The total sales volume for the quarter at 98662 units grew by 26 per cent over 78380 units sold in the year-ago period. Sales of commercial vehicles in the domestic market increased 26 per cent to 50908 units in the quarter, while passenger vehicle sales at 39048 units recorded a growth of 29 per cent over the corresponding period of the previous fiscal. Exports grew by 14 per cent to 8706 units.

 WBIDC forges rebirth in Sheffield of the East

 Calcutta, Jan. 19: Sheffield of Manchester is dead, but its Bengal cousin will be reborn. Long live Sheffield of the East! 

 After pollution forced Sheffield to stifle its famed foundries, thousands of miles to the east, in Howrah, the cradle of a similar industry is being pieced back together.

 At the head of the efforts to revive the once-humming workshops across the Hooghly from Calcutta is West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC).

 It has forged an alliance with foundry associations of the district for a park at Ranihati, where the first phase of a Rs 250-crore project will be over by October 2006.

 The park will be home to 150 new foundries in an initiative that will soak up close to Rs 1,500 crore. Of these, close to 100 per cent will be export-oriented units (EOUs).

 The revival run could put back on the rails foundries that have been shuttered since the mid-seventies, when the railways stopped buying cast-iron slippers holding the tracks in a shift to concrete alternative. 

 They were also hobbled by old technology, which pushed up production costs to levels beyond reach.

 The tide began to turn in 2000, when Bengal?s expanding iron and steel industry fed demand for foundry products. In recent years, that has been topped with a reputation for being a reliable exporter of industrial castings.

 The Howrah renewal comes at a time when India?s production of foundry-grade pig-iron ? the primary raw material ? is set to double to one million tonnes by the end of this year. Nearly 75 per cent of this is expected in the eastern region. The country?s 6,000 foundries manufacture two million tonnes of castings every year.

 The metallurgical coke-oven plant the Tatas have planned in the state will give foundries enough coke, a key input, by 2006. 

 It has boosted the promoters of the Ranihati park, which will come up on 1,000 acres. The Indian Foundry Association has acquired 183 acres so far.

 ?The central government will provide a Rs 50-crore aid for the park. The land acquisition is under way. In the first phase, we require 266 acre (800 bighas) of land,? the chairman of Indian Foundry Association, S.C. Dugar, said.

 In the first phase, 77 new foundries will go on stream. Of these, 32 will be export units. In three years, all foundries in and around Calcutta will shift to the park.

 At present, Bengal has 350 foundry units, which can together manufacture 6 lakh tonnes of castings annually. They will chip in with Rs 150 crore for the park. 

 Foundry association officials say the park will generate 1 lakh jobs directly and nearly 4 lakh indirectly. These will be in ancillaries and allied industries.

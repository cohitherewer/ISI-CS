 Five bidders in race for Refco

 JENNY ANDERSON

 New York, Nov. 5: The future for Refco, the fallen futures and commodities brokerage firm, looked a little brighter as five bidders submitted offers before a Friday deadline. 

 Potential buyers had worked up until the last minute to do as much due diligence as possible on the company, trying to determine the quality of the accounts, the amount of money remaining and how much of the sales force was still intact before making a bid. 

 The Interactive Brokers Group and a group led by J. Christopher Flowers, a former Goldman Sachs partner, each submitted bids for the regulated company, while the Alaron Trading Corp. submitted a bid for a part of the business. 

 Some other firms interested in Refco, including Apollo Management, a hedge fund, and a group that included Merrill Lynch, Warburg Pincus and the Susquehanna Group ultimately declined to bid. 

 Greenhill amp; Co., which is conducting the auction, will spend the weekend determining which bids are qualified. The firm will pick one as the opening bid by Tuesday, and an auction of the qualified bidders will take place the next day. 

 Refcos creditors, meanwhile, said in a bankruptcy court filing Friday that they were investigating payments made to some former company executives. The creditors requested documents about the 2004 acquisition of Refco by the buyout firm Thomas H. Lee Partners and about Refcos initial public offering one year later. As a result of those transactions, insiders received more than $2 billion from the company, according to public filings. 

 All of the insider payments, which stripped the debtors of much of the cash raised in the IPO and before, are currently under investigation by the committee and may be subject to challenge or avoidance on fraudulent transfer or other grounds, the creditors filing said. 

 Refco has been in a tailspin since the company disclosed on October 10 that its chief executive, Phillip R. Bennett, owed Refco $430 million through a company he controls. 

 Bennett was placed on indefinite leave and was later arrested and charged with securities fraud. On October 17, Refco filed for bankruptcy protection. The firms futures brokerage arm, whose capital is closely regulated, cannot be put into bankruptcy but as an asset of the company can be sold through the bankruptcy court. 

 Bidders have scrambled to examine the books of the complex company. In court last week, a judge indicated that customer accounts in the regulated unit had dwindled to $3.4 billion, from $7.5 billion before the company unravelled. 

 Bidders like Interactive Brokers, which operates a similar business, want to complement their current operations. Financial bidders like Flowers want to buy the company at a bargain-basement price, put in management to fix it up and sell it for a higher price at a later date. 

 Many of the bidders expressed concern about the status of the company. 

 quot;Its unclear what is actually there, quot; said one member of a bidding group who insisted on not being identified because of confidentiality agreements. 

 Thomas Petterfy, the chairman of Interactive Brokers, said in an interview last week that he expected some customer assets to leave, but expected them to come back when the situation was stabilised.

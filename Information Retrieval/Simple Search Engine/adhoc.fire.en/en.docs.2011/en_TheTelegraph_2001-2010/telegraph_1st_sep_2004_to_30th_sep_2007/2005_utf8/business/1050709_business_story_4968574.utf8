 Calcutta, July 8: Punjab National Bank (PNB) is keen on selling its stake in UTI Asset Management Company (UTI AMC) to the State Bank of India (SBI), which has emerged as the strongest contender.

 Earlier this year, the government had decided to put the AMC on the block, but restricted the bids to the four original sponsors ? the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), Bank of Baroda (BoB), SBI and PNB. Each of these institutions holds 25 per cent in the Rs 10-crore equity of UTI AMC.

 ?PNB is interested in selling its stake to SBI. However, we have not yet received any offer from the government,? chairman and managing director S.C. Gupta said on the sidelines of the Banking Conclave organised by Ficci here.

 SBI is poised to gain control of the AMC, with the government set to approve the deal, which could be worth Rs 1,000 crore to 1,500 crore. The proposed transaction will spawn the biggest fund house in the country.

 UTI AMC is the market leader in the domestic mutual fund business with assets under management (AUM) of Rs 21,000 crore. SBI?s mutual fund arm, SBI MF, handles around Rs 7,200 crore.

 Bait for staff

 PNB is following in the footsteps of SBI in banking operations. The PNB management is planning to introduce financial incentives for employees who achieve targets. ?We are discussing the matter among ourselves. This is part of the managerial autonomy that the Reserve Bank has given us,? he said. The bank has appointed Boston Consulting Group to reorganise the banking operations and increase profitability. 

 ?We have created two new posts of chief general managers to bring in operational efficiency in the organisation. We want to take it further down the line,? Gupta added.

 The capital adequacy ratio of PNB was a little over 14 per cent on March 31. ?We do not have immediate plans to raise funds as the existing capital can take care of our expanding business in the next two to three years,? he said.

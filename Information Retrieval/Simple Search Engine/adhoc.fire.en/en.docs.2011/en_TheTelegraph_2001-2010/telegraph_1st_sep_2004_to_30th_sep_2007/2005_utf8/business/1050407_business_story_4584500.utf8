 New Delhi, April 6: Korean automobile major Hyundai Motor India today launched its second sports utility vehicle (SUV) ? Tucson ? which will carry a price tag of Rs 14.4 lakh (ex-showroom, Calcutta).

 Hyundai?s much-awaited SUV will be available for Rs 14.3 lakh in Delhi, Bangalore and Mumbai.

 The Terracan ? which marked Hyundai?s foray into the SUV segment in late 2003 ? had failed to capture the imagination of motoring buffs and registered tepid sales. It is, however, hoping that the Tucson, which is powered by a 1991-cc turbo-charged diesel engine that packs a maximum power of 117 PS at 400 RPM, will emerge a clear winner in its category.

 The company will not offer the SUV as a petrol variant.

 Asked whether the launch of the Tucson meant the phased withdrawal of the Terracan from the Indian markets, HMIL president B. V. R. Subbu said, ?Certainly not. There is enough space for both products to co-exist in the same market.?

 The Tucson?s competitors will be the Ford Endeavour, Honda CR-V, and GM?s Tavera.

 Hyundai, the third largest passenger carmaker in the country, plans to increase its capacity from 2,50,000 to 4,00,000 units by 2007, said S. S. Yang, managing director of HMIL. By making India one of its manufacturing hubs for countries in Europe, West Asia and Latin America, Hyundai hopes to post a 95 per cent growth in exports.

 After achieving its initial target of selling 125 to 150 units of the Tucson, the company will follow the semi-knocked-down (SKD) and finally the completely-knocked-down (CKD) approach to market the SUV in India. At present, it is entirely imported from the parent company. The Tucson was first showcased at the Chicago Auto Show in February 2004.

 Hyundai hopes to complete 2004-05 with a turnover of over Rs 7,500 crore. ?With a major problem in our production facilities last year and a fire in our plants in February, it was a difficult year,? said Subbu.

 Hyundai is targeting production of 260,000 units in 2005-06 (including production for domestic consumption and exports). ?We want to stabilise ourselves in the domestic market. Post 2007, there will be a spurt in exports as we will move to a stage of consolidation,? added Subbu.

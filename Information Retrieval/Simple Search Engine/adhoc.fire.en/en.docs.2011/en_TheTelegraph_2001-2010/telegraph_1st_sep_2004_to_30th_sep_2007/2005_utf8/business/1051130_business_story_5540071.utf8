 Pathfinder in talks for tie-ups

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 29: Karachi-based Pathfinder Group has initiated preliminary talks with two Indian companies to explore possible tie-ups in the field of construction and oil and natural gas.

 We have just begun our talks with Hindustan Construction Company and the Sun Group. There are some in- principle agreements but some formal structure has to be worked out, Pathfinder managing director Ikram ul-Majeed Sehgal said.

 It could either be a strategic alliance or a joint venture, we have not decided. Things are very fluid at the moment, he added.

 It seems that the formation of a joint venture will be a difficult task since it would need certain government clearances.

 The Pathfinder group is into food, construction and securities businesses.

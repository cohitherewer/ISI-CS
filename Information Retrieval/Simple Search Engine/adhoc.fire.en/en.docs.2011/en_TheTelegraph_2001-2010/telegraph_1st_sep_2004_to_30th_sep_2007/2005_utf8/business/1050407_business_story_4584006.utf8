 India Inc to step up investment tempo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 6: A survey conducted by ICICI Bank revealed that with the economic growth expected to be at least over 6 per cent this year, India Inc is bullish on the country?s prospects of development and is also planning large investments.

 The Bank Business Outlook Survey was conducted over 100 large companies from various industrial sectors, including construction, machinery, metals, chemicals and services among others. 

 The survey, which will now be carried out on a quarterly basis, found that the corporate sector is of the view that interest rates will remain stable or rise in the near term (one year). 

 However, a significant number of respondents expected interest rates to ease from current levels in three years.

 Close to 70 per cent of the respondents feel that the economic growth will be over 6 per cent, while around 10 per cent expect it to be higher than 7 per cent.

 ?One salient feature apparent from the survey is that large companies are more bullish on the country?s growth story,? the bank said.

 While companies are confident of a robust growth, the survey indicated that India Inc wants to exploit this by investing. 

 ?The economy is witnessing a strong capex cycle and India Inc has large investment plans. One can also infer from the survey that high growth in expected sales will generally be fuelled by investment growth of more than 20 per cent,? the report added.

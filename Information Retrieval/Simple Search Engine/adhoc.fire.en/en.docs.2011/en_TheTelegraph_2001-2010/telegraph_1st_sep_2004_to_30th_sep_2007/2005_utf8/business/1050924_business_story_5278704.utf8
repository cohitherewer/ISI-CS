 Top guns take aim at market panic

 Damodaran: On the job

 Mumbai, Sept. 23: Stocks closed the week on a flat note after a see-saw session during which the sensex bounced back to a high of 8327.35 on support from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) before ending at 8222.59.

 The balm for bruised markets came from New York, where finance minister P Chidambaram, who likes to call himself the investment minister, talked investors out of bearish climes. But, after this years steepest plunge, his reassurance was not enough to push jumpy traders into new deals. Overseas investors have been rock steady in their trading stance, having shopped for shares worth Rs 514.40 crore on Thursday ? when sellers laid a virtual siege.

 Sebi chairman, also in the US with the finance minister to court overseas moneybags, had already done his bit to calm raid-spooked markets on Thursday by indicating that short sales could be allowed. This cheered up market players who have long pressed for the option, allegedly abused by bears in previous market meltdowns.

 Short sales are necessary, said Deena Mehta, a prominent broker on BSE, which had to stop BLESS, an arrangement that allowed borrowing and lending of shares. Its democratic. Let investors be free to sell or buy. Otherwise, it seems as if you can only buy, she added.

 D.C. Anjaria, a capital market expert who was part of Sebi committees, is not surprised. Every time there is a crisis situation developing, such statements are made, he says. However, he agreed that a proper lending and borrowing system must be in place before short sales are allowed. Anjaria sees financial institutions, depositories and mutual funds as potential stock lenders. 

 The recent Sebi decision to clamp circuit filters at 5 per cent is also being seen as a restrictive move that traps investors in a stock. Mehta, instead, suggests a mechanism that halts trading for an hour to let panic die down. 

 New issues

 The primary markets heaved a sigh of relief after Suzlon Energys IPO was oversold 13 times on the first day. The issue was said to be one of the more expensive ones. Another costly issue was HT Media, whose shares are now quoting below their IPO price.

 Mumbai, Nov. 8: US treasury secretary John Snow wants India to further open up its financial and banking sectors to foreign investors. The US official, who is on a four-day visit to the country, also wants a commercial arbitration process to be put in place to shorten the time taken to resolve potential disputes.

 While commending India on the progress that it had achieved after initiating reforms, Snow said the rapid growth needed to be backed by adequate infrastructure like power plants, roads and ports, which need huge investments.

 During the day, Snow met Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Y. V. Reddy and later visited the stock exchanges.

 Pointing out that the country needs to develop its infrastructure, Snow said, infrastructure needs finance and opening up of insurance, health and banking sectors would help fund such long-term projects.

 The US treasury secretary said raising the foreign investment limit in the insurance sector will not be a bad idea and that allowing foreign investments in retail sector too was not a bad idea as a lot of growth was expected in this sector.

 While the country had gained a lot over the past 15 years due to reforms, Snow said India would have to put a commercial arbitration process in place to bring down uncertainties over settling legal disputes.

 During the meeting with the RBI governor, Snow is understood to have discussed the roadmap prepared by the central bank on increased foreign participation in the banking sector. Snow said, There are larger potential in your markets...There is scope for non-Indian banking institutions to operate in the Indian market.

 The US official expected that oil prices would come down over time. On actions taken by central banks to contain inflation, he said the responsibility of central bank governors is to lean against inflation and that they have a done a pretty good job in that.

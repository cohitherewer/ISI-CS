 Damage control in markets

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 20: Shares of leading pivotals bounced back from a three-day losing streak on the bourses today as the sensex went on a 109-point rally fuelled by ONGC and Reliance Industries. 

 Foreign investors seem to be a part of the rebound termed a ?relief rally? by cynics. Brokers allude to the cues from leading Asian markets as a major factor behind the rally today. Investors largely ignored surging global oil prices that crossed $52 per barrel.

 The BSE sensex opened on a firm note at 6169.83 against Tuesdays close of 6134.86 and vaulted to an intra-day high of 6259.28 on aggressive buying. Later, it closed at 6243.74, showing a sharp 1.77 per cent rise over Tuesday?s close.

 Reliance Industries (RIL) gained 3.13 per cent at Rs 530.20 on reports that the US international trade commission had rejected a dumping claim on polyethylene exports from India, Indonesia and Thailand. The RIL scrip has a weightage of nearly 11 per cent in the sensex.

 Dealers attributed the rebound to shortcovering in the futures and options segment. 

 However, some analysts expect the markets to remain in correction mode till RIL, Tata Steel, Tata Motors and Wipro and Satyam announce their annual results. 

 Sectors that saw investor interest were metal, auto and select banking shares. The sensex has lost more than 10 per cent over the past six weeks after registering its all-time peak of 6954.86 points on March 9. 

 The gainers included Infosys, Hero Honda, Tata Steel, Maruti, Wipro, Reliance, Bajaj Auto and HDFC Bank, ONGC and Satyam Computers.

 The volumes also saw a spike with a turnover of Rs 2057.29 crore against Rs 1930.13 crore on Tuesday. TCS continued to be the most active stock with a turnover of Rs 309.69 crore followed by Tata Steel at Rs 145.50.

 The A group saw 121 scrips, including 26 from the sensex, recording modest gains, while 74 finished with losses.

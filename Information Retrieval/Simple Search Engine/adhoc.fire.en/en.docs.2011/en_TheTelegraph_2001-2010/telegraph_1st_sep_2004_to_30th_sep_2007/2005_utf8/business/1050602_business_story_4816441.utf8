The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 IISCO merger likely to be cleared today

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 1: The long-awaited merger of Burnpur-based Indian Iron amp; Steel Company (IISCO) with parent Steel Authority of India (SAIL) may come through soon. The cabinet is likely to clear the proposal tomorrow. 

 In a meeting convened by the Prime Minister last month it was decided that the merger proposal would be taken up among priority infrastructure projects in the next cabinet meet. 

 Earlier, the Planning Commission had frowned at the cabinet note seeking the merger and instead advised that IISCO should be offered similarly to other players and SAIL could still acquire IISCO if it bids a high-enough price. But the steel ministry has turned it down, sources said. 

 The cabinet note on the IISCO merger is based on the governments belief that with steel prices ruling at all- time highs and the SAIL subsidiary getting back in the black after decades, this is right time to merge the firm with its parent company and revive it. 

 Steel prices have increased by more than 250 per cent over the last couple of years and IISCO, which turned in a Rs 27-crore profit last fiscal after three decades, is expected to nearly double its profits in 2005-06. 

 There is, however, another reason for the hurry in pushing through the note now after years of inaction. 

 The BJP-ruled Jharkhand government is trying to grab three extremely valuable mining leases in Chiria mines, which form the core supply chain for IISCO, and re-allot them to private steel firms which have long been eyeing these lucrative concessions. 

 The Centre is, however, determined this should go to SAIL to stem its expansion plans.

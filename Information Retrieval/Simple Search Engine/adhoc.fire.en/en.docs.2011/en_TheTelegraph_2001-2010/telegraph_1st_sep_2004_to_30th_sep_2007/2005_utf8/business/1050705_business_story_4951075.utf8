 Google shines on Wall Street

 San Francisco, July 4 (Reuters): Google Incs share price has more than tripled since its August debut, but some analysts say the stock risks a tumble if the Web search leader does not trounce analysts earnings expectations, as it has in each quarter since its IPO. 

 Unless the numbers are very favourable, there is the potential for the stock to get hit, said Standard amp; Poors Internet equity analyst Scott Kessler. Expectations are getting to a point where theyre excessive, said Kessler, who has a hold rating on Google shares and a price target of $317. 

 Shares closed at $291.25 on Friday, off their high of $309.25. 

 Stockholders expect Internet titans like Google to grow at break-neck speed and soundly beat Wall Street profit targets at the same time. When companies fall short of ever-higher expectations, they are punished. 

 Shares of online auctioneer eBay Inc, dropped 19 per cent the day after its fourth-quarter profit rose 44 per cent ? a result that matched its targets but missed analysts average estimate for the first time in eBay history. 

 Yahoo Inc, Googles closest rival, last July posted a second-quarter profit that doubled year-on-year, but its shares shed nearly 8 per cent of their value after the results only matched Wall Streets average estimate. 

 Google investors have grown accustomed to eye-popping overperformance from the Silicon Valley Web darling and have pushed Googles market value to more than $80 billion compared with eBays $45 billion and Yahoos $48 billion.

 Petronet to hike capacity at Dahej

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Aug. 30: Petronet LNG Ltd (PLL), the largest liquefied natural gas importer in the country, has decided to go for a higher capacity expansion at Dahej in Gujarat.

 The decision, which involves higher investment as well, has been taken keeping in mind the northern and eastern markets.

 Talking to The Telegraph, Prosad Dasgupta, director (finance) of PLL, said the companys capacity would be 12.5 million tonnes as against 10 mt earlier envisaged. PLLs present capacity stands at 5 mt.

 PLLs investment will be go up by Rs 400 crore from Rs 1,300 crore to Rs 1,700 crore, Dasgupta said.

 We are not talking about it right now as we are yet to tie up LNG for the additional 2.5 mt. The company has been on the look out for long-term contract, Dasgupta added.

 Ras Gas of Qatar has committed to supply 7.5 mt of LNG. PLL is also supposed to get LNG from Iran.

 The expansion will be completed by the last quarter of 2008.

 The additional capacity would help in meeting the gas-starved eastern market.

 Dasgupta, who is tipped to become the next chief executive officer and managing director of the company, said the EPC contract for the expansion project would be awarded by end of November. Four consortiums are in the race for the same. 

 Meanwhile, PLL has decided to invest Rs 2,400 crore in Kochi to set up a 2.5 mt terminal that can be expanded to 5 mt. It will be completed in 42 months following the award of EPC contract, which is expected to be wrapped up by end 2006.

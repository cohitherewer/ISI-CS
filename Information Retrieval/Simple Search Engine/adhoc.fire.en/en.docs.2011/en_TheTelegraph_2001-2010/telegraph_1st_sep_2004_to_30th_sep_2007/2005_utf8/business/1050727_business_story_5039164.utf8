The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 New flank in Birla battle

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 26: After repeatedly frowning at the basic integrity of Rajendra Singh Lodha since the inheritance controversy tumbled out of Birla Park last year, the Birlas today raised doubts over the city-based chartered accountants professional ethics. 

 In connection with the prayer for appointment of an administrator to control and protect the assets of the MP Birla group, Birla familys counsel S.B. Mukherjee alleged that Lodha had given different statements before different authorities about his firms.

 While arguing in the court of Justice Kalyanjyoti Sengupta, Mukherjee said according to the list of firms published by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, Lodha and Company has 14 partners in Calcutta, eight in Mumbai and five in Delhi. 

 But the partnership deed of Lodha and Company showed that the firm had only three partners, Lodha and his two sons Aditya Vardhan and Harsh Vardhan, submitted Mukherjee.

 From questioning the manner in which shares of East India Investments were transferred to Lodha to highlighting the chartered accountants involvement in other business without seeking the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Indias permission, Mukherjee raised a host of other issues. 

 Casting doubts over Lodhas personal and professional conduct, Mukherjee argued that Lodha should not be allowed to have total control over the assets of the MP Birla group. These charges are baseless and false. We will deal with them during our argument, said a spokesperson of Fox amp; Mandal, the solicitor firm representing Lodha. 

 Mukherjee also submitted in the court that the schedule of assets of the estate of Late Priyamvada Birla, provided by Lodha, was not full and so the court-appointed special officers were finding it difficult to prepare the inventory. Justice Sengupta passed an order directing the special officers to submit an interim report on the progress of inventory preparation and the difficulties, if any, faced by them within a fortnight.

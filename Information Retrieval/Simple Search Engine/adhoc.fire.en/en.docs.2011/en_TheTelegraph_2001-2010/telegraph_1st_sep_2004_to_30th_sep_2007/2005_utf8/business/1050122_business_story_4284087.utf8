 Ficci recipe for robust growth 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 21: India Inc feels that the country needs robust growth in the manufacturing sector if it has to attain an 8 per cent GDP growth.

 Giving a broad perspective on the manufacturing sector, a study carried out by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) says, ?A sharp increase in the manufacturing sector workforce will take the pressure off the agriculture sector and increase income levels.?

 Estimates made by the chamber suggest that it is essential for both manufacturing and services to grow at more than 11 per cent even as agriculture growth picks up close to 4 per cent.

 A comparison with other major Asian countries shows that the size of the value added in the Indian manufacturing sector is less than one-fifth of the Chinese, and even less than half of the Korean manufacturing sector in the year 2000.

 While the figure stood at $373 billion for China, it was $144 billion for Korea and a meagre $66 billion for India during 2000.

 The manufacturing sector in India grew at an average annual rate of 6 per cent for 14 years, for the period between 1990-91 and 2003-04. This was higher than the 5.8 per cent growth in the industry and 5.7 per cent GDP growth during this period.

 However, the growth in this sector has fallen sharply in the last seven years compared with the first seven years of the reforms period. It has slumped from 7.4 per cent to 4.7 per cent.

 The study says there are additional costs imposed on the manufacturing sector on account of multiplicity and high level of taxes and high cost of capital. Moreover, poor quality and excessive user charges of support infrastructure services add up to 12.2 per cent of the cost of production.

 The average total incidence of indirect taxes on the selling price of all commodity groups is approximately 36.25 per cent, says the survey.

 ?While customs duties have been brought down over the years, the government has been increasing the excise duty burden on the manufacturing sector,? says Ficci.

 In addition, higher cost of utilities, inefficiencies at Indian ports, railway freight prices and high cost of finance to manufacturing industry are some of the other deterrent factors.

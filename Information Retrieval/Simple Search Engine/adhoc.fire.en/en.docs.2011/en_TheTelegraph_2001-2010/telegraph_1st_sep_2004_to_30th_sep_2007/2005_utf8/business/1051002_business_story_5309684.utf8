 Nalco plans Gulf joint venture

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, Oct. 1: National Aluminium Company is planning to set up a joint venture project in West Asia.

 The state-run company has short-listed Dubai, Oman and Qatar for the project for which the feasibility report would be ready in a couple of months, Nalco chairman-cum-managing director C.R. Pradhan said on the sidelines of the company?s 24th annual general meeting yesterday.

 ?We are talking to several parties for setting up an alumina smelter plant there,? the CMD said.

 When asked why Nalco was going to the Gulf countries while big aluminium producers, like Dubal, from there were setting up shops in Orissa, Pradhan said the availability of cheap power in West Asia was the main reason. Since an aluminium industry consumes more power, it makes sense to start a smelter plant there, Pradhan said.

 Meanwhile, Nalco is embarking on the second phase of its expansion in a month. It will increase its bauxite production capacity to 63 lakh tonnes from 48 lakh tonnes at present, alumina refinery capacity from 15.75 lakh tonnes to 21 lakh tonnes, smelter production from 3.45 lakh tonnes to 4.60 lakh tonnes. 

 The Orissa government has recommended leasing the Pottangi bauxite deposit mines to the company. The 80-million-tonne deposit, in addition to the Panchpatmali reserves, is expected to secure Nalco?s future growth plans.

 After completion of the Rs 4091.51-crore expansion in 2009, Nalco will have surplus alumina of 1.2 million tonnes and the company will become the sixth biggest aluminium producer in the world. 

 The excess alumina could be utilised to set up a 6-lakh-tonne smelter unit, said Pradhan. ?The possibilities of locating one in a West Asian country are being explored because cheap power is available there,? he added.

 The public sector undertaking today declared a final dividend of 40 per cent (including an interim dividend of 20 per cent paid in February this year) for 2004-05, accounting for a total payout of Rs 257.72 crore.

 The Nalco chairman announced a net profit of Rs 1234.84 crore for 2004-05, a 67 per cent rise from the previous year?s earnings of Rs 737.37 crore. Nalco achieved a turnover of Rs 4374.60 crore during the year, surpassing its previous best of Rs 3324.84 crore in 2003-04.

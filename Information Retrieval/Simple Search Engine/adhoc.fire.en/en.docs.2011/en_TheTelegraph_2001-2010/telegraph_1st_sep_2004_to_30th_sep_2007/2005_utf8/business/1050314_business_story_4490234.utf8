 NPCIL revs up power generation

 Mumbai, March 13 (PTI): In three years, Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) would be able to generate an additional 3,960 MW of electricity from its seven power plants, which are under advanced stages of construction.

 ?This would make the total electricity generated by the year 2010 to 6,780 MW from the current 2,770 MW,? said chairman and managing director S. K. Jain.

 The country?s first 540-MW nuclear power plant at Tarapur (Taps unit 4) became critical on March 6 and is expected to join the western grid in August. The last unit that was commissioned was the Rajasthan Atomic Power Station unit 4 in 2000.

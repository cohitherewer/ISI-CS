 Jindal Poly Films issue on June 9

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 31: Jindal Poly Films Ltd, part of the Rs 1500-crore B C Jindal group manufacturing flexible packaging films, is coming out with a follow-on public issue aggregating up to Rs 300 crore to fund its expansion plans. The issue opens on June 9 and closes on June 15.

 The company, which manufactures BOPET films (polyester films) and BOPP films (polypropylene films), is undertaking an expansion exercise in these two production lines, which includes installation of additional coating and metallising lines for producing high value added products. 

 The first phase of the expansion is expected to be completed by December and the second phase will be taken up in 2006.

 The company, formerly known as Jindal Polyester Ltd, acquired the French company Rexor S.A.S in November 2003 to gain access to various advanced metallised and coated films production technologies, which can be used in its production facilities in India. Recently, DEG, one of Europes largest development finance institutions, invested in Jindal Poly Films and it now holds close to 9.5 per cent of its equity capital.

 The company is focussing on being an integrated packaging films manufacturer. Its plant at Nashik is the largest single-location unit in India for the manufacture of flexible packaging films.

 Jindal Poly Films diversified into BOPET film production in 1996 after being a producer of only yarn since 1985. In 2003, it commenced production of BOPP films and metallised films. It now plans to commence production of coated films, too.

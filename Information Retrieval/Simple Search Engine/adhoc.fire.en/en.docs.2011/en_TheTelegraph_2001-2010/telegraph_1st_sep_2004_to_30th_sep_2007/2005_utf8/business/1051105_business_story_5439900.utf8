 Wolfensohn: New role

 New York, Nov. 4: The worlds biggest bank is hiring the former chief of the World Bank.

 Citigroup said on Thursday that James D. Wolfensohn, 71, who left as president of the World Bank last spring after 10 years at the helm, would serve as a global strategy adviser to senior management and clients. 

 He will also become chairman of Citigroups International Advisory Board in 2006. 

 Wolfensohns appointment comes just a day after Shengman Zhang, 48, a World Bank managing director from China, was named the vice-chairman of Citigroups global banking division and chief of its public sector group.

 Citigroup already has a toehold in more than 100 countries outside the US, and its overseas operations contributed about 40 per cent of its operating income in the first three quarters this year. But the fast-growing economies in Latin America, Eastern Europe and Asia have become an increasingly important focus as places to expand its retail presence and take advantage of higher business investment returns. And both Wolfensohn and Zheng bring a wealth of worldwide political connections.

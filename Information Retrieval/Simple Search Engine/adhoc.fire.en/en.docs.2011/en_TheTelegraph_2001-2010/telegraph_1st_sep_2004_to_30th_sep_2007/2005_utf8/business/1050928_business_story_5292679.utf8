 Lupin ropes in Ranbaxy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Sept. 27: Lupin is on an African safari. Within a day of signing a tie-up with Aspen of South Africa, Lupin today entered into a deal with Ranbaxy Laboratories. 

 Under the deal, Ranbaxy will market Lupin?s tuberculosis drug, Akruit, in West and North Africa.

 The deal with Ranbaxy is an in-licensing agreement. 

 ?This arrangement will leverage Ranbaxy?s field-force and marketing strengths in West and North Africa to promote Lupin?s TB brands,? said Lupin MD K.K. Sharma.

 The alliance will leverage the combined strengths of Ranbaxy?s global marketing and distribution network and Lupin?s international expertise in the management of TB.

 ?We believe that this unique arrangement combines the strengths of both companies in controlling TB in areas of Africa most severely impacted by this dreaded disease,? said Malvinder Mohan Singh, executive director, Ranbaxy. 

 Ranbaxy will market the brand in Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Algeria, Chad, Mauritania and Congo.

 Akurit is a fixed-dose combination, which complies with the WHO norms of dosage requirements, safety, patient compliance and convenience. 

 TB has been declared as an emergency in Africa after 46 ministers of health unanimously adopted a resolution at the WHO Africa Regional Committee in Maputo, Mozambique, on August 25. There are around 1,500 TB deaths everyday in Africa and about half-a-million every year, largely young men and women.

 Calcutta, May 3: Watch lovers take heart. The legendary Swiss watchmaker, Omega, is opening an exclusive boutique in the city on the lines of its international flagship showrooms. 

 The boutique will showcase the entire range of Omega watches in an ambience comparable with the company?s flagship stores in Zurich and Paris and it will store all gold watches along side diamond fitted watches and watches of white gold and platinum. The shop will be the first such exclusive store by any international watch manufacturer in the city.

 Jonathan P. Stalder, area sales manager of Omega, said the company has been looking for a suitable location for its brand store in the city.

 At present, Omega has two boutiques in India and those are in Mumbai. The company now intends to open three more this year ? Calcutta to start with. Next, Bangalore and Chennai will have one Omega boutique each. In the next five years, the company is planning to open 10-12 such exclusive stores in India.

 ?We believe there are discerning consumers in the city. Our sales here are growing at a steady rate of 20 per cent. We hope the new store will unfold the entire Omega experience for the people of Calcutta,? Stalder added.

 There are four sub-brands under the Omega umbrella. All of them ? Constellation, Seamaster, Speedmaster and De Ville ? will be available at the boutique.

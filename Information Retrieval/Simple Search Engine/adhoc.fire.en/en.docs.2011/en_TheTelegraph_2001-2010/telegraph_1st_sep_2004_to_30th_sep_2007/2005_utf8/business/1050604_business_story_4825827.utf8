 Rate of inflation drops to 5.38%

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 3: The rate of inflation declined for the fourth consecutive week ended May 21 to 5.38 per cent mainly due to cheaper primary articles, including food and fuel products. The widely tracked point-to-point wholesale price index (WPI) inflation declined by 0.17 per cent from the previous weeks level of 5.55 per cent. It was 5.20 per cent in the year-ago period.

 WPI rose 0.1 per cent to 192.1 points even as heavy weighted manufactured products prices remained unchanged. The index was at 182 points in the year-ago period.

 The government revised upwards its inflation estimate to 5.45 per cent during the week ended March 19 compared with the provisional estimate of 5.11 per cent.

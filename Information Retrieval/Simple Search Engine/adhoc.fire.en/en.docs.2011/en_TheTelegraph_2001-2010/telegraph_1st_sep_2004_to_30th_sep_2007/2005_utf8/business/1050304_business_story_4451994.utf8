 IOB to seek board nod for global offer

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Overseas call

 Mumbai, March 3: Indian Overseas Bank (IOB) is considering an issue of global depository receipts (GDRs) which will be listed on the Singapore stock exchange.

 In a letter sent to bourses today, the bank said its board will meet on March 10 to consider raising equity through GDRs. The plan will have to be cleared by regulators.

 IOB?s overseas hunt for capital comes at a time when other banks have been rushing to the domestic capital market to raise equity through a spate of public offerings. The funds will largely be used for expansion of their business and to meet stiffer Basel-II capital norms. 

 In many ways, therefore, IOB is first off the block among nationalised banks in recent times with an overseas listing. 

 However, officials in Chennai, where the PSU bank is based, refused to divulge details of the issue.

 The government owns over 61 per cent of IOB. Institutional investors control 15.36 per cent of the equity and the public 19.77 per cent. The rest is with private corporate bodies, non-resident Indians and overseas corporate bodies.

 At a time when profits of many banks have taken a beating from the shrinking treasury income, IOB reported a net profit of Rs 161.21 crore in the third quarter of the year ended December 31 against Rs 142.01 crore in the corresponding period of last year. The growth was achieved largely due to sustained rise in credit.

 Operating profit in the nine months to December was Rs.997.46 crore compared with Rs 959.30 crore in the same period last year. Net profit was Rs 494.14 crore against Rs 435.41 crore in the corresponding period last year.

 In the same period, net interest income increased to Rs 1377 crore, a jump of around 18 per cent over last year?s levels; the bank?s capital adequacy was 13.90 per cent.

 IOB, with a network of 1500 branches in the country, first hit the bourses in 2000-01, raising over Rs 111 crore in an issue where there were buyers for 1.87 times the shares on sale.

 On the BSE today, the IOB stock finished at Rs 70.95 after opening at Rs 70.10 and rising to an intra-day high of Rs 71.50. In all, over 4 lakh shares changed hands in 1802 deals.

 Montek stirs IISCO pot

 At the crossroads 

 New Delhi, April 17: The steel ministry has been appalled by Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia?s suggestion that Indian Iron and Steel Company (IISCO), a SAIL subsidiary, be put on the block and that the steel behemoth should bid for assets along with others.

 Ahluwalia?s proposal has injected an element of controversy into the SAIL-IISCO merger plan just before it was due to come up for cabinet?s approval.

 A senior steel ministry official said: ?The plan panel?s advice is difficult to accept. IISCO is, strictly speaking, not owned by the government, but by SAIL. So we can?t put it up for sale. SAIL can do so but its board no longer wants to sell it.?

 ?Second, it would be extremely anomalous if SAIL were to put up IISCO for sale in the market and bid for the shares it already owns,? they added.

 SAIL had earlier tried to sell IISCO but could never find suitable buyers for the plant. However, officials admit that in asituation of rising iron ore prices, most global firms would only be too keen to snap it up. 

 ?But the sale does not help the government. Earnings from such a deal would go to SAIL. In any case, this PSU just does not want to sell off its subsidiary any more. So we can?t really force this,? officials said.

 The plan panel had questioned the cabinet note seeking the merger, advising instead that IISCO should be ?offered similarly to other players?. 

 ?SAIL could still acquire IISCO if it bids a high price,? it added.

 The plan panel had written to the steel ministry against the proposal it has put up before the cabinet. 

 It has also suggested that the matter be referred to the Board for Restructuring of Public Sector Enterprises. But steel ministry officials feel this too cannot be done because it is not so much a restructuring exercise for a sick PSU. It is rather a case of an ?extremely profitable? PSU like SAIL merging a subsidiary with itself.

 The ministries normally give their comments in favour or against a cabinet proposal but rarely does any minister take a diametrically opposite stand on an issue which the government is keen to expedite. 

 In fact, the note has come as a political bombshell for the Congress-led government as both the steel minister Ram Vilas Paswan and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh have made varying degrees of commitment to Left leaders on their demand that IISCO be merged with SAIL.

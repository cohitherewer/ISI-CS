 State Bank to review targets

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 27: The State Bank of India (SBI) is all set to review business targets for the current fiscal, chairman A.K. Purwar said.

 This comes after finance minister P. Chidambaram criticised some frontline public sector banks, which have projected a lower deposit growth in 2005-06 than in the previous fiscal. He also lamented that in some cases, a deceleration was projected in the growth of advances as well.

 While it is not known whether SBI features in the finance ministers list, Purwar said the bank will review business targets in a board meeting to be convened soon. He, however, did not divulge the details.

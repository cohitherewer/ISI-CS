 New Delhi, Sept. 27: A slowdown in farm sector investments has led Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to seek a convergence of resources of the Rs 1,74,000- crore Bharat Nirman programme with the resources of the agriculture and water resources ministry to strengthen the asset base for agriculture. 

 Singh was addressing the full Planning Commission meeting on agriculture today. 

 The progress in completing ongoing irrigation projects has been very disappointing ... It is important that we explore the scope for converging the resources under Bharat Nirman and the National Employment Guarantee Scheme with the resources of the ministry of agriculture and water resources.

 At a separate follow-up meeting with about 50 CEOs from the food processing sector, the Prime Minister also promised to take up demands for excise and customs duty sops, but said a decision on allowing FDI in processed food retailing would depend on political consensus.

 At the plan panel meet, Singh listed crop diversification and market reforms as two other key areas of action on the farm policy front. 

 Indian agriculture must move from traditional grain-based strategy towards diversification... As a first step towards market reforms, it is necessary for states to amend the Agriculture Marketing Committee Act, he said.

 The amendments to the act are needed to allow for contract and free marketing, organised retailing, smooth flow of raw materials to agro-processing industries, competitive trading and adoption of innovative marketing systems and technologies, he said. 

 I am informed that a few states have already taken steps in this direction. The process needs to be accelerated and completed urgently, Singh said. 

 The Prime Minister said development of dryland and rainfed areas, which constitute 60 per cent of the net sown area, posed a major challenge. The agriculture ministry has sought a thrust on this sector. 

 At a meeting with chiefs of food sector companies, including ITC, Cargill India, Dabur, Pepsi Foods, Parle Bisleri and Rasna, Singh said he recognised the importance of facilitating large investments in the sector, which had great employment potential. 

 The government is targeting about Rs 100,000 crore in investment from this sector over the next decade. 

 Singh also assured the CEOs that he would pass a law unifying all food laws into one and impress upon state governments to amend their agricultural marketing acts to help farmers sell their produce directly to food processing companies instead of through mandis.

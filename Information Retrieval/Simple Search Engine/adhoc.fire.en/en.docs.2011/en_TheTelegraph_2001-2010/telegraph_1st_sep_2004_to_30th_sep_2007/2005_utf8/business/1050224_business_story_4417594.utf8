 Concrete plan for steel push

 Calcutta, Feb. 23: The Brussels-based International Iron and Steel Institute (IISI) and 11 member companies will launch a five-year programme to help increase the consumption of steel in the construction industry.

 The euro 14 million programme ? Growing Market for Steel In Construction Consortium Agreement (GMSIC) ? will be launched in July-August this year. 

 The institute hopes to raise consumption of steel in the construction industry worldwide by 10 per cent.

 The 11 companies have two Indian names, Tata Steel and Ispat Industries. The others are Arcelor, BlueScope Steel, CELSA, Corus, Mittal Steel, Posco, Erdemir, IMIDRO and Ruukki. The initiative is an opt-in programme for companies operating in the construction sector. 

 The programme seeks to provide participants with a competitive edge through market research, technology benchmarking, knowledge management and an international architectural competition and demonstration building. IISI hopes to induct more members into the alliance in 2005. 

 The intellectual property developed by GMSIC would be retained by IISI but it would be available to all members. It is expected to increase generic demand for steel in the construction industry such as infrastructure, residential and non-residential.

 India, which accounts for only 3.5 per cent of global steel production, will also be benefited. In fact, India with only 30 kgs per capita consumption as compared with the global average of 121 kgs and China?s average of 128 kgs, has more upside as a country. 

 India?s steel production stood at 32 million tonnes last year, of which the construction industry alone consumes 20 million tonnes. The Indian Steel Alliance (ISA) has targeted a domestic steel production of about 100 MMT by 2020. 

 ?With the government?s focus firmly on infrastructure sector, the consumption of steel in construction will surely go up,? an analyst said.

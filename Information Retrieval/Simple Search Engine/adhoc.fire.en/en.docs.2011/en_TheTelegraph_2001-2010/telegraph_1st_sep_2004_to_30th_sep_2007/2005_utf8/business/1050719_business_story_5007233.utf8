 Sebi told to let off UBS with penalty

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 18: The Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT) today sent indications that Sebi should consider plea bargaining and a penalty of Rs 50 crore on UBS Securities Asia Ltd, a foreign institutional investor that has been forbidden from issuing participatory notes for a year. 

 The forum that considers appeals against orders issued by Sebi said the move would stem endless litigation.

 Under plea bargaining, a defendant agrees to accept guilt for the smaller charges made against it, while the prosecutor drops the serious accusations. All offences committed by the firm are compounded in the process, which is popular in the US and other developed markets. 

 SAT presiding officer Kumar Rajaratnam, while hearing UBS Asias appeal against Sebi, said the market regulator could consider a process similar to plea bargaining as an innovative step to put an end to endless litigation. The suggestion comes at a time when the Centre appears to have softened its stand on the mayhem of May 17, 2004, when the sensex crashed 568 points. 

 In recent weeks, finance minister P. Chidambaram has also conceded that he had not found any major manipulation on May 17, 2004. Barring one or two entities, he said the rest acted out of genuine apprehension. 

 The crash was sparked by concerns over how the UPA government, which had just been swept to power last year, would reconcile to the demands of the Left parties, which were believed to be opposed to reform measures.

 In its investigation, the regulator picked UBS after finding proof that it failed to discharge its obligations on regulatory counts. It was also charged with withholding critical information in a way that hampered probe. 

 On May 17 this year, Sebi barred UBS Securities Asia Ltd and its associates from issuing participatory notes (offshore derivative instruments) with underlying Indian securities for a year. The punishment, part of its drive to track down those responsible for the meltdown last year, was the first in a series of decrees to follow. The firm had vowed to contest the bar. In all, 12 brokerages are under the scanner.

 UBS allowed its clients to invest in India through participatory notes ? instruments that enable foreign investors not registered with Sebi to buy shares here. Brokerages, UBS in this case, send back dividends and capital gains to these investors, most of whom funnel their money through tax havens such as Mauritius.

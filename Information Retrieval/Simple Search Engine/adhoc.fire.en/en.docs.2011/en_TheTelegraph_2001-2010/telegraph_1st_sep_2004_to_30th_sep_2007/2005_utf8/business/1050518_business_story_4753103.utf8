 Posco flexible on ore swap

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, May 17: The final round of negotiations for the $12-billion steel plant of Posco today began in New Delhi with the Korean major hinting that it may not swap iron ore from the captive mines that may be allotted to it.

 Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik has discussed with Union finance minister P. Chidamabram the infrastructure facilities required for the steel plant.

 Posco India representative Ryu Ho Chang said the swapping proposal was based on the contention that Indian ore has high alumina content, which was not conducive for making high-grade steel. 

 Once we are given prospecting licence and if the ore quality is on a par with international standards, we would drop the idea of swapping, he said.

 Chang added that Posco may not even swap ore as the augmentation cost would be $35 per tonne, including freight charge. We are trying to avoid it as it would jack up the cost of steel production, he said.

 Last week, Posco director Tae Hyun Jeong had said it would swap the iron ore from its captive mines in Orissa with that of Brazil. 

 Sources said Patnaik has set May-end as the deadline for signing the Posco deal. 

 Posco officials also told The Telegraph that the deal is not far away. Its going okay. Both the parties are active. But it all depends on the state government, said Chang. 

 Posco officials said the company would develop the infrastructure near the Paradip port in collaboration with the state government on a public-private partnership model.

 While the Centre is keen on pushing through the Posco deal, the state government has been cautious and bargaining hard with the South Korean steel major as Opposition leaders and even ruling BJD MPs are alleging that Posco is being given preferential treatment. 

 If Posco argues that Indias ore has high alumina content, then how come reputed companies like SAIL, RINL and Tata have been producing international grade steel using the same ore? asked former Union steel minister Dilip Ray. Ray alleged that the state government has shifted the scene to Delhi feeling the heat of the Opposition.

 Meanwhile, there is an undercurrent of opposition from other potential steelmakers, who are irked over the fact that their proposals are hanging fire as everybody is busy only with Posco.

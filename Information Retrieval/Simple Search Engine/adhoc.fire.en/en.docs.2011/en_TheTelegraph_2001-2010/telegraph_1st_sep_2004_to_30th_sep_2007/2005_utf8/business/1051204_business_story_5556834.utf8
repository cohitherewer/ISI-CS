 Shackles off oil hunt on Orissa coast

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Ready for the drill 

 New Delhi, Dec. 3: The ministry of environment and forests has lifted restrictions on the oil hunt off the Orissa coast following assurances by ONGC, Reliance and Gazprom of Russia that their drilling operations would not harm the endangered Olive Ridley turtles or interfere with their movement in any way. 

 Director general of hydrocarbons V. K. Sibal told The Telegraph that the clearances from the environment ministry for all the companies has come through and they would be following the ?global best practices? to ensure that the Ridley turtles or their natural habitat was not adversely affected.

 Sibal said a study had been commissioned to study the behaviour of the Ridley turtles and the routes that they followed for coming to the Orissa coast and later returning to the southern hemisphere. 

 The directorate general of hydrocarbons has earmarked Rs 3 crore for the study and satellite imaging will also be used to get an accurate picture of the behaviour of the turtles. 

 While the money has been allocated from the kitty of the Oil Industry Development Board, to start with the oil companies engaged in exploration off the Orissa coast have agreed to reimburse the amount on a pro-rata basis. 

 The oil companies have undertaken to implement any new risk mitigating measures that the study may recommend to protect the turtles.

 Earlier these companies were not allowed to undertake any drilling operations from May to September on the grounds that this could a pose to the sea turtles visiting the Orissa coast for nesting and breeding at this time. The environment ministry had taken the view that the oil exploration activities could disturb the natural breeding environment of the turtles on the Orissa coast. 

 However, this restriction had adversely affected the countrys hunt for oil and gas as four crucial months were lost. There was also the problem of having to stop drilling operations mid-way as the prohibited time span overlapped with the exploration schedule for the year. 

 The time restrictions were also making it difficult for these companies to meet the work deadlines set out in the contracts in terms of the number of wells that have to be drilled.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar had asked the directorate general of hydrocarbons to fund all studies required to protect the Olive Ridley turtle and other endangered marine species from any harm that could possibly occur from an adverse environmental fallout of the country?s offshore oil hunt.

 Environmentalists fear that the Olive Ridley turtle which comes to the Orissa coast for breeding could be adversely affected by the oil exploration being undertaken in the Krishna-Godavari and Mahanadi offshore basins. Various metals and chemicals used in the course of drilling, the possible spillage of oil and the disturbance to the environment are considered potentially dangerous to the turtle.

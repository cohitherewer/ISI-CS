 Shell-Total Hazira terminal takes off

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, April 21: The Shell group and Total of France today announced the commissioning of their LNG joint venture terminal at Hazira in Gujarat with the arrival of the first cargo from Australia.

 The two companies have invested over Rs 3,000 crore in the Hazira LNG terminal project and plan to expand the operations of the deep-water, all weather port ?in partnership with other parties with specialised port experience?.

 The Hazira project includes an LNG receiving and storage terminal within a newly built protected harbour. The first batch of customers for the gas are reported to be in Gujarat.

 The gas would be mainly used by power plants and fertiliser units.

 The initial throughput capacity of the terminal is 2.5 million tonnes a year. However, this can be increased to 5 million tonnes with marginal incremental investments once the demand for LNG grows in the region. 

 ?In line with market expansion, the terminal is expected to subsequently achieve a throughput capacity of 10 million tonnes per annum,? the company said in a statement.

 Marc den Hartog, director of Shell India, said: ?Hazira is a global first for the LNG industry. The traditional model for gas import calls for long-term contracts of 20 years or more, with rigid terms. In contrast, Hazira aims to offer flexibility in contract duration and will match fluctuations in customer demand profile.?

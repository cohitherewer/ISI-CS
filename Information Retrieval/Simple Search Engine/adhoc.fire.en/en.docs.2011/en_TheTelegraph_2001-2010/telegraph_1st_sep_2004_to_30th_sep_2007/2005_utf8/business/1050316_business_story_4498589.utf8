 Glaxo buyback at Rs 800 apiece

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 15: GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals Ltd (GSK Pharma) today announced a buyback price of up to Rs 800 per share. This falls within the limit of Rs 230.65 crore or 25 per cent of the total paid-up equity capital of the company.

 This decision was taken at a board meeting today. Regarding the rationale for the share buyback, managing director S. Kalyanasundaram said operating performance of the company has significantly improved since 2001.

 ?An improved performance, together with income from the sale of properties, has resulted in substantial cash generation and a favourable liquidity position. A buyback of shares will enhance earnings and improve shareholder value,? he added. 

 GSK Pharma will now seek shareholders consent for the proposed buyback by postal ballot. GSK plc, the promoter, currently holds 49.15 per cent of the pharma major. The remaining is divided between institutional investors (28.19 per cent), public (19.64 per cent) and private corporate bodies and NRIs/OCBs.

 However, the GSK Pharma scrip came under pressure on the bourses after announcement of the buyback as market participants were disappointed over the price. Many had expected the company to announce a buyback price of up to 825 per share.

 In February, Kalyanasundaram had hinted at a buyback offer while announcing the company?s annual results for the year ended December 31, 2004. He had said the parent would like to have at least a majority stake in the domestic entity and there were no plans to delist it.

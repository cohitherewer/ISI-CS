 Bitter pill for DRL in Eli Lilly patent suit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 15: Dr Reddy?s Laboratories (DRL) has lost a key patents case against drug major Eli Lilly amp; Company.

 A US district court upheld the patent validity of Zyprexa, Lilly?s blockbuster drug to treat schizophrenia. DRL, along with Ivax Corp and Teva Pharmaceuticals, failed to convince Judge Richard Young that they had strong evidence of the patent?s validity.

 The decision arose from a May 2001 suit by Eli Lilly against these companies. Had DRL been successful, it would have resulted in the company making a generic version of the drug. DRL had earlier won a patent lawsuit involving Lilly. This case, concerning anti-depressant Prozac, brought the company a windfall of $60 million.

 DRL has now decided to appeal against today?s decision in a higher court. ?We are disappointed by the order and will appeal against it to the Federal Circuit. Despite the adverse ruling, our strategy remains unchanged and we continue to make consistent progress towards building a sustainable generics business in the US,? DRL chief executive G. V. Prasad said.

 The ruling turned out to be a bitter pill for the Hyderabad-based company on bourses, where its share plummeted to an intra-day low of Rs 700 after opening at Rs 720. It ended at Rs 711.80, a loss of Rs 25.15 over its last close.

 The order is widely considered a decisive victory for Lilly, as Zyprexa accounted for around 30 per cent of previous year?s revenues, which stood at more than $4.40 billion.

 Alternatively, it is a big disappointment for DRL, which has faced a series of reverses too. ?A favourable ruling could have been a major booster,? an analyst pointed out.

 In recent weeks, DRL had been in the spotlight after it signed a $56-million deal under which ICICI Venture will pay for the expenses that the company incurs on developing and commercialising abbreviated new drug applications.

 ICICI Venture will fund the development, registration and legal costs related to commercialisation of new drugs on a pre-determined basis. The largest private equity and venture fund management company will extend $22.5 million in the first phase with an option to invest $33.5 million in the second.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Down to nowhere for stocks

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 28: Markets struggled to stave off the selling spree rocking them over the past week and failed today to halt another hurtle, by 112 points, in the sensex.

 The 30-share bellwether index was tottering at 7685.64, below the crucial threshold of 7700 points, as foreign institutional investors (FIIs) pulled out cash from shares, and a clutch of firms failed to fulfil result hopes.

 The barometer has slipped around 250 points this week, and a nerve-jangling 1136.20 points since its October 5 high of 8821.84. Operators have banished the thought it will hit 9000 ? having seen the magic milestone blip on their trading screens just weeks back ? by Diwali.

 Analysts believe a flight of buyers from the trading floor has been responsible for the bourses inexorable slide into an uncharted free-fall zone.

 Portfolio inflows turned into outflows, which were pegged at Rs 755 crore on Thursday. This was the largest single-day pullout in six years. FIIs have dumped shares of Rs 2684 crore this month.

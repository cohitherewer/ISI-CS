 Hazira awaits first LNG shipment

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 14: Shell expects the first consignment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to arrive at its Hazira terminal next month.

 Shell Gas and Power director Marc den Hartog said the company had not tied up any consumers as yet. However, he was confident that once the gas arrived they would line up. 

 He said most of the potential consumers that had approached Shell were looking for two to three-year contracts. As a result, Shell had not tied up for any long-term arrangement.

 Parcels of the gas would be picked up from the open market depending on the demand. He said Hazira would be ?a merchant terminal? and the price of the gas would be determined by the prevailing market conditions.

 Shell retail outlet

 Shell has set up a petrol and diesel retail outlet in Bangalore and is planning to set up a few more this year. The company has a licence to set up 2,000 petrol pumps.

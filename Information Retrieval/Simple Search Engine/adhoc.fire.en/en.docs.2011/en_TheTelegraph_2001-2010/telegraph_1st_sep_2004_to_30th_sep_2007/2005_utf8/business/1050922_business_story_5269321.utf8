 BPO boom to continue

 NETWORKED

 New Delhi, Sept. 21 (PTI): India has maintained its top position among global sourcing destinations and the market opportunity is likely to touch $50 billion by 2007, said research and analyst firm Gartner.

 Although more options for external service provision are becoming available worldwide, India remains the market leader with a majority of essential resources and a sufficiently robust technology infrastructure, the firm said.

 It has predicted that by 2007 total global offshore spending on IT services will reach $50 billion.

 Strong government support is rapidly propelling Chinas capabilities into the frame, while Latin America, Brazil and Mexico are increasingly becoming attractive options. In eastern Europe, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Russia are among the countries to watch, Gartner said. 

 It has, however, recommended that despite Indias current prominence, organisations seeking an offshore service provider should consider multiple country options.

 According to Gartner, India is currently the clear leader.

 It has the majority of essential resources and sufficiently robust infrastructure to deliver IT products and services successfully. Other countries, including China, Brazil and the Czech Republic, are making inroads, but they currently lack some of the attributes to qualify as leaders, it said.

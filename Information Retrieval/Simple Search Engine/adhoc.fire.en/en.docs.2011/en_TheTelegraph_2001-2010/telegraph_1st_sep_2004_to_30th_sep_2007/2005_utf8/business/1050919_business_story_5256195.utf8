 New Delhi, Sept. 18: Meet the new Dragon slayer.

 A low-profile Madhyamgram-based television company ? Proftel Ltd ? wants to take on Chinese electronic giants in a price and brand war.

 Proftel chief executive Amitabha Mookherjee, a 50-year-old former IIT Kharagpur student, is no longer happy making about 1.2 lakh televisions for Philips and Onida. 

 ?I make global standard televisions, which I sell at cut rates to big marketers. That?s exactly what the Chinese used to do. I intend following them and try beating them on the price and quality fronts here.?

 ?I want to build my brand Proline into a national name. If the Chinese can come and sell brands that nobody has heard of before, I don?t see why we should be afraid of spending similar amounts on brand-building to do exactly the same,? said Mookherjee. He had developed the first colour TV in the country as head of production for Telerama in 1980.

 Proftel has a modest target of selling just 2-2.5 per cent of the estimated 10-million local colour TV market, under its Proline brand. 

 Besides CTVs, the Proline brand will also cover air-conditioners, DVDs, home-theatre systems and even cheap computers. Mookherjee admits that brand-building will be a costly business, but says he has accounted for it. He plans to spend Rs 100 crore over the next five to seven years. 

 ?I know my territory, I know I can match, if not beat, the Chinese on the quality front and beat them on the pricing with low shipment costs ? I think it makes sense for me to get into the lower price segment of the market,? he said.

 Proftel, with a Rs 100-crore turnover, makes about 1.5 lakh television sets a year. Mookherjee wants to more than double the figure by setting up new plants in Goa and Himachal. ?I have decided on setting up a greenfield factory at Nahan in Himchal Pradesh and am buying a Goa sick unit that used to manufacture TVs for BPL,? he said.

 ?We also assemble other electronic products like home-theatres and DVDs. We will expand our units at Madhyamgram and Himachal Pradesh units,? he said. 

 ?I don?t want to compete with Philips or Samsung. I am trying to muscle into the lower-price segment, which was earlier dominated by Indian players but is now in the grip of the Chinese,? he added. 

 Mookherjee?s target is to take the turnover to Rs 250 crore in two to three years.

 Proftel started in Noida with tape recorders, two-in-ones, radios and music systems for brands like Bush, Murphy, Onida and Hitachi in 1990. Seven years later, Proftel shifted base to Bengal to set up a state-of-the-art TV plant to turn out colour sets for existing clients.

 ?I wanted to get back to my roots,? said Mookherjee, who had first tasted running a firm when he became the chief executive of Hotline at the age of 36 in the 1980s. 

 However, the real reason for trying to hit the centrestage is not just the urge to beat the dragon. ?I make and sell products at very low rates which are then sold at a better profit by a bigger name ? I think its time to graduate up the value chain,? Mookherjee said.

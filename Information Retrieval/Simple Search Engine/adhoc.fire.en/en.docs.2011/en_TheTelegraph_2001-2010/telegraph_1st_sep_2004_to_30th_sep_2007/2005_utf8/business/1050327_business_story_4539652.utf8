 Wal-Mart director quits

 Washington, March 26 (Reuters): Wal-Mart Stores Inc?s former vice-chairman Thomas Coughlin resigned as director on Friday over a company probe into unauthorised use of corporate gift cards and personal reimbursements that has also been reported to federal prosecutors.

 Coughlin, who still sat on three board committees, including one for strategic planning and finance, resigned at Wal-Marts request in a disagreement over the matter, the company said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

 The worlds largest retailer also said it had fired three employees, including one officer, over the probe involving an amount estimated at between $100,000 and $500,000.

 A spokeswoman at Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart declined to name the dismissed employees.

 Efforts on Friday to reach Coughlin, who joined Wal-Mart in 1978 and was named vice chairman in 2003, were unsuccessful.

 Wal-Mart said it had reported the matter to the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas based on the findings of the investigation, including Coughlins response to questions about his knowledge of certain transactions.

 quot;The investigation relates to personal reimbursements, payment of third-party invoices and the use of company gift cards, quot; Wal-Mart said in a statement. quot;There will be no adverse financial impact to the company in connection with this matter. quot;

 In the SEC filing, Wal-Mart said the items at issue quot;appear to have been obtained from the company through the reporting of false information on third-party invoices and company expense reports. quot;

 Coughlins resignation follows the firing in December of three executives and four managers from its headquarters for violating company rules. A company spokeswoman at the time declined to specify which rules were violated and said no more terminations were expected in relation to that particular matter.

 Wal-Mart said in December that Coughlin would retire the following month as vice chairman after 25 years with the company, but would remain on the board until its annual shareholders meeting on June 3. Wal-Mart shares closed at $50.66 in New York Stock Exchange on Thursday after hitting a 52-week low of $50.53.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Wanna be a Crorepati?

 Forget KBC2. You can still make that pot of gold if you invest wisely. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay tells you how

 Tapas Mitra, 28, is a pro when it comes to cracking software codes, but a hopeless wreck when it comes to planning his investments. He has a plum assignment as a software programmer in a multinational company and takes home Rs 30,000 at the end of the month. 

 He has salted away his cash in bank deposits, employees provident fund and life insurance policies. And he still dreams of the day when he will retire with a bank balance of at least Rs 1 crore.

 Mitra lives in horror of the stock markets: he doesnt have the stomach for a gut-wrenching roller-coaster ride on the bourses. So, is Mitra living in some dream world? Is there a zero-risk road to riches? 

 Surprisingly, the answer to that is yes. 

 The good old Public Provident Fund (PPF) can make you a millionaire, provided you join it early and follow a systematic investment pattern. 

 Consider this: a 25-year old person contributing Rs 5,000 a month to his PPF account will accumulate Rs 1,07,87,032 when he attains the age of 60 ? the age of superannuation. Intrigued? Put it all down to the magic of compounding interest (see table). But the most important factor that can make this happen is a regular investment pattern, precisely the monthly investment schedule.

 Why invest Rs 5,000 per month, when one can invest Rs 60,000 one time in a year? That is because every monthly investment in a PPF account earns a simple interest at the rate of 8 per cent for the rest of the year. 

 So, a monthly investment of Rs 5,000 amounts to Rs 62,600 at the end of the year, which is Rs 2,600 more than a one-time investment of Rs 60,000. The difference may seem minuscule when you compare it over the time period of one year. But over a period of 35 years, the kitty could swell to Rs 4.5 lakh! Can you still ignore it? 

 Let us see how it actually works. When you start with an investment of Rs 5,000 in a PPF account in the very first month of a financial year (because the lock-in period in a PPF account is considered from one financial year to the 15th financial year), the investment earns a simple interest of Rs 400 for the remaining months of the year. 

 Similarly, the next instalment will earn an interest of Rs 366.67 for that year. 

 All these monthly interests add up to Rs 2,600, which means that at the end of one year, your total accumulation in the account stands at Rs 62,600 rather than Rs 60,000.

 Now this Rs 62,600 earns a cumulative interest at the rate of 8 per cent for the second year, while the second years instalments earn the monthly interest. Thus, your PPF accumulation at the end of the second year is Rs 1,30,208 (and not Rs 1,24,800).

 At the end of 35 years, when you have attained the age of retirement, guess what you have amassed? More than a crore of rupees. 

 The income tax deductions for all the PPF contributions during the interim years have not been taken into consideration, these are extra.

 But the great limitation of this investment planning is that you?ll have to start early because more than Rs 70,000 cannot be invested on a yearly basis in a PPF account, though one can renew investment in a PPF account for a period of five years at a time beyond the stipulated maturity period of 15 years.

 So how can a person who is, say 30 years, chart a plan for retirement? 

 If PPF cant do it, EPF can. In employees provident fund, interests are paid on monthly balances after the end of the first year and an employee can increase his voluntary contribution to EPF up to 20 per cent of his basic salary. 

 The stipulated employees contribution is 12 per cent of the basic salary, which is subject to a maximum of Rs 6,500.

 Thus, for late starters a combination of PPF and EPF will work for building the Rs 1-crore kitty for retirement.

 But note that the older you are, the higher the monthly investments you will have to make in order to achieve the magic mark (see table). So what are you waiting for?

 - G-20 meet vows to reduce global imbalances amp; protectionism

 Xianghe, China, Oct 15 (Reuters): The G-20 group of rich and developing nations has vowed to adopt any policies necessary to address high oil prices and other risks facing the global economy, according to a draft of a statement to be issued from a weekend meeting.

 ?We are concerned that long-lasting high and volatile oil prices could slow down growth and cause instability in the global economy,? said the draft statement, obtained by Reuters on Saturday.

 Imbalances in the global economy and rising protectionism exacerbated uncertainties and aggravated vulnerabilities, the draft said.

 ?We are resolved to implement the necessary fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies (and) accelerate structural adjustments to resolve these imbalances and risks,? it said, noting that action would take account of shared responsibilities.

 Ministers and central bankers from the world?s rich countries and developing ones such as China and India are meeting near Beijing this weekend.

 ?Imbalances? refers to such problems as the enormous current account deficit of the United States and the corresponding surpluses of other countries, particularly those in Asia.

 While Americans? willingness to borrow and spend, and other countries? willingness to lend, is helping to fuel world growth, economists say the situation is unsustainable.

 World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz, also attending the talks, called on rich countries to make painful concessions in world trade talks.

 Wolfowitz said the talks would fail unless all countries gave ground to reach an outline deal at a meeting in Hong Kong in December of the 148 member nations of the World Trade Organisation.

 ?It?s not an exaggeration to say that 1.2 billion people living in extreme poverty need a result from Hong Kong,? Wolfowitz told reporters.

 Oil, which Japanese finance minister Sadakazu Tanigaki said was the focus of Saturdays morning session, attracted special attention in the draft statement.

 ?To stabilise the oil price at a reasonable level we agree to work together and call on the international community to strengthen co-operation to improve production and refining capacities, and to enhance dialogues between oil suppliers and consumers through the existing fora,? the draft document said.

 The G-20 stressed the need to promote energy saving and alternative sources of energy and to reduce subsidies on oil products, it said.

 Crude oil prices soared to $70 a barrel at the end of August and have been generally trading between $60 and $70 since then.

 French finance minister Thierry Breton told the meeting that the global economy had, so far, weathered the recent surge in oil prices relatively well. ?We should remain cautious about the future, as the resilience of our economies is not unlimited,? he told the opening session.

 ?The recent inflation upswing in many countries is a warning flag we should take into account,? he said. 

 One answer to the US current account deficit frequently suggested in the US would be stronger Asian currencies, particularly China?s yuan.

 Shot in the arm for Bharti Telesoft 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 5: Three leading global venture capital funds ? WestBridge Capital Partners, Sequoia Capital and Cisco Systems ? together today scooped up a 10 per cent stake in Bharti Telesoft for about $13.5 million. The strategic investment would provide Bharti Telesoft with a shot in the arm to develop products for value-added telecom services.

 While Goldman Sachs-backed Westbridge has pumped $8 million in Bharti Telesoft, Sequoia Capital put in $3.25 million and Cisco System invested $2.25 million, said Bharti Enterprises vice-chairman Rakesh Mittal.

 He added that the Bharti group and its management, which hold 75 per cent and 25 per cent equity respectively in the company, would dilute their stakes proportionately.

 WestBridge Capital Partners managing director S.K. Jain, who is all set to join the Bharti Telesoft Board, said, We believe that value-added services are poised for rapid growth globally.

 Services such as billing systems are expected to be a multifunctional and highly computing exercise in the near future. As such, the service providers will have to explore methods to offer easy billing for innovative services which will differentiate them in the market.

 Bharti Telesoft provides a complete range of telecom products, including solutions for roaming, pre-paid, messaging, call management, content and customer care billing.

 Both Bharti Telesoft and Cisco Systems will provide service providers with solutions for evolving their business models, said Sameet Mehta, business development manager, Cisco Systems.

 Bharti Telesoft will use the investment to fund acquisitions, enhance product development and expand globally, Bharti Telesoft CEO Sanjiv Mittal said.

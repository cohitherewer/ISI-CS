 Calcutta, Sept. 20: TPV Technology, the $5-billion Taiwanese firm, has launched the AOC brand of monitors in India.

 The growing demand for personal computers and monitors has prompted the company to promote its own brand. Till now, it was present in India as an original design manufacturer (ODM).

 We shipped over 1.1 million monitors through the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) route last year. This year the number is expected to go up to 1.5 million, said Mukesh Gupta, vice-director of TPV Technology India.

 The total monitor market in India is around 3.8 million units. About 52 per cent of this market is controlled by vendors of branded monitors. The remaining consists of local vendors and sellers of assembled units.

 Till now, we were associated only with the branded segment as an ODM. With the launch of AOC, we will tap channel markets and expand our presence in the country, said Gupta. We expect to sell 6000 units during October to December.

 The company is already talking to Isyn, AamarPC and Chirag brands in the eastern region. The eastern region comprises 25 per cent of the total monitor market in India.

 Regarding manufacturing, Gupta said earlier monitors were manufactured at the companys Bangalore plant. But with import duty on monitors reduced to zero, it is commercially not viable to continue manufacturing in India. The company procures monitors from its five manufacturing units in China.

 Last year, TPV had a 20 per cent share of the total global monitor market. This year we expect to ship 35 million monitors, which is 30 per cent of the world-wide demand of around 110 million units, Gupta said. Of this, 22 million will be TFT panels and the rest CRT monitors (conventional).

 TPV merged its business with Philipss monitor division in December last. In the deal, the Taiwanese company took over five global factories from Philips in return of a 13 per cent equity stake in TPV.

 In India, the TFT panel business has grown from a mere 5 per cent last year to 15 per cent this year. 

 The price difference is a major hurdle towards the adoption of TFT panels. While a 15-inch CRT monitor costs Rs 4000, TFT panels cost Rs 10,000, Gupta said.

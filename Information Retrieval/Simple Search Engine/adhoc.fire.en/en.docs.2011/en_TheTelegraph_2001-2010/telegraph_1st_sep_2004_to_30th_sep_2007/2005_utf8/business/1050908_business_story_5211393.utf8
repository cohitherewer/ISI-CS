 Auto giants alliance for new technology

 Joining Forces

 Frankfurt, Sept. 7 (Reuters): German luxury carmaker BMW will join DaimlerChrysler and General Motors in an alliance to develop new hybrid vehicle technology, two auto industry sources told Reuters on Wednesday.

 A BMW spokesman declined to confirm or deny the carmakers plans pending a formal announcement.

 DaimlerChrysler and GM last month finalised a deal to co-develop new hybrid vehicle technology as they try to catch up with Japanese rivals on the fuel-saving systems that reduce harmful emissions.

 The automakers say they will develop a two-mode hybrid technology that boosts both acceleration and fuel economy by 25 per cent and can be used on a wide variety of vehicles.

 Joining the project marks a shift of emphasis for BMW. The worlds largest maker of premium cars has until now focused on developing next-generation power-trains that either burn hydrogen in converted internal-combustion engines or use hydrogen in fuel cells.

 The alliance is pitted against Japanese rivals such as Toyota Motor Corporation and Honda Motor Company Ltd, which have a headstart in the hybrid market.

 BMW sold 99,193 vehicles in August, a 23.2 per cent increase over the previous year.

 The Munich-based firm also said on Wednesday that the sales of its flagship BMW brand gained 23.9 per cent to 85,079 units, while its Mini brand posted a 19 per cent rise to 14,055 cars. Its sales for the first eight months in this year totalled 856,731 units, a rise of 11.4 per cent, which is better than the forecast for the year. 

 Briefing reporters in Sydney last month, BMW chief executive Helmut Panke had said the year-to-date group sales rising between 9 and 9.5 per cent, buoyed by an even stronger August delivery. But Panke has often undershot actual retail figures.

 Thanks to key new models like the compact 1-Series hatchback and the revamped 3-Series, the company has vaulted past archrival Mercedes-Benz as the worlds most popular luxury brand. The company said the 1-Series, which first hit the market last September, sold 136,246 units. Its 3-Series mid-size saloon, relaunched in March this year, had a very strong month. The car sold 48.4 per cent more than in August 2004, while the modified 7-Series ? BMWs top of the line model ? increased deliveries by 29.3 per cent. Earlier this week, Mercedes Car Group, the premium division of DaimlerChrysler that includes its Smart and Maybach brands, reported a 12 per cent gain in August sales to 86,600 units, powered by a 15 per cent rise in Mercedes-Benz sales.

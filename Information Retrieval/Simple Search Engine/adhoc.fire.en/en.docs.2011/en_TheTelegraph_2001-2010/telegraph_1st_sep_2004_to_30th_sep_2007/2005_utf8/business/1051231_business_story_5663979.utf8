 Plan to ease rules on limited partnership

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 30: India Inc wants the government to allow limited liability partnerships (LLPs) to invest in listed or unlisted companies and attract investments from foreign firms.

 There should be no restriction from investing in listed or unlisted companies, as this increases the scope and nature of investments, said the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 The chamber recently submitted a 13-point agenda to the ministry of company affairs, which has released a concept paper on LLPs.

 It has also urged the Centre to make a provision of insurance coverage for legal disputes regarding LLPs. 

 To protect the interest of persons who might have claims against an LLP, UK laws have provisions for compulsory insurance policy for satisfaction of judgement and decrees against the LLP to a reasonable extent. Provisions on compulsory insurance should be incorporated in the LLP legislation in India as well, the chamber said.

 The industry feels it is necessary to align LLP legislation in India with other economic laws by making appropriate amendments or clarifications to the Foreign Exchange Management Act and foreign direct investment guidelines.

 The paper also sought reduction in government control over LLPs. Section 57 of the concept paper provides that the central government can direct that any provisions of the Companies Act, 1956 shall apply to any LLP with such exception, modification and adaptation, Ficci said.

 This would lead to a LLP being governed by the companies act just like a private company. 

 It has suggested that the governments discretion in this regard be reduced by making suitable provisions in the LLP act.

 As a first step, the industry feels small-and medium-sized LLPs should be introduced and relaxation provided from disclosure and filing requirements and from compliance with accounting standards by making suitable provisions in the LLP legislation.

 Gradually, these can be extended to all LLPs to make the structure more attractive, it added. 

 Also, India Inc sought a stamp duty relaxation on conversion of existing partnerships of private and unlisted public companies to LLPs, on the lines of similar laws in the UK.

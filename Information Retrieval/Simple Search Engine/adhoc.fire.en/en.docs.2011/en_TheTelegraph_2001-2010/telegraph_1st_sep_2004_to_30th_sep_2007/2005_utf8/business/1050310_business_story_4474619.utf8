 Call for ferro alloy duty cut rollback

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 9: The ferro alloy industry wants a rollback in the import duty cut announced in the budget. It feels that the duty cut will affect Orissa, Bengal and Chhattisgarh since most of the units are located there.

 Customs duty on ferro alloys was brought down to 10 per cent from 15 per cent. According to the Indian Ferro Alloy Producers Association, during the last 13 months, import duties have come down by 15 per cent as the previous government had brought it down to 20 per cent from 25 per cent.

 ?The duty cut has been too severe and at a rapid pace, which will flood the country with imports and adversely affect the industry,? the association said. Further, the strengthening of the rupee against the dollar is also expected to lead to larger imports of ferro alloys into the country. The association, which has sought restoration of import duties to 15 per cent, said ferro alloy is a power intensive industry and power spends account for 40-70 per cent of the total cost of production.

 Oracle to buy most of i-flex

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 2: Oracle Inc will shell out around $909 million (about Rs 4,000 crore) to buy a majority stake in i-flex Solutions. 

 Describing i-flex as the hottest software company in the banking industry, Oracle chief executive officer Larry Ellison said the US-based company would acquire Citigroup Venture Capital Internationals 41 per cent ownership stake in i-flex for $593 million.

 The deal brings big gains to Citigroup Ventures, which pumped in just $400,000 as venture capital in Rajesh Hukkus i-flex about 13 years ago and is now exiting the venture with $593 million in pocket.

 Oracle will pick up another 20 per cent through an open offer at Rs 882.62 per share, which will add up to $316 million if the entire 20 per cent is offered, Oracles chief financial officer Greg Maiffei said.

 The offer price of Rs 882.62, which is at a 6 per cent premium to a 30-day average price of stock, is attractive, quot; Maiffei said.

 Oracles deal comes close on the heels of another billion dollar buyout in the country where Essar Teleholdings of the Ruias snapped up a controlling stake in BPL Communications for Rs 4400 crore (just over $1 billion).

 Ellison said: Banking is a strategic industry for us with nine out of the top 10 banks already running Oracle ERP applications. The companys overall application strategy is to go beyond ERP and offer industry-specific functionality. i-flex gets us there in banking.

 The current i-flex management team would continue to run the company and will align product development, sales marketing, and services activities with Oracle, whose president Charles Philips would join the i-flex board.

 The i-flex stock would continue to be traded on the premier bourses ? BSE and NSE.

 Oracle said the transaction was subject to various regulatory clearances, including the approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board and the Reserve Bank of India. The transaction was expected to close by the end of 2005.

 After acquiring a majority holding, Oracle plans to integrate the accounts of i-flex with its financials.

 Philips said this investment brings together complementary technology to offer customers the most comprehensive banking solution for next generation applications, technology and services.

 i-flex has provided software and services to 575 banks in 115 countries and has over 5,500 employees worldwide.

 i-flex chairman Rajesh Hukku said the company would continue to operate its services business.

 Screws turn on crash engineers

 Mumbai, Jan. 7: Four entities have been identified for their alleged involvement in the May 17 stock market carnage that saw shareholders losing a whopping Rs 1,24,005 crore in the biggest-ever intra-day plunge.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram said show-cause notices have been issued to these firms, but was silent on their identities. Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairman G N Bajpai said the disclosures would come only after its probe is completed and action taken.

 Speaking to reporters at a function to launch BSE?s IndoNext, a trading platform for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the minister said action has been initiated against four entities whose names Sebi would reveal.

 Later, as Chidambaram went around the regulator?s south Mumbai hub, Bajpai said: ?The finance minister said the regulator could give names. However, I will not do so until the inquiry is over and an order has been passed.?

 Stock markets saw one of their bloodiest days on May 17, just when the Congress and its allies won the elections. The sensex plunged 550 points in the first 17 minutes, forcing authorities to suspend trading to bring order. When it opened more than an hour later, another 230 points were knocked off the key market barometer. The 780-point crash triggered yet another shutdown.

 However, when the markets re-opened the second time, the BSE index recovered some of its losses with institutions led by the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) making heavy purchases. Even so, the index ended 564 points lower than its previous close, making the slide the steepest after the 570-point crash during the 1992 securities scam. 

 That fateful day, the sensex opened at 5020.89 and plummeted to 4227.50 before winding down to 4505.16, a loss of 564.71 points or 11.14 per cent.

 The crash forced Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to publicly exhort allies to exercise restraint in their statements. He had said the new government would not hesitate to take action against those who seek to manipulate the market and create unnecessary panic. 

 Singh held out the reassurance that his government would persist with reforms ? a bone of contention with the Left parties and, hence, a fear for those in the market. Soon after, the regulator began an investigation to get to its bottom and identify entities responsible.

IndoNext

 IndoNext, which Chidambaram launched today, is a joint project of BSE and the Federation of Indian Stock Exchanges, representing 18 regional bourses in the country.

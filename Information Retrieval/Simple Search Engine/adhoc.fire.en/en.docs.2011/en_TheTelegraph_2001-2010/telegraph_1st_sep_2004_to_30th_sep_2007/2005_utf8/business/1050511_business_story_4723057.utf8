 SEZ bill suffers no labour pain

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 10: The Lok Sabha today passed the special economic zone (SEZ) bill after the Left parties forced the government to drop the clause on labour law, which would have relaxed labour norms in these zones to the point where even statutory benefits would have been jettisoned. 

 The bill was passed by a voice vote after commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath brought an amendment to delete section 50 (b) in this regard.

 According to this section, a state government could enact a law ?directing that any act relating to trade unions, industrial and labour disputes, welfare of labour, including conditions of work, provident fund, employers liability, workmens compensation, invalidity, old age pension and maternity benefits, shall not apply to SEZs?.

 The Left parties had mounted pressure on the commerce minister, at a meeting held before the introduction of the bill, where he agreed to drop this clause.

 CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta expressed satisfaction over the deletion of the controversial clause and said, ?this showed that the UPA co-ordination is working well.? 

 The clause was aimed at creating a system based on the Chinese model of cheap labour to help Indian exporters cut costs. 

 Winding up the discussion on the bill, Nath promised that the government would not allow any violation of labour laws within SEZs and the umbrella legislation was aimed at stepping up investment, both domestic and foreign, besides employment generation.

 He said India cannot ape other countries and has to have its own model and the SEZ bill is tailored to suit the Indian conditions. 

 The Left parties also wanted another amendment in the bill to ensure that state governments were not bypassed while setting up SEZs in their respective areas. 

 However, the commerce minister assured them that even though the bill provided the mandatory sovereign right to set up SEZ anywhere in the country, the Centre would always consult and collaborate with state governments while setting up such zones.

 The Left parties wanted the necessary amendments to incorporate this assurance while bringing the bill in the Rajya Sabha in the next few days. Nath said the government would instead build in the necessary provisions while framing the rules under the bill. 

 The ?biggest challenge? India faced was how to achieve incremental employment generation as the countrys agriculture cannot afford to sustain 600 million people dependent on it for their livelihood, he added.

 He quoted a study, which said $80-billion exports in 2004-05 have helped the country step up employment substantially.

 The exports-led growth adopted in China has generated substantial employment besides attracting a large quantum of foreign direct investment, he added. 

 He said a large number of the 34 SEZs have not yet taken off mainly because there was no ?credible legislative backing? and the passage of this ?path-breaking legislation? would enable the country attract large foreign and domestic investments needed to push up employment.

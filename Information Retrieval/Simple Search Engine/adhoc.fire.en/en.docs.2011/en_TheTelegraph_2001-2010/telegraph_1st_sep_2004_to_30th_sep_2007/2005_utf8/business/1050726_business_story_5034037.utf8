 Raymond bets big on exports

 Singhania: New horizon

 Bangalore, July 25: Raymond Ltd has launched a Rs 800-crore expansion programme to ramp up exports in the post-quota regime.

 The Mumbai-based company will infuse the funds, its highest investment in the last five years, to increase capacity as well as foray into a new product range.

 The worlds our market. We have no experience in making garments. Now, quotas have gone and curbs on SSIs have been lifted. We are gearing up to take advantage of this. With skilled labour, world-class manufacturing facilities and cost-effective product range, we want to offer end-to-end solutions in textiles, Gautam Hari Singhania, chairman and managing director, said today.

 From April, Raymond will step up its ring denim capacity at the Yavatmal facility in Maharashtra to 40 million metres a year from 30 million at an investment of Rs 99 crore. 

 We have chosen denims as a thrust area to enter the global market in a big way, Singhania said.

 The textiles business contributes 80 per cent, or Rs 1,600 crore, of Raymonds total revenue of Rs 2,000 crore. Last fiscal, the company had earned an export revenue of Rs 300 crore. This year, it has set a target of Rs 450 crore.

 Singhania was talking to reporters at the opening of the jeans-wear facility of Raymonds subsidiary Everblue Apparel Ltd, at Dodaballapur, near Bangalore. 

 Set up at an investment of Rs 45 crore on a 14.5-acre plot, the plant has an installed capacity of 3 million pairs of jeans a year for the exports market. It will employ about 1,000 people with majority being women from the neighbouring villages.

 The investment in Everblue Apparel will help us move up the value-chain by being an integrated supplier of fabric and garments to the exports market, he said. The company has also commissioned a facility at Hoskote, near Bangalore, for making 3,000 formal shirts a day.

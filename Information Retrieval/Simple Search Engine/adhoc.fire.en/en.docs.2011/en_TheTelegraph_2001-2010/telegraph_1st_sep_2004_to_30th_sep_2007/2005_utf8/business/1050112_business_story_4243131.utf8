 Rejig pill for co-ops

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Jan. 11: A task force, set up by the Centre to formulate a plan of action to rejuvenate the rural co-operative credit structure, has recommended institutional and financial restructuring.

 The task force was formed to look into the dwindling share of co-operative banks and institutions in the growing credit volume in rural areas. 

 The panel, headed by A. Vaidyanathan, emeritus professor, Madras Institute of Development Studies, called for democratic, member-driven, autonomous and self-reliant institutions.

 It also recommended radical changes in the legal framework to empower the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to improve the personnel in these institutions qualitatively ?through capacity building and other interventions, leading to an increase in overall efficiency?.

 According to the panel, this package needs to be implemented in a way that will improve the co-operative credit structures.

 The panel felt that financial restructuring of the co-operative credit structures should be exhaustive and re-engineering must cover all the tiers of these institutions. 

 ?Recapitalisation and restructuring the intermediate and upper tiers of the co-operative credit structure, without addressing the infirmities at the primary level, would defeat the objectives,? the task force said. 

 Primary agricultural co-operative societies (PACS) are the foundation of the short-term credit structure and their poor financial health and organisational deficiencies cause the weakness of the upper tiers.

 The panel, therefore, said the revival package must include assistance for PACS to help them ?evolve into democratic, self-governing and financially well-managed institutions?. 

 It also said a criteria should be evolved to identify eligible institutions as there are a large number of credit co-operatives at the base level.

 The resource support for recapitalisation should be recommended with utmost caution, the panel added. 

 Regarding the non-viable, dormant and defunct credit co-operatives, the panel said options such as mergers, amalgamations or closure should be looked at.

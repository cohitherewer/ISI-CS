 Tata Metalik gains ground

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 25: Tata Metalik has got a 350-acre plot adjacent to its existing plant in Kharagpur.

 TML has been offered the land recently and the company will make the payment for the same soon, said Harsh K. Jha, managing director of the company.

 The Tata company has been looking for 500 acres of contiguous land for expansion. But it could get only 350 acre. TML intends to diversify into steel making and plans to set up a long product facility there.

 The land would suffice for a 0.5-million tonne expansion. However, This will limit our single site expansion. In case, we need to expand further, a new location has to be found out, Jha said at the sidelines of a CII meet in Calcutta on Saturday.

 West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) will acquire the land for the company and hand it over to it.

 The plot is a single crop farmland that would be offered to the company. Jha said the pre-feasibility report has already been done. The detail report would be ready by November and the company would take a decision on the configuration, capacity and the investment after that.

 Even as a single site facility makes the operations far easier, the company is also open to expand to a new location if it is economic to the company. The development highlights the scarcity of land dogging the industry in Bengal. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has gone on record saying that the state was unable to cope up with the demand for land.

 New Delhi, Sept. 9: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said a Rs 15,000-crore package would be created for restructuring rural co-operative banks. The fund would be borne by the Centre, states and the co-operative banks themselves.

 While speaking at a conclave of chief minister on rural credit Singh indicated that either a separate regulatory body would be formed to regulate co-operative banks or the Reserve Bank of India may directly regulate them. 

 Co-operative banks, which are in shambles financially, are currently regulated through a mechanism that has the RBI regulating them through the Registrar of Co-operative Societies.

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram hinted that the Centre would like to opt for the package proposed by the expert committee. The panel recommended the government should share about 53 per cent of the fund for revamping the rural co-operative credit infrastructure. I am delighted that in a matter of three and half hours we have reached a near consensus and agreed to make it happen in 3-6 weeks, Chidambaram said.

 However, a majority of the chief ministers present at the conclave demanded a higher Central share in the outlay.

 The states also raised objections on the governments recommendations on the eligibility norms for receiving the revival package. 

 They suggested that it should be broad-based and cover all ailing co-operative societies.

 The Prime Minister also said if Indian economy has to grow at a rate of 7-8 per cent per annum, farm sector has to grow at about 4 per cent annually. 

 He pointed out that this was difficult as the rural credit infrastructure was in a mess. 

 The contribution of co-operatives to the supply of farm credit has dropped sharply from about 70 per cent to about 30 per cent. This has contributed to rural distress in large sections of our farming community. The problem of declining institutional credit for agriculture has been a common and persistent complaint of farmers in distress, Singh said.

 Singh said the re-engineering framework for co-operative banks, as proposed by the expert panel, was based on a bottom up approach.

 Financial restructuring would have to be from a mix of resources from the Central government, the states and co-operative credit institutions themselves. Where state governments are not in a position to provide funds towards their share of the package, they may be allowed to raise resources through market borrowings or similar sources, he added. 

 The finance minister suggested that the Centre and states would fix the minimum capital adequacy ratio for co-operative banks. States should also work out a scheme for retiring their share capital to provide greater operational autonomy to co-operatives, as suggested by the panel, he mentioned.

 The panel has recommended a minimum 7 per cent CAR initially, which has to be increased to 12 per cent in five years.

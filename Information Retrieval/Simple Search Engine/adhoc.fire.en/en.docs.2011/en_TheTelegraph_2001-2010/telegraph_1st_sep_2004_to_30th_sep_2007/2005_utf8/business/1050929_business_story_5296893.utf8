 Hungry GAIL on the prowl

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Banerjee: Focussed 

 New Delhi, Sept. 28: GAIL (India) is looking at acquiring a small to medium-sized oil and gas exploration company in India or abroad and is mulling to take part in the Rs 25,000-crore Nabucco pipeline project connecting central Europe to the Caspian Sea. This is part of the gas utilitys plan to go global.

 GAIL chairman Proshanto Banerjee told newspersons here on the sidelines of the companys annual general meeting that it had received some takeover proposals through banks. He, however, refused to divulge further details on investments or time limit for the acquisition, but claimed that the funds would not be a constraint for the takeover.

 The acquisition of an oil and gas exploration company would help GAIL in gaining skill sets required for upstream activities, Banerjee said.

 It, however, remains to be seen whether the Union petroleum ministry would clear the proposal as the latest report on synergy in energy has come out which favours that the hydrocarbon companies should stick to their core competence. The panel has also recommended that Oil India Ltd and Indian Oil Corporation should be combined for expansion in the upstream business alongside Oil and Natural Gas Corporation.

 GAIL has a participating interest in 14 exploration blocks and it expects to get an operators licence soon either for a fresh block or for an existing block in the Cambay basin.

 With a focus on oil and gas exploration business, the gas utility has earmarked an investment of Rs 800 crore over the next two years.

 Along with ONGC, GAIL has a 20 per cent stake in A-1 block in Myanmar and the two companies expect to sign an agreement on October 4 for a stake in A-3 block. Production from A-1 block is expected to start in three years time, Banerjee said.

 GAIL shared the LPG and kerosene subsidy burden worth Rs 320 crore during the first half of this fiscal. For the entire 12 months period last fiscal, it was Rs 1,147 crore. 

 Banerjee also disclosed that the company was in talks with countries like Australia, Malaysia, Oman and Qatar to source gas and LNG supply for Dabhol and other power projects.

 Essar Power to boost capacity

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, May 6: Essar Power would augment its power generation capacity from 515 megawatts to 2000 MW at a total investment of Rs 4,000 crore. Having consolidated its operations, the company is now planning a foray into the power distribution sector.

 Cost-cutting measures and operational efficiencies implemented simultaneously by the power utility firm has paid off as net profits vaulted 97 per cent to Rs 119 crore last fiscal compared with Rs 60 crore in the previous year. Total income rose 34 per cent to Rs 735 crore from Rs 549 crore.

 ?We have consolidated our operations. Now, we are expanding capacities and also planning to enter the power distribution sector,? said A. K. Srivastava, managing director of Essar Power.

 The company has finalised plans to raise the power generation capacity from 515 MW to 2000 MW at an investment of Rs 4,000 crore, which works out to approximately Rs 2.7 crore per MW. 

 Recent reports have stated that the company has signed a debt syndication agreement with the US Exim Bank for Rs 1,200 crore to part-finance its proposed 1500-MW power plant at Hazira.

 Essar Power is the countrys first independent power producer in the private sector and enjoys the lowest manpower-to-megawatt ratio.

 ?Successful transition from high-cost naphtha to natural gas from April 2004 under long-term supply agreements ensured significant cost reduction and guaranteed supply of gas,? stated a release issued by the company.

 ?Plant load factor went up to 93 per cent from 86 per cent last year, which was the highest ever since the company commenced operations,? the statement added. 

 These measures had a positive impact on the company as the profit before interest, depreciation and tax surged 15 per cent to Rs 414 crore against Rs 360 crore earned in the previous year. 

 The company has incurred an interest cost of Rs 175 crore, while depreciation shaved off Rs 117 crore.

 Due to its thrust on reducing costs and operational efficiencies, Essar Powers operations witnessed some significant positive changes.

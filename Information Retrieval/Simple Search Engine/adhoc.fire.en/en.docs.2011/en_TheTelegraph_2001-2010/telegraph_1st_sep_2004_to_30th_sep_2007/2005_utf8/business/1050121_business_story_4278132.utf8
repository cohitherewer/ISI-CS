 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Bangalore, Jan. 20: United Breweries? shareholders today approved the acquisition of Karnataka Breweries amp; Distilleries Ltd for Rs 180 crore as part of the company?s strategy to expand its brewing capacity.

 At the extraordinary general meeting held here, UB chairman Vijay Mallya told shareholders that the acquisition of Karnataka Breweries (KBDL) would enhance the company?s brewing capacity between 7.5 lakh hecto litres (HL) and 1 million HL. Out of the 6 million cases of beer sold in Karnataka, 4.5 million cases were sourced from KBDL, catering to 75 per cent of the market. 

 KBDL?s strategic location on the outskirts of the city and its capacity will serve UB?s long-term interests and add value to the shareholders. UB enjoys 50 per cent market share in the beer segment. 

 ?The acquisition will enable UB to consolidate its brewing operations in Karnataka and help achieve synergies and leverage economies of scale. The new chairman and managing director of KBDL will be appointed soon,? Mallya said.

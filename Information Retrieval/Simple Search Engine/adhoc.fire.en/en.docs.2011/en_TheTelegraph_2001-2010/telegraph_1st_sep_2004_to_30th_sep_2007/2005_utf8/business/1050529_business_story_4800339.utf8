 General Motors picks up speed in China 

 Clarke: Road to resurgence (Reuters)

 Shanghai, May 28 (Reuters): General Motors Corporations flagship China venture opened a new plant in Shanghai on Saturday that brought its nationwide production capacity to almost half a million units in an increasingly competitive market.

 The new facility, a part of General Motors (GM) $3-billion investment blueprint with its Chinese partners, is capable of churning out 160,000 medium-sized Buick Excelle sedans and could produce its Cadillac STS luxury sedans in the future.

 Operations at the plant, located on the outskirts of Shanghais financial district, began on Saturday, the US automaker said.

 There is no country more important than China for the auto market, said GMs Asia Pacific chief, Troy Clarke, at the inauguration of the plant.

 Clarke said Chinas auto market would develop faster than any other market in the world in the next 10 years but did not elaborate.

 He had previously said the Chinese market would grow through the end of the decade at an average annual rate of 10 percent.

 The new facility doubles the ventures capacity in Shanghai to 320,000 units and brings its nationwide capacity to 480,000 vehicles.

 Global auto makers including Ford Motor Company, Nissan Motor Company and Toyota Motor Corporation are investing $15 billion to triple annual production in China to seven million cars by 2008, triggering fears of a glut.

 China has been a rare bright spot for embattled GM, but the market began slowing down from the middle of last year when Beijing hiked curbs on easy car loans and implemented other measures to cool the economy. Before that, sales averaged double-digit growth as the growing middle class took to the roads.

 Crude crosses $58, Opec to loosen taps

 Oil boils

 London, April 4 (Reuters): Oil prices raced to all-time peaks on Monday, climbing above $58 a barrel, while Opec producers said they had begun discussing a second output hike to try to quell the market?s rally.

 US light crude for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange hit a nominal record of $58.28 a barrel. It later eased slightly to trade 23 cents higher at $57.50.

 London?s Brent crude was 69 cents higher at $57.20, down from a new peak of $57.65.

 NYMEX crude oil for September delivery ? trading at a premium to the front month ? hit $60.05, the first time a futures contract has topped $60.

 Prices have surged since a forecast last week by Goldman Sachs bank that oil could spike above $100 as global demand growth strains supply capacity.

 Opec president Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah said on Monday cartel oil ministers had begun telephone consultations on possibly increasing production by a further 500,000 barrels per day to cool prices. 

 ?If there is a decision it should be in the next two weeks. For that, if there will be any new production, it should be in May,? said Sheikh Ahmad, also Kuwait?s energy minister.

 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries raised output limits by 500,000 barrels per day (BPD) to 27.5 million BPD in mid-March and left room for a second increase before a June ministerial meeting if prices failed to ease below $55.

 The European Commission on Monday also said it had raised its 2005 price forecast to $50.9 a barrel for Brent, up from an earlier forecast of $45.1.

 In real terms, prices were still higher in the 1980s when they peaked at roughly $90 a barrel in today?s money for US crude, according to calculations by the International Energy Agency, using the US Consumer Price Index as an inflation adjuster.

 Nigerian presidential advisor on Petroleum Edmund Daukoru said on Sunday the increase could happen within two weeks if prices stayed above $55 for at least the next 10 to 14 days.

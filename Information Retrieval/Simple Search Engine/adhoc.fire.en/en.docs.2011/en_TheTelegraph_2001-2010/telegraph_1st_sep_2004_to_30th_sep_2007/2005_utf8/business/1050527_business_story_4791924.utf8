 Calcutta, May 26: Tata Teleservices (TTSL) will invest Rs 600 crore in the current fiscal to expand its network in the Calcutta, Bengal, Orissa and Bihar (including Jharkhand) circles.

 TTSL (east) chief operating officer Rajesh Puri said, The investment will mainly be used to install 350-400 cell sites in addition to the 500 that are already in place in the east. This will facilitate our service rollout plans to 350 towns by March next year from 80 at present. We are also laying 2000 km of fibre optic to ensure seamless coverage along the highways.

 TTSL also plans to launch its services in north Bengal next month.

 Besides increasing its mobile and fixed line business, the company is also focussing on niche products.

 We have recently introduced VoData cards, which allow a laptop user to stay connected at 156 kbps while on the move, said Puri. We are targeting corporate users and are also in talks with distributors and sellers of laptops for bundled offers.

 A VoData card allows a user to stay connected either through voice, data or messaging and costs Rs 10,000.

 Another major focus area is public telephone booths, said Puri. TTSL has set up more than 2500 booths in the city. This is expected to go up to 13,000 by the fiscal-end. There are currently around 4000 booths in the east. We plan to promote the business and have set a target for 55,000 units by March next year.

 The company also plans to set up Re 1 coin booths with a 60-second pulse in the city.

 Energy brake ahead on growth track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Nov 6: Picture this: Indias oil reserves will run out in 22 years, its gas reserves in 30 years and its much-vaunted coal reserves in 80 years. And thats going by the current rate of production.

 If that sounds dire, theres worse: the coal reserves will be gone in less than 40 years if India manages to grow its economy at a robust 8 per cent a year -- a target that the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government has set for itself.

 The bleak future has been painted in a draft report on the energy policy prepared by Kirit S. Parekh, member (energy) of the Planning Commission and it doesnt make for pretty reading.

 The report says much will depend on how quickly the country can manage to harness alternative energy sources, including nuclear, hydel, bio fuels and solar energy.

 The potential for renewable energy source is huge. It estimates that wind energy can generate 10 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe) and energy plantations could contribute 30 to 60 mtoe from about 10 million hectares. This has a double benefit in that it will generate employment and will also provide income in the form of carbon credits that can be sold at 20 euros per tonne of carbon dioxide. Solar energy could chip in with a handy 2.4 billion tonnes of oil equivalent for 10 million hectares, says the report.

 The oil import bill will continue to be fairly large with an assumed import of 66 to 90 per cent of the total oil requirement of 303 to 360 million tonnes in the year 2031-32. The assumed domestic production will be just a piffle at 35 to 100 million tonnes.

 Natural gas (including coalbed methane) imports will be anywhere from zero to 66 per cent against a requirement of 77 to 290 million tonnes. The range is pretty wide because it is difficult to say what the fuel matrix will be with much depending on how the alternative fuels are harnessed.

 Coal imports are also expected to amount to anywhere between zero and 48 per cent of the total requirement of 621 to 1200 million tonnes of oil equivalent (mtoe).

 One of the biggest challenges will be to maximise nuclear power capacity from 2.7 GW at present to 63 GW. The report says imports of nuclear fuel and plants will be necessary to make it a real option. By 2050, the installed capacity for nuclear power could swell to 275 GW in an optimistic scenario or remain at 208 GW in a pessimistic one.

 Coal supplies will pose challenges while trying to cope with the huge energy needs of the country. Coal production will have to increase by four to five times current levels and the rail capacity to move the coal will also have to rise by three to four times. This will depend crucially on the ability to attract private sector and other public sector units into coal mining. It suggests that captive mining rules be liberalised and wants coal energy enhanced through coal bed methane and in-situ gasification.

 In the case of natural gas production, the challenge is to raise production from 29 mtoe to 220 to 330 mtoe. The Reliance and GSPC reserves must be proved and put into production. Alternatively, 40 to 54 Petronet size (5 mt) LNG terminals must be imported.

 Electricity requirements will balloon and it says that the system will not be able to cope unless the distribution losses are curtailed. Power generating capacity in the country will have to increase from 780 GW to 131 GW in 25 years, says the report. 

 The report has also suggested the need to frame policies that will help achieve the objective of providing electricity to all in five years time and clean cooking energy to all in the next 10 years.

 It has said that all power generation projects in the Ninth Plan and beyond must be bid out competitively on level terms. There should be a separation of content from carriage in both transmission and distribution. There should also be independent and transparent load dispatch centres at regional and state levels.

 In the area of coal, it wants an independent regulatory body and the abolition of coal linkages. It wants the coal sector to be conferred industry status, suggests an increase in the number of players in mining and wants group captive mines for small end-users.

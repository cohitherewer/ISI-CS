 Customs mop-up swells

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 29: Calcutta Customs has posted a sharp growth of 34.52 per cent in revenue collection at Rs 4,489 crore for the financial year ended March 31.

 After a period of 10-12 years, last year, we surpassed the target revenue collection given to us by the ministry of finance, said Subrata Basu, chief commissioner of customs, Calcutta. He was speaking at a workshop organised by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce on the help-centre set up by Calcutta Customs.

 In 2004-05, revenue collection was Rs 1,014 crore more than the previous year, while the actual collection was Rs 80 crore more than the target fixed by the ministry.

 Considering the revenue collected in the first quarter of 2005-06, Calcutta Customs expects to maintain the same pace of growth this year too, Basu said. 

 The target set by the ministry of finance for the current fiscal is Rs 4,390 crore.

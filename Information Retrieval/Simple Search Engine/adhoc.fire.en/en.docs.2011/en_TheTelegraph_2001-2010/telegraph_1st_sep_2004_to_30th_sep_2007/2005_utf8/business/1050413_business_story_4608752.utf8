 Videocon logs into infotech

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, April 12: Videocon will soon submit a proposal to the Bengal government for an IT facility here as part of its planned foray into the information technology sector. 

 Sources in the group said the company has decided to restructure its manufacturing facilities in Bengal and also set up an IT facility at its Salt Lake factory, which manufactures printed circuit boards, colour televisions and refrigerators. The factory was bought by Videocon from Philips for Rs 9 crore.

 Senior officials of Videocon said: ?There is a lot of space inside the Salt Lake factory, which can be used for the IT venture.?

 Group chief Venugopal Dhoot is expected to submit a formal proposal to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee on April 28 when the latter inaugurates Videocon?s Taratolla factory.

 Sources said efforts will also be made to persuade the state government to participate in the IT venture with a token equity.

 The Taratolla factory, which was bought from Philips, will produce picture tube glass, personal computers (both desktop and laptop), washing machines (automatic and semi-automatic) and microwave ovens. The factory used to be the bulb manufacturing unit of Philips. 

 The Videocon group will enter the personal computer business by setting up its first production base at Taratolla. 

 Videocon will invest Rs 100 crore to manufacture glass shells for picture tubes at the Taratolla factory. The unit will be under Kitchen Appliances, a group company. The glass shells will be sent to the Bharuch factory where picture tubes are made. The company plans to raise the picture tube capacity at Bharuch from 1.5 crore to 3 crore in the coming years.

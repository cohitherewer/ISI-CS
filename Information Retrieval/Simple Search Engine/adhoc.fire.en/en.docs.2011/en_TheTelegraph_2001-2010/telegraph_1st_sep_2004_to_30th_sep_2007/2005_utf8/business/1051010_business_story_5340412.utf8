 CDMA buzz gets louder

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Calcutta, Oct. 9: The city gives CDMA operators a leg up. The Calcutta circle has recorded the highest number of GSM subscribers switching over to a CDMA connection within a given period of time.

 Sources in Reliance Infocomm say that out of the net increase in its subscribers every month, an average of 10,000 are GSM users. Of this, around 60 per cent are post-paid customers. 

 Tata Teleservices, which launched its services in December last year, is also targeting high-end GSM users and has managed to grow the churn rate rapidly.

 We faced a lot of problems in billing and had many dissatisfied customers. Once this issue was solved, subscribers have shown their faith in CDMA, said a Reliance source. Also, the introduction of the prepaid facility gives subscribers the same options as in GSM.

 The preferences are evident from the fact that while AirTel has added only 1525 subscribers between July and August this year, a new entrant Tata Teleservices registered 9107 subscribers during the same period. Tata Teleservicess subscriber base has grown from 63039 to 72146.

 Hutch, however, has been maintaining a steady pace with its subscriber base increased by 26788 during the one-month time. Even BSNL has managed to add 11965 subscribers.

 In contrast, Reliance Infocomm has increased its number of subscribers to 170250 in August from 161018 in July this year. 

 CDMA players are also aggressively focussing on highlighting the data enabled features of their handsets.

 The R-World facility is available on most of the handsets, even in the entry-level ones, says the Reliance source. 

 Also there is no monthly charge for R-World. One has to pay only for the specific data downloads, the charges for which are mentioned before the download, the source adds.

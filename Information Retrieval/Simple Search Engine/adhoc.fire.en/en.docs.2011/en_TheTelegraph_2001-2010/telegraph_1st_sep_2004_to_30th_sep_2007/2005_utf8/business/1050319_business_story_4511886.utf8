 Minority Malco investors spoil promoters? mood

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 18: The minority shareholders of Madras Aluminium Company Ltd are asking for an offer price much higher than the floor rate of Rs 181 per share fixed by the promoters.

 The highlight of the reverse book building, which ended today, was an offer made by Tamil Nadu Investment Corporation at Rs 2091 per share, a 1055 per cent premium over the floor price.

 ?That?s an incredulous and a frivolous offer,? a source associated with the exercise said regarding the price quoted by Tamil Nadu Investment Corporation.

 ?The state government undertaking is a competent authority as it was a joint collaborator of Malco, a Vedanta Resources group company, and so it should know the value of the company,? Kirit Somaiya, former MP and president of the Investors Grievances Forum, said. Somaiya has been conducting a campaign against the floor price fixed in Malco?s reverse book building, alleging that it was very low. 

 We have demanded action against Malco as we feel the promoters have undervalued the shares, Somaiya said.

 They have also not revealed material information on the value of the investments with Malco, he said.

 Meanwhile, today none of the shareholders have indicated a price around the floor price and much of the bids have come in the region of Rs 240-300.

 Only 50 per cent responded to the reverse book building offer, according to the National Stock Exchange. The total offers received from minority shareholders were for 22,48,216 shares, while the offer size was for 45 lakh shares.

 According to sources, ICICI Securities ? the investment bankers to the deal ? will decide on the final pricing only on Tuesday. ?We have to wait for the offers made by shareholders holding shares in the physical form,? they added. Only then can we say whether the issue was a flop or not.

 In fact, the Investors Grievances Forum has alleged that the Sterlite Group, a part of Vedanta Resources, has again adopted anti-small investor attitude.

 The present offer by Vedanta ? Twin Star for Malco shares at the floor price of Rs 181 ? has been made without proper valuation.

 Some investors were miffed because Malco owns 51.22 lakh shares, which has a market price over Rs 700 crore. The IGF said the Sterlite shares alone account for Rs 400 crore.

 However, Sterlite sources say the investors? forum has not considered the contingent liabilities of Malco, which is around Rs 400 crore.

 Somaiya told The Telegraph that he has visited New Delhi to meet officials from the finance ministry and department of company affairs to raise the issue.

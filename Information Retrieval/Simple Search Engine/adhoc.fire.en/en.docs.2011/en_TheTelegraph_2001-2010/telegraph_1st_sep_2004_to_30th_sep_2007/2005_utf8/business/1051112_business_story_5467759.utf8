 Stocks pick up speed, 400 points in a week

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 11: Buoyed by signs that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) are returning, markets won back their winning streak with a 162-point leap in the sensex, which ended at a one-month high of 8471.04 points.

 The two-week rally was also fuelled by strong trends overseas, where global crude prices cooled. This combined with good growth vibes from the finance minister.

 This afternoons surge takes to 398.29 points the gains scored on Dalal Street this week. Today, the 30-share index opened at 8,332.94 and hit an intra-day high of 8,483.68 before ending at 8,471.04 compared with 8,308.93 on Thursday, a rise of 1.95 per cent. The rally between October 31 and November 8 added 632 points or 8.23 per cent.

 Brokers said there was all-round buying, particularly in pharmaceuticals, banks, technology and auto stocks. A comforting factor, given the robust performance projected for the Indian economy, has been the buying by foreign institutional investors this month.

 The reversal in their strategy ? which had been to sell almost all of last month ? was borne out by Sebi figures. 

 That data showed that while FIIs were net sellers to the tune of Rs 137 crore on Thursday, they had been net buyers this month. The amount pumped in the first five trading days of November is more than Rs 1,674 crore, largely channelled into stocks throwing up good bargains.

 In overseas markets, Wall Street turned around smartly and Asian markets were firm. Japans nikkei ended up by 74.18 points, Hong Kongs hang seng 107.27 points, Taiwan 86.89 points and Koreas kospi 21.69 points. 

 One of the biggest boosters has been the drop in oil prices, and with it, the receding fears of a spurt in inflation. In early London trading today, crude was going for $57.52, much lower than the red-hot prices over $60. The decline was caused by figures that confirmed the US had bigger crude stockpiles than estimated.

 Meanwhile, the rupee recovered lost ground today, gaining nine paise over its last finish to around 45.69 against the dollar. The bounce was caused by faster FII flows into stocks and an increase in the supply of greenbacks. The dollar is now at two-year peaks against the euro and multi-month highs versus the yen.

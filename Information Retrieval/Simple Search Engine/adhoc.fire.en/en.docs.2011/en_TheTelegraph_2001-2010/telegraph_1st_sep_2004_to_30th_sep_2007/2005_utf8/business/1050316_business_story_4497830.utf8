The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Foreign investors have a sweet tooth

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Glad tidings

 Calcutta, March 15: Foreign institutional investors? (FII) interest in the domestic sugar companies is evident from the stakes scooped up by them through secondary market purchases and the preferential allotment route.

 Citicorp International Finance Corporation acquired 17.09 lakh shares of Balrampur Chini Mills, aggregating 7.37 per cent of the total paid-up capital, on March 11. The company had recently approved a preferential allotment of 19.33 lakh shares at Rs 585 apiece. As on December 31, 2004, the foreign shareholding in the company was 8.35 per cent, with Commonwealth Equity Fund holding 1.75 per cent and HSBC Global Investment Funds A/c HSBC Global Investment Funds Mauritius holding 2.59 per cent.

 Bear Stearns and Company A/c BSMA Limited, Bear Stearns and Company and Bear Stearns and Company A/c Acquamarine Fund Inc has acquired 0.11 per cent of the total share capital of Dwarikesh Sugar Industries Limited. In this case, the mode of acquisition was through secondary market purchase and the entities now hold 5.06 per cent of the total share capital of the company.

 Dwarikesh Sugar Industries Limited has also recently approved the issue of foreign convertible bonds and has authorised portfolio investment by foreign investors.

 Merrill Lynch Capital Market Espana S A SVB has acquired 0.08 per cent of the total paid-up capital of Sakthi Sugars through secondary market purchase. After the acquisition, the entity holds 5.02 per cent of the total paid-up capital of the company.

 Market sources said sufficient FII interest has also been shown in Bajaj Hindusthan Limited, Dhampur Sugar and EID Parry Limited.

 Bajaj Hindusthan has decided to raise funds up to $200 million from international or domestic market. In the last one year, the foreign shareholding in the firm rose from 0.27 per cent to 1.25 per cent.

 Also, for EID Parry, the foreign shareholding has increased from 4.5 per cent on September 30, 2004, to 6.07 per cent on December 31, 2004. In Dhampur Sugar, the foreign shareholding has increased from 11.35 per cent to 13.01 per cent in the last one year.

 Analysts said FIIs had in general shown substantial interest in the sugar stocks. However, as the institutions were earlier keen on large-cap stocks, such interest was not visible in the mid-cap sugar shares. But, with mid-cap stocks outperforming the market returns, the focus of FIIs has also shifted towards this category across all sectors.

 Among emerging markets, India and Brazil are the major sugar producing countries. Therefore, these are the available options for investment in sugar stocks.

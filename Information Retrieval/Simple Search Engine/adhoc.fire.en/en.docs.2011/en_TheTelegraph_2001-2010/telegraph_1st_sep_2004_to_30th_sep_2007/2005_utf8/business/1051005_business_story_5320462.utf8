 Calcutta, Oct. 4: Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd, popularly known as Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, has put its public issue plan on the backburner.

 The steel company has instead decided to go for the debt option to fund its Rs 8,200-crore expansion programme.

 RINLs board has approved the plan to increase capacity to 6.3 million tonnes (mt) by 2008 from the present level of 4 mt. 

 The Cabinet nod is also expected by the month-end, an RINL executive said in Calcutta today.

 The steel-maker had earlier mooted a 0.5:1 debt-equity mix to fund its capital expenditure. However, it had been advised by the ministry to go for higher borrowings given there was no dearth of liquidity in the market.

 We have decided to go for 1:1 debt-equity ratio now, H. S. Chhatwal, director (commercial) of RINL, said. The equity capital will be arranged through internal accruals only, he said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Steel Wire Manufacturers Association of India. 

 However, we are yet to decide on the modalities to raise the debt part. Once the Cabinet approval comes, the details would be worked out, he added.

 Bottomline hit

 Soaring raw material prices, especially that of coking coal, is likely to eat into RINLs profits.

 The price of imported coking coal has doubled in the last one year affecting the companys bottomline even as it was trying to offset the impact by increasing the volume of production.

 RINL had posted a net profit of Rs 2,008 crore in the last financial year on a turnover of Rs 8,181 crore.

 He said the company was planning to introduce coal dust injection in blast furnaces from the next fiscal which would lower its consumption of coking coal and help getting round the impact of the price rise. 

 The company is currently operating its plant overtime ? at 120 per cent capacity utilisation. And raw material cost contributes 53 per cent of its total production cost now.

 RINL is also focusing more on the value-added segment to improve its margin. Chhatwal said RINL would concentrate on the high-value steel for automobile segment.

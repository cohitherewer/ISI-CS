 Hyderabad, July 17: JSW Steel Ltd will step up its steel production to 10 million tonnes by 2010.

 We plan to invest Rs 1500 crore to increase our capacities. Internal accruals and borrowings will fund the project, JSW Steel executive director Vinod Nowal said.

 The OP Jindal group company has a 500-mw captive thermal power plant. We consume 50 per cent of power and sell the remaining to the Karnataka grid at Rs 2.60 per unit, he said.

 The JSW group will set up an aluminium plant at Vishakhapatnam at an investment of Rs 9000 crore.

 In June, the state government and JSW group chief Sajjan Jindal signed a memorandum of understanding in Hyderabad to complete the project in four years. 

 Andhra Pradesh Mineral Development Corporation (APMDC) will supply bauxite ore from the mines in the coastal district and also pick up a stake in the equity, said J. P. N. Lal, an executive director. 

 The APMDC will have a 51 per cent stake in the aluminium project and JSW Holdings will pick up the remaining 49 per cent, said Nowal. 

 He said a special purpose vehicle (SPV) will raise funds from the capital market for the project in the second phase. 

 JSW Steel proposes to invest Rs 3000 crore in the first phase in the next two years. We will fund it from internal accruals and financial institutions, he said.

 Airport plan

 The private airstrip of JSW Steel in Torangal will soon be converted into a commercial airport. 

 We have applied to the civil aviation ministry for licence and hope to procure it in a few months. All the procedural inspections are complete and our airstrip is adjudged fit enough for commercial operations, said Nowal. 

 He said the present airstrip was used by company executives and a nine-seater aircraft shuttled between Bangalore and the plant regularly. 

 We plan to tie up with Air Deccan to develop this into a full-fledged airport to help visitors to Hampi, which is 30 km away, he said.

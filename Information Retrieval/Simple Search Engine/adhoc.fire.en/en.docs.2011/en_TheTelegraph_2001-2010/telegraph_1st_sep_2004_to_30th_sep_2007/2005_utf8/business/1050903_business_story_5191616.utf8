 Separate window for block deals

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 2: The Securities and Exchange Board of India has permitted bourses to provide a separate trading window for transacting block deals for at least five lakh shares or a minimum value of Rs 5 crore. 

 A trade with a minimum quantity of five lakh shares or a minimum value of Rs 5 crore executed through a single transaction on this separate window would constitute a block deal as distinguished from bulk deals earlier, the market regulator said.

 Recently, Sebi had defined bulk deals as all transactions in a scrip (on an exchange) where total quantity of shares bought or sold is more than 0.5 per cent of the number of shares of the company listed on the exchange. 

 The window would be open for trading for a limited period of 35 minutes between 9.55 am and 10.30 am.

 Also orders may be placed in this window at a price not exceeding plus or minus 1 per cent from the ruling market price or previous day closing price.

 Sebi said every trade executed in this window must result in delivery and shall not be squared off or reversed, while disclosure of all trades in this window and its dissemination to general public has been mandated.

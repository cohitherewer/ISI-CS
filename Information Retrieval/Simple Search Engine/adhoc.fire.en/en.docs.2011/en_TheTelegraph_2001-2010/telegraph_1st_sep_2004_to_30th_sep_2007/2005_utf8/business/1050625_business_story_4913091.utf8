 Dividend drought ends

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 24: CESC today declared a dividend of 25 per cent after a gap of seven years. The move followed the clearance from lenders, led by ICICI Bank, to remove payout curbs.

 Under the corporate debt-restructuring (CDR) package, CESC was barred from paying dividends till March 2006. But as the company was able to meet the conditions set out in the package, the restriction was lifted earlier. The last payout by the company was at 20 per cent in 1996-97. 

 The lenders include domestic banks, financial institutions and multilateral funding agencies like IFC, ADB, CDC and Kleinworth Benson. 

 FI sources said the company had approached the lenders with a dividend proposal in 2004-05. The top brass of the company led by managing director Sumantra Banerjee had apprised the foreign lenders of the financial as well as operational performance of the company. 

 The net profit of the company increased to Rs 160 crore in 2004-05 from Rs 90 crore in the previous year. Its debt equity ratio improved to 1.4 and interest cost dropped 25 per cent, to Rs 256 crore from Rs 348 crore in 2003-04.

 Hutch ring gets louder

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Kharagpur, May. 6: Hutch plans to consolidate its services in Bengal circle before moving on to other circles in the eastern region. The cellular service provider has launched its GPRS service in south Bengal. 

 Speaking on the occasion, S. Murali, associate vice-president, sales and marketing operations, Hutchison East, said, ?We have registered 1.28 lakh subscribers in Bengal since our launch in November last year. The commencement of cellular services by Hutch and others has helped take the mobile penetration in the circle from below 0.5 per cent to over 1 per cent in the last six months. This is still poor compared to a over 4 per cent penetration in circles like Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.?

 Of the 13 circles where Hutch offers services, it covers only Calcutta and Bengal in the east.

 The cellular service provider currently has 210 cell sites with a capacity for two lakh connections in the Bengal circle and plans to double the number within the next 12 months.

 ?We are now present in 150 towns in Bengal out of the total 400 towns. We plan to take our services to 300 towns by mid-2006. With the expansion of the network, we expect the subscriber base to double every year over the next two years,? Murali added.

 The company, however, does not have a plan to launch its services in the Andaman amp; Nicobar Islands, which also come under the Bengal circle, as of now.

 Hutch has already invested Rs 150 crore in its Bengal operations and plans to pump in another Rs 150 crore in a phased manner.

 ?We have 30 teleshops and five exclusive Hutch outlets in the circle. We are also working on providing adequate services to customers and more outlets will be added depending on the demand,? Murali said.

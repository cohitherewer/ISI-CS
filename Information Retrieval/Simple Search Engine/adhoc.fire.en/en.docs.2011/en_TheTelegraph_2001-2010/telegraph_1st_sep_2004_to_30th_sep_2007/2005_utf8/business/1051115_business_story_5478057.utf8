 Job-funds tightrope in retail crawl

 New Delhi, Nov. 14: The Congress-led central government is working on a retail trade package that will address the Left?s concerns on job losses while trying to fulfil the need to bring foreign investment into the much-needed back-end infrastructure, such as cold chains.

 Indications to this effect came through at a Ficci seminar meant to showcase Bengal as an investment destination but where Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and commerce minister Kamal Nath spoke about ways to ensure malls do not maul livelihoods.

 ?We are still working on our formulation for retail. We have allowed Metro to come to our state in the wholesale sector because it will bring with it cold chain facilities and modern handling techniques. We said no to Wal-Mart, whose plans would lead to a situation where too many people making their living from retail would have been left jobless,? Bhattacharjee pointed out.

 The Union commerce minister also said the efforts of the Centre were directed towards creating jobs, not reducing them. ?We need investments in the back-end of the retail chain. We are working on how to do this without dislodging employment,? Nath told the Ficci conclave.

 The Left had crossed swords with the Centre earlier over plans to allow up to 100 per cent FDI in retail as the parties felt it was a recipe for millions of job losses in the neighbourhood pop-and-mom stores across the country. 

 The compromise that appears to have been hammered out would throw up a plan for ?limited opening up? of the retail sector. Officials say one alternative being toyed with is to liberalise food retailing in a small way; the other would be to allow foreign investors to set up high-end stores in select cities.

 Bhattacharya conceded investment was needed but insisted ?we need to take a balanced view of it.? The commerce minister, seated along side, nodded in agreement. 

 Nath should know. After all, Calcutta is fast emerging as the country?s retail capital, second only to Mumbai in fresh investments flowing into swanky malls. 

 Pantaloons, which has two stores already, is planning its third. Westside, Shopper?s Stop, Big Bazaar, Landmark, Emami and Acer are the other big names waiting to take the retail plunge in the Left citadel.

 Officials say with 7 per cent of the countrys consumer purchases coming from Calcutta and a handful of other towns in the eastern state, Bengal has come a long way to become a darling of domestic retail giants. 

 Last month, there were signs that the government would allow FDI in the retail food sector. The Left parties would be consulted on allowing global food chains to set up shops here in partnership with Indian brands. 

 The proposal was to help the domestic food-processing parks sell their brands in the overseas market, piggy-backing on transnational food chains. The price: global retail food chains would have to be given entry to the upper strata of the Indian metro market. 

 The government wants to take advantage of the new WTO regime. With tariff rates and subsidy levels going down in the developed world, Indian processed foods have a comparative advantage in global trade.

 Low-priced handsets from Sony Ericsson

 Big plans

 Tokyo, June 14 (Bloomberg): Sony Ericsson Mobile Communications, the mobile-phone venture owned by Sony Corp and Ericsson AB, will introduce more models, including cheaper, entry-level phones for markets in India and China.

 Were going to increase the number of products this year compared with last year, and aim for the same trend for next year, Jan Wareby, executive vice-president of Sony Ericsson said. 

 Were introducing entry-level phones which are important for markets like India.

 Sony Ericsson, which unveiled four new phones, including the entry level J210i model, needs to tap into Asias fastest-growing markets as competitors such as Motorola Inc and Nokia may also come up with cheaper models. 

 To maintain earnings growth, the company is offering higher-end phones, such as the walkman-branded models that double up as digital music players.

 Prices in the first quarter fell because of the higher proportion of entry-level phones, Wareby said. We have other phones coming, so we see the average selling price staying about where it is. 

 Sony Ericssons net income fell 61 per cent in the first quarter as it suffered from price cuts triggered by Nokia. Market share is important, and our goal is to improve volume share, said Wareby. 

 Our aim is to be one of the big ones in a few years.

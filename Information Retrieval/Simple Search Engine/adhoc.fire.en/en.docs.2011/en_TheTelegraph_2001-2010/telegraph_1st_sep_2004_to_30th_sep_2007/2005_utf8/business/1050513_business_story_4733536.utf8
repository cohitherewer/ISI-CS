The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 New twist to Birla will case

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 12: A division bench of Calcutta High Court today stayed an earlier order of a trial court, which ruled that three members of the countrys first business family did not have any interest in the case in connection with the last testament of Priyamvada Birla. 

 Admitting an appeal moved by three members of the Birla family, Basant Kumar, Krishna Kumar and Yashovardhan, a division bench of Justices Pinaki Chandra Ghose and P. N. Sinha passed an interim stay of 10 weeks on the earlier order passed by Justice Kalyanjyoti Sengupta. 

 The division bench also admitted another appeal filed by the Birlas challenging the order in which the trial court accepted Lodhas caveat in connection with the 1982 will of the late M. P. Birla.

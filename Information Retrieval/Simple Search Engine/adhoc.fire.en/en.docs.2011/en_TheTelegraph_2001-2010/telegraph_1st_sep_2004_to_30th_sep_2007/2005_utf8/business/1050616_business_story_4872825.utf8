 BSNL mulls fixed-line prepaid service

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 15: As part of its renewed focus on growing the fixed-line user base, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) plans to introduce prepaid facility for landlines.

 Speaking at the inauguration of the first telephone exchange at New Town, Rajarhat, S. P. Chakravarty, chief general manager of Calcutta Telephones, said, We will introduce the fixed-line prepaid (FLPP) service within the next three to four months. The demand for the IT card (India Telephone Card) has prompted us to look at prepaid as an option for fixed-line users. The tariff and the denomination of the cards are being worked on.

 BSNL will also set up two units to handle the extra traffic on the intelligent network (IN), which handles the IT card traffic in Calcutta and Ahmedabad.

 CalTel has identified 48 locations in the city to set up hotspots with the combination of Wi-Fi (wireless fidelity) and WiMax (worldwide interoperability for microwave access).

 Both Wi-Fi and WiMax are wireless technologies that provide connectivity at speeds up to 75 MBPS as against the current benchmark of 256 KBPS in India. 

 As part of its national broadband rollout project, estimated to cost Rs 260 crore, BSNL plans to set up hotspots across the country to allow users access broadband services in places like airports, railway stations, hotels and convention centres. 

 The telecom major has already identified 15 cities where it will set up 300 Wi-Fi hotspots in a phased manner. These locations will be chosen depending on customer usage profile in each city. 

 BSNL has chosen Calcutta, Chennai, Bangalore and satellite towns of Mumbai and Delhi for the first phase of the rollout.

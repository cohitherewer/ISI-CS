 Taj snaps up hotel in Sydney 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 14: The Indian Hotels Company Ltd today said that it has acquired W Hotel in Australia for a consideration of Australian $ 36 million reflecting the groups aim of turning into a global hotel chain. 

 Indian Hotels, better known as Taj Hotels REsorts and Palaces, had earlier taken over the Pierre Hotel in New York. After the United States and Australia, the company is now planning to open shop in other countries, too, such as China, Bhutan and Dubai.

 The Australian property is a 100-room five-year-old hotel, located in close proximity to the central business district of Woolloomooloo Bay in Sydney. The hotel is currently run by the Starwood Group and is among the top five hotels in Sydney. It is a boutique hotel in the heart of a luxury marina, entertainment and apartment complex.

 According to Indian Hotels, the re-branding and management of W Hotel will begin in February next year. The hotel would then be operated under one of its own brands, the company added. 

 In July this year, the Taj group had taken over the Pierre Hotel in New York. 

 The foray into Australia is being seen as part of its plan to be present in key gateway cities.

 Commenting on the acquisition, Raymond Bickson, managing director and CEO, Indian Hotels Company Ltd, said, We are delighted to make our debut in Australia with this wonderful hotel located in the up-market business district of Sydney. 

 The property is located within the walking distance of the central business and shopping districts, the Sydney Opera House and is adjacent to the Royal Botanical Gardens, offering spectacular surround views. 

 A Conde Nast Traveler 2005 Gold List award winner, W Hotel is a blend of a boutique hotel with the facilities and reliability of a top-end business hotel. The hotel offers rooms with stylish interiors, popular restaurants, state-of-the-art fitness facilities, spa services and a full-service business centre. 

 Speaking to reporters here today, Anil Goel, vice-president, Indian Hotels, revealed that the hotel had annual revenues of Australian $13 million and the deal would be financed partly by a foreign currency convertible bond issue which the company had raised last year. The Indian chain, however, is not planning to rest with the foray Down Under. 

 The firm, which operates 73 hotels at home and abroad, is set to open new properties in Dubai and Bhutan. An entry into China is also on the cards.

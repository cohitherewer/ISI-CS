 Calcutta, May 8: TM International Logistics Ltd plans to develop a minor port in the west coast. The Tata Steel subsidiary, which operates a berth at the Haldia Port apart from carrying out freight forwarding and customs clearance, is considering Gujarat and Maharashtra as the possible locations for the port.

 The minor port will handle bulk and break bulk cargo. Managing director S. C. Saxena said the company was waiting for an opportunity to develop the port facility.

 The company, a 51:49 joint venture between Tata Steel and German logistic company IQ Martrade Holding, is mostly engaged in Tata Steel cargo like limestone and steel in the ports of Haldia, Paradip and Vishakhapatnam. 

 The share of non-Tata Steel cargo at present is only 20 per cent but the company plans to double the share in the next three years.

 Apart from developing a port, TM International is also firming up plans to buy at least two ships this year itself. It is considering buying a handymax and a panamax vessel having dead weight tonne (DWT) of 60,000 tonnes and 50,000 tonnes, respectively.

 Given the tight situation of the ship building industry globally, it is going to buy five-year old second-hand ships. The panamax may cost in the region of $25 million, while handymax will come at $15-20 million. At present, the company does not own any ship. 

 In order to develop new jetties like that of Haldia, own vessels and install cargo-handling equipment like shore crane, TM International has lined up investments of Rs 250 crore.

 ?We are exploring various options, including an IPO, to arrange the fund. But money will not be a constraint for us,? Saxena added.

 However, if the port opportunity materialises, the investment can shoot up.

 TM International will also bid for operations and management contract for the proposed Dhamra port, which is being developed in Orissa by Tata Steel and Larsen amp; Toubro. 

 The project is linked to Tata Steel?s proposed steel plant in that state.

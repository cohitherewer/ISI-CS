 Mittal: Bidding blues

 New Delhi, May 17: Sunil Bharti Mittal today expressed strong misgivings about the bidding procedures framed by the government for the privatisation of Delhi and Mumbai airports.

 Mittal, chief of the Bharti group, said he was worried with the governments first past the post system where the highest bidder would win the right to become the strategic partner for the revamp. The group is one of almost a dozen combines that are preparing to bid for the airport privatisation.

 Mittal raised the issue with finance minister P. Chidambaram at the CII national conference that opened here today.

 Chidambaram said he wasnt aware of the bid conditions but was pretty confident that there would be non-monetary criteria as well for the selection of the private partner. We will look into the matter, the finance minister added.

 The Bharti group has been keen to bid for the Delhi airport revamp and the manner in which he raised the issue seemed to indicate that he was afraid of losing out in a tense bidding war.

 In one sense, Bhartis concern appeared to mark a throwback to the way the telecom licences were auctioned in the early nineties. These saw huge bids made by a few companies which won the licences and then resold them to others. The high bids had forced telecom players to later plead for the switchover to a revenue-sharing regime which the government permitted in 1999.

 Mittal was, however, quick to assert that he was not trying to draw any parallels between the airport revamp bids and the earlier telecom licence bids.

 We want the government to set strict standards for the private partner in all new infrastructure projects ? whether it is telecom, airport or ports. The government should examine the ability of the bidder to build world-class infrastructure facilities rather than focus on the bidders contribution to the exchequer, Mittal said on the sidelines of the conclave.

 Mittal was reported to have said that he would not participate in the bid for airport privatisation if Bharti failed to bag the Delhi contract.

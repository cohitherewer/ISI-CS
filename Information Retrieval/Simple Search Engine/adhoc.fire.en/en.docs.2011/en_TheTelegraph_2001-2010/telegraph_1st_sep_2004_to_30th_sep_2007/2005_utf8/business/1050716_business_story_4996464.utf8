 Calcutta, July 15: India will benefit under the European Unions new Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) scheme for trade with developing countries, which is slated for implementation from January 1 next year. 

 The new GSP scheme, which grants additional trade preferences to developing countries in terms of market access in EU member countries, extends duty free exports (from developing countries to EU markets) to 7,200 products in addition to continuing the benefits on textiles and agro-based products. 

 Speaking at a seminar organised by Bharat Chamber of Commerce, Mariella Cantagalli, first secretary, Trade and Economic section, Delegation of the European Commission in India, said, India has displaced China as a major beneficiary of the GPS scheme. We are looking at financial services, outsourcing in IT, healthcare, entertainment, retail, textiles, pharmaceuticals and agro-processing industries where trade relations between India and EU could be developed, 

 Indo-EU trade registered a 150 per cent growth during the last ten years. In 2003-04, Indias exports to EU grew 21.1 per cent while imports increased 17.3 per cent.

 However, India accounts for a mere 1.3 per cent of EUs total trade compared with Chinas share of 7.5 per cent. 

 A Trade and Investment Development Programme has already been launched with a view to simplify administrative and regulatory regimes and building capacities at the government as well as private sectors. 

 A joint action group will lead the initiative and will be unveiled in September this year.

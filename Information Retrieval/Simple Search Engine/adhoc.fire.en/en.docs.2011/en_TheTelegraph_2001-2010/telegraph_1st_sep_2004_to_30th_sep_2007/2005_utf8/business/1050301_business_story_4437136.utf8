 Boot-up command for PCs, cells to ring louder

 M RAJENDRAN

 New Delhi, Feb. 28: Computer prices will come down by Rs 300-600 and the demand for mobile telephones could surge.

 The telecom and infotech industries have reason to feel chuffed: Chidambaram has offered them a slew of tax incentives and scrapped the requirement to mandatory filing of income tax returns if one owned a mobile phone.

 The benefits are designed to create a level-playing field for the domestic industry, which will face competition as a result of the move to bring down the customs duty to nil on 217 items as part of the Information Technology Agreement (ITA).

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram said, ?The electronics and telecom sectors merit special attention. I propose to remove the customs duty on specified capital goods and all inputs required for the manufacture of the ITA-bound items.?

 Clear call

However, Chidambaram has imposed a countervailing duty (CVD) of 4 per cent on all imports to compensate for the state-level taxes in view of the value added tax to be imposed by the state governments on corresponding domestic goods from April 1. Credit for CVD will be available against payment of excise duty. 

 Chidambaram said, ?However, because we have a soft corner for these wares, IT software will be exempt from the proposed CVD.?

 N. K. Goyal, president of the Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association, said, ?We hope the government will ensure that the parity on imposition of VAT on domestic manufacturing implemented vis-?-vis imports.?

 Sameer Kochhar, CEO of Skoch Consultancy Services, said, ?We are looking at a price reduction of 3-6 per cent on computers. This is because of the combined effect of customs duty coming down to zero and the CVD down by 4 per cent.?

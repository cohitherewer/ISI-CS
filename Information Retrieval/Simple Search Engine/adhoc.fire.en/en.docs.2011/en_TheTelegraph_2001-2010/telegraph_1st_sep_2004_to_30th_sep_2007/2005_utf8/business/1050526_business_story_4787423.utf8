 June-end deadline for rival Allied bid 

 Quite a constellation

 London, May 25 (Reuters): Britains Takeover Panel has set a June 29 deadline for a consortium headed by Constellation Brands to make a rival offer for UK spirits group Allied Domecq, which has already agreed to be taken over by Frances Pernod Ricard. 

 The panel issued the put up or shut up ruling to the Constellation camp as Allied issued the offer document for its takeover by Pernod on Wednesday and its scheme of arrangement, aimed at speeding up the Allied-Pernod deal. The panel said Constellation must decide whether to issue a firm intention to bid by 5 pm (1600 GMT) on June 29 or to say it will not proceed with a bid and then not make an approach for Allied for six months. 

 We have enough time to put together a viable bid, said one source close to the Constellation consortium, while sources at Allied said it was co-operating with the Constellation camp to give them the details to help them put together an offer. 

 Allied confirmed it will hold a shareholders meeting on July 4 to approve its agreed ?7.5 billion ($13.7 billion) takeover by Pernod unless a counter bid emerges. 

 Pernod said in its document prepared for shareholders that its takeover of Allied should be completed on July 26 if it got all the necessary approvals and was not derailed by a counter bid. It also said it had got the green light for the deal from the Frances AMF market watchdog on May 23. 

 Last month, Allied agreed to be bought by Chivas Regal whisky and Martell cognac group Pernod and its US partner Fortune Brands, which makes Jim Beam bourbon, for 545 pence a share in cash and 0.0158 new Pernod shares for each Allied share. 

 The two groups would split up Allieds brands with Pernod taking the majority such as Ballantines whisky, Beefeater gin and Kahlua liqueur, while Fortune would get Sauza tequila and Makers Mark bourbon. 

 This sparked interest in Allied as the last big buying opportunity in an industry where many players are controlled by family interests. The worlds biggest wine group, Constellation Brands, is leading a consortium, which has made a bid proposal but has not yet made a formal offer for Allied. 

 Constellation is leading a team that includes Jack Daniels maker Brown-Forman and financial firms Lion Capital and Blackstone Group. Constellation is considering a bid likely to be around 700p per Allied share in cash.

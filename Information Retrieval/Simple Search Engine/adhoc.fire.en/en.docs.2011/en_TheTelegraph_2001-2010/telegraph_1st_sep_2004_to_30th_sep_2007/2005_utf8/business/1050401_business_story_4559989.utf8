 GM gets a new driver for China

 Wale: New challenge

 Shanghai, March 31 (Reuters): General Motors Corp, the world?s biggest auto maker, will send its top UK executive to take charge in China after the ex-chief?s surprise resignation raised questions about business in GM?s second-largest market.

 GM said on Thursday that European vice-president and chairman of UK operations Kevin Wale will replace Phil Murtaugh ? a nine-year China veteran who joined GM in 1973 and was instrumental in forging a venture with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp, the country?s largest car maker. Wale joins at a difficult time for GM, which lags Volkswagen AG in China, the world?s third-largest vehicle market, which has been convulsed by slowing sales, price wars and ballooning unsold inventories.

 Analysts say Murtaugh?s departure might also deprive GM of some of its laboriously cultivated contacts among its domestic partners and with the government of China?s commercial hub. GM appeared to be addressing those concerns.

 Australian-born Wale, also chairman of GM?s Vauxhall Motor Co, once headed the firm?s Asia Pacific operations.

 ?His familiarity with China and Asia-Pacific comes from playing a key role in the development of our product and growth strategies, which laid the groundwork for our current presence,? Troy Clarke, GM?s Asia-Pacific president, said in a statement.

 Murtaugh will remain in the job for a short period to ease the transition, GM said, stressing that his departure had nothing to do with the firm?s performance in China.

 ?He left for personal reasons and GM would love to keep him,? GM China spokeswoman Daphne Zheng said.

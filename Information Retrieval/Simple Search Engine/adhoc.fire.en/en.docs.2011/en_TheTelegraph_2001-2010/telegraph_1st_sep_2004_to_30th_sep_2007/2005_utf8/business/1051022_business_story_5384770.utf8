 Sony eager to tap local talent pool

 Mumbai, Oct. 21 (Reuters): Sony plans to tap Indias skills to develop more software for products and use its popular content to expand its market share here, its chief executive Howard Stringer said.

 Sony Corp, which said last month it would cut about 7 per cent of its global work force, has a software centre in Bangalore that develops technologies for home networks, digital media platforms and Internet-enabled consumer electronic devices.

 Were in a ghastly phase of reconstruction ... we are closing plants and laying off people, Stringer said. We have to find a way to get our arms around software development, but give us some time to think about what we want to do in India.

 Sony lags its nimbler Korean rivals, Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics, and Chinese new entrant Haier, which are all investing heavily in manufacturing and research and development facilities in India.

 Sony Ericsson, the worlds fifth-largest mobile phone maker jointly owned with Swedens Ericsson, said earlier this year it was looking at setting up a facility to make phones in India ? the fastest-growing mobile market.

 Sony also operates Indias number two cable network, Sony Entertainment Television, which broadcasts three channels of entertainment in Hindi, besides cricket.

 Our content here has been so successful, perhaps more than anywhere else in the world outside the US, Stringer said. I hope our content here will also drive sales of our hardware.

 But we dont like being number two and chasing Murdoch, Stringer said, referring to STAR, the leading network in India which is owned by Rupert Murdochs News Corp.

 Film studio and distributor Sony Pictures on Thursday signed a co-production deal with director Sanjay Leela Bhansali for his film Saawariya (Beloved). 

 Indias entertainment industry revenue is expected to more than double to Rs 295 billion by 2009, according to estimates by PriceWaterhouseCoopers.

 Calcutta, May 8: The Darjeeling tea logo ? a lady with two leaves and a bud with the word Darjeeling written on one side ? is ready for a makeover.

 Ogilvy amp; Mather executive chairman Piyush Pandey has been assigned the task of redesigning the famous logo and planning a campaign to establish Darjeeling tea as a global brand.

 The industry has decided to reposition Darjeeling tea in the global as well as domestic market. To start with, the Darjeeling Planters Association has changed its name to Darjeeling Tea Association.

 Association chairman Sanjay P. Bansal said, ?With the introduction of the Geographical Indication Act for Darjeeling we thought it prudent to change the name to Darjeeling Tea Association. The earlier name ? Darjeeling Planters Association ? did not only mean tea. It meant an association of any type of planters.?

 Bansal added that the logo as well as the campaign will be ready within six to eight weeks.

 The name was changed with immediate effect at a special general meeting of the Darjeeling Planters Association on May 2. The name has been changed after 113 years to keep up with the changing scenario, Bansal added.

 The first annual general meeting of the Darjeeling planters was held in 1873 to consult problems of the Darjeeling tea estates. Later in 1892, the Darjeeling Planters Association was formed. The association was affiliated to the Indian Tea Association in 1910. 

 On December 1, 1951, the Darjeeling Planters Association in their last extraordinary meeting unanimously decided to dissolve the association and transfer all its assets and liabilities to the newly formed Darjeeling Branch of the Indian Tea Association (DBITA).

 Over the years, the owners of the Darjeeling tea estates decided unanimously to form a sole independent association to address their special problems and develop, promote and protect Darjeeling tea.

 On December 20, 1983, the present Darjeeling Planters Association was formed under the chairmanship of S. K. Bhasin, dissolving DBITA. The association is one of the constituent members of the Consultative Committee of Plantation Associations.

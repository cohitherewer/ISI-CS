 Finance corporation in debt rejig

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 18: West Bengal Financial Corporation (WBFC) has started a debt restructuring exercise.

 It will allow us to lower our cost of borrowing. We are in talks with various banks to allow us to prepay our high-interest loans, Trinath Krishna Sinha, managing director of the state financial corporation, said. 

 The corporation had issued SLR bonds worth Rs 178 crore and non-SLR bonds of Rs 50 crore.

 The corporation has already prepaid loans worth Rs 27 crore to State Bank of India and Rs 13 crore to Bank of Baroda. 

 It is currently prepaying Rs 30-crore loan to United Bank of India and Rs 13 crore to State Co-operative Bank. 

 We have approached Uco Bank to accept a loan prepayment of Rs 8 crore and also Allahabad Bank, said Sinha on the sidelines of an interactive session organised by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BNCCI).

 He said these loans were taken against issue of SLR bonds at an average interest of 14 per cent. 

 However, since the average cost of lending was 16-17 per cent, it was feasible for us. But, in the low interest rate regime we are lending at 11 per cent and servicing such high-interest loans becomes economically infeasible, he added.

 Such prepayment also depends on our ability to generate funds. We have already made two non-SLR bond issues of Rs 23 crore and Rs 27 crore. We have also approached Sidbi for a bridge loan of Rs 30 crore, said Sinha.

 During the last financial year, the West Bengal Financial Corporation has sanctioned loans worth Rs 181.48 crore against a target of Rs 180 crore, while disbursed Rs 110.98 crore. 

 For the current fiscal, we have set a sanction target of Rs 190 crore and a disbursal target of Rs 160 crore, said Sinha. 

 The corporation also aims at recovering Rs 170 crore in the current fiscal. Rs 158 crore was recovered last fiscal.

 The loans were sanctioned to 458 units last financial year. The amount disbursed to 404 small-scale units was Rs 45.38 crore.

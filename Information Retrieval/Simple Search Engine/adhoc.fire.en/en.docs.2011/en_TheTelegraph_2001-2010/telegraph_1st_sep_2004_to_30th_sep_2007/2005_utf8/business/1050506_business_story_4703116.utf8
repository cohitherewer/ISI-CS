 Upscale living in the city of joy has entered a new phase with Palacio ? the newest deluxe apartment building at Queens Park in south Calcutta. 

 Spread over half an acre, Palacio, a signature project from the Belani group, will house 15 units.

 The unique selling proposition of the project is its location. Queens Park is home to Calcuttas rich and famous. Absence of any fresh housing stock with huge demand from people looking for the prized address makes the property so lucrative. 

 In keeping with stature of the project, owners will be provided the opportunity to customise his/her unit. It has been often noticed that people make changes after they move in.

 ?At Palacio, owners will have the freedom to instal their own sanitary fittings and tiles and change the interiors of the flats according to taste, provided they do not interfere with the basic concept of the apartments,? Nandu Belani of the Belani group said. 

 Palacio will boast of the latest security gadgets like video door phones. Given the spate of murders in highrises of late, this system will come in handy for residents.

 Even though the project is coming up in the heart of the city, Palacio will have a fair share of green in the forms of shady groves, lawns and landscaped open spaces.

 Designed by Dulal Mukherjee, the apartments follow the principles of Vaastu Shastra. All flats are south facing with three sides open.

 Each flat will be provided with separate servants quarters. Owners will have access to a private gymnasium and a community hall. ?These facilities will come as add-ons at no extra cost,? Belani added.

 STATUS: To be ready in next 2 years. But only five flats left unsold.

 APPROXIMATE PRICE: Rs 1-1.5 crore

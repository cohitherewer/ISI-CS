 A-I decision on Boeing models next month

 Mumbai, Oct. 15 (PTI): Indias flagship carrier Air-India would specify various models and their respective break-ups with Boeing Company next month for acquisition of 68 aircraft, chairman V. Thulasidas said today.

 The order consists of 50 new long-range, wide-bodied, state-of-the-art aircraft for Air-India and eighteen B737-800w planes for Air-India Charters Ltd, Thulasidas told reporters on the sidelines of the 101st birth anniversary celebrations of J.R.D. Tata, the father of Indian civil aviation. 

 The total cost of these aircraft and related infrastructure was estimated at about Rs 35,000 crore prior to negotiations with the manufacturers of airframe and engines. The ultimate project cost will be firmed up after completion of negotiations with the airframe/engine manufacturers.

 Air-India will have to pay a pre-delivery commitment of 15 per cent of the total cost. To meet this, financing arrangements will be made, Thulasidas added. 

 A letter of intent will be signed with the Seattle-based Boeing and the engine manufacturers followed by signing of purchase agreements once the government approval is received, he clarified.

 This will be the single largest order by Air-India after the airline commenced operations in 1953 under the Air Corporations Act.

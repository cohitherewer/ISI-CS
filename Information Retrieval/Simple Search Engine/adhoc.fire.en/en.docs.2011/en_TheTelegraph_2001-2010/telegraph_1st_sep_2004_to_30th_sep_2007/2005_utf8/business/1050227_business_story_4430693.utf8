 Chug along to the land of opportunity

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 26: Forget the trains, it is the land belonging to the great Indian railways where all the action is.

 The railway minister has announced several public-private partnership initiatives to garner resources through non-traditional methods.

 The biggest initiative is to unlock the value of land that has been lying vacant for years. The railways plans to commercially exploit the surplus land.

 Through public private partnership, the Railway Land Development Authority (RLDA) will develop surplus land adjoining railway stations and goods sheds for constructing warehousing and logistics parks. RLDA would also generate additional resources for the development of the railways. 

 In the coming years, RLDA will also develop metro stations into world class modern stations and extend passenger amenities through construction of food plazas and shopping malls on vacant land. In the last Parliament session, the Railway (amendment) Bill 2004 was passed, which sought the setting up of the RLDA. 

 The railway minister said that in 2005-06, an all-out effort will be made to convert the new Delhi railway station into a modern world class station. 

 Apart from the development of land and even the airspace available to the railways, there will be other private-public partnership schemes to garner funds. These include private sidings, parcel initiatives, using optic fibre cable network of RailTel and Wagon investments. 

 A scheme for development of integrated warehouse complex by the private sector has also been approved with a view to encourage public private partnership. 

 Seeking to leverage the vast optic fibre network of RailTel, the minister has announced that the network will be exploited through joint ventures, either through leasing or channel partner. It will also provide broadband services like internet, voice telephony on internet, cable TV, national long distance telephony in urban as well as rural areas.

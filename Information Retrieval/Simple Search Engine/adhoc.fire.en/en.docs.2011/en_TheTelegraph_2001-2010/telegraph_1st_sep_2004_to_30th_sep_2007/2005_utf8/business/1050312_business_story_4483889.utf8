 Bharti chief sells personal holding

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mittal: Acting fast

 New Delhi, March 11: Sunil Bharti Mittal ? the telecom tycoon ? has sold his entire personal holding in Bharti Tele-ventures for an undisclosed amount.

 Mittal?s personal holding is 27.5 lakh shares ? just about 0.15 per cent of the total equity. However, he will continue to hold 46.5 per cent as a promoter of Bharti Enterprises in the only privately-listed telecom stock on the bourses.

 After the sale, Mittal will not hold any shares in Bharti Tele-Ventures in his personal capacity as a director.

 Taking advantage of the recent bull run in recent months, a few company promoters, directors and executives have sold shares amounting to more than Rs 1,117 crore, according to information provided to the two stock exchanges ? BSE and NSE. 

 On the BSE today, the Bharti scrip opened at Rs 225.15, rose to the day?s high of Rs 229.90 and touched a low of Rs 221, before closing at Rs 225.45 against Thursday?s close of Rs 223.15.

 Mittal sold his 27.5 lakh shares in the open market. According to a senior company executive, ?He can sell his shares in his personal capacity as a director of BTVL. This is a very insignificant 0.15 per cent of the total shares of BTVL.? 

 Mittal was not available for comment on the stake sale.

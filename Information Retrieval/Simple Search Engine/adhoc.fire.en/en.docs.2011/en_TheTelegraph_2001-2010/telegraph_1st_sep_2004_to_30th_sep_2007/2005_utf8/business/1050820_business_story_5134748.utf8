 WHO booster dose for drug duo

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 19: The World Health Organisation (WHO) has included drugs of Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd and Aurobindo Pharma Ltd in its pre-qualification list for developing countries.

 While seven anti-retrovirals (ARVs) of Ranbaxy have made it to the list, three drugs by APL have also been approved. Of the seven ARVs, three were dropped by WHO earlier. The organisation found the safety and efficacy tests on the drugs satisfactory.

 Ranbaxy feels that the development will make it easier for developing countries to access affordable generic ARVs.

 Ranbaxy CEO and managing director Brian Tempest said the inclusion of the companys drugs in the WHO list is a major step towards the companys endeavour to make high quality, cost-effective ARVs available to HIV patients around the world.

 Since 2001, Ranbaxy has been providing ARV medicines at affordable prices to AIDS/HIV affected countries for patients who might not otherwise be able to gain access to this therapy. 

 The Ranbaxy share gained Rs 11.90 to close at Rs 534 on the BSE today.

 Brokers said speculation of a possible settlement with Pfizer over Ranbaxys challenge of the patent for the $10-billion Lipitor drug also contributed to the rise.

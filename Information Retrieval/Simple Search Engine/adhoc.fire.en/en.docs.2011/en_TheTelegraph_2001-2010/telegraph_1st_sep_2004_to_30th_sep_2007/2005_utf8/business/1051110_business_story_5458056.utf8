 Demat trade gets a boost

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 9: The demat dollops have just been sweetened. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) today asked depositories not to charge investors for transferring shares from one depository participant to another.

 Starting January 9, no fee will be imposed by a depository on a participant, which, in turn, will waive all charges when it transfers securities in an account to another branch of the same depository participant or a new depository.

 This decision of the market regulator would make the demat arrangement free, barring a couple of statutory charges. The move is expected to encourage more investors to keep their securities in the paperless form.

 In its clarification issued along with the order, Sebi said the charges would be scrapped only if the owner of the stocks at the two ends of depository participant is the same.

 In case of a joint account, the depository where shares are being shifted must also be held by more than one individual. The sequence of ownership must be the same , the market regulator stated in its release issued today.

 It is observed that Depositories and Depository Participants have been levying transaction charges for the transfer of securities from one DP to another DP, although no account-closure fee is charged. This implies that an investor not satisfied with the services of a DP can shift his account, only at a cost. It is desirable that investors are freed of this cost, Sebi said. 

 Depositories have also been advised to put in place before January 8 systems that differentiate between an account-closure transaction and a normal debit entry. This will ensure smooth implementation of the decision. 

 Early this year, the market regulator decided that no investor would pay any charge for opening of a depository account, except the statutory ones. They would also be free from paying a fee for credit of securities into an account. Custody charges were also junked.

 JC Flowers in Refco race

 New York, Oct. 17 (Reuters): An investor group led by private equity firm JC Flowers amp; Co. was bidding against hedge fund firm Man Group Plc and others to buy troubled Refco Incs core futures business, as Refcos advisers met to devise a rescue plan, a source close to the matter said.

 Refcos advisers are hoping to salvage the companys futures brokerage while mulling bankruptcy protection for its broker-dealer and prime broker divisions that shut down this week, the source said.

 Refcos stock plunged by more than 70 per cent last week and customers fled after the company put chief executive Phillip Bennett on leave because a firm he controlled was allegedly involved in shuffling about $430 million in debt on and off Refcos books.

 The consortium led by JC Flowers ? an investment fund led by former Goldman Sachs banker Christopher Flowers ? has emerged as the front runner, the source said. Its competing against Man Groups brokerage unit, Man Financial, and others, the source added.

 Refcos advisers include Goldman Sachs, Scott Schoen of buy-out firm Thomas H. Lee Partners, which owns 38 per cent of Refcos shares; and a team formed by Arthur Levitt, former US Securities and Exchange Commission chairman.

 Refco has also brought in investment bank Greenhill amp; Co. for additional advice. Greenhills presence may squash talk of potential conflicts of interest for Goldman, which was one of three underwriters for Refcos IPO two months ago.

 Saving Refcos main futures and commodities trading operation is the focus of current efforts. The parent company, which has 2,400 employees and operates in 14 countries, also has a broker-dealer and a prime brokerage unit, both of which were shut down last week.

 US prosecutors charged Bennett with securities fraud on Wednesday for hiding the bad debts in the form of a receivable to inflate the companys financial standing as it went public.

 Refco raised $583 million in the August IPO with Bennett owning 34 per cent of the company. Private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners LLC acquired a majority stake in Refco in June 2004 and still owns 38 per cent of the company.

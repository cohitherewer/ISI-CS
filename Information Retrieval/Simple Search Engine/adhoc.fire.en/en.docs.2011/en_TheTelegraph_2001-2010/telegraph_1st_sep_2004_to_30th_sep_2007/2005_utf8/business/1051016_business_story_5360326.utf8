 ABN AMRO rejig signals shift in focus 

 Change in the air

 Amsterdam, Oct. 15 (Reuters): Dutch bank ABN AMRO detailed a restructuring on Friday to focus on its mid-market corporate clients and said its chief operating officer would take over as finance chief from January 1.

 Its three main business units ? consumer and commercial clients, private and wholesale clients and asset management ? will be replaced by 10 units from next year, giving clients access to a broader product range.

 The Netherlands largest bank had said in February it planned such a move and had begun last year a process of focusing on fewer corporate relationships.

 This is the next step in aligning our organisation further with our strategy, enabling us to serve our clients even better by drawing on the untapped potential of the group, ABN AMRO chairman Rijkman Groenink said in a statement.

 The bank sealed a major IT outsourcing deal last month and has cut 10,000 jobs in four years to cope with stagnant markets.

 ABN said on Friday that measures undertaken since December last to increase efficiency across the group through consolidation and standardisation were on track to yield annual savings of at least 600 million euros ($719 million) from 2007.

 On balance we believe that the new organisation structure, although complex at first sight, gives a better reflection of the companys prime focus, said analyst Paul van Doorn at brokerage Kempen amp; Co.

 Over time this will improve the companys strategic profile and more importantly lead to better returns on the existing client base, he added.

 Five of the new units will incorporate clients from the former consumer and commercial segment in Brazil, North America and the Netherlands as well as commercial clients from the wholesale clients business unit.

 There will also be two global client business units, one of which will serve the banks 550 multinational corporate clients.

 Three business units will focus on the mid-market segment ? clients who need more than just a bank account.

 To help gain affluent and mid-market clients, ABN also sealed a bid for Italys Banca Antonveneta last month, winning a majority stake valuing Antonveneta at 8.2 billion euros.

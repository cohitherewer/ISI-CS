 Birla: Tackling losses

 Calcutta, June 21: Mysore Cement is planning an equity issue to stall mounting losses.

 The board of the S. K. Birla-owned company will meet tomorrow to discuss the possible equity offering.

 ?There is a proposal to raise Rs 10-15 crore to prevent losses,? chairman S. K. Birla told The Telegraph.

 The funds will be used to meet the working capital requirements, he added.

 The Bangalore-based company, which diversified into sponge iron making, had suffered a net loss of Rs 36.09 crore on a net sales of Rs 332.8 crore in 2003-04. 

 During the first nine months of 2004-05, the company has suffered a loss of Rs 24.46 crore.

 The fresh capital infusion is expected to ease the working capital situation and the pressure on the company.

 Of late, Mysore Cement has expanded its capacity from 1.5 million tonnes to 2.2 million tonnes. 

 ?Expansion of the capacity is not an issue. We need to check the losses,? he said, adding that the final decision on the follow-on or a rights issue would be taken by the board.

 Asked if he was hopeful that the fresh infusion would help the company turn around, Birla said the board should first vet the proposal.

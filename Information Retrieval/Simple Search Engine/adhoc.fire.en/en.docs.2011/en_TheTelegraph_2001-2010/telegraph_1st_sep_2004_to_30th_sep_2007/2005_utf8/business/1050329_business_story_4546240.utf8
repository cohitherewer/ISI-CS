 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Chennai, March 28: Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions today announced a Rs 115-crore investment plan for setting up a training academy and two software development blocks, which can accommodate 3,500 employees.

 ?Cognizant is committed to investing $25.4 million (about Rs 115 crore) for expanding its operations in Chennai,? said president and CEO Lakshmi Narayanan.

 Cognizant was also ?evaluating? the setting up of a development centre in Coimbatore that could employ 400 people during the first year of operations, said Narayanan.

 The IT services company, which employs its biggest workforce in Chennai at 7,300 people, was committed to construct a fully-owned techno-complex in Siruseri, on the outskirts of the city. ?This will be ready for occupancy in a phased manner, starting December,? he said.

 The first phase of the new facility will have a development centre spread over 2,00,000 sq ft of built-up space and will accommodate about 2,000 professionals.

 In addition to this facility, Cognizant has signed up 6 acres of plot adjacent to its existing techno-complex in Thoraipakkom in Chennai for constructing another software development park.

 ?This block will have a built-up space of 1,50,000 sq ft and will accommodate approximately 1,500 people when completed in December,? he said.

 Narayanan said Cognizant was also constructing a dedicated training facility, Cognizant Academy, at its Siruseri facility. The facility will have 75 classrooms in a space of 1,00,000 sq ft to train about 1,800 professionals simultaneously, Narayanan said.

 The IT services major would hire 6,500 people in the next nine months and announced that its Chinese centre would start operations in April.

 Narayanan said the company planned to add 7,200 employees in 2005, of which 85 per cent would be employed at its software development centres in India.

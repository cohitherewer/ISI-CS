 Muthuraman: Big plans

 Jamshedpur, Sept. 9: Tata Steel will invest Rs 1,00,000 crore over the next 12-15 years in an expansion that will raise its capacity to over 33 million tonnes (mt) from 7 mt now. 

 Managing director B. Muthuraman said the capacity would be 22 mt in Jharkhand, while new units in Orissa (5 mt) and Chattisgarh (6 mt) would account for the rest. Funding will not be a problem since the expansion will be spread over 15 years. 

 The countrys largest private-sector steel maker could acquire a 2-mt plant in a South-East Asian country in four to five months. Due diligence on the firm is under way, Muthuraman said. 

 Tata Steel produces 5 mt at its Jamshedpur plant and 2 mt at the Singapore-based NatSteel it acquired last year. The company expects a demand growth of 3 to 4 per cent over 25 years for the increased output to be sold.

 Steel prices will remain buoyant, at least higher than the last decade, for some time now, Muthuraman added. The first of the new greenfield ventures is expected to be completed within the next four-and-half years.

 However, the plans hinge on iron ore leases from state governments. The company has already sought approval for 600,000 million tonnes of iron ore for the next 30 years. Another 4,00,000 million tonnes will be needed over 20 years after that for its 12-mt plant in Jharkhand. 

 To expand the capacity of the Jamshedpur unit to 10 mt from 5 mt, another 400,000 mt of iron ore will be required. The company expects the Jharkhand government to make the allocation in the next one year. 

 Jharkhand, Chattisgarh and Orissa have the bulk of iron-ore deposits in the country and steel-makers, including global giants like Mittal Steel and Posco, are vying for them. 

 Muthuraman said the joint venture agreement with Bluescope Steel of Australia was on track and the company would be formed in three months. Tata Steel will invest Rs 1,500 crore in this venture, which will set up its first unit in Jamshedpur and another at Dhuburi in Orissa. It will make colour-coated steel used in construction, he said. 

 Muthuraman said the work would start by December on the companys South African ferro-chrome project, which has been delayed by a year due to a change in site.

 Process studies for the titanium project in Tamil Nadu have been completed and the 25,000 acres needed for the unit is being acquired. The first phase will cost Rs 400 crore.

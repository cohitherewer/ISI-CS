 Buyout boost to Essar Steel 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 8: Essar Steel has acquired UK-based Stemcors Hy-Grade Pellets and Steel Corporation of Gujarat for Rs 1,950 crore.

 Both companies are now wholly-owned subsidiaries of Essar Steel, the company said.

 With these buyouts, Essar Steel is now a fully-integrated steel producer with end-to-end control over raw materials, processes, technologies and finished products.

 The acquisition of Hy-grade Pellets will bring in quality raw material and considerably better yields in steel making. 

 The company operates a 4-million-tonne per annum pellet plant at Visakhapatnam.

 Steel Corporations buyout will add value across the chain.

 We expect these acquisitions to bring in increased synergy and seamless integration in our operations and help strengthen the company, managing director Prashant Ruia said.

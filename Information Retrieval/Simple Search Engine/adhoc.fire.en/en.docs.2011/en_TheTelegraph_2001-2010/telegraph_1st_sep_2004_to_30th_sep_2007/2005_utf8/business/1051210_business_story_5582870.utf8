 New Delhi, Dec. 9: After LG, Samsung will be the second Korean chaebol to make mobile phones in India.

 The company expects to roll out its first mobile handset from its facility at Manesar in Haryana by March. The unit will become functional by the first week of January and will make phones based on the global system for mobile communications (GSM) technology.

 Samsung India director (telecom) H.C. Ryu said, Initially, we will develop a mobile handset priced at around Rs 5000 for the mid-size market. This facility will be a critical turning point for our mobile business in the country.

 At present, LG is the only company that manufactures handsets in India. LG rolled out its first GSM handset from its Pune plant in March last year. At present, the unit makes four models with prices starting from Rs 4995.

 Nokia, which has also announced its plan to set up a handset manufacturing facility here, plans to launch it first India-made phone in June next year.

 Samsung India will invest $15 million in the unit ? the fourth after China, Brazil and Mexico. The plant will have an initial capacity of 1 million mobile handsets that will be upgraded to 10 million by 2006 and 20 million per annum by 2010.

 The company will customise its handsets with local software, which will be developed by its software operations unit in Bangalore. The company has requested its vendors in Korea to set up shop in India or train local vendors to supply components.

 We will set up a proper vendor supply chain locally, since it is in our interest. Without it, manufacturing in India has no meaning, said Ryu. The company will adopt a different route to address the entry-level market and capture a substantial share, said Ryu. But he refused to divulge the route to sell entry-level sub-Rs 2000 handsets.

 The company will employ 200 people at the facility and will invest $10 million in the plant. Ryu dismissed fears of labour unrest in the state that was witnessed at the Honda factory early this year.

 A large domestic market, faster response, flexibility for manufacturing and greater product category are the reasons for setting up a mobile handset manufacturing plant in India, Ryu said.

 The company today launched three mobile handsets ? SCH-N710 priced at Rs 14,699, SGH-N710 priced at Rs 3,199 and SGH-X660 for Rs 8,599.

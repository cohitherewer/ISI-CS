 New Delhi, June 2: Hyundai Motor India will introduce new versions of the Sonata and the Accent. While the Sonata will be launched next month, the Accent is expected to hit the roads by early 2007.

 ?The new Sonata is coming in July. The Accent can be expected anytime between September next year and January 2007,? president B. V. R. Subbu said. 

 Talking about the Korean carmaker?s plans to introduce commercial vehicles (CV) here, he said: ?We will have to wait. At the moment, our focus is on expanding the domestic car segment as well as exports. There will not be any development in the CV segment before 2007.?

 Hyundai also brushed aside a threat for Getz ? its premium hatchback model ? from Suzuki?s Swift.

 ?We don?t see any threat for Getz from Swift. The two cars belong to absolutely different categories. Swift is in the category of Santro. Hence, these two cars will face similar competition,? Subbu said. 

 Following the Swift launch, there were rumours that the Korean giant will have to slash prices of its popular Getz model.

 However, Hyundai maintained that it would not reduce prices of either Getz or Santro. ?There is no immediate plan to revise prices for Santro. It is too early to say. We will have to wait and watch,? Subbu said.

 The 1.3-litre Getz, launched in September last year, is priced between Rs 4.5-4.85 lakh against Swift?s price tag ranging between Rs 3.87 lakh and Rs 4.85 lakh. 

 Hyundai has sold 12,706 Getz cars since its launch. Maruti claims that it has made bookings for as many as 15,000 Swift cars since the launch.

 HMIL has sold 23,206 cars in May compared with 12,712 in the same month last year. The carmaker sold 14,001 (7,739) cars in the domestic market and exported 9,205 vehicles during the month under review.

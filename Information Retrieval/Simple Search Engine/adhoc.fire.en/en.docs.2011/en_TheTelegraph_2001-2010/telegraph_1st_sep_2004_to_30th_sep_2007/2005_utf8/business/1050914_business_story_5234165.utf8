 Calcutta, Sept. 13: Samsung India is targeting a 40 per cent growth in sales from electronics and home appliances during the festive season. 

 Deputy managing director Ravinder Zutshi said, Our growth strategy is to aggressively launch innovative products in all categories. The focus on technological improvements in all products has been the driving factor this year.

 We are confident of achieving the Rs 6500-crore turnover target set for this year (January?December 2005), he added.

 The company had registered a turnover of Rs 4,900 crore last year.

 The Korean major expects sales during the two-month festive season to touch Rs 625 crore, which is a 40 per cent increase over the corresponding period last year. It has set aside Rs 35 crore for promotional activities during this period.

 The consumer durables division contributes 53 per cent to the companys turnover, while the rest comes from IT and telecom products.

 We have set a target of selling 15 lakh colour TVs, 6.5 lakh refrigerators and 3.25 lakh washing machines. We will sell over 2 lakh air-conditioners and 1 lakh microwaves this year, he added. DVDs will also grow from 3 lakh units sold last year to 20 lakh this year.

 Samsung has a 21 per cent share of the flat TV market and 15 per cent of the conventional TV segment. 

 In washing machines and refrigerators, its share is around 12 per cent. In air-conditioners and microwaves, the company enjoys a 20 per cent and 25 per cent share respectively.

 Samsung expects to double its air-conditioner business. It is also targeting a 25 per cent growth in frost-free refrigerators and 20 per cent in microwave ovens.

 The company is also seeing a good growth in smaller towns and semi-urban cities with 30 per cent of its revenues coming from these areas. These areas are showing an affinity for upgradation and purchase of lifestyle products like home-theatres.

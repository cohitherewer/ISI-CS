 New Delhi, Feb. 23: Nokia is in an advanced stage of discussions with two state governments to set up a manufacturing unit in India. The company will hold its board meeting in Delhi during the first week of May to decide on the size and location of the project.

 Besides Nokia, several other telecom equipment manufacturers like Alcatel, Ericsson, Lucent, Motorola and Nortel have told Union communications minister Dayanidhi Maran that they intend to establish manufacturing plants in India.

 The government expects to get a flow of foreign direct investment of about $800 million for manufacturing mobile handsets and telecom equipment during the financial year 2005-06.

 Carl-Henvric Savnberg, worldwide CEO of Ericsson, has told Maran that they have picked Jaipur in Rajasthan as the location for their plant to manufacture GSM equipment. The company will send a proposal next month after due consideration at various levels.

 Maran said, ?Nokia has zeroed in on two states and is in talks with the state governments. In addition to the financial incentives, their wish list indicates that they are looking for a state with a good airport facility. They do not want to use ports since the supply of handsets has to be fast to meet the customers? demands.? 

 The minister was briefing reporters after his visit to France where he had attended the third GSM World congress. Maran had interactions with Jorma Ollila, chairman and CEO of Nokia. 

 There are indications that Nokia will choose between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to locate the plant.

 Maran said though India has allowed 100 per cent FDI in the manufacturing sector, it has not led to the expected growth. To surpass the target of providing 250 million telephone connections over the next three years, the country has to reduce dependence on imports.

 The minister also had interactions with Alcatel chairman Serge Tchurk and reviewed the agreement of technology transfer to ITI for switching equipment. 

 Maran said the telecom equipment manufacturers were concerned about the viability of their plants after the zero import duty regime for telecom products comes into effect from March 1.

 A committee consisting of telecom equipment manufacturers and communication ministry officials has already examined the issue and the state government and finance ministry have been informed about the wish list, said Nipendra Misra, secretary in the department of telecommunications.

 Maran said, ?Indias strength lies in the governments target of providing 250 million telephone connections by the year 2007 and the population of more than 1 billion which presents a huge potential. quot;

 He said, ?We will extend all possible help to telecom equipment manufacturers. This should have happened 2-3 years earlier but the policies and environment are now conducive. Things are looking good now and the Indian market will attract the manufacturers into India.?

 Posco MoU on schedule

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, June 15: Pohang Steel Co, the Korean steel giant, will sign the memorandum of understanding with the Orissa government on June 22 for setting up the 12-million tonne steel plant at Paradip, confirmed Ryu Ho Chang, the companys India representative.

 The project is part of the companys drive to expand its production globally. It is planning to build a 12-million-tonne steel plant, a 30-million-tonne iron ore mine, a mill for making hot-rolled coil and a port. The mill will start production by June 2010. The entire project is likely to cost $12 billion.

 Posco officials said construction is set to start in July or October next year. Orissa steel minister Padmanabha Behera also confirmed the date for signing the MoU.

 Posco is talking to global mining major BHP Billiton for construction of the sea port and mining facilities.

 The steel major has agreed not to export ore from India, said sources in the company. 

 A couple of months ago, Posco, the fifth largest steel company in the world, had pulled out of negotiations with the Orissa government after reported disagreement over iron ore export.

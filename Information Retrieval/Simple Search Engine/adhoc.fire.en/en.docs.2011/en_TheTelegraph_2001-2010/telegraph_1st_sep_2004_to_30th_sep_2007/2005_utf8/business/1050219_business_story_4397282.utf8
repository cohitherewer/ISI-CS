 ONGC taps Kazakh firms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb 18: ONGC-Videsh (OVL) today formally made an offer to Kazakh oil companies for immediate participation in two oilfields and two exploration blocks in Kazakhstan. These include the Tengiz and Kashagan oilfields and the Kurmangazy and Darkhan exploration blocks.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar presented this list of four ?category I? assets, in which OVL is ready to invest immediately, to Kazakhstan President V. Shkolnik in Astana. The minister is on a two-day visit to Kazakhstan as part of his oil diplomacy to increase the overseas presence of Indian companies.

 The Indian minister also listed another nine exploration blocks in which OVL would like to evaluate exploration and production opportunities through the technical working group that is proposed in the MoU signed between the two countries. These include Evageny, Makhambet, Istai and Tolkin, which come under ?category II? of the Indian list. 

 These nine blocks have been identified in the Caspian Sea and OVL does not have enough technical information to evaluate the prospects. The exact position regarding these blocks would become clear after the evaluation is undertaken in association with the Kazakh companies.

 Aiyar made a broad-based offer to the Kazakh President, which covers the entire range of activities in the oil and gas sector. The Indian minister informed Shkolnik that Gail (India) Ltd would like to be considered as a project consortium partner and offer services in pipeline operations and management in three pipeline projects linking Kazakhstan with China. Gail is also ready to invest in gas processing and petrochemical plants in association with other Indian public sector companies at Atyrau and Akhtau in Kazakhstan. 

 Apart from the ?category I? oilfields, the Indian minister has offered to carry out seismic surveys to establish the prospects of new fields in Kazakhstan, which have not been surveyed at all. This forms the lowest rung of oil exploration activity and Aiyar appears to be keen to drive home the message that India was not only interested in the more lucrative assets but keen to have a broad-based co-operative agreement in the hydrocarbon sector.

 India has also offered to jointly undertake exercises in improved and enhanced oil recovery to increase the output of the older fields in Kazakhstan.

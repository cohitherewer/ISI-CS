 Death trap for debt funds

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, March 9: Talk about devil in the print. All those who felt the stock market was an unsafe animal with a volatile temper and were betting on safer debt funds are in for a shock. 

 After this year?s budget, the dividend distribution tax has just been increased for them.

 Even as finance minister P. Chidambaram has exempted equity-based schemes, the tax not only remains but has gone up for debt funds.

 For individuals, the effective distribution tax has gone up to 14 per cent. Though the tax now stands at 10 per cent, with surcharge and education cess, the actual money that will be deducted will be 14 per cent. 

 However the worst hit will be corporate houses that have been investing in such funds. The tax for them has gone up to 20 per cent. Along with the surcharge, the effective rate will be 22.5 per cent.

 With the government signalling a low interest rate regime, debt funds will in any case lose some of their sheen. Debt funds, which have seen their returns badly crimped after the glory days of 2002, will now go through the wringer because of the high taxation compared with equity-based funds. 

 Is it an unintended slight or is it a planned move to shift retail investor?s focus to the stock market and away from play-safe avenues? 

 ?Differential tax treatment is often resorted to by the government in case it wants to channel money out of one form of investment or savings into another,? says Sudatta Sen, an independent market analyst. 

 Mutual funds are, however, not complaining as the stock market is booming and their profits as well as rate of return is going up virtually everyday. 

 The Bombay Stock Exchange?s bellwether index has shot up in the last few days since the budget was announced and is now tantalisingly close to another milestone. 

 Till some time back, foreign institutional investors were the principal buyers in the market, while domestic mutual funds were net sellers. With the stock market firing on all cylinders, mutual funds are all geared up to join the buying party. 

 Analysts say that mutual funds are sitting on a huge cash pile as they have raised over Rs 5000 crore in the past two months through initial public offerings.

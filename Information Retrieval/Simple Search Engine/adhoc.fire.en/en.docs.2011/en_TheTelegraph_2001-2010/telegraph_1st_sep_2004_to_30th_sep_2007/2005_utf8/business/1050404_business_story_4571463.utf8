 Power Trading to shop for stakes

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, April 3: Power Trading Corporation of India (PTC) has shortlisted 35 power projects where the company will pick up equity up to 15 per cent.

 Senior PTC officials said the total generation capacity of these projects is 2,309 MW. The company is already in talks with them for power purchase.

 PTC?s list includes Vadinar power project, Kameng hydro power project, Maithon thermal project and Gujarat Paguthan combined cycle gas project.

 This is in addition to PTC?s decision to acquire equity worth Rs 30 crore in Lanco Amarkantak Private Power Limited ? a project that is coming up in Chhattisgarh.

 PTC will pick up an 11 per cent stake in the 300-MW power project in Chhattisgarh. The money generated will be used to finance the coal-based project that will be implemented by Lanco.

 Company officials said, ?We have finalised picking up an 11 per cent stake in the power project, which is the first of its kind for us.?

 The company will be looking for more such equity participation in different power projects, including water and gas-based, for over 25 years. 

 Officials said they have received several enquiries for equity participation. 

 ?We have already identified 35 power projects. We will soon finalise a few of them,? they said.

 The business plan worked out by PTC in consultation with Crisil Advisory Services also envisages the power major?s participation in the equity of other utilities.

 PTC expects that the volume of trade will increase to 30,090 million units by 2009-10. 

 Business opportunities in the short-term arise primarily from the power made available by WBPDCL, Malana Hydro Power Project, UPCL, Chukha and Kurichhu power projects and other inter-regional trading.

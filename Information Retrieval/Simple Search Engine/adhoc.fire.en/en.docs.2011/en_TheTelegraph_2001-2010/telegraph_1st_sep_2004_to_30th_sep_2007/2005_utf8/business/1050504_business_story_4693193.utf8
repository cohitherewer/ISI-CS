 New Delhi, May 3: Communications minister Dayanidhi Maran hopes to persuade Intel chief Craig Barrett to set up a computer chip manufacturing unit in India when he visits the Santa Clara-based chipmaker?s headquarters next month.

 Maran reckons India will soon attract IT and telecom component makers after successfully persuading mobile handset manufacturer Nokia to set up a plant in the country. 

 The minister will try to convince Barrett that the infrastructure in India is capable of meeting the demands of a company like Intel. 

 Last November, Barrett had reminded the Indian government about the need to improve the infrastructure if it wants more investments from information technology hardware manufacturers.

 The Intel chief said India is one of the several countries it is considering to set up a manufacturing unit. 

 He said not only the Indian government but nations around the world need to recognise that a company like Intel builds one manufacturing unit in a year. 

 Barrett said, ?There are probably 100 countries in the world that would like to have that manufacturing plant in their country. So, as soon as you recognise that it is a very competitive environment and then start to look at the issues of transportation, customs, utilities, government rules and regulations, you realise what a competitive issue it is.?

 He reminded that Intel established a manufacturing plant in China, and not in India, because that country was more developed in manufacturing infrastructure or utility infrastructure, transportation as well as customs.

 ?I will not say no to the question whether we will put up a manufacturing facility in India. India is one of the several countries that we are currently evaluating from a manufacturing perspective,? Barrett said.

 Speaking on sidelines at a seminar on Sharing of Experiences between Department of Telecom and British Telecom, here today, Maran said, ?I want to bring manufacturing into India. I will meet Intel chief Barrett next month in the US to ask him to set up a chip-making factory in India. Intel has identified India and China as key destination for manufacturing. My counterpart from China is already there. I also want to pitch in for my country.?

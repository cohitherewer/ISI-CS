The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Testing time for BPO boys

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Karnik: Quality conscious

 Calcutta, Feb. 19: The lure of walk-in interviews and a plum back-office job may lose some of its sheen with the industry seriously thinking of setting an eligibility criteria for joining this sector.

 With only seven out of 100 candidates meeting the required standards, the industry feels there is an immediate need to hone the skills of students in academic and technical institutes to generate skilled human resources for BPO jobs.

 Nasscom, the apex body for the software industry, has taken a lead in this matter and will roll out a pilot certification project within two months that will screen BPO-job applicants at the entry level. The apex body will zero in on two locations for the project by March.

 Speaking at a seminar on human resource development for the BPO industry, held at the Ramakrishna Mission in Belur today, Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said, ?The situation is grim. There is an urgent need to define skills that are specific to the industry. It is also necessary to refine the skills of the existing workers and work out a long-term objective.?

 Nasscom, in partnership with Hewitt Associates, has already worked out an industry standard for human resource training certification and assessment of BPO firms.

 ?The screening will be through an entrance examination that will be modelled on the lines of the IIT/IIM tests,? Karnik said. ?This will also help us broaden the scope for employment and provide opportunities to candidates across the country, even in remote locations.?

 The group is finalising the certifying body, which is expected to be decided by March. The certification body will combine the specific skill requirements of the industry as suggested by HR representatives of various companies and integrate it into the examination.

 The parameters are mainly based on team work, attitude to work, communication skills and ability to perform.

Software exports

 Karnik said the total exports of the infotech industry, including software, hardware and BPO, is set to cross the Rs 100,000-crore mark in the next few days.

 It?s time for a fee break

 Scrapping of demat charges will help the clumsy investor, says Chandralekha Tulal

No longer will you have to pay for your inefficiency in managing your ever-growing portfolio.

 Last week, Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chairman G. N. Bajpai announced the decision to do away with account opening and custody charges for demat accounts effective January 31.

 The move is expected to encourage retail participation in the stock market and comes in response to a longstanding demand to reduce the various charges on depository accounts. It is a welcome move: any reduction in cost directly results in incremental profit, no matter by how minuscule an amount.

 A senior depository participant (DP) official says this is a move by the regulator to bring discipline in the market. The two depositories ? NSDL and CDSL ? do not charge any account opening fees. However, both the regulator and the depositories had given the freedom to the participants to prepare their individual fee structures. Initially, most of them charged account opening fees, but the fiercely competitive market of financial services saw almost all of them doing away with it. Thus, the impact of such a waiver will not be felt much.

 However, the impact of abolishing custodial fees will be greatly appreciated by those who are essentially disorganised in their portfolio management and trading.

 Let us examine how. Custodial fees are charged on the basis of an International Security Identification Number (ISIN). ISIN refers to the identification number given to each security when it is admitted into the depository system by Sebi and is common to both NSDL and CDSL.

 Regardless of how many shares one holds in each security or ISIN, one has to pay for the number of months the security is held by him. While CDSL does not charge any custodial fees, NSDL charges 75 paise per month per ISIN to its participants. Again, the DPs have the freedom to structure the charge, which may range from 75 paise to Rs 1.50 per month per ISIN.

 An organised investor, who adheres to investment objectives and regularly rebalances the portfolio, will not incur any extra cost for unrequited scrips. Take an investor who at any point of time does not have more than 20 scrips in his demat account. At 75 paise per ISIN per month, on an average he pays Rs 180 per annum as custodial charges. It does not affect him much as he books profits according to his target return expectations and simply adjusts the fees against his gains.

 On the other side, consider an investor who buys stocks and forgets about them. He goes on accumulating numerous scrips of which he has no use but goes on paying holding costs month after month. Let us assume that till date he holds as many as 50 scrips. Thus, on an average, he shells out as much as Rs 450 per annum and the cost is sure to go up with each passing month, while the value of shares in custody may actually be getting eroded.

 This has been a very sore point for numerous retail investors. The value of their holding is usually small, but the charges paid as percentage of that worked out to be quite high. With the blessing of Sebi, even the most laidback investor will not be required to pay the cost of holding scrips.

 New Delhi, Oct. 5 The committee on infrastructure headed by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today cleared the special purpose vehicle for funding infrastructure projects. It also gave its nod to the model concession agreement for undertaking highway projects.

 The SPV, which is expected to make available about Rs 10,000 crore for various infrastructure projects this fiscal, is likely to take off in a months time.

 Finance minister P Chidambaram told journalists after the meeting, the committee considered and finalised two notes ? one on SPV and another on the procedure for public-private partnership in road projects. They will go to the cabinet committee on economic affairs tomorrow for approval.

 The major focus of the SPV would be public as well as public-private partnership projects in roads, ports, the Mumbai and Delhi airports and rail freight corridor, according to senior officials. 

 Chidambaram denied any differences between the Planning Commission and finance ministry on the proposed SPV. He said in todays meeting the structure, management, mandate, terms of lending and refinance were discussed. There is a complete agreement on the note, the minister added.

 The infrastructure SPV was announced as part of Chidmabrams budget for the current financial year along with the viability gap funding scheme of another Rs 1,500 crore. The two schemes were proposed to give the much-needed fillip to the countrys infrastructure projects that were not taking off due to paucity of funds.

 The new model concession agreement for road projects on build, operate and transfer basis seeks to link the duration of the concession period to actual traffic realisation on roads. The concession period would vary from 12-20 years.

 According to Planning Commission officials, the framework for the SPV will be flexible enough and the option for refinancing of existing projects will be there.

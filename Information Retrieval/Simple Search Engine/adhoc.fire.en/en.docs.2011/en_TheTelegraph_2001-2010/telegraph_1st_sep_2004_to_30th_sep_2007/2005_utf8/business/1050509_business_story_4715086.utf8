 Sify ADR proposal deferred

 New Delhi, May 8 (PTI): Internet service provider Sifys proposal to issue American depository receipts (ADR) got a jolt when the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) deferred the plan by two weeks.

 Until a formal policy is announced on FDI in ISPs providing virtual private network (VPN) services in India, the FIPB has decided to postpone the consideration of the proposal at the behest of the department of telecom (DoT). 

 The department wants the proposal to be put off since the issue of foreign investment in ISPs providing VPN services is a policy matter that is under review. A final view on this may take some time. Its revised policy note, however, has already been sent to the department of economic affairs.

 The current foreign holding in Sify is 58 per cent and after the proposed issue it would have increased to 100 per cent.

 In January this year, DoT had issued a provisional clearance to Sify for the VPN service.

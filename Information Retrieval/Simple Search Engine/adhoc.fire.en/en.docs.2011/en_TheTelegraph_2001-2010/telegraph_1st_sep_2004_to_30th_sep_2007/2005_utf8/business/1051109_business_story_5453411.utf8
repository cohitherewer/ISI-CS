 Calcutta, Nov. 8: Fan manufacturer Khaitan Electricals hopes to clock a turnover of Rs 200 crore during the current fiscal with the diversification into the lights segment. Last year, the company reported a revenue of Rs 129 crore.

 We will invest Rs 20 crore, including working capital, in the lights business over a period of 8-10 months, said Sunil K. Khaitan, vice chairman and managing director, Khaitan Electricals Limited.

 Meanwhile, we will set up a new factory at Kala Amb in Himachal Pradesh, said Khaitan. The construction of the plant will commence from December and will be funded from internal accruals.

 The company has introduced a whole range of electrical solutions such as domestic wires and cables, miniature circuit breakers, isolators and distribution boards.

 The main objective behind the diversification is to provide a complete bouquet of electrical solutions for the Indian household, Khaitan explained.

 The company also plans to enter the electrical home appliances market and for this, the company has applied for the ISI license. We plan to enter the market with 15 products including iron, mixer, water heaters, et al. But we will not get into the white goods segment, Khaitan said.

 We plan to outsource the products initially from other manufacturers and after testing the water for a couple of years, we will start manufacturing them at our Himachal Pradesh plant, he added.

 Khaitan Electricals is also keenly considering spread its wings beyond the countrys boundaries. At present, we export to West Asian and West African countries. We are now targeting the US market and have applied for necessary licences there, said Khaitan.

 Currently, the company is manufacturing compact fluorescent lamps at its factory at Paonta Sahib in Himachal Pradesh. Khaitan Electricals market share in the CFL segment is expected to rise to 10 per cent from six per cent now.

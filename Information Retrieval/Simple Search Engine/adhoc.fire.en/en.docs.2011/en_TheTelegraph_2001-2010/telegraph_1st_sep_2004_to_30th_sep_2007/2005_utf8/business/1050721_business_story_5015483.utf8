 GE set to invest in infotech park fund

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 20: GE Commercial Finance Real Estate has proposed to invest $63 million in the India IT Parks Fund, marking its foray into commercial real estate market in the country.

 The fund is sponsored by Asias leading business space provider, Ascendas Pte Ltd (Ascendas). Ascendas has also invested in the fund along with other international players.

 The UPA government had relaxed foreign investment norms in the budget by bringing down the minimum acreage for a foreign investor from 100 to 25 acres.

 The newly-launched fund will cash in on the boom in the countrys services outsourcing industry.

 GE Commercial, which is part of General Electric, manages assets worth more than $28 billion (Rs 1,24,600 crore) worldwide, of which at least 25 per cent is invested in the Asia Pacific at present.

 Many foreign bulge-bracket investors are eyeing the Indian real estate market. Recently, HDFC Ltd chairman Deepak Parekh had said at least 20-25 foreign investors were interested in India.

 Our investment with Ascendas underscores GEs commitment to increasing its presence in the Indian commercial real estate market, said Scott Bayman, president and chief executive officer of GE India.

 The Rs 1000-crore ($230 million) India IT Parks Fund was launched last month by Ascendas. It plans to double the funds size in seven years. The fund plans to acquire and develop up to approximately $500 million in assets over the next seven years.

 Kant to steer Tata Motors

 Kant: Top job

 Mumbai, July 29: After almost a decade, Tata Motors has finally got itself a managing director.

 Ravi Kant, in-charge of the commercial vehicle business unit of Tata Motors since 1999, will take control of the day-to-day affairs of the automobile company with immediate effect.

 The appointment comes at a time when the fifth-largest commercial vehicles maker in the world with a sizeable interest in passenger cars has announced plans to go global.

 The board approved Kants appointment today and chairman Ratan Tata broke the news personally to him.

 Industry circles have believed that Tata Motors will never have a CEO as Ratan Tata has a great passion for automobiles and devotes significant amount of time for the company. Tata had steered the company out of a Rs 500-crore loss a few years back. It has since bounced back to profit after a painful restructuring and with the help of the Indica. 

 Tata Motors is poised to make an impact as a global player and much of the action has so far centred around the commercial vehicles unit, the sector that Ravi Kant heads.

 Tata Motors is also developing a small car that will be priced close to Rs 1 lakh.

 Kant has helped integrate Daewoo Commercial Vehicles, a South Korean company that Tata Motors acquired a couple of years ago. 

 The company beat analysts forecasts on Friday with a 22 per cent rise in quarterly net profit as strong sales of buses and trucks offset high raw material costs. 

 The company, with more than a 60 per cent share of Indias truck and bus market, said net profit rose to Rs 272.67 crore in the first quarter to June from Rs 223.36 crore a year earlier.

 Syndicate Bank issue priced at Rs 50

 New Delhi, July 17 (PTI): Syndicate Bank has priced its public offer at Rs 50 a share, which was oversubscribed by almost 30 times. It had set a price band of Rs 46-50 for the follow-on issue offering 5 crore shares at a face value of Rs 10 each.

 Syndicate Banks share had closed at Rs 63 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Friday. The issue price is at a 21 per cent discount to its going rate. 

 The bank has received bids worth Rs 6,000 crore against the targeted Rs 250 crore. On the opening day of July 7, the issue was oversubscribed more than 14 times with 60.90 per cent bids from foreign institutional investors, followed by 22.66 per cent from mutual funds.

 After the issue, the governments holding in the bank will come down from 73.5 per cent to 66.5 per cent, but its capital base will increase to Rs 5,219 crore from Rs 4,719 crore. 

 This will improve the banks capital adequacy ratio and enable it to conform to the Basel-II norms coming into effect from 2007.

 Syndicate Bank first came out with a public offer of 12.5 crore shares in 1999.

 For the follow-on issue, it has reserved 50 lakh shares for employees, 2.25 crore for qualified institutional buyers, 67.5 lakh for non-institutional buyers and 1.57 crore for retail investors.

 Reliance Energy quarterly profit at Rs 159 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 19: Reliance Energy today posted a nearly 25 per cent jump in its net profit for the second quarter ended September 30 last. Net profit of the power utility rose to Rs 159.57 crore from Rs 128.13 crore in the year-ago period, reflecting a 24.53 per cent growth.

 The increase in earnings came on the back of a robust rise in income from EPC and contracts that jumped to Rs 233.40 crore from Rs 88.02 in the corresponding quarter last year. Other income, too, went up sharply to Rs 118.47 crore (Rs 86.82 crore). Net sales of energy grew to Rs 809.49 crore from Rs 703.71 crore in the same period last year.

 For the April-September period, net profit stood at Rs 316 crore against Rs 231 crore, an increase of 37 per cent. The total income for this period clocked at Rs 2246 crore (Rs 1898 crore), indicating a rise of 18 per cent.

 REL said that in the first six months, it sold electrical energy 4,178 million units less than 4,219 million units last year. This decline was primarily due to lower generation at Samalkot because of lower gas availability. Its aggregate revenue from energy sales was Rs 1593 crore (Rs 1503 crore) during the half-year in which the companys consumer base in Mumbai increased by about 25,000 to 24.1 lakh. 

 The turnover of EPC and contracts division was Rs 400 crore, which is 72 per cent higher than Rs 232 crore achieved last year. The division, REL said, has an order book position of about Rs 3500 crore as on September 30. 

 The other income of the company rose 55 per cent to Rs 253 crore mainly on account of increased interest income.

 The first six months of 2005-06 saw equity capital of the company increasing to Rs 202 crore from Rs 185.65 crore, consequent upon the conversion of equity warrants allotted on preferential basis to the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprises and FIIs and part conversion of outstanding foreign currency convertible bonds. The preferential offer garnered Rs 1720 crore for REL.

 Gujarat Ambuja

 Gujarat Ambuja Cements posted disappointing results for the second quarter of 2005-06. The net profit of the company on a stand-alone basis fell 17 per cent to Rs 75.28 crore compared with Rs 90.46 crore in the corresponding period last year. The major markets of the company were hit by flood and that affected its earnings. 

 The consolidated net profit rose 7 per cent to Rs 108.06 crore during the quarter against Rs 100.99 crore last year, these numbers were also below analyst expectations.

 GACL said sales growth during the quarter was flat due to floods in Gujarat and Maharashtra.

 Calcutta, Dec. 6: NSE.IT Limited, National Stock Exchanges wholly-owned IT subsidiary, is exploring possibilities of selling its complete exchange solutions in the overseas capital markets.

 The company wants to expand its activities from providing infrastructure support to NSE brokers and other exchange centric activities to selling data recovery and risk management services. 

 We are now focussing on exchange solutions rather than broker-related models, senior vice-president N. Muralidaran told reporters on the sidelines of a conference organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 NSE.IT Limited was set up in 1999 to provide IT infrastructure support to brokers of NSE.

 We are also looking at overseas assignments like implementing stock exchange solutions and risk management systems, said Muralidaran. Various overseas exchanges from the Gulf and African countries look upon India as the role model in stock exchange facilities. Such exchanges have evinced interest in the solutions developed by us, he added.

 Muralidaran said the solutions would be customised according to the requirements of individual exchanges due to varying rules and regulations regarding risk management and disclosure practices. We will offer complete end-to-end solutions for exchanges, including infrastructure support, software and integrate management practices, he added.

 The company is also offering data retrieval and disaster recovery solutions for banks and financial institutions. HDFC is one of our clients, said Muralidaran.

 We have also been approached by some derivative exchanges of developed countries to offer them risk management solutions, he said.

 A month back, we have launched a brokers solution, which integrates the two major stock exchanges of the country ? Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange ? with commodity exchanges MCX and NCDEX and provides live prices on a single screen, he said. This product would enable the jobbers and day traders to get arbitrage.

 The paid-up capital of NSE.IT is Rs 10 crore and has reserves of Rs 6.09 crore. For 2004-05, the company posted a revenue of around Rs 40 crore and net profit of Rs 3.49 crore for 2004-05, he said.

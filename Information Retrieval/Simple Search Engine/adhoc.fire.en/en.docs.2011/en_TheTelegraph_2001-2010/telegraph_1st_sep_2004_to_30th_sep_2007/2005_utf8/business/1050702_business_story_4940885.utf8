 Calcutta, July 1: Yamaha, the worlds second-largest motorbike manufacturer, was so far an also-ran in the Indian market. 

 Not any more. The company is planning to ramp up its market share five fold to match its global share.

 In the process, it will make India the second-largest production hub within the Yahama family, after Indonesia.

 Local capacity will go up from 3.5 lakh to one million by 2009-10, said Hiroyuki Yanagi, chief executive officer and managing director of Yahama Motor India (YMIL). 

 YMIL is the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Japanese giant. It is fifth-largest bike manufacturing hub in the parents stable, trailing Indonesia, Thailand, Taiwan and Vietnam. 

 Like most other multinationals, the cost advantage is keeping the global giant in India. The cost of production is half here, Yanagi said here today.

 The company favours India over China, where bike sales are much higher, because the market is more stable here.

 The Chinese market, though huge, is tricky. There are so many brands and the competition is very tough too, he added.

 India is seen as the base for low-end motorbikes. Yamaha is yet to come up with a specific investment figure to achieve the second spot in another five years.

 In the next two years, YMIL will invest about Rs 500 crore in capacity expansion, marketing as well as research and development. 

 Yahamas market share in India stands at 5-6 per cent. We are looking at a 10 per cent market share by 2008. That is our first priority, he added.

 The company will step up production from the current level in a phased manner to 5 lakh, then 8 lakh and finally to one million.

 YMIL plans to stay focused on the upper end of the spectrum as its core competence lies there.

 It will bring in various bike versions in future. As part of its branding exercise, it has roped in model-turned-actor John Abraham.

 Singh to head energy panel

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, July 13: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has set up a high-level energy co-ordination committee (ECC), which will guide the government in formulating policies for the sector. 

 The committee, to be headed by the Prime Minister, will collate the responses of all ministries on improving the energy security of the country.

 The committee will consist of the Union ministers of finance, power, petroleum, coal and non-conventional energy sources, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, chairman of the Prime Ministers economic advisory council, national security adviser and cabinet secretary. Principal secretary to the Prime Minister will be the convenor.

 The ECC will be serviced by the Prime Ministers office. The energy division of the Planning Commission will facilitate analysis of any policy required by the committee. 

 It will co-ordinate preparatory work on energy policy and security issues. The committee may also commission specialised studies depending on the requirement, which may arise from time to time. 

 The committee will identify key areas for energy policy initiative, so as to meet the overall objectives of economic development, energy security and efficiency. It will monitor vulnerable areas that directly impinge on energy security.

 ECC will follow up on the implementation of policy initiatives and identify institutional mechanisms to implement them. It will also periodically monitor key policy issues.

 Earlier this week, the petroleum ministrys committee on synergy in energy had favoured setting up a cabinet committee on energy headed by the Prime Minister and a separate energy ministry, as there is a need for an integrated energy policy.

 The Prime Ministers announcement comes at a time when the country is facing a difficult situation with global crude prices hovering around $60 a barrel.

 It was earlier thought that rally in international oil prices is a short-term phenomenon.

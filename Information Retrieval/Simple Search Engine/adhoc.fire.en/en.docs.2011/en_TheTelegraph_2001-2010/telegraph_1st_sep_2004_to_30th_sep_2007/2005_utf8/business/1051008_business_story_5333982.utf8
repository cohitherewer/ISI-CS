 Oil ministry suffers burns

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 7: The Prime Ministers office has pulled up the petroleum ministry for meddling in ONGCs Rs 25,000-crore investment plan to set up an LNG import terminal, power plant and petrochemicals project in Mangalore. The project had been cleared by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

 The move comes as a shot in the arm for Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) chairman Subir Raha, who has been at loggerheads with the petroleum ministry on the issue.

 Things swung in favour of Raha after the Karnataka chief minister himself took up the issue with the Prime Minister.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar had opposed the project on the ground that ONGC should concentrate on its core area of competence and not lose focus by diversifying into LNG, power and petrochemicals. However, since this was a huge investment package for Karnataka, the chief minister had approached the Prime Minister to get the project cleared.

 On July 15, the PMO had approved the project, which was to be taken up by ONGCs subsidiary Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) with the parent company providing the finances and guarantees.

 The petroleum ministry, however, directed ONGC in August to hold consultations with it regarding the financing of the project and MRPLs role in it. 

 The petroleum ministry had also directed MRPL not to go in for the power plant for lack of expertise and should look for a suitable partner like NTPC as a majority holder to implement the project. The PMO learnt of these developments in early September and asked the petroleum ministry to remove the conditions and implement the PMs order in toto.

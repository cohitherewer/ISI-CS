 MF peddlers cheque-mated

 Money-wise

 Mumbai, April 24: Mutual funds are trying to put a lid on payouts to distributors, whose aggregate commissions have skyrocketed to over Rs 200 crore in the space of a few months. This has been fuelled by the slew of new schemes that hit the primary markets recently.

 Some of the mutual funds in the recent past have enticed distributors with commissions as high as 4-5 per cent of the collection. Sources say some of this would have been recovered from subscriptions ? if they were high ? and the asset management firm?s corpus.

 However, a lot of the commission paid out went down the chute when distributors prodded investors to switch to new schemes within months. This way, the distributors pocketed attractive commissions again but the funds and investors ended as losers. ?A mutual fund is not a short-term investment. An investor has to stay for the long term to realise attractive returns,? an analyst said.

 ?We are preparing our distributors to accept more humble payouts of 2.5 per cent initially. This could be raised by 0.5 per cent annually if investors stay on in our schemes,? said a fund manager of a leading mutual fund. 

 Of late, the mutual fund industry has been rocked by unprecedented churning as investors move from one new scheme to another on the advice of distributors without realising that this is, eventually, a losing proposition. ?The investor doesn?t realise that a scheme taken up at Rs 10 (par value) will have a deduction of 2.5-4 per cent. This goes to the distributor,? the analyst said.

 Unit Trust of India pioneered the ?trail commission? in its Unit Linked Insurance Plan (Ulip), one of the institution?s most popular schemes, say industry sources. It is resorting to this again to make it attractive for distributors to keep investors in schemes for over a year.

 During a market bull-run, such overheads will not be a problem, especially if the sensex posts a 198 per cent return, like it did in the financial year ended March 2005. 

 At its highest levels this year, the index posted returns of 23 per cent, despite a blip in May. This has helped mutual funds? equity schemes turn in attractive returns. 

 From a modest sum of Rs 200-500 crore collected through IPOs last year, close to Rs 1,950 crore has been mopped by Franklin Templeton?s Flexi-cap Fund alone; Reliance Opportunities Fund has garnered around Rs 1,770 crore.

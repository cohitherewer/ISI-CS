 Calcutta, Feb. 17: Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) may miss the domestic sales target of 9.7 million tonnes in the current fiscal in spite of incremental growth across most of its products.

 The public sector steel company expects to register domestic sales of 9.5-9.6 million tonnes in 2004-05, which is 12 per cent higher than previous year?s sales of 8.5 million tonnes.

 S. K. Roongta, director (commercial), said, ?We had set an internal steep target for domestic sales at 9.7 million tonnes. But the production of steel suffered in the first two quarters because of shortage of coking coal. We could not meet the domestic demand during that period as production was less.?

 Even though the company may miss its target, it has witnessed a 4 per cent growth in domestic sales at 7.5 million tonnes. This will be backed by a 7 per cent increase in sales of finished steel during the first 10 months of the current fiscal against the year-ago period.

 Roongta said the company will supply 10 per cent more steel to the domestic market in the last quarter compared with the corresponding period of the previous year.

 SAIL has also re-oriented production and marketing strategies to cater to the surging demands from key segments like infrastructure and projects, housing, auto components and white goods.

 ?We are pro-active and in touch with customers, and planning our strategies accordingly. We expect the steel demand in the country to grow by 8 to 10 per cent next year,? Roongta added.

 SAIL expects the auto components sector to generate huge demand. The company has initiated talks with the auto component manufacturing association for future requirements, he said.

 Roongta said SAIL?s share in the white goods sector was not high and was restricted to around 5 to 10 per cent. The percentage would go up after the Bokaro CRM was modernised.

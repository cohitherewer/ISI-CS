 IDBI Homefinance raises variable rates

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, March 30: IDBI Homefinance, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IDBI Ltd, today announced a 25 basis point hike in its variable rate housing loans. 

 The revised variable interest rate is 7.75 per cent for loans up to five years and 8.25 per cent for those above 5 years and up to 15 years. For loans more than 15 years and up to 20 years, the rate will be 8.5 per cent. 

 According to the company, the revised interest rates will be applicable to all existing borrowers who have availed of the variable interest rate loans.

 This move came after the company reviewed its retail prime lending rate (RPLR)/ rack rate, which is the benchmark used for pricing its variable interest rate loans. The revised RPLR/ rack rate will be effective from March 31. 

 IDBI Homefinance said the revised interest rates are highly competitive and among the lowest in the industry. Sources said other housing finance companies and banks are unlikely to follow suit. ?The rates are likely to remain stable for some time now,? a senior official from a leading private sector bank pointed out.

 In November, HDFC had raised its floating rate loans by 50 basis points. Subsequently, revised rates for floating rate loans were at 7.5 per cent and above. The fixed rates continued to range between 8.25 and 8.75 per cent. This followed a rise in interest rates then due to higher inflation and shrinking liquidity.

 Melwyn Rego, managing director and CEO of IDBI Homefinance, said the company had over the past two years made several reductions in interest rates and it maintained its interest rate structure even during October?November 2004, when most housing finance firms and banks passed on the increased rates to their borrowers. 

 ?During that period, IDBI Homefinance deferred a review of interest rates and gave its customers the benefit of its low cost of funds, he added.

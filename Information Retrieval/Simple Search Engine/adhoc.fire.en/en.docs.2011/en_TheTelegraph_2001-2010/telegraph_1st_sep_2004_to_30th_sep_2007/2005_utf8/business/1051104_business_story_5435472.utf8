 Lipitor leeway opens for Ranbaxy

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 3: Ranbaxy Laboratories today said the UK high court, which on October 21 had ruled that the companys asorvastatin generic would infringe on Pfizers Lipitor patent, granted it permission to appeal against the ruling in the UK Court of Appeal. 

 The British court had ruled that the Ranbaxy generic would infringe on the basic Lipitor patent covering atorvastatin ? the core ingredient of the cholesterol reducing drug. The court also ruled that a second patent of Pfizer, covering the calcium salt of atorvastatin, is invalid.

 In its decision today, the UK high court granted permission to both Ranbaxy and Pfizer to appeal against the respective rulings in the UK Court of Appeal. The rulings on both appeals are expected late next year. 

 Ranbaxy, which has challenged Pfizers patents on Lipitor in several other European countries, sought to relinquish two British patents on the drug. 

 Pfizer also said it would appeal against the ruling to defend its patent that expires in July 2010.

 Unless it receives a favourable ruling in the appeal, Ranbaxy cannot introduce a generic version of atorvastatin in the UK before the second patent expires in November 2011.

 Having already been successful in invalidating one of the two Pfizer patents pertaining to atorvastatin in the UK, Ranbaxy plans to make use of it in its case on the infringement decision on the other patent before the UK Court of Appeal, said Malvinder Singh, Ranbaxy president and executive director. 

 We remain committed to our objective of bringing an affordable generic formulation of atorvastatin to the national health services in the UK, he added.

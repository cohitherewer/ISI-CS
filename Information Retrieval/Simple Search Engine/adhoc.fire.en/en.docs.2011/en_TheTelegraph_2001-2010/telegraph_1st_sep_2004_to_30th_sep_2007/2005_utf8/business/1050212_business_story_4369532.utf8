 Mumbai, Feb. 11: Swedish company SKF will purchase the outstanding publicly-held shares of its Indian subsidiary SKF India and delist it from bourses.

 ?Full ownership of the company will give SKF increased operational flexibility to support the development of its business and to fully integrate the operations with the SKF group,? SKF said.

 The offer to purchase the shares is subject to the approval for delisting by the shareholders of SKF India in keeping with the delisting norms of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and other approvals.

 SKF holds 53.58 per cent of the shares in the company and the total number of outstanding shares is 52,732,538, the company said.

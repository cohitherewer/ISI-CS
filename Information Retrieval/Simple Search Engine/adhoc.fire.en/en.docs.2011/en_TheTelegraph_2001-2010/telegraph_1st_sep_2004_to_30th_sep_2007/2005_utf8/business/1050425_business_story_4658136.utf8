 Mobile phone firms take job-generation call

 M. RAJENDRAN

 New Delhi, April 24: The mobile phone industry has emerged as a major employment generator, throwing up more than 3.6 million jobs during the past decade and holding out the promise of faster growth in the days ahead.

 Some 3.6 million jobs, including direct employment of 1.71 million, have been spawned. These have come from mobile service providers, dealers and distributors and part of the fixed network operators that service them.

 Then, there are 9.12 million jobs in support services. Out of these, 3 million arise in services that mobile operators buy against the 35,000 hands employed directly.

 Another 7.2 lakh jobs are generated through indirect expenditure of government revenues, interest payments and profits generated by mobile firms. Close to 1.8 million jobs are created, directly and indirectly, when the industry spends on network equipment and services.

 According to a case study prepared by OVUM for the GSM (global system for mobile communications) Association, employees of mobile operators also create jobs when they spend money on restaurants, holidays and food.

 However, the report says one should not expect a sudden spurt in employ- ment in the mobile phone industry.

 ?Revenues of cell firms are growing 50 per cent annually. But we do not expect the number of jobs dependent on the industry to rise quickly. 

 Wages will go up and so will productivity. But we do not see employment related to the industry growing more than 30 per cent during this financial year,? the report states.

 In future, OVUM expects jobs to emerge in the manufacture of telecom equipment in a way that makes India an export base, and from outsourcing of customer services.

 The report points to the recent trend of telecom equipment majors setting up factories in India.

 ?Such projects will create new jobs and this might eventually lead to India becoming an exporter rather than an importer of terminals and equipment,? states the report. 

 If that happens, India will be able to build on its strengths in outsourcing of customer services. 

 According to the National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom), about 15-20,000 Indian workers are engaged in customer support of cellular firms.

 With the development of mobile software services, Nasscom estimates an exponential jump in employment from the current base of close to 15,000 people. OVUM, however, does not count these jobs in its estimate of 3.6 million.

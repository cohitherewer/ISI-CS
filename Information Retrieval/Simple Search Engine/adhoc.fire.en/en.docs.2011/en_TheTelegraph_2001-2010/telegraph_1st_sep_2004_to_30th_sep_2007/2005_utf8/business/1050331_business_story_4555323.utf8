 Gopinath: Upbeat

 Mumbai, March 30: Air Deccan and Vijay Mallya?s Kingfisher Airlines have agreed to refrain from poaching on one another?s staff and ensure that there is no overlapping in flight destinations.

 ?Under an agreement finalised two days ago, we have decided to help each other for spare parts or inventories and even offer our Airbus A320 for training of Kingfisher?s pilots,? Air Deccan managing director G. R. Gopinath said.

 ?We have agreed on a method where we don?t poach from each other,? he said on the sidelines of the launch of the ICICI Bank Air Deccan Gold Card, a loyalty card programme for their customers.

 Both the airlines have a common type of aircraft (Airbus A320s) and engines. Regarding recent poaching on one another?s territory, there has been an extraordinary increase in salaries even as the airlines have dropped fares significantly.

 ?Let?s try and stabilise instead of artificially increasing salaries by over 50 per cent in the recent past,? Gopinath said. This is the first time that two private airlines have reached such an agreement, analysts said.

 Air Deccan went to court against a pilot, who had completed A320 training, quit and joined Kingfisher Airlines.

 Gopinath said, ?We will break even this year on a turnover of $94 million.?

 On tapping the market, Gopinath said, ?On an equity base of Rs 225 crore, we have already raised Rs 200 crore. We are now talking to institutional investors on the initial public offering (IPO) in the next 12-18 months.?

 Air Deccan plans to fly over four million passengers in the next financial year, four times more than the one million people it has flown since inception 18 months ago.

 The Bangalore-based Air Deccan now flies 18 aircraft on 106 routes daily and plans to add 100 flights every year over the next five years.

 Gopinath said nearly 40 per cent of Air Deccan passengers on any flight were first-time flyers, who have bought tickets at lower rates than conventional carriers.

 The no-frill Air Deccan sells 40 per cent of its tickets through the Internet and a business model of different pricing levels for tickets has been evolved by the carrier.

 Gopinath said the airline will add 68 aircraft, including 32 new Airbus 320, to its fleet beginning may, along with increasing destinations.

 Marginal rise in Oriental bottomline

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 6: State-owned Oriental Insurance Company today said it had garnered a gross premium of Rs 3,090.55 crore in 2004-05 against Rs 2,899.74 crore in the previous financial year. The insurers net profit had increased 4 per cent to Rs 330.52 crore during the period under review.

 However, the insurers operating income during the year dipped to Rs 213.38 crore from Rs 297.5 crore in the year before, because of higher motor and health claims pay-out. 

 The company had earned a premium of Rs 362 crore on third party vehicle policies last year and paid out Rs 609 crore towards claims.

 Either the motor third party tariff should be increased or insurance firms be freed to fix their own rates in this segment, otherwise insurers will continue to face losses in motor insurance, said R.G. Vishwanathan, financial advisor to Oriental Insurance Company.

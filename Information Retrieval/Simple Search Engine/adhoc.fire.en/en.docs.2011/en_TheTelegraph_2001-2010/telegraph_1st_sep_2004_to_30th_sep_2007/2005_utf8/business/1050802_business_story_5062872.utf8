 Lodha: In full control

 Calcutta, Aug. 1: While the legal battle over the control of the MP Birla group is moving from one courtroom to another, Rajendra Singh Lodha is consolidating his position in the group. 

 Birla Ericsson Optical Ltd today informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that its board has appointed R.S. Lodha as a director and chairman of the company at its meeting held on July 25. 

 Part of the MP Birla group, the company has entered into the field of manufacturing fibre optic cables in technical and financial collaboration with Ericsson Cables AB of Sweden. 

 ?Lodha?s appointment as the chairman makes it clear that he is in full control of the affairs in all companies of the MP Birla group,? said an industry observer. Lodha is also the chairman of Birla Corporation, the group?s flagship. 

 The city-based chartered accountant is fighting a fierce legal battle with the Birla family over the assets of the business group. 

 According to Lodha, Priyamvada Birla made him the sole successor of the assets of the group, a claim that the country?s first business family is opposing in the court of law. 

 Reacting to Lodha?s appointment as a director and chairman of Birla Ericsson Optical, a Birla family confidant said: ?He (Lodha) was calling all the shots in the company as the board is full of his people. So, his appointment does not make any difference.? 

 But sources in the company linked Lodha?s joining the board to requests from the joint venture partners. ?He (Lodha) was not on the board as he preferred to stay away. But for the past one year, the Swedish collaborator has been persuading him to take charge of the company as its chairman,? said a company source. 

 This joint venture company is promoted by Universal Cables Ltd, a leader in the field of power cables, Vindhya Telelinks Ltd, one of the leading manufacturer of jelly filled telecom cables, and their associates. Total promoters holding in the company is around 66.66 per cent of which Indian promoters hold 35.05 per cent and Ericsson Cables has a 27.50 per cent stake. 

 Birla Corp move

 Birla Corporation has decided to step up the capacity of clinker production by 50 per cent at its plant in Satna. The board has given its in-principal approval to this. Following the expansion, the clinker production will go up to 9,600 tonne from the present level of 6,300 tonne a day.

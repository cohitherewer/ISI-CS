 Mumbai, Oct. 25: Deposit and lending rates are set to look up with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raising the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points in its mid-term review of the annual policy statement for 2005-06.

 These hikes may not come immediately, bankers said. However, they added that deposit rates will be the first to go up. Here, a 25-basis-point increase in select maturity buckets, particularly at the shorter-end, is projected. 

 On the lending side, bankers feel interest rates on housing, personal and car loans are likely to be raised by some banks, while most do not expect the rise to come through due to the ongoing festival season.

 Reacting to the monetary policy, which also raised the repo rate by an equal 25 basis points, K.V. Kamath, managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank, said the bank would review deposit as well as lending rates in future.

 Stating that the policy statement is a balanced analysis of the current economic scenario, Kamath said the RBI has rightly struck a note of caution so that unchecked optimism does not result in a slackening of the rigour essential for decision making regarding credit and investment.

 Speaking to The Telegraph, Dena Bank chairman and managing director M.V. Nair averred that a rise in deposit rates in certain maturity buckets, particularly on the shorter end, is likely as a result of the 25 basis point hike in reverse repo and the repo rate. While Nair was circumspect on the issue of lending rates going up, he pointed out that any decision on raising deposit rates will be taken by the banks asset liability committee.

 Bhaskar Ghose, managing director of IndusInd Bank, said the measures announced by the RBI today and the hawkish statements made by the RBI governor on inflation suggested a rising interest rate regime in the near future.

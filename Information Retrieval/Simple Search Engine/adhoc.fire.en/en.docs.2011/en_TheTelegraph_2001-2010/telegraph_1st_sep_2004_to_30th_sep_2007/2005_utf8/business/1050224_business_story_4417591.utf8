 Bank of Punjab in share deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 23: A clutch of investors led by Canada?s The Bank of Nova Scotia and Bharti Enterprises picked up an 18.78 per cent stake in Bank of Punjab for a consideration of Rs 92.28 crore. The shares were sold in a preferential allotment at a price of Rs 38 apiece.

 The Bank of Nova Scotia and Bharti snapped up 4.99 per cent (64.51 lakh shares) each in the bank?s post-issue paid-up capital by paying Rs 24.51 crore each. ICB Financial Group Holdings of Switzerland bought a similar stake.

 The investment by Nova Scotia did not come as a surprise to many in the industry. The Canadian financial major had long been planning to buy equity in an Indian bank. However, the entry of Bharti Enterprises, a holding firm of Sunil Mittal-led group, raised eyebrows 

 A Bharti official said the deal was merely a ?financial investment? made by Bharti Enterprises. Bharti Tele-Ventures, the telecom spearhead, had nothing to do with it. He pointed out that the group already has an array of diversified interests, including a slice of equity in TV Today. This piece of investment, initially at 10 per cent, dropped to 4 per cent after the media major come out with its initial public offering (IPO).

 Apart from The Bank of Nova Scotia, Bharti Enterprises and ICB Financial, close to 38.78 lakh shares ? 3 per cent of the post-issue paid-up share capital of the bank ? were issued to Jyotsna Sharma, the owner of B. N. Enterprises, an export house in Delhi.

 In addition to this, 10.52 lakh equity shares, constituting 0.814 per cent of the post-issue paid-up share capital of the bank, were given to V. N. Koura, a leading barrister who has had a long association with the bank.

 Bank of Punjab managing director C. R. Sharma said money raised from the issue would meet future capital requirements. On being asked about the possibility of a strategic sale, he said it was unlikely, at least in the near term. 

 The stake sale sent the Bank of Punjab stock soaring to Rs 44.40 in a 14 per cent increase over its previous close. The share opened at Rs 39.30 and peaked at Rs 46.15. Two block deals of over 10 lakh shares were reported.

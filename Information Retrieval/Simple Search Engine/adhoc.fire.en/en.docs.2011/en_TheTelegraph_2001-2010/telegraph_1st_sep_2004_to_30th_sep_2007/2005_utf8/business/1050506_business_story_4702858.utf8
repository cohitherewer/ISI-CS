 IBM wields job-cut axe to slash cost

 Trying times

 San Francisco, May 5 (Reuters): International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) said it would trim 13,000 jobs, representing 4 per cent of its work force, in a cost-saving move that targets Europe. 

 The worlds largest computer company said it would reduce bureaucracy and scale back in slower-growth countries, using global teams instead of single-company operations to deliver some services. One specific move would be to eliminate an unnecessary layer of pan-European management, it said.

 Bob Moffat, IBMs senior vice president of supply chain integration, however, declined to specify which countries or office locations were targeted for cutbacks, but said they would be concentrated in Europe.

 ?Are we rebalancing resources into higher-growth markets?? said Moffat, the executive in charge of the restructuring, ?Absolutely. As any business would so do.?

 The company said it planned to cut between 10,000 and 13,000 jobs starting in the second quarter, representing roughly 3 to 4 per cent of the work force at the end of 2004.

 Last month, IBM warned job cuts were forthcoming following a bombshell earnings shortfall as a consequence of disappointing profits and sales in Japan, Germany, France and Italy. IBM also failed to close some deals in March this year.

 ?The job cuts are a sign that IBM is trying to solve its own troubles, not a symptom of a wider slowdown in the technology sector,? said Mark Herskovitz, manager of Dreyfus Premier Technology Growth fund, which manages $2 billion in assets.

 The reductions, while substantial, are a far cry from the scale of job-cutting IBM underwent in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the company faced a crisis in its core mainframe computer business and cut its workforce by more than half. From a peak of 405,000 employees in 1985, the companys workforce bottomed at 219,000 in 1994, in repeated rounds of layoffs that devastated the economy of the Hudson River valley where many of IBMs operations were once concentrated.

 IBM, based in Armonk, New York, employed 329,000 staff worldwide in December 2004, the last time the company disclosed its total work-force figures. About 100,000 of those jobs were located in its European region.

 On Sunday, IBM completed the sale of its PC business to Lenovo Group Ltd. of China resulting in the transfer of another 10,000 IBM PC employees to Lenovos payroll.

 IBM spokesman John Bukovinsky said most of the Europe job cuts would be voluntary and that talks had begun with workers councils and other organisations on the timing. ?In Europe, we expect to reach most of the objectives through voluntary programmes,? Bukovinsky said.

 But Herskovitz questioned the companys ability to hit the goal. ?I dont know how they are going to get 10,000 people to quit,? he said.

 Moffat said the latest moves were part of a three-year push to shift IBM employees into high-growth businesses while consolidating redundant back-office operations in each country where IBM operates.

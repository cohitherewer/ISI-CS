 BSNL not to roam with rivals

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 7: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) today refused to provide network access to private mobile operators.

 Network access is essential if subscribers of AirTel and Reliance wish to ?roam? in BSNL?s network.

 When a mobile subscriber of a private operator travels to a place where there is no private network and only BSNL coverage, he cannot make or receive a call. This creates problems for mobile users travelling to remote parts of the country.

 Regulators worldwide do not interfere in the area of network access since they believe that the market mechanism should be allowed to work to promote competition.

 N. K. Mangla, BSNL?s director marketing and commercial, said, ?It is a business decision not to provide access to private operators. If subscribers of Delhi and Mumbai wish to roam in our network across the country, they can take a connection from Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd. We want people to buy BSNL connections for wider coverage throughout the country.?

 ?It is not a denial of service and we have the right to adopt a marketing mechanism that does not violate any rules,? said Mangla.

 A. K. Sinha, CMD of BSNL, said: ?This is purely a business case. We entered cellular telephony 5-6 years after private operators. They (private players) focused only on big markets, we went to smaller areas. Now, why should we give access to their customers??

 BSNL executives were categorical that they were not even thinking of offering network access for a fee from mobile subscribers. For instance, AirTel has effected a premium roaming charge for non-AirTel subscribers in Jammu and Kashmir. ?Roaming charges are determined by Trai and we will follow them,? said Sinha.

 The government-owned telecom company is bullish about the future for telecom services and will invest Rs 78,000 crore within the next three years to expand its mobile, basic and broadband operations across the country.

 Asked whether the access deficit charge (ADC) had buoyed the net profit of BSNL, Sinha said on the contrary the profitability of the state-owned telephony major had been hit due to the cut in the ADC. 

 Early this year, BSNL had pointed that the new ADC regime will result in a loss of Rs 1,254 crore annually. Accordingly, the company claimed that its net profit would be less by about Rs 208 crore during 2004-05 due to the new ADC regime that came into effect from February.

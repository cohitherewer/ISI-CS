 Calcutta, Oct. 5: Timex Watches Limited has embarked on a growth path with a two-pronged strategy ? enhancing retail distribution network and introducing new brands. It has earmarked an investment of Rs 13.5 crore for this.

 ?We expect these initiatives will fetch a 25 per cent cumulative annual growth in earnings for the next three years,? said V. D. Wadhwa, vice-president (sales), Timex Watches Limited.

 To begin with, the company will launch three new brands ? Nautica, Timberland and French Connection over the next six months from its international portfolio. The three brands are targeted at the premium segment and are priced in the range of Rs 4,000 to Rs 15,000. 

 ?We are witnessing a growing trend towards premium international watches and the contribution of these category of products to our sales has also grown from 12 per cent to 20 per cent,? Wadhwa explained.

 Along side launching newer brands, Timex is also planning to widen its retail distribution network by increasing the number of the company showrooms to 120 from 20 at present. 

 ?By December this year, we shall set up 15 new showrooms,? said Wadhwa. Besides, Timex will also increase its presence to 4,000 multi-brand outlets, up from the current 3,000 stores.

 Reeling in the red for the last five years, the watchmaker achieved a turnaround last fiscal with a profit of Rs 72 lakh. ?We expect to post a profit of Rs 3 crore for the current financial year and Rs 13 crore in 2007-08,? said Wadhwa. 

 ?The promoters of the company have also given their commitments to infuse fresh funds within the next one and a half months,? he added. Timex Watches is a group company of Timex Corporation USA held through Netherlands based Timex Watches BV.

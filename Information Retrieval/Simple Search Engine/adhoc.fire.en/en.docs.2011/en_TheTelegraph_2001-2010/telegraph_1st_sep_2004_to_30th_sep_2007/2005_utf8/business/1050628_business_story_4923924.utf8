 IOC on legal road to Haldia

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Its on the notice board

 Calcutta, June 27: Indian Oil Corporation has slapped a legal notice on Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) for failing to transfer shares worth Rs 150 crore already paid.

 The navratna oil company has also approached the department of company affairs (DCA) seeking a probe into the delay. Indian Oil (IOC) was supposed to get a 7.5 per cent stake in HPL against its February 18 payment of Rs 150 crore. The cheque has not been encashed so far, even though the HPL board had approved IOCs entry with a minority shareholding. 

 Sources said the DCA office in Delhi has asked its counterpart in Calcutta to probe the matter. Petroleum ministry sources said Indian Oil has sent two legal notices. 

 The first went in April and the second one was sent recently. Neither the company nor the promoters have got back to IOC. The top brass of IOC is extremely irked over the issue. HPL should spell out whether they want to give shares to IOC or not. This unnecessary delay is uncalled for, senior officials of the petroleum ministry added.

 Union petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar had made a personal effort to see that Indian Oil invests in HPL.

 I am not aware of a notice. If it has come, we will take up the matter with other shareholders and see what can be done, Bengal industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen told The Telegraph.

 Sen maintained that IOCs entry is being considered. Both the principal promoters will take a decision on the matter.

 The promoters had invited IOC on January 28 to join HPL as a shareholder. The oil PSU agreed and, in the third week of February, sent a letter along with the cheque. 

 HPL officials refused to comment on the issue since the promoters are still to decide.

 IOCs entry has been put on hold as Purnendu Chatterjee of The Chatterjee Group is opposed to the idea of allowing IOC to become a partner in the Rs 5,170-crore petrochem company. Purnendu was not available for comment.

 The TCG boss is keen to buy out the Bengal governments stake in HPL. If that happens, it will shut out IOC.

 However, Purnendu is yet to spell out to the Bengal government when he will bring in the required funds to acquire the 36.87 per cent stake.

 That is the reason why the TCG chief is not getting back to Indian Oil on the issue, industry sources said.

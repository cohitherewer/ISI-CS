 Court spoils Orissa mood

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, Dec. 5: The Orissa government?s move to dig more cash out of mining suffered a jolt today when the high court struck down the Orissa Rural Infrastructure Socio-economic Development Act, dubbing it unconstitutional.

 The act, which came into effect on May 30 this year, aimed at collecting mining cess on different minerals, ranging between 5 per cent and 20 per cent. 

 According to the notification, a 20 per cent cess was to be levied on bauxite and 15 per cent on coal, iron ore, chromite and manganese ore. Besides, a 10 per cent cess was to be collected from dolomite and limestone and 5 per cent from china clay, philite, gemstone, decorative stones, stretite and other minerals.

 ?The enactment of regulations of mines and mineral development has been taken away by the Union government from the state legislature. The state legislature is incompetent to enact the same act,? said the division bench comprising Chief Justice Sujit Burman Roy and Justice M.M. Das in their 107-page order. 

 The bench passed the judgment on some writ applications, including one filed by Nalco, challenging the competency of the Orissa government to pass such legislation. The petitioners included Nalco, Mahanadi Coalfields Limited, Eastern Zonal Mining Association, Kataunarbheram, TB Lal and Kay Pee Enterprises. 

 The court has also directed the government to return the cess it collected from some of the companies.

 Orissa mines minister Padmanabha Behera said his government would challenge the order in the Supreme Court.

 The petitioners contended that the cess imposed under the act on mining of major minerals in the state amounted to double taxation as the mine owners were subjected to a levy by the Union government. 

 If the law stood judicial scrutiny, neighbouring states like Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh may have enacted similar legislation to augment their local taxes. This is not the first attempt by the state government to levy local tax on mineral production. Previous enactment of the Orissa Cess Act, 1962 and the Orissa Rural Employment, Education and Production Act, 1992 were challenged and held by the courts as void.

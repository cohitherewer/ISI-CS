 Cartel not to trim crude output

 Kuwait, Nov. 28 (Reuters): Opecs Kuwaiti president said on Sunday there was no need for the cartel to cut production when it meets next month and described oil prices as reasonable.

 The oil minister of United Arab Emirates, however, said the cartel, which meets in Kuwait on December 12, may consider rolling over a 2 million barrels per day (BPD) offer of spare capacity if markets needed it.

 Opec president Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahd al-Sabah, who is also Kuwaits energy minister, dismissed speculation about a production cut, echoing comments from Saudi Arabia, the worlds top oil exporter.

 I, as Kuwaits (energy minister,) think there is no need for decreasing production. We are helping to stabilise the market and prices; therefore, there is no need for a cut at this moment, Sheikh Ahmad said.

 On Saturday, Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi said Opec oil exporters were not thinking of cutting production levels at the meeting despite a recent fall in world oil prices.

 Sheikh Ahmad said he thought oil prices were at reasonable levels and that the cartel would work to ensure that they remained so.

 I think the prices are still at a very good and reasonable (level) now, he said.

 We hope the prices will be reasonable for everybody. This is what we were doing all last year, trying to bring prices to a normal situation. Opec will continue with the same practices and behaviours as last year just to make sure that prices will continue ... (to be) reasonable, he said.

 London Brent crude oil drifted lower on Friday, extending the previous sessions deep slide as healthy fuel stocks took the sting out of cold weather. Brent settled 29 cents lower at $55.01 a barrel after closing down $1 on Thursday.

 Activity was limited as the US market was closed for the second day of the Thanksgiving holiday and the Brent market closed early. US crude futures settled at $58.71 on Wednesday, around $12 below the all-time high of $70.85 struck at the end of August.

 To try to calm prices as they hit record highs, Opec agreed in September to offer its spare output capacity, the lions share of which is held by Saudi Arabia. The oil was on offer from October 1 for three months, but ministers have said there were no takers.

 UAE oil minister Mohammed bin Dhaen al-Hamli said the offer could be renewed. If the market needs it we will offer it, I am sure.

 Sheikh Ahmad said it was too early to decide the issue.

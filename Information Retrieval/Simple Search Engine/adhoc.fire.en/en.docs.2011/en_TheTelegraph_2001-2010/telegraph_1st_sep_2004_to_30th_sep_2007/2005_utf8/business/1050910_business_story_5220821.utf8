 Stocks take a break, caution is buzzword

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 9: Stocks paused for breath today after propelling the sensex past the 8000-mark on Thursday.

 The fag end of trading saw some selling in index heavyweights. Foreign brokerages revised their estimates of the sensex downwards, even as they acknowledged the strength of the Indian markets. 

 The market breadth was negative with losers outnumbering gainers by a ratio of 3 losers to one gainer. The sensex, however, managed to close with a gain of 7.45 points at 8060.01. Earlier in the day, the sensex hit a new high of 8077.74 on buying support. The intra-day low was 8015.75. 

 The nifty ended with a gain of a point at 2455.45. Even as the barometers are at life-time highs, many brokerages have advised caution. A research report by JM Morgan Stanley conveys the latent misgivings of foreign investors. 

 While the markets P/E seems below historical highs, it has to be seen in the context of a global average P/E, which is at multi-year lows. The markets relative P/E to the world is above one and at an all-time high, possibly discounting Indias superior earnings growth, it said.

 Investors are a bit cautious on India. However, this is driven by the strong trailing price performance rather than doubt over its fundamentals... The recent story is more cyclical than structural. What we have witnessed over the past two years is a reflection of the emerging market story driven by high risk appetite with one key difference ? India has chosen consumption over investment, which puts a question mark over the sustainability of the recent cycle. Moreover, policy response continues to be feeble and expectations are high.

 Calcutta, Oct. 20: The new export promotion scheme drafted by the ministry of commerce will help exporters get refund of electricity duty, sales tax on petroleum products and central sales tax.

 The WTO-compatible scheme is being discussed between the commerce ministry and its finance counterpart before it goes to the cabinet for approval. It is likely to be introduced before December 31, when the deadline for the duty entitlement passbook (DEPB) scheme expires.

 Henceforth, exporters will enjoy the facilities of both the duty drawback scheme and the new export promotion scheme. Earlier, it was a choice between the DEPB and the duty drawback schemes.

 Under the duty drawback plan, exporters are entitled to get refund of the excise and customs duty.

 Elaborating the salient features of the new export promotion scheme, Capexil chairman Samir Kumar Ghosh said, Exporters will get refund of the electricity duty on power sold to an exporting unit. They will also get refund of the sales tax on petroleum products and central sales tax on products that have inter-state movements.

 Capexil expects the scheme to give a fillip to exports and facilitate exporters in a big way.

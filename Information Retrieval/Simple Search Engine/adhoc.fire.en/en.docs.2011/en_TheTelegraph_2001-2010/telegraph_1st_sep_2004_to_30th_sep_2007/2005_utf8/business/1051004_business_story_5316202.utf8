 Calcutta, Oct. 3: New York Life International expects India to become its biggest market outside the US in the next 5 to 6 years surpassing Mexico.

 At present, we have the largest operations in Mexico where we entered into a major acquisition deal recently. However, we expect India to become our largest market considering the potential of life insurance market vis-a-vis the rate of growth being witnessed here, said Joseph A. Gilmour, president and chief executive officer, New York Life International.

 Gilmour explained that Mexico has a higher insurance penetration compared with India. Though India is growing at a higher rate than Maxico, the insurance penetration here is low, he said.

 At present, the Asian region contributes two-thirds of New York Lifes global business while the rest comes from Latin American countries. 

 Over the next 2-3 years, we expect the Asian region to contribute over 80 per cent of our total business, registering a growth of almost 15-20 per cent per annum, mentioned Gilmour.

 New York Life International is the global business arm of New York Life Insurance Company, the second largest insurer in the US, and it operates in nine countries. 

 We have recently got license to get into insurance business in Vietnam. We also plan to expand out presence in Latin America and enter into Brazil, Gilmour revealed.

 New York Life International contributes 24 per cent of the total business of the US-based New York Life Insurance Company. We expect the contribution to go up to 35 per cent over the next five years, overtaking the growth in the US business, said Gilmour.

 New York Life is amongst the few insurance companies in the US which is growing at faster rate than the market. While the US insurance market is growing at 3-5 per cent annually, the insurer is growing at 9-12 per cent.

 Max New York Life, the Indian arm of New York Life International, is a joint venture with Max India Limited. Once the FDI limits are raised for the insurance sector, we will increase our stake in the Indian outfit, said Gary Bennett, managing director and chief executive officer, Max New York Life.

 We are the third largest private life insurance company here in terms of customer base and are looking at the long-term growth, mentioned Bennett.

 Stocks close at new peak

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 18: Buoyant FII inflows and robust first-quarter results from a large swathe of India Inc drove up the BSE sensex to its highest-ever close at 7347.10 today.

 Foreign funds, having invested more than Rs 1,269 crore in equity in the first four days of last week, stepped up their purchases of blue-chip shares. They have already sloshed Rs 23,000 crore in this calendar year.

 TCS, which logged better-than-expected first-quarter numbers over the weekend, set the tone for the rally, which saw the 30-share index open at 7325.65 and hit a high of 7359.81. Its close at 7347.10 showed a gain of 1.04 per cent. On July 12, the sensex tested 7352.46, the highest so far. 

 The BSE-100 index shot up 43.22 points to 3932.01. The BSE-200 and the dollex-200 were quoted higher at 952.14 and 364.08 at close compared with the weekends close of 942.22 and 360.45, respectively. The BSE-500 index inched up 35.08 points to 3046.81 from its previous close of 3011.73. The dollex-30 ended higher at 1385.39 from 1371.77. 

 The spurt in indices has been fuelled by heavy rainfall, which boosts farm output and fuels consumer spending. 

 The volume of business on Dalal Street jumped to Rs 3594.57 crore from Rs 3078.57 crore on Friday. In all, 150 stocks, including 23 from the sensex, clocked gains; only a small fraction, a total of 46 shares, ended as losers.

 TCS surged Rs 72.80 to Rs 1321, Infosys Tech Rs 76.90 to Rs 2272.30, Satyam Rs 15.75 to Rs 496.65, Reliance Energy Rs 23.60 to Rs 656.55 and Tata Steel Rs 5.90 to Rs 362.85.

 Rupee weaker 

 The rupee closed at 43.55 against the dollar, down 3 paise from Fridays finish of 43.52, as surging crude prices and a resurgent dollar overseas fuelled demand for greenbacks.

 Jet fuel cheaper, not tickets

 New Delhi, Nov. 2: National oil companies today cut jet fuel prices by up to Rs 745 per kilolitre, or 1.85 per cent, bringing it in sync with falling international rates. There was, however, no word from senior government officials on whether the reduction will be extended to petrol and diesel.

 While airlines will pay less for fuel, there are few indications that the cost savings would be passed on to passengers through lower ticket prices.

 A SpiceJet spokesperson said the reduction would not impact air fares because in terms of operational costs, cheaper oil means a difference of only 0.4 per cent. Airlines could consider fare cuts if jet fuel prices come down further.

 On petrol and diesel, the officials said the last two rounds of increases have not covered the shortfall between global and domestic prices and hence, there is no question of reducing petro-product prices at this point of time. 

 They said the two fuels are being sold now at Rs 2.70 and Rs 3.25 per litre less than what they cost in the global market.

 Oil companies in the country have been long complaining that they are bleeding because of lower domestic prices and will lobby the government against any drop in domestic prices of petro-products. 

 For instance, Indian Oil Corporations net profit for the first six months of this fiscal works out to Rs 895 crore, which is much lower than the corresponding figure of Rs 2,712 crore last year. Under-recoveries on account of petrol, diesel, cooking gas and kerosene for IOC during the period increased to Rs 5,627 crore compared with Rs 3,867 crore in the year-ago period. 

 Jet fuel is being treated as a one off case. For international airlines, who do not have to pay local levies on the fuel, the cut would be between $25-26 a kl. 

 Oil prices have been falling and are now below $60 as warm weather reduced European and American demands for heating oil. Recent forecasts by the US Energy Information Administration show fuel demand in the worlds largest energy consumer nation is lagging by more than 2 per cent compared with last year. 

 However, oil ministry officials said the strife in West Asia and blazing growth in China have also fuelled the spurt.

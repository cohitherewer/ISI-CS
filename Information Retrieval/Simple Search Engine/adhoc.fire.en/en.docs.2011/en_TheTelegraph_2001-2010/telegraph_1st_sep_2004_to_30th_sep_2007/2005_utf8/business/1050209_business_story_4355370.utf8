 Riggs-PNC merger talks hit deadlock over price

 TERENCE HARA

 Washington, Feb. 8: Riggs National Corp?s $766-million merger with PNC Financial Services Group Inc fell apart over the weekend as the two sides could not come to terms on a new, lower price for Riggs. Riggs filed suit against PNC on Monday morning in an effort to enforce the deal. 

 In July, PNC agreed to pay cash and stock worth about $24.25 a share for Riggs. But Riggs? recent guilty plea for failing to take anti-money laundering measures, a $16-million criminal fine and the potential for further civil penalties against the bank and its officers and directors led PNC to lower the price per share that it was willing to pay, said sources familiar with the negotiations. 

 PNC also cited the tens of millions of dollars in lawyers fees that Riggs has incurred in recent months, as well as the possibility the $16-million criminal fine Riggs agreed to with the department of justice could be bumped up by a federal judge who has yet to approve the fine. 

 But the Washington bank was unwilling to accept a price far below Riggs? current market value. Riggs, in a statement issued on Monday morning, said its board unanimously rejected PNC?s latest offer. 

 Riggs said PNC had offered approximately $19.32 per share as ?upfront? consideration, but that amount would remain subject to further downward adjustment if circumstances changed. 

 Separately, PNC also offered Riggs a ?contingent security? that could eventually add as much as 83 cents to the price of each share, pending the outcome of various civil matters. 

 PNC had demanded Riggs settle at least one private litigation before the deal is done and set aside reserves to cover others. But Riggs said it believes those lawsuits, which include shareholder lawsuits and a claim filed by the survivors of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, are without merit and shouldn?t be reserved against. Neither PNC nor Riggs would specify which lawsuit PNC wanted to see settled before the deal was completed. 

 Riggs stock opened Monday at $21.06, but Riggs officials asked the Nasdaq stock exchange to halt trading at about 10:30 a.m. Eastern time pending an announcement about the merger. Riggs stock resumed trading shortly after noon at about $20.20 a share, on heavy volume. 

 The merger agreement with Pittsburgh-based PNC allows PNC to back out of the deal without penalty should a material change occur in Riggs regulatory or financial position. But Riggs suit Monday seeks to force PNC to either honor the original agreement or pay damages to Riggs. 

 Riggs officials last week remained guardedly optimistic a deal could still be struck. But PNCs position remained firm, and it was unwilling to pay above $20 a share, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 

 quot;PNC knew that its revised terms and conditions would be unacceptable to Riggs, quot; said Riggs in a statement. quot;In addition to the price, we are particularly disturbed by PNCs new insistence that Riggs settle or reserve against private litigation as a condition of closing, even though we believe these claims are without merit. quot; 

 Riggs executives and directors had worked for months to clear the way for the deal by negotiating a guilty plea with the Department of Justice over the banks failure to file required reports on suspicious transactions involving two former clients, former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet and the West African country of Equatorial Guinea. The plea was considered essential to PNCs going through with the merger. 

 Pending the outcome of its legal action against PNC, Riggs said it will entertain other offers for the company. 

 Riggs also said Monday that it lost about $60 million in the fourth quarter. In all of 2004, the loss is expected to total about $100 million. The fourth-quarter results included $20 million in expenses associated with the criminal settlement. The bank also set aside $8 million in reserves to cover the costs of civil litigation.

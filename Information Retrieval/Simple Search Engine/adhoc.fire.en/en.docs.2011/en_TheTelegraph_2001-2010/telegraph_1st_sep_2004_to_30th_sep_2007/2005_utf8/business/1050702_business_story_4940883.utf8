 Labour pains hobble Honda 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 1: Honda Motorcycles and Scooter India, the Japanese company that set up shop here after striking an initial no-competition deal with its local partner Hero Honda, is facing a crisis.

 Its plant at Manesar in Haryana has partially shut down because of labour unrest, leading to a loss of over Rs 100 crore.

 Since May, the employees of Honda Motorcycles have gone on strike, demanding higher wages.

 Honda and many other Japanese and European automobile manufacturers were drawn to India because of its booming consumer demand and cheap labour.

 Sources say the unrest has led to a sharp slowdown in Hondas production schedule.

 Scooter and motorcycle production at the plant has gone down from about 2,000 units a day to just about 250.

 The two-wheeler major sold 62,000 units (both scooters and motorcycles) in April. This came down to 57,000 units in May. Officials have estimated that the total sales in June will not cross 34,000 units.

 There are some local miscreants who have joined hands with the trade union for their vested interests. Besides causing great damage to machinery, they are threatening workers who are willing to work, a senior official said.

 These local people are luring them with promises of higher wages. But we hope to sort out the matter before the month-end, he added.

 The management will now take the workers, who intend to cause any damage to the company, to task, sources said. The factory has 2,500 employees.

 Refusing to re-induct suspended workers pending an inquiry, the management has asked others who have joined them to return to work after signing an undertaking that they would maintain the discipline of the company and ensure normal production at all times.

 Since the problem started, the company has suspended 25 line associates and dismissed five others. Nearly 250 workers have shunned work and are protesting outside the plant.

 Officials said earlier this year, the company had given a 30 per cent raise to the employees across the board.

 The administration has swung into action, trying to broker peace between the two factions.

 Gurgaon SSP Yogendra Nehra said the situation was under control and 30 policemen have been stationed outside the plant.

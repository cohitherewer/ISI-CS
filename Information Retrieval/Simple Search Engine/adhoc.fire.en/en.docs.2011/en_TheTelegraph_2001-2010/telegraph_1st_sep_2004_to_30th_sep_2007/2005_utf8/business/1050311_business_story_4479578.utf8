 Unions target loan defaulters

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, March 10: Bank trade unions, led by Left front leader Gurudas Dasgupta, want finance minister P. Chidambaram to bring in legal changes to allow banks to easily attach property owned by loan defaulting firms and their promoters.

 Last year, the apex court order had struck down a provision in the Sarfaesi Act that required defaulters to deposit 75 per cent of the outstanding dues before seeking legal redress.

 Although the Congress-led government has promised to bring in a legislation that mandates an alternative quicker attachment process, it has not yet done so. 

 Dasgupta said here today that the over Rs 96,000-crore bad loans of the state-run banks could be wiped out easily if the government cracked down on the defaulters.

 Malvika Steel led the list of defaulting companies with an outstanding amount of Rs 1,227 crore as on March 31, 2004. Others who figured prominently on the list included DCM Ltd, Lloyds Steel and Usha Ispat.

 Vinay Rai, the promoter of Malvika Steel, could not be contacted for comment. DCMs Vinay Bharat Ram said, ?I think it must be a misunderstanding .... I cannot comment on this.? 

 Dasgupta claimed that if the money already written off as well as accrued interests is taken into consideration, then the total non-performing assets of the banks would stand at Rs 300,000 crore. 

 He, accompanied by the leaders of All India Bank Employees? Association, demanded criminal action, confiscation of properties and blacklisting of the defaulters.

 ?The government has so far refused to make the list of defaulters public,? he said. ?We have made the list public in discharge of our national duty because it (NPA) amounts to an attempt to dismantle our public banking system. NPA constitutes a loot of national exchequer. If banks are looted, the people are looted,? he said.

 He said many of the bad loans run up by huge industrial groups had been written off, scaling down the profitability of PSU banks. In 2003-04 alone, some Rs 14,353 crore had been written off reducing profit margins by 36 per cent.

 Ericsson in talks to acquire Marconi

 London, Oct. 10 (Reuters): Swedish telecom equipment maker Ericsson is in talks to buy UK rival Marconi and a deal could be announced within weeks, people familiar with the negotiations said today. 

 The Financial Mail newspaper said in an unsourced report that Ericsson saw a total valuation for Marconi of up to ?1.3 billion ($2.31 billion), roughly twice its current market value. 

 Marconi, which nearly collapsed in the 2001 telecom industry meltdown, declined to comment. 

 In Stockholm, a spokeswoman for Ericsson said the group never commented on rumours and speculation.

 Marconi received a major blow in April after BT Group cut the group out of its ?10-billion network upgrade plan. It has since announced plans to cut 800 jobs and promised to look at all of its strategic options. 

 The possible deal comes amid a flurry of activity in the telecom sector as chief executives get back into buying mode after years of restructuring. 

 Last week, British cable operator NTL agreed to a long-awaited deal to buy smaller rival Telewest for $6 billion. 

 In July, France Telecom grabbed control of Amena in a deal valuing Spains third-ranked mobile phone group at 10.6 billion euros ($12.9 billion). 

 The Financial Mail said the possible Ericsson-Marconi deal was put together with investment banks Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan and Lazard advising Marconi, while Enskilda acted for Ericsson. 

 A report in the Observer newspaper said British parliamentarians were demanding that the government intervene in a possible bid for Marconi by Chinas Huawei Technologies, because of concerns the company was too closely associated with the Chinese government. 

 Ericsson has said its acquisition strategy would involve buying small to medium-sized companies worth between $200 million to $700 million that would be add-ons to its existing business rather than bigger deals. 

 Newspaper reports have earlier linked Ericsson, as well as Siemens and Alcatel, with Marconi.

 Calcutta, March 9: Tata Tea today announced the closure of the refinance of the entire outstanding debt in Tata Tea (GB) Ltd, a special purpose vehicle that holds 100 per cent equity of the Tetley Group, UK.

 The exercise will help Tetley save Rs 23 crore interest per annum. This will also help the company to achieve a debt-equity ratio of 1.6:1.

 Tata Tea had acquired Tetley for ?271 million in February 2000 as part of its strategy to become a global player in the tea business.

 As a result of this move, the residual debt outstanding as on February 4, 2005, from the first refinance that was concluded in February 2003 has been fully paid off and replaced by a fresh debt, which is more cost effective. The loan has been jointly arranged by Rabo Bank India and Rabo Bank International, London, with the latter underwriting the facility.

 The debt retired had initially aggregated to ?184 million (Rs 1527 crore), the weighted average interest of which approximated to 2.95 per cent per annum plus Libor. The refinanced debt of Tata Tea (GB) now concluded is for ?160 million (Rs 1328 crore) at an average interest margin of 1.40 per cent per annum plus Libor.

 Tata Tea managing director Percy Siganporia said, ?The savings on account of this refinance will be used in organic growth of the company. The market will witness new offerings in the green and special tea segment from the Tetley stable. The company will also make foray into emerging markets.?

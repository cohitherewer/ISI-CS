 Tropical to sell stake

 VIVEK NAIR 

 Mumbai, Jan. 11: Tropical Clothing Company Pte Ltd, promoters of khadi fashion brand Khadder, is all set to sell part of its shareholding to private investors. This is to part-finance a Rs 18-crore expansion programme to set up India Lifestyle stores at home and abroad.

 The company plans to set up six large format stores in the country with a retail space of 6,000-8,000 sq ft each. Besides Khadder, these stores plan to keep home furnishings, wood and alternative handmade products, and organic food items under different brand names. 

 Tropical Clothing has five stores in Calcutta, Bangalore, Chandigarh, Pondicherry and Lucknow. The cities identified for India Lifestyle stores include Calcutta, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai. The company is also evaluating the possibility of venturing abroad to London, Hong Kong/Singapore and Dubai.

 Tropical Clothing, the first organised retail-driven khadi company, was founded in 2001 by Arup Datta and Rahul Upadhyay. 

 Speaking to The Telegraph, Datta, co-founder, Tropical Clothing, said, ?Against the current turnover of over Rs 2 crore, the expansion plan is likely to yield a topline of Rs 80 crore. We plan to come out with an initial public offering (IPO) as well after seven years.?

 Datta, who said the promoters would remain the majority shareholders after roping in private investors, hinted that close to 25 per cent may be hawked off to the latter. 

 He, however, added that the company was not looking at venture capital funding and that the objective was to enlist a strategic partner would also give critical inputs. ?In the past three years, we have grown at a rate of 300 per cent. We will try and continue growing 100 per cent annually for the next few years,? he added.

 While the focus of Tropical Clothing has been on price, comfort and availability, the company is also evaluating new methods to retain customer loyalty.

 ?It is observed that footfalls are usually low around noon. We are now looking at a happy-hour pricing, whereby we may offer those stocks that do not move at an attractive price,? Datta said.

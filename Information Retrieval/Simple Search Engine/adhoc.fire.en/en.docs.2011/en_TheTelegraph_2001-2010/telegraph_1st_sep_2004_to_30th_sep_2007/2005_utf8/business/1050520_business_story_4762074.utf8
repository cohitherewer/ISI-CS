 RIL fibre research centre

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 19: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has set up a state-of-the-art centre at Patalganga near Mumbai to conduct research on polyester fibre and spun yarn with an investment of around $3 million.

 Reliance has joined hands with Rieter Machine Works of Switzerland, a leading maker of textile spinning machinery, to help the downstream textile industry.

 While the Reliance Fibre Application Centre is equipped with Rieter machines to test fibre applications, customers will benefit from new speciality man-made fibres from Reliance.

 This facility takes Reliance one step nearer to the customer and reduces the development cycle time by providing quality yarn samples that are tested at the application centre. This will improve the operational efficiency of downstream textile industry to develop value-added products at the shortest possible time, RIL added.

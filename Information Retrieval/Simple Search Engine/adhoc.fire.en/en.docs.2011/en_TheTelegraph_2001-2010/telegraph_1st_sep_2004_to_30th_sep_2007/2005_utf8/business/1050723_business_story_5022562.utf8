 Calcutta, July 22: Balrampur Chini Mills will set up a greenfield integrated sugar complex at an estimated cost of Rs 300 crore.

 The complex will be set up at Datauli, Mankapur in eastern Uttar Pradesh. It will have a 7000-tonne-crushed-per-day (tcd) sugar plant, a 23-mw power unit and a 60-klpd distillery. The complex will be commissioned by November 2006.

 Of the Rs 113.08 crore garnered from private placement made during the year, Rs 79.43 crore has been utilised for the companys ongoing sugar complex at Akbarpur in eastern Uttar Pradesh, which will be commissioned by November 2005. The balance amount will be used for the new project, Balrampur Chini Mills managing director Vivek Saraogi said at the annual general meeting of the company here today.

 The company has also increased its borrowing capacity from the earlier Rs 500 crore to Rs 1,000 crore. However, the board will decide on financing the remaining amount for the new complex, said Saraogi.

 The company is also expanding capacities at its four manufacturing locations ? Balrampur, Babhnan, Tulsipur and Haidergarh ? by 1000 tcd at each unit.

 The Akbarpur plant, at an investment of Rs 200 crore, is an integrated complex for manufacturing sugar (7,000 tcd) and co-generation of power (11 mw) through bagasse.

 By November 2006, the sugar capacity will rise to 47,000 tcd, distillery operations are likely to be at 220 klpd and the power generating capacity will total 100.80 mw.

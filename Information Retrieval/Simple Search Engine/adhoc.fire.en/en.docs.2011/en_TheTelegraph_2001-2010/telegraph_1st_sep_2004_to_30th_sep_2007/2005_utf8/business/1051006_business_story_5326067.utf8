 New Delhi, Oct. 5: AirTels BlackBerry service can be accessed in other mobile phones. It is now free from the proprietary handset that was bundled with the service.

 BlackBerry email delivery is based on a push-based system. It displays emails similar to short message services on mobile phones, which the user can view on the handset. The service also offers other intelligent features like wireless email synchronisation and view attachments. 

 AirTel and Research In Motion today announced plans to offer more services with push-based BlackBerry email services. 

 The BlackBerry Connect wireless services can be accessed through Nokia 9500 Communicator, Nokia 9300 smart phone and Sony Ericsson P910i. 

 The Nokia 9300 smart phone is available in India for Rs 29,000, while the Nokia 9500 Communicator is priced at Rs 34,500. The Sony Ericsson P910i is available at Rs 27,995.

 AirTels BlackBerry portfolio also includes the BlackBerry 7100g and BlackBerry 7290. 

 Email continues to be a key communication medium and research indicates that the first application most mobile users like to see integrated into their mobile phones is email, said Manoj Kohli, president Mobility, Bharti Tele-Ventures Ltd.

 Emails also have one of the greatest impacts on productivity. The expansion of BlackBerry service to a much wider range of new and stylish handsets allow us to address the needs of a broader user base, thereby, further catalysing the adoption and usage of this service in India, he added.

 Norm Lo, vice-president, Asia-Pacific at Research In Motion, said, Millions of mobile professionals around the world are using the BlackBerry platform to stay connected to people and information throughout the day.

 New Delhi, Dec. 13: Honda Siel Cars India, a subsidiary of the Japan-based Honda, will invest Rs 700 crore in the next five years to ramp up its capacity and introduce new models.

 The money will be used to roll out new models and increase capacity from 50,000 to 1 lakh units, Honda Siel president and CEO Masahiro Takedagawa said at the companys manufacturing facility at Greater Noida in Uttar Pradesh.

 The company has already invested close to Rs 150 crore to ramp up capacity to 50,000 cars per annum from 30,000. It plans to double the output to 1,00,000 units by 2010.

 The capacity hike will create nearly 2,000 additional jobs in this factory.

 The improved facility includes a new weld shop with robotic machinery, increased engine assembly unit, a separate door assembly area and a spare parts warehouse.

 Honda officials said good performance of the three Honda models ? the City, the Accord and the CRV ? in India has necessitated an increase in capacity.

 Honda holds a 99 per cent stake in Honda Siel, while local partner Siel India owns the rest.

 Takedagawa said internal accruals will fund the new investments. The company has so far invested close to Rs 800 crore in India.

 According to Takedagawa, the Civic will hit the Indian roads probably in the first half of 2006.

 We are working on the launch of the Civic in India and hope to introduce it in 2006, he said, adding it would initially produce about 10,000 units annually.

 This will be more or less on the lines of Toyotas Corolla, which sells a similar number of units in the US market.

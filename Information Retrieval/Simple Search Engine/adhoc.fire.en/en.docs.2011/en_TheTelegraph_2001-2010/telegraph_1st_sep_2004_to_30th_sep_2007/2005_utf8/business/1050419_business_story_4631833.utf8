 Calcutta, April 18: Oracle plans to lead the enterprise software market in the next few years.

 The company has already bagged the top position in the human capital management and supply chain management segments.

 ?We have over 23,000 customers in the applications segment and over 3,500 in Asia Pacific,? said Samik Nandi, director, business development, Oracle India. ?We will continue with the product line-up of PeopleSoft and JD Edwards and will launch co-branded items next year. We plan to maintain the product development schedule of PeopleSoft and JD Edwards till 2013.?

 The three enterprise application products lined up for 2006 are Oracle PeopleSoft Enterprise Release 9, Oracle JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Release 8.12 and Oracle E-Business Suite 11i. 

 Oracle had acquired PeopleSoft last December for $10.3 billion.

 Nandi also said the small and medium enterprise (SME) segment, with a turnover between Rs 50 crore and Rs 100 crore, provided a growing business opportunity in India with its increased focus on implementing IT for office applications.

 India is the fifth largest market for Oracle in terms of revenue.

 ?The idea is to build a common data model for all business processes that will support many languages and currencies,? he added. ?The applications will also keep in mind the local requirements of each region.?

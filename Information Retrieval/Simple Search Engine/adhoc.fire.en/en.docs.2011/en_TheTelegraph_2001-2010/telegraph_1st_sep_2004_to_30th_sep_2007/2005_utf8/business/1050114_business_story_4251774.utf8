 New Delhi, Jan. 13: Czech auto major Skoda plans to turn its plant at Aurangabad into a manufacturing hub for the south Asian region.

 Skoda, which entered India four years back, will commence exports from this year.

 ?Skoda will start exporting from the first part of this year. Exports will begin with the smaller neighbouring Asian countries,? said Imran Hassen, managing director of Skoda Auto India.

 Exports will start with countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal. Hassen said the company is going through the legislation procedures required to export to these countries.

 He also said Skoda will increase its auto component sourcing from India. 

 Skoda has set itself the target of selling 13,200 cars in the year 2005. Since the start of its Indian operations, Skoda has so far sold 16,500 cars in the country.

 Skoda, which plans to launch the much-awaited Fabia and Octavia II, proposes to double its production capacity this year from 15,000 units, Hassen said.

 A new version of the Skoda Rider, launched today, has a 1.8 turbo petrol engine, which the company claims will make it the quickest car on the road. It accelerates from zero to 100 kmph in 8.4 seconds and is priced at Rs 11.03 lakh.

 Last year, Skoda had launched the Octavia Rider, which was a diesel car and did not have a turbo engine. At present, the price of both these cars will be the same, said a company spokesperson.

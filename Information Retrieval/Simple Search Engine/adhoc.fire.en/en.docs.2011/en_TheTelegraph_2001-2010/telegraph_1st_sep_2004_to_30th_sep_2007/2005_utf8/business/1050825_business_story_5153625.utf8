 Calcutta, Aug. 24: Hero Honda plans to invest Rs 100-300 crore in its third two-wheeler plant.

 The company has two plants in Haryana, which can manufacture three million units annually. 

 We will make an announcement about the new unit soon. The company is zeroing in on the possible locations for it, Atul Sobti, executive director (business operations), said here today.

 The company is working out the size and configuration of the plant and will invest accordingly.

 Hero Honda intends to finance the expansion plan through internal accruals.

 The company is looking at Himachal Pradesh and Uttaranchal for financial benefits for the new plant. It is likely to be outside Haryana as the company intends to broaden its production base.

 Hero Honda, which controls 50 per cent of the motorcycle market in India, is expecting to sell 3 million units this year.

 It has set a sales target of 3.5 million for the next year. However, existing facilities would not suffice for that.

 It will take us at least a year to build the plant, Sobti said at the launch of Glamour, a deluxe segment motorbike in Calcutta. He also outlined Hero Hondas plan to foray into the scooter segment.

 The first model will be rolled out by the year-end. It will be priced around Rs 40,000.

 Even though Hero Honda was instrumental in making motorcycles dominate the domestic two-wheeler market, it does not want to miss out on the scooter segment now. Around 80 per cent of the two-wheeler sales come from motorcycles. It will be foolish for us leave out the scooter market with a volume of 1 million, Sobti said.

 Annuity plans offered by life insurance companies should be looked upon as retirement buffer, says Chandralekha Tulal

 In 1653, a Neapolitan banker named Lorenzo Tonti developed a method called the tontine for raising money in France. Under this arrangement, subscribers purchased shares in exchange for income generated from the capital investment. Once a shareholder died, the person?s income was distributed among the surviving partners until the last person alive collected all the benefits. The use of tontines spread to Britain and the United States where governments used them to finance public works projects.

 The current-day annuity plan, which is becoming a popular retirement vehicle, is fashioned on the principles of tontine. 

 An annuity is an investment that you make, either in lump sum or through instalments over a certain number of years (accumulation phase). In return, you receive a specific sum at regular intervals, either for life or for a fixed number of years (payout phase).

 Typically, annuities are bought to generate income during ones retired life, which is why they are also called pension plans. One has to be at least 50 years to start receiving annuity from these plans.

 Since the pension industry has not yet developed in our country, mostly insurance companies offer pension plans other than the basic insurance plans of term, endowment, money-back and whole-life policies. Some mutual funds also offer plans touted as pension schemes.

 Annuities differ from all the other forms of life insurance in one fundamental way ? an annuity does not provide any life insurance cover but offers an income either for life or a certain period. 

 However, some life insurance companies often tie up a life cover with the annuity plans during the accumulation phase.

 If someone chooses not to opt for a life cover but passes away during the accumulation phase, the premium is returned to the nominee.

 Apart from term insurance, one has the option to receive a lump sum amount from either an endowment plan or a money-back plan according to the term chosen by the insured. 

 However, for pension plans one can start receiving money only after the age of 50 . Further, at the vesting age, one has the option to withdraw up to 33 per cent of the accumulated sum.

 The tax aspect of these plans differs from other insurance plans too. Premiums contributed to insurance plans up to a limit and the total maturity amount are tax free. On the other hand, though contributions made to pension plans is tax free up to a limit, the annuity income is taxable.

 Broadly, there are two types of annuities ? immediate and deferred.

 In the first case, you start receiving annuity payments as soon as you pay the premium, which is usually a lump sum. In case of a deferred annuity, payment to the annuitant commence after a certain point of time. Typically, the annuitant pays premiums in instalments during the deferment period.

 For a deferred annuity, the premium paid is less because the deferment period allows the insurance company to invest the money at a profit, thereby reducing the cost of the annuity.

 As of now, only Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) offers immediate annuity known as Jeevan Akshay III. The private players offer tied annuity, which means annuities for those who have accumulated with the company.

 In an annuity plan, you have the option to choose the number of accumulating years and decide when you want to start receiving pension (known as vesting).

 There are several options that can be exercised when the proceeds of an annuity are distributed.

 The first is Life Annuity, which guarantees you a specified amount of income for your life. On death, the annuity payments cease and the investment may or may not be refunded to your successor, depending on the option chosen for return of purchase price.

 Then there is Guaranteed-period Annuity (Certain and Life) which not only provides a specified income for the lifetime but also guarantees that the successor receives payments for a certain minimum number of years, say 10, even if the annuitant dies earlier. 

 On the other hand, if the annuitant lives longer than 10 years, the person is entitled to receive annuity payments for the lifetime. 

 Another option is Annuity (Certain), under which the stipulated annuity is paid for a fixed number of years, irrespective of how many more years you live. The remaining amount may or may not be returned, depending on the option chosen for return of purchase price.

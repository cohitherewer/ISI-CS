 SBI sets date for merger of associates

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Purwar: All in one

 Mumbai, June 9: State Bank of India (SBI) today said the much talked-about merger of its seven associate banks could take two to five years.

 SBI and its associate banks, which together have a 25 per cent share of the countrys banking business, are now working on integrating some of their functions, chairman A. K. Purwar told reporters after inaugurating a new office of the banks Mumbai circle today.

 On June 30, 2004, State Bank and its associate banks had more than 13,405 branches, accounting for approximately 27.5 per cent of the deposits with all banks and 25.5 per cent of their gross credit.

 The seven banks are already working in co-ordination in the areas of treasury operations. They also share a common information technology platform, which makes them an integrated entity in many ways, Purwar said. 

 Speculation about a merger of the associates has been doing the rounds for years now, but the State Bank top brass had never set a date or a deadline for the outcome.

 Today, Purwar laid those conjectures to rest by affirming that the combined entity ? State Bank and its offsprings ? could be in place five years from now. And, if all the pieces of the merger fall into place faster than expected, that time could come down to two years. However, the government will have to put in place the legal environment conducive to such consolidation, he said.

 Last week, finance minister P. Chidambaram said he wanted to see the SBI logo in every capital of the world. For this to happen, we will require new capital. We will examine the policies and restrictions, Chidambaram had said.

 SBI managing director Ashok Kini said size mattered for banks pitted against global players in business. We will look at acquiring a public sector bank when the time is ripe, he said, without naming a target. 

 On bringing its books in tune with world standards, Purwar said the SBI balance sheet and accounts would be compiled in line with US accounting rules by March 2006.

 Breather for directors

 R. VENKATARAMAN

 New Delhi, Sept. 27: In a judgment that company directors would welcome, the Supreme Court has ruled that they are not personally liable for payment of wages to workmen under the Payment of Wages Act. 

 The ruling came on an appeal against a Madhya Pradesh High Court order, which had said the directors of a cotton company were personally responsible for payment of wages to the workers after the closure of the company.

 It cannot be held that the directors had any personal liability, the apex court said in its verdict yesterday. The basic premises on which the high court proceeded to conclude that the directors of the company were personally responsible to pay the wages are clearly untenable, Justices Arijit Passayat and H.K. Sema said.

 The company had in 1991 filed an application to close its cotton unit. Though the labour court ruled that the layoff was illegal, the industrial court upheld the companys decision. This order was challenged in the high court, which directed payment of 50 per cent of arrears and dearness allowance and said the directors were personally liable for payment of wages.

 The apex court set aside the order. The judgment of the high court is not sustainable, said Justice Passayat, who wrote the verdict for the bench. It shall be in the interest of the employees if the properties of the company which are stated to be under the control of (the) official liquidator are disposed of early so that the employees can be paid whatever is legally due to them, he added.

 Similarly, the other creditors (of the company) can be paid and the liability (of the company towards the employees and the creditors) can be discharged, the bench said in its order, a copy of which was made available today.

 The bench also said the judiciary should be cautious and circumspect while cracking open the corporate shell.

 The doctrine of lifting of the veil has been applied in exceptional cases where courts have felt the individual shareholder is liable for its (companys) acts, the court said. But it would not be possible to evolve a rational, consistent and inflexible principle, which can be invoked in determining the question on whether the veil of the company should be lifted or not, it added.

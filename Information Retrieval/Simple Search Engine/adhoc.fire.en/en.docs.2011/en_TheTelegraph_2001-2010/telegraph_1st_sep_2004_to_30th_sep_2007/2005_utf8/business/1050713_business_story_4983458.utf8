 Andhra in jam as VW row careens out of control

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Reddy: Walking the extra mile

 Hyderabad, July 12: The Andhra Pradesh government today admitted it had funnelled cash into a special purpose vehicle (SPV) established by disgraced Volkswagen executive Helmuth Schuster, who was spearheading the German carmaker?s entry into India. The state government had paid 2 million euros (Rs 11 crore) as its contribution to the corpus of Vashista Wahan, a front company floated by Schuster, who has since resigned from VW. 

 The payment had been made because Schuster wanted a financial commitment from the Andhra government before Europe?s biggest carmaker invested almost Rs 8,000 crore in a car assembly plant in the port city of Visakhapatnam. 

 ?We will not spare any efforts to bring the project to Andhra Pradesh,? chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy said here today on his return from an eight-day trip to West Asia and Israel. 

 The government?s admission only appeared to buttress the charge made by the German media over two weeks ago about a bribery scandal enveloping Schuster and other top executives at VW, forcing the carmaker to order an inquiry. 

 On Monday, VW?s head of personnel, Peter Hartz ? and Schuster?s boss ? resigned, owning responsibility for the shenanigans of his deputies. 

 Reddy, however, said the investment made by his government in Vashisht Wahan was safe and there was nothing to worry about even as he took a swipe at the Opposition for raising a ruckus over the bribery scandal. 

 ?The amount was released on June 13 on the advice of Schuster, the CEO of VW?s India operations,? said state industry minister B. Satyanarayana. He said the funds had been released after Schuster had sent a letter on January 10 seeking ?a nominal participation to display its (Andhra Pradesh government?s) interest in the project?. 

 ?Schuster had indicated in the letter that the amount be released to Vashishta Wahan, a nominated company of the Volkswagen group,? Satyanarayana said.

 Reddy told reporters that there were no reason to fear that Andhra would lose the car project as a fall-out of the sex-and-sleaze scandal that has engulfed VW in India and South Africa. He added that he received a positive response from VW on Monday on the fate of the Vizag project. 

 VW ordered a freeze on all the decisions taken by its tainted executives. This threw a cloud of uncertainty over the Vizag project.

 He said a high-level meeting chaired by Reddy had discussed the implications of the snowballing VW scandal on the Andhra project. ?An official team headed by secretary of investments and infrastructure, K. V. Rao, will leave for Germany soon,? he added.

 He read out a portion of the e-mail sent by Volkswagen to Reddy late on July 11 in which the firm expressed concern over the media hype and bungling on the issue. 

 ?There is a suspicion of fraud and breach of trust in the public arena,? said the VW e-mail and assured that there was no threat to ?our common India project?. He said the AP government has not bribed anyone, including Schuster. ?We are in touch with the Volkswagen board. We have been assured of a positive reply soon,? Satyanarayana added. 

 The industry minister said the Congress government had not gone out of the way to please the German company. The TDP was equally guilty of promoting AP as a hub for industrial investment. 

 ?Schuster had been a privileged guest of the Naidu government on several occasions,? the industry minister added. ?They were treated like damads (sons-in-law) by hosting special dinners and lunches at his home on more than three occasions,? Satyanarayana said. The TDP had also inducted Ashok Jain, an associate of Shuster in Vashist Wahan, into the AP tourism board as a director. 

 D.A. Somayajulu, state advisor on economic affairs who was also party to correspondence with Volkswagen, said the government had not blindly accepted the credentials of Vashist Wahan. 

 ?We made discreet enquiries with Indian embassy in Germany about its credentials. The officials said that if Volkswagen had indicated the name in writing, there was nothing to worry.?

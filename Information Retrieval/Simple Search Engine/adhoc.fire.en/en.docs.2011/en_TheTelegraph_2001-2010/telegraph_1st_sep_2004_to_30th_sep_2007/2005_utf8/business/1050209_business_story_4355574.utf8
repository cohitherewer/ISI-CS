 Petronet faces takeover code glitch

 New Delhi, Feb. 8 (PTI): A government missive to Petronet LNG on the appointment of its new managing director and CEO may trigger Sebi?s takeover code, which requires promoters to make an open offer for picking up 20 per cent equity. 

 The oil ministry has changed norms for appointment on Petronet in way that makes it easier for it to name an IAS officer of the joint-secretary rank as a successor to current chief Suresh C. Mathur when he retires on March 31. 

 Petronet is a board-managed firm with a representative each from ONGC, IOC, BPCL, Gail, French consultant Gaz de France and Asian Development Bank. The petroleum secretary is the non-executive chairman, while managing director and CEO is a professional selected by a board committee. 

 Petronet LNG has gone out of the ministry?s talent pool to hire professionals to head its finance and technical departments. 

 If a joint secretary joins the board, the control of the company will pass into the hands of government and firms under it. Such a move will trigger Sebis takeover code and public sector firms and/or government will have to make an open offer for acquiring a 20 per cent stake, industry sources said. 

 Section 12 of Sebis takeover code states: ?Irrespective of whether or not there has been any acquisition of shares or voting rights in a company, no acquirer shall take control over the target company, unless such person makes a public announcement to acquire shares and acquires shares in accordance with the regulation.?

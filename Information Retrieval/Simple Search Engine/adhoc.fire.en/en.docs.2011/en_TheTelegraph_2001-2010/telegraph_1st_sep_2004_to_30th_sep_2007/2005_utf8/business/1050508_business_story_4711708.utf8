 Sebi strict on governance norms

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 7: The market regulator has threatened to impose stringent penalties on companies who do not comply with corporate governance norms of appointing a requisite number of independent directors on their boards by the year end.

 ?There could be penalties that are uncomfortable and would erode investor confidence. Therefore, companies should realise that the cost of compliance is not a very high price to pay,? said Sebi chief M. Damodaran. 

 Sebi has extended the last date of compliance to clause 49 of the listing agreement to December 31.

 Initiating a discussion on the widely debated issue of independent directors, he said, ?They are independent of promoters and majority shareholders of the company. They are not in the opposition and are expected to add value and ensure that the promoters dont run away with the money.?

 Damodaran said many companies were apprehensive about the conduct and reliability of such independent directors. ?I cant understand why is it we (promoters) versus they (independent shareholders). Sebi is not appointing them for you...where is the question of conflict??

 Agreeing that there will be a cost of compliance which the companies will have to bear, he said, ?Look at this cost as an investment and not as an expenditure.?

 He argued that with a country of over one billion, it should not be difficult for companies to find 25,000 independent directors.

 ?I am not convinced that if companies seriously look around, they will not have independent directors on their boards. I will not buy this explanation now or after December 31,? he said.

 The Sebi board is also likely to clear the takeover code by the end of this month.

 ?We are working on the takeover code. Sometime next week, a proposal will be ready for the Sebi board, which is likely to clear it by the month end,? Damodaran, said.

 Industry wants simpler, investor-friendly disclosure norms, which will focus on the essentials with the right target audience in mind.

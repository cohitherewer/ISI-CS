 3:2 bonus from Kotak Bank

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 7: The board of Kotak Mahindra Bank has recommended a bonus issue of three shares for every two held.

 The 3:2 bonus issue, however, will take the paid-up equity of the bank to over Rs 300 crore, which satisfies the license condition of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). 

 During the year, the bank has recorded almost 8 per cent growth in its net profit at Rs 84.89 crore compared with Rs 78.73 crore in the previous fiscal. Though its total income for the last fiscal increased to Rs 552.38 crore against Rs 383.14 crore in 2003-04, the bank suffered a loss on the treasury front operations which restricted the rise in net profits.

 The bank declared a 12 per cent growth in net profits for the fourth quarter of 2004-05. Net profits rose to Rs 23.08 crore compared with Rs 20.59 crore in the comparable quarter of the previous year. 

 However, the banks net interest income on a stand-alone basis jumped 32 per cent to Rs 225.48 crore during 2004-05 against Rs 170.87 crore in the previous fiscal. 

 Addressing a news conference here today, Uday Kotak, executive vice chairman cum managing director, Kotak Mahindra Bank, said the bank was in the process of rapidly expanding its branch network. 

 While the initial plans were to set up 100 branches before 2008 from the present number of 38, this programme is now being accelerated.

 MTNL to approach tribunal 

 New Delhi, Jan. 11 (PTI): Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd (MTNL) will approach within two days the Telecom Dispute Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) against the Trai order that brings access deficit charge regime from February 1.

 ?We are approaching the TDSAT in a day or two. While the amount of financial loss is still being worked out, the amount is not important to us. It is a matter of principle. If ADC is available to BSNL, the same principle should be applied to us,? CMD R. S. P. Sinha said.

 The company had earlier said that it would ?protest? the new regime. ?ADC was available to MTNL since the last two years and Trai was convinced about this... On what basis now we have been denied of this compensation?? Sinha asked.

 Fixed operators like MTNL used to receive ADC on incoming long distance calls terminating on their network. In the new regime, they will not receive ADC and stand to lose revenue. 

 Industry sources say MTNLs loss could be about Rs 400 crore a year due to the new ADC regime.

 Meanwhile, Trai sources said they had done their calculations before bringing out the new ADC regime and nobody stood to lose according to those calculations.

 ?We are very clear on our calculations. Every operator has the right to follow the course of natural justice,? sources in the regulator said.

 Cellular operators have said they would not go against the tribunal order.

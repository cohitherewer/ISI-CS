 Birla will war spills over into boardrooms

 DEVADEEP PUROHIT 

 Calcutta, Sept. 2: The tremors of the legal battle over succession in the MP Birla group are now rocking boardrooms. 

 Representatives of various Birla groups ? Basant Kumar (BK), Ganga Prasad (GP), Sudarshan Kumar (SK) ? have served notices under section 257 of the Companies Act on Jute Investment Co. and Rameshwara Jute Mills seeking representation on their boards.

 The management control of the two closely-held companies has been with the MP Birla Group, which owns 22.2 per cent of Jute Investment Co and 31.26 per cent of Rameshwara Jute Mills. No other shareholder holds more.

 The reins of these firms have been with R.S. Lodha ever since Priyamvada Birla named the Calcutta chartered accountant as the sole successor to group assets in a 1999 will that is now at the root of the legacy row.

 However, employees of various Birla groups, which do not have a seat on the boards of the two firms, have now raised the ante to secure their share of the representation. This is being seen as an indication that Birla factions are joining forces to challenge Lodha?s control.

 Rameshwara Jute Mills has mining rights in Orissa. Jute Investment, too, ?owns significant properties?.

 ?We have sent them notices to put us on the boards. If they do not, we will force a voting during the firms? annual general meetings,? said a source in the Birla family. The meetings are scheduled sometime this month. 

 If the Birlas ? BK, GP, SK and Krishna Kumar ? join hands, the MP Birla group will cease to be the single-largest stakeholder in the two companies, and lose control.

 Lodha?s lawyer, Anindya Mitra, accused the Birlas of trying to ?upset the management pattern in MP Birla firms. Mitra, who was making these points during a hearing on the appointment of an administrator for Priyamvada?s estates, also alleged that the Birlas did not have the intention of protecting the properties and their action ?was against smooth functioning of the group?. 

 ?The Birlas are now trying to secure control of MP Birla group firms,? said a Birla Building source. 

 He pointed to the way the G.P. Birla group assumed control of Mumbai?s Indian Smelting and Refining Co within three days of Priyamvada?s death. According to him, C.K. Birla was appointed chairman of the company on July 6, 2004.

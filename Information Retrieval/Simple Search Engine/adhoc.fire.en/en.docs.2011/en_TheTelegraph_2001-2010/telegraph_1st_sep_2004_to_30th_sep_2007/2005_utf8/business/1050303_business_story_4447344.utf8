 Asian sales help Tyco prune debt

 Breen: Reaping gains

 Shanghai, March 2 (Reuters): Diversified manufacturer Tyco aims to slash debt by about a third to $10 billion by the end of fiscal 2005, helped by a double-digit percentage jump in Asian sales this year, its top executive said on Wednesday.

 Asia sales for Tyco International Ltd, which makes everything from hypodermic needles to printed circuit boards, should grow faster than a forecast 4 to 6 per cent increase in global revenues this year, chief executive Ed Breen said.

 Booming demand for healthcare, electronics and construction materials, especially in Tyco?s top Asian market, China, would help Asia account for about a quarter of global turnover in five years, up from 14 per cent now, Breen said.

 ?Tyco is basically close to not having to pay off any more debt,? Breen said before meeting Shanghai government officials.

 ?We have another quarter or two to get down to about $10 billion in net debt.?

 There were no plans to get debt below $10 billion, he added. Tyco had debt of $15.5 billion at December 31, the end of its first quarter. Global revenues were $40 billion last year. ?A large part of our business is driven by big commercial construction. And there?s nowhere else in the world that?s building like China,? he said.

 Bermuda-based Tyco?s competitors include General Electric, Honeywell and United Technologies Corp.

 Breen, a former Motorola Inc executive, is credited with turning Tyco around after the company was plunged into scandal in 2002 over two former executives charged with looting it of $600 million.

 Breen, 49, denied speculation he would take the top job at world number-two computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co, replacing an ousted Carly Fiorina.

 He laughed off such speculation. ?There?s absolutely no truth to that.?

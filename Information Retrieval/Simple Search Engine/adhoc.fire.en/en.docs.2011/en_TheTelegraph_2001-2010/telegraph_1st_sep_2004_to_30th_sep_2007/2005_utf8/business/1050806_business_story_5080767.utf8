 Calcutta, Aug. 5: Bengal versus Tamil Nadu ? that is the contest for the countrys fourth submarine cable landing station.

 Dayanidhi Maran, minister for communications and information technology, said today a decision on the location of the fourth landing station ? after Chennai, Kochi and Mumbai ? would be taken in three months. The feasibility report is expected in three months. We will then decide on the best option. This point will be later connected to the international gateway in Singapore, he said.

 Proximity to landing stations, which help faster and cheaper transfer of voice and non-voice data, can give a fillip to the states IT and IT-enabled services industry. Whenever I meet members of Parliament from the state, they forcefully place their demand for a landing station in Haldia. We are conducting a feasibility study to select the right location, said Maran.

 The minister hails from Tamil Nadu, which is going to polls next year, as is Bengal. A decision in favour of either state could become an achievement to tom-tom in the campaign. Bengals IT secretary G.D. Gautama said: Chennai already has a landing station. Hence we have requested the minister to consider Bengal.

 Maran was in town to open a computer component manufacturing facility of Xenitis at Sugandha in Hooghly. 

 Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, state IT minister Manab Mukherjee and a clutch of Left MPs ? Md Salim, Rupchand Pal and Anil Basu ? were also present on the occasion. We have proved our prowess in software and now we are doing well in hardware. If we can combine these two strengths, nothing can stop Bengal, said Bhattacharjee, praising first-generation entrepreneurs Santanu Ghosh and Tathagata Dutta, promoters of Xenitis. 

 Maran added: I am pleased that Indian firms are taking the lead in providing low-cost PCs. This will take computers to people and we will extend our help to more and more such companies.

 Xenitis is selling PCs for less than Rs 10,000 apiece.

 Maran had a few promises for Bengal. The Centre is keen to create more space in software technology parks in the state on availability of land. 

 I am sure that the Bengal chief minister is fast realising his dream as I see a hurry in creating the right infrastructure here. I think a lot of skilled people, who migrated elsewhere, will come back to Bengal, he said. 

 Bengal could also take part in a network of semiconductor fabrication centres that will require an investment of $4-5 billion. Maran said he was writing to all chief ministers to provide details of infrastructure facilities to support such a centre. The centres will be set up as joint ventures with US-based IEMC in technology collaboration with IBM. Maran also talked about the governments plan to set up community service centres across 6 lakh villages that will meet all local requirements from cradle to grave. 

 Later, during a meeting with Mukherjee, Maran extended an invitation to the state to be present in Delhi on August 24 to meet a 21-member delegation from Japan. He also suggested that the state participate at the IT meet in Tunis, scheduled in November.

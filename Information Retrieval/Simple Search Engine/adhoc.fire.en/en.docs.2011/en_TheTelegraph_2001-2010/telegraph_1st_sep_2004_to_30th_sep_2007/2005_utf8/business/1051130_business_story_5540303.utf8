 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Bhandari: Looking around

 Mumbai, Nov. 29: Centurion Bank of Punjab is planning to raise Rs 800 crore through a combination of preferential issue and a proposed international/domestic offering. 

 The bank proposes to raise Rs 384 crore by way of preferential allotment to three venture capital companies ? GW Capital, ChrysCapital and Citigroup Venture ? and Rs 416 crore via international/domestic offering.

 It will allot 7 crore shares to GW Capital and/or its affiliates at a price of Rs 19.25 apiece for a consideration of Rs 135 crore. A similar number of shares at the same price will be allotted to ChrysCapital. The bank will allot up to 5.9 crore shares for Rs 114 crore to Citigroup Venture Capital International Growth Partnership Mauritius Ltd. 

 Following the preferential offer, the three entities will hold 4-4.7 per cent stake each in the bank.

 The plan to raise funds through the preferential offer and the proposed domestic or international offering is in keeping with the need to grow organically, Shailendra Bhandari, managing director of Centurion Bank of Punjab, told The Telegraph. 

 ?Looking at the organic needs for the next few years, we require the capital. This is necessary as we are growing very fast,? he said.

 The bank is also open to acquisitions, Bhandari added.

 Talking about the proposed international/domestic offering, Bhandari said it is only an enabling resolution and the bank may raise the entire amount or a part of it.

 The bank has posted a substantial growth in net profit for the half-year ended September 30. Its earnings grew 358 per cent to Rs 38.5 crore compared with last year.

 Total advances were up 176 per cent at Rs 6,040 crore, while the deposit base grew 187 per cent at Rs 8,070 crore. 

 ?The merger has made Centurion Bank of Punjab one of the leading private sector banks. The integration process is on track to achieve considerable revenue and cost synergies. The plan to raise capital by up to Rs 800 crore reflects the board?s confidence that it will continue to achieve sustained growth in business volumes and profitability,? said chairman Rana Talwar.

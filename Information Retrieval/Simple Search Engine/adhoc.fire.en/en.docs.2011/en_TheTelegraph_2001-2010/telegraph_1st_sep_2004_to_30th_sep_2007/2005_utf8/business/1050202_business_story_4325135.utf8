 New Delhi, Feb. 1: LG Electronics India Ltd today launched third generation mobile phones to meet a huge demand anticipating the government?s decision to offer 3G spectrum to mobile operators.

 3G is a generic term used for the next generation of mobile communications systems. It will help operators provide more efficient systems at higher speeds for the transmission of existing services ? voice, text and data.

 Initially, with 3G, real-time information is pegged by operators as the most valuable service to end-users. Once the free internet access on mobile phone and more advanced devices are built, all this will change.

 Currently, these value added services are costly and beyond the reach of all mobile users due to the lack of spectrum for such services.

 LG is the first company to launch 3G mobile phones in India. The phones are likely to be priced between Rs 15,000 and Rs 30,000. The handset models ? U8110, U8120, U8130 and U8138 ? will be able to support download speeds of 384 kilo bits per second (kbps) based on universal mobile telecommunications service (UMTS) technology against the existing speed of 48 kbps offered by the general packet radio service technology. 

 The 384 kbps will allow streaming videos and the download of a three-hour movie in 20-30 minutes over these mobiles. Currently, in India, the maximum speed that is offered by mobile operators is 177 kbps using the Enhanced Data Rate for Global Evolution (EDGE) technology.

 The models launched by LG have live video streaming capability, video conferencing capability, three-dimensional gaming, continuous video recording and auto-launch browser.

 Deba Ghoshal, head brand management and product planning consumer electronics at LGEIL, said, ?Our brand focus during the year will be on new technology offering suited to the needs of customers in India. There is a huge demand waiting to blow amongst the replacement phones segment, the high-end customers and the corporate users.?

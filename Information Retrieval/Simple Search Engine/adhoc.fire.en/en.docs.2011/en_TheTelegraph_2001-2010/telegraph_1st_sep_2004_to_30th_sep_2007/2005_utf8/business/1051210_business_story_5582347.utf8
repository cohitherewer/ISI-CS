 Calcutta, Dec. 9: Petrobras, the state-owned oil company of Brazil, and CVRD, one of the Samba countrys top five companies, are keen on setting up shops in India.

 These large Brazilian companies have promised that they will soon open their offices in India, said Jose Vicente Pimentel, ambassador of Brazil in India. Pimentel was addressing a session on bilateral trade relations between Brazil and India organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 Petr?leo Brasileiro, or Petrobras, is an integrated company engaged in exploration, production, refining, trading, and transportation of petroleum and its by-products at home and abroad. The company operates in four business areas of exploration and production, downstream, gas and energy, and international operations. 

 Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) is the largest diversified mining company in Latin America. It is the world leader in iron ore and pellet market and is the second largest global producer of manganese and iron alloys. CVRD is also the largest provider of logistics services in Brazil.

 The Brazilian government is also keen on negotiating a free trade agreement with India, mentioned Pimentel. According to him, it will lead to a substantial increase in trade between the two countries.

 Bilateral trade in the first 10 months of the current calendar grew 120 per cent when compared with the trade figure for the whole of 2004. The value of trade between Brazil and India is expected to be around $2.5 billion this year. But the figure is far below the actual potential, said Pimentel.

 In order to create close ties with India, the Brazilian government will soon open a Consulate General in Mumbai, said Pimentel. Also, we hope that the bilateral joint commission meeting, which will held in Brazil on January 30 next, will further enhance the agenda, he added.

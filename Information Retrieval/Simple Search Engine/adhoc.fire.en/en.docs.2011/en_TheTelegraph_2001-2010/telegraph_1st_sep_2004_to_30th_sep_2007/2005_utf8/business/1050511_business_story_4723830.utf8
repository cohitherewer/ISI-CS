 Price freeze sparks IOC bond float

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Money matters

 New Delhi, May 10: Indian Oil Corporation will float bonds worth Rs 500-crore to finance its working capital needs, chairman S. Behuria said today. 

 The company is consulting SBI Caps and ICICI Securities to work out the modalities for the bond issue, which is likely to have a green-shoe option. 

 Behuria said the ?under-recoveries? of public sector oil marketing companies on sales of LPG, kerosene and petrol had risen to Rs 5,860 crore for the first two months of the current fiscal. 

 The under-recoveries have been estimated as the difference in what the companies would have earned if they were allowed to sell petroleum products at import parity prices, which includes a notional customs duty as well. They want the prices of petrol and diesel to be increased by around Rs 4.50 per litre. 

 Behuria painted a grim picture, saying IOC was being forced to increasingly go in for borrowings to meet its working capital and investment needs. The debt burden of the company in June will touch Rs 18,000 crore compared with Rs 10,000 crore in the same month last year. 

 With crude prices shooting up to $50 per barrel, there is little that oil companies can do to cut costs as crude accounts for 90 per cent of the cost of petroleum products. 

 Oil companies face a further drain on their cash reserves as they have not been allowed to pass on to consumers the additional cess of 50 paise per litre on petrol and diesel and the increase in the excise duty introduced in the budget. 

 IOC turned in an impressive profit last year because of the high margins of over $5 per barrel in its refinery division.

 However, oil companies have to buy kerosene and LPG at international prices, both from domestic refineries such as Reliance and MRPL, as well as from the international market. As the full amount of the subsidy is not reimbursed, the companies lose around Rs 90 on each LPG cylinder sold and over Rs 8 per litre on kerosene. 

 Oil companies have been backed by the petroleum ministry in their demand for a price hike but the move has run into a political hurdle as the Left parties are opposed to any increase in the price of petroleum products.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar has prepared a case for a hike but needs cabinet clearance for the move. However, with Left parties refusing to budge so far, the government has not been able to push through the decision.

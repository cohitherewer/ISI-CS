 Calcutta, Nov. 15: TM International Logistics is planning an initial public offer (IPO) to finance its expansion projects.

 The Tata Steel subsidiary will invest about Rs 350 crore in the next three years to expand operations, especially in buying ships.

 We will raise over Rs 150 crore for the same. We will approach the board in the next six months for its consideration, S.C. Saxena, managing director of the company, said at a press meet in Calcutta today.

 TM International, a 51:49 joint venture between Tata Steel and IQ Matrade, runs berth no 12 at Haldia. It also has chartering, freight forwarding, shipping and clearing businesses.

 Tata Steel will continue to be the largest shareholder in the company after the IPO, Saxena said.

 The capital expenditure plans comprise buying four ships and building at least one terminal anywhere in India.

 However, the company is also considering setting up a minor port on either coast of India. TM International has set up a team to come out with a strategic paper on the same.

 It will submit its report in three-four months to decide on the location.

 If we build a minor port, the total investment would go up by another Rs 150- 200 crore, Saxena told The Telegraph.

 The company is also mulling international alliance for warehousing, distribution and freight forwarding businesses.

 There are 2-3 companies, which can be our partner, he added.

 TM International also plans to foray to Sri Lanka, Myanmar and Bangladesh.

 All this will catapult the turnover of the company to Rs 1,000 crore in the next three years from Rs 300 crore it hopes to achieve in 2005-06.

 The shipping business would contribute about 47 per cent of the companys turnover by then compared with 9 per cent now. It would look at handymax and panamax vessels.

 However, prices were high at this point of time and the company was looking at the right opportunity to buy, said Dibyendu Bose, chief operating officer of TM International.

 The firm has recorded a compounded annual growth rate of 65 per cent in topline.

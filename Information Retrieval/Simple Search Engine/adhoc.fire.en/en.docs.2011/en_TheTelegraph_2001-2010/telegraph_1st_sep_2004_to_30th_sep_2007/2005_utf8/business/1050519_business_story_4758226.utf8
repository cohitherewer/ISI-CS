 IDFC files prospectusfor maiden flotation

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 18: Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IDFC) has filed a red herring prospectus with Sebi for a public issue of 40.36 crore shares.

 The 100 per cent book-built offer comprises a fresh issue of 12 crore shares of Rs 10 each and another 28.36 crore shares at a price to be determined through bids received from investors.

 The objective of the issue is to achieve benefits of listing, raise capital to support growth in assets and meet capital adequacy requirements.

 The company has appointed Kotak Mahindra Investment Banking as the lead manager, DSP Merrill Lynch as senior co-managers, while Karvy Computershare has been appointed as registrar to the issue, it said. 

 IDFC is the only institution that specialises in the funding of core sector projects.

 With the country in the midst of a major expansion drive in airports, ports, roads, telecom, power generation and distribution, analysts say IDFC will have its hands full. 

 Bigger players like SBI, IDBI and ICICI are chanelling part of their funds into the retail sector, which is more remunerative and is growing at a faster pace.

 The government owns 20 per cent of IDFC, the Reserve Bank of India has 15 per cent and the Industrial Development of India owns 5 per cent. 

 Multilateral agencies like the Asian Development Bank and the International Finance Corporation, an arm of the World Bank, own another 40 per cent. 

 The rest is with ICICI Bank, State Bank of India and a few other financial institutions.

 Better than the best 

 A combo may offer more than ULIP in the long run, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay

 Insurers have been making money hand over fist by hard-selling unit-linked insurance policies (ULIPs) ? and investors have been lulled into believing that it?s the best place to park their cash. The plug for ULIPs is the double benefit: the benefit of insurance and big returns on equity investments.

 The chances are that your insurance agent hasnt even spoken to you about the term assurance policy ? the lowest cost, pure risk cover plan in which the policyholder doesnt get back the premia paid on survival of the policy term.

 And why should he? A prospective buyer would baulk at the idea of non-refund of his premia. Moreover, an agent?s commission is low in a term assurance plan as it is the lowest cost among all individual life insurance plans.

 ULIPs have been all the rage over the last couple of years. But have you pored over an illustration to check out whether you are being best served by ULIP vis-?-vis other traditional life insurance plans?

 The alternative 

 A combo offer ? a combination of a term assurance plan and diversified equity schemes of mutual funds ? beats ULIP hands down.

 Let us check this out. Split the yearly premium you have decided to pay for the chosen unit-linked plan into two: with one part, buy a term assurance plan despite the fact that you won?t get back the premium amount at the end of the policy term, and invest the other part in mutual funds. In the end, you get more than from ULIP (see tables) and you dont have to lower your life cover, too.

 How does it work

 First a caveat: We have taken a leading private life insurance company as a sample. This is because other insurers play by more or less the same rules in ULIP game ? charge higher expenses in the initial years of their unit-linked plans, offer an equity option on ULIP investment and more or less the same yearly premium for a given sum assured.

 The insurer charges a 15 per cent entry fee (on regular premium) for its ULIP for the first year, 10 per cent for the second and the third year and 5 per cent from the fourth year onwards. This is in addition to an administrative charge of Rs 70 per month, a 1.5 per cent fund management charge for the equity (growth) fund option and the annual mortality charge. The sum of all these charges is deducted from the premium. The net premium is then invested in the policyholder?s desired fund option. 

 Among these expenses, only the mortality charge varies with the age of the policyholder. It is calculated by multiplying the ?sum at risk?, which is the sum assured net of premium paid minus the unit value accumulated at the policyholder?s account, by the mortality rate corresponding to the age of the policyholder. So, after a few initial years, the mortality charge becomes nil.

 The arithmetic

 A 30-year-old, paying an annual premium of Rs 1 lakh for a ULIP of the insurer for a term of 20 years, gets a sum assured of Rs 10 lakh. If he goes for a 20-year term assurance plan, he will have to pay an annual premium of only Rs 2,454 for Rs 10 lakh sum assured. The premium balance of Rs 97,546 can be invested in mutual fund schemes. 

 For the sake of comparison, we assume that the investor chooses the equity (or growth) fund in both the investment options, namely, ULIP and mutual fund and each of them yields a 10 per cent annual return to his investment. At the end of 10 years, the combo option accumulates Rs 1,01,306.70 more than ULIP fund and after 20 years, the difference is Rs 3,05,662.25.

 The reason is that the expenses in ULIPs are quite high in the initial years and the fund accumulation for the first few years falls short of the premium cost even at a 10 per cent annual return on investment. In other words, virtually no accumulation takes place during those years. In the combo option, the investor pays only 2.50 per cent each year for entering a mutual fund scheme. Hence the investor?s investible fund is higher than in a ULIP option.

 Tax benefit

 Are you wondering whether you will be able to take advantage of the income-tax benefit? Opt for equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS) of mutual funds instead of the regular diversified equity schemes. 

 These schemes enjoy tax benefits as life insurance products even under the changed section 80C. And now, you can pool in Rs 1 lakh for investment from your past savings and reap the section 80C benefit.

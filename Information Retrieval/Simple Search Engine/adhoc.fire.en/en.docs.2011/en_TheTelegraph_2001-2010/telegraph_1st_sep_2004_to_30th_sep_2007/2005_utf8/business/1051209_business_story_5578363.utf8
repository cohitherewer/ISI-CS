 Calcutta, Dec. 8: Nasscom, the apex body for the software industry, has suggested creating special education zones to house universities and technical institutes within a single campus. These zones will be built on the lines of special economic zones (SEZs) in manufacturing and try to remove bureaucratic restrictions on the education sector and hone the skills of students to meet the demands of the industry.

 Education is a crucial element of the IT sector, which thrives on human talent. Higher education is gaining popularity in the country, but there are many constraints. Educational bureaucracy, rules and procedures governing admission and by-the-book education are some of the issues that have to be urgently addressed. This limits the benefits of education and stunts growth, Nasscom president Kiran Karnik said at Infocom 2005 organised by Nasscom and Businessworld, an ABP group publication.

 The special zones will also serve as a platform to integrate India with the global education system. 

 India produces around 3 million graduates and 450,000 engineers every year.

 The numbers are good, but we need to hone the skills of the students to meet the demands of the IT industry. Also the demand for human resources outside the country is on the rise. We need to groom students to meet this demand. The number of graduates also have to be increased substantially, said Karnik.

 Nasscom feels that the concept should be implemented on a pilot basis by either the government or the industry. The apex body could help students gain access to easy finance schemes and other facilities to allow them avail of higher education.

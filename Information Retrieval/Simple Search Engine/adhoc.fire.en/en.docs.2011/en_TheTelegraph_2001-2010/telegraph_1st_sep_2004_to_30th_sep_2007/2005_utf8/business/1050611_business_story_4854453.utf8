 Richie rich

 Mumbai, June 10: Here?s some good news. More Indians are turning millionaires by the day. 

 The growth in the number of millionaires in India outpaced the world average in 2004. It was fuelled by brisk growth in the economy and a boom in the local stock markets.

 These findings are part of a report compiled by Merrill Lynch and Capgemini. It says that in 2004, the group of Indian millionaires swelled 14.6 per cent to 70,000. 

 ?India continued to be one of the high-growth areas in 2004. Around 9000 more people joined the elite list of high networth individuals in 2004,? said Raj Sehgal, Merrill Lynch Global Private Client?s country head for India.

 The Indian elite added more wealth despite a slump in stock prices in the middle of 2004. It recovered when the capital market hit a high in the second half.

 ?India featured prominently among major stock exchanges in emerging economies with a strong growth rate in market capitalisation,? Sehgal said from Switzerland.

 The number of individuals with a networth of at least $1 million, excluding their primary residence, grew 7.3 per cent to 8.3 million, a net increase of 600,000 world-wide. 

 North America led with a nearly 10 per cent growth rate to 2.7 million individuals, surpassing the 2.6 million in Europe. Asia-Pacific?s growth rate of over 8 per cent to 2.3 million wealthy people was twice that of Europe.

 China?s figure was average as its millionaires grew 4.3 per cent to 2,99,500 even though a comparison with India would be out of place as Chinas base was much larger. 

 Singapore created millionaires at a much faster pace of 22.4 per cent to 48,500, a smaller base than India. 

 Capgemini and Merrill Lynch are investment bankers who hope to wean away a lot of Indian millionaires on to their clientele list to manage their wealth. DSP Merrill Lynch, the Indian affiliate, manages the wealth of 450 Indian families who put aside a minimum portfolio size of Rs 2.5 crore each for Merrill Lynch wealth managers to grow them faster.

 ?Look at the salaries fresh IIM graduates command nowadays,? says Shitin Desai, executive vice-chairman at DSP Merrill Lynch. ?I want to go back to school,? he said and added that the growth of Indian millionaires would be faster.

 FII fright sends stocks swooning

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 13: Share prices today tumbled across the board on liquidity worries that primarily revolved around the future of FII interest in Indian equities. The sensex sank 164 points as the wave of concern swept aside optimism from the robust second-quarter numbers announced by software majors.

 The principal concern is now whether foreign institutional investors, who played a key role in propelling the indices to record levels, will continue to invest in Indian markets as valuations look a bit stretched compared with their peers in other markets. 

 The valuation factor apart, there are worries that the strengthening of the dollar and rising interest rates in the US could lessen interest in Indian stocks.

 The frantic selling that followed affected nearly all heavyweights, including the technology pack that had declared better-than-expected second-quarter numbers. All indices on the BSE closed in the red due to the selling pressure. 

 The selling pressure went in hand with an increase in volatility. The sensex opened weak at 8520.48, hit an intra-day high of 8547.80. Later, it plumbed the days low of 8346.32 before closing at 8376.90, a fall of 163.66 points or 1.92 per cent.

 A key highlight of the days session was the performance of the healthcare segment, which turned into a bitter pill for investors. Worries here stemmed from Ranbaxy Laboratories losing a patent challenge in the UK against Pfizers anti-cholesterol drug. 

 Ranbaxy was under intense pressure from the beginning of trading as many investors had built up positions expecting a favourable verdict. The scrip plummeted to a days low of Rs 442.50 after opening weak at Rs 480. It closed at Rs 458.40, marking a fall of Rs 30.75 or 6 per cent over its previous finish. Incidentally, Ranbaxy was the biggest loser among index shares. 

 Ranbaxys loss to Pfizer in the patent challenge case led to heavy selling pressure in other pharmaceutical shares due to concerns over the success of pursuing a strategy of growing through such challenges. With the US generic market already witnessing a price erosion, it is felt that domestic pharmaceutical companies will have hard times ahead. This was reflected in the share price of Dr Reddys, which came down by Rs 40.40 to Rs 897.00.

 Rupee weaker

 The rupee closed at a new low of 44.95 against the dollar as worries about high oil prices combined with concerns over thinning foreign capital flows.

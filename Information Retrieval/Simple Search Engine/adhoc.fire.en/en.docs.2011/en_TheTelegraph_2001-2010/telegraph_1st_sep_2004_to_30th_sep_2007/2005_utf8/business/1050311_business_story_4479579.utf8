 Grasim exits BK Birla cement firm

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, March 10: Grasim Industries has parted with its entire 1.42-per-cent stake in Basant Kumar Birla?s Mangalam Cement.

 Grasim, which is controlled by Kumar Mangalam Birla, had 400,000 shares in Mangalam Cement, which was named after him by grandfather B. K. Birla over two decades ago.

 Sources close to the development said it was an investment decision. ?It was an insignificant stake, which was monetised by selling in the open market,? sources added.

 Interestingly, Grasim was one of the bidders for ailing MCL along with Mexican cement giant Cemex SA a few years back. However, nothing had materialised then.

 The Mangalam Cement scrip rose 2.89 per cent on the National Stock Exchange (NSE). It touched an intra-day high of Rs 83.35 before closing at Rs 81.75. At today?s closing price, Grasim would have raked in Rs 3.27 crore.

 Grasim held the shares in Mangalam Cement from its inception. It was classified as ?persons acting in concert (PAC)? within the promoter group. 

 The Rajasthan-based cement company has recently received a Rs 213-crore bailout package from the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) for its revival. BIFR has also approved the conversion of optionally convertible cumulative redeemable preference shares into equity shares at par.

 Before the conversion was approved, Grasim held 2.16 per cent stake in the company with the promoter group having 35.65 per cent. BK Birla owned Kesoram Industries is the largest shareholder and promoter of the company with an 11.69 per cent stake.

 Other BK Birla group companies like Century Textiles and Jay Shree Tea hold 6.36 and 4.33 per cent stake, respectively. The Birla family?s investment firm Pilani Investment also owns 6.06 per cent as on December 31, 2004. Institutions hold about 17.05 per cent, while the public has 33.09 per cent.

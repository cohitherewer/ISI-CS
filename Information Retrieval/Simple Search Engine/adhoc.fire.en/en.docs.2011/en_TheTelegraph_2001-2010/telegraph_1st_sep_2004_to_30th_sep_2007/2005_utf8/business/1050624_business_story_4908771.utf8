 Haldia to get Iran gas through Hazira grid

 S. P. S. PANNU 

 New Delhi, June 23: Gail (India) will extend the Hazira-Bijapur-Jagdishpur pipeline to Haldia for transporting liquefied natural gas imported from Iran. The LNG will be regassified at the terminals on the western coast and fed into the pipeline.

 There will be sufficient supply of LNG as India has entered into a deal with Iran during petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyars recent visit to Tehran.

 B. S. Negi, Gail director, (business development), told The Telegraph that the company has surveyed the requirements of industrial units on the proposed route of the pipeline. The survey has revealed that there was a sufficient demand for the gas. 

 He said it would approximately cost Rs 3,000 crore to lay the pipeline from Jagdishpur in Uttar Pradesh to Haldia. 

 The first phase of the pipeline has begun work on the Jagdishpur-Allahabad stretch and tenders have been invited for the supply of pipes, he said.

 The Jagdishpur-Allahabad pipeline will supply gas to the Iffco fertiliser plant near Allahabad. It will be later extended to supply gas to SAIL plants in Durgapur and Rourkela and Tata Steel in Jamshedpur. Eventually, the pipeline will reach Haldia. Negi said steel companies have already indicated that they would buy the gas. 

 Gas through the (proposed) pipeline should reach Calcutta in three years, he said.

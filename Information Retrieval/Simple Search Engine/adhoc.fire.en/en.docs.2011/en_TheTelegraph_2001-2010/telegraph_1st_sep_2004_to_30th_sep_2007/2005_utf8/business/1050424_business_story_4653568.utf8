 Race for Rover assets hots up

 London, April 23: Firms in West Asia, India and Russia have expressed an interest in buying parts of the stricken car company MG Rover.

 Administrators called in to run the Longbridge-based car maker earlier this month are evaluating the potential bids.

 Joint administrator Tony Lomas said, ?Interest has been expressed by potential buyers from Southeast Asia, West Asia, India, Russia and China as well as from the UK.

 ?We have had over 200 expressions of interest and we will be looking at all of these.?

 Two Iranian car firms were reportedly among those expressing an interest.

 Iran Khodro and SAIPA were said to be planning to hold discussions about buying the rights and assets of MG Rover.

 Iran Khodro is the biggest car maker in West Asia and also makes Peugeots under licence, while SAIPA is the second largest car maker in Iran.

 There have been rumours for the past few days that Iranian firms were interested in buying parts of MG Rover but there has been no official confirmation.

 The administrators have announced that a further 200 workers, who had been at Longbridge for the past week completing cars which had been on the production line, have been made redundant.

 Around 5,000 Longbridge workers lost their jobs over a week ago when the company went into administration.

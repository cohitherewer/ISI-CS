 Calcutta, Feb. 2: Walt Disney plans to use television to build its brand in the country. Over the years, it wants to expand into other areas where the company is present globally.

 Rajat Jain, managing director of Walt Disney Television International (India), said, ?India is a cornerstone of Walt Disney Company?s expansion strategy and we are taking a long-term view to develop large business in the country.?

 ?We are focusing on building the brand through television and are evaluating local acquisitions in the field and talking to select players,? Jain said.

 However, Jain added that such acquisitions and local productions will have to concur with the company?s global standards and have an universal appeal. Jain said the long-term plans include producing movies, getting into radio, publishing, merchandising and theme parks. The company will venture into all the other areas where Walt Disney is present.

 Walt Disney Television made its debut in India in December with the launch of two 24-hour pay channels on TV ? Disney Channel and Toon Disney. Toon Disney is a totally animation feature-driven channel on the strength of the Disney library and is available in English, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. Star India is cable distributor for the channels.

 ?In south India, the television viewing hours is 2.5 times more than the national average and that is the rationale behind having the channel in the local languages,? said Jain. Disney Channel is available in both English and Hindi and offers a variety of programmes with a substantial dose of local content both in terms of concept and implementation. It also airs Playhouse Disney ? a two-hour pre-school programming block scheduled at 8 am on weekdays and 6 am on weekends. ?With the launch of our channel, we do not intend moving out of programming blocks in other channels. We have recently signed up an agreement to air Disney Time on a Star TV channel,? said Hema Govindan, head of marketing and communication, Walt Disney Television International (India).

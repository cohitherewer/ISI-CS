 Montek sure of high growth

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ahluwalia: Good shot

 New Delhi, Nov. 18: Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia today said it was feasible to attain an 8 per cent annual growth during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-12).

 ?My view is that an 8 per cent target is feasible and desirable to achieve on a sustained basis during the Eleventh Plan,? Ahluwalia said at the economic editors conference. 

 He, however, said a clear picture of the exact growth target would emerge only at the meeting of the Planning Commission. The target has to be approved by the National Development Council.

 He said the three priority areas for the new plan period would be infrastructure development, agriculture and social sectors like education and health. 

 The commission would aim at reducing the number of people below poverty line to 7-8 per cent during the Eleventh Plan period, he added.

 In 2001, 26 per cent of the population lived below poverty line and this was expected to come down to 21 per cent by the end of the Tenth Plan in 2007.

 ?Poverty has been decreasing by 1 per cent every year, which is not good enough,? Ahluwalia said. He also tried to play down the rift between the Planning Commission and the finance ministry regarding allocation of gross budgetary support for 2006-07.

 ?It is a routine thing. I have seen this happen for the last 20 years. It will get sorted out,? he said, adding that the final figures for gross budgetary support are yet to be firmed up and the issue has always been resolved at a meeting with the Prime Minister.

 Meanwhile, the plan panel has asked the state electricity boards (SEBs) to pull up their socks and hasten power reforms after losses worth Rs 28,000 crore were reported on account of power subsidy.

 ?The total losses of SEBs on account of subsidy were put at Rs 28,000 crore, which by itself is an under estimation,? Ahluwalia said, adding, ?I am not at all satisfied with power sector reforms.?

 The annual plan meetings, which started yesterday, will be used to impress upon chief ministers to take measures to clean up the administration of SEBs drastically, he said.

 ?I will ask the chief ministers to get their policies right in these (power) areas. These are important areas and they need to focus on setting these right,? he said.

 On the issue of subsidy, he said he did not have any ?ideological difference as long as it was affordable and targeted?.

 But ?unfortunately?, the power subsidies were not only improperly targeted but there has also been ?theft? of power under the garb of subsidy in all states, putting the SEBs in grave financial difficulties. 

 ?The subsidies are not only not targeted, a lot of them are plain theft,? he said.

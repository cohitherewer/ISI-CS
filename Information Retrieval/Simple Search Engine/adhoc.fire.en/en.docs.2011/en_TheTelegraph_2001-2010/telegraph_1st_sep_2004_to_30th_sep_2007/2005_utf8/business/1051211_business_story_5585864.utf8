 Iffco-Tokio to infuse fresh capital

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Dec. 10: Iffco-Tokio General Insurance Company Limited will pump in fresh capital worth Rs 100-120 crore in the current fiscal to meet its growth targets.

 We have made the necessary calculations regarding the capital required for our growth plans and the promoters will infuse fresh capital of Rs 120 crore in this fiscal, Iffco-Tokio managing director Ajit Narain said.

 The present capital base of the non-life company is Rs 100 crore. It is a joint venture between Indian Farmers Fertiliser Co-operative Limited (Iffco) and Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Company Limited, Japan.

 The company is targeting a gross premium income of Rs 750 crore for the current fiscal compared with last years premium income of Rs 501 crore. We have already achieved over Rs 500 crore till November and need to invest fresh capital to meet the growth target, Iffco-Tokio financial adviser M.K. Tandon said.

 We hope to end the year with a net profit of around Rs 18 crore against about Rs 15 crore achieved during the previous fiscal, added Tandon.

 Our strategy is to focus more on the retail segment, said Narain. At present, the retail and industrial businesses are distributed equally, but we want to increase the share of retail to 60 per cent over the next three to five years, he added. Iffco-Tokio is working on new products, which would be tailor-made to specific group and target segments.

 The company is currently working on weather insurance where it is developing a product to cater to not only shortage of rainfall but also excess rainfall, which has been witnessed by many parts of the country this year. It is also developing products to offer temperature cover.

 The company has recently launched a marine liability insurance product ? Sagar Bandhu Bima policy.

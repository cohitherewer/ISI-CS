 Branded PCs brandish strength

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Feb. 15: The Great Indian Key Shift is at work: Branded PCs are clawing their way back into business.

 After being battered by the assemblers in the grey market for over a decade, the branded PC makers have started winning back their marketshare as sales of 6.5 lakh PCs moved to the organised sector during the year. The domestic PC market grew by 28 per cent in 2003-04 and the slow tectonic shift in the marketplace has seen the share of the grey market assemblers plunge from 55 per cent four years ago to just 38 per cent now, says a study by Skoch, a strategy and management consultancy.

 The report says the surge in PC sales could be attributed to the sharp cut in prices that followed the customs and excise duty cuts during the year. But the other noticeable trend was the emergence of new brands on the street ? LG, Millennium, GES, EPC and Vesta ? that snapped up as much as 6 per cent of marketshare. Last year, the countrys infotech market logged a 26 per cent growth, to reach a total of $21.9 billion of which around 40 per cent was the local market for PCs, servers, and systems integration and other services.

 Skoch CEO Sameer Kochhar said, ?Local brands haven?t ramped up their distribution channels either. This will become a serious problem as zero import duty will make MNC brands even more competitive, indeed even the grey market will now turn legitimate this year.?

 Gujarat NRE set to diversify 

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, July 2: Gujarat NRE Coke Ltd (GNCL) is diversifying into steel making and power generation.

 The largest domestic non-captive metallurgical coke producer is setting up a 3-lakh-tonne-per-annum steel rebars facility at Gandhidham in Gujarat at a cost of about Rs 50 crore.

 The company will make rebars from sponge iron, scrap and ferro alloys.

 A top Gujarat NRE executive said the project would be completed by December 2005.

 The 20-mw power plant, at an investment of Rs 80 crore, will be ready by December 2006.

 It will utilise the waste heat recovery model to generate power. As a result, the cost will be Re 1 per unit compared with close to Rs 5 we are paying now, a top GNCL executive said.

 Initially, the company will mostly use sponge iron from the market to make rebars.

 Six months after the steel mill start working, the company intends to go for backward integration and set up a sponge iron manufacturing facility as well.

 According to initial estimates, the capacity will be equal to that of steel making (3 lakh tonnes). GNCL will invest another Rs 50 crore in the sponge iron facility.

 The company plans to use iron ore from its newly acquired Australian mining unit to feed the sponge iron plant.

 By the time the sponge iron unit is ready, mining is likely to begin in Australia, the company executive added.

 GNCL has acquired a 30 per cent stake in Zinico Resource NL, which has secured prospective iron ore and base metals projects in Tasmania in close proximity to existing world-class mining projects.

 The company claimed that it would still be cheaper to import coal from Australia than wheel it to Gujarat from mineheads in the country.

 The ocean freight from Australia to Gujarat ports is about $30 per tonne. On the contrary, inland freight from Orissa or Karnataka to Gujarat is $37 a tonne, the executive said.

 However, the company is still keeping the option open for local procurement of ore.

 The company will have raw material security of iron ore from the very beginning compared with other big integrated steel companies like Ispat and Essar.

 The company intends to fund the expansion plan through FCCB and internal accruals.

 Steel plants across the world are making a beeline for mines to hedge against irregular supply as well as soaring prices.

 The Gujarat NRE Coke stock, which opened at Rs 124.70 on Friday closed at Rs 122.10, down Rs 2.60 or 0.85 per cent, on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

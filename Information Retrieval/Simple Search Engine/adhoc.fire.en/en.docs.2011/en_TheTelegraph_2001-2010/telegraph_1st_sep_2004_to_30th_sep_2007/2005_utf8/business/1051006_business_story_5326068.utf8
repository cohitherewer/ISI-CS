 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 5: Calcutta High Court today directed the special officers making an inventory of the personal belongings of late Priyamvada Birla, widow of M. P. Birla, to remove the valuables, including gold coins and ornaments, and deposit them in nationalised bank lockers.

 Justice Kalyanjyoti Sengupta directed the four special officers appointed by him to keep the valuable ornaments, precious stones, besides gold coins of the Gupta, Maurya and Mughal era, already inventorised, in bank lockers for security reasons.

 The names of the nationalised banks and their branches would not be disclosed for security reasons.

 Three pistols, also found from an almirah in Priyamvadas residence, would be deposited with licensed arms dealers, the court directed.

 Justice Sengupta gave the direction to keep the valuables in bank lockers on an application by Lodha stating that the four armed guards cost him Rs 68,000 per month.

 He claimed that putting the valuables in bank lockers would be safe and save money.

 The court had earlier directed both Lodha and the Birlas to post four armed guards each to guard the valuables in almirahs at Priyamvadas house.

 The four special officers would use bank lockers for keeping the valuables till disposal of the case. The locker will be opened in the name of the special officers who have been appointed in the suit. 

 Rightful owner

 The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has clarified that Priyamvada Birla was the rightful owner of the precious gold coins that were found from her residence during the process of making the inventory.

 There are about 300 precious coins found during that process. There are coins from the period of Gupta, Maurya, Mughals and more. There are also coins bearing the imprint of Alexander the Great.

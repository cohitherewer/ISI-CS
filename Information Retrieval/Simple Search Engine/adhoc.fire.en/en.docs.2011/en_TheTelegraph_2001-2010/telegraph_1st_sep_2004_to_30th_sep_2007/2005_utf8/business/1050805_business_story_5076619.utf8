 Cheap PC with Intel outside

 New Delhi, Aug. 4: Branded PCs are today available for less than Rs 10,000. But there?s a caveat: if you want Microsoft software and Intel chips in the computer, perish the thought.

 No problem, you have Linux, the open sources software, and hardware from local Taiwanese companies to run the system that isn?t hard on the pocket. The cost of PCs in India have fallen sharply because of a concertina of tax and duty reliefs that the government has provided to the hardware and software industry over the past few years.

 Union communications minister Dayanidhi Maran is shuttling between Chennai, Delhi and Calcutta to launch a slew of low-cost PCs. Maran launched a low-cost PC at Chennai early this week and today showcased it to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and chairperson of the National Advisory Council Sonia Gandhi. He will inaugurate Xenitis group?s manufacturing facility in Calcutta tomorrow. Xenitis is the first manufacturer to launch PCs at Rs 9,790.

 ?It is a major milestone in achieving the national objective of taking the PC to the grassroots level in India,? he said. However, Maran seems to have failed to persuade the leading software and hardware vendors to join his initiative to boost PC penetration. 

 Intel strongly contests the charge and argues the final pricing of the computer is decided by vendors like HCL and HP. Early this week, HCL launched a personal computer for Rs 9,900. The computer is built on a little known processor brand called VIA and does not have a Windows operating system. It runs on Linux. 

 The Xenitis group offers Intel processor but not the Windows software. Technical experts scoff at the system offered in these two PCs but also point out the unrealistic pricing by brands like Intel and Microsoft. 

 According to IT department officials, ?Multinationals ignored Maran?s plea to bring down the cost of equipment and software that go into a PC. He found it not only embarrassing but a major hurdle in his target to increase the broadband (internet) penetration.?

 An Intel spokesperson denied this. ?This is not true; we are only the original equipment manufacturer. The pricing is decided by vendors.?

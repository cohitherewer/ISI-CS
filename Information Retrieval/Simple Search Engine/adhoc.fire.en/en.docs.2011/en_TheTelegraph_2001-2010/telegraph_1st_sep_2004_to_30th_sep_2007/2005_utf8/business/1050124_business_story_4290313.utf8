 The purse of long life

 Chandralekha Tulal looks at a problem that every person faces at some point of time 

 In 1965, Andr? Fran?ois Raffray, a lawyer in the southern French city of Arles, made a deal with a 90-year-old local woman. In a contract relatively common in France, he agreed to pay her an income for the rest of her life in exchange for inheriting her house upon her death.

 Unfortunately for Raffray, the woman was Jeanne Calment, who went on to win the distinction of being the longest-lived person in the world at 122 years. She outlived the luckless Raffray who paid more than the value of the house before predeceasing her.

 A financial planner still chuckles about the time a soon-to-retire couple told her they were buying a new car-the last new car they ever expected to buy. Their last car? recalls the planner. Theyll likely live long enough to go through four or five cars in retirement!

 They call it the ?longevity risk? ? the risk of how many more years you are going to live based on your current age.

 The Oasis report, a study commissioned by the ministry of social justice and empowerment, says that life expectancy in India is improving. Many people can expect to live for about two decades after retirement. The report also suggests that it is not unlikely that many more people will live beyond the age of 80.

 Forget the averages ? if you want to estimate your longevity risk, just put a search on any popular search engine for ?life expectancy calculator?. The tests will ask you a bundle of questions and estimate your life expectancy based on the information you provide.

 If you weigh too much, smoke, have high blood pressure and cholesterol levels or any other health worry signs, the test will reduce your expectancy below the averages. Again, if you exercise, eat right, have a relaxed personality and have no family history of cancer or heart disease, the tests will increase your expectancy above the averages.

 While most of us recognise that people, on average, are living longer these days, few of us grasp how much longer and the financial impact that increased life expectancy will have on their retirement plans.

 Increasingly, life after retirement means preparing for two decades or more. And after 35 years of a vibrant, fulfilled working life in which you have probably owned a house, funded your childrens higher studies, and financed their weddings, you dont want to enter your retired years in a state of financial anxiety with the prospect of penury in the final years.

 Its comforting to think that the kids will take care of you in your old age, but it may be disconcerting to know that if you live to be 90, your children may be approaching 70 themselves. Also, in the age of the nuclear families, you may well find that you have only yourself to turn to once youve retired.

 If you think that your provident fund and pension will be enough, brace yourself for a shock. Your pension fund or Employees Provident Fund will replenish only a percentage of your pre-retirement income. Thanks to restrictive investment regulations, these retirement funds do not grow at a rate good enough to give you a decent nest egg.

 So once you stop working, it won?t be long before inflation catches up with the growth of these savings, devours it and reduces your purchasing power to a pittance. This again brings to the fore the need for a vibrant private pension market within the country.

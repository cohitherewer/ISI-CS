 Air Sahara wants more flights to UK 

 New Delhi, March 10 (PTI): Leading private carrier Air Sahara today expressed hope that it would get more landing slots in the UK by this winter and said it would take a final decision on the acquisition of the wide-bodied aircraft for long-haul international operations soon.

 ?The government has assured us that we will be given seven flights to the UK by winter,? airline?s chief executive Rono J. Dutta told reporters here while unveiling a new Boeing 737-400 inducted into its fleet.

 Dutta announced that the airline would begin its international operations, including that to Gatwick, by July this year.

 He also expressed ?unhappiness? at being given only two slots to the UK in comparison with its rival Jet Airways, which has got the rights to fly to Heathrow everyday.

 The airline, which has recently been allowed to operate in Southeast Asia and two flights a week to Gatwick in the UK, was looking at A-330 and A-340 from Airbus Industries and B-777s and B-737s from Boeing for its long-haul operations, he said.

 He said the company was planning to acquire five new aircraft for its domestic operations in the next 2-3 months, one of which ? the Boeing 737-400 ? was delivered last week.

 The five planes would comprise four new generation aircraft and a ?classic? one.

 Besides, Air Sahara was planning to acquire three wide-bodied aircraft for its international operations, he said.

 Keeping in mind its international operations, Air Sahara also unveiled its new colours to give the airline a distinct identity.

 The colours of Air Sahara have been changed to orange, white, green and blue from the earlier red, white and blue.

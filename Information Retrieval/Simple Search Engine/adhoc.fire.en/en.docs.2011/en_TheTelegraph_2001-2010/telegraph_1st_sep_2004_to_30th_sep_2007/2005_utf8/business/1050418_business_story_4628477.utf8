 Oil firms to control jet fuel facility

 New Delhi, April 17: The petroleum ministry has made it clear to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) that the jet refuelling infrastructure at the country?s airports belongs to the public sector oil companies and cannot be taken over by AAI.

 Petroleum secretary S. C. Tripathi told The Telegraph that the public sector oil companies have set up the facilities for dispensing aviation turbine fuel to the airliners and these assets cannot be handed over unless there is a cabinet decision to this effect. He said the petroleum ministry has in a recent intimation made its view clear on the issue.

 AAI had, in a rather ham-fisted move, asked the public sector oil companies to hand over these assets, citing the recommendations of the Naresh Chandra committee in its support. 

 The report had come out in favour of privatising aviation turbine fuel sales to bring down the cost of jet fuel for airlines. 

 Airlines have been cribbing that jet fuel costs more in India than in other countries as a result of which their cost of operations are higher.

 Private companies such as Reliance Industries and Essar have been eyeing the aviation turbine fuel market and are keen to get a breakthrough into this lucrative business segment, which is controlled by the public sector companies ? Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum.

 However, the flip side of the coin is that public sector oil companies are forced to sell LPG and kerosene at highly subsidised rates and have even been asked to hold the price of petrol and diesel in the face of skyrocketing crude prices. 

 Aviation turbine fuel, which is sold at international prices, helps them to recoup part of their losses and any attempt to erode this market share will only weaken the public sector oil companies further. 

 Indian Oil Corporation, for instance, has for the financial year ended March 31, 2005 seen its earnings plunge by Rs 8,400 crore as it had to sell LPG, kerosene, and even petrol and diesel below international market prices. 

 IOC chairman Sarthak Behuria said the company had lost Rs 7,332 crore on the sales of kerosene and LPG at subsidised rates. Under-recoveries on petrol and diesel added up to Rs 1100 crore. 

 Another reason for higher prices of petroleum products in India is the higher level of taxes levied on these products. In a country, which is notorious for income tax evasion, the proportion of revenue collected through indirect taxes is much higher than advanced countries. 

 Petroleum products such as aviation turbine fuel form important sources of such indirect tax collection and the government cannot let go of such a reliable source of revenue.

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: State-run insurers today announced the formation of a committee to expedite settlements of the torrent of claims coming from flood-hit Maharashtra. 

 Claims have been pouring in for the insurance companies in the aftermath of the deluge caused by torrential rains that lashed Mumbai and parts of Maharashtra since Tuesday, last week. 

 M. Ramadoss, chairman and managing director, Oriental Insurance, said: We have received around 2,200 claims amounting to an estimated loss of around Rs 400-500 crore across industries ? motor, godowns, shops, warehouses and households.

 We are receiving claims where all necessary documents supporting the policyholder are washed away. Consequently, all four public sector insurers have unanimously agreed to follow a single and simple process for quick settlement of these claims, said Dilip Burman, assistant general manager, National Insurance Company. 

 The Calcutta-based insurer has so far received a total of 1,200 claims for an estimated loss of Rs 400 crore. Of this, nearly 35 claims are over Rs 1 crore. 

 Mumbai-based New India Assurance has till now received 4,674 claims amounting to Rs 300 crore.

 In addition, we are expecting a huge claim from Reliance Industries. Insurers have earlier settled claims whenever there was a calamity or an epidemic. There is no need to panic as the surveyors are doing their jobs. Insurance companies will try and settle it as soon as possible, said Rajendra Beri, chairman, New India Assurance. 

 Private insurance company, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, has received around 1,000 claims amounting to approximately Rs 100-125 crore. 

 According to Rakesh Jain, chief financial officer, ICICI Lombard, most of the claims were from the retail segment. These include motor, household, personal accident and shopkeeper insurance. 

 On the industrial front, maximum claims have been made for stocks lying in godowns and on account of flood affecting the buildings, plant and machinery. 

 On Saturday, Maharashtra chief minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh, had met senior officials of public and private sector insurers urging them to speed up settlement of claims.

 Insurance companies, however, say that they are unable to conduct proper surveys due to heavy waterlogging. In many cases, surveyors cannot reach the spot of incident. They are also complaining about a shortage of surveyors. 

 According to the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA) guidelines, all insurers are mandated to appoint surveyors if the claim amount exceeds Rs 20,000. 

 So, insurers are contemplating to take up this matter with the regulator, asking it to relax the cap to a minimum of Rs 50,000.

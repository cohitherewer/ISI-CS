 State Bank in buy mode

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: The State Bank of India today said it would launch an overseas expansion drive in the next six to eight weeks. We are looking at acquiring two banks in Asia and Africa. Their asset size will be medium to small, SBI chairman and managing director A.K. Purwar told reporters on the sidelines of a conference.

 The countrys largest private sector bank, accounting for a quarter of all banking transactions, has been aggressively searching for overseas small and medium-sized banks. 

 Talking about raising preference capital for the bank, he said, We are waiting for the government notification.

 Earlier this month, SBI had said it plans to tap markets with a subordinate debt of up to Rs 3,000 crore under the Tier-II capital. This will fund its overseas expansions and meet forex requirements.

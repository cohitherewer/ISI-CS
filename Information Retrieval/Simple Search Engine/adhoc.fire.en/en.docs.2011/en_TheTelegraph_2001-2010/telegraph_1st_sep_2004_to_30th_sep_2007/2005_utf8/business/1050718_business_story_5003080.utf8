The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Gail keen to sell GSPC gas

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Banerjee: Aiming high

 Calcutta, July 17: Gail (India) Ltd has offered to market gas from Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation?s (GSPC) block in the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin.

 Gail chairman and managing director Proshanto Banerjee said the company was willing to transport and market gas from the KG-1 block, which is said to have 20 trillion cubic metre of reserves.

 At present, the company has a regional pipeline network from the KG basin to transport the Raava gas. The regional network in Andhra Pradesh is about 730-km-long and services various industries there. However, the GSPC find will require a bigger pipeline grid.

 The details of the network and the investment required will be known only after the exact volume of recoverable reserves was ascertained, Banerjee told The Telegraph.

 The discovery, said to be the largest so far, is yet to be certified by an independent agency like DeGolyer amp; MacNaughton (D amp;M). The directorate of hydrocarbon (DGH) has also not confirmed the claim till now.

 Gail had embarked on a plan to build a national gas grid in the country. As part of the project, it had proposed to build a pipeline connecting Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh and Uran in Maharastra. The 1,000-km pipeline will take the gas from the KG basin to the lucrative market in the west.

 The project was envisaged keeping in mind the Reliance-Niko giant gas discovery of 2002. However, Reliance nixed the plan and went ahead to lay its own network to market the gas.

 In fact, there is hardly any clarity on the national gas grid at present. It is still at a conceptual stage and the government has not come out with any policy framework to support it.

 It remains to be seen whether GSPC will let Gail do the transportation and marketing.

 Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi, who announced the discovery last month, said the gas will be brought to Gujarat.

 A cross-country pipeline has to be developed to connect the eastern offshore to the western market, including Gujarat.

 Moreover, the gas can be pumped into the Hazira-Vijapur-Jagdishpur pipeline for the northern market as well.

 Gail had also envisaged two more pipelines from Kakinada to Chennai and Calcutta for the southern and eastern market, respectively.

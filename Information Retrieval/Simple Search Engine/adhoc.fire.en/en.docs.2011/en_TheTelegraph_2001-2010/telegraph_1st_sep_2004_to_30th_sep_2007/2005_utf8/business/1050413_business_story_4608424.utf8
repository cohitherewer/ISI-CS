 Industry logs 8% growth in 11 months

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 12: Industry growth in the 11 months of 2004-05 (April-February) continues to be robust at 8.1 per cent despite a sudden stutter in the month of February.

 In February, industry growth plunged to 4.9 per cent from 8.3 per cent in the year-ago period. This was blamed on negative growth in two key infrastructure sectors: mining and electricity.

 However, the blip did not affect the latest index for industrial production (IIP) released, which showed a growth of 8.1 per cent for the April-February period against 6.9 per cent clocked in the corresponding period of the previous fiscal.

 In February, the mining sector showed a negative growth of 2.3 per cent compared with a robust growth of 10.7 per cent in the same month last year.

 The electricity sector showed a negative growth of 0.9 per cent in February against 12.9 per cent in the same month of 2004, which probably explained why manufacturing growth slowed down to 6.2 per cent from 7.6 per cent last year.

 However, except mining, the other two sectors taken into account for the IIP showed a much better year-on-year growth in 2004-05.

 Growth of the mining sector in the first 11 months of 2004-05 slowed down to 4 per cent from 5.3 per cent last year. In the manufacturing sector, the growth was 8.7 per cent in the same period of this fiscal against 7.3 per cent in the year-ago period.

 The electricity sector also grew 5.3 per cent in the April-February period compared with 4.5 per cent in the same period last fiscal.

 Growth in production of basic, intermediate and capital goods suffered the biggest drop in February, but the impact was absorbed by a robust growth in consumer goods.

 The growth in production of basic goods fell to a mere 0.8 per cent in February from 10.3 per cent in the same period last fiscal.

 Growth of capital goods dropped to 4.5 per cent from 27.8 per cent last year.

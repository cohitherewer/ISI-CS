 Aiyar quells Raha exit buzz

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 6: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today said ONGC chairman Subir Raha would not be forced to resign even as he censured director general of hydrocarbons, V. K. Sibal, for his emotional outburst against the chief of the upstream giant.

 Asked to comment on Rahas reported threat to resign, Aiyar said No, I do not want him to go. It was immature of Raha to have suggested such a thing. I have no interest in seeing a competent man like Raha go. 

 It is very unfortunate that Sibal vented his differences with the ONGC chairman through the media, he added.

 The petroleum minister said he had received Rahas letter which raised very pertinent issues. We have taken note of his objections and are giving it a serious consideration.

 Aiyar said he has sought the department of public enterprises views on the issue of whether the number of government directors on a public sector firms board could be raised to four from the present prescribed norm of two. This had been done through a letter on August 29.

 He has also asked the law ministry to explain if a regulator could be appointed on the board of a company under its supervision. These are relevant issues raised by Raha. We are getting them examined with all seriousness, Aiyar added.

 Senior officials had on Monday dismissed as mere speculation reports that the petroleum ministry would move a resolution at the ONGC annual general meeting to foist two directors on the board ?forcing Raha to quit.

 Calcutta, April 27: The jute industry needs to diversify to cut down its dependence on reservation, said Union textile secretary R. Poornalingam at a workshop on the sector.

 ?So far only 5 per cent of jute products come under the diversified category. It should be increased to at least 20 per cent in the next five years,? he said. However, the reservation policy for packaging food grains and sugar will stay and be reviewed annually, he added. 

 The National Jute Board, which will work as a proactive agency for promotion of the sector, will be set up in two to three months, Poornalingam said.

 He added that the Rs 350-crore Jute Technology Mission would be operational within a couple of months.

 Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who had proposed the workshop, said: ?The jute sector?s problems are the state?s problems too. We will urge the Union government to make it mandatory for the sugar industry to pack all its produce in jute sacks instead of 90 per cent. We will not compromise on that. However, the industry has to modernise and diversify to reduce its dependence on reservation,? he said.

 Bhattacharjee also urged the various agencies involved in jute agriculture to set up pilot projects to produce jute seed, which is brought from Maharashtra and Gujarat.

 Labour minister Md Amin was also present. 

 Sanjay Kajaria, director of Hasting Jute Mill, put forward the industry?s view on modernisation and diversification of the sector. He said just about 10 out of 61 mills had so far tried to produce diversified products. He said special thrust is necessary for machinery development, if necessary in collaboration with developed countries. 

 Kajaria added that the law and order situation in jute mill premises should be improved to facilitate modernisation programmes.

 Trade union leaders like Gobinda Guha of Bengal Chatkal Mazdoor Union and INTUC leader Ganesh Sarkar alleged that industry leaders never implement any government policy and hardly take the labour into confidence.

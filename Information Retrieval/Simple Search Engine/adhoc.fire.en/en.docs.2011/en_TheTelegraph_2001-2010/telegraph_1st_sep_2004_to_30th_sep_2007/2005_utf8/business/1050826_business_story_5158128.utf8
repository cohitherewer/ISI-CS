 Emami mulls brand buyouts

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 25: Emami Limited is eyeing foreign and domestic brands in the hair and skin care segments.

 The city-based FMCG company will use its free cash reserves of Rs 47 crore for the purpose, Emami chairman R. S. Agarwal said at the companys annual general meeting.

 We are looking for brands in the US and the UK. We are also eyeing domestic brands, said Agarwal.

 The company also plans to diversify into cultivation of jatropha, which is being used to produce bio-fuel by oil companies. We are in talks with several multinational companies for technological tie-ups or joint venture, said Agarwal.

 We had applied to the Bengal government for 300 acres, of which 50 acres had been allotted in a place near Bolpur in Birbhum district, he said. The company will make an investment of Rs 200-300 crore in the project.

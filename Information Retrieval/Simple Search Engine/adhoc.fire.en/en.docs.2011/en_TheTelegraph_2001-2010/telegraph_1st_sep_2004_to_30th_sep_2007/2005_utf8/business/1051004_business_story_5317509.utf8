 SpiceJet reaps early bird reward 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Oct. 3: SpiceJet is reaping rewards in the first year of operations itself. 

 In its new avatar as a low-cost airline, SpiceJet has proved that low operating costs and slim margins can bring in profits, providing hope to many players who are mulling an entry into the domestic civil aviation segment in the coming months.

 SpiceJets first-quarter operating revenue stood at Rs 57.26 crore. The company spent Rs 57.15 crore, which leaves a small operating profit, a rare phenomena in the first quarter for low-cost airlines globally. It has reduced losses to Rs 10 crore from Rs 23.7 crore in the previous quarter.

 SpiceJet is the new name for Royal Airways. S.K. Modi and Lufthansa had floated ModiLuft in the nineties. After Lufthansa exited, Modi roped in some NRIs who later took control of the company and changed its name to Royal Airways. 

 Air Deccan, which pioneered the no-frills airline concept in India, is already making profits and is expected to come out with a maiden offer by the end of 2005-06.

 GoAir ? Jeh Wadias airline that will start operations by October 30 ? is following the same model. So will Paramount Airways, the Coimbatore-headquartered airline. 

 Airlines like SpiceJet are betting on domestic and international passenger traffic to grow 20-to-25 per cent a year as the government and the private sector invest Rs 90,000 crore over five years, including doubling the number of civilian passenger planes to 400 from 180.

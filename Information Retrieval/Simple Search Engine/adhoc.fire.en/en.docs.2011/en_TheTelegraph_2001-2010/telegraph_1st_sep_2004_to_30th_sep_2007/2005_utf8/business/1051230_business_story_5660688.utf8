 The RBI injected Rs 26,890 crore through the repo (repurchase) auction under its liquidity adjustment facility, an official said here and added that the apex bank had yesterday infused Rs 26,685 crore through the same mechanism.

 Also, after selling $5.1 billion of foreign exchange to the State Bank of India over two days, the central bank today sold foreign exchange worth $1.972 billion to help the bank meet its IMD redemption dues, the official said.

 For the foreign exchange of $5.1 billion, the largest commercial bank in the country had paid Rs 23,044.87 crore.

 Meanwhile, State Bank chairman A.K. Purwar said the bank did not raise any fresh money for IMD redemption and only the money that was maturing was used for the purpose.

 The money retained will carry current interest rates that is Libor plus 25-30 basis points according to RBI guidelines, Purwar said.

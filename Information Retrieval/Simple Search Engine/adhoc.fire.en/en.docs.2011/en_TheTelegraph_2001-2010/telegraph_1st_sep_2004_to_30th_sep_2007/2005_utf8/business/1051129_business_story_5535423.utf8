 Merck prescribes job-cut pill

 Clark: Tough time

 Washington, Nov. 28 (Agencies): Merck and Co, the troubled American drug firm, today announced a sweeping restructuring plan that will see the loss of 7000 jobs or 11 per cent of its worldwide workforce as well as closure or sale of five of its 31 manufacturing plants.

 The company said this plan will help it book a pretax savings of $3.5-4 billions between 2006 and 2010.

 The New Jersey-based company said the job cuts will take place by the end of 2008 and about one half of them will be in the US.

 The announcement comes at a time when Merck is under pressure from investors and analysts to cut costs and jobs.

 It is facing the potential loss of patent protection for its top selling cholesterol lowering drug Zocor ? $5 billions in sales ? next year, besides thousands of liability suits from Vioxx, the recalled painkiller. The company will face more problems in 2006, when Zocor loses its patent protection and will be open to competition from much cheaper generic copies.

 Since becoming chief executive in May, Richard T. Clark, who has spent his career at Merck and is known as a cost cutter, has promised to streamline the companys operations, and Merck has already been quietly trimming its 62,000-person work force. In the third quarter, the company said it spent $80 million on ongoing global position eliminations.

 On Saturday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Merck had briefed its board on the final details of its planned cuts, including several plant closings. 

 Merck, the Journal had pointed out, also faces the prospect of yet another of its popular drugs, Fosomax, losing its patent years earlier than expected in 2008.

 Fosamax was supposed to be Mercks second biggest seller and is used in the treatment of osteoporosis.

 According to analysts dearth of new drugs is hurting Merck most.

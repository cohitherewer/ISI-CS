 Mumbai, Feb. 15: GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals may buy back shares from the market, managing director S. Kalyanasundaram said today. 

 The parent would like to hold at least a majority stake and there are no plans to de-list the domestic company, he added. The parent holds around 49 per cent in the company.

 The company has posted a 93.3 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 333.09 crore for the year ended December 31, 2004, against Rs 172.23 crore in the corresponding previous period.

 Total income grew to Rs 1,426.78 crore against Rs 1,155.95 crore, the company told the Bombay Stock Exchange today.

 Net profit for the fourth quarter stood at Rs 23.63 crore against Rs 14.64 crore in the year-ago period. Total income rose to Rs 294.23 crore. 

 The company?s net profit before exceptional items for the year rose 16 per cent to Rs 266 crore from Rs 181.86 crore in 2003. 

 The exceptional items included the sale of a plot at Worli, costs of separation and other retirement benefits for employees at the Mysore and Bangalore factories.

 The board has recommended a dividend of Rs 13 per share and a special additional one-time dividend of Rs 11 per share.

 The company decided to go for the the additional one-time dividend based on an improving operating margin for the past three years, a tight working capital management and steady cash inflows from sale of properties. 

 If approved by shareholders, the special additional one-time dividend will absorb Rs 108.59 crore, inclusive of the dividend distribution tax.

 The company has identified a four-pronged strategy to strengthen its presence in the country. A key element of this gameplan is an ?India-specific strategy? to modernise its portfolio. 

 Kalyanasundaram said this will include both in-licensing or launching products whose patents have expired. Analysts tracking the industry say this is a strategy which is different from that followed by its parent.

 Glaxo will soon enter the growing market segment of diabetes and cardiovascular drugs. In 2004, net sales of the companys pharmaceutical business grew 8.7 per cent against an industry growth of 6.4 per cent. This was largely due to the company?s focus on aggressive sales and marketing efforts in select major brands.

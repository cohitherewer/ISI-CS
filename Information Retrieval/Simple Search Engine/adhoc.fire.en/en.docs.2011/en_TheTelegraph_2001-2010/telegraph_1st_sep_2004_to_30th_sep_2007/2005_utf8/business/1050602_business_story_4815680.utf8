 Calcutta, June 1: Bose Corporation plans to increase its retail outlets in India from nine to 16 by March 2007.

 Ratish Pandey, general manager of Bose Corporation India, said, ?We plan to expand the home audio vision retail outlets to 12 by March 2006 and 16 by March 2007. This will help us cover the non-metro cities and expand our footprint.?

 Bose also plans to set up a store in Calcutta and is scouting for a suitable location.

 The Indian operations of the company has registered over 60 per cent year-on-year growth for the last three to four years. ?This is the fastest growing market for the group and will continue to remain so for the next few years,? added Pandey.

 The company does not have a distribution channel and follows the ?direct-to-customer? approach to sell its products.

 ?We are also ramping up the Indian operations,? Pandey said. ?We will set up the website for customer interaction and also create back-end support network for locations where we plan to expand.?

 The retail division of the company mainly develops products catering to premium customers and has no plans to enter the mass segment.

 ?India is also a hub for our software support,? said Pandey. ?The Bose Technology Centre works on embedded software and supports futuristic audio products for the global range. We plan to ramp up the development centre from 16 engineers to 40 by March 2006.?

 The company is working on the commercial launch of the Bose suspension system, which was on test run since August last year. ?We are looking for a tie-up with an US-based automotive major for the commercial launch,? Pandey added.

 Bose today launched the next generation acoustic waveguide speaker that uses proprietary signal processing to improve instrument clarity and definition at all listening levels. The Bose Wave Music System is priced at Rs 29,900.

 The system has a built-in antenna and can be preset at frequencies for six FM and AM channels along with an MP3 CD player. It also has in-built amplifiers and speakers and can be integrated with other Bose products and TV, VCR, DVD player or a computer.

 Bose Corporation India started its operations in early 1996 with initial focus on design and installation of professional sound systems in public places and started retail operations in 1998 by adopting a ?direct-to-customer? approach.

 Bose Corporation, founded by Amar G. Bose, professor of electronic engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US, is a privately held company with six business segments. 

 The company has 18 subsidiaries and eight manufacturing units across the globe

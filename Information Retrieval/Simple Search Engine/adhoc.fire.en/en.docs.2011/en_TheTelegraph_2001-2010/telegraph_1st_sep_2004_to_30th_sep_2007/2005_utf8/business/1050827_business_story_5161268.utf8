 Chennai, Aug. 26: Royal Enfield, the makers of the Bullet motorcycles, is developing a ?completely new engine platform?. 

 The company is working on an ?integrated engine? that will be more fuel-efficient and cost-effective, CEO R.L. Ravichandran said at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Chennai-based firm.

 Royal Enfield, which has been focusing on a niche market of motorcycles, had gone for new products with a ?lean burn engine? in 1998, he said. That engine not only met stringent emission norms for exports to the West but also offered more power and fuel economy, he added. The Bullet Machismo and the Thunderbird ? the first cruiser bike ? were launched with that engine.

 The new integrated engine taking shape at the company?s Thiruvottiyur factory will not only drive its popular cruiser model in the next six months but also its 500 cc export model, said Ravichandran. 

 The company was also redesigning the body of its vehicles to make them lighter by 15 kg, he said.

 He also launched the Bullet Electra-55 with the 5-speed gearbox and an advanced model of the Thunderbird as part of the celebrations. 

 In 1994, the Delhi-based Eicher group had acquired the company and had changed the name to Royal Enfield Motors Limited.

 The company sold 32,000 bikes in the year ended March 31, 2004 and aimed to sell 40,000 vehicles this year, Ravichandran said.

 ?The new models will give us the additional volume,? he added.

 ?We want to continue to play a big role in the niche market,? he said, adding that the 500-cc bike is mainly for exports while the 350 cc is for the domestic market.

 While the UK, the US and Germany are the main export markets for Royal Enfield, the Saarc countries are also showing interest in our bikes of late, said Ravichandran. 

 Recently, the company exported a consignment of motorcycles to the Sri Lankan Special Airforce Squad, he added.

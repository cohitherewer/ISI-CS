 Reward for power board

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Tall feat

 Calcutta, July 5: The West Bengal State Electricity Board (WBSEB) has received an incentive of Rs 302.76 crore from the Centre for reducing losses in 2003-04.

 Under the governments Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme (APDRP), any SEB which cuts its losses is eligible for a grant of 50 per cent of the amount reduced.

 WBSEB is the only state-run utility which has received such a large amount as an incentive grant. The APDRP programme was introduced by the Union power ministry in 2001-02.

 WBSEB has been able to cut losses worth Rs 605 crore in 2003-04. The grant order was issued today from Delhi. The board officials took effective steps to drastically reduce the losses. The incentive will boost our efficiency, state power minister Mrinal Banerjee said.

 WBSEB secretary S.K. Gupta said the board is looking at a reduction of Rs 500-600 crore of losses in 2004-05 as well.

 We cannot state the final figure for 2004-05 as the accounts have not yet been finalised. But it will be in that region only, he added.

 The power minister said the incentive will be used to further the power sector reforms. We have not yet decided on the project where the funds will be used, Banerjee added.

 In 2004-05, WBSEB has garnered revenues worth Rs 4,800 crore and has achieved an operational surplus of Rs 270 crore. In 2003-04, the board had made an operational surplus of Rs 38 crore.

 In the current financial year, WBSEB has set a revenue target of Rs 5,500 crore. It is also confident of increasing the operating surplus substantially this year.

 The board is on the right path and is likely to achieve the targeted revenues, Banerjee added.

 The board has also undertaken a restructuring exercise under the second phase of PSU recast initiated by the Bengal government. The Department for International Development of the UK and multilateral funding agencies like ADB are expected to finance the exercise.

 The Bengal government has floated a global tender inviting consultants, who will work out the restructuring formula for the board.

 Paris, Dec. 5 (Reuters): China signed a deal on Monday to buy 150 single-aisle passenger jets from Airbus worth nearly $10 billion at list prices in a boost for the European planemaker in its battle with US rival Boeing.

 The agreement on the A320 jets was signed during a visit to France by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin told a news conference. The A320 family comprises four aircraft capable of seating 107 to 185 passengers and the 150 planes are worth around $9.7 billion at list prices.

 China also signed an agreement with Eurocopter, the worlds largest civilian helicopter maker, to co-develop a 6-tonne helicopter.

 Both Airbus and Eurocopter are subsidiaries of European aerospace firm EADS.

 In bilateral agreements with France, China also signed a 150-million euro ($176-million) deal for construction of its high-speed Shitai railway link, and it ordered a satellite from telecom equipment maker Alcatel Alenia Space.

 This visit comes at an exceptional time in relations between our two countries, Villepin said after a signing ceremony and talks with Wen, who also met President Jacques Chirac.

 French media commentators see the deals partly as a reward for improved political ties with France, which is campaigning with Germany for the EU to drop an embargo on arms sales to China.

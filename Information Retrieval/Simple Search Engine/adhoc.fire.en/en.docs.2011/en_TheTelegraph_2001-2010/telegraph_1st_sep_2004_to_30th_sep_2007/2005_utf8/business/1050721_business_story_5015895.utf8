 ?We are delighted to report a strong set of results in our first full quarter as a public company. We are reaping the benefits of our leadership and service excellence in one of the world?s most exciting aviation markets,? chairman Naresh Goyal said.

 The airline achieved a seat factor of 75.2 per cent compared with 69.0 per cent in the corresponding previous quarter.

 The seat factor in international operations was 62 per cent (66 per cent for June 2005).

 Jet Airways said it managed to keep the break-even seat factor of 64.8 per cent, despite a significant increase in fuel prices.

 Jet started flights to more international destinations, including Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and London, last month.

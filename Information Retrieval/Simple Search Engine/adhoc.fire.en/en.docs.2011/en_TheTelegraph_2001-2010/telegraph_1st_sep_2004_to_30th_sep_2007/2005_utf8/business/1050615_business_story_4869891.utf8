 Mumbai, June 14: Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) today announced a joint venture with International Truck and Engine Corporation of the US under which it will manufacture trucks and buses ? an uncharted area for it.

 The leader in tractor and utility vehicles will spin off its light commercial vehicle business into the venture, which will be owned 51 per cent by the Mahindras and 49 per cent by International Truck Corp.

 If all goes to plan, trucks and buses could roll off the Mahindra assembly line from 2007. The annual capacity could be 50,000 light, medium and heavy commercial vehicles, which will be sold at home and in overseas markets.

 The venture, which will cost Rs 400 crore to get going, is to be called Mahindra International Pvt Ltd. Components from India will be supplied to the US firm, besides engineering services for the design and development of trucks and buses for the companys global operations.

 International Truck, a subsidiary of the $9.7-billion Navistar International Corporation, is an industry leader in medium, heavy trucks and buses in North America.

 Under the agreement signed today, the US auto major will choose the vehicles to be launched in India, oversee design, development and sourcing of spares. The Mahindras will undertake manufacturing on a contract basis, based on the requirement of the joint venture.

 Pawan Goenka, chief operating officer of M amp;Ms automotive division, said the project cost of Rs 400 crore will take care of capacity addition, tooling and design.

 M amp;M vice-chairman and managing director Anand Mahindra said the alliance gives his company, which has been manufacturing commercial vehicles of up to 7.5 tonnes so far, the know-how to offer a much wider range.

 The tie-up with International Truck follows the joint venture the Mahindras forged with Renault to manufacture and sell the Logan from 2007. 

 We will be a significant player in every segment of automobiles, an official said.

 Goenka said there was a big market potential for commercial vehicles, which will be driven by strong growth and the increased pace of infrastructure development. 

 He cited recent trends to show buyers preferred medium and heavy commercial vehicles, which have grabbed two-thirds of the market. By contrast, sales of light commercial vehicles had dropped.

 Deepak T. Kapur, president of International Truck, said there is a synergy between the two companies. His firm will harness India as a low-cost sourcing base. Mahindra said the venture symbolised M amp;Ms leap across the entire value chain of the automotive business.

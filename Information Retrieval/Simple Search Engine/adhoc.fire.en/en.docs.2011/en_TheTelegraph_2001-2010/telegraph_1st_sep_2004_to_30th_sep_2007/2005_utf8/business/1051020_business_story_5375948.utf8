 The winner

 Mumbai, Oct. 19: Maruti Suzuki has topped the JD Power Asia Pacific survey on customer satisfaction for the sixth consecutive year.

 Mahindra amp; Mahindra emerged as the most improved name with 702 points, overtaking the Tatas and Fiat, who figured at the end of the list of four-wheeler manufacturers in the survey at 658 points and 654 points respectively.

 Marutis consistent performance in the study over the past several years has resulted in a steady increase in the percentage of its customers who say they intend to remain loyal to the brand, said Mohit Arora, India director at JD Power Asia Pacific.

 JD Power and Associates is a business unit of Mc-Graw-Hill Companies and specialises in market research, forecasting, consulting, training and customer satisfaction.

 Competition increased in the last 18 months as new vehicle models were introduced almost every alternate month, with the Indian car market crossing the 1-million mark.

 Manufacturers in India have realised that investing in customer satisfaction not only yields greater advocacy and loyalty for their brands, but also creates positive word-of-mouth recommendations that drive first-time sales of their products, Arora said.

 Maruti has secured 823 points on a scale of 900, with the industry average pegged at 761. Rival Hyundai scored 739 and Ford and Honda registered 735 and 723 points respectively.

 Toyota, Chevrolet, Opel and Skoda came close to one another with 714, 712 and 709 and 706 points respectively.

 According to the study, operational costs of new vehicles have risen 11 per cent and 15 per cent for petrol and diesel vehicles, respectively, from 2004. 

 Diesel vehicle owners continue to report lower overall operating cost per km than petrol vehicle owners, largely due to lower fuel costs.

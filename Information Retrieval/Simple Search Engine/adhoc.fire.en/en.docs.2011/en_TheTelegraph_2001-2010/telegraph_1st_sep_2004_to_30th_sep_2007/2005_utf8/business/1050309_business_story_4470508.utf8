 VW growth dream runs on rejig fuel

 Wolfsburg, Germany, March 8 (Reuters): Volkswagen AG said it expects a weak first quarter but higher 2005 operating earnings as it pins its hopes on the success of a restructuring programme and rejuvenated model line.

 The outlook for the first quarter sent VW?s shares down 2.3 per cent to 36.47 euros, making them the leading decliner on the blue-chip DAX.

 ?Operating profit after special items will improve year-on-year in 2005, although the extent of this improvement depends on external factors that cannot be predicted at present,? Europe?s largest carmaker said on Tuesday.

 Nevertheless, first-quarter operating profit as in the previous year ?will not be satisfactory?, VW said.

 Michael Raab, analyst at Sal Oppenheim, said: ?The wording they have used is almost tantamount to a profit warning for first quarter and there were obviously a couple people out there who were playing Volkswagen as a restructuring story.?

 First quarter operating profit fell 46 per cent to 329 million euros ($434.8 million) in 2004, but the figure could be restated due to a change in accounting rules.

 Chief executive Bernd Pischetsrieder told a news conference he was confident that the group would reach its ForMotion 2005 savings target of 3.1 billion euros.

 The efficiency programme is critical due to extremely difficult market conditions around the world.

 ?In the face of growing price pressure, continuing unfavourable exchange rates and uncertainty about developments in the costs of raw materials, especially steel, the competitive situation in our industry will be further exacerbated,? he said.

 Deliveries to customers declined 0.5 per cent to roughly 687,000 vehicles in the first two months of the year, dragged down by a drop in China, VW?s most important foreign market. The company said it expects an improvement in sales later in the year thanks in part to this month?s launch of its popular Jetta compact saloon in the United States and Passat mid-sized saloon in Europe.

 Investor hopes for a turnaround have also been boosted by the arrival of former Chrysler manager Wolfgang Bernhard, who will take over responsibility for the VW Brand Group ?long before? January 2006, Pischetsrieder said.

 This cannot come too soon, since the division swung to a 2004 operating loss of 44 million euros from a 486 million euro profit in 2003.

 Early in January, VW chief financial officer Hans Dieter Poetsch had forecast an improved operating profit for 2005 and a clear rise the following year, when he said earnings should improve by a few billion euros.

 Already struggling with stagnation in the world?s major car markets, European auto companies have had to cope with the added burdens of high steel prices, a strong euro and a continued erosion in pricing power.

 ?We believe that the situation will remain difficult in the key automobile markets, such as Germany, China and the USA,? Pischetsrieder said.

 Pro rata operating profit at its China joint ventures declined by 60 per cent to just 222 million euros last year, while the group?s North American operating loss widened to 907 million euros from 168 million euros in 2003.

 ?We are working intensively to reorient the Volkswagen group in China, to maintain our market leadership and to profit more clearly from the growing demand in China,? the VW CEO said.

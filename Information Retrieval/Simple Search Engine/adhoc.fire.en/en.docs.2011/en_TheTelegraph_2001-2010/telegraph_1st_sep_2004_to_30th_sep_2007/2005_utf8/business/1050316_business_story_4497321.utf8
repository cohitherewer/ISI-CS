 Car sales hit slow lane in February

 New Delhi, March 15: The rising curve of passenger car sales took a dip in the month of February as consumers waited for the budget to lower car prices by reducing the excise duty. 

 The budget on February 28, however, failed to lower the excise duty on cars from the current level of 24 per cent to 16 per cent, in line with that imposed on trucks and bikes.

 Analysts feel that in February buyers had held back car purchases, in anticipation of a duty cut. But since the finance minister has asked car companies to wait for some more time for a duty cut, it may come before the next budget. 

 Industry data showed today that India?s domestic car sales fell 4.2 per cent in the year through February. 

 Car sales in February fell to 62,072 units from 64,819 in the same month of 2004, said a statement from the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM). 

 In February, monthly sales of nine out of 11 carmakers dropped. 

 Only Tata Motors Ltd, India?s No. 2 producer of cars, reported a higher sales of 12,671 units, up 29.8 per cent from the previous year. 

 Car sales of Hindustan Motors were flat at 1,363 units.

 For the country?s leading producer of passenger cars ? Maruti ? sales dropped to 33,505 units in February from 34,084 in the corresponding month last year. Its total vehicle sales, including vans, grew 3.2 per cent. 

 However, overall car sales have been rising. The industry data shows that passenger car sales grew by 17.68 per cent to touch 7,30,425 units during the April to February period against 6,20,705 units during the corresponding previous period. 

 During the period under review, utility vehicles (UVs) sales rose by 19.80 per cent to 1,55,480 units against 1,29,782 units in the year-ago period. 

 The cumulative growth of overall passenger vehicles during this period was 17.54 per cent. 

 The two-wheeler segment grew by 15.97 per cent during April-February with 56,68,318 units sold against 48,87,698 in the year-ago period. Motorcycles grew at 19.11 per cent, scooters at 5.21 per cent and mopeds at 4.28 per cent. 

 Three-wheeler sales stood at 2,77,669 units against 2,54,729, showing a growth of 9 per cent. Goods carriers grew by 25.64 per cent during this period.

 Medium and heavy commercial vehicles continued to grow and posted a sales growth of 23.59 per cent to touch 1,74,911 units in the April to February period against 1,41,529 units last year.

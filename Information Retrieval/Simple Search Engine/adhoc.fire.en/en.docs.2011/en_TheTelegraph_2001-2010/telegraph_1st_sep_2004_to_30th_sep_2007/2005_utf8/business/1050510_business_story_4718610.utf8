 Essar in oil hunt deal with Myanmar

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 9: Essar Oil has signed a production sharing contract with the government of Myanmar for oil exploration in two blocks ? one onshore and the other offshore in the western region of Rakhine. 

 Essar is the first foreign company to sign an onshore oil and gas production agreement with Myanmar since the junta announced in early March that all onshore blocks would in future be reserved for the state energy enterprise. 

 Its bid for the two contiguous blocks in the offshore (Block A2) area and the adjoining land (Block L) was made after detailed study of geo-scientific data at the Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise (MOGE) office in January 2005.

 The blocks are located between proven gas blocks and aligned along the regional corridor of gas discoveries south of Bangladesh, including the highly productive Sangu Gas field in Bangladesh. The Rakhine coast lies along the eastern side of these blocks, providing favourable logistic support. 

 Essar Oil plans to conduct a feasibility study, which will cover collection of geological, seismic and well drilling data, reprocessing and reinterpretation of old 2D seismic and geological data and geological mapping, modelling and identification of prospects. The feasibility report is expected to be ready in a year.

 The contracts were signed by MOGE managing director U. San Lwin on behalf of the Myanmar government. Essar Oil managing director A. N. Sinha signed the contracts on behalf of the company. 

 Essar Oil officials said Myanmar has huge gas reserves and estimates have shown that the country has over 3 billion barrels of recoverable crude oil reserves.

 Essar Oil, the integrated oil company from the Ruia group, has operations covering the entire value chain of oil exploration to retailing of petroleum products. It is currently setting up a 10.5-million-tonne refinery at Vadinar in Gujarat. 

 The project is set to start commercial operations in the third quarter of 2006. Apart from the refinery, Essar Oil is now focussing on setting up more retail outlets. 

 While the company has so far commissioned around 506 retail outlets across the country, it plans to set up 2500 by mid 2006, which will be increased to 5000 by 2008.

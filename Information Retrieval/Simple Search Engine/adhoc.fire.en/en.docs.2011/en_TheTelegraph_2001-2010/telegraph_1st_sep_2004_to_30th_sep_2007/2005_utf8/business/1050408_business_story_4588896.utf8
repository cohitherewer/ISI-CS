 Flurry of rights issues on cards

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 7: Rights issues are in favour these days with companies looking to raise funds for expansion.

 According to stock research firm Prime Database, Rs 3,616 crore was raised during the last financial year through such issues. Since then, around 14 companies have applied for or have obtained Sebi?s approval to raise Rs 885 crore in this fiscal. 

 There are at least 30 more who are planning to tap this market. These companies are expected to firm up plans soon, Prime said.

 The response to most of the issues last fiscal was good as the offers were made at a discount to the ruling market price, said Prithvi Haldea of Prime Database. Moreover, the response from shareholders was positive, especially during the rally in the secondary market.

 Last fiscal, companies raised Rs 3,616 crore, which was 259 per cent higher than Rs 1,006 crore garnered in the previous fiscal. 

 However, the mobilisation in 2004-05 was still only 29 per cent of the Rs 12,630-crore that was raised in the boom year of 1992-93, Prime added.

 The largest issue was from Sterlite Industries (Rs 1972 crore). ING Vysya Bank, United Breweries, Southern Iron amp; Steel, Karnataka Bank and Bharat Forge had offers over Rs 100 crore.

 Haldea added that turnaround, though marginal, in the fortunes of these rights issues both in numbers and in amount was due to the bullish conditions in the secondary market throughout the whole of 2004-05.

 ?Companies offered shares on rights basis either to expand, diversify or simply to restructure their balance sheets. Moreover, in some cases, promoters raised their stake in the company at a reasonable price,? he said.

 Companies also prefer to meet their fund requirements through preferential allotments of equity. Moreover, many also tapped the overseas market through the FCCB route at attractive rates.

 Some of the companies who have approached the market regulator or have already obtained approval include Bata India, Trent, Lakshmi Vilas Bank and Arvind International.

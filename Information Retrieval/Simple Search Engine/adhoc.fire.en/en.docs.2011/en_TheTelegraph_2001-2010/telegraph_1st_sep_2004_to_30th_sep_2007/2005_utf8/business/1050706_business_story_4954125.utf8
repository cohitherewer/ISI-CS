 Calcutta, July 5: United Bank of India (UBI) is in talks with Exim Bank for setting up a consortium to finance export-oriented units.

 The move is likely to boost the banks export credit, which was Rs 400 crore on March 31, 2005. 

 Talks are at a preliminary stage. We may provide either term loan or working capital or both, said P.K. Gupta, chairman and managing director of UBI.

 He was talking to newspersons on the sidelines of a Banking Conclave organised by Ficci (eastern region).

 UBIs move is in the line with the current trend in the banking industry where most of the banks are tying up with financial institutions which are experts in certain areas of lending.

 Industry experts said such strategic alliances help banks properly utilise their funds. 

 Uco Bank has tied up with Sidbi to provide finances to small and medium enterprises.

 UBI has an alliance with National Small Industries Corporation for financing the small sector. It is also planning a similar tieup with Nabard for agricultural lending.

 Unfolding the banks plans for the current financial year, Gupta said the immediate task would be to wipe out losses. The accumulated loss of the bank in March 2005 was Rs 280 crore.

 We can take further steps once we get rid of this loss. We will look into the possibility of coming up with an initial public offering (IPO) once that is done. The board has not yet discussed the IPO. The proposal has not been put forward to the government as well, he added.

 UBIs capital adequacy ratio now stands at 18 per cent. However, higher CAR means the capital is not being utilised effectively.

 In the first three months of the current fiscal, UBI has registered an incremental growth of Rs 1000 crore in credit and Rs 600 crore in deposit.

 Earlier, he spoke on the theme of the banking conclave ? Banking for Double Digit Growth for Indian Economy. He said the banking system plays a pivotal role in the economy. Public sector banks command 75 per cent of the total deposits and advances in the sector.

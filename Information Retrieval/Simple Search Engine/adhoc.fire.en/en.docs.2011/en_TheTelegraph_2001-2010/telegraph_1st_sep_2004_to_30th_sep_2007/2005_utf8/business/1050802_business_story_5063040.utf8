 HSBC to focus on emerging markets

 London, Aug. 1 (Reuters): Global bank HSBC highlighted its focus on emerging markets on Monday as it reported a 5 per cent rise in first-half profits and reiterated that the UK was its most difficult credit market.

 Pretax profit for the six months ended June 30 rose to $10.64 billion from $10.12 billion in the same period last year, the worlds second-largest bank by market value said in a statement.

 The average estimate of 10 analysts was for a 2.5 per cent fall to $9.87 billion, with a range of between $9.34 billion and $10.52 billion. However, analysts forecasts had been complicated by the introduction of new IFRS accounting rules and three estimates had predicted a profit rise.

 HSBC said income from net lending rose 10 per cent to $16.69 billion, while provisions for bad debts were $537 million higher.

 In an outlook statement, the London-based bank highlighted that the UK was its most difficult credit market amid a cooling housing sector and slower employment growth. 

 Chairman John Bond said the first half figures highlighted HSBCs success in expanding consumer finance in emerging markets. Bond also said the focus on retail and commercial banking would be more important, amid fewer opportunities to generate profits from treasury activities in the current interest rate environment.

 HSBC is the second largest UK bank to update investors on trading, but unlike Lloyds TSB, whose shares dipped last week on higher retail bad debts, HSBC is less exposed to fallout from Britains 1 trillion pound consumer spending spree.

 HSBC, which has operations in 77 countries, is more than a year into a five-year plan to boost growth and is targeting emerging middle classes and growing companies in countries such Brazil, Mexico, South Korea and China.

 HSBCs London-listed shares were up 0.9 per cent at 931 pence, the best performing major UK bank. HSBC has gained 15 per cent over the past year, making it the seventh-best performer among Britains 10 listed banks.

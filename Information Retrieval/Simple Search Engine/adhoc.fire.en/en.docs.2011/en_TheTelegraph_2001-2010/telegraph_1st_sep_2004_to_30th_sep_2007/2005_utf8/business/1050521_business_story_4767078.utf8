 SBI bond issue to raise capital

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 20: State Bank of India (SBI) will raise its tier-II capital by Rs 4,000 crore in the current financial year to meet its growing needs and the standards spelt out in the Basel II norms.

 The bank will issue subordinated bonds to raise the capital.

 Chairman A. K. Purwar said, We may tap the overseas markets to raise our tier-II capital. But a majority amount will be raised in the domestic market. The issue is being discussed at the board level. We have not yet decided on the portion to be raised from the domestic market.

 SBI needs capital to increase its overseas presence. The bank plans to increase its international offices from 64 to 75 in the current fiscal. 

 SBI is present in 36 countries and foreign operations contribute 4.72 per cent of the banks total profits.

 We are looking at a couple of acquisitions in Africa and Asia, Purwar said.

 SBI is keen to take over small and medium-size banks with good balance sheets and grow organically. Due diligence has started and will be completed in the next couple of months. The acquisition will be over in the current fiscal, he added. SBI has recently acquired a bank in Mauritius.

 State Bank is keen on entering the pension fund business once the regulations are in place. It is open to the idea of roping in a foreign partner for the pension fund venture.

 The bank will also soon get a partner for its IT venture ? SBI Infotech. We are close to a deal, the SBI chairman said.

 State Bank is also open to the idea of holding a minority stake in the IT business, Purwar said, adding that infotech is not the core business of the bank.

 SBI will redeem its India Millennium Bond worth $6 billion in the current fiscal. We will try to retain the funds by asking our overseas branch to approach the bondholders for investing in our products, Purwar said.

 The search for a strategic partner for SBI Caps is still on even though it has become vibrant with a recovery in the capital markets, he added.

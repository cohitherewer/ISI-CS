 Future is perfect, freedom not far

 ING vysya life Insurance has recently unveiled two unit-linked life insurance plans?Freedom and Future Perfect.

 The Freedom plan allows the customer to plan investments, contributions, withdrawals and life protection over a flexible policy period as short as five years and as long as 25 years. The minimum life cover is Rs 75,000 with the maximum sum assured being equal to one-and-a-half times the total regular premium payable under the policy. The minimum premium amount is Rs 15,000 annually with a top-up facility subject to a minimum of Rs 5,000 as and when you wish. There are partial withdrawal options starting from the sixth year and a full surrender option from the second year onward.

 The Future Perfect plan provides regular income during retirement years (from age 60 to 80) based on the accumulated fund that is built up through flexible contributions during the earning years along with life protection. 

 The minimum and maximum entry age is 8 years and 55 years respectively. The premium paying period, including the premium and the sum assured amount, is similar to that of the Freedom plan. However, for this plan, full-life cover continues till the age of 60. After 60, it gets reduced to 50 per cent of the original sum assured.

 Customers can choose among four investment options ? debt, secure, balanced and growth ? with increasing equity exposure. Policyholders can switch between funds at any time, with two free changes every year. The fund management charges vary between 0.75 per cent to 1.25 per cent apart from the initial and recurring policy charges.

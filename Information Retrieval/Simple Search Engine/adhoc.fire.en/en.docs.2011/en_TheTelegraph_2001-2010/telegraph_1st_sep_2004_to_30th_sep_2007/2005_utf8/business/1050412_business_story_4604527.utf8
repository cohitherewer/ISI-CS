 Results, oil keep markets on edge

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 11: A wait-and-watch stance before the big results start pouring in and simmering concerns over crude prices sent the markets into another tailspin today with the sensex tumbling 82.02 points to 6397.52.

 Flagging interest on Dalal Street was evident in its volumes, which dropped to Rs 1527.87 crore from Rs 1906.95 crore on Friday. The sensex opened at 6477.14 and plumbed 6382.13 before ending with a decline of 1.27 per cent; it has fallen 208.89 points, or 3.16 per cent, in three sessions.

 Brokers and investors were worried about how the flare-up in oil will affect bottomlines of manufacturing firms. 

 Today, Mastek kicked off a busy earnings season, which features Hero Honda Motors on Tuesday, HDFC Bank on Wednesday and Infosys Technologies on Thursday.

 ?The results of Infosys will be widely watched for. Though the company is known to give out a conservative guidance, there is some degree of worry over the impact of fringe benefit tax on infotech companies,? an analyst with a local brokerage pointed out.

 The future course for the markets will also depend on FII inflows. 

 Infosys, Wipro and TCS suffered reverses. Wipro lost Rs 15.20 at Rs 652.30, Satyam Rs 10.75 at Rs 400.80 and Infosys Rs 47.40 at Rs 2079.20. 

 Meanwhile, the BSE introduced two indices, BSE mid-cap index and BSE small-cap index, to track performance of mid and small capital companies. These indices would be calculated and disseminated on a real-time basis on the bourse?s BOLT system.

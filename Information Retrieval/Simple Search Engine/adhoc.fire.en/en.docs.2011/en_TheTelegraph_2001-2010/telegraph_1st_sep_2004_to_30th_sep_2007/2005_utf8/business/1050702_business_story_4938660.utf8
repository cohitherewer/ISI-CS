 Mack returns to Morgan 

 LANDON THOMAS JR.

 New York, July 1: For John J. Mack, the new chief executive of Morgan Stanley, it was a moment to savour. On his triumphant return Thursday to the investment bank that unceremoniously dropped him four years ago, Mack was greeted by a standing ovation from a crowd of 200 employees gathered in a conference room at Morgan Stanleys towering Manhattan headquarters in Times Square.

 But for all the cheering, Mack immediately faced the task of bandaging the wounds that deeply scarred the fractured firm under Philip J. Purcell, the former chief executive of Morgan Stanley who forced out Mack in a power struggle in 2001. The tensions facing Mack were evident in the announcement after the market closed that Zoe Cruz and Stephen S. Crawford, co-presidents of the investment bank under Purcell, had resigned from the board.

 , signalling the first of what are likely to be a series of high-level moves at Morgan Stanley.

 Crawford and Cruz, who were appointed during a management shake-up in March, were closely linked to Purcell, and their board seats had become an emotional point of contention inside the firm. Mack, in an interview, said he had not asked them to step down; they will remain in their executive posts, at least for now.

 In his brief speech to Morgan Stanleys employees, Mack said he felt as if he was home again and proclaimed his belief in the one-firm firm, a mantra he has echoed from his days as president at Morgan Stanley to his time as chief executive at Credit Suisse First Boston.

 And while Macks voice cracked a bit in the end as he took in the crowd ? the majority of them executives who had worked with him during his 29 years at the company ? he showed his well-known steely side too.

 We are going to bring some people back, he said. But on our terms, not theirs.

 Miles L. Marsh, the lead director of Morgan Stanleys board, also described Cruzs and Crawfords resignations from the board as voluntary. But the moves also demonstrated just how much manoeuvring room Mack will have as he begins to reshape a board that had largely been put together by Purcell.

 I would not come back if I didnt trust this board and have the assurance that they wanted me back, Mack said in an interview after the board formally elected him chairman and chief executive. Even in the light of what happened four years ago.

 It is widely expected that several directors with ties to Purcell will not stand for election at next years annual meeting.

 We are here to announce the worst kept secret on Wall Street, Marsh told the Morgan Stanley gathering as Mack, Crawford and Cruz all looked on. After some comments thanking Purcell for his contributions, Marsh told executives that from the moment Purcell had resigned as chief executive, Mack had been on their minds. He then introduced Mack as the man from Rye.

 Deciding on a fresh management structure for the firm that can bring together its fractious bankers and traders will fully test Macks management skills. In recent weeks, the mudslinging between bankers favouring Cruz and others in the camp of Vikram S. Pandit, the former president of the firms institutional securities division, has made Morgan Stanleys executive suite seem more like an overcrowded sand box in a schoolyard. And it is clearly paining Mack.

 These are talented individuals and we want people to come back, he said. But they will have to put aside their conflicts.

 By adopting what some saw as a severe tone in referring to the former executives ? asking them to come back on the firms terms, not theirs ? Mack runs the risk of alienating the departed executives. Many of them have been courted by rival firms; Joseph R. Perella, the mergers and acquisitions banker who recently left the firm, proved his worth by personally advising MBNA on its deal with Bank of America.

 The group of dissident executives who fought to oust Purcell has always been ambivalent about Mack. Indeed, if they do not return, they could well resume their public campaign seeking further changes at Morgan Stanley.

 In a statement the dissident executives said: We hope that John will be able to attract back many of the talented employees who left the firm during this stressful period, in particular the five former members of the management committee who are so important to the firms franchise.

 One of those is Pandit, a cerebral derivative expert with an academic bent. He is poles apart in personality and management style from Cruz, a fiery foreign exchange trader ? yet they both claim Mack as a corporate sponsor.

 Pandit and Cruz clashed on numerous matters in the past, including how much of the firms capital should be used for trading purposes. When Pandit left Morgan Stanley, declaring his loyalty to the firm and not Purcell, and Cruz declared her loyalty to Purcell, what had been a run-of-the-mill executive suite spat became more like a blood feud.

 Now Mack must decide whether his famed ability to grab petulant investment bankers by the ear and get them to work together can result in Pandit returning and Cruz staying on.

 Over the weekend, Mack called Pandit and asked him to return, although he did not discuss any specifics of what his position would be. Purcell eliminated Pandits position when he appointed Crawford and Cruz co-presidents. Mack also put a call into Perella, urging him to come home, too.

 Pandit and Cruz declined to comment.

 Mack said he intended to spend the next weeks talking with people inside the firm about who should stay and who should go. While he said Thursday that he would not make a decision about management structure in the near term, he will be under pressure to act quickly, given the current levels of uncertainty about who the firms president should be.

 And while a number of bankers have lobbied Mack that he should reconsider her position, Mack is also aware that Cruz has her own base of support within the fixed-income division, an area that produces a large share of the firms profits.

 Mack said that he put in a telephone call in recent days to Purcell, who cleared out his office last week, and that they had a cordial conversation. Mack is expected to move into the office next week.

 But already, barraged as he may be by competing factions asking him to take immediate action on several fronts, Mack took a page from Purcell - who had urged his bankers to ignore the newspapers and return to work during his retirement speech in mid June.

 quot;The first thing, quot; Mack said, quot;is to get everyone to stop looking at the headlines. quot;

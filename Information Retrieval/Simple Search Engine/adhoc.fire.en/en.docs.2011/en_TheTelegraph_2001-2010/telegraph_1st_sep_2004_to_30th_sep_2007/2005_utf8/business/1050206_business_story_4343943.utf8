 Balrampur preferential issue priced at Rs 585

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb 5: The board of Balrampur Chini Mills Limited has decided to allot 19.33 lakh equity shares on a preferential basis at Rs 585 apiece to two long-term private equity investors. The preferential offer will fetch the company Rs 113.08 crore. Citicorp, through their investment vehicle Citicorp International Finance Corporation (CIFC), will buy 17.09 lakh shares, while New Vernon Bharat Ltd will pick up 2.24 lakh shares.

 The proceeds from the issue will be used to part-finance the Rs 400-crore expansion programme of the company over the next two years. The company?s internal accruals and external borrowings will take care of the remaining investment. IFC Washington is a long-term lender to the company with an exposure of around $15 million.

 The management has also decided to split the company?s stocks of Rs 10 each into Re 1.

 The company has already commenced work on a 7000-TCD sugar plant at Akbarpur in Uttar Pradesh. It is also expanding capacity of its existing mills at Tulsipur, Babhnan and Haidergarh by 4,000 TCD. It will also set up another greenfield project in eastern Uttar Pradesh with a capacity of 7000 tonnes crushed per day (TCD). 

 The second factory will have a 20 MW power plant and an industrial alcohol distillery facility and is expected to be operational in November 2006 while the first factory will be operational by November this year. The total cost of the expansion will be Rs 400 crore.

 With the completion of the expansion programme, the total capacity of Balrampur Chini is slated to increase from 29,000 TCD to 47,000 TCD, while the distillery capacity will increase from 160 KLPD to 240 KLPD and co-generation from 47.8 MW to 67.8 MW.

 This would make it the largest sugar producer in India, surpassing the four sugar companies of the KK Birla group, which together add up to around 36,000 TCD.

 The current capacity of the Tulsipur unit is 6,000 TCD while that of the Bhabnan unit is 8,000 TCD. The capacity of the Balrampur unit is 10,000 TCD and that of the Haidergarh unit, which is an integrated sugar complex, is 5,000 TCD.

 The share price of Balrampur Chini Mills touched the 52-week high on Friday at Rs 703.95 on the Bombay Stock Exchange and closed at Rs 696.90, up 4.91 per cent per cent from the previous close of Rs 664.30. 

 The company last tapped the equity market in August-September 2004, with its Rs 60-crore rights issue.

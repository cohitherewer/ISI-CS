 Former VW adviser in custody

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Aug. 12: Ashok Jain, former legal adviser to the Volkswagen India project and a key associate of Helmuth Schuster, was today remanded in judicial custody till August 25 in connection with the Rs 11.7-crore scam in Andhra Pradesh. 

 Jain, who was arrested in Agra yesterday by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), was flown to Hyderabad this afternoon from New Delhi. 

 He has been taken in custody because of the alleged misappropriation of crores of rupees of the Andhra Pradesh government meant for the Volkswagen deal.

 Justice Sheshagiri Rao of the 12th metropolitan magistrate court remanded Jain in custody for investigation. His premises had been raided by the agency during which it seized all bank accounts and claimed to have got important documents related to the scam.

 The investigating body had also raided the residences of two other associates of Schuster ? Jagadish Alagar Raja and Buwanesh Chaturvedi ? for their involvement with the fly-by-night company, Vashisht Wahan. 

 The CBI last week registered a case against officials of the private firm to which the Andhra Pradesh government released Rs 11.7 crore (equivalent to 2 million euros) for a car manufacturing plant joint venture.

 Patni ready for flotation abroad

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 18: Patni Computer Systems Ltd has filed a registration statement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its initial public offering of 68.75 lakh American depository shares (ADS). 

 The price of the offering will be determined by the prevailing market rates of its equity shares in India, Patni said. This will be after taking into account certain market conditions, the company added. 

 The Patni share opened at Rs 473.80 today on the Bombay Stock Exchange and soared to Rs 486.90 before closing at Rs 472.20. The Patni scrip was listed on the local bourses only last year. 

 Patni, whose shares are traded on the BSE, said it intends to list the ADSs, each of which represents two equity shares, on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PTI. 

 The company will offer 51.25 lakh ADSs and a shareholder will sell another 1.75 million ADSs for a total offering of 68.75 lakh depository shares. 

 Leading investment bankers Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC, Merrill Lynch amp; Co and ABN Amro Rothschild LLC will underwrite the offering and will have the option to buy another 1 million depository shares to cover over-allotments. Jefferies Macquarie Bank Limited will assist in the operations.

 Patnis prospectus shows that General Atlantic Partners Mauritius plans to sell 3.5 million equity shares, or the equivalent of 1.75 million depository shares. The sale would leave the investor with a 16.82 per cent stake from almost 21 per cent, helping the venture capital firm make a profit from its investment. 

 After listing, Patni will join a list of illustrious companies from the infotech segment, which have their shares listed on the American bourses. 

 Infosys Technologies, Wipro Ltd and Satyam Computers are already listed on the US bourses. Waiting on the sidelines is Tata Consultancy Services. 

 Patni said in the red herring prospectus that it plans to use the proceeds to construct and develop new infrastructure facilities at its offshore locations. It will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by General Atlantic. 

 Patni is one of the oldest infotech companies in India. 

 Narayana Murthy, the current chairman and chief mentor of Infosys Technologies, was at one point an employee of Patni. 

 During the third quarter ended September 30, Patni posted a 9 per cent increase in revenues at Rs 519.7 crore against that recorded in the year-ago period. Its net income was Rs 71.35 crore, an increase of 14 per cent from the corresponding period last year. 

 Revenues from General Electric ? one of the top clients of the company ? were up 11.5 per cent on a sequential basis. 

 During the quarter, Patni posted a strong growth in financial services, telecommunications and product engineering services.

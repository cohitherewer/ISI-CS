 Countdown starts for CST

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: The government plans to phase out the central sales tax (CST) within two to three years as Parliament approved a legislation amending the Central Sales Tax Act, 1956.

 The CST amendment bill provides for a central appellate authority, which will serve as the final court of appeal against sales tax cases till the CST is phased out. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram told the Rajya Sabha that the CST would be eventually phased out and talks are underway with state governments for compensating them on the consequent loss in revenue. The CST had been a stumbling block for BJP-ruled states who were not willing to join the VAT regime. It was seen as a case of double taxation and was objected to by these states. 

 Recently, Chidambaram had decided on a timeframe for phasing out the CST and a compensation formula.

 Tax hurdles slow mobile march

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 2: If you are complaining about a high tariff on mobile phones here, compare with other developing countries. In many countries a mobile phone is still unaffordable due to high taxes, says a global organisation for mobile communications.

 According to the Global System for Mobile Communication Association (GSMA), in 16 of some 50 developing countries, taxes constitute more than 20 per cent of the total cost of owning and using a mobile phone. And in 14 of these countries, an average mobile phone user pays more than $40 a year in taxes on handsets and mobile services. (See chart)

 Rob Conway, chief executive officer of GSMA, said, ?There is a great irony in the way governments tackle the digital divide. They (the governments) say they want more of their people to have access to communications and yet they impose high taxes on cellular phones and their usage.?

 The study was conducted on behalf of the GSMA by Frontier Economics, Pyramid Research and Tarifica in association with Deloitte amp; Touche LLP and it is the first research to examine the impact of taxes on the affordability of mobile phones in a large number of developing countries.

 The Indian government has brought down the import duties on handsets over the past three years, helping mobile phone coverage grow to more than 5 per cent of the population from less than 1 per cent. But the service tax and other state levies still make the cost of handsets and services costly. A senior executive of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) said, ?We hope our finance minister takes a sympathetic view towards Indian mobile users. If he wants the GDP to grow, telecom can be a major growth driver.?

 ?We agree that ours is one of the lowest (taxes on mobile phones/service) compared with others, but it needs to be brought down further,? said the COAI official.

 Nineteen of the countries surveyed in the study levy additional taxes, on top of standard sales taxes, on mobile phone users.

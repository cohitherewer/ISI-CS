 Maytag falls for Whirlpool

 Big plans

 Atlanta, Aug. 13 (Reuters): Appliance maker Maytag Corporation on Friday said a $1.68-billion takeover offer from rival Whirlpool Corporation was a ?superior? proposal, and withdrew its support for a lower bid by a private equity firm. 

 A merger between the two US firms would create the world?s largest appliance maker. Maytag said an investor group led by Ripplewood Holdings, which offered $14 a share, or $1.1 billion in May, may be entitled to a $40-million merger break-up fee, which Whirlpool has agreed to pay. 

 ?I think Whirlpool has set itself up with a high-enough bid to win the company,? said Morgan Keegan analyst Laura Champine. ?My guess is that within a week, we?ll have a definitive merger agreement between Whirlpool and Maytag, and Ripplewood is out of it.? 

 Maytag said Whirlpool?s higher cash and stock offer was better for shareholders and is reasonably capable of being completed. 

 ?It would be inconsistent with the Maytag board?s exercise of its fiduciary duty? to not withdraw support for the Ripplewood all-cash deal, Maytag said in a statement. 

 The move was a victory for Whirlpool, which raised its offer this week a third time to $21 a share, or $1.68 billion. It initially bid $17 a share, or $1.3 billion in mid-July. 

 The acquisition would help Jeff Fettig, who became Whirlpool?s chairman and chief executive just over a year ago, create an appliance powerhouse with well-known brands and sales of $17.9 billion, based on 2004 results. Maytag makes Hoover vacuums and Jenn-Air and Amana appliances, while Whirlpool?s brands include KitchenAid, Roper and Inglis. 

 But a proposed union of the two rivals is expected to draw close antitrust scrutiny. In the United States, Whirlpool is the number one appliance company, while Maytag is the third biggest. 

 Ripplewood, which showed interest in buying Maytag in March 2004, has five business days to raise its bid or walk away and collect the $40 million termination fee. 

 In an effort to sway Maytag?s board, Whirlpool offered to pay that charge as well as a $120 million ?reverse break-up fee? if the US regulators block its proposed deal.

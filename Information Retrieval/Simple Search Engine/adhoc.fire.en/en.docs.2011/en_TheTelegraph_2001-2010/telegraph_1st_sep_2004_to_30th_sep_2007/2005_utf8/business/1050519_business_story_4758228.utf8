 Markets breathe easy, other suspects queasy

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 18: Markets heaved a sigh of relief today after indications emerged that participatory notes would not be scrapped as a vehicle for foreign investment.

 The signals came from Delhi, where Sebi chief M. Damodaran said the notes would not be banned for foreign investors, who often use these to buy stocks even if they are not registered with the market regulator here.

 On Dalal Street, the sensex bounced back from an intra-day low of 6380.53 in a dreary session to end with a loss of only 19 points at 6447 against its previous close of 6466. At the lowest point, the index had given up over 85 points.

 The recovery began late in the afternoon, after Damodaran told a CII conclave in Delhi that there was no plan to proscribe participatory notes even though it had chastised a UBS arm on Tuesday for not revealing the names of clients who invested through that route in May 2004.

 It is learnt two Delhi brokers have been served a show-cause notice and so have four other institutional investors. However, this could not be officially confirmed. 

 Sebi also clarified on its website that it would be presumptuous to observe the order on UBS Securities was the first in a long line of convictions yet to come. 

 The investigation/proceedings in 11 other cases, in which show-cause notices have been sent, are in various stages and may take a while to be completed, it added.

 Sebi slapped notices on 12 entities, but has so far pinned down only UBS Securities for not complying with its rules on furnishing details of participatory notes. The company cited client confidentiality norms as a reason for not giving away the names of its top five clients.

 Corporate lawyers said the order on UBS is a signal to the other 11 entities being probed to help in the efforts aimed at unmasking those responsible for the May 17 mayhem.

 Other foreign funds being investigated are Caxton International, Moore Global Fixed Income Fund, Indus Asia Pacific Fund, Discovery Global Opportunities, Moore Macro Fund, Rahatyn TRG Global Opportunity Master Fund, Sac Capital Associates, DKR Soundshore, Indea Capital, Sattva Asia Opportunities Master Fund, Lehman Brothers Finance and PMA Capital Management.

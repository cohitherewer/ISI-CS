 Swords out in battle against prices

 New Delhi/Mumbai, Oct 24: The government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intend to take a series of measures to put a lid on inflation, which has risen to 4.6 per cent on the back of a blow-out in world crude oil prices this year.

 The RBI and the Centre have set an inflation forecast of 5 to 5.5 per cent for the year to March 2006 ? and the surge in world crude prices threatens to knock that estimate into a cocked hat, unless some drastic measures are taken.

 We will continue to watch the price line. We will take monetary and fiscal steps (to rein in inflation). Lets see what the RBI does tomorrow, finance minister P. Chidambaram told reporters in Delhi on the sidelines of an awards ceremony organised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

 In Mumbai, the Reserve Bank unveiled its mid-term review of macroeconomic and monetary developments, in which it expressed deep concern over the rise in oil prices and the fact that it had not been factored in fully into the inflation numbers till date.

 The RBI said oil prices had surged 83 per cent in 18 months, from $33.7 per barrel in March 2004 to $61.7, in September 2005. 

 There has been no indication of a let-up in crude prices. This prompted the RBI to question the advisability of treating the increase as a shock, rather than a permanent shift in relative prices, in its note which serves as a backdrop for the mid-term review of the annual policy statement it will unveil tomorrow.

 The inevitability of second-order effects on inflation needs to be taken on board. The pass-through of high international crude oil prices to domestic prices remains incomplete, the note warned.

 Chidambaram didnt appear to agree with this view. As I have said earlier, there is bound to be some impact of the fuel price hike on inflation. So, price rise is inevitable. I think the fuel pass-through impact is over.

 The RBI said the impact of crude prices had not been felt in a number of countries where the governments were not passing on the full burden to consumers. 

 With oil prices rising, the policy of low pass-through to domestic prices poses risks to fiscal health and macroeconomic stability. Furthermore, it also discourages efficiency in use of oil. Many countries have, therefore, begun to pass on higher oil prices to consumers, the RBI said. It said the pass-through in the US and some countries of Europe was 80 to 90 per cent.

 The year-on-year WPI inflation, excluding fuels, was lower at 2.1 per cent on October 1. For the past year, it has remained around 1.5 to 2 percentage points below the headline inflation, the RBI note said.

 Subir Gokarn, chief economist at Crisil, said the central bank was anticipating a surge in the core inflation rate (excluding food and energy prices) with indications firm crude oil prices were here to stay. He said this was a sign RBI would raise interest rates on Tuesday.

 Bankers expect a rise in the reverse repo rate ? the rate at which banks park their surplus cash with the central bank ? by 25 basis points to 5.25 per cent. The bank had last raised the rate in April. Officials in the finance ministry put GDP growth at 7 per cent. This is based on an inflation of 5 to 5.5 per cent and stable interest rates.

 Chidambaram stressed the need to push for growth with equity to reduce poverty. With growth there is a chance of equity. Without growth, there is no chance.

 The finance minister said the government would announce another auction of bonds shortly. The last auction of bonds worth Rs 4,000 crore was cancelled by RBI. We cancelled that auction because we thought it was not the correct price, the minister said.

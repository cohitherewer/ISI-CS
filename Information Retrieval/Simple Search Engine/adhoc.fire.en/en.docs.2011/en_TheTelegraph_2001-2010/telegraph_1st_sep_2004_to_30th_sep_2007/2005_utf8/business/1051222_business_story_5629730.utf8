 Nath fortifies WTO defence

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: Commerce minister Kamal Nath assured the Lok Sabha today that the WTOs Hong Kong ministerial declaration fully protects the interests of our farmers.

 The minister said the provision of the special products and the special safeguard mechanism in the ministerial declaration is, in fact, a major gain for India.

 He explained that developing countries would be able to self-designate an appropriate number of tariff lines as special products guided by indicators based on the criteria of food security, livelihood security and rural development for which tariffs would not be reduced. 

 To safeguard farmers against a sudden surge in imports or fall in international prices, developing countries will have recourse to a special safeguard mechanism with regards to both import quantities and price triggers, he added.

 The declaration has addressed Indias core concerns and has positive development content which would need to be built upon and fully realised in the next stage of negotiations, Nath exuded.

 He said India and other developing countries had fought a long, hard battle for a positive outcome in the trade negotiations. 

 The coming months, Nath added, would see intense negotiations as the modalities of the declaration would be finalised.

 He mentioned the green box criteria would be reviewed so that the developing countries programmes, which have minimal trade distorting effect, would be incorporated in it. Developing countries like India will be able to continue to provide marketing and transport subsidies for five years after the elimination of export subsidies in 2018, the minister clarified.

 He said the developed countries would have to fully eliminate export subsidies extended to the cotton farmers by 2006 and the trade-distorting domestic support over a shorter period than for other agricultural products.

 However, questioning the claims made by the minister, BJP leader V.K. Malhotra said the outcome was not in the interest of India. He wanted a full debate on the issue.

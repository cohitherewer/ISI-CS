 World Bank focus on FI governance 

 New Delhi, Dec. 17 (PTI): The World Bank today said the Indian government should urgently focus on the corporate governance of institutional investors who are playing an active role in the countrys market and gaining in influence.

 We believe that this area should engage the attention of policy makers as the corporate governance monitoring mechanisms of institutional investors would be only as good as the corporate governance standards that they set for themselves, World Banks India director Michael Carter said.

 Speaking at a seminaron the Role of Institutional Investors in the Governance of Their Portfolio Companies, Carter said they had a special function to perform, particularly in view of their growing portfolios.

 They should be encouraged to be more of an activist, seeking information and using voting rights for ensuring adherence to corporate governance, he said.

 Highlighting some of the important areas for reforms, he suggested enhanced disclosure by institutional investors on their corporate governance and voting policies and voting records.

 Also, they should not hesitate in disclosure of conflicts of interests which may affect the exercise of key ownership rights in their portfolio companies, he said.

 Carter said disclosing this information was critical for institutional investors acting in a fiduciary capacity like mutual funds and insurance companies who had responsibility to protect their participants.

 Company affairs minister P.C. Gupta urged the financial institutions to play a major role in making corporate houses adhere to corporate governance norms.

 These days institutional investors hold substantial stakes in any company and have the right to nominate directors on the board of such companies. They are certainly in a position to see that the companies are not deviating from the norms of good corporate governance, he said.

 Rajnikant Patel, CEO and managing director of Bombay Stock Exchange, said institutional holding in Indias leading companies has been growing by days.

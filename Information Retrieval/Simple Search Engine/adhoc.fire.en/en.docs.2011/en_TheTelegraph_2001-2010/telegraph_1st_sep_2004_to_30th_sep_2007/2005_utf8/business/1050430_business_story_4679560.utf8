 Visa plans to hike Orissa capacity 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 29: Visa International plans to scale up the capacity of its proposed integrated steel plant in Orissa to 5 million tonnes.

 The Calcutta-based company has already written to the Orissa government as well as chief minister Navin Pattanaik about its intent.

 ?We have taken an in-principle decision to scale up the capacity to 5 million tonnes. The modalities are being worked out now,? chairman Vishambhar Saran said.

 Two rounds of talks have been held with consultant MN Dastur to ascertain the land requirement for the proposed plant.

 After the techno-economic feasibility report (TFR) is prepared, the company will put forward a concrete proposal before the Orissa government for land requirement.

 Saran said a 5-million-tonne capacity would be of a global scale. ?If we do not get contiguous land in the existing location, we can consider Dhuburi,? he added.

 If the project is split, Dhuburi may be home to a 3-million-tonne hot-rolled coil (HRC) plant, while the existing location in the Kalinganagar Industrial Complex will have 2 MT of alloyed steel and stainless steel.

 The investment in the first phase is Rs 1,600 crore. ?We have not worked out what could be the additional investment. Even as it varies between Rs 2,000 crore and 2,500 crore per tonne, we can do it at a much lower cost,? Saran said. However, additional facilities like coke oven plant and waste heat recovery power plant will come at an extra cost.

 The company recently achieved a financial closure of 0.4 MT per annum stamp-charged coke oven project. But Saran said it would be first scaled up to 0.8 MT and then to 1.2 MT. Work on the first phase coke oven project has already been initiated with promoters? equity and is expected to be completed by December 2005. The total investment will be Rs 160 crore.

 Market springs surprise bounce

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 10: Markets today recorded their sharpest rise since the budget was presented in February, though players were left scratching their heads on what caused the spurt.

 Cutting short the three-session losing streak, the BSE sensex rose 134 points. It was the biggest gain in five months, dealers said. Some attributed it to rosy corporate scorecards. 

 Much of the surge came at the fag end of trading, when the index jumped 70-80 points.

 ?It?s baffling,? said Arun Kejriwal of KRIS, a portfolio advisory firm. ?I have no clue and I wish I knew,? he added.

 The markets opened under the shadow of the Nanavati Commission report on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, which has left the government struggling to cope with demands for the ouster of some ruling party top guns.

 The US Fed?s decision to raise interest rates by 25 basis points also appeared to have come as a drag, at least in the first flush. The FIIs seemed to have bought only Rs 108 crore worth of shares on Tuesday, a modest sum according to recent trends. However, investors from Japan were big buyers in today?s session, dealers said. 

 The 30-share sensex opened firm at 7615.90 and gradually moved to an intra-day high of 7741.35, before closing the day at 7729.82 compared with Tuesday?s finish of 7595.57, a rise of 134.25 points or 1.77 per cent.

 Among the major gainers were bank shares. This was mirrored in the BSE bankex, which rappelled up 97.80 points to 4598.75 from Tuesday?s close of 4500.95.

 Index heavyweights like Reliance Industries, Infosys, SBI, Satyam Computers, Tata Steel, ITC, Grasim, Bhel, ICICI Bank and Bharti Tele also made big leaps.

 The broad-based BSE-100 recovered 74.98 points to 4148.48 from Tuesday?s close of 4073.50.

 The volume of business was relatively low at Rs 3249.16 crore compared with Rs 3595.23 crore on Tuesday. Reliance Capital was the top-traded scrip with a turnover of Rs 240.15 crore, followed by RIL with Rs 163.78 crore.

 RIL gained Rs 11.95 to Rs 719.25, State Bank rose by Rs 31.55 to Rs 808 and Tata Steel by Rs 10.05 to Rs 398.20. ITC added Rs 34.70 to Rs 1736.70, while Infosys gained Rs 51.65 to Rs 2315.15, ICICI Bank by Rs 10.50 to Rs 493.10, Hindalco by Rs 25.50 to Rs 1365.70, HDFC Bank by Rs 5.30 to Rs 659.70.

 Among the few losers were Bajaj Auto, which dropped by Rs 23.75 to Rs 1411.70.

 Volcker-stained firms told to share records

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said some Indian companies whose names figure in the Volcker report have been asked to share records with the government. On the other hand, Reliance Industries today refuted reports about complaints being filed against it with investigating authorities. 

 We have asked a few companies to share some records and information with us. Beyond that, I dont want to say anything, Chidambaram said at the economic editors conference here.

 He said it was premature to disclose details about the investigation initiated by the government in the wake of the Volcker report.

 The finance minister rubbished reports that the government had planned to sue the United Nations for the claims made in the Volcker report against the Congress party and Natwar Singh.

 On November 3, two statements were issued ? one by the Prime Ministers office and another by the Congress party. Please read them carefully. Nowhere, has the word sue been used, he said. 

 The Congress partys statement said it would issue a comprehensive legal notice seeking all details about the alleged deals, he clarified.

 Meanwhile, Reliance Industries today refuted reports that a complaint has been filed against the company with the Enforcement Directorate related to purchase of Iraqi crude.

 The company said between April 2000 and May 2002, Reliance bought 30.6 million barrels of Basrah light crude from various trading companies on a negotiated, market-competitive price based on declared official selling prices approved by the UN.

 Reliance said all these trading companies got their allocation either directly from the State Oil Marketing Organisation of the Iraqi government under the UN oil-for-food programme or bought the crude from a party having such direct allocation under proper UN authorisation.

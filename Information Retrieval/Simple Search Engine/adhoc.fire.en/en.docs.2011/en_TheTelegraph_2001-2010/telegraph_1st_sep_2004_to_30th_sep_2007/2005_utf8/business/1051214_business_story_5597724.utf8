 Vodafone wins Turkey bid

 Istanbul, Dec. 13 (Reuters): Vodafone won an auction on Tuesday to buy Turkeys second biggest mobile phone operator, Telsim, in a fresh boost for the European Union candidate countrys drive to attract more foreign investment.

 Vodafone made the highest bid of $4.55 billion (?2.6 billion) in an open auction tender, beating Kuwaits MTC into second place. Turkeys Savings Deposits Insurance Fund )had set a minimum sale price threshold of $2.8 billion. Vodafone said it would have to spend around $1 billion in additional short-term funding for Telsim, which was expected to make a net loss in the short to medium term.

 The buy would dilute Vodafones adjusted earnings per share in that period, although it was not expected to have any impact on the groups share buyback programme or its credit rating.

 Of the six participants, Russias Sistema and the United Arab Emiratess telecom group Etisalat were eliminated before the open bidding began because they had submitted the lowest offers in sealed envelopes.

 The other firms competing for Telsim were Egypts Orascom and Emaar of Dubai.

 Economists reaction to the result was subdued.

 The winning price is at the low end of expectations, which had been for $5-7 billion, said Tim Ash of London-based Bear Stearns International in an investment note.

 Given commitments to creditors, the Turkish treasury will probably walk away with just $2-3 billion from the deal. Net-net, slightly disappointing, but at least it marks another privatisation deal done, he said.

 Turkeys once-shaky privatisation programme, a key plank of its $10-billion standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund, has gathered steam in the past year, drawing in more foreign investors as the economy booms.

 The start of long-delayed European Union entry talks in October has also helped Turkey project the image of a more stable economy attractive for large, long-term investments.

 US giant bids for Canadian wine rival

 High spirits

 New York, Sept. 28 (Reuters): Constellation Brands Inc, the worlds largest wine company, has launched an unsolicited bid to buy Canadian rival Vincor International Inc for about C$1.1 billion ($900 million).

 Fairport, New York-based Constellation offered to pay C$31.00 ($26.45) per share in cash, a 32 per cent premium over Vincors Tuesday closing price of C$23.47 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The transaction also includes about C$305 million ($260 million) of assumed debt, Constellation said.

 Calls to Mississauga, Ontario-based Vincor and an outside spokesman for the company were not immediately returned.

 Constellation wine brands include Alice White, Robert Mondavi, Ravenswood and Ruffino, and its portfolio includes Corona, the largest US beer import. Vincor wine brands include Hogue, R.H. Phillips, Toasted Head and New Zealands Kim Crawford.

 Constellation, which paid $1.04 billion for Mondavi last year, has repeatedly said it expects acquisitions to be a major contributor to future growth. It said it will offer a higher price for Vincor if circumstances warrant.

 In a letter dated Tuesday to Vincor chief executive Donald Triggs and Chairman Mark Hilson, Constellation chief executive Richard Sands said, We are ... disappointed by your rejection in our meeting today of our proposal to acquire Vincor and your boards refusal to engage in discussions on this matter.

 Sands said he also spoke with Triggs on September 9 and September 23, and with Hilson on the latter date. He said Constellation is prepared to complete negotiations by October 14. Constellation was not immediately available for further comment.

 Constellation reported a $73.2-million first-quarter profit, or 32 cents per share, on $1.1 billion of sales. Vincor posted a profit of C$8.3 million, or 25 cents, on C$165.8 million of net sales.

 Sands said Constellations proposal would provide Vincors shareholders with an immediate cash premium far greater than we believe the company can deliver on its own, given todays increasingly competitive and consolidating global wine industry.

 Constellation said its proposal is not conditional on financing, but that it has received commitments for sufficient all-debt financing to complete it.

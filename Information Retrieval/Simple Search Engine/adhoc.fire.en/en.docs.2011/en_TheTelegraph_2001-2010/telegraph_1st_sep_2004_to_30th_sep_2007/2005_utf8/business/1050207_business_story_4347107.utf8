 Calcutta, Feb. 6: Service providers are expecting a boom in the mobile games segment as more and more users are looking for handsets with additional entertainment features.

 According to In-Stat/MDR, a US-based research agency, the wireless gaming market in India will grow to $26 million by 2005 and $336 million by 2009.

 India constitutes only 5 per cent of the global wireless gaming industry. However, it is poised for growth with GSM and CDMA operators clocking an average of 220,000 downloads per month.

 Bharti Tele-Ventures group CMO amp; director (mobility) Atul Bindal said, ?We offer a variety of content through the AirTel Live multi-access entertainment portal. Among the more downloaded content of 2004 are games like Spiderman and Van Helsing.? AirTel crossed the 5-million-GPRS-download mark in July 2004, five months since its launch.

 Reliance Infocomm, which offers a wide range of downloadable content on R-World, registers one million hits everyday for the 48 games on offer. Reliance had also set the ball rolling with its gaming contest in association with Microsoft.

 India is expected to replicate the success of mobile gaming leaders Japan and Korea. The US is also a favoured destination for PC and console gaming. Additionally, with Samsung, Nokia and Sony Ericsson logging in to the gaming mode with game-specific handsets like the N-Gage, the industry is expected to gain momentum.

 Jamdat, a US-based mobile gaming company, has recently started operations in Hyderabad. Jamdat Mobile (India) managing director Surya Pulagam said, ?The market is still premature. However, with most carriers promoting gaming and a fast-growing cellular subscriber base, India could become a significant market for the global wireless gaming industry in the next five years.? Jamdat is already in the final stages of tying up with major carriers in India and plans to launch some of its games in the first quarter of 2005. ?Around 90 games are currently on offer globally,? added Pulagam. ?However, we want to enter the Indian market cautiously and slowly penetrate the game-user segment.? 

 The global mobile gaming market is estimated at over $1 billion and is growing between 20 to 30 per cent annually. ?PC gaming did not catch up in India mainly due to the large grey market,? said analysts. ?However, the scenario in mobile gaming is different as the content comprises mainly Java-enabled games that can be downloaded over the service provider?s network.? 

 This market has boosted the growth of an entire cycle of game publishers, developers, animators, musicians and content providers. Paradox, Tinfomobile, Gametrix, Dhruva Interactive, India Games and Mobile2Win create content for home and abroad.

 Companies bill put on fast track

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 8: The government today said the draft companies bill would incorporate the JJ Irani committee recommendations for listed companies. The panel had recommended that listed companies should have at least one-third independent directors on their boards and the requirement could begin with companies whose shares were being traded on the stock exchanges and those accepting public money.

 The department of company affairs (DCA) will now bring the bill before the Union cabinet and try to ensure that it is passed in the forthcoming winter session of Parliament.

 ?Necessary consultations have been made with all stakeholders and the views of the finance and legal affairs ministries have also been solicited. All these opinions will be referred to the expert committee on revamping of the Companies Act,? said Jitesh Khosla, joint secretary, ministry of company affairs, while addressing a national conference on global mergers and acquisitions organised by Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India.

 In contrast to the Irani committee recommendations, the Securities and Exchange Board of India?s (Sebi) clause 49 says that companies having an executive chairman should have 50 per cent independent directors on their boards. The clause 49 is slated to come into force from this year-end. 

 Khosla said, ?If companies want to have 50 per cent independent directors on their boards, they are welcome. In any case, the norm of minimum one-third independent directors should be adhered to.?

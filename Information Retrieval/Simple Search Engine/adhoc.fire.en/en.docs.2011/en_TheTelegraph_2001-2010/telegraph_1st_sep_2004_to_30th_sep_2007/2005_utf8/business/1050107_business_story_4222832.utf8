 Indian Airlines to lease six aircraft

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan 6: Indian Airlines (IA) today decided to lease six more 50-seater ATR aircraft and added 18 new destinations, including Cooch Behar, Ludhiana, Surat, Kanpur, Shimla, Dehradun and Jaisalmer.

 The new aircraft, to be operated by subsidiary Alliance Air, will run a feeder service to bigger cities like Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai, an IA spokesperson said. 

 IA will also run these services to Agatti, Gwalior, Nasik and Rajahmundry. The move is seen as a response to a number of small airlines, which are cropping up and eyeing high-value customers from small towns.

 The IA board has also decided to introduce an automated yield management system called Arms, defined as a computerised decision support tool for maximising flight revenues by optimising seat inventories for various classes on the basis of forecast of demand on fare-class basis.

 The appointment of P. K. Mishra, additional secretary and financial adviser in the ministry of civil aviation, on the board in place of V. Subramanian, former additional secretary and financial adviser, was also approved.

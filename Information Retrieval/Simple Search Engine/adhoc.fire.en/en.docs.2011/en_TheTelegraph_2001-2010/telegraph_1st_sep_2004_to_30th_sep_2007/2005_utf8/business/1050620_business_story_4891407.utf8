 Intelligence beats discipline

 Be smart, claim more tax benefit, says Chandralekha Tulal

 Contrary to popular belief, tax planning and investment are not always about making meticulous and disciplined moves.

 They are also about making smart moves.

 So, we have identified a way which helps you claim more tax benefit for the same amount of investment.

 The concept is simple ? just an arithmetic game ? but depends on timing it correctly.

 How does it work? Let us work it out by taking the example of an equity-linked savings scheme (ELSS).

 Now, with the Rs 10,000 limit for tax rebate gone for investing in ELSS, Tina decides to invest Rs 50,000 in such a scheme and opts for the dividend option.

 Let us assume that on the day she invested, the net asset value of the scheme was Rs 25, which means she will be allotted 2,000 units.

 Within a week, the fund declares a dividend of 100 per cent. Thus, with 2,000 units, she receives a dividend of Rs 20,000. Tina will actually have a tax-free dividend income of Rs 20,000 at her disposal, which she can either reinvest or spend. 

 Without spending the amount, she decides to invest the money back into the fund, taking her total investment to Rs 70,000.

 Sceptics might argue that such a move could be used for other investments also. For example, the interest accrued on NSC every year is considered as reinvestment and is eligible for tax benefit.

 Also, suppose Rahul invests Rs 3 lakh in a post office MIS, from which he receives an annual interest of Rs 24,000, which he uses to invest in other instruments and maybe also to pay the premium on his life insurance policy.

 Thus, just by making a one-time investment, the yield from that can be utilised to make on-going investments.

 However, the yield is an actual annual income of Rahul, whereas the dividend income of Tina could be earned just by a trick of timing. One just has to keep a watch on when a fund is declaring a dividend. And such opportunities will not be difficult to come by.

 As Dhirendra Kumar of Value Research says, ?Most funds declare dividend in the last quarter of a financial year to attract investors to the funds.

 However, till last fiscal, such payouts were comparatively lower since the funds were not in focus due to the marginal tax benefit eligibility of Rs 10,000.

 But, keeping in mind the increased investment limit of Rs 1 lakh, coupled with other benefits of tax-free dividend and high rate of return, ELSS is touted to be the next big thing. As a result, fund houses will be more aggressive in gathering assets under these schemes. A sure shot way of doing that is declaring dividends, added Kumar.

 But, beware of the pitfalls. In your haste to save on cash, do not fall for the non-performers and exercise utmost caution. 

 Always keep in mind that a one-time dividend should not be the only yardstick for investing. You should choose a fund which has been and has the potential to be a consistent performer.

 The yardstick for selecting such funds is the same for any diversified equity fund as apart from the tax benefit as an add on, these funds are on a par with regular diversified equity funds. 

 This means performance, investment style, expenses and other critical parameters are important while selecting them.

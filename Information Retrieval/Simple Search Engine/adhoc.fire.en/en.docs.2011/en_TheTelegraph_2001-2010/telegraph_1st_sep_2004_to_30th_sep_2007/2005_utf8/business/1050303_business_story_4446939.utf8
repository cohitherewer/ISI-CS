 Bharat Forge to split stock 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, March 2: Bharat Forge Ltd (BFL) is sub-dividing its shares with a face value of Rs 10 to units of Rs 2 apiece, even as it plans to raise $300 million to fund its growth plans.

 BFL, however, did not divulge further details of the mode through which these funds will be raised. Sources only indicated that the money was being raised to fund the company?s growth plans. 

 Stock market observers said the move to reduce its face value would make the scrip more accessible for retail shareholders.

 BFL shares spiked on the bourses today as investors welcomed the announcement. After opening at Rs 1349, the scrip shot to an intra-day high of Rs 1480 and thereafter finished at Rs 1417.80, a gain of 7 per cent over its last close. The counter witnessed 5275 trades with 1.29 lakh shares being transacted.

 BFL informed the stock exchanges today that it will raise resources of up to $300 million or rupee equivalent by issuing ?appropriate securities? to meet its long-term financing requirements.

 The company also said its board has decided to increase the authorised capital to Rs 105 crore from Rs 90 crore by creating an additional 15 million shares.

 BFL is also increasing the FII limit to 40 per cent from the existing 24 per cent. The company also said it will create securities under section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956, of up to Rs 1500 crore for borrowings. The borrowing powers of the board will also increase to Rs 1000 crore from Rs 500 crore.

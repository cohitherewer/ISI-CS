 Firms sure good times will last

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Sept. 8: India Inc is confident the economys fundamentals are strong enough to anchor a soaring sensex. 

 The market mood is hardly surprising since the economy and corporate performance remain promising, said Onkar S. Kanwar, president of Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci).

 Many in the industry believe the sensex leap across 8000 points has been fuelled by softer global oil prices and expectations of robust results in the second quarter. Some also see the surge as a sign of just how confident global investors are about Indias growth prospects.

 We are happy that the market has reached a historic peak. As for the automobile companies, which are one of the main drivers, I feel it clearly reflects the growth in topline and the overall uptrend in the industry, said Sanjiv Bajaj, executive director of Bajaj Auto.

 The rise in the market has largely been caused by the FII-triggered wave of liquidity, signalling confidence in the value of companies. The trend is in line with global indices, K. N. Memani, president of PHDCCI, said.

 Describing the surge in sensex as a good economic indicator, Mahendra K. Sanghi, president of Assocham said: It is our firm conviction that healthy economics and good performance of the industry will bring a boost not only to the stock markets but also to the entire economy.

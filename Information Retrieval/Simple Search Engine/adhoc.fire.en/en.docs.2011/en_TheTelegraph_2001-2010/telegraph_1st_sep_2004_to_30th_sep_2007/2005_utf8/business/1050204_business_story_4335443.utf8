 Bonds face PF rate heat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Feb. 3: The decision to hike interest rate on Employees Provident Fund (EPF) to 9.5 per cent is largely being seen in the bond market as a one-off quid pro quo between the government and the Left parties. Analysts say the move does not signal the Centre?s intention to settle for a higher level of interest rates.

 However, there is a fear among some that the EPF hike may be a prelude to an increase in small savings rates. These include post office deposits, Indira Vikas Patra and National Savings Certificates. If that indeed happens, rates across the board would go up in a chain reaction ? hitting the bond markets just where it hurts most.

 Small savings instruments hold the cash that banks compete for. A hike in interest rates on these safe-haven options could force banks to winch up their own yields.

 Today, in the aftermath of the surprise announcement on the EPF rate increase, prices of key government securities slumped more than 40 paise in early trading, though some of those losses were reclaimed later. The yield on the benchmark 10-year security fell to 6.78 per cent before recovering to 6.72 per cent.

 Analysts, however, pointed out that the drop in government security prices was not entirely due to the EPF rate. ?Other factors also played a role. There is a Rs 5000-crore auction coming up. Investor interest is limited too. Banks appear averse to enhancing their exposure to government bonds,? a money market dealer said.

 According to treasury watchers, the reaction in the bond market to EPF increase could have been sharper but for the general impression that the move was merely an attempt by the government to placate the Left parties.

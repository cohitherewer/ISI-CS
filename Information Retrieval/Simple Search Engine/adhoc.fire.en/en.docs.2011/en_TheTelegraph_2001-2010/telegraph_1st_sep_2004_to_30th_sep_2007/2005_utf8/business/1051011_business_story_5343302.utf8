 Move to bring down overseas call rates

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 10: Cellular operators have urged the government to reduce the entry fee for the new international long-distance operators.

 The Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) has said the downward revision of the fee will not only encourage competition but also bring more benefits to consumers.

 Due to limited competition in long-distance services, STD and ISD rates continue to be high. Despite a 70 per cent reduction in leased-line tariff, there has been no corresponding drop in carriage charges specified by the regulator. As a result, there has been no reduction in STD rates and no benefit has filtered down to the retail consumer.

 By cutting the entry fee for long-distance players, India will be on a par with other countries, as most of the overseas markets have only three to four access players and 15 to 20 long-distance operators. 

 Australia, France, the Philippines, Chile have 10-20 long-distance operators and the US has as many as 621 and 360 national and international long-distance players. India, on the other hand, has only four long-distance operators.

 T.V. Ramachandran, director general, COAI, said, There is an absurd anomaly that has been prevailing in the Indian market, as the wholesale rates for carriage are higher than the retail rates offered by integrated operators to their consumers. It is completely illogical that a bulk buyer of carriage had to pay a higher rate than a single individual retail consumer.

 This anomaly has been repeatedly brought to the attention of the regulator, but it has not been addressed. As a result of the regulatory inconsistency, cellular mobile operators were unable to offer competitive rates to customers.

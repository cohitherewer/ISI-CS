 Left shows iron fist to block ore exports 

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 Basu: Hard talk

 New Delhi, April 19: The Left is gearing up for another battle with the Centre over its decision to ?give away? 400 million tonnes of iron ore through state-run MMTC to Korean steel giant Posco. 

 The CPM wants to take up the issue at the highest level to block what they feel is a one-sided deal. 

 ?It is not advisable to give away precious and scarce resources of high-grade ore for processing abroad when there are enough investors who are willing to set up steel plants here,? said Nilotpal Basu, CPM leader in the Upper house.

 The PMO had recently intervened to sort out a row over Posco?s demands that it be allowed to ship 400 MT of ore to its mother plant in Korea as part of a package deal to set up a $12-billion steel plant, which would be fed by separate iron ore mines capable of supplying 600 MT over 30 years. 

 Posco had sought a separate mining concession from where it could ship ore to Korea. PMO said instead it could access the same amount of ore through metal trader MMTC. 

 Indian steel firms have long been up in arms against export of high-grade iron ore to Japan and China as these were scarce material, which needed to be conserved for use by the domestic industry. They have also argued that those who have similar reserves of either iron ore or high- grade coking coal, another necessity in steel making, hardly ever agree to sell beyond national boundaries. 

 The Left feels that when the Tatas and SAIL are planning massive expansion as are other steelmakers in the country, limited iron ore should be kept reserved for them and not exported abroad ?mindlessly?. 

 They point out that according to the Orissa government?s statistics, apart from Posco, there are applications for five mega steel projects where the capacity in each case would be more than 3 MT of steel, totalling some 21.1 MT worth some Rs 47,000 crore. 

 Besides, the state government has signed MoUs with 23 smaller steel players who will set up plants with a combined capacity of 13.81 MT at an investment of Rs 16,175 crore.

 ?These should be our first priority, not shipping ore abroad,? said Basu. 

 The Tatas and SAIL, in presentations before central government ministers and officials, have also tried to sell the same line that exports of raw iron ore hurt Indian industry and it is better to encourage value added exports. The Planning Commission has in the past supported this line of thinking.

 The commission feels the domestic steel industry is expanding and would need scarce high-class ore and this should be kept back. They have pointed out in strategy notings on earlier cabinet discussions that the Chinese have reduced exports of high-class coking coal from about 10-12 MT two years ago to just over 1 MT a year for the same reason. 

 ?A contest over scarce raw materials is emerging. We cant just go ahead and give away our strategic reserves of high-class ore even as others are doing the opposite, quot; said top officials. Instead, the commission has recommended that a policy of encouraging those who wish to import ore to set up steel making capacity here and to allow foreign direct investment in ore mining linked to such capacity building. 

 ?The aim should be to encourage value-added exports ... let them convert ore into steel for their car-making or other needs here itself, quot; officials said. 

 India and Brazil are the only nations with iron ore with an iron content between 60-65 per cent.

 This thinking came about when the government was mulling the option of removing the current cap on high-grade ore exports from the Bellary Hospet and Bailadila regions to Japan and China. 

 The move to export some 400 MT over 30 years to Posco would mean an annual increase in iron ore exports by 13-14 MT, an increase of about 33 per cent in the current levels of iron ore exports of around 40 MT.

 Hind Petro weighs LNG terminal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 22: Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) is evaluating the possibility of setting up a liquefied natural gas (LNG) import/regassification terminal of 5 million tonnes in Mangalore/Mundra, company chairman and managing director M.B. Lal said. 

 The corporation has already participated in the LNG facility put up by Shell in Hazira. Lal said the corporation will conduct a feasibility study for a terminal at Mundra. He declined to reveal further details regarding the project.

 The HPCL chief, however, added that there exists a huge demand for gas in the country and the key issue is to offer alternative sources of fuel.

 HPCL is also in talks with Shell for sourcing gas from abroad. HPCL wants to obtain LNG for marketing purposes.

 HPCLs oil exploration and production (E amp;P) initiatives through Prize Petroleum (a joint venture in association with financial institutions) is also gaining momentum.

 Lal said while Prize is looking to secure interests in E amp;P projects both at home and abroad, the joint venture is confident of going alone in the next NELP programme. The corporation participated in the bidding process of NELP-V in association with partners that included Oil India Ltd.

 CEO M.N. Prasad said Prize is eyeing a stake in an oil block in the Philippines. 

 HPCL has planned investments worth Rs 11,000 crore in the Tenth Five Year Plan period and is looking at financing options. Director (finance) C. Ramulu said HPCL is open to the idea of selling the bonds it had earlier received from the government.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Texmaco bets big on hydel power

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 26: K.K. Birla-owned Texmaco Ltd is eyeing to become a full-fledged engineering company even though the company sees its core wagon building business as main growth engine.

 The Birla firm, which is setting up a 3-mega-watt hydel power plant in north Bengal, bets big on new vistas emerging from the mini hydel power sector as government plans new capacity additions, mostly in the north-east region.

 The experience from this project will help the company to mastermind its strategy for this sector. We will take up new projects at an appropriate stage, said Saroj K. Poddar, vice chairman of Texmaco, at the sidelines of the companys 65th annual general meeting in Calcutta on Tuesday.

 The company is also looking for equity participation in hydel power projects alongside setting up projects on its own.

 At the same time, the company is also expanding its product range in the core business ? wagon building.

 Pointing out the governments decision to develop dedicated freight corridor in the country, Texmaco president Ramesh Maheshwari said that this could provide a big business opportunity for the company for its wagons.

 With GDP growth for the current year predicted at 7-8 per cent, demand for wagons would surely increase, he noted.

 Texmaco, the largest wagon manufacturer in India, has orders in hand worth Rs 550-600 crore. However, the Railways is yet to place its order with the wagon manufacturer. We are hoping to get it by August, Poddar pointed out.

 Merger buzz

 Texmaco is contemplating to merge its subsidiaries, Poddar informed the shareholders at the AGM.

 The company has four subsidiaries ? High Quality Steels Ltd, Shree Export House Ltd, Macfarlane amp; Company Ltd and Texmaco Machines Pvt Ltd.

 We are internally evaluating the merger option for some companies, Poddar said. He, however, added that no timeframe has been set.

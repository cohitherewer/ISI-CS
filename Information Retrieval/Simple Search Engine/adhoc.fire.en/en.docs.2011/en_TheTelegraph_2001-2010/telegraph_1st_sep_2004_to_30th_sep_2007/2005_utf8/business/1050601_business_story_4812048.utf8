 Petro price sums on PM table 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 31: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to discuss tomorrow the ticklish issue of raising oil prices in the wake of the soaring crude rates and fresh levies on fuel imposed in the budget.

 Economic advisory council chairman R. Rangarajan met petroleum ministry officials today to get their inputs on how petrol, diesel, kerosene and LPG prices can be raised.

 Rangarajan was informed about the financial woes of public sector oil companies as a result of the freeze on prices of petroleum products despite skyrocketing crude rates and increased duties. 

 The final decision on the matter will be taken by the Prime Minister. The Left parties have put up a staunch resistance to any price increase now. 

 Singh is likely to meet petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar and finance minister P. Chidambaram on the issue.

 The oil companies have argued that the rise in excise duty and road cess warrant a Rs 2.20-per-litre hike in the price of petrol and Rs 1.06-a- litre increase in that of diesel. They are also seeking another 25 to 30 paise per litre increase due to the higher cost of supplying Euro II and Euro III grade fuels from April 1. Part of these had to be imported as the modernisation of refineries was not over. 

 The petroleum ministry has also sought a Rs 20 per cylinder hike in LPG and Rs 3 per litre increase in kerosene prices to cut losses of over Rs 100 per cylinder on sales of the former and Rs 10.31 a litre on the latter.

 Petrol and diesel prices have remained unchanged since November 2004 despite a $10-dollar-a-barrel increase in crude rates. Kerosene prices have been steady for over three years now, while LPG prices were last revised in mid-2004.

 At a meeting last week, finance minister P. Chidambaram had discussed a number of options on petroleum product pricing and the petroleum ministry was asked to come back with some new calculations.

 He had said the meeting was inconclusive. Tomorrows session will take that process forward.

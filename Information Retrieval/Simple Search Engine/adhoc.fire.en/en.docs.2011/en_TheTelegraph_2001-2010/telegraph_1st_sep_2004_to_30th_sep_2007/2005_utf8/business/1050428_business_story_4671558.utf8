 Misra mystery

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 27: Ashok Misra?s appointment to the board of Reliance Industries would under normal circumstances have been a feather in its cap. Misra is a director of IIT Mumbai and is known as a technocrat and visionary. He has an admirer in Mukesh Ambani, chairman of RIL.

 The seeds of their friendship were sown when both were appointed as members of the taskforce on petrochemicals headed by plan panel deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia. Gurcharan Dass, ex-chairman of P amp;G and former HLL chairman S. M. Dutta were members of that taskforce. Professor Ashok Misra was then affiliated to IIT Delhi.

 At a recent convocation at IIT Mumbai, Mukesh was all praise for his friend. ?Dr Misra?s leadership has added to the lustre of a great institution. He has raised the quality of intellectual input,? he said. 

 Misra got his masters degree and doctorate from Tufts University and UMASS Amherst. He returned from Massachusetts, USA, because of family concerns.

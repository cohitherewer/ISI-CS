 Indian Oil interim payout at Rs 526 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Dec. 31: Indian Oil Corporation has paid an interim dividend of 45 per cent amounting to Rs 526 crore for the current financial year (2004-05) on the total share capital of Rs 1,168 crore.

 IOC chairman M. S. Ramachandran presented a cheque for Rs 431.13 crore representing the government?s share of the interim dividend to petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar here today.

 IOC had declared a 210 per cent dividend last fiscal on account of which the company paid out Rs 2,453 crore to its shareholders.

 For the first six months of this fiscal (April to September), IOC had recorded a net profit of Rs 2,712 crore. This was lower than the corresponding figure of Rs 2,751 crore for the same period of the preceding year.

 The profit in the second quarter of this fiscal dipped by 31 per cent to Rs 1,239 crore from Rs 1,807 crore last year as IOC had to shell out larger amounts to meet the subsidy bill on kerosene and LPG as international prices skyrocketed during this period.

 However, higher refinery margins offset part of these losses on cooking fuels and the company was still able to clock profits. The easing of international oil prices in the third quarter has come as a welcome relief to the company even though they are much higher than last year?s prices.

 The physical performance of the oil major has also shown an improvement as the refinery throughput during the first half of the current fiscal went up by 6.3 per cent to 18.8 million tonnes compared with 17.69 million tonnes during the same period of the previous year.

 IOC?s 7,730-km pipeline network too registered a 4.3 per cent increase in throughput as 22.35 million tonnes of crude oil and petroleum products were transported during the first half of this fiscal compared with 21.43 million tonnes registered in the corresponding period last year.

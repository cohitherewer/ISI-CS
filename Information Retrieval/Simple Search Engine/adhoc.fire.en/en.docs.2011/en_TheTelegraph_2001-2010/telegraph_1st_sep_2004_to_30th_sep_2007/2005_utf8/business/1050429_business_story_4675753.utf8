 Calcutta, April 28: National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) will set up a 500-MW power plant at Farakka in Bengal at a cost of Rs 2,000 crore.

 The new plant will be an extension of the existing 1600-MW power units at Farakka. 

 Under the Farakka stage I, there are three units of 200 MW each. Farakka stage II has two 500-MW units.

 Addressing a press conference here today, chairman and managing director C. P. Jain said: ?We will soon start preparing the detailed project report for the unit. Water and coal linkages have been the deciding factor for the unit. We have got in-principle approval from the Central Water Commission.?

 The company has applied for a captive coal mine block at Brahmani for the new unit. The Union coal ministry is studying the proposal.

 Farakka stage III forms a part of NTPC?s expansion programme in the Eleventh Plan Period. The corporation hopes to start construction of the unit in 2007 and complete it by 2011. NTPC will add 17333 MW capacity in the Eleventh Plan Period.

 NTPC will provide Rs 600 crore towards the equity of the new unit. The remaining Rs 1,400 crore will be met through borrowings. Bengal will consume 34 per cent of the total generation of NTPC at Farakka stage III.

 In 2005-06, NTPC has earmarked Rs 8,500 crore as capital expenditure. Of this, NTPC will provide Rs 2,720 crore from its internal accruals. The total borrowing will be Rs 5,830 crore. 

 Around Rs 4,500 crore will be raised in the country through private placement of NTPC bonds. The bonds will be issued in the third and fourth quarter of this financial year. The remaining Rs 1,300 crore will be raised through issue of Eurobonds. The schedule has not yet been decided.

 Rammam III 

 NTPC Hydro, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NTPC, today signed a memorandum of understanding with the West Bengal State Electricity Board for implementing the 90-MW Rammam Stage III in North Bengal.

 The total cost of the project is Rs 450 crore and it will be completed within 42 months.

 WBSEB will buy 85 per cent of the power from NTPC Hydro at rates to be decided by the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. In the first year, the tariff is expected to be Rs 2.10 per unit.

 The other 15 per cent of the power generated will be consumed by NTPC.

 Jain added that NTPC Hydro?s maiden venture is Lata-Tapovan power project (125 MW) in Uttaranchal.

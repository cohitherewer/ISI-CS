 Morgan chief sets an example

 New York, July 9 (Reuters): John Mack, the new chairman and chief executive officer of Morgan Stanley, on Friday told employees that he would no longer accept a $25-million guaranteed minimum pay a year, and instead would tie his compensation to the investment banks performance. 

 Earlier this week Mack had signed a five-year contract that linked his compensation to that received by CEOs of four big Wall Street rivals. 

 Under that contract, he would have received a minimum of $25 million in both 2005 and 2006 had Bear Stearns James Cayne, Goldman Sachs Henry Paulson, Lehman Brothers Richard Fuld and Merrill Lynchs Stanley Neal averaged that much. 

 Regulatory filings show, the four other CEOs received $28.2 million on an average in compensation last year. Caynes compensation totalled $24.7 million, Paulsons $29.8 million, Fulds $26.3 million, and Neals $32 million. 

 In contrast, the median US household salary from 2001 to 2003 was $43,527, according to the US Census Bureau. 

 In his letter, Mack said he would not second-guess compensation and personnel decisions made by others before he joined the company.

 I dont want anyone to think that I am entitled to something that others are not, Mack said in the letter. That is why I have decided that I will amend my employment agreement. No guarantee. No industry benchmark. 

 Mack, saying he had received questions in the last day about his own compensation, added: This business is built on trust. 

 Reuters obtained a copy of the letter. A spokesman for Morgan Stanley confirmed the letters contents. 

 Mack, named CEO on June 30, is trying to restore morale and improve performance after his predecessor, Philip Purcell, announced his retirement under pressure from shareholders, and amid a wave of defections of senior bankers. 

 It is not clear whether Morgan Stanley shareholders should be happy, said Jesse Fried, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley and executive compensation expert. 

 The devil is in the details, Fried added. 

 Shareholders are better off when CEOs are paid $100 of equity instead of $100 of cash because equity provides better incentives. But Mack may be giving up $100 of cash for equity compensation that is worth much, much more, in which case the additional incentives may come at too high a price, Fried said.

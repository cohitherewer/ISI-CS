 Calcutta, Dec. 10: Reach the spot with your CV, choose the job you want, appear for an interview and get recruited ? all within the span of a few hours. That?s how easy getting a job could be for those looking for placements in IT and ITeS sectors at Jobs Mart at Infocom 2005 organised by Nasscom and Businessworld, an ABP group publication.

 The first day of the two-day Jobs Mart saw a footfall of over 2,500 at the pavilion in the Salt Lake stadium and ?around 100? were hired by IBM, ICICI OneSource, Global Vantedge and Tata Consultancy Services.

 Compared with last year, the group of job seekers at Jobs Mart this time around is a more focused one, say recruiters and organisers alike.

 ?We met around 600 people today and the quality is much better than last year,? said Pramod Pachisia, chief operating officer of recruitment and staffing company 2Coms.

 ICICI OneSource recruited for its Mumbai, Calcutta and Bangalore offices for voice and non-voice processes. ?The response at Jobs Mart has been phenomenal. We had a huge number of walk-ins,? said Navneet Prasad, assistant manager (HR) of ICICI OneSource.

 The pre-show preparations have helped, feel organisers. ?On December 7 and 8, the recruiters made hour-long presentations to the candidates. As a result, those who came in for interviews today were clear about what they were looking for,? said a spokesperson for Jobs Mart.

 Agreed Shefali Bajaj of Global Vantedge, a call-centre company, which selected around 10 candidates out of the 120-odd who signed up for a position: ?The interactive sessions really helped screen and prepare the candidates. The facilities provided by the organisers were also very good.?

 If the recruiters were happy with the walk-in opportunities, those getting hired were ecstatic with the super-quick process.

 ?It feels really great,? gushed Somnath Sarkar, a hotel management graduate who received the first offer of the day today, from GE.

 Purnendu rushes in with Haldia stake funding plan

 Purnendu: Time is money

 Calcutta, July 25: Negotiations on Purnendu Chatterjee?s acquisition of the Bengal government?s stake in Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) have reached the final stage. 

 Purnendu today sent a detailed proposal to the Bengal government to acquire its 36.87 per cent holding ? six days before the July 31 deadline. That came along with a letter from Deutsche Bank and a contract drafted by law firm Amarchand Mangaldas. 

 The government made it clear last week that it would rethink its planned stake sale if the deadline slipped by. The proposals were faxed to Writers? Buildings ? a sign of Purnendu?s rush to honour this time limit.

 The NRI businessman would like to acquire the state?s stake through a leveraged buyout (LBO). In such deals, more than 70 per cent of the money for an acquisition is borrowed from banks and financial institutions. Purnendu has Deutsche Bank behind him.

 ?I was not in office in the second half today. So, I don?t know about the proposal,? said industries minister Nirupam Sen. However, sources in the government say the proposal is concrete and, this time, drafted in a way that addresses the government?s concerns. 

 Purnendu has apparently agreed to pay around Rs 29 per share, which will take the cost of his acquisition close to Rs 1,560 crore. With Deutsche Bank having promised Rs 1,160 crore, the remaining Rs 400 crore will have to be brought in by the NRI businessman. 

 The letter from Deutsche Bank has been attached to buttress Purnendu?s claim that he has arranged the funds. An Escrow account ? with $266 million or Rs 1,160 crore ? has been opened with the bank to facilitate the acquisition.

 There will be a separate deal to transfer the 14.5 crore shares the state government had acquired from the Tatas. 

 Purnendu?s acquisition of the government?s stake had faltered for some time due to differences on the price of HPL shares. He had also missed previous deadlines set by the Bengal government to pay up. 

 ?With these documents coming in, it seems that things are falling into place at Purnendu?s end. The state now needs to take a decision after examining the contract,? said a source close to the developments.

 Debt rejig option for sick firms

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 15: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed companies before the BIFR to be eligible for restructuring under the corporate debt restructuring (CDR) system.

 This opens another revival window for firms poor financial and commercial shape. At present, BIFR cases cannot be put through CDR, which has changed the fortunes of more than 120 entities. Domestic steel companies have been one of the biggest beneficiaries.

 Announcing the revised guidelines on CDR through a notification issued last week, the central bank said it had cleared the restructuring of firms lined up before the board. However, cases involving large amounts would be approved only if a core group within the corporate recast cell makes a recommendation.

 According to the Reserve Bank, the group will recommend exceptional BIFR cases on a case-to-case basis for consideration under the system. It should be ensured that the lending institutions complete all formalities in seeking approval from BIFR before implementing the package, the RBI notification said.

 More than 124 firms with debts of over Rs 72,000 crore have been restructured under the loan revamp cell of the Reserve Bank. Most of them have been iron and steel, sugar and textile companies.

 The inclusion of BIFR cases is only one of the many modifications made in the existing CDR mechanism. In a bid to blunt the criticism that the mechanism worked in favour of those lenders who had the maximum exposure at a consortium level, the central bank ruled that henceforth a case must also have the support of 60 per cent of the creditors, by number. Earlier, the regulation had stipulated that for a scheme to be passed, it should have the support of 75 per cent of creditors, by value. 

 A major modification made in the existing mechanism is that 60 per cent of creditors by number must support a loan revamp case, in addition to the support of 75 per cent of creditors, by value. This makes decisions more equitable, the RBI said.

 Companies indulging in frauds and malfeasance even with a single bank will continue to remain ineligible for restructuring under the mechanism. 

 In another crucial change, the RBI has put the onus of dealing with wilful defaulters in certain cases on the core group. It said the group may review the reasons for classification of a borrower as wilful defaulter, especially in old cases where classification was not transparent.

 On the creditors side, the central bank gave banks/FIs an exit option. It said a creditor outside the minimum 75 per cent and 60 per cent norm will have an exit option if it does not wish to commit fresh funds. However, such a creditor can arrange its share of additional cash to be provided by a new or existing creditor; it can, alternatively, agree to the deferment of the first years interest due to it once the corporate debt revamp package is brought into force.

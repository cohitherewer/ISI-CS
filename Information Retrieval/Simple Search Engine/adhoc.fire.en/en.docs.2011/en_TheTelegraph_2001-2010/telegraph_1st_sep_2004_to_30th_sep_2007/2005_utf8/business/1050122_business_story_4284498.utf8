 HDFC Bank raises $253 m through ADS

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 21: HDFC Bank has raised over $253 million through an offering of American depository shares (ADS) priced at $39.26 apiece. The price is equivalent to Rs 573.33 per share at the January 20 exchange rate, an HDFC Bank release said.

 Net proceeds from the offer will be used to fund future growth. HDFC Bank has also granted the underwriters an over-allotment option to purchase an additional 9,96,700 ADS. Analysts said these should fetch an extra $40 million.

 Merrill Lynch International and Morgan Stanley are the joint global co-ordinators and bookrunners for the ADS, which closes on January 25. One ADS is equivalent to three shares.

 On Thursday, HDFC Bank shares closed at Rs 509.60, on the Bombay Stock Exchange after opening at Rs 515.

 Last month, the bank had filed a document with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a $300-million ADS float.

 In the registration filing, the bank had said the net proceeds would enhance its ability to make investments and provide other financing products to customers. ?In the short term, the net proceeds will reduce our use of overnight call borrowings as a funding source,? it said.

 HDFC Bank had come out with a public issue in May 1995. This was followed by its maiden overseas public offering, comprising 1.08 crore ADS at a price of $13.83 apiece, on the New York Stock Exchange four years back. The size of the offering was $150 million. The issue was oversubscribed 7.6 times with 75 per cent of the demand coming from institutions.

 HDFC Bank recently declared a 31 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 170.9 crore for the third quarter ended December 31 against Rs 130 crore in the corresponding period last year.

 The public offering of American Depository shares comes at a time when most of the banks have declared a healthy performance for the third quarter so far. This has been attributed to strong growth in retail credit and good demand for loans from the corporate sector.

 With the economy expected to remain in a healthy mode, banks? requirement for capital is expected to increase in the days and months ahead.

 Meanwhile, ICICI Bank has also lined up a sponsored offering of American depository receipts (ADR). The issue will be up to a maximum of 6 per cent of its paid-up equity capital. Up to 44 million shares will be converted into ADRs, each of which will be equivalent to two shares. The plan, if completely successful, will see 22 million more ADRs swirling around in the US market.

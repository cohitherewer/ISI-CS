 Mumbai, Sept. 25: Graduate engineers aspiring to become a manager one day are unlikely to stay on their jobs for more than a couple of years. 

 A survey by ACNielsen ORG-Marg on campus recruitment in engineering colleges across India this year reveals that two-thirds of engineers, fresh out of colleges, are likely to leave their jobs in 2 years or less in their quest to become white collared managers.

 Covering the top twenty engineering schools in the country, the survey profiles the talent pool and identifies characteristics in their selection of employers.

 The ACNielsen ORG-Marg CampusTrack T-School 2005, the only continuous study of its kind in the country, indicates an increasing trend towards early intentional attrition amongst engineering students in India. Nearly two-thirds (64 per cent) of the respondent students who would pass out in 2006 intended to leave their first employer with in two years or less compared with 59 per cent amongst those graduated in 2005 and 47 per cent in 2004.

 A consistent trend among engineering students was their strong appetite to pursue a post-graduate management degree, more than half of all prospective engineering graduates expressed their interest in acquiring an MBA degree.

 As engineers aspire to be a core part of the businesses they join in, the ubiquitous MBA degree is therefore increasingly considered as a pre-requisite and not an add-on, said Prasenjit Das, associate director, ACNielsen ORG-Marg. 

 This trend reflects the explosion in job opportunities for skilled workers, the growing IT sector and the aspirations of todays engineering graduates, he added.

 Remuneration expectations, too, increases with the next batch of engineering graduates who expect at least 9 per cent jump in salaries compared with their previous batch. And about three-quarters of the present batch expects a salary of Rs 4 lakh per annum or more from their future employer.

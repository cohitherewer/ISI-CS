 HPL owners seek loan rejig

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Time for a change

 Calcutta, May 4: The principal promoters of Haldia Petrochemical Limited (HPL) ? Purnendu Chatterjee and the Bengal government ? have approached Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) for a loan revamp.

 The company wants to swap its high-cost debts of Rs 3,000 crore for low-cost ones. Banks and financial institutions are being paid a rate of 10-10.5 per cent for these loans. The debt-swaps will reduce interest to 8-8.5 per cent, helping HPL save on costs and boosting its bottomline.

 Chatterjee and Sabyasachi Sen, Bengal?s commerce and industry secretary, met officials of IDBI and other financial institutions last week with the loan-recast proposal.

 Sources said banks and institutions are expected to set a few riders if they agree to the debt swap. ?The company is doing well and has repaid some of the loans under its corporate debt restructuring scheme,? the sources said.

 The promoters have also put forward the proposal for Haldia Petrochem?s equity investment in Basell if a consortium led by Chatterjee is successful in winning over the Dutch company.

 Sources at the Writers? Buildings said lenders are not opposed to the idea but they would like to know how buying Basell will help Haldia Petrochem in the long run.

 Chatterjee, who is devoting his energies abroad to clinching the Basell deal, is trying to mop up funds at home for buying out the Bengal government?s stake in HPL.

 The government has offered its 36 per cent stake for a consideration of Rs 1,560 crore. If he can rustle up the money, The Chatterjee Group, the company he owns, will become the single largest shareholder of the petrochemicals company ? along with management control.

 Sources said Chatterjee is in talks with foreign investors to drum up the funds required for purchasing the Bengal government?s shares in HPL, which registered a profit of Rs 750 crore in the previous financial year.

 The Chatterjee Group chief is expected to sign a pact, which, Writers? Buildings sources say, is being given a final shape by representatives of both sides at this point of time. 

 Talks with Chatterjee are now focused on the share price to be fixed by the Bengal government, which would like to be paid Rs 30 apiece, including a premium of Rs 20.

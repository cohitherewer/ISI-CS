 Areva switches on Alstom deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Chipping in 

 Mumbai, April 7: Areva is acquiring over 86 per cent in Alstom India in a two-step process, the first of which will begin with the purchase of a 66.35 per cent stake from Alstom Holdings for Rs 80.6 crore. 

 An open offer to small shareholders, at a price of Rs 75.03 per share, will follow. This will see the French energy firm pick up 20 per cent of the shares for a consideration of Rs 59.85 crore. 

 The offer price marks a discount of 18 per cent on Rs 91.05, the closing price of Alstom Ltd?s shares on Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) today but a premium on the Rs 30.45 that Areva will pay for the stake of Alstom Holding?s.

 HSBC Securities amp; Capital Markets (India), the merchant banker picked for buying shares from investors, said the offer will be open from May 30 to June 18.

 The total cost of Rs 155 crore to be paid by Areva is in line with a valuation it carried out on Alstom Ltd ?which is the transmission and distribution unit of Alstom in India. The report, prepared by valuers N.M Raji amp; Co and Bansi S Mehta amp; Co, put the figure at Rs 153 crore. 

 Areva said buying the shares in Alstom Ltd will strengthen its position in India?s transmission and distribution business. However, it could seek board approval for a revamp leading to the sale of some assets.

 Making room

 Alstom was incorporated in 1911 as General Electric Company of India, which was merged with English Electric Company of India in April 1993 with a new name, GEC Alstom India; this was later renamed Alstom Ltd.

 The company designs and manufactures transmission and distribution equipment like electrical motors and meters. For the year ended March 31, 2004, the company made a profit of Rs 17 crore on sales of Rs 555 crore.

 Areva, on the other hand, generates nuclear power, besides turning out transmission and distribution systems. The group has a turnover of over 11,109 million euros.

 Areva?s acquisition of Alstom?s global transmission and distribution operations was cleared by anti-trust regulators in the US and Europe only in January this year.

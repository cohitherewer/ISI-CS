 Energiser for power trading 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 29: The power ministry will soon submit a draft paper to the commerce ministry with an amendment to the existing foreign direct investment (FDI) clause for electricity trading.

 At present, a 100 per cent FDI in power trading is allowed but has to be routed through the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB). The government wants an automatic route for the foreign investment.

 The new guidelines for FDI to be prepared with the assistance of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC).

 Union power minister P.M. Sayeed told the Lok Sabha in a written reply today, It has been recommended to the department of industrial policy and promotion (ministry of commerce) that the sectoral policy be further liberalised by including FDI up to 100 per cent in trading of electricity as a distinct activity on the automatic approval route.

 He said it should be subject to compliance with the provisions of the Electricity Act 2003 and the regulations of the appropriate electricity regulatory commission.

 Power ministry sources said, We are preparing a draft paper with the help of CERC to allow 100 per cent automatic FDI in power trading by removing certain clauses. This should speed up the processing of applications. Though FDI in power trading is already allowed, a few clauses need to be revised for an easy inflow of funds in the sector.

 It is difficult to set a timeframe for the revision. But we hope to send the draft paper in the next fortnight, power ministry sources said.

 If approved, the new regulation will help speed up the entry of foreign companies in power trading.

 A 100 per cent FDI is allowed for power projects relating to generation, transmission and distribution, other than atomic energy plants. There is no limit on the project cost and the quantum of FDI.

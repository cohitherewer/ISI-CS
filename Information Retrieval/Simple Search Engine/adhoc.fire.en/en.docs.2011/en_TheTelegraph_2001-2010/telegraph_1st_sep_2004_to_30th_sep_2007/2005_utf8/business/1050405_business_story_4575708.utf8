 Unocal opens talks with three suitors

 Fuel for thought 

 New York, April 4: Unocal, 

 one of the largest independent oil companies, is in talks 

 with three potential bidders, in a deal that could be worth 

 about $17.4 billion, according to executives involved in 

 the discussions. 

 The bidders were ChevronTexaco, 

 the second-largest American oil company; Eni of Italy; and 

 CNOOC, a state-owned Chinese oil company. A winner could 

 be announced in a day or two, the executives said. But they 

 cautioned that a deal might not be reached and Unocal might 

 instead enter into exclusive talks with a preferred bidder. 

 The takeover negotiations comes 

 after months of speculation over which company would end 

 up buying Unocal, the eighth-largest oil company in the 

 United States. 

 The interest generated by the 

 sale comes at a time when global energy companies are flush 

 with cash but short of fresh opportunities to develop new 

 fields as many oil-rich areas of the world remain closed 

 to foreign companies. 

 At the same time, the world?s 

 10 largest oil companies made over $100 billion in profit 

 last year thanks to crude oil that averaged $41 a barrel 

 in 2004. The boom is expected to grow this year. 

 Acquiring Unocal would give the 

 buyer a portfolio of attractive fields in Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, 

 Thailand and Indonesia, as well as in the Gulf of Mexico, 

 which are all expected to start producing this year. 

 These projects, if successful, 

 are expected to increase Unocal?s production as much as 

 10 per cent a year through 2010 ? making it one of the industry?s 

 best performers. 

 A takeover of Unocal, which is 

 based in El Segundo, California, would be the biggest acquisition 

 in the industry since the consolidation wave of the late 

 1990s. That was when Exxon bought Mobil for $80 billion 

 and BP acquired Amoco for $48 billion. 

 Interest in Unocal started earlier 

 this year when CNOOC first expressed interest in the company. 

 That sparked a discreet bidding war that sent the company?s 

 shares soaring 49 per cent since the beginning of the year 

 compared with a 20 per cent gain on the Standard amp; Poor?s 

 500-energy index. 

 Unocal has refocused its attention 

 on exploration and production, particularly in North America 

 and Asia, after selling its marketing and refining businesses 

 in the United States. Many analysts have long considered 

 it to be a candidate for a takeover. 

 They said that Unocal frustrated 

 investors in recent years, repeatedly failing to meet its 

 growth forecasts and also because of its knack for courting 

 controversy. 

 In 1998, Unocal was forced to 

 abandon plans to build a gas pipeline through Afghanistan, 

 which was then under the control of the Taliban, after the 

 United States started bombing in an effort to destroy training 

 camps of Osama bin Laden. 

 More recently, it contested and 

 then agreed to settle lawsuits accusing it in human rights 

 abuses by the army of Myanmar, during construction of a 

 pipeline there in the 1990s. 

 Unocal was founded in 1890 as 

 the Union Oil Company of California. It has about $3 billion 

 of debt.

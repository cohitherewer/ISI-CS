 Rural power energiser for Calcutta firm

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 30: Subhash Projects and Marketing Ltd will bid for the Rs 3,000-crore rural electrification projects in Rajasthan, Uttaranchal, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka.

 These projects are fully funded by the government, which ensures security of payment to companies executing them.

 Vice-chairman Subhash Sethi said he is hopeful of getting at least 10 per cent of the total tender volume.

 The tender results will be known by November. The projects will be developed over a period of 24 months after they are awarded.

 Rural electrification projects are carried out by Rural Electrification Corporation Ltd.

 Funds are allocated on a district-wise basis. Companies are not required to invest in these projects, Sethi said.

 The city-based Subhash Projects, which is into power business, has identified rural electrification as a thrust area.

 SPML is currently executing nine projects for rural electrification.

 They largely fall into two new schemes ? Accelerated Rural Electrification Programme and Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana ? announced by the government for electrification of one lakh villages and one crore households. 

 Central utilities like the Power Grid Corporation of India, Damodar Valley Corporation and others have been entrusted with the task of extending assistance in planning and execution of these schemes. 

 The contract value of the work, being executed by the company, is about Rs 363.55 crore. They are presently operating in Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

 Under these schemes, SPML will cover east Midnapur, South and North 24 Parganas in Bengal, Purnia, Araria, Kimur and Rohtas districts of Bihar and Firozabad and Mainpuri districts of UP. 

 With a focus on water management and power, the company is eyeing a fourfold increase in business in the next two years.

 Waste management

 SPMLs novel waste management project has been flagged off by Delhi chief minister Sheila Dixit. It proposes to teach citizens to dispose biodegradable and non-biodegradable waste into separate boxes, deploy trucks to carry them and dump in low land. 

 It has formed a joint venture with an US-based company, which specialises in solid waste management. 

 The Delhi authority has offered a seven-year contract with an annual business potential of Rs 60 crore to start with.

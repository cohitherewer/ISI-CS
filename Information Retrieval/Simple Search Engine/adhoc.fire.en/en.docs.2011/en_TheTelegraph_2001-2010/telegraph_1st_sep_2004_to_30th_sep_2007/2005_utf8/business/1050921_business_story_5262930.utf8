 7000 on Siemens exit door

 Berlin, Sept. 20 (AP): Siemens AG today said it will shed more than 7,000 jobs in Germany by slimming or shuttering three unprofitable units in a drive to improve earnings.

 The company said 2,400 jobs would go at its Siemens business services (SBS) by September 2007 in a drive to reduce its annual costs at that division by $1.8 billion.

 Siemens also said it would dissolve its logistics and assembly systems unit on October 1, spinning off struggling parts of the business with 5,000 employees. It said there would be more job cuts at its telecommunications equipment division.

 About 164,000 of Siemenss worldwide workforce of 430,000 are employed in Germany.

 Chief executive Klaus Kleinfeld, who took over the Munich-based firm in January, has won praise for shedding its unprofitable mobile phone unit along with 6,000 employees. BenQ of Taiwan is taking over that business.

 But mounting losses at SBS and the two other units highlighted the need for more restructuring at the company, which makes everything from power plants and mail sorting machines to high-speed trains and light bulbs.

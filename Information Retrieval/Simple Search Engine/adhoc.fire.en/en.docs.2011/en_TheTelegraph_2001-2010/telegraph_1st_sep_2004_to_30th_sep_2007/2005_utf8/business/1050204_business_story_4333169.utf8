 Qwest, MCI in merger talks

 New York, Feb. 3 (Reuters): MCI Inc and Qwest Communications International Inc are in talks that could lead to a merger, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday.

 The newspaper said Qwest, which has been in on-and-off talks with MCI for months, is offering about $6.3 billion to acquire MCI. The discussions have heated up in recent days, and the two companies have reached the point of discussing hard details like price and structure, the article said. Yet the talks remain highly fluid and could break down, the newspaper said, citing people close to the situation. Qwest and MCI could not immediately be reached for comment.

 According to the article, what could easily derail Qwest?s designs would be a bid by Verizon Communications, which is also having exploratory talks with MCI. Verizon has not yet made up its mind whether it wants to bid, the article said. Several non-corporate buyers have also approached MCI in recent months, the newspaper said.

 A spokesman for Verizon said it is the firm?s policy not to comment on rumours or speculation.

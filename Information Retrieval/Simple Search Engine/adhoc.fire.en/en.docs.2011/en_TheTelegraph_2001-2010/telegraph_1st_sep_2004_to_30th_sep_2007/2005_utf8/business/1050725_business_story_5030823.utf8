 BOC steps on the gas in southern quest

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, July 24: BOC India is setting up two air separation units ? at Bellary in Karnataka and Medak in Andhra Pradesh ? to penetrate the lucrative southern market.

 The company has signed a long-term contract with JSW Steel to supply gas to its steel plant from the Bellary on-site plant in Karnataka. 

 The producer of industrial gases is also setting up a standalone air separation unit at Medak in Andhra Pradesh.

 While the Bellary unit will have a capacity of 855 tonnes per day (tpd), the Medak unit will produce 65 tpd.

 However, the Bellary unit will have an additional capacity of 200 tpd of liquid products for merchant sale. The Medak facility near Hyderabad will also be exclusively for merchant sale.

 The decision to consolidate its presence in the south stems from the fact that a number of pharmaceutical and automobile companies have set up their manufacturing units there. These are all potential customers for BOCs products and services.

 In the absence of its own production facilities for industrial gases in the region, BOC had a distinct cost disadvantage. 

 The Bellary and Medak units, catering to the merchant market, will help overcome this lacuna to a large extent. 

 The work on Bellary unit has just begun and the facility is likely to go on stream by the middle of 2006. The Medak unit will come up earlier. It will start commercial production before March next year.

 The foray into the southern market comes at a time when BOC is in the process of restructuring its gas business. BOC Indias gas business has been separated into process gas solution (PGS) and industrial and special products (ISP) divisions in line with the BOC groups global strategy.

 The PGS division will focus on customers requiring bulk supplies of industrial gases from on-site plants or by pipeline as well as deliveries of liquefied gases. 

 The project engineering division, dealing with customers in different industries, forms an integral part of the PGS business. 

 The ISP division, on the other hand, will take care of the sale of the products in cylinders and liquid gas sales to the fabrication and medical sectors. Special products like helium and calibration gases also forms part of the ISP product portfolio.

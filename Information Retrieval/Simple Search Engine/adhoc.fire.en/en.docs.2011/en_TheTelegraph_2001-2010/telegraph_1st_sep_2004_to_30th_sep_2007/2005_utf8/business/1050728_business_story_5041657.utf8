 Calcutta, July 27: Shalimar Paints will set up a new manufacturing unit in south India.

 The company is planning to invest around Rs 15-18 crore in a greenfield plant near Bangalore. The plant will manufacture both decorative and industrial paints.

 The company has three plants in Howrah, Nashik and Sikandrabad. A fourth unit will strengthen Shalimar Paints position in the lucrative southern market, director Ratan Jindal said on the sidelines of the companys 103rd annual general meeting.

 The company is also considering technical tie-ups with overseas companies, Jindal added. However, he refused to name the companies for reasons of confidentiality.

 Once the fourth unit is set up, Shalimar Paints capacity will rise to 40,000 kilolitres from 33,000 kl.

 Going forward, the company plans to emphasise on the top-of-the line products in the decorative segment as they deliver better margins than the products in the economy range. 

 Decorative paints constitute 75 per cent of the total paints business of Shalimar.

 The company is also drawing up aggressive plans to install tinting systems called Colorspace at showrooms to sell the premium decorative paints.

 Shalimar will also focus on the industrial paints business, which grew 35 per cent last year. The industrial coating segment, in particular, grew by more than 48 per cent last year.

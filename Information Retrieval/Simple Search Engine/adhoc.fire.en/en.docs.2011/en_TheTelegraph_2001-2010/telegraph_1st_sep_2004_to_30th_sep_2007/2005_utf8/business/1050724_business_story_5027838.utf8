 Securities tribunal chief steps down

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 23: Securities Appellate Tribunal head Justice Kumar Rajaratnam has resigned amid controversy over the UBS Securities case relating to the stock market crash last year.

 The resignation coincides with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) rejecting the suggestion from SAT to allow UBSs plea bargaining for a possible amicable settlement and comes within days of Justice Rajaratnam excusing himself from the case.

 The plea bargaining system is popular in the US. It allows offences to be compounded and a penalty to be imposed on the errant firm. 

 Asked why he has put in his papers, Rajaratnam told a news agency that: I have no comments to offer. There is no difference with Sebi, and Sebi has co-operated with us.

 I do my judicial duties and they (Sebi) do theirs. UBS issues will go in accordance with the law, he added. 

 He was responding to queries whether the resignation had anything to do with the growing differences between SAT and Sebi over the case.

 During the course of hearing on July 18, Justice Rajaratnam had suggested that Sebi consider the plea bargaining and a penalty of Rs 50 crore on UBS Securities, a foreign institutional investor that was banned from issuing overseas derivative instruments for its alleged involvement in May 17, 2004 stock market crash.

 Sebi officials said they did not have any idea about the SAT chiefs action and clarified that the statement of market regulators counsel Rohit Kapadia to the media could not be purported to be from Sebi.

 A Sebi spokesperson has already clarified this. In fact, Sebi has sought adjournment from the court on the UBS case as it was seeking a new senior counsel, a Sebi official said.

 Sebi counsel Kapadia had told media that his client (Sebi) was not interested in the suggestion made by SAT with respect to plea bargaining and would like the case to continue under 11(b) of the Sebi Act, 1992.

 Irked over the manner in which his suggestion was rejected through media without first informing the court (the tribunal), Rajaratnam excused himself from hearing the case.

 Since suggestion (for amicable settlement) came from me, it would not be appropriate for me to hear the matter and I excuse myself from the case, Justice Rajaratnam had said in a short order on July 20.

 Sebi had banned UBS Securities Asia from further issuing participatory notes for one year for alleged non-compliance with certain regulatory requirements.

 In February last year, the finance ministry had appointed Justice Rajaratnam as the presiding officer of SAT for five years or till he attained 68 years, whichever was earlier.

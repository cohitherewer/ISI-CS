 Anil fires another salvo at Jain

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 13: Anil Ambani has renewed his attack on Anand Jain, a close confidant of elder brother Mukesh.

 In a letter to the Reliance Industries chairman, who is also the chief of Indian Petrochemicals Corporation (IPCL), Anil said Jain, a director in the group firm, was also acting as a distributor. 

 Anil calls this an obvious conflict of interest and has asked Mukesh to guide him, sources close to the younger Ambani said. On January 3, Anil had resigned as vice-chairman of IPCL, saying it was ?below his dignity? to work with Jain. He had also accused Jain of conspiring to divide the family.

 The fresh attack came even as reports suggested that a formula for legal separation was being worked out by ICICI Bank chairman K. V. Kamath at the behest of Kokilaben ? Dhirubhai Ambani?s widow.

 Reliance Industries officials were unwilling to comment on the fresh broadside directed at Jain. An agency report quoted sources in Anil?s camp as saying that Jain?s dealings with IPCL and RIL were hurting the image of thegroup.

 Jain is considered a close confidant of Mukesh and has a major influence on him. Anil feels this is at the root of their differences.

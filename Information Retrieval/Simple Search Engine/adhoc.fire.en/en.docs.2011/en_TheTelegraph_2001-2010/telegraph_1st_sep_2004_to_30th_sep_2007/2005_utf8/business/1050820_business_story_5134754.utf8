 Exchange offer: BSE turns into stock

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Moving with the times

 Mumbai, Aug. 19: An initial public offering by Bombay Stock Exchange ? the oldest bourse in Asia ? could see its own shares being traded on the exchange, if everything goes to plan.

 The iconic 131-year-old market today donned the mantle of a corporate entity, following other leading global bourses, including the National Stock Exchange. The much younger bourse has outpaced BSE on turnover, in both cash and the futures and options segments.

 A more nimble governing board of 12 members, instead of 21, will run the exchange; only a third of the board will consist of brokers. Thus, the character of the exchange will change from an association run by stock brokers.

 The chief of BSE, Rajnikant Patel, says the divestment of stake is a ?regulatory requirement?, as it has to be brought down to 49 per cent. Money raised that way could be used partly for diversifying into other areas, he added. The strategic investor could be a foreign stock exchange. Recently, there has been a lot of consolidation between bourses as they are merged or acquired. An Australian bank, for instance, has bid for the London Stock Exchange.

 The ?association of persons? structure is now a thing of the past and the corporatisation will make it a corporate entity from a non-profit Trust earlier. The brokers? holding could be brought down either through an IPO, including an overseas listing, or a combination of a flotation and stake sale to strategic investors, he said.

 A listing will allow BSE to go one up on the NSE, which is still a closely held entity with shares owned by institutions.

 On the IPO plans, Patel said 10-12 merchant bankers have made a presentation. Their appointment as advisers/managers is expected in a month. 

 The business plan, too, willbe firmed up in a month. Exchange officials are working on it and could hire a consultant to help them in the task, Patel added. 

 Meanwhile, the markets saw a correction and closed in the red after a 15-week bull run. The sensex shed around 31 points after losing 48 points on Thursday. It opened a shade higher at 7817.74 and rose to a high of 7867.89. Later, it declined to a low of 7760.69, before finishing at 7780.76, a fall of 0.39 per cent over the Thursday?s close of 7811.33.

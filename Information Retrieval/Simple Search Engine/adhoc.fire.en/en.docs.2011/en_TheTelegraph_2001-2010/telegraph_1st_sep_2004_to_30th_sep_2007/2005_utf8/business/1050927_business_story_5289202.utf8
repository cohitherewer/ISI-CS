 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Sept. 26: Hutchison Telecom today entered into a deal with the Essar group to acquire BPL Mumbai, BPL Cellular and Essar Spacetel for $1.15 billion (about Rs 4,900 crore).

 Essar and its associates had purchased a 64 per cent stake in BPL Cellular for $1.1 billion (Rs 4,400 crore) in July.

 Essars stake in the Hutch-Essar JV remains unchanged at 30.43 per cent.

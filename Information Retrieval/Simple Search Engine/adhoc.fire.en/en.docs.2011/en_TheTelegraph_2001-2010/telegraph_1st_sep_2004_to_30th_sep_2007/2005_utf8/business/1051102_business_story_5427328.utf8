 Power club to fund new projects

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Nov. 1: Power Finance Corporation has teamed up with Life Insurance Corporation and 10 nationalised banks to jointly finance power projects as a consortium.

 The consortium will take up projects with a minimum exposure of about Rs 100 crore. However, it will be eager to lend to projects worth Rs 60,000 crore to Rs 70,000 crore.

 The power sector needs around Rs 8,00,000 crore by 2012 to achieve its target of adding 1-lakh-mw capacity in the power sector.

 Senior PFC officials said the consortium would offer a single window opportunity to developers of power projects in accessing funds for their projects.

 Under this system, loan disbursals will be quick as the consortium will follow a single appraisal system by PFC. The existing arrangement gets multiple appraisals by independent agencies for the same project, they added.

 Banks and FIs are also keen to finance the power sector following the governments decision to set up a central monitoring system to keep a tab on the progress of ongoing projects. The surveillance system will focus on slippages in project clearance and construction scheduling.

 The large coal reserves in the country provide a ready and economical resource and energy security. Hence, coal has been identified as the mainstay fuel for power generation till 2012.

 Captive power

 The power ministry and the Central Electricity Authority have launched a crucial exercise to bring in at least 5,696 mw of surplus power available with the captive power plants in the national grid.

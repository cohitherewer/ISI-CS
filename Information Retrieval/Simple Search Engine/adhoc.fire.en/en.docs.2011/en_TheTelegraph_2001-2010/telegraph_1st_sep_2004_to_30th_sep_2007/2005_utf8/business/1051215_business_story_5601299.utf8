 New Delhi, Dec. 14: Adobe Systems will increase its headcount in India by more than 350 in its new business unit in the country.

 The new print and publishing unit in India will function independently and will work towards the future development of Adobe existing products in the country. This unit will be fully responsible for the development of about 12-14 products of the company.

 An Adobe spokesperson claimed that the unit would be the first instance where a global software giant has allowed its offshore arm to operate independently in India. Adobe has six business units in the United States. 

 Naresh Gupta, senior vice-president (print and classic business unit) and managing director, Adobe India, said, This is a new responsibility given to us based on the trust that our employees in India centre have shown to the parent company. Currently we have about 650 employees, it would go past 1000 soon.

 He added that the India centre would continue to develop and innovate software and enhance support levels to Adobes customers.

 The company also announced today the completion of its acquisition of Macromedia for $3.4 billion.

 Bruce Chizen, CEO of Adobe, said, The explosion of digital content combined with the increased proliferation of mobile phones, wireless devices and the growth of broadband are transforming the way the word engages with information.

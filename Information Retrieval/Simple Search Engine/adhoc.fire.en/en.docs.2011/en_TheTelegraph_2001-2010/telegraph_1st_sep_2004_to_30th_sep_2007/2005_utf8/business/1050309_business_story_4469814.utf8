 Bickson: New horizon

 Mumbai, March 8: Inspired by the success of its first indiOne hotel in Bangalore, Indian Hotels Co Ltd today announced the rollout of indiOne at 10 new locations across the country.

 ?The construction work for 10 hotels will start in two months, and they will be operational by the first quarter of the next fiscal,? IHCL managing director Raymond Bickson said today. The 10 locations for indiOne are Pune, Nashik, Mysore, Haridwar, Panjim, Bhubaneswar, Varanasi, Thiruvananthapuram, Jamshedpur and Durgapur. 

 The indiOne hotel at Haridwar will come up first, said Shiela Nair, the chief operating officer of Roots Corporation, an Indian Hotels subsidiary for executing indiOne. 

 ?The estimated cost for a indiOne hotel is around Rs 10 crore. The hotels will have a 100-room facility,? he added.

 Since its launch in June 2004, the first indiOne hotel in Bangalore has achieved an average occupancy of over 85 per cent, Nair said. indiOne hotels are scalable. These hotels will offer a choice of single, twin and queen-sized rooms.

 The hotels, created along with corporate strategy thinker C. K. Prahalad, are designed with the concept of ?smart basics?. 

 Priced at Rs 900 for a single room and Rs 950 for a double room, the indiOne has created a new category in the domestic hospitality landscape.

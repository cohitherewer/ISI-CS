The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 LabVantage to hire more

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 15: LabVantage Solutions, a global provider of laboratory information management systems and an affiliate of The Chatterjee Group, plans to double its Calcutta headcount in the next two years.

 We would like to utilise the phenomenal talent pool in Bengal, LabVantage CEO James Aurelio said. The New Jersey-based company has 85 people at its centre of excellence in Calcutta, which is half of its global workforce.

 We also plan to expand the 8,500-sq-ft set-up that we have at the Bengal Intelligence Park by next year, Aurelio said. We share the Bengal governments dream of developing the IT sector here, he added.

 The Calcutta base is the companys hub for software development, solution implementation, client support and sales throughout the Asia Pacific region, including India, Thailand, China, Singapore, Korea, Taiwan and Malaysia.

 LabVantage counts pharmaceutical majors such as Pfizer and Aventis as its global clients, while in India it offers solutions and services to companies like Indian Oil, GAIL and Reliance. It is also in talks with the CSIR labs and forensic units in the country.

 We develop systems and services that allow our customers to bring more economic products to the market. Our flagship product, Sapphire, can particularly help those Indian companies that are wrestling with how to get their products sooner and better to the market.

 LabVantage plans to double its revenues in the next 12 months. The global market for laboratory information management systems is worth $225-250 million and LabVantage is one of the four companies occupying 60 per cent of the market together, Aurelio said. The other three are Thermo, Labware and Starlims.

 We expect a double-digit growth in 2005, Aurelio said, adding that the company draws 60 per cent of its revenues from North America, 35 per cent from Europe and the remaining 5 per cent from emerging markets like India.

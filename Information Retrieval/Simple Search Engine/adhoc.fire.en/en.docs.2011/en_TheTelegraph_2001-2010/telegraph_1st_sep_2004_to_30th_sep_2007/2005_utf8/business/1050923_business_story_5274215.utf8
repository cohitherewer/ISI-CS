 Jessop rights to come out of BIFR

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Sept. 22: Jessop amp; Co will come out with a Rs 50-crore rights issue to take the company out of the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR).

 The fresh capital will make the networth positive, which is a pre-requisite for coming out of BIFR. It will also help meet the working capital requirement of the company and enable it to bid for bigger projects and contracts and get bank loans.

 Ruia holds a 72 per cent stake in the company while 27 per cent is with the government. The public holds the remaining 1 per cent.

 The company is still listed with the Calcutta Stock Exchange (CSE).

 The board decided yesterday to issue fresh shares with a face value of Re 1 in the ratio of 5.5:1.

 After the issue, the capital base will grow to Rs 59.9 crore while the loss in the books will be Rs 33 crore. Jessop has recently reduced its share capital from Rs 95 crore to Rs 9.5 crore. As a result, the accumulated loss has come down from Rs 118 crore to the present level.

 If the government declines to put in its share of funds ? and it is likely that the Centre will not subscribe to new shares ? Ruia companies are willing to chip in the money.

 According to the shareholders agreement (SHA) signed during the divestment, the combined shareholding between us and the government has to be 99 per cent. So, we are willing to put in the money, Ruia said.

 The agreement also mentions that the government has to make an offer to part with its existing stake in the company after August 29, 2006.

 In such a scenario, the government is likely to renounce its obligation in the rights issue with Ruia.

 The company would request BIFR to exempt it from the formal process that the Securities and Exchanges Board of India (Sebi) calls for in case of a rights issue.

 This will save us money as well time to come up with the issue, he added.

 The company wants Rs 70 crore for working capital, Rs 30 crore for capital expansion and another Rs 50 crore for opening line of credit (LC) and providing bank guarantee for the next couple of years. The rights issue will help meet some of these demands.

 The fresh capital infusion was also warranted because payment for its supply to the Railways got stuck. According to the calculations made by the company, the Railways owes Rs 27 crore to Jessop.

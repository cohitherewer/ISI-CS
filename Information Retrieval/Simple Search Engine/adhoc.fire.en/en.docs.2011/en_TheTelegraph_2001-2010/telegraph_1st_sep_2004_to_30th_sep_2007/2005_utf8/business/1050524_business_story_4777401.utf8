 Calcutta, May 23: Infrastructure Leasing amp; Financial Services Ltd (IL amp;FS) will pump in Rs 5,000 crore to develop infrastructure projects in Bengal.

 This was announced by state commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen after West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) signed a shareholders agreement with IL amp;FS to set up a 50:50 joint venture company.

 The JV, which is yet to be named, will comprehensively focus on industry-related and other supporting infrastructure under the West Bengal Industrial Infrastructure Development Programme.

 This is the fifth joint venture that the government has formed to develop the sector. The other four are I-win with ICICI, Bengal Sri, Bengal Pragati and Bengal-CES.

 The new company will have a paid-up capital of Rs 5 lakh, which will be equally contributed by both the partners. The government has identified projects that will be financed by IL amp;FS.

 One of them is the Eastern Link Highway project, which will connect NH-34 and NH-117. The project would design, finance, build, operate and maintain a two-lane highway to start with and will be upgraded to a four-lane one as the traffic builds up. The initial cost of the highway project is Rs 1,500 crore, which may go up with upgradation.

 The other important projects include IT, biotechnology and financial knowledge complexes in and around Calcutta, a health city near Sonarpur, an agro business-cum-border trade park at Siliguri, and infrastructure development and a chemical hub at Haldia.

 Sen said the government has identified a 500-acre plot between the Dum Dum airport and Rajarhat to set up the IT park. The land acquisition is yet to begin.

 IL amp;FS has already decided to put in Rs 50 crore to develop the infrastructure at Haldia.

 For the knowledge city and health city, WBIDC and IL amp;FS will put in Rs 1 crore each, Sen said. A group of non-resident Indians has shown interest to set up the health city.

 A special purpose vehicle will be set up for investment in these projects. We will then carry out the financial closure of the projects, said R. Parthasarathy, IL amp;FS chairman and managing director.

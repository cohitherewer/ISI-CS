 World Bank prop for rural infrastructure

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 19: World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz today met finance minister P. Chidambaram and plan panel deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia and discussed the funding possibilities for the Rs 1,74,000-crore Bharat Nirman rural infrastructure building programme. 

 The project will use labour from the recently introduced rural employment guarantee scheme to build infrastructure, roads and irrigation facilities.

 The government wants soft loans from the World Bank to fund the rural infrastructure programme so that the employment guarantee scheme can be launched before the Assembly elections in Bihar, Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The scheme is likely to be showcased as the new deal for the poor during these elections.

 ?We could absorb around $1 billion (Rs 4,500 crore) in soft loans for the Bharat Nirman programme,? Ahluwalia said after a 45-minute meeting with the World Bank president. Wolfowitz was briefed about the infrastructure building programme, growth prospects of different sectors and the financing of plans, he added. ?We also discussed agriculture issues,? he said.

 Wolfowitz met Ahluwalia after a detailed meeting with finance ministry officials, including Chidambaram. ?We had good meetings ... we have been discussing what more the World Bank can do to support the challenge of scaling up rural infrastructure,? Wolfowitz said. World Bank currently lends about $3 billion to India but has indicated that it can step up the figure if needed. The bank has also agreed to provide a $325-million loan for a water project in Maharashtra.

 The government wants the World Bank to step up lending in the coming years to fund infrastructure projects, including the ?flagship? Bharat Nirman plan. 

 Chidambaram has admitted that while the Centre would be able to find funds for the rural employment guarantee scheme this fiscal, ?next year extra money would have to be found?.

 The government had budgeted Rs 4,500 crore for this fiscal for the scheme. North Block officials feel this sum will be sufficient for the four months during which the programme would run this fiscal.

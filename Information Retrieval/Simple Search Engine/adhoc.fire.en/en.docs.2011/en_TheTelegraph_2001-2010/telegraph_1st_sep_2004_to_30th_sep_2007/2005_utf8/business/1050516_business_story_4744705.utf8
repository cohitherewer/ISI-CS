The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Growth pace to double

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 15: Organised retail business in India is expected to double its growth by 2010.

 At present, organised retailing is growing at 3 per cent, which is estimated to be worth $6 billion. This figure is expected to touch $17 billion in the next five years at a growth rate of 6 per cent, revealed a study conducted by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham).

 Organised retailing is all set to grow at a much faster speed than the unorganised market. Also, higher growth alone will be responsible for a bigger market share, said chamber president Mahendra K. Sanghi.

 Seeing the countrys potential in this business, worlds biggest retail-chain head, John Menzer, president and CEO of Wal-Mart International, recently made a two-day visit to India. Cities likely to show a boom in retailing, include Calcutta, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and Kanpur.

 The survey said shopping malls in these cities would be largely developed on build, operate, lease and sell basis. There would be a close link between real-estate developers, state governments, financial institutions and the retail industry, it added. 

 According to the chambers estimates, investment opportunities created by the retail sector over the next 4-5 years will jack up the urban growth. This, in turn, will increase the per capita income, leading to greater consumerism. Retail growth would lead to a greater shift towards service economy. Subsequently, there will be a boom in real estate. 

 The survey found that franchisees would become popular in retailing because there will be a proliferation of brands. Both foreign and Indian companies will acquire a strong brand equity for their products in the near future. 

 However, the survey suggests that there are a few stumbling blocks, which restrict the retail growth. It includes steep stamp duties on transfer of property, which vary from state to state. Also, some laws, including the urban land ceiling act, rent control and land acquisition acts continue to distort real-estate markets and lead to high property prices.

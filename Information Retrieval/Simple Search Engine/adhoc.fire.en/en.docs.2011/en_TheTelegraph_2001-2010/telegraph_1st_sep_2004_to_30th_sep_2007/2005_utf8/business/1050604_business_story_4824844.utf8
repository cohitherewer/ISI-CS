 Calcutta, June 3: Allied Domecq Spirits amp; Wine, the Indian arm of the UK-based Allied Domecq, has drawn up an aggressive expansion plan.

 ?We shall close our financial year (September 04-Aug ust 05) with a 25 per cent overall growth to 90,000 cases from last year?s 74,000 cases,? said Harish Moolchandani, managing director, Allied Domecq Spirits amp; Wine.

 The Indian arm has recorded a 30 per cent growth in the sales of Teacher?s 50 and a 22 per cent for Teacher?s Highland Cream. ?While the total market for Scotch whisky in India has grown by 13-15 per cent, the market share for Teacher?s has grown from 40 to 45 per cent,? said Moolchandani.

 In the imported spirits category, it has witnessed an increase of 35 per cent to 40,000 cases compared with 28,000 cases in the previous fiscal. ?The increased sales in the imported spirits can be largely attributed to the increased tourism within the country. Over 70 per cent of the total sales comes from the duty-free shops,? Moolchandani explained. Another 15 per cent come from the airlines sales, while the remaining 15 per cent from the retail sales.

 ?We expect the same momentum to continue in the next year, too, and we will be more aggressive in making our brands visible,? he emphasised.

 Allied Domecq has launched Curtis No.1 in the northern India including Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal. ?The initial response has been encouraging and, in the next fiscal, we plan to introduce it in the western and southern markets simultaneously. However, we shall wait for one more year before launching it in the eastern market,? he said.

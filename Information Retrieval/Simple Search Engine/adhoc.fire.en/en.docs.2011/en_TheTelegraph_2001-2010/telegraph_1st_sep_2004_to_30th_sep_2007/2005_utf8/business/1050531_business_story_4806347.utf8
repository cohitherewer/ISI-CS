 ThinkPad centres spread far amp; wide

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 30: Lenovo India and IBM today announced plans of setting up service and support centres at non-metro locations in the country. 

 As a part of this initiative, five new full-fledged ThinkPad service centres have been opened in Lucknow, Jaipur, Chandigarh, Indore and Kochi. These centres are equipped with the necessary infrastructure and manned by IBM trained engineers. Customers will be able to get their ThinkPad notebooks serviced at these locations.

 IBM will continue to provide its service and support to ThinkPad and ThinkCentre products within the Lenovo-IBM alliance framework.

 In addition to this, 10 drop-off and pick-up centres have been set up where customers can drop and pick up their ThinkPad notebooks, which require servicing from the same location. These centres are located in Coimbatore, Pondicherry, Mysore, Vijayawada, Vishakapatnam, Nagpur, Surat, Baroda, Bhopal and Guwahati.

 For fixing the hardware, customers can call on the IBM SmartCentre at 1600 44 6666 and will be directed to one of these centres. 

 To help customers purchase projectors from Lenovo, the company has introduced the rapid replacement service scheme. 

 The new service centres are reflective of IBMs commitment to ThinkPad customers and illustrative of how the company views and supports the strategic partnership with Lenovo, said Ramesh Narasimhan, country manager, services sales, IBM Global Services, India.

 One of the first things we are doing at Lenovo is to reach out to our entire market and ensure that customers experience superior service. Now, in addition to the 10 existing ThinkPad service centres, we have 15 locations for ThinkPad customers to reach Lenovo, said Anil Philip, director, marketing and strategy at Lenovo India.

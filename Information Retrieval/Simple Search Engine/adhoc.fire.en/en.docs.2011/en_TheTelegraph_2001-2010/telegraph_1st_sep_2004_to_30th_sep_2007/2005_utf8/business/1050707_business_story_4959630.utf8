 Ford Family Plan to check sales slide

 Buyers delight

 Detroit, July 6 (Reuters): Ford Motor Co, bowing to pressure from General Motors Corp and hoping to end a long losing streak, said on Tuesday it was matching the big consumer incentives programme that delivered blockbuster sales for GM last month. 

 Ford announced its new marketing campaign just hours after GM said it was extending its Employee Discount for Everyone deals through August 1. 

 The Chrysler arm of DaimlerChrysler is expected on Wednesday to also match the GM programme, as it too responds to marketplace pressures brought on by the worlds largest automaker. 

 The GM move was widely expected and set the stage for another intensification of Detroits long-running price war. Under the programme, which was launched last month, GM is selling anybody a 2005 model car or truck at the same low price that GM employees pay. 

 Ford spokesman David Reuter said the Ford Family Plan ? which takes effect on Wednesday and will also run through August 1 ? would be similar to GMs and shave thousands of dollars off the sticker prices of most 2005 models. 

 The GM programme, which resonated with consumers, drove the automakers June sales up 41 per cent and delivered the company its best sales month in almost 19 years. 

 Fords sales fell for the 13th straight month, meanwhile, and it can ill afford not to remain competitive with its larger, cross-town rival. 

 We are going to advertise this widely in a huge, significant way throughout the month, said Reuter. Its pretty clear from what GM has done that customers like a great deal delivered in a very simple, clear way.

 Fords only hot-selling car, the all-new Mustang, will not be included in the Family Plan programme, Reuter said. Gas-electric hybrid versions of its Escape sport utility vehicle are also excluded. 

 GMs programme resonated with consumers because of its simplicity and because it eliminated the haggling over prices that many consumers dread.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Courier firms assess damage

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Aug. 2: The torrential rains that swept across Mumbai and parts of Maharashtra have affected courier and logistics companies. Their warehouses were damaged due to flooding and business was lost due to the downpour.

 Commutation within the city became difficult since last Tuesday and movement of cargo to and from the countrys commercial capital also paralysed as airports remain shut due to inclement weather. 

 Speaking to The Telegraph, Chris Callen, country manager, DHL Express India Pvt Ltd, said while the company could not make deliveries, it did work overtime to ensure that customer business was not interrupted. 

 Acknowledging that the rains meant a loss of a weeks business, he pointed out that DHL kept its operations open on the weekend, including Sunday, with its shipment pick-up, customer service and express centres trying to ensure that businesses and individuals regained lost time. 

 While one of DHLs godowns was also flooded, Callen did not divulge the financial losses that the company has suffered. Mumbai contributes close to 27 per cent of the companys business in the country.

 Overall, it was a remarkable team effort, he said and applauded the measures taken by the companys employees to bring normalcy.

 An official from another courier and logistics company said some of their godowns were flooded entailing a loss of revenue so far as logistics were concerned. 

 Logistics covers activities relating to procurement, transport, transhipment and storage of goods.

 The official said there was no movement of consignment. For five days, goods transportation was stuck. It meant a loss of revenue for us on the logistics front. We are now in the process of assessing the warehouse damages caused by the deluge.

 Pilani meet turns heat on Birlas

 Birla: Facing the fire

 Calcutta, Sept. 1: Settling scores through annual general meetings seems to have become a rule and the Birlas tasted today what R.S. Lodha has been facing for the past two years. 

 At the AGM of Pilani Investment and Industries Corporation, minority shareholders raked up the issue of mismanagement in the investment arm of the Birla clan.

 Lodha, in charge of Birla Corporation and engaged in a bitter legal battle with the Birlas, had faced similar charges at the firm?s past two meetings.

 Sailesh Saraf, a Mumbai shareholder, accused the Birlas ? who hold a 58 per cent stake ? of running Pilani like a private company and a ?fiefdom? of B. K. Birla despite the fact that it is listed. Lodha, by contrast, controls the MP Birla group?s 25 per cent stake in the company. 

 ?Lodha?s men were there and raised some issues,? said a confidant of the Birla family at the meeting. The similarities with what happened at Birla Corp came through more sharply when some shareholders knocked on the doors of the company law board and Calcutta High Court over issues of corporate governance. 

 Questions were raised on how Lodha, an accused in criminal proceedings, could head Birla Corporation. While Lodha wages the will war in courtrooms, the Birlas have been accused of mismanagement. 

 None from the Birla family was present at the hour-long AGM, chaired by P. K. Khaitan of Khaitan amp; Co. 

 Questions were also raised on how company funds were being used in Birla VXL and Birla Caustic and Chemicals. Around Rs 48.75 crore was invested in S. K. Birla?s Birla VXL but written off in two years in a move that inflicted losses on Pilani. The holding company also had to suffer when it skipped the rights issue of Bihar Caustic and Chemicals.

 The Lodha camp even forced a poll on all seven resolutions, including reappointment of B. K. Birla and K. K. Birla as directors on the board. The lack of unanimity was also evident in the past two AGMs of Birla Corp. 

 Some shareholders sought greater liquidity in the Pilani shares, which have not changed hands for the past two years. Since 12 per cent of the firm?s equity is with the public, they suggested the stock ? now listed on the Delhi and Indore bourses ? could be listed on BSE Indonext. Khaitan said the board would consider the issue at its next meeting in October.

 Investment value

 Pilani?s annual report of 2005-06 revealed that the market value of the unquoted investment of the company stood at Rs 1,815.47 crore for 2004-05. 

 Going by this valuation, 27 per cent of Pilani, bought out by B.K. Birla and his grandson Kumar Mangalam Birla from S.K. Birla and GP-CK Birla combine, should be valued at Rs 490 crore. 

 Aditya Investment, the company controlled by BK and Kumar, paid much less to GP-CK and S.K. Birla. B.K. Birla had gone on record saying he and Kumar paid Rs 300 crore to buy the 27 per cent stake.

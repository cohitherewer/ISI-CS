 Century sizzles on Pilani pact

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Aug. 4: The palaver on Pilani is finally over.

 The stock markets did a whoopee after learning that the three Birla clans ? represented by Basant Kumar, Sudarshan and Chandrakant Birla ? had finally reached an agreement on untangling the crossholdings in a large swathe of Birla companies that were held through investment arm, Pilani Investment and Industries Corporation.

 Century Textiles leapt to a 52-week high on the bourses closing at Rs 355, up Rs 20.80, or 6.61 per cent. Century is the biggest beneficiary from the deal since Pilani holds a 36.2 per cent stake in the textile maker.

 S.K. Birla and the GP-CK Birla clans have exited from Pilani; K.K. Birla, who holds a little over 7.5 per cent in the investment company, has also agreed to sell his stake. This means the BK-Kumar Birla combine will have unfettered control over the Rs 2,677-crore textile maker, which has over 20,000 employees. It earned a net profit of Rs 109.6 crore in the year ended March 31.

 At todays closing price, Pilanis investment in Century alone would be worth Rs 1,134 crore. Interestingly, going by the money forked out by B.K. Birla and his grandson, Pilani itself would be valued at Rs 1,100 crore to Rs 1,200 crore.

 If Pilanis investment in other group companies, where it has more than 1 per cent stake, is taken into account, Pilanis investments could be valued over Rs 2,000 crore.

 Besides Century, Pilani has significant stakes in AV Birla company Hindalco, Grasim, BK Birla flagship Kesoram Industries and the other group outfits like Mangalam Cement, KK Birla company Zuari Industries and SK Birla group entity Mysore Cement.

 The Grasim stock rose by 1.35 per cent, or Rs 16.10, to close at Rs 1,211.50 on the NSE. Pilani has a 4.69 per cent stake in Grasim. The Hindalco stock also moved up by 1.69 per cent, or Rs 22.15, to close at Rs 1,333.70 on the NSE.

 The development augurs well for both Kumar Mangalam Birla-controlled companies, as he would further consolidate his hold over them.

 The move will help B.K. Birla to cement his holding in flagship Kesoram Industries. Pilani holds a 5.28 per cent stake in that company. The stock went up 2.46 per cent, or Rs 3.15, to close at Rs 131.2.

 Zuari Industries, where Pilani has a 1.47 per cent stake, went up by 50 paise at Rs 89.15.

 However, SK Birla outfit Mysore Cement, where Pilani has a 3.16 per cent holding, declined by 35 paise, or 1.5 per cent, to close at Rs 23.05.

 Pilani has no significant holdings in MP Birla firms like Birla Corp, Universal Cables and Vindhya Telelinks.

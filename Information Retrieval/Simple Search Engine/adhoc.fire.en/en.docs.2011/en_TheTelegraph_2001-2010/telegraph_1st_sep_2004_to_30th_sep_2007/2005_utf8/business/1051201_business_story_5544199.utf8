 Calcutta, Nov. 30: The Electronics and Computer Software Export Promotion Council (ESC) is contemplating to set up 11 information technology clusters across the country to provide the small and medium IT entrepreneurs a platform to interact with the government. These centres will also enable the enterprises to avail of various promotional offers to boost exports.

 Says Nalin Kohli, chairman, ESC, The clusters will play an important role in the dialogue between the government and the industry. There are also a number of region-specific issues which the respective centres can handle. The cluster-guided IT roadmap will help us build on our strengths and give a boost to the small and medium enterprise.

 The 11 clusters ? four in the southern region, two in the west, four in the north and one in the east ? together will account for 90 per cent of the total membership in ESC. The council currently has 2300 members.

 ESC is also acting as a driving force to make the country a hardware hub on the lines of the software industry. This requires a quantitative change in the policy framework governing hardware production, exports, foreign direct investment, rationalisation of labour and also functioning of the SEZs, says Kohli. A committee will take up these issues in a systematic and localised manner, he disclosed.

 ESC will also focus on the growing hardware exports which at present stands at $1.8 billion compared to $17.41 billion by the software industry. This year (2005-06), while the software exports is expected to grow by 30-35 per cent, the exports by the hardware industry will grow by merely 5 per cent, taking the combined exports to $24 billion.

 Meet to iron out ore allocation glitches

 Calcutta, Dec. 18: In an effort to prevent states from losing steel projects because of raw material problems, the chief secretaries of mineral-rich states are meeting steel ministry officials on December 21 in New Delhi. The meeting will discuss the issues of mine allotment and inter-state movement of iron ore.

 The chief secretaries of Bengal, Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Goa and Andhra Pradesh will try to formulate a roadmap so that the states can tap the opportunity in the steel industry. Integrated companies like Tata Steel, Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Ispat, Essar and Jindal have announced expansion plans. International giants like Posco and Mittal Steel are also not lagging behind. Smaller companies such as Visa Steel have also lined up ambitious expansion plans. 

 However, very few of the projects have taken off as states are not being able to provide clear mining titles to any company.

 The National Steel Policy, on the other hand, has envisaged production of 100 mt by 2020 from the present level of 40 mt.

 The Centre and states are in a fix over mine allotment as there are long queues and preference to one company will alienate others.

 The steel ministry has set up two committees to look into the issue of allotment of mines and whether mining can be developed as an industry.

 Last week, the ministry had asked leading industry players to give a clear roadmap of their expansion plan till 2012.

 Many believe that companies are in a rush to announce projects and sign MoUs with state governments just to secure mining reserves.

 With a phenomenal rise of iron ore prices in the last one-and-a-half years, steel players across the world have started scrambling for mining leases.

 Realising the long-term benefits of the manufacturing industry, states are also playing hardball on leases.

 Recently, Jharkhand denied lease to the Jindals for their project in Bengal. As a result, it had to shift the unit to Jharkhand. Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee took up the matter with his Jharkhand counterpart Arjun Munda and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh but with no result.

 This is a disturbing trend and can derail the 100-mt production plan by 2020.

 Ranbaxy to launch 15 drugs in US

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Singh: New horizon

 Mumbai, Nov. 18: Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd has lined up a slew of launches for the US market over the next two years. It is planning to introduce 15 new products, valued at $27 billion each, in the US in 2006 and 2007. 

 The move is a part of Ranbaxys strategy to grow aggressively in the key markets, such as the US, as it wants to become one of the top five generic companies by 2012. This was disclosed at an investors meet held by the company here on Thursday.

 Ranbaxys CEO and managing director Brian W. Tempest and president Malvinder M. Singh revealed that the company has made cumulative filings of 158 drugs in the US out of which it has received approvals for 111 so far. The US is the worlds largest pharmaceutical market. 

 Ranbaxy also has 47 filings in the pipeline and of these, 19 could be potential first-to-file (FTF) drugs. 

 If the company comes out victorious in these cases, it will enjoy market exclusivity for some of these drugs for a few months. 

 The total market size of these drugs has been put at $22.6 billion in 2006-07 and Ranbaxy plans to launch seven such products ?Pravastatin 80 mg and Simvastatin 80 mg, both cholesterol drugs, and Modafinil which is used to treat sleep disorder. 

 Pravastatins market size is estimated at $220 million while that of Simvastatin is $494 million. Modafinil is put at $496 million. Ranbaxy hopes to capture a market share of 50 per cent in the case of the first two drugs and around 20 per cent for Modafinil, which will be launched in June.

 Ranbaxy has drawn up this ambitious plan despite being faced with severe price erosions in the US generic market. It is because the company is optimistic about the emerging landscape for generic drugs ? the ageing population and increasing healthcare costs are expected to revive the market for such drugs. Globally, the market for generic drugs is expected to post a compounded annual growth rate of 16 per cent between 2004-08. In the US alone, the growth rate is put at 13 per cent during this period with the market size jumping to $32.5 billion.

 Teva, Sandoz, Merck, Ratiopharm, Watson, Alpharma and Mylan are the worlds leading generic companies. With sales of $1.2 billion in 2005, Ranbaxy is also expected to enter into the top 10 chart. The company now wants to move up this pecking order. Ranbaxy expects that its sales will cross $2 billion mark in 2007 and this will reach $5 billion by the year 2012. A significant income of the company is coming from proprietary products.

 Ranbaxy has forecast an operating margin of 16 per cent on a sales growth of over 18 per cent for the year 2006. Admitting that the price erosion in generics would impact its operating margin, the company said a lower spend in research and development coupled with cost saving initiatives and lower spend in litigation and income from new products would offset the pressure.

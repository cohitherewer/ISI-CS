 Mumbai, Oct. 17: HDFC Bank has reported a 31 per cent rise in its second quarter earnings this fiscal riding on resurgent economic activities and credit growth. The bank clocked a net profit of Rs 199.64 crore for the three-month period ended September 30 against Rs 152.29 crore in the same period last year.

 While these figures were in line with analysts expectations, a big plus in the banks balance sheet has been the significant growth in its core income ? the net interest income during the reporting quarter increased by Rs 186.6 crore to Rs 612.1 crore, a rise of around 44 per cent. 

 According to the bank statement, the rise in the net interest income was stemmed by an average asset growth of 36 per cent and an improvement in the net interest margin to just above 4 per cent from 3.8 per cent in the same quarter last year.

 The banks total assets increased to Rs 36,764 crore on September 30 from Rs 25,467 crore a year ago, a growth of over 44 per cent. Retail loans rose around 74 per cent to Rs 17,453 crore, and now form 52.1 per cent of the banks gross advances. It was 46.7 per cent last year. 

 Bank officials said there has been a good growth on the corporate front as well.

 Net revenues (net interest income and other income) for the quarter was Rs 872.3 crore, an increase of 59.1 per cent over Rs 548.3 crore registered in the corresponding quarter last year. 

 Total income was Rs 1,283.1 crore against Rs 867.4 crore a year ago. 

 While provisions and contingencies for the quarter rose to Rs 180.6 crore (Rs.75.8 crore), HDFC Bank said the total balance sheet size increased by 40.2 per cent to Rs 60,388 crore on September 30. Savings account deposits grew by nearly 47 per cent.

 In the half year ended September 30, the banks total income was Rs 2,440.7 crore. Net profit also rose 31 per cent to Rs 383.2 crore.

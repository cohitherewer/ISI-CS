 Singhania: Dress it up

 Mumbai, Feb. 17: Textiles major Raymond Ltd has chalked out a Rs 280-crore investment plan. The company will spend Rs 180 crore to set up a cotton fabric unit in collaboration with Cotonificio Honegger, part of Italy?s Gruppo Zambaiti.

 It will also set up a new worsted suiting facility with a capacity of 3 million metres and a capital outlay of Rs 100 crore. The unit will take the company?s capacity to 27 million metres and also strengthen its position as the leader in the worsted suiting segment globally. 

 Both units are expected to go on stream by March next year and will together add Rs 300 crore to the Raymond?s topline. 

 These initiatives are part of the companys plan to emerge as a one-stop shop offering total textile solutions, said chairman and managing director Gautam Singhania. 

 Raymond, he added, is now in a position to give complete solutions in suiting, shirting or jeans.

 Drawing a comparison with China, which dishes out large volumes, he said, India?s strength will be high-quality and low-volume products. ?Both India and China will be suppliers to the world, but catering to different niche segments,? he added.

 Gruppo Zambaiti is among the top three Italian high fashion cotton textile groups, with strengths in design. It supplies to leading premium shirt brands worldwide. 

 The capacity of the fabric plant will be 10.5 million metres. The unit will help the company expand its product portfolio by entering into cotton fabrics. 

 This facility will cater to the international markets at the higher end and the company?s own requirements of fine shirt fabrics for its premium brands, including Manzoni, Park Avenue and ColorPlus. Apart from countries in Europe and the US, the Italian partner is also likely to purchase a part of the shirting production.

 In the post-quota regime, textile majors from developed nations have been moving their capacities to low-cost countries like India. 

 On the other hand, partnering with overseas majors is expected to help Raymond strengthen its presence in the international market.

 According to Pradeep Bhandari, who was today redesignated as whole-time director and group president, the project is likely to be funded in a debt equity ratio of 1.5:1.

 FM seeks Left support on pension bill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 22: Finance Minister P Chidambaram today asked the leaders of the Left parties to reconsider opposition to his pension bill to put in place a ?legal basis? for the new scheme started last year.

 ?I requested the Left parties to reconsider their opposition to the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill,? he told journalists. The bill will be taken up for debate in the Lok Sabha. 

 ?I have pointed out that the new pension system has already come into force from January 2004. It is now without a legal basis. It is, therefore, important to provide one,? he added. 

 Though the bill enables setting up a body to regulate the new pension scheme, which the government brought in last year, it also grants powers to the regulator to control all pension plans that will be launched. Therefore, it opens up the possibility of opening up the pension sector up to private players in the future ? something that the Left objects to.

 It could also take away from law-makers the right to thrash out controversial issues such as foreign investment levels in future pension funds, whether the proceeds from pension funds will be invested at home or abroad and the proportion of the amount parked in the stock market and gilts.

 The finance minister said he has already spoken to the Left leaders on the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill, which will enable the government to set up a regulator and allow private players to manage long-term savings.

 Currently, the pension contribution of the new government employees is being accumulated in the consolidated accounts of the government. 

 Once the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority Bill is passed and the pension regulator gives licence to fund managers, the contribution would be managed by them. 

 ?I am sure they will consider my request. Let us see what happens in the floor of the House,? Chidambaram said. 

 It is unlikely that the Left will agree to do the finance minister?s bidding but luckily for the government, the BJP, which had first worked on this bill, is likely to support it despite raising questions initially.

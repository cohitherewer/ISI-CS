 Raw jute price to be fixed soon

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Calcutta, Dec. 6: The Union textile ministry is likely to fix the maximum price for the representative grade raw jute ? TD-4 ? at around Rs 1432 per quintal this week. Maximum tradeable prices for other grades will also be fixed proportionately, sources said.

 The government is also planning to enforce the Essential Commodities Act and conduct a de-hoarding drive in jute growing areas and warehouses of traders and dealers.

 The price of raw jute today reached its peak with the TD-4 grade quoting around Rs 1,530 per quintal. The move to fix the maximum price for raw jute comes in the wake of lukewarm response from dealers who were asked to register themselves with the city-based office of the jute commissioner.

 Jute commissioner S. Majumdar has written to the chief secretary and the home secretary, seeking the help of food and civil supplies department, enforcement department of the state police and respective district administrations in conducting the de-hoarding drive.

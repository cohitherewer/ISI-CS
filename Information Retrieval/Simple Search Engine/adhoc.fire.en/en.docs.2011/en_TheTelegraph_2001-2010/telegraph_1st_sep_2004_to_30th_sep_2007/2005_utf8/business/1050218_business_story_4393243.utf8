The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 HPL tests Basell deal

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, Feb. 17: Haldia Petrochemicals (HPL) will complete due diligence on Basell Polyolefins in two days, after which it will place a proposal to invest in the Dutch petrochemicals company before its board of directors.

 A team headed by HPL chief executive Swapan Bhowmik is in Amsterdam to size up the business of Basell. ?We are trying to find out what value Basell will add to HPL if we invest in it. We have to place a formal proposal before the board and get its approval,? Bhowmik told The Telegraph from Amsterdam.

 Picking up a stake in Basell will require clearance from the Bengal government, one of the principal promoters of HPL. 

 Purnendu Chatterjee of The Chatterjee Group, which holds a large stake in HPL, teamed up with ICICI ventures and clutch of US investors to table a bid for Basell. 

 Chatterjee wants Haldia Petrochem to join the consortium. HPL, on its part, has already told lenders it is considering a stake in Basell.

 April shutdown

 Haldia Petrochem plans a full shutdown at its naphtha cracker in the first half of April. The 520,000-tonne-per-year unit will undergo two weeks of maintenance and some minor debottlenecking during the production halt. ?We want to make the unit more efficient and produce more high-value molecules. We planned the closure three to four months ago. Consumers were informed about it. We have built up a stock for those who want our products during the shutdown,? Bhowmik added. 

 Crackers process naphtha into ethylene and propylene, the basic building blocks for the chemical sector. Senior officials of HPL said naphtha imports in April could come down as a result of the temporary production hold-up.

 Haldia buys 300,000 tonnes of naphtha from Kuwait Petroleum each year under a term contract. It meets the rest of its needs from the spot market.

 New Delhi, Oct. 14: Tata Motors today hinted at raising the prices of its vehicles due to continued pressure on margins. Maruti, Hyundai and Honda have already increased prices in the last one month. 

 You should not be surprised to see carmakers increase prices. Input and freight costs have gone up significantly, said Rajiv Dube, senior vice-president, Tata Motors, while launching the turbo- charged version of the popular hatchback car ? Indica.

 Asked when the prices will be increased, he said, We wont do anything as a consequence of what others do. We will announce it at an appropriate time.

 The turbo-charged diesel variants of Indica will be priced at Rs 4.1 lakh (DLG) and Rs 4.3 lakh (DLX), ex-showroom Delhi. It will be available in three colours ? cherry red, oasis green and arctic silver.

 Indica V2 Turbo is the second vehicle from the Tata stable in the last three months. It had rolled out Safari Dicor, a sports-utility vehicle powered by the common direct rail injection technology, in August. 

 The new Indica, already available in the European markets, will set a benchmark for diesel hatchback cars in driving performance compared with petrol cars, sources said.

 Tata Motorss passenger vehicle sales, including cars, dropped 2 per cent in the first half of this fiscal to 84,141 units from 85,948 in the same period last fiscal.

 Dube said the company would be able to cover this loss in the second half.

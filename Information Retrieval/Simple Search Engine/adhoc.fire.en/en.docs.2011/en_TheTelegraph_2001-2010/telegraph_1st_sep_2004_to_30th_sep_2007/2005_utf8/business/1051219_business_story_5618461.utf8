The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Crisil set to deepen ties with parent

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Ravimohan: Aiming big

 Calcutta, Dec. 18: Crisil Limited, along with its majority stakeholder, Standard amp; Poor?s (S amp;P), is exploring opportunities to set up rating agencies across the globe. It is also looking at options to introduce some of S amp;P?s products in India.

 ?We are getting a number of inquiries from companies keen on setting up rating agencies in various parts of the world. Such opportunities exist in the Asian, African and eastern European countries,? Crisil managing director and chief executive officer R. Ravimohan told The Telegraph. 

 ?The decision to set up such agencies is fuelled by the development in local financial markets and absence of rating agencies. Rating is an important element of capital market development,? said Ravimaohan. Crisil currently holds a 10 per cent equity in Cary Cris, a rating agency formed by 20 Caribbean countries.

 ?The opportunities are being explored in collaboration with S amp;P and the decision to use the S amp;P or Crisil brand or even a joint brand will depend on various factors. However, the brand which is used will be paid accordingly,? he said.

 Crisil, which has introduced SME ratings and corporate training this year, has not yet launched any S amp;P product in the country. ?We are studying the options of launching S amp;P products in the country based on various factors, including pricing points,? said Ravimohan.

 The products under consideration include options on the equity front due to a vibrant stock market and portfolio advisory services because of wider private banking and mutual fund reach, he said. 

 ?We are also keen on introducing more advanced and complex finance products such as commercial mortgages and refinance of mortgage-backed securities,? added Ravimohan.

 ?We have diversified our portfolio from a strictly rating-based company to include research and information and advisory services. Now, our primary objective is to consolidate our position in these areas,? he said. Currently, rating contributes around 45 per cent of the revenues of the company, while research and information and advisory services contribute roughly another 30 and 25 per cent respectively.

 Crisil and S amp;P are also exploring a change of name for Crisil. ?Both S amp;P and Crisil are strong brands and we are trying to achieve the maximum leverage from the two brands,? he said.

 For the first six months of this fiscal, Crisil achieved a growth rate of almost 200 per cent, mostly fuelled by the acquisitions of London-based gas advisory and information firm, EconoMatters Ltd and Irevna.

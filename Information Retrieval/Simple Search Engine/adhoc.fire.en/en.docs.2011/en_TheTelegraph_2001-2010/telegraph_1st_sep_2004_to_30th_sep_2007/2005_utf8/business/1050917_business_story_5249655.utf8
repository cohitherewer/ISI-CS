 Clarity call on tariff plans

 New Delhi, Sept. 16: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today directed service providers not to announce misleading tariff plans.

 Banners on streets and advertisements in the media with titles like ?zero rentals? and ?no activation charge? have been termed as misleading if a charge is later levied without explicitly mentioning the service.

 To restrict such a practice, the regulator has mandated that service providers should show all monthly recurring charges under one sub-head for transparency.

 Trai has directed that no tariff plan will be offered, presented, marketed or advertised in a manner that is likely to mislead subscribers. For example, the title of a tariff plan which suggests absence of rental would be misleading if the plan has monthly mandatory fixed charge in one form or other.

 It also wants all monthly recurring charges, which are compulsory for a subscriber under any given plan, to be shown under one head.

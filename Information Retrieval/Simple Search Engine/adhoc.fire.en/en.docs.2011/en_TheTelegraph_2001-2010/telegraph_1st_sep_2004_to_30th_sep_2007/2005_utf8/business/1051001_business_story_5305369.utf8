The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Bird wants to fly on ally?s wings

 Wong: Tough act

 New Delhi, Sept. 30: Nokia and Motorola may be quietly mulling their options, but a Chinese mobile handset maker is preparing to hang up on its plans to establish a fully-owned handset manufacturing unit in India.

 Bird, one of the largest mobile handset makers in China, is now looking at the possibility of roping in an Indian partner with expertise in making consumer electronic items.

 It has begun preliminary talks with Videocon and a few other companies in Bengal and Tamil Nadu that are planning to enter the field of mobile handset manufacture.

 Meanwhile, Bird will continue to import the phones from its factory at Ningbo, near Shanghai to meet the demands of the Indian market.

 ?The government has to make its policies clear and provide a single-window clearance. We find that doing business in India is more difficult, particularly when it comes to setting up units,? said K.P. Wong, head, international business, Ningbo Bird Company.

 ?Many clearances are required from various departments and, worse, one department is not aware of what the other has cleared,? he added.

 Chinese companies in the telecom space have turned a little wary after the trouble that telecom equipment maker Huawei has run into recently. The intelligence agencies advising the government not to clear Huawei?s proposal to expand operations at it Bangalore facility on the specious ground that it could compromise the country?s security.

 Bird, however, has been luckier: it secured a clearance in eight months to set up its liaison office in the country. Other Chinese companies have had to wait for up to two years. 

 Currently, Bird is operating from its India office to have greater operational efficiencies and be closer to the market. This office is responsible for all brand development, strategic alliances and market and business development in the Saarc region.

 Asked about the possibility of combining the hardware strengths of Chinese companies with India?s software prowess, Wong said, ?We are very bullish about such an opportunity.?

 Philip Lee, MD (SAARC region) of Ningbo Bird Company, said, ?We will soon launch mobile phones with Hindi language interface and later add more languages. For this, we are in an advanced stage of negotiations with a few leading software companies.?

 Industry sources confirmed that Bird had recently held talks with Infosys and Wipro to undertake a few software-related projects for their mobile phones, including language interface.

 Lee refused to divulge details about the talks with the software companies.

 Calcutta, Sept. 12: Uco Bank has targeted a 28.5 per cent growth in business at Rs 1 lakh crore in the current fiscal against Rs 77,800 crore in the previous financial year.

 We expect to achieve a growth of Rs 9,400 crore in advances and Rs 13,600 crore in deposits, chairman and managing director V. Sridar said. During 2004-05, the bank had deposits worth Rs 49,200 crore and made advances of Rs 27,800 crore.

 The bank is opening a representative office at Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia on October 3, said Sridar. It has also sought permission from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to open representative offices in Bangladesh, Dubai and China. Last fiscal, the bank grossed business worth Rs 5,000 crore from its overseas operations, he added.

 Uco Bank has tied up with Prudential ICICI Mutual Fund to distribute its mutual fund schemes. 

 It also has similar tie-ups with UTI Asset Management and Reliance Capital. The bank foresees a turnover of around Rs 500 crore from mutual fund distribution, said Sridar.

 We expect our fee-based income to be Rs 50 crore for the current fiscal, he said. Apart from mutual funds, the bank has a tie-up with the Life Insurance Corporation of India for distributing life insurance policies. 

 It also sells non-life products of National Insurance Company.

 According to the agreement with Prudential ICICI, the bank will distribute the entire range of 22 mutual fund schemes to its over 9 million customers across 1,800 branches.

 Prudential ICICI Asset Management is contemplating a mutual fund scheme based on outsourcing and the immense opportunity provided by it to the Indian economy.

 Outsourcing is not just restricted to the IT sector, it has now reached beyond and is prevalent in automobile, pharmaceutical and various other sectors, Prudential ICICI Mutual Fund managing director Pankaj Razdan said.

 The fund house, which recently closed its infrastructure fund, is the largest private sector mutual fund in the country with assets under management of Rs 21,477 crore as on August 31. We became the first private mutual fund to cross Rs 20,000-crore assets under management and we achieved this through a growth of over Rs 3,500 crore last month, he added.

 Calcutta, Dec. 9: Germanys Intent Software has entered India with its online game, Astonia, which will be distributed through an exclusive tie-up with Calcutta-based Descon Limited.

 The distribution will start in the eastern region from next month, but will later be extended to other metros and towns in a phased manner.

 India is a potential market for online gaming and we want to be one of the early ones to tap it. Also, with the entry of low-cost computers, there will be a significant rise in PC and Internet penetration and online gaming in India, Intent Software managing director Alexander von der Geest said.

 Descon managing director S. Radhakrishnan said the company is in talks to identify distributors across the country. Branded cyber caf? chains will also play an important role in popularising online gaming.

 Users can buy prepaid cards of different denominations ranging from Rs 45 to Rs 450 for 12 hours to one month, respectively, and use them to play the game.

 Globally, online gaming is a $9-billion market, but is expected to touch $31.4 billion by 2008.

 According to industry sources, Indian players could become a dominant force in the global online gaming market due to the large developmental activities taking place in the country.

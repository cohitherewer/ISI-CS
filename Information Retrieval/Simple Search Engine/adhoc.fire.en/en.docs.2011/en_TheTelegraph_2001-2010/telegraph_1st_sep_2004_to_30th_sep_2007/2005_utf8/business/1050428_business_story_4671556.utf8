The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Eveready lists after makeover

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, April 27: The shares of Eveready Industries India Limited ? the newly formed company after the Khaitans demerged the tea and battery businesses ? was listed at Rs 75 today on the bourses.

 The shares, with a face value of Rs 5, touched a high of Rs 98.40 before closing at Rs 84 on the National Stock Exchange.

 Market analysts said fund managers have picked up quite a handful of Eveready Industries shares. They said the restructuring of the company has resulted in lowering the interest outgo and improved the financials of the company. ?This has attracted the investors,? they said.

 Managing director and executive vice-chairman Deepak Khaitan had recently been in Hong Kong and Singapore to inform fund managers about the newly formed Eveready Industries.

 Nearly 8.19 lakh shares of the company were traded on NSE. Before the demerger, Eveready shares were traded between Rs 42 and Rs 45.

 Khaitan told The Telegraph that a good performance by the company has created a lot of enthusiasm among investors.

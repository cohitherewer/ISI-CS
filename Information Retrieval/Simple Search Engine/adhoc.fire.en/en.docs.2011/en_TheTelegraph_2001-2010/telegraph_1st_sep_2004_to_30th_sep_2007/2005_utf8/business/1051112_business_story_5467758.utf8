 Bharti ties rate cut to ADC abolition

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Nov. 11: The Bharti Group has voiced its discontent over the telecom ministry?s move to lower the entry fee for new operators in the national and international long-distance services. 

 Within 24 hours of chief Sunil Mittal applauding the initiative taken by communications minister Dayanidhi Maran to bring down STD/ISD tariffs, the company said it would not reduce STD tariffs unless the access deficit (ADC) charge was scrapped.

 The ADC is collected from private players to compensate those operators who offer telecom services in rural and inaccessible areas at a higher infrastructure cost.

 Maran has said in the past that the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India should address the ADC issue. His ministry has approached the regulator.

 The communications ministry had, on Thursday, announced a reduction in entry fee for STD and ISD services to Rs 2.5 crore and hoped that this would bring down tariffs.

 One of the Bharti?s top guns, however, ruled out any cut in the STD tariff, unless there is a reduction in the ADC along with a shift to revenue sharing. 

 ?No there would not be any cut in the NLD tariff,? said Akhil Gupta, joint managing director and chief financial officer of Bharti. 

 He also clarified that there has been no significant impact, which allows operators to pass on the benefit to consumers. ?We get a carriage charge of less than 50 paise. The proposed cut saves us only about 9 per cent on costs. In terms of benefiting the customer, it will be a very small amount.? 

 Bharti will also take up the issue of lowering the entry fee for new players with the government and demand a compensation.

 Senior executives in the regulatory team at Bharti Infotel said, ?We have already stated in our previous meetings with the government that any cut would be against the spirit of the licence and an unnecessary burden on existing operators. Again, it will be highlighted to the minister and senior officials in the DoT. Our senior executives have already sought an appointment with the minister.?

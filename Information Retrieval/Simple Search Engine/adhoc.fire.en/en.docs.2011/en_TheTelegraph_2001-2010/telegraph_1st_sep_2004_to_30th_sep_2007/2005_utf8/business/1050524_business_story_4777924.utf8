 Building blocks for jobs

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 23: The Rs 1,74,000-crore Bharat Nirman Yojana is expected to create nearly 4 million jobs by 2015, says India Inc. 

 This will lead to a rise in the demand for dwelling units to 80 million for lower-middle and low-income groups, involving an estimated investment of $670 billion. Estimates reveal that when Indias GDP will record a growth of over 10 per cent, real-estate and housing will grow at 14 per cent per annum. At present, these sectors contribute less than 1 per cent.

 According to official estimates, the Indian housing sector faces a shortage of 20 million dwelling units for the lower-middle and low-income groups. This segment is expected to witness a spurt of about 22.5 million dwelling units by the end of the Tenth Plan period.

 Real estate is considered to be one of the major engines propelling national growth and it is valued at $14-15 billion. 

 Housing and real-estate sector is the second largest employer in the country, next only to agriculture and textiles. Easy financing and growth of multinationals and Indian firms in IT, ITeS, BPO and FMCG sectors will fuel the demand for housing in the next 10 to 15 years.

 Industry wants the government to give infrastructure status to the housing industry to enable it to have easy access to low-cost institutional funds as well as allow it to tap long-term funds. Setting up of real-estate mutual funds should be encouraged for the housing sector with certain tax incentives. In most developing economies, the system is in vogue and there is no harm if India follows it, said Assocham, which carried out a study on the subject.

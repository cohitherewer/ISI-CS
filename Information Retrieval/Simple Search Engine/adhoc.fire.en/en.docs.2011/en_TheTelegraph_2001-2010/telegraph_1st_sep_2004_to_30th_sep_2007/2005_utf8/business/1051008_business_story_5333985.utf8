 Also, the exercise will spur growth and generate more earnings and benefit all the stakeholders. Our accelerated thrust on branding will drive our business strategy. The revenue after the merger of our brands will be over Rs 1300 crore, making us one of the top players in the domestic FMCG industry, he added.

 Re-rolling mills face reality

 Calcutta, July 20: The Centre has asked secondary steel producers to be self-sufficient and stop clamouring for government interventions.

 In a globalised environment, the industry should not expect the government to step in and tackle issues which they must sort out themselves, steel ministry joint secretary J.P. Singh said at the annual general meeting of the Re-Rolling Mills Association of India.

 Singh suggested that the secondary producers should look at alternative markets for survival.

 Pointing out that the industry was at a cross-roads, he said re-rollers should now look at niche products that were not serviced by the integrated primary steel players.

 The industry should look at alloy steel products where value realisation is higher. The export market should also be explored, he said.

 Responding to a query by association chairman S. S. Beriwala on raw material crises, the secretary said primary steel producers would bring down semis production in 3 to 4 years and move towards value-added products. The re-rollers will have to make alternative arrangements keeping that in mind.

 Re-rollers using billets as feedstock enjoy a certain locational advantage over primary steel producers like Steel Authority of India (SAIL) and Tata Steel.

 Being closer to the market, their products are cheaper than that of primary players. However, with the development of infrastructure, this advantage is short-lived and they will have to compete with big boys.

 Singh said the re-rolling mills should invest on quality to survive the changing scenario. 

 A consolidation in the industry was unavoidable and the days of protectionism were over, he said.

 The government has assured assistance for modernising the units. Under a UNDP programme, 30 model units will be set up in three phases.

 Singh urged the industry to learn from the experience of these units.

 Regarding the availability of power, Singh suggested taking advantage of the new policy to set up plants. 

 Some associations are setting up own captive plants to secure cheap and uninterrupted power. Others should also follow that, he said.

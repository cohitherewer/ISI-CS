 Mumbai, Nov. 29: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries is close to sealing a bid for the assets of Able Laboratories Inc. 

 The acquisition deal, Suns second major in the US, is understood to be over $23 million. 

 Sun Pharma has pipped the Hyderabad-based Aurobindo Pharma which had also expressed an interest in the Ables assets.

 In a submission with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Able stated that it has entered into an asset purchase agreement with Sun Pharma on November 1. 

 On November 1, Able Laboratories held an auction for the sale of nearly all of its assets, free and clear of liens. At the conclusion of the auction, the company (Able) entered into an asset purchase agreement with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, Able informed the SEC. According to the agreement, the closure of the deal is subject to ratification and approval by the bankruptcy court and environmental approvals. 

 Able Laboratories manufactures generic pharmaceutical products in tablet, capsule and liquid dosage forms. In May this year, the company had suspended the manufacturing and distribution of its entire product line due to which the company is currently not generating any income. 

 Subsequently, it had filed a petition for restructuring under Chaper 11 of the US Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court of New Jersey district on July 18.

 On October 19, Able had announced that it had signed a non-bonding letter of intent with Aurobindo Pharma for the sale of its assets. While the deal with Aurobindo Pharma was conditional upon completion of satisfactory due diligence, Able subsequently informed that it held an auction of its assets on November 1 to solicit higher and better bids than the one with Aurobindo Pharma. 

 However, when contacted, Sun Pharma officials said that it was still too early to comment on whether the pact with Able has been sealed. It has not yet been closed, is all what they could say.

 If Sun Pharma becomes successful in closing the deal, it will be its second major acquisition in the US. The company, headed by Dilip Shanghvi, has been highly successful in turning around the ailing specialty pharmaceutical company, Caraco.

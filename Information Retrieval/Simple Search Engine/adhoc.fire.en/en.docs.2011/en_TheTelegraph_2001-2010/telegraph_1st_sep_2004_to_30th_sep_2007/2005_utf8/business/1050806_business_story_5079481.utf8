 Mumbai, Aug. 5: The Bank of Baroda (BoB) is looking at Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Singapore and Sri Lanka to expand its global branch network. The bank is already present in 19 countries.

 BoB has opened its eighth branch at Leicester in the UK, taking its total number of overseas branches to 39. BoB said apart from Sri Lanka, it would consider opening branches in Trinidad amp; Tobago, Canada and New Zealand in the near future. One more office at Bangkok has also started operations.

 BoB, which has more than 2,700 branches in India, has 58 overseas offices, comprising 39 branches, two representative offices and 17 branches of seven international subsidiaries. It also has one joint venture in Zambia.

 The bank will disburse personal and business loans in Leicester. 

 It will also offer normal banking products and services. The Leicester clients will have access to the Net and tele-banking facilities apart from debit and credit cards, operations of which have already been introduced in the UK by BoB.

 BoBs plan to expand its presence abroad is in keeping with the trend in the domestic banking sector. While the State Bank of India (SBI) and Bank of India (BoI) are in the process of beefing up their presence, ICICI Bank is closing in on an acquisition.

 The banks are increasing their presence abroad to cater to NRIs and domestic companies with overseas acquisitions.

 BoB has launched a technology-enabled business transformation project to provide its domestic and international customers seamless services. The project includes core banking for 1,919 domestic branches and some of its international ones.

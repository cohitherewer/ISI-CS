 New Delhi, June 17: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today directed various ministries to work towards removing infrastructure bottlenecks and liberalising labour laws in order to boost the growth of industry and international trade.

 Kumar Mangalam Birla, chairman of the newly-constituted board of trade, told reporters after the first meeting with Singh that ?we placed before the Prime Minister both industry-specific issues and general issues that are of concern to trade and industry. We had a good discussion with the Prime Minister and the commerce minister.? 

 ?We have suggested that infrastructure bottlenecks and rigid labour laws should be addressed,? Birla added.

 ?The Prime Minister has asked the ministries concerned to work on the ideas suggested by the board of trade to address constraints faced by trade and industry,? commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath said after the meeting.

 Birla said the board at its meeting today called for changing the mindset, ensuring faster growth in the manufacturing sector and strengthening the ?Made in India? brand in global markets.

 Nath said the board, an advisory body of the commerce ministry, would evolve a strategy to synergise India with the global economy and help the country emerge as a prominent global economic player.

 This will enable the country to achieve a trade figure of $500 billion in the next four years from the $185 billion at present. The board is expected to draw up a strategy to achieve this target. The thrust would be on increasing agricultural, marine and leather exports, he said. 

 ?While the government is there to provide vision and the bureaucracy is in place for implementation, the board of trade will have to fill the vacuum of providing the strategies for short, medium and long-term growth in international trade,? Nath told the board members.

 The minister said exports had grown 19 per cent during April-May this year. ?However, we must grow further and faster,? he added. 

 Apart from increasing exports, Nath said imports also must go up to fuel industrial activity. ?There is nothing wrong with importing even consumer goods since consumers deserve to have a choice,? the minister observed. 

 He emphasised the importance of reducing transaction costs in order to make Indian exports more competitive. He suggested that the board of trade could hold a special meeting to discuss ways on cutting transaction costs.

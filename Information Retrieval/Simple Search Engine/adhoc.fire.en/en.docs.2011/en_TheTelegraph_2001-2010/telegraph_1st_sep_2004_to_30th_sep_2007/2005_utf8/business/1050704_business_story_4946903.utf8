 Q amp;A

 Charity counts

 I am a senior citizen. During the financial year ended March 31, 2005, I donated Rs 12,000 to Ramakrishna Sarada Mission, which, as mentioned in the receipts issued by them, is exempted from income tax. Can I claim the exemption? Also, can I claim any exemption of income tax on interest from government bonds during the current financial year?

 S. K. Sen, Calcutta 

 Yes, you can claim exemption for the donated amount under section 80G. The section for claiming exemption on interest on government bonds under section 80L has been scrapped from the current financial year.

 Short fuse

 Is mutual fund investment below Rs 50,000 , if redeemed within a period of one year, taxable?

 Guru Prasanna Chandra, Orissa

 y investment in a mutual fund, irrespective of the amount, if redeemed within one year, is subject to short-term capital gains tax.

 Regular investment

 I want to invest in systematic investment plans of equity funds. Please suggest the ideal procedure of investment in such schemes, especially the period of investment.

 Arun Pal, Calcutta

 Systematic investment plans are generally offered for a minimum period of six months and a minimum amount of Rs 500. However, the minimum investment may be subject to some limits, which is often Rs 5,000. Nevertheless, an investor might continue the investment for longer duration, based on the investment objective and horizon.

 Away from home

 I am an NRI and have taken a home loan from a private sector Indian bank. Can I claim the applicable tax benefits?

 S. Rathore, by e-mail

 NRIs cannot claim tax benefits on home loans. However, if you pay tax in India for any income earned within the country, you can claim tax rebate on the home loan.

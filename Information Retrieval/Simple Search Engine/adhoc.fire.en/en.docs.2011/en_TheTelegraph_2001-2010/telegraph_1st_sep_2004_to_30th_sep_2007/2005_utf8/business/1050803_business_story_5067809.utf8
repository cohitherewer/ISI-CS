 FM channel plays deficit cut tune

 Chidambaram: Almost there

 New Delhi, Aug. 2: The government is optimistic about lowering the fiscal deficit as it feels that the economy had shown considerable resilience despite fears of volatile oil prices.

 The optimism was expressed in the quarterly review of the economy that was tabled today in Parliament by finance minister P. Chidambaram. The minister said fiscal deficit could be cut given better expenditure management, revenue collections and resilient economic growth despite the high and volatile international crude prices.

 However, the government report, based on an expected boom in industrial output, states that the economy will be able to factor in the oil price spiral and grow at the earlier predicted rates. 

 According to North Block economists, spurt in crude prices and Mumbai floods would not impact the growth projection of 7 per cent... the marginal shave-off induced by these incidents will be more than made up by the huge growth impetus.

 Chidambaram is, however, a little more cautious. While concerns arising out of high and volatile international crude prices remain, the economy demonstrates considerable resilience and the governments efforts at fiscal consolidation through improved tax administration and expenditure control are continuing, he said.

 The Centres revenue deficit is budgeted at 2.7 per cent of GDP and fiscal deficit at 4.3 per cent for 2005-06, which is same as the previous year. Analysts have been urging the government to reduce the deficit rate as they feel that it is too high. The government, through a fiscal responsibility bill, has committed to reduce the deficit to zero in another three years. 

 In his budget speech, however, Chidambaram had asked Parliament to allow him to press the pause button on commitments to reduce deficit this year, given the high expenditure on social causes like education and health.

 The Centre had closed the last financial year with a lower fiscal deficit of 4.1 per cent against an earlier estimate of 4.5 per cent. Revenue deficit was also pruned to 2.6 per cent from an estimated target of 2.7 per cent.

 Although no fiscal correction has been contemplated in the budget for 2005-06 ... yet, encouraged by the actual fiscal performance in 2004-05 in the face of various odds, the government intends to continue with its efforts to reduce the revenue deficit and effect a change in the quality of public expenditure, Chidambaram said.

 The report said the Centres finances were under stress as duties on many goods had been cut last year to lower inflationary pressures and reduce expenditure on some heads. The government would continue to improve fiscal performance, it added.

 According to the finance ministry, tax revenues grew 25.94 per cent at Rs 52,283 crore during the first quarter of this fiscal due to a robust growth in corporation tax and customs duty collections.

 However, income tax collection declined by 21.66 per cent to Rs 8,211 crore in the April-June period against Rs 10,482 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.

 Corporation tax grew 182.20 per cent at Rs 11,147 crore against Rs 3,950 crore in the first quarter of 2004-05. 

 Customs duty collection rose 38.57 per cent to touch Rs 14,788 crore during the first quarter against Rs 10,672 crore in the year-ago period. Collection of excise duties also increased marginally by 4.03 per cent at Rs 14,264 crore against Rs 13,711 crore last year.

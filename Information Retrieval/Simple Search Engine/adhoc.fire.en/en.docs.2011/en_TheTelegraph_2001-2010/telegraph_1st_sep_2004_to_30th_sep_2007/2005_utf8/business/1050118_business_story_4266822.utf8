 FM signals petro duty rejig

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Jan. 17: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said duties will be restructured to make oil companies more efficient and to bring down fuel costs.

 The finance minister said it is a paradox that there are both taxes and subsidies on petroleum products. Addressing Petrotech 2005, Chidambaram underlined the need for fuel-neutral taxes and transparent subsidies.

 The petroleum ministry has been insisting that the government should not impose any duties on subsidised petro-goods such as LPG and kerosene, on which oil companies are losing money.

 ?Taxes and subsidies in the sector are in conflict with each other,? he said, adding any departure from fuel-neutral taxes and transparent subsidies should be avoided.

 The ministry is considering restructuring of petroleum duties, Chidambaram said. He was referring to the Lahiri Committee looking into the issue. The ministry will take up the recommendations with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, he said.

 ?The oil and gas sector would be further opened to competition, including the retail segment. The segment requires greater consolidation given the technological challenges that it faces,? Chidambram added. 

 He asked oil companies to improve efficiency so as to reduce petroleum imports and bring down fuel prices.

 ?We must put in place an extensive programme to reduce oil imports. We must invest in technology,? Chidambaram said, adding this can only happen when both private and public sector companies compete with each other.

 He said India and the developing countries should learn a lesson from Japan, which converted the oil crisis in 1970s into an opportunity by reducing oil imports. Last year, India faced oil shocks but managed to ride the storm because of resilience in the economy, he added.

 ?People realised that inflation was imported. Oil prices now appear to have moderated. But they are inflationary,? he said referring to the inflation rate, which touched over 8.5 per cent in August end last year due to a surge in fuel and metal prices.

 Asked about the volatility of oil prices, he said, ?Oil prices go down and up. They are deceptive. We are not in a region to sit back comfortably.?

 Supporting the finance minister?s views, ONGC chairman Subir Raha said restructuring in the sector is essential but modalities have to be worked out.

 Although the petroleum ministry and Planning Commission are looking at various options of consolidation, he said the ?merger of oil PSUs is one of the options but not the only one?.

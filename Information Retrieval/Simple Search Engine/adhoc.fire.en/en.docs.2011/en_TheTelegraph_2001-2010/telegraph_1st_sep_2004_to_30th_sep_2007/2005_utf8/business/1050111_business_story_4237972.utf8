 Calcutta, Jan. 10: Kotak Mutual Fund has lined up six schemes for its initial public offer (IPO), besides the recently-launched Kotak Mid-Cap Fund, and has filed a draft prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).

 The fund house will launch two fund-of-funds (FoF), one equity-linked savings scheme and two index funds, according to the Sebi website. Kotak has also filed for a contra fund, which it plans to launch within a couple of months.

 The company has recently launched Kotak Mid-Cap fund, whose IPO will close on January 28.

 Chief executive officer Ajay Bagga said, ?We are continuing our three-fold strategy of product innovation, geographical expansion and retail thrust for expansion.?

 Bagga said the mid-cap fund will invest in companies selected through a bottom-up process, where each will be evaluated individually and not on the basis of the sector to which it belongs.

 At present, the fund house has 15 schemes in its portfolio with the mid-cap being the sixteenth. On January 9, the assets under management of the fund stood at Rs 5,490 crore.

 The contra fund will invest in stocks and sectors, which are currently not in favour because of extraordinary circumstances but have the potential to emerge as winners in the future.

 According to the draft prospectus, Kotak Dynamic FoF - Flexi Cap Scheme can invest up to 100 per cent of its assets in large-cap equity and 60 per cent in diversified aggressive equity plans. It also has the option to invest up to 100 per cent in money market schemes at any time, depending on the fund manager?s judgement.

 The Kotak Dynamic FoF - Large Cap Fund will invest 100 per cent of its assets in large-cap equity schemes. It also has the option of switching 100 per cent into liquid funds. Both the fund of funds will be benchmarked against the Crisil Balanced Fund Index.

 Uniply public offer from June 9

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 3: Uniply Industries will tap the primary market to finance its Rs 12-crore expansion plan.

 The company shall offer 50 lakh equity shares of Rs 10 each at a premium of Rs 14 per share. The issue opens on June 9 and closes on June 16.

 The issue proceeds shall be utilised to double the existing production capacity, said B. L. Bengani, managing director, Uniply Industries Limited. The company currently produces 25,000 cubic metres of veneers and plywood per annum.

 The expansion project will include additional plant and machinery, construction of RCC log ponds, factory shed and buildings in the factory premises.

 The additional plant and machinery will help us in producing more and reach out to the north and east India. It will also help us increasing our exports, he explained.

 We export regularly to countries like the UK, Sri Lanka and Singapore. Exports contributed 45 per cent of our total turnover of Rs 28.67 for 2004-05, Bengani added.

 The company will also instal four 225-KW wind electricity generators at Coimbatore, added Bengani.

 Installation of wind electricity generators will help us reduce our current power cost of Rs 1 crore by almost 80-85 per cent, he said.

 The company currently buys power from the Tamil Nadu State Electricity Board at Rs 5.65 per unit. Once we commence our own electricity production, we shall sell power to the board and get it from them at 60-66 paise per unit, explained Bengani.

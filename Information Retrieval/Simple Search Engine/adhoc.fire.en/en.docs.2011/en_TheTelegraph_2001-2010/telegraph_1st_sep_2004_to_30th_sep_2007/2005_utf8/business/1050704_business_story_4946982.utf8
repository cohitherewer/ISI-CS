 Badge of privilege for Haldia

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Hub hopes

 Calcutta, July 3: The ministries of petroleum and chemicals have cleared a plan to turn Haldia into a petrochemicals hub. 

 We have approvals from both ministries. Dahej in Gujarat has also received the nod, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said on the sidelines of a function to launch Purulia Pumped Storage Project last evening. 

 Sources in Writers Buildings said Dalal Matt McDonald will carry out a feasibility study on the hub. They will assess the strengths and weaknesses and specify how work should move ahead, the sources added. 

 Bengal was one of the 14 states that lobbied the Centre for the petrochem hub, which it finally bagged with Gujarat. Even firms in Haldia had joined the state governments efforts in convincing the two ministries. Purnendu Chatterjee of Haldia Petrochemicals, representatives of Indian Oil Corporation and Mitsubishi Chemicals lent their voice to the demand for a hub. 

 State government sources said the presence of a naphtha cracker unit at HPL and a refinery of IOC made it easier for them to put the case before the ministries. 

 Bhattacharjee said the hub will help develop the entire region, including the Haldia port, which will be upgraded. The state government will float global tenders for the hub once Dalal Matt McDonald submits its report. The bidder will be asked to set up the infrastructure for making Haldia a destination for petrochem and chemical industries. This will enable the state to attract investors to Haldia, the officials added. 

 Earlier, IOC had offered to develop Haldia as a petrochemical hub at an investment of nearly Rs 5,000 crore. The proposal is still with us, state officials added.

Hinduja plants

 The Hinduja group is keen to invest in petrochemicals, gas and an automobile assembly unit. Bhattacharjee said Ashok Hinduja had met him on Thursday to discuss the plans. He is keen to bring in gas in the state. He has promised me that the Hindujas will be the first to bring in gas to the state, he said. The chief minister refused to provide details on the pipeline, though he said the groups interest in petrochemicals could have been kindled by the Centres clearance for a Haldia hub.

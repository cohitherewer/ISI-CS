 Calcutta, Oct. 28: The much-awaited special purpose tea fund to rejuvenate the industry will be in place by January, Union commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath said at the 40th annual general meeting of the Tea Association of India here today.

 The corpus of the fund will be Rs 400 crore and it will be routed through the Tea Board of India. The commerce minister had announced the decision to set up the fund at a conference in September 2004.

 As a medium and long-term measure, stepping up replantation and rejuvenation holds the key to competitiveness of the industry, given the high age profile of tea bushes in the country, Nath said.

 Over 2 lakh hectares of plantations, which fall in the vulnerable category of low yielding areas, will be targeted for replantation and rejuvenation.

 The minister made it clear that the social cost issue will be linked to the special tea fund. The industry has made several representations to the government on the social cost that they had to bear. An inter-ministerial committee has recommended that both the Centre and state governments should share the costs.

 However, Nath blamed the tea companies for not investing enough in the industrys rejuvenation in a highly-competitive global scenario.

 When profits are high, no re-investments are made, he said. Government packages will not be of any help in the long run and the industry will have to strategise on how to remain competitive in the increasingly changing global scenario in the beverages sector, he said.

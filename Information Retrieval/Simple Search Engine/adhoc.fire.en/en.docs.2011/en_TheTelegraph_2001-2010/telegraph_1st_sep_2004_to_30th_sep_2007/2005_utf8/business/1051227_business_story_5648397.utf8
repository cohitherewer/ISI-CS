 Glenmark on African safari

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 26: Glenmark Pharmaceuticals is acquiring Bouwer Bartlett, a South African sales and marketing company, for an undisclosed sum. 

 The acquisition would provide Glenmark a strategic entry into the South African market, one of the largest and fastest growing pharmaceutical markets in Africa. The deal was struck by Glenmark Pharmaceuticals SA (GPSA), its wholly-owned Swiss subsidiary.

 Glenmark said the benefits from the acquisition would be two-fold. Apart from a major presence in the dermatology segment, Bouwer Bartlett has a significant market in that country. This is expected to facilitate Glenmarks expansion in the South Africa. Glenmark expects its operations to clock up $3.1 million in the calendar year 2006.

 Glenmark is present in over 30 of the 54 markets in Africa and a representative office had been set up in South Africa in 2003. This was in addition to three other offices in Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria. The Bartlett deal is expected to consolidate its position further.

 Commenting on the acquisition, Glenn Saldanha, managing director and CEO, said, The purchase of Bouwer Bartlett is part of our long-term strategy to emerge as a speciality company which markets novel drugs. We plan to do this by acquiring front-ends in key markets outside the US, the EU and Japan.

 Early this month Glenmark joined hands with US-based InvaGen Pharmaceuticals Inc for the joint development, filing and marketing of seven generic pharmaceutical products in the US market. The product list includes a mixture of off-patent and patent-protected molecules with cumulative annual sales of about $4.1 billion. 

 InvaGen will develop and license to Glenmark, seven generic products. InvaGen will also file for the Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs), while Glenmark will be obtain regulatory approval in the US market.

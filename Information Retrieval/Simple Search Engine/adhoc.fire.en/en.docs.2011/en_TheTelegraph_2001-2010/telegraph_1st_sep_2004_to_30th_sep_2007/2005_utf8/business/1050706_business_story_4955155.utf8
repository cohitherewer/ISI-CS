 Jindal Steel in MoU rush 

 OUR BUREAU

 Ranchi/Bhubaneswar, July 5: Jindal Steel and Power Ltd today signed a memorandum of understanding with the Jharkhand government for a 5-million-tonne integrated steel plant and a 1000-mw captive power unit.

 Jindal Steel vice-chairman and managing director Navin Jindal said the Rs 12,500-crore investment will generate 10000 jobs, besides indirect employment for 30000 people. He also promised to generously execute the companys community development schemes in Jharkhand.

 Vice-chairman and chief operating officer V. Gujral signed the agreement on behalf of the company, while industries secretary Santosh Satpathi represented the government.

 Although the site of the proposed plant is undecided, Gujral said the company has informed the government of its preference for the area between Jamshedpur and Chandil, which is 30 kilometres from the steel city. A key factor influencing the preference is access to the Subarnarekha river, he said.

 Orissa project

 Jindal Steel and Power, which was planning a 2-million-tonne steel plant in Orissa, will ramp up the capacity of the project to six million tonnes and shift the site from Keonjhar to Angul district. 

 The blast furnace and the main production unit will now be set up in Angul district, while the ore-handling plant will be in Keonjhar, sources said.

 Naveen Jindal met Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Monday and submitted a revised proposal.

 GM gears up for job cuts

 Hard drive

 Detroit, Nov. 19 (Reuters): As General Motors Corporation prepares to announce much-awaited job cuts and the US assembly plant closing, analysts wonder if the cuts will be aggressive enough to convince people of a possible turnaround at the ailing auto giant. 

 The worlds largest automaker, which has lost nearly $4 billion this year, has said it will provide details by the end of 2005 about its previously announced plan to cut at least 25,000 manufacturing jobs as part of a broader restructuring plan. 

 Announcing the plan alone will not be enough, Standard amp; Poors equity analyst Efraim Levy said on Friday. If the plan is not concrete, not enough, or not realizable, Wall Street could take it negatively. 

 Chief executive Richard Wagoner has committed to a series of plant closing and the elimination of nearly a quarter of the companys US factory workforce through 2008. 

 They need to lose a lot more jobs through 2008. The 25,000 number is the natural attrition rate, and they need to go beyond the ordinary to accomplish any change. They need more, a lot more, Levy said. 

 GM has been grappling with high health-care and raw materials costs, loss of market share to foreign rivals in the US, and slumping sales of large sport utility vehicles which used to be its profit centre, but have now lost popularity due to high gasoline prices. 

 To make matters worse, GMs main parts supplier ? bankrupt Delphi Corp. ? is battling with its unions and will ask the court to void its labour contracts if a deal is not reached by mid-December. A strike at Delphi could shut down some GM and Delphi plants, and force GM to spend billions of dollars, analysts have said. 

 A work stoppage could also cripple GM, Delphis largest customer, as it prepares to roll out its GMT-900 truck series, a crucial component of its recovery plan. 

 Pressure mounts

 Wagoner said in June that the proposed cuts would save the automaker $2.5 billion a year. 

 But analysts worry about expenses associated with the cost cuts, and some estimates predict that early retirement and employee relocation costs could total up to $2 billion.

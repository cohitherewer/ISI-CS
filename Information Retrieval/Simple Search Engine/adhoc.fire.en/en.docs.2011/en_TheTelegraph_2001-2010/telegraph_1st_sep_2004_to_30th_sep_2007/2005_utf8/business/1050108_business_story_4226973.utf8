 Oriental Bank hints at discount in flotation

 Narang: Sweetener

 New Delhi, Jan. 7: Oriental Bank of Commerce is likely to price its public offering at a 10 per cent discount to the market.

 Though merchant bankers are yet to fix a price-line, senior officials said the bank is planning to offer it at a 5-10 per cent discount to the current traded price. 

 The Oriental Bank scrip is currently trading at around Rs 310 (face value of Rs 10) on Dalal Street. The bank intends to issue about 5 crore fresh shares. Priced at a 10 per cent discount, this translates into an offering worth Rs 1,400 crore. 

 Oriental Bank chairman-cum-managing director B. D. Narang told The Telegraph, ?People are advising us that there should be a discount on the market price ... after all we must help create wealth for small investors.?

 Narang said the bank hopes to utilise the fresh equity to fund its major expansion drive in the east, which will eventually ?see the bank?s turnover (total of advances and deposits) hit Rs 100,000 crore and profits reach Rs 2,000 crore by 2006?. 

 Analysts say this means a 25-30 per cent growth in a span of two years. However, if achieved, this could transform the predominantly north-based bank, with zero non-performing assets and low staff-to-turnover ratios, into a large national player, which will be able to compete with transnational entities that are fast appearing on the country?s shores. 

 The finance ministry has been trying to goad efficient state-run banks into leveraging their strengths and become bigger.

 Oriental Bank, which took over the ailing Global Trust Bank, plans to set up some 30-35 branches by redeploying 1,500 people to zones as part of its plans to become a national player. 

 ?We are getting a good response from minerals, steel and construction sectors,? said Narang. The bank is targeting to tap the potential of the mineral-based industries coming up in the east and new ports and highways, which are being set up to service them.

 ?By acquiring GTB, we have got a strong foothold in the south. Now we plan to expand in a bigger way in the east,? the chairman said. 

 The bank, which has reserves worth Rs 2,484 crore, is eyeing steel and power sectors as potential businesses in the east. 

 Oriental Bank currently has 1,000 branches and assets worth Rs 41,000 crore. By taking over GTB, it has added Rs 6,960 crore in assets.

 ?The whole gameplan is to remain lean and trim. We have 13,500 people at present and we absorbed another 1,300 when we took over GTB,? said Narang. 

 The chairman said he was looking at organic growth and would not take advantage of any merger and acquisition opportunities at the moment. ?I?d like to digest GTB first and dissolve some of my fat before turning hungry eyes at any other bank.?

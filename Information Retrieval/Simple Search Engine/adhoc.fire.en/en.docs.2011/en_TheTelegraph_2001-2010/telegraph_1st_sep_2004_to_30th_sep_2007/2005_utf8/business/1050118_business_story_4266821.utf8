 UTI Bank bottomline swells 35%

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Jan. 17: UTI Bank?s net profit rose 35 per cent in the third quarter to Rs 101.15 crore from Rs 74.86 crore in the corresponding previous period.

 At a board meeting held today, the directors have decided to raise fresh capital through an international offering with securities linked to ordinary shares in the form of global depository receipts. 

 The maximum number of ordinary shares to be issued will not exceed 46.56 million.

 The bank?s net interest income rose 26 per cent to Rs 187.03 crore from Rs 148.83 crore. Lower cost of funds, aided by a higher share of demand deposits, together with a rapid growth in assets, contributed to the rise in interest income.

 However, trading profit came down to Rs 42.88 crore compared with Rs 94.16 crore last year.

 The net interest margin declined to 2.90 per cent from 3.24 per cent.

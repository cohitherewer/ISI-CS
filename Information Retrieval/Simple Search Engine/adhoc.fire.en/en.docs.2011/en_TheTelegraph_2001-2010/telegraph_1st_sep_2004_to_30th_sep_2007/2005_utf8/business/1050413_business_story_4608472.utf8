 Levi Strauss back in black

 Brand recall 

 New York, April 12 (Reuters): Jeans maker Levi Strauss on Tuesday reported a quarterly profit as gross margins improved and demand for premium brands in Europe rose, helping reverse a year-ago loss.

 The company reported a net income of $47 million for the first quarter ended February 27, compared with a net loss of $2 million a year ago.

 Sales rose to $1.01 billion from $962 million.

 The San Francisco-based company said sales benefited primarily from improved performance of more premium Levi brand products in Europe and continued growth in the Levi?s business in Asia.

 Levi Strauss said reduced salary and wage expenses, and a reduction in distribution costs, helped offset a 7 per cent jump ? to $309 million ? in selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of increased advertising spending.

 Privately-held Levi Strauss has publicly traded debt.

 As of February 27, total debt, less cash was $2.11 billion, up $92 million, compared with $2.02 billion at the end of fiscal 2004, a company statement said.

 The increased net debt is primarily attributable to interest payments related to debt refinancing, the company said.

 As of April 3, Levi Strauss had total available liquidity of about $377 million, reflecting availability of $300 million under its credit facility and liquid short-term investments of $77 million.

 ?Companywide, we remain sharply focused on profitability and building all three of our brands. We are also very mindful that we are in a difficult and intensely competitive retail environment worldwide,? Phil Marineau, Levi Strauss chief executive officer said in a statement.

 In its efforts to reverse an eight-year sales slide, Levi Strauss has moved to end unprofitable lines and focus on expanding its core Levi products and the successful lower-priced Signature brand.

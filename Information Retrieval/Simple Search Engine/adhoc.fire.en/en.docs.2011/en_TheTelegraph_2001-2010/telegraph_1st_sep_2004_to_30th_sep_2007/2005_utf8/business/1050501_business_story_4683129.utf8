 SAIL in race to take over Neelachal

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, April 30: The Steel Authority of India (SAIL) is likely to take over Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd (NINL) for which several players, including those in the private sector, have evinced interest.

 The NINL takeover issue was discussed between chief minister Naveen Patnaik and Union minister for commerce and industry Kamal Nath in New Delhi on Friday.

 Set up in the mid-nineties, NINL, a 1.1-million-tonne pig iron joint venture between MMTC and the Orissa government, started commercial production in 2002. 

 The company is now planning to set up a one-million-tonne capacity steel plant to produce long products.

 Nath is understood to have told Patnaik that his ministry will have no objection to the takeover, subject to independent and fair valuation of shares and a definite commitment from SAIL regarding the expansion of NINL to a full-fledged integrated steel plant. MMTC and the state government are now evaluating the offer of SAIL.

 Nath also assured that the Centre would assist the Orissa government in creating industrial infrastructure at two locations at a cost of Rs 100 crore each. 

 While requesting the Union commerce minister for Japanese assistance to develop Paradip and Gopalpur SEZs, the chief minister also expressed the wish that National Institute of Design open a branch office in Bhubaneswar.

 Sugar selloff

 The Orissa government will sell the assets and business of the Baramba-based Cooperative Sugar Industries Limited to the Lucknow-based Balaji Sugar and Allied Industries for Rs 8.28 crore.

 The committee on disinvestment under the chairmanship of chief minister Naveen Patnaik has decided that Balaji would pay Rs 1 crore in the first year and the balance Rs 7.28 crore in 10 equal annual instalments from the second year of commercial production.

 An interest of 4 per cent will be charged on the deferred amount from the fourth year onwards if the new management fails to clear the amount within the stipulated time.

 After Shakti Sugar abandoned the management of the factory, the cooperative department managed the mill with a loan of Rs 6.5 crore from commercial banks.

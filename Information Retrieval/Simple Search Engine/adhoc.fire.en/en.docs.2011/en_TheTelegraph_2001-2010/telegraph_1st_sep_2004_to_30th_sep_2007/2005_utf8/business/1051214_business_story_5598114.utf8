 Farmers make their point

 Hong Kong, Dec. 13: Radical anti-WTO activists succeeded in making their point here today with several protesting farmers getting injured in a police baton charge as they tried to get through the outer security cordon of the WTO convention centre. Some NGO delegates were also evicted from the opening ceremony for staging a noisy protest.

 Police used tear gas and batons to drive back the protesting farmers, who were mainly from South Korea, and some of them were carried away on stretchers. The NGO delegates, who had entered the premises on valid passes, were bundled out unceremoniously.

 The Hong Kong police chief later held a press conference, aired by local TV channels, to state that the police had used minimal force as the protesting farmers turned violent and tried to force their way through the high security barricade. As reporters tried to grill him on the issue, he maintained that the police had acted with great restraint in the matter.

 The farmers started staging their protests this morning at the central park earmarked for them by the Hong Kong police. The park is situated about 2 km away from the convention centre. However, as the afternoon plenary session started, the protestors upped the ante and moved to the barricades. 

 A contingent of 15-odd Indian farmers ? some clad in khadi kurtas ? walked side by side their South Korean counterparts attired in western clothes and Reebok shoes shouting slogans of Down down WTO at the central park this morning. Live bands and the beating of drums accompanied the anti-WTO songs and sloganeering at the park.

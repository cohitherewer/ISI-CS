 Calcutta, Nov. 16: Power rates in Bengal may come down next year if the revenue earned by the state electricity board (WBSEB) from export of power is taken into account while calculating tariff proposals. 

 The Bengal government wants the state electricity regulatory commission to consider this aspect in the tariff proposal for 2006-07.

 While the Bengal power board always wants rates to be raised to shore up revenues, if the money earned from power export is considered it will certainly impact tariff.

 The move will bring down tariff of WBSEB and address the cross-subsidy issue as well, said Sunil Mitra, Bengals power secretary, at the inaugural function of PowerMart 2005 ? a two-day conference organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.

 WBSEB had earned Rs 717.65 crore in 2004-05 from power export. In the first six months of this fiscal, the board has earned Rs 265 crore. It sells off-peak power at Rs 3.14 per unit and peak power at Rs 3.94 per unit. 

 Power industry sources say the regulator may not take into consideration the entire export revenue when it calculates the tariff for 2006-07. Therefore, the government is building up its case in advance.

 In 2005-06, the tariff for domestic consumers of WBSEB went up, while that for industrial consumers fell. The average tariff of WBSEB is now Rs 3.26 per unit.

 To facilitate export of surplus power from the state, the Bengal government recently held a meeting with Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, Central Electricity Authority and the Union power ministry to set up a transmission corridor. This will make evacuation of power to energy deficient states much easier, the power secretary said.

 Bengal power minister Mrinal Banerjee said the state utilities have all turned around and WBSEB has been able to register an operational surplus. 

 The West Bengal Power Development Corporation has paid a dividend for the first time to the government, the minister said.

 WBSEB chairman M.K. De said the board has been able to reduce the transmission and distribution losses from as high as 40 per cent to 26 per cent. Banerjee assured CII members that the government would provide electricity to all the villages by 2007.

 New Delhi, Nov. 16: GAIL (India) Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) will jointly hunt for oil and gas exploration as well as production opportunities in India and overseas. The two companies today signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to this effect.

 The duo will also form separate joint venture companies for implementing city gas projects in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat. 

 According to the MoU, GAIL and HPCL will jointly prepare a blue print for the exploration and production (E amp;P) business in India and overseas, said GAIL chairman Proshanto Banerjee. 

 A joint team of GAIL and HPCL will identify projects in south and south-east Asia, West Asia, Africa, Australia, Russia and the east European countries, he added.

 Once the projects are identified, GAIL and HPCL will enter into specific MoUs or set up special purpose vehicles to jointly bid and implement the projects on a case-to-case basis, Banerjee said. 

 The two firms are also seeking special dispensation from the government for securing approvals for overseas investments in exploration projects, similar to those given to ONGC Videsh and the Indian Oil-Oil India combine.

 The Centre clears OVL projects through a high-level fast-track mechanism that cuts through red tape and enables the company to meet the tight bidding schedules required for acquiring overseas assets. It also extends special bank guarantees for such investments. GAIL and HPCL expect to get this support. 

 Banerjee said co-operation between the two firms is already yielding results through its joint participation in an E amp;P bidding round in Australia last month. The two companies will also jointly bid for E amp;P blocks offered under Nelp and coal-bed methane assets in India. 

 Under the deal for city gas projects, the duo will supply piped natural gas to domestic, commercial and industrial users and compressed natural gas and LPG for automobiles.

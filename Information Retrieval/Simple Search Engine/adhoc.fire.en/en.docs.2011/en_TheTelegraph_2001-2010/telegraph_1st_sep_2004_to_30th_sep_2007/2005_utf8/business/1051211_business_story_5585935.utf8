The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 FM lists hurdles to growth

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Dec. 10: The sluggishness in the coal and electricity sectors is putting a strain on the overall growth of the economy, Union finance minister P. Chidambaram said at the consular corps business session here today.

 In the first six months of this fiscal, the gross domestic product growth was 8.1 per cent. However, he said, for the full year, the growth would be over 7 per cent.

 Chidambaram said a growth of more than 8 per cent could have been achieved if these two sectors had done well.

 We have coal reserves that can serve us for 200-300 years. But we do not have a legal and economic framework to exploit coal. Sometimes coal companies say it is more profitable to close down rather than running them, the finance minister said.

 The government has set a target of providing electricity to all by 2012. But Chidambaram feels that the sector is bogged down in a model where there is no incentive for generation, distribution and transmission. This has to change, he said.

 Airport update

 On the modernisation of airports, the finance minister said the bids for Calcutta and Chennai would be opened in January, while for Mumbai and Delhi, the name of the developers would be announced within December 31.

 Regarding the small and medium enterprise sector, he said that a bill was pending in Parliament and it proposed to raise the amount of capital subsidy and enhance credit flow to the sector. 

 Chidambaram said India, which had already signed a free trade agreement with Thailand and a comprehensive economic co-operation agreement with Singapore, is also in the process of signing similar pacts with the Asean and Japan.

 EPF rate

 Asked if the Centre was ready to raise the EPF rate by 1 percentage point, the finance minister said the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) trustee board, which had announced an 8.5 per cent rate for the year 2005-06, would have to fund the deficit of Rs 365 crore from its own resources.

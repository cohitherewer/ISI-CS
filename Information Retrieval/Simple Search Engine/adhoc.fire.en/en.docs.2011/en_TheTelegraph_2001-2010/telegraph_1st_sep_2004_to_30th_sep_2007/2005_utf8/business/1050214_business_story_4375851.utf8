 Short-term hiring firms hard at work

 Mumbai, Feb. 13: Temporary staffing through professional employer organisations is fast catching up in India.

 The Ma Foi Employment Survey showed that temporary staff comprised nearly 11.7 per cent of the employee base of the companies scanned.

 The survey predicts an increase of 11.47 per cent by the end of this quarter, taking the staff base to 12.84 per cent. 

 Temporary staffing services is common in developed countries as it provides an easy exit option to a company in a lean season. In India, the demand for temporary staff was driven by the information technology-enabled services (ITeS) like call-centres.

 The quarter ending March 2005 will see two unlikely states ? Himachal Pradesh and Orissa ? taking recourse to temporary staffing services in a big way. The states will see a growth of 50 per cent and 42.86 per cent respectively, with big companies setting up base in their states.

 Leading FMCG companies have set up factories in Himachal Pradesh, while Orissa has ignited the interests of Tata Steel, Sterlite Industries, Posco of Korea and BHP. Temporary staff as a percentage of total employees account for 31.03 per cent and 5 per cent in Himachal Pradesh and Orissa respectively.

 Uttar Pradesh and Bengal will see a negative growth of 15.16 per cent and 5.24 per cent respectively, according to the survey. Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan will, however, report a higher composition of temporary staff as a percentage of total strength. In Chhattisgarh, more than half of the employees surveyed (almost 52 per cent) are on a temporary basis, while such staff account for 40 per cent in Rajasthan.

 Ma Foi Management Services managing director K. Pandirajan said temporary services will increase as Indian labour laws across states allow companies to use this mode liberally.

 ?In Holland, even pluckers in tulip farms are hired through temporary agencies,? he added.

 Temporary staff strength as a percentage of total employees will decline from 8.95 per cent in December to 8.56 per cent by March in the east, while western states will see a rise from 5.69 per cent to 6.54 per cent, predicts Ma Foi.

 The maximum representation for temporary staff is in the north comprising more than one-fourth of the people employed. It will be 25.23 per cent by March, up from 23.57 per cent in December.

 The top 10 sectors that would use flexi staffing in this quarter include hospitality, print, media and entertainment, energy, education, training and consultancy, IT and textiles and garments.

 The print, media and entertainment sector will comprise 16.46 per cent of temporary staff by March, reflecting a growth of 33.73 per cent from 12.84 per cent.

 The infrastructure sector will carry the highest representation of temporary staff at 41.71 per cent by March against 39.07 per cent in December as the Golden Quadrilateral project implementation speeds up.

 Transportation and logistics at 24.95 per cent, the hospitality industry at 20.21 per cent and auto and ancillaries at 19.89 per cent form the bulwark of the industries that use flexi staff. The ITeS sector has shown a dip in the composition of temporary staff as more and more companies want to retain employees.

 Whetted by the huge opportunity in temporary staffing, leading multinational companies like Manpower, Ma Foi, Kelly Services and Adecco SA have already set up bases in India and are growing rapidly. LG, Alcatel, Reliance Infocomm, Bharti Tele-Ventures, Du Pont and Pfizer are appointing flexi staff in large numbers.

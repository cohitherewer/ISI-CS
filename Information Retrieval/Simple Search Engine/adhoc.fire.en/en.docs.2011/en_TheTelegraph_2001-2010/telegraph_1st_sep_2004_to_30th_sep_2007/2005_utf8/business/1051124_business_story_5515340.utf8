 Insurance regulator backs higher FDI 

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Rao: Plainspeak

 New Delhi, Nov. 23: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) wants the FDI ceiling in the insurance sector to be raised from 26 to 49 per cent. 

 It need not be repeated. We have always said it (FDI cap) should be raised to 49 per cent, IRDA chairman C. S. Rao told newspersons on the sidelines of a conference organised by Ficci today.

 Domestic companies, which have formed joint ventures with multinational insurers, have been maintaining that a hike in FDI limit is necessary for infusing funds into the sector.

 The Left parties have opposed any move to enhance the FDI limit to 49 per cent. Moreover, the ceiling can be raised only by amending the IRDA Act, which specifies a 26 per cent limit in FDI in the insurance sector.

 The FDI limit in insurance has been a major area of difference between the UPA government and the Left, with the latter opposing the move.

 The IRDA chairman said the regulator would announce specific guidelines for unit-linked insurance policies (ULIPs) and also submit a report on comprehensive insurance legislation.

 We are compiling a report. We will submit it to the government in two weeks, Rao said. 

 On ULIP schemes, he said the guidelines will be issued in the coming two to three weeks. There are some crucial issues that need to be ironed out, particularly those pertaining to the relationship between the premium and insurance cover and investment. 

 There are indications that the IRDA may fix a minimum percentage of premium for insurance cover.

 Earlier, speaking at the conference he said, ULIPs have been the primary driver of growth in the life insurance segment. 

 On motor insurance, Rao said companies have agreed to a detariffed regime from January 2007. There are, however, apprehensions regarding insurance of older vehicles.

 He also exhorted the industry to seriously look into the issue of irregularities in training, examination process and lack of experience in underwriting. 

 Another area of concern, according to the regulator, is the sub-contracting of sale of insurance policies by corporate agents to untrained sub-agents.

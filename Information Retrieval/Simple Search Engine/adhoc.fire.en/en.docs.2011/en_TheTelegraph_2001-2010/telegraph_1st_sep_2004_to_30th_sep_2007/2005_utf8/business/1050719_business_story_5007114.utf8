 Calcutta, July 18: Switzerland-based Flaktwoods today said India will serve as a production hub for West Asia and Southeast Asia. 

 Flaktwoods makes industrial air movement applications and underground metro ventilation systems.

 Flakt India has two manufacturing units in Calcutta and Chennai.

 We are upgrading both the manufacturing units. India will serve as a component sourcing base for the parent company. Next year, the amount of component sourced from here will go up to 10 million euro, Flakt India managing director and chief executive officer Anil Baijal said.

 Flakt India, which registered a turnover of Rs 60 crore in 2004 (Jan-Dec) expects to achieve a 20 per cent growth in the current year. The company has already achieved an annually compounded volume growth of over 70 per cent.

 Flakt has launched the Centripal HK Fans in India. The new range of fans address the industrial concerns of space, noise pollution, trouble-free operation and natural vibration levels.

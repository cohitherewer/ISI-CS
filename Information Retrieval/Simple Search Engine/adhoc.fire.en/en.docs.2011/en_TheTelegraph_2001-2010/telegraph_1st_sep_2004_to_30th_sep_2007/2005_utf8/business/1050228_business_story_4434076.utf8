 PSU banks pin hopes on FII cap hike

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Feb. 27: Finance minister P. Chidambaram may increase the 20 per cent FII ceiling in the public sector (PSU) banks ? a move which could endear foreign investors to these stocks.

 Even as the possibility of hiking FII limits in PSU banks appear reasonable, opinions are sharply divided on whether the finance minister would undertake a similar measure with regard to foreign direct investment (FDI) in private sector banks.

 While lifting the 10 per cent voting rights cap in these banks could be a positive sign emerging from the 2005-06 proposals, it is largely felt that Chidambaram would not make such a move, which could antagonise the Left parties.

 Last October, Chidambaram had said foreign banks may be allowed to pick up a 10 per cent stake in domestic private sector banks every year and acquire control over these banks in three to four years.

 With the Left parties already making their stand clear over the move to raise FDI in telecom to 74 per cent, a policy implementation in banks also seems unlikely.

 For the FIIs, the lifting of the 20 per cent ceiling in nationalised banks could not come at a more opportune time. The PSU banks are now on a high after the government last Tuesday granted them more autonomy in acquisitions, entering or exiting businesses, merger of unviable branches and setting up overseas offices.

 Moreover, amid signs of a 7 per cent growth rate in the economy from about 6 per cent, bankers, too, are enthused with advances in the corporate and retail front poised for a robust growth. 

 FIIs have already started ramping up their holdings in select public sector banks. In the case of Punjab National Bank (PNB), their holding has risen to over 14 per cent in December 31 against 5.5 per cent in March.

 However, their holding in State Bank of India (SBI) is stagnant at over 11 per cent for the past couple of years. This can change with the removal of the 20 per cent ceiling.

 With the nationalised banking space set to witness consolidation in the months to come, Chidambaram is also seen to encourage this by giving tax benefits.

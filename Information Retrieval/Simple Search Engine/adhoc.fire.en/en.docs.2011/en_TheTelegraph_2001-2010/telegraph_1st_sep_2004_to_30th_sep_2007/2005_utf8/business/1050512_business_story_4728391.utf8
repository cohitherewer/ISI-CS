 Purnendu sounds banks for Basell

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Chatterjee: Resource research

 Calcutta, May 11: Purnendu Chatterjee has made overtures to Indian banks and financial institutions (FIs) for funds to help him close the Basell Polyolefins deal.

 ?We are talking to a number of banks in India. The banks and FIs dealing with Haldia Petrochemicals are being approached,? the head of The Chatterjee Group (TCG) said.

 The banks and financial institutions can either invest in the equity or provide loans to Basell, which was snapped up by TCG and Russian billionaire Leonard Blavatnik?s Access Industries for $5.7 billion last week.

 Banking industry sources say Chatterjee is talking to State Bank of India, the largest public sector bank in the country which has lent HPL more than Rs 1,000 crore. ?There have been some talks on Basell. We are evaluating the proposal,? senior SBI officials told The Telegraph.

 Union Bank of India, Allahabad Bank, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, United Bank of India, StanChart Bank, IDBI, ICICI Bank and IFCI have also funded HPL.

 O. N. Singh, chairman and managing director of Allahabad Bank, said: ?The TCG chief has not talked to us yet. But if we get a proposal, we may invest in Basell.? He described Haldia Petrochem, which has borrowed Rs 400 crore from his bank, as ?more or less a good debtor?.

 As Chatterjee tries to drum up funds for Basell ? he got Merrill Lynch to commit $3 billion to $3.3 billion in loans ? he has had to reckon with the departure of ICICI Venture Fund Management Company, a fully owned subsidiary of ICICI Bank, from the TCG-led consortium.

 The ICICI arm has claimed that it was never part of the consortium. ?Like all other proposals, we had evaluated Basell?s as well. Since it did not suit us, we have stayed out of it. We are not investing,? sources said.

 Chatterjee did not appear convinced. He said the pullout, even before the nitty-gritty of the buyout has been laid out, is a choice made by ICICI Venture, though he was not aware of its exit. ?I do not know of any decision by ICICI Venture to back out,? the TCG chief said.

 HPL role

 Asked if HPL will be part of Basell, Chatterjee said it depended on the Bengal government. 

 ?We need their co-operation for making HPL invest in Basell. We are in talks with the government,? said Chatterjee, who is keen to buy out the state government in HPL and become the single-largest shareholder of the Rs 5,170-crore firm.

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: Skoda Auto India will increase the production capacity at its Aurangabad plant by the middle of 2006.

 Currently, we are doubling our capacity from 15,000 to 30,000 units. In addition, we are looking at expanding this further by June next year, said managing director Imran Hassen at the launch of Octavia Combi here today.

 He refused to divulge further. It is too early to say by how much the capacity will be enhanced. All I can say is it would be 30,000 plus.

 Hassen also did not give details regarding the automobile companys investment plans in India. Investment is an ongoing process and is made in phases. However, we will not comment on it any further.

 Skoda Auto India, a subsidiary of Skoda Auto, introduced Octavia Combi in two versions.

 While the Combi sports the look of a perfect station wagon, officials did not slot it in any category. You can only call it a family car. It cannot be slotted in any bracket, they said.

 The RS (rally sport) variant is priced at Rs 13,85,340, while the L and K models sport a price tag of Rs 14,45,886. Skoda targets to sell 3,000 Combis by next year.

 Globally, the Combi sells best in Europe, China and West Asia. In Europe alone, officials said 40 per cent Skoda cars sold are Combis.

 Hassen said the company is aiming at a growth of 30-40 per cent with sales of around 9,000-10,000 cars this year. It has also planned a series of launches for the Indian market, including the Superb Diesel in November.

 Hassen said the company is planning to introduce its top-end DSG technology (which reduces power consumption during gear shifts) equipped car, code-named A5, during the first quarter of next year.

 We will introduce a new technology every 6-8 weeks in all our models, which will be launched till 2006, he said.

 According to officials, the launch of the much-hyped Fabia, which has been delayed by another seven to eight months, is expected to come in the second half of next year.

 Recently, Skoda had said it would make India an export hub for the South Asian region. We have already started exporting to Bangladesh in July. Now we are looking at similar opportunities in Sri Lanka and Nepal, Hassen had said.

 Co-op funds linked to full RBI control 

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Calcutta, March 1: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has to play an important role if the states seek recapitalisation funds to revitalise co-operative banks and societies in line with the A. Vaidyanathan committee report.

 In the Union Budget for 2005-06, finance minister P. Chidambaram has linked the recap fund for the co-operative sector to the handing of its entire jurisdiction to the RBI.

 At present, the state government looks after the administration and audit of the co-operative sector and the RBI supervises the banking activity. 

 To cleanse the balancesheet of the co-operative system, the Vaidyanathan committee on revival of co-operative credit and banking institutions has assessed a recap amount of about Rs 15,000 crore. Of this, about Rs 11,000 crore is to be shared among the Centre, states and co-operatives in the ratio of 53:31:16.

 Co-operative banks in India, with a few exceptions, are in a shambles. Six state central co-operative banks and their 140 district central counterparts do not comply with Section 11 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. They also have difficulty in accessing refinance for agricultural credit.

 Alarmed by the seriousness of the situation, the finance minister had appointed the committee to examine the reforms required in the co-operative banking system. The recommendations of the committee include: 

 Special financial assistance to wipe out accumulated losses and strengthen the capital base of co-operative credit institutions; 

 Institutional restructuring to ensure democratic institutions; and 

 Changes in the legal framework to empower the RBI to enforce prudent financial management.

 Chidambaram has said in the budget, ?I propose to accept the report in principle. I also propose to call state governments for consultation and begin the process of implementing the recommendations in the states that show willingness to accept them.? 

 Finance minister?s announcement in the budget has already created furore in the co-opertaive sector and the Bengal government has decided to gang up with other states and make a formal representation to the finance minister.

 Samir Kumar Ghosh, chairman of the West Bengal State Co-operative Bank, said, ?The National Federation of State Co-operative Banks will meet on March 22 where the matter will be discussed.?

 The government intends to continue with its effort to turn the focus of commercial banks, regional rural banks (RRBs) and co-operative banks towards providing credit, especially production credit, to rural and farm households.

 In 2005-06, the government has kept a target of disbursing Rs 108,500 crore to the rural sector.

 Hitachi ups stake in Tata venture

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Dec. 9: Hitachi Construction Machinery (HCM) is doubling its stake in Telco Construction Equipment (Telcon) to 40 per cent for an undisclosed sum. 

 The company is a joint venture with Tata Motors, whose holding will now fall from 80 per cent to 60 per cent. The Hitachi firm hopes a higher stake will help it bring about greater co-ordination between itself and Telcon.

 According to a release issued by the Tata group today, the new shareholders agreement signed between the three companies envisages greater co-operation between HCM and Telcon. Under the pact, Hitachi will source components and machines from Telcon, introduce a wider range and set up a development facility. 

 The new arrangement will help Telcon to significantly improve its product offerings to customers and help it evolve as a global manufacturing and design hub, the release said. The agreement was signed by Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Motors, S. Dazai, president amp; CEO of HCM and J. K. Setna, chairman of Telcon.

 Telcon was floated in 1999 as an arm of Tata Motors, which spun off of its construction equipment business. In 2000, the Tatas offered 20 per cent to Hitachi Construction.

 Telcon designs, manufactures, assembles and sells all services related to earth-moving machinery and construction equipment. It has units in Jamshedpur and Dharwad and a marketing network in 65 towns of the country. It makes hydraulic excavators, crawler cranes, wheel loaders, backhoe loaders, dumpers and motor graders.

 The company had a turnover of Rs 926 crore and a net profit of Rs 40 crore in 2004-05. For the first half of this fiscal, the corresponding figures were Rs 567 crore and Rs 28 crore.

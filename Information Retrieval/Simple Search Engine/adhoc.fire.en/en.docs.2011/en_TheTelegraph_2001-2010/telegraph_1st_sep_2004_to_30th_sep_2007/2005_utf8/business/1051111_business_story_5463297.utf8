 Calcutta, Nov. 10: Indian Banks? Association (IBA) has formed technical groups to study if the savings bank rate needs to be freed. It will submit its report to the government. 

 Talking to reporters on the eve of Becon (Bankers? Conference) 2005, H.N. Sinor, chief executive of IBA, said: ?The Reserve Bank of India asked us to set up groups for preparation of discussion papers on review and deregulation of savings bank rates. We have recently set up two such groups, which will also look into the question of deregulating rates on loans up to Rs 2 lakh.?

 The RBI is ready to give banks a free run on fixing the savings bank rate. However, at a time when interest rates are on their way up, such a move might lead to a situation where some banks start offering more. With competition intensifying, no bank would prefer to bring down the rate from its current level of 3.5 per cent, bankers say.

 The Reserve Bank of India had, in its annual policy statement of April this year, recognised that there was still a strong case for further deregulation of interest rates. 

 Away from rates, Sinor said the IBA would soon come up with a comprehensive fair practices code that will serve as a base document for banking standards in the country.

 The Banking Code and Standards Board of India will be set up under the aegis of RBI. The board, which will consist of five members, is likely to be based in Mumbai.

 He said that guidelines for the code to be finalised within a month would also apply to the credit-card business.

 Asked whether the standards would be universal, Sinor said participation would be voluntary, and the guidelines would have to be approved by the boards of banks.

 The standards board will have a chief executive officer, who will be assisted by a team of relationship managers. It will also have a representative of customers. 

 On allowing foreign direct investment (FDI) in the asset reconstruction companies, the IBA chief said there would be movement of hard cash, not security receipts against the impaired loans, once foreign funds flow in.

 Earlier, at the same press conference on Becon 2005, V. Sridar, chairman and managing director of Uco Bank, said the theme of this year?s conference is ?Indian Banking: Opportunities at the bottom of the pyramid.? The city-based bank is hosting the conclave this year.

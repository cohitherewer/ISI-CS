 Retail FDI still on govt agenda

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, May 11: The Congress-led UPA government is considering a proposal to open up the domestic retail sector to transnational players like Walmart, Metro AG and Tesco despite the groundswell of protest from its Left allies.

 Foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail, first mooted by the commerce ministry, is still being discussed, finance minister P. Chidambaram said here today on the sidelines of the launch of an e-payment facility for excise duties.

 US and European embassies have been lobbying hard on behalf of their retail chains to get the government to open up the market. 

 Among big names, US retailing giant Wal-Mart has shown keen interest in landing on Indian shores, as has UKs Tesco, Frances Carrefour and the German Metro group.

 Wal-Marts international president John B. Menzer is due to visit India later this week for confabulations with top Indian leaders, adding a touch of significance to the deliberations on the proposal within the government.

 The Left parties feel the move will jeopardise the livelihoods of millions of small shop-owners and workers. Both the CPM and CPI are displeased with the proposal to open up retail trade to high-end brand names. 

 Sometime back, RSP leader and Left-UPA coordination committee member Abani Roy had written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh seeking a far more serious consideration ... before the government decides on a course of action as this will mean a deathblow to millions of tiny independent stores and some 25 million workers they support. He also warned that joblessness created by the move could spark a socio-economic revolt in the hinterland.

 The letter was followed up by notes from other Left parties seeking consultations on the issue. The Left had started gearing itself for action ever since commerce minister Kamal Nath was quoted by the London-based Financial Times as saying that the the government favoured high-end retail names to invest directly in India. What has riled them most is Naths argument on how the move would not affect mom and pop stores. 

 Top finance ministry officials, however, support the plan and feel it could prove to be a goldmine in terms of foreign investment.

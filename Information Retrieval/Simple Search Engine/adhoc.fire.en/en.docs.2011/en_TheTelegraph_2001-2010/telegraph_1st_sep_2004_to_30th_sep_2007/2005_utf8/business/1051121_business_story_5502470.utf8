The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Q amp;A

 Rest assured

 I regularly invest in ELSS and have already invested around Rs 35,000 in the current year and plan to invest another Rs 40,000 to get section 80C benefits. Now with the notification of the finance ministry on November 3, shall I get the tax benefits?

 Sudeshna Boxi, by e-mail

 The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) has clarified that ELSS investments made on or after April 1, 2005, will be eligible for tax benefit under section 80 C.

 Home front

 I have taken a home loan from ICICI Bank and my EMI deduction has started from July 2005. As the house is still under construction and I have not got the possession, can I claim tax benefits on the housing loan?

 Sunil Kumar, Jamshedpur

 Yes, you can claim the tax benefits on the principal and interest repayment of the housing loan from the current financial year.

 Premium pleasure

 I have taken an insurance policy for my son who is 17 years old. Shall I be able to enjoy the tax benefits even after he attains majority or gets employed?

 Amit Kumar Das, Calcutta

 You will be able to enjoy the tax benefits as long as you continue to pay the premiums for the policy. However, if your son starts paying the premium, he will be able to claim the benefits.

 Money order

 My son who stays abroad sends me money regularly as gift. Do I have to pay tax on the amount?

 Roshan Saqib, by e-mail

 Any amount of money received as gift from relatives 

 is exempt from tax. Here, relatives include spouses, 

 brothers and sisters, brothers and sisters-in-law, maternal 

 and paternal uncles and aunts, lineal ascendants and 

 descendants and their spouses. Thus, the gift from your 

 son is exempt from tax.

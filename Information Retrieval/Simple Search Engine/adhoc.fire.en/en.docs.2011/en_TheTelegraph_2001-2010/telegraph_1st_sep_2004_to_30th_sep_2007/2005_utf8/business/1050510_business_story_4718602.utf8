The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 B amp;O tunes in for rich returns

 GARIMA SINGH

 New Delhi, May 9: Bang 

 amp; Olufsen (B amp;O), the 500-million-euro Danish high-end 

 home entertainment systems company, is drawing up aggressive 

 plans to carve up a slice of the market for premium products.

 Entering India through the master dealer route, the importers of these products are eyeing a Rs 50-crore turnover in 2005-06.

 Opening its first outlet in India at a shopping plaza attached to the Grand Hyatt in Mumbai early this month, the company plans to open a total of three outlets this calendar year. This includes a showroom in Delhi, which opened recently, and one in Bangalore in September.

 A showroom in Calcutta will come 

 up early next year as part of a five-year plan to open some 

 15 more outlets. B amp;O also plans to set up shop in Chandigarh, 

 Amritsar, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad.

 B amp;O, which manufactures televisions, 

 music systems, loudspeakers, telephones, medical, and multimedia 

 products in Denmark, plans to adopt a uniform pricing strategy 

 across the world.

 ?Minus the tax structure, which 

 varies across the world, our retail prices will be comparable 

 across destinations,? said Prakash Ramsingh, managing director 

 of B amp;O India.

 The company said it pays an import duty of nearly 38 to 42 per cent per unit on its products.

 Starting at Rs 3 lakh for an audio system, its buyers largely include hotels, corporate houses and a niche segment of retail customers.

 ?To start with, we are eyeing a meagre 0.5 per cent market share covering approximately a million families. In about five years, the total market size is expected to grow to two million families,? Ramsingh said.

 B amp;Os entry into India 

 is part of its expansion plan in the west and central Asia, 

 which started in 2000. It is largely present in Scandinavia 

 and parts of western Europe.

 At present, B amp;O sources components 

 from big brands like Hitachi and Philips to manufacture 

 its products.

 Ramsingh said, ?We hope each showroom will contribute sales worth Rs 10 to 20 crore.? He said the firm planned to spend up to Rs 3 crore in setting up each sales point.

 While half of these showrooms 

 will be owned by B amp;O India, the remaining will be given 

 to franchisees ?who are big retailers in lifestyle products 

 with a passion for design?. 

 The company has pegged its marketing budget at Rs 1-2 crore each year.

 Founded in 1925 in Struer, Denmark, Bang amp; Olufsen acoustic systems are renowned for a distinctive range of quality consumer electronic products.

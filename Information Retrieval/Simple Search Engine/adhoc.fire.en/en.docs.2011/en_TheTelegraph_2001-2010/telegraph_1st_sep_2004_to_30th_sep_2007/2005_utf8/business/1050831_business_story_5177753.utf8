 Oil firms eye Norway JVs

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Aug. 30: The Oil India-Indian Oil combine is considering a tie-up with Statoil of Norway, while ONGC is in talks with Norsk Hydro, a smaller Norwegian state-owned company, for technical collaboration and joint ventures in the upstream sector. 

 The Norwegian companies have cutting-edge technology in deep-sea oil exploration. Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar feels Indian companies could do with some help as they have not been able strike oil despite heavy investments. He feels foreign knowhow could provide the breakthrough.

 Additional secretary Talmiz Ahmed said in a telephonic conversation from Oslo that Aiyar will hold talks with his Norwegian counterpart tomorrow to pave the way for an MoU between the Indian and Norwegian companies. 

 These companies could then jointly scout for oil and gas exploration opportunities in Africa, Latin America and Russia and the Caspian region.

 Ahmed said discussions were also being held on the safety aspects of offshore operations in view of the Mumbai High tragedy so that Indian companies could get an exposure to the best global practices. The minister will be visiting a Norwegian offshore oil platform tomorrow to get a feel of operations there. ONGC and OIL officials are accompanying him.

 V.K. Sibal, director-general of hydrocarbons, will be holding talks with his Norwegian counterpart to improve the Indian regulatory mechanism by drawing on features of that countrys regime.

 The petroleum minister will also be visiting Iceland as the country has made considerable headway in using hydrogen as an alternative to fossil fuels.

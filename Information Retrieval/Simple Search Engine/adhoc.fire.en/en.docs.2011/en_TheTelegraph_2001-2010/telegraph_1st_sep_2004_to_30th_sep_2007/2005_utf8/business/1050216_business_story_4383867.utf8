 Birlas pledge support to Pansari

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Feb. 15: The Birla family today pledged support to Rajendra Prasad Pansari, the man behind the criminal case against Rajendra Singh Lodha, S. M. Prasad, V. Gourishankar and S. K. Daga.

 Supreme Court lawyer Ram Jethmalani said this in the high court while arguing before Justice P. N. Sinha. He was explaining the locus of Pansari with regard to the criminal case, which Pansari had filed in Alipore Court accusing Lodha and three others of conspiracy, cheating, forgery of will and destruction of documents. 

 After Prasad moved the high court seeking quashing of the case, lawyers representing Prasad raised questions on the locus of Pansari, a confidant of the Birla family.

 But clearing the doubts, Jethmalani said the country?s first business family would give all assistance to Pansari. He also contended that Lodha had committed a breach of his obligations and committed a huge fraud on the properties of the trusts meant for charity, and added that for having committed such a crime there was no reason why the chartered accountant should not go to the jail. 

 According to the Birla family, all the assets of the MP Birla group were owned by five trusts ? Priyamvada Birla Trust, Priyamvada Birla Fund, Priyamvada Birla Kosh, Priyamvada Birla Nidhi and M. P. Birla Trust, which the couple created ?concurrently and mutually? in 1988. Three charitable institutions ? Hindustan Medical Institution, East India Educational Institution and M. P. Birla Foundation ? were nominated to inherit most of the assets owned by the five trusts after her death.

 Pansari, in his complaint, alleged that Lodha had fraudulently dissolved these trusts to hijack the properties from charitable institutions and use them for personal benefits.

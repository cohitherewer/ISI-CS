 Going places

 Calcutta, July 17: The domestic animation industry is entering into agreements with other countries to boost growth and help infuse funds for projects.

 An Indo-Italian treaty is already in place. It is followed by a pact with the UK. This will allow domestic firms to collaborate with companies in these countries and source funds from Italy and the UK, said Bhuvan Lall, a representative of the Animation Producers Association of India (APAI).

 The treaty allows Indian companies to access overseas markets and enter into co-production for projects.

 Recently, Mumbais Crest Animation Studios has partnered with the US-based Mainframe Entertainment (ME) and Lions Gate Family Entertainment (LGFE) to create a feature film ? Arthurs Missing Pal.

 A few more treaties will be in place by the year-end and will give us access to more markets overseas, added Lall. Animators are also in demand in Thailand, Malaysia, France, Canada and Taiwan.

 APAI is also studying the growth pattern of the animation industry in China, France and Korea to propose regulations to boost the domestic market.

 The study is part of the industrys attempt to create a buoyant domestic market and local animated characters that can be used to showcase the countrys talent overseas.

 China has set up a chain of national animation studios and research institutes. Local broadcast authorities are required to give full support to these studios to combat foreign cartoon producers from Japan, Korea and the US, who dominate 90 per cent of the market.

 France is the most successful animation market in Europe, while feature films dominate in Korea. The industry began by sub-contracting jobs from the US.

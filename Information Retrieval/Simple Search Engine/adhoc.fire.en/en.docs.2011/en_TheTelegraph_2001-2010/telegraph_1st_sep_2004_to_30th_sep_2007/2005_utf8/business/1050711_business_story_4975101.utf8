 Parekh: Customers choice

 Mumbai, July 10: HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh has urged real estate developers to show greater transparency and accountability by extending warranty of two to three years on their projects and pricing their products on the carpet area basis.

 We will support developers who are willing to price their product on the basis of carpet area and provide 2-3 years warranty on their projects. Because all these ultimately benefits the end consumers, Parekh said in his annual letter to the companys shareholders. 

 The housing finance company had earlier announced that it would charge a 0.50 per cent cheaper interest rate to builders who price their housing projects on the basis of carpet area instead of super-built up area.

 We need to look at warranties of two to three years for houses, just like any other product, Parekh said. 

 He argued for the warranty norm as housing is the largest capital investment an average person makes.

 In India we need to focus on the area of governance, transparency and accountability. These are the fundamental issues which will ensure that focus never moves from long-term benefits to short-term gains, Parekh said. 

 Another thing that worries me is that many developers today seek 100 percent up-front payments from their buyers. These payments must be linked to the progress of construction. I hope the building fraternity takes up this issue in the right spirit, he added.

 Parekh also said that advertising and sale of projects prior to finalisation of plans and building approvals is not only unfair to the consumer, but also prevents the healthy growth of the sector in the long term. 

 The emphasis on quality is what projects are based on and the onus of providing the quality must be on the developer, he said.

 The voice of concern comes from the countrys leading housing finance institution, which has over 30 per cent market share in the home loan segment.

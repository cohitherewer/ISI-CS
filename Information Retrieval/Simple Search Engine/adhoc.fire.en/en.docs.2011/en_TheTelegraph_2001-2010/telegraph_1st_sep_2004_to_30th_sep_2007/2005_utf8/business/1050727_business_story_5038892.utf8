 Bharti Tele profit soars 70%

 OUR BUREAU

 July 26: A sizeable increase in subscriber base has helped Bharti Tele-Ventures report a 70 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 504.19 crore during the first quarter ended June 30 compared with Rs 296.12 crore in the year-ago quarter. The company will focus on broadband to generate higher revenue during this fiscal. 

 The company has posted a 48 per cent growth in revenues at Rs 2,524.92 crore against Rs 1,704.16 crore last year.

 Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman and group managing director, said, Operational efficiencies, execution ability and all-India presence have enabled us to break the Rs 500-crore net profit barrier this quarter for the first time. We had entered the $2-billion club last quarter. The companys cash profit for the quarter grew 52 per cent to Rs 926 crore. 

 Bharti Tele has added 13.5 lakh subscribers ? its highest ever in a single quarter ? during the reporting period. With a 21.5 per cent market share, it is the leader in terms of all-India cellular subscriber base.

 However, the companys EBITDA fell marginally to 37.4 per cent from 37.6 per cent in the same period last year. EBITDA is a measure of a companys cash profitability.

 There were regulatory interventions as a result of which access deficit charge came down, which affected the topline. There were changes in the leased-line charges for national long distance calls. Carriage charges were also reduced. So, there was a temporary dip, but we will be back to the normal levels soon, said Akhil Gupta, joint MD and CFO.

 The companys average revenue per user declined from Rs 504 in the fourth quarter of last fiscal to Rs 493 in the April-June quarter. However, Gupta said, Bharti will focus on volumes and net additions than on ARPU or margins.

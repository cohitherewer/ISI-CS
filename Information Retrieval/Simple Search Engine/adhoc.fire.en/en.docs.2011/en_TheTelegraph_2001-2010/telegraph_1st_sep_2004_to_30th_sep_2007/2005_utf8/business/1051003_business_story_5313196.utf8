 Growth cheer spreads, CII sure of 7.3%

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Oct. 2: The economy is likely to clock a 7.3 per cent growth in the current fiscal, says a Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) survey.

 This is largely attributed to strong prospects of kharif production and reasonably buoyant industrial and services sectors, a chamber release said.

 The upward revision in its forecast comes on the back of an 8.1 per cent GDP growth for the first quarter of this fiscal. The report card was released on Friday.

 The minimum support services (MSP) announced by the government for the 2005 kharif season had a positive impact, which resulted in an increase in area under sowing for major crops, the CII said in its latest report on the state of the economy.

 The improved southwest monsoon has also aided the recovery in kharif sowing, leading to improved prospects for 2005-06. Based on these projections, the chamber expects agriculture to grow at 3.2 per cent in the current fiscal, a marked recovery from 1.1 per cent growth recorded in 2004-05.

 The report also points towards a better-than-expected performance of the index of industrial production (IIP), which grew at 9.3 per cent during the April-July period.

 According to the report, a strong rise in non-food credit, capital goods production and imports are supporting a sustained growth in the industrial sector. At the same time, the report warns of emerging constraints reflected by slower output in the core sector.

 The core sector growth was 5.5 per cent for the April-June period compared with 8.1 per cent a year ago. Sectors that are pulling the growth rate down are crude, petroleum products and finished steel.

 The CII expects the rate of inflation to be on the higher side of its 5-5.5 per cent projections because of rising crude oil prices.

 One of the areas of concern is infrastructure, where growth slipped to 5.7 per cent during August compared with 6.3 per cent a year ago. The 16.1 per cent fall in crude output during the month was partly responsible for the dip in growth. However, a double-digit growth in cement and coal sectors helped the six core sectors rebound from a near zero growth in July.

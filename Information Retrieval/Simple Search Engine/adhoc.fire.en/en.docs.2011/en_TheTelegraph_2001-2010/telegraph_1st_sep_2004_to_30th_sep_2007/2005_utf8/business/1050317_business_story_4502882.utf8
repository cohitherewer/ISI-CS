 Rising input cost to put strain on BMW earnings

 Munich, March 16 (Reuters): German premium carmaker BMW forecast roughly stable earnings for 2005 as the weaker dollar and rising raw-material costs exact their toll on group profits despite rising unit sales.

 ?The BMW group in the business year 2005 aims to achieve approximately the high level of earnings of the previous year,? BMW chief executive Helmut Panke told the firm?s annual news conference on Wednesday.

 The guidance is broadly in line with analyst expectations of a 0.5 per cent decline in 2005 pretax profits to 3.54 billion euros ($4.76 billion) from the record 3.55 billion euros posted in 2004.

 BMW shares rose 0.9 per cent to 34.84 euros, outpacing a slight decline in the DJ Stoxx European car sector index.

 ?The guidance is no surprise, since I also expected flat profits for this year,? said Societe Generale analyst Philippe Barrier, who has a ?hold? rating for the stock.

 ?The share price gain is due in part to the strong European car sales data for February,? he continued, referring to BMW?s nearly 24 per cent increase in registrations last month.

 BMW finance chief Stefan Krause warned that the currency impact on earnings this year would be ?far more negative? than what he called a ?low triple-digit-million euro? hit it absorbed in 2004. He was not more specific.

 He reaffirmed that BMW expected higher raw material costs to pressure results with a ?low triple-digit million? euro impact this year following a low double-digit million euro hit in 2004.

 BMW also said it planned to invest around 19 billion euros within the next five years to expand operations. Total capital expenditure amounted to 4.35 billion in 2004, a rise of 2.4 per cent over the previous year.

 ?The expected increase in cash flows over the coming years enables us to invest heavily in the future of the group,? Panke said.

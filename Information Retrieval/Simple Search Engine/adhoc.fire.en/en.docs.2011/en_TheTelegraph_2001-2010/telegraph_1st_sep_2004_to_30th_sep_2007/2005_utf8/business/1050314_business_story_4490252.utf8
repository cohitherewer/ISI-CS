 Export units? clearance scheme on fast track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 13: The fast-track clearance scheme for export-oriented units (EOUs) announced by commerce minister Kamal Nath as part of the new foreign trade policy on October 31, 2004 will now see the light of day with the department of revenue giving its nod on March 4.

 The scheme, which allows EOUs the facility of ?self-sealing containers? and factory stuffing of goods to expedite export of shipments, was announced four months ago.

 However, it remained non-operational as the department of revenue had insisted on certain changes being introduced as the scheme was considered too liberal for a country where tax evasion is common. 

 The fast-track clearance facility is being made available to EOUs having a status-holder certificate under the foreign trade policy. 

 These units will be allowed self-sealing of containers and the facility for factory stuffing of export goods. However, they will have to give ?prior intimation? to the central excise authorities about their plans to undertake the stuffing at their premises.

 Import consignments meant for EOUs will not be subjected to detailed examination at the port of import or inland container depot as these will be examined at the bonded premises of the units. Consignments meant for status-holder units will also not be examined in full even at the bonded premises of 100 per cent EOUs. Request for clearance of rejects in the domestic market will be considered on a priority basis and decisions on such requests will be intimated within seven working days.

 Status-holder EOUs will also be allowed to export samples after intimating the excise authorities and there will be no need to take permission for this. 

 Similarly, they will be permitted to take out their capital goods or parts for repair after intimating the central excise authorities and need not take permission. This facility will be extended to the sale of finished goods in the domestic market.

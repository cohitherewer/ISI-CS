 FII booster for asset companies 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 11: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today followed up its earlier announcement of allowing 49 per cent foreign direct investment in asset reconstruction companies (ARCs) by permitting foreign institutional investors (FIIs) to invest in the security receipts (SRs) issued by these companies.

 The central bank in a notification said FIIs could invest up to 49 per cent in each tranche of security receipt scheme of ARCs, subject to the condition that investment of a single FII in a single tranche would not exceed 10 per cent of the issue size.

 The FII relaxation comes after the government had allowed FDI in the equity capital of RBI-registered ARCs two days ago and it is expected to raise immense interest among overseas investors, though the FIIs are still not permitted to pick up equities in asset reconstruction companies. 

 However, the FII norm (for ARCs) has been relaxed only for a trial-period of one year after which the apex bank will review its stand on the subject. The security receipts of ARCs, in which the FIIs can park in their funds now, are akin to pass through certificates issued in the case of securitisation.

 The ARCs, which buy distressed assets from banks, were set up after the promulgation of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Ordinance. Consequently, many overseas firms, including some big names in the distressed-debt business, evinced interest in buying out stressed assets of Indian banks. Deutsche Bank, Lehman Brothers, GE Capital, Morgan Stanley, Lone Star have reportedly made initial inquiries into the countrys regulations governing the purchase and sale of banks sticky assets and repatriation of funds.

 Of late, foreign banks, such as Standard Chartered, have reportedly evinced interest in buying out non-performing assets of domestic banks and setting up their own ARC arms here.

 Sensex nears familiar peak

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 15: The monsoon is yet to arrive, concerns over economic growth are rising, but investors are still on a high. The buying tempo on the bourses over the past few days continued unabated today, taking the sensex within striking range of the 7,000-mark. 

 The 30-share BSE sensex closed at 6906.98, a three-month high. At one point, the index was on the verge of breaching the all-time peak of 6915.09 touched on March 8, 2005. It had hit an all-time intra-day high of 6954.86 on March 9. Todays close was the highest since March 10, when the index finished at 6907. 

 The rally comes at a time when there are rising concerns about the monsoon and a consequent slow-down of economic growth this fiscal. 

 Earlier, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) had cut its growth forecast for the economy to 6 per cent from 6.6 per cent as it feared that a weak monsoon would hit farm sector output.

 Investors, however, did not heed the CMIE warning. They also ignored concerns over high oil prices and a rising trade deficit. The yawning deficit was one of the factor that led to the rupee closing lower at 43.65 against dollar from its last finish of 43.61. 

 However, the rupees weakness was seen as an opportunity as investors bought technology stocks in the hope that an appreciating dollar would improve the fortunes of software companies.

 France to oppose Danone bid

 Paris, July 20 (AFP): The French government today sent a clear signal that it would oppose any hostile takeover bid by US soft drinks and snack maker PepsiCo for French food and dairy giant Danone.

 Meanwhile, Danone stock, which have risen recently on rumours of a possible bid, gained 6.39 per cent in initial trading here in response to a media report that PepsiCo had appointed two investment banks to advise it on a possible takeover bid.

 French employment and social cohesion minister Jean-Louis Borloo said the government would use whatever means were available to it to do everything possible to try to oppose a hostile takeover bid.

 However, Borloo said his remarks should not be taken as confirmation of what was only a rumour regarding PepsiCo. 

 I can guarantee you that we are watching this matter with external means.

 He said Danone was more than a jewel, it was a special company because it is an emanation of our agricultural production.

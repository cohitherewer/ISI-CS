 Aiyar firm on chasing pipe dream

 New Delhi, March 28: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar is upbeat about both the Myanmar-India pipeline via Bangladesh and the Iran-Pakistan-India pipeline proposals. 

 There has been some forward movement on the proposed India-Myanmar pipeline project following foreign minister Natwar Singhs recent visit to Yangon, Aiyar said today. 

 The minister said the proposal is ?back on track? and he was optimistic about it coming through. 

 Some hard bargaining is still necessary as Myanmar wants to benchmark the price of natural gas to its sales to Thailand which works out to around $4.5 per million British thermal units. This is considered too high by India as even the liquefied natural gas being imported from Qatar is cheaper. 

 Similarly, Bangladesh wants its pound of flesh too. Apart from the transmission fee for the pipeline, it wants India to make way for more imports from Bangladesh to redress the trade balance and also allow transit rights for trade and hydel power imports from Nepal.

 Playing down the US objections to the Iran-India pipeline proposal, Aiyar said, India as a friendly country understands that the US has certain concerns, but the US also understands that we have our views as well.

 Aiyar said he plans to visit Islamabad in May to discuss modalities of the pipeline and other issues of bilateral cooperation in the hydrocarbon sector. ?Pakistan Prime Minister Shauquat Aziz has invited me to Islamabad,? he said.

 The minister will be meeting his Pakistani counterpart to discuss the Iran-India pipeline and diesel and petrochemical exports from India.

 ONGC Videsh

 ONGC-Videsh is looking for opportunities to invest in natural gas exploration in Saudi Arabia, while Hindustan Petroleum Corporation will hold talks with Saudi Aramco for setting up a joint venture refinery in the Gulf nation.

 Aiyar said before leaving for Riyadh today that he would hold talks on setting up a gas-based fertiliser plant in Saudi Arabia on the same lines as the Indian venture in Oman. 

 The minister is being accompanied by OVL managing director R. S. Batola, HPCL chairman M. B. Lal and senior officials of Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Gail and Engineers India Ltd to hold talks with Saudi Arabia on furthering co-operation along the entire hydrocarbon chain. 

 Aiyar will also discuss with Saudi petroleum minister Ali Bin Ibrahim Ali Naimi the ?irrational? skyrocketing of international prices. The minister said the current levels of supply and demand should not be resulting in such huge increases in crude prices.

 Promoters reap stake-trim harvest

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL 

 BOOTY CALL

 Calcutta, Sept. 18: The unrelenting bull-run has prompted promoters, directors and executives to spin some profits from the paper they hold. 

 The stake selling has intensified ever since the sensex crossed the 8000-mark on September 8. 

 Most of the selling has taken place in the small and mid-cap companies, which, analysts say, may be clearly overvalued. 

 Usha S. Shah, promoter of Asian Electronics Ltd, was one of the largest stake sellers among the promoters. She sold 2,90,000 shares in two tranches aggregating to 3.41 per cent stake in the company. The scrip hit its 52-week high on September 16, the day she sold her second tranche. The stock closed at Rs 291.15 on Friday. 

 All the promoters of Gufic Biosciences Ltd, including Gufic Pvt Ltd, Zircon Finance and Leasing Pvt Ltd, Jayesh P. Choksi, Vipula J. Choksi and Pranav J. Choksi, have together sold a 2.48 per cent stake in the company. The selloff would also help promoters abide by the recent Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) rule that requires them to bring down their stake to 75 per cent within the next two years. The promoters stake in Gufic Biosciences stood at 80.21 per cent at the end of June. 

 Firestorm Finance and Trading Ltd, persons acting in concert with the promoters of Hindustan Dorr-Oliver Ltd, has hived off 4.6 per cent of its shareholding in the company in two tranches. The stock closed at Rs 418.7 on Friday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Cracker of a rally for markets

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 31: Equity markets today hit back at proponents of a dark Diwali theory when an across-the-board buying binge sent the sensex soaring 207 points. The fireworks, sparked by firm overseas markets, led to the biggest one-day gain in over a month.

 The pre-Diwali cheer was attributed to the fact that stocks were oversold to the degree that made many stocks appear more attractive than they were at the height of the boom until the early weeks of this month.

 The 30-share index opened at 7717.07, scaled a high of 7905.70 before finishing at 7892.32, up 206.68 points, or 2.69 per cent, from the last close of 7685.64 points.

 Brokers said the primary factor behind the strong opening and the momentum was the trend overseas, where reports of the US economys good shape in its third quarter fired up Dow Jones Industrial Average by over 172 points. Asian indices, like Nikkei, also jived.

 Local operators and domestic mutual funds were believed to have made heavy purchases in key shares that were quoting at values so low they looked like attractive picks. Analysts also believe that after being hammered consistently for much of this month, valuations in some categories of shares have turned promising. This is expected to push institutional investors into stepping up purchases in key stocks.

 The gains in the sensex came after it plummeted 383 points last week, and 949 points this month. The index finished at a life-time high of 8799.96 on October 4, the surge fuelled by a wave of buying from foreign institutional investors (FIIs), the main rally architects.

 Todays bounce also followed disappointing FII numbers for last Friday, when they are believed to have pulled out $60 million from the stock markets. Apart from shrugging off this negative figure, the markets ignored the serial blasts in the capital last week.

 Observers say it will be interesting to see how the FIIs behave in the days ahead, though there are only two days of trading in this week. One of that will be the moorat trading, which will take place between 6.05 pm and 7.20 pm on Tuesday. This will ring in the new samvat year 2063 and brokers will trade on a fresh slate.

 Reliance and Infosys were among the big gainers, as was Hindustan Lever, whose share jumped by Rs 4, or over 2 per cent, to Rs 161.40 after it unwrapped better-than-expected second-quarter numbers. Dr Reddys Labs also got a booster dose, gaining 2 per cent at Rs 807.30.

 All BSE indices finished in the green, indicating that the rally was broad-based. The Consumer Durables Index posted the largest percentage gain of 12 per cent, followed by the IT and the FMCG index.

 Shaky rupee

 The rupee weakened to 45.15 today, driven down by a surge in month-end dollar demand and foreign fund outflows. It was a loss of 6 paise from Fridays finish of 45.09.

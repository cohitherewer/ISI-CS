 Rush call for oil price firefighters

 Going with the flow

 New Delhi, Aug. 12: With global crude prices soaring past the $67-a-barrel mark, the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) has called a meeting of top officials in the petroleum and other ministries on Tuesday to find a way out for the oil companies which are reeling under losses.

 The rise in international prices warrants an increase in retail rates. We are trying to strike a balance between consumers interest, saving oil firms from bankruptcy and keeping the fiscal deficit under control. It is possible that a small burden may be passed on to consumers, petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said.

 While a hike appears to be on the cards, its timing is uncertain. The government, ideally, wants to address the issue once the monsoon session of Parliament was out of its way.

 While the petroleum ministry has forwarded its case for a hike of Rs 3.25 per litre in petrol and Rs 4 in diesel, the government is unlikely to endorse such a sharp increase. 

 Oil companies are also losing Rs 92 per LPG cylinder and Rs 11 per litre on kerosene, whose price has been frozen since March 2002. Cooking gas was made moderately dearer in November last year. It is not for the petroleum minister to decide on the price increase. The decision has to be taken by the cabinet, Aiyar stated.

 The PMO meeting is being seen as an effort to build a consensus before the Cabinet takes a decision. Aiyar said the government would consult its allies and the parties supporting it from outside before making up its mind.

 The petroleum ministry has been arguing that Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and IBP will turn sick if prices are not raised. These firms suffered losses, a rarity of sorts, between April and June.

 A senior petroleum ministry official said the government will have to do a delicate balancing act and opt for a reduction in duties on petroleum products to ease the burden on consumers and oil companies. ONGC, whose profits soar every time crude prices rise, will also be asked to share a larger burden of the oil subsidy. 

 Just how difficult the task is going to be for the government was evident today in the stance of the CPM, which said the burden of rising international crude prices should be shared equally by the government, oil companies and consumers. Though the party leadership came out in favour of a reduction in central levies on petroleum products, its statement seems to suggest it is willing to go along with a mild price hike.

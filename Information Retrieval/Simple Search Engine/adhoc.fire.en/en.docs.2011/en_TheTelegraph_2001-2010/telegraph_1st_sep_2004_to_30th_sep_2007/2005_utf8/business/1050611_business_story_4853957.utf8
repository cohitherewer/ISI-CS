 Citigroup in $2-bn Enron settlement

 FULL CIRCLE

 New York, June 10 (Reuters): Citigroup Inc said on Friday it would pay $2 billion to Enron Corp shareholders, who accused it of helping the energy trader in a massive accounting fraud, a move that cleans up one of the banks top legal problems and could pressure others to settle the case.

 The class-action settlement is the biggest in the long-running Enron debacle and one of the largest in corporate history, though less than the $2.58-billion Citigroup agreed to pay WorldCom Inc investors in 2004.

 Analysts said the agreement with Citigroup, the worlds largest financial services company, could prompt settlements from other banks facing claims for their roles in Enrons December 2001 collapse.

 I think this will force the hand of other big banks like JP Morgan Chase. Usually once one settles, the others follow, said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management in New York.

 Besides JP Morgan Chase and Co, other financial institutions involved include Barclays plc, Credit Suisse First Boston, Merrill Lynch, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto Dominion Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Deutsche Bank AG and the Royal Bank of Scotland.

 Citigroup did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle.

 It said the pre-tax payment was fully covered by its existing litigation reserves, which were boosted to $6.7 billion after the WorldCom settlement.

 The bank does not plan to adjust its remaining reserves and considers them adequate for its exposure to additional pending Enron and investment research-related lawsuits.

 Citigroup chief executive Charles Prince, who took over at the helm of the company in 2003, said it was a key priority for the bank to resolve major cases like this one andto put a difficult chapter in our history behind us.

 By doing so, we will be better positioned to realise our goals, Prince said in a statement.

 Citigroup was told by the US Federal Reserve in March to delay any big takeover plans until the company tightened internal controls and addressed a slew of regulatory problems.

 The settlement with Enron investors needs approval from the banks board of directors, the board of regents of the University of California ? the lead plaintiff for investors in the case ? and a federal court in Houston.

 Tim Woolston, a portfolio manager at Boston Advisors, said the Enron settlement clears up history for Citigroup.

 Prince is able to close a chapter on a less-than-savory period at the bank, and let it go forward. He is clearly in fix-it mode. Obviously, there is more to do, he said.

 Analysts said the settlement was not a market-moving event for the Citigroup stock but was positive as it helps the company move forward.

 In late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Citigroup shares were little changed, up 4 cents at $47.72.

 William Lerach, the lawyer representing the University of California, which lost millions when Enron collapsed, said he was pleased with the settlement.

 Its particularly significant in that several large, similarly situated banks remain as defendants in the case, so this is a step down the road, not the last step on the road, he added. Lerach, who estimates the recoverable damages for Enron investors are in thetens of billions of dollars, declined comment on whether he is in settlement talks with any others. I certainly anticipate that we would see several other large settlements (in the Enron matter in the future), he said, adding that the Citigroup deal came after a series of talks.

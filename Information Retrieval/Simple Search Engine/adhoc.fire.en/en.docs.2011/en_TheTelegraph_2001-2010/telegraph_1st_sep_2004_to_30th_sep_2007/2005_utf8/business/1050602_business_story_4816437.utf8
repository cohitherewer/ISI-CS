 Strides Arcolab to merge with Matrix

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Pep pill

 Mumbai, June 1: Strides Arcolab is merging with Matrix Laboratories in a deal that will spawn the countrys seventh-largest drug company by value. The combined entity, to be called Matrix Strides, will boast Rs 1,000 crore in annual turnover and Rs 170 crore in profits.

 The Bangalore-based Strides makes finished dosages with a big presence in soft gels, while Hyderabads Matrix produces active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). The merger will create a vertically integrated company which straddles the entire value-chain of drugs.

 The merger will be preceded by a valuation exercise and a due diligence. The boards of both companies are expected to meet in six to eight weeks to finalise the terms of the plan. The union will be effective April 1, 2005.

 The Strides-Matrix link-up is part of the recent wave of consolidation in the drugs industry that began in March with the reverse merger of Glenmark Laboratories and TASC Pharmaceuticals. At the heart of the rush is the new product patent regime under which companies that are vertically integrated stand to gain. 

 Consolidation was expected in the industry and it is happening now. Just making pharmaceutical ingredients or a formulation will not suffice. Having an vertically integrated structure is the need of these times as companies look aggressively at the international market, said a pharmaceutical analyst from a leading brokerage.

 After the merger, Matrix Strides will have six API facilities (four approved by US FDA), five intermediate plants and nine (two of them approved by USFDA) formulation sites. It will have a presence in over 70 countries with manufacturing units in India, the US and Latin America.

 The combined entity is expected to make 20 abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) filings by the end of this year. 

 The proposed merger will complement our strengths and helps us emerge as a leader in the global generic space, leveraging Indian innovation and a strong global partnering philosophy, Matrix chief N. Prasad and Strides CEO Arun Kumar said in a joint statement.

 New Delhi, Sept. 20: The telecom subscriber base in the country continued to grow through the second quarter ended June 30 as effective per minute user-charges declined by 37 per cent during the period.

 Both, fixed-line and mobile users grew by about 6 per cent to 104.22 million at the end of June from 98.41 million in March, reported the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India. The year-on-year growth was 26.47 per cent.

 Trais quarterly performance indicators of telecom service report, the first from the regulator, is an attempt to analyse the sector to help analysts, researchers and stakeholders.

 Subscribers of fixed telephone services that includes both fixed-line and wireless-in-local-loop-fixed grew to 46.85 million in the April-June quarter from 46.19 million in March.

 The mobile subscriber base (both GSM and CDMA users) grew 9.86 per cent to 57.37 million in June from 52.22 million in March. On a year-on-year basis, mobile users grew 51.93 per cent, Trai said.

 Another interesting trend was that local call rates on mobile declined to Rs 1.20 per minute from Rs 1.90.

 Launch of recharge coupons has increased the affordability of mobile services and at the same time the service providers are enjoying higher revenue realisation per outgoing minute of about Rs 6.67. This can be seen as a win-win situation. For a customer, monthly subscription to mobile services have become more affordable and for the service provider this will attract new low-usage customers but with higher revenue realisation per minute, Trai said.

 The ratio of users between private and public sector telecom operators has increased to 49:51 from 47:53 at the end of March. In the mobile segment, the ratio remained unchanged at 21:79. The public call offices in the country grew 6.42 per cent to 29.50 lakh during the quarter.

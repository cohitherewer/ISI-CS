 Calcutta, Oct. 21: The American Chamber of Commerce in India plans to open a local chapter in Calcutta provided they obtain at least 15 registrations from American businesses in the region.

 The local chapter in the city can be set up in a couple of months or might take longer depending on the number of registrations we receive, US consul general Henry V. Jardine said on the sidelines of a discussion on Bengal as an emerging investment destination organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.

 Jardine said though there are more than 15 American businesses in the city, a few more are required to obtain the desired number of registrations in the chamber. Such regional chapters are present in Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Tamil Nadu, with the head office in New Delhi.

 The US Consul also plans to set up an American International School in the city and has submitted the proposal to the embassy. We plan to start the school at a primary level with 5 to 10 children as a pilot project and introduce higher levels later, said Jardine. After the proposal is accepted, the operations might start from January 2006, he added.

 Jardine said Bengal is still at crossroads of development where the government efforts to create economic opportunities often faces resistance.

 Progress requires continuous change or it falters and fails. More needs to be done to enhance Bengal as a destination for future investment. More reforms have to be initiated in areas such as investment in retail, agriculture, insurance, banking and infrastructure, he added.

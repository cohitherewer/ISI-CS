 Industrial subsidies face the axe

 Chidambaram: Tough stand 

 New Delhi, Jan. 21: The Congress-led government plans to target industrial subsidies in a big way in the forthcoming budget because they account for a huge indirect dole. Some of them even fall foul of WTO rules. 

 Finance minister P. Chidambaram and plan panel deputy-chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia are believed to have conferred on the issue. A host of tax exemptions will be done away with, while many subsidy schemes will be modified to make them WTO compatible. 

 Officials said the definition of subsidies in the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) strikes down any dole paid out in the form of income or price support or as grants and loans or even as loan guarantees. It also strikes out inadmissible fiscal incentives such as tax credits.

 Officials said this means much of what we are doing now can be deemed as unpermitted subsidy by the WTO. 

 The most obvious subsidy practices which could be thus targeted are grant of cheap loans and loan guarantees to PSUs, the Retention Price Scheme for urea, the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme for the textile sector, the Integrated Leather Development Scheme, the regional development programme for the Northeast, Jammu amp; Kashmir and other states and the supply of natural gas to industry at less than international parity prices. 

 Equity infusion in PSUs is, however, a grey area. Officials said if equity infusion to PSUs is tied up with similar equity offering in that firm to the public or to private industry, then this cannot be struck down by the WTO. 

 The government is also mulling limiting tax subsidies to small-scale firms beyond a certain turnover. It also favours cutting down all tax exemptions based on mere locational advantage ? such as backward areas. This is being done more because it simplifies tax administration than for any other reason. 

 WTO disciplines on other industrial subsidies are, however, relatively benign. The level of subsidies cannot be raised once a tariff commitment has been made. But they can be retained. 

 However, exports benefiting from these subsidies are liable to face countervailing duties if they cause injury to domestic industry in importing countries. 

 ?Generally speaking, the WTO rules on industrial subsidies are not a big constraint on policy making, but following the worldwide phase-out of quotas in textiles and clothing the industrialised countries are not likely to miss any opportunity to put obstacles on imports from India,? officials said. However, industrial subsidies may still be targeted as ?generally these do not make sense as they lead to misallocation of resources.?

 A case can be made for subsidies only if they result in positive externalities as in the case of support for industrial undertakings adopting environmentally sound practices. 

 ?The Integrated Leather Development Scheme could be justified on this basis. A case could also be made for assisting industries in geographically disadvantaged regions, as in the case of the transport subsidies and other schemes for J amp;K and the Northeast region, quot; officials said.

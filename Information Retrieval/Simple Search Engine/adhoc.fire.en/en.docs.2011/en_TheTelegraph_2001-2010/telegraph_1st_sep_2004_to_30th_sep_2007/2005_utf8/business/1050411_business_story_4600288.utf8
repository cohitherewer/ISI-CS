 CII sees trade with China at $20 billion

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 10: Bilateral trade between India and China can swell to $20 billion by 2010 if the export basket diversifies, says the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

 Bilateral trade between the two countries surged to $13.6 billion in 2004 from $7.6 billion in 2003.

 The chamber reckons there should be a special focus on investments and trade in services and knowledge-based sectors ? which are areas of comparative advantage for India. A study conducted on Sino-Indian relations was released by the chamber ahead of the high-profile four-day visit of Chinese premier Wen Jiabao to India.

 The study says Indian companies could enter the Chinese domestic market worth $615 billion by using China as a production base. Moreover, the potential sectors could be identified for investment for short-term, medium-term and long-term returns.

 There is a significant potential for growth in areas like biotechnology, IT and IT-enabled services, health, education, tourism and the financial sector between the two countries.

 There is also an urgent need to shift the focus from primary exports to the export of high value-added products. 

 The study suggests that it is important to conduct market research on the price, pattern, tariffs and source of the imported products by China. 

 ?Setting up branches or representative offices in China to showcase products and liaison with that country?s provincial and central governments and its business community to keep abreast of Chinese policies is imperative,? said the study.

 Another important aspect to showcase Indian products would be to participate in trade fairs in China to display products and material applications and establish one-to-one relationships.

 According to data available, iron ore constitutes about 53 per cent of India?s total exports to China. India is the largest exporter of this commodity to China in value terms. Iron and steel exports have shown a declining trend as they dropped by about 46 per cent over the same period last year.

 New Delhi, Aug. 26: The rate of inflation dropped to a new low of 3.13 per cent for the week-ended August 13 ? its lowest in the last three years ? from 3.35 per cent in the previous week. Rising crude prices, however, pose a major threat to domestic prices. Drop in inflation was due to prudent money supply management by the central bank as well as dip in the prices of manufactured items, minerals and some farm products.

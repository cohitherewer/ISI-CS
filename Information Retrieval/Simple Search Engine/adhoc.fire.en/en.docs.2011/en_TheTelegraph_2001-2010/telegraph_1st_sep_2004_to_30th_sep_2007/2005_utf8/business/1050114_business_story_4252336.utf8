 Calcutta, Jan. 13: Telecom major Bharti has decided to strengthen its corporate business in the city. The company will soon roll out its integrated telecom services for customers in Calcutta. 

 Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman and managing director of the Bharti group, confirmed today that the company has taken a decision to extend its fixed-line services to corporate customers in the city. He, however, did not give any details regarding the investment or the deadline for the launch of the service.

 Deepak Gulati, who is the eastern region CEO of Bharti Tele-Ventures, said, ?We have already started working on the rollout of enterprise business, which is expected to be completed by March. This will enable corporate customers to avail of the entire range of telecom services from a single operator under the AirTel brand.?

 In addition to providing broadband, V-SAT and Internet services, the strategic business unit (SBU) will focus on providing integrated telecom services, including mobile, broadband and telephone, long-distance, and data connectivity services to corporate and institutional customers.

 In June last year, Bharti merged its key corporate account functions of mobility and fixed-line businesses with the broadband and data group ? Bharti Infotel ? to create a new SBU called Enterprise Business. The merger was aimed at facilitating corporate accounts to avail of the mobile services of AirTel, fixed-line Touchtel services and Infotel broadband services through a single business entity.

 TCS poised for top-10 leap

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 19: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) told shareholders at its first-ever annual meeting that it will move up from number 14 to 10 on the global scale by 2010.

 Ratan Tata, the chairman of the company, was missing on the historic occasion. He was in the US, as part of Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs entourage of CEOs.

 Shareholders used the first AGM to demand a generous bonus from a company, which is only a year old in the stock market. It was listed last year, but remains the oldest Indian company in the IT sector.

 Aman Mehta, who chairs the investor affairs panel at TCS, chaired the meeting. Responding to the bonus clamour, he said: We will make a close scrutiny as we move forward. Come on, this is, after all, only our first year.

 The software titan is planning to spend Rs 950 crore on capacity expansion ? Rs 350 crore on technology and Rs 600 crore on building infrastructure to house over 13,500 employees it plans to recruit this year. Out of this number, at least 2,000 will be from other countries.

 Getting to number 10 globally will be a big challenge, given that TCS will be pitted against Infosys, the second-largest infotech firm that is snapping at the heels of the Tata firm. Some of the global big names ahead of TCS are EDS and Accenture. Several analysts are of the opinion that it will be a tough job going past them, too.

 Amid the growth rush, the company said it would soon move to a spanking new corporate office, acquired from Rallis India, a chemicals company within the Tata group.

 When founder F.C. Kohli led TCS in its infancy, the Tatas took a calculated decision to lease out a few floors in the Air-India building in Nariman Point, Mumbais hottest address. Kohli was often known to say in jest that the skyscraper and its location would help TCS impress clients.

 Managing director S. Ramadorai, responding to questions on why TCS was still functioning out of a rented building, said the Ballard Estate office cost Rs 35 crore to renovate.

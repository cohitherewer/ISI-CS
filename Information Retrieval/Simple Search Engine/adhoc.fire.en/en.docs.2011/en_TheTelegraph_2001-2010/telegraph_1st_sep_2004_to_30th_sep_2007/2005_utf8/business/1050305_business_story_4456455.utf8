 Sons to pick up Bajaj reins

 Bajaj: Making way

 New Delhi, March 4: Rahul Bajaj is stepping down as managing director of Bajaj Auto from April 1 and will hand over the baton to his elder son Rajiv.

 ?Rajiv Bajaj will be the new MD,? he told reporters on the sidelines of a business conference here today and added he would continue as chairman of the board.

 On January 1, The Telegraph had broken the story that Bajaj intended to hand over the executive powers to his son in April. ?From April, I will hand over the reins of Bajaj Auto Ltd to my two sons, Rajiv and Sanjiv. Rajiv will become the managing director,? he had said then. He has stuck to his word.

 Rajiv Bajaj is at present the joint managing director. Sanjiv is the executive director. Madhur Bajaj, who is the younger brother of Rahul Bajaj, is the vice-chairman and whole-time director. Rahul Bajaj said he has clearly demarcated the areas of operation between sons Rajiv and Sanjiv.

 Rajiv Bajaj, who is the elder son, will look after marketing, supply-chain management, manufacturing, engineering and product development. For the younger son, Sanjiv Bajaj, the earmarked areas are international marketing, finance and treasury, legal affairs of the company and issues pertaining to the development of human resources.

 Sanjiv will also be entrusted with the task of looking after the corporate governance issues that concern the company.

 Rahul Bajaj has been embroiled in a battle with brother Shishir over disentangling their crossholdings in group companies. 

 Bajaj had said in January that he would step down from the MD?s post only after the squabble with his brother was sorted out. The decision to make the announcement today appears to indicate that the final settlement has been reached.

 Under the terms of the memorandum of understanding that was reached between all members of the family, Shishir will buy out Rahul and his cousin?s stake in Bajaj Hindustan and Bajaj Consumercare. Rahul and the others will, in turn, buy out Shishir?s 5.7 per cent stake in Bajaj Auto.

 Bajaj Auto is the second-biggest motorcycle maker in the country. On Tuesday, it reported that its February sales rose 24.8 per cent to 158,129 units from 126,678 a year ago. The Pune based company had also said sales of motorcycles rose 53.7 per cent to 129,409 units.

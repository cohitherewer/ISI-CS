 Hyundai cuts Xing price by Rs 19000

 Ready for the road

 New Delhi, June 8 (PTI): Hyundai Motors India has launched an offensive by reducing prices of Santro Xing by over Rs 19,000. The company was under pressure from the instant success of Maruti Udyogs Swift. 

 The Korean car manufacturer today rolled out three new variants of the Santro Xing with reduced price tags to take competition to Maruti, which had hiked the prices of Swift by Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 within a fortnight of the launch.

 Hyundai Motors has introduced three new Santro Xing variants ? XK non-AC, XK and XL. 

 While the Santro Xing XK has been priced at Rs 3,26,999 compared with Rs 3.46 earlier, its top-end model, Santro Xing XL, comes with a price tag of Rs 3,45,999, down Rs 16,000. However, the price of the basic XK non-AC model has been increased by Rs 7,794 to Rs 2,78,999.

 Hyundai has a tradition of providing value for money to its customers. Each year we introduce upgraded design and technology in our cars. The launch is another step to offer something new to our customers at affordable prices, said W. S. Win, executive director (sales and marketing), Hyundai Motors India. 

 The new Xing variants will have the latest 1.1 litre engine with ERLX-active intelligence technology. This would give better pick-up, fuel efficiency, lower maintenance and enhanced engine life.

 Industry insiders said carmakers have been feeling the heat following the Swift launch. 

 Maruti Udyog, the countrys largest carmaker, has registered significant bookings for Swift. 

 Cayman S launch

 German car major Porsches sports coupe Cayman S, which will be launched worldwide in November, is likely to hit the Indian roads in January next year.

 Sources in the company said the two-seater sports car would be introduced in India two months after the worldwide launch.

 The delay is due to the homolagation process required to bring the vehicle to the Indian market, they said.

 Targeted at high-end consumers, the sports car has a maximum speed of 275 kilometers per hour. 

 With manual transmission and a centrally placed engine, Porsche claims Cayman S accelerates from zero to 100 km per hour in 5.4 seconds.

 The car is based on the Boxster series with a newly developed six-cylinder 3.4 litres engine having an output of 295 BHP.

 The Cayman S is also expected to go on sale in the United States and Canada at about the same time of its launch in India.

 It is expected to be priced in the US at about $58,900, while the price tag in Canada is estimated to be 83,900 Canadian dollars.

 Porsche has not yet disclosed the expected price of the vehicle in India yet.

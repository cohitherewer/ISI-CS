 Calcutta, May 27: States will have to add value to farm produce by diversifying crops and linking them to the non-farm sector to sustain growth in agriculture.

 It is not possible to achieve a similar or a higher rate of return by just concentrating on foodgrain production, World Bank sector director Sadiq Ahmed said at a session organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce.

 The state has recorded an agricultural growth of 5 per cent during the 80s and 90s and is going strong even now when other Asian countries are facing stagnation.

 However, such growth has now settled to a lower-level plateau. A fresh impetus and better connectivity with rural non-farm sectors is needed to restore the earlier growth momentum, Ahmed said.

 We are eager to provide assistance to the state government. They have sought our co-operation in the health sector, added Ahmed.

 He also said the World Bank team was meeting various state officials, including the secretary of finance and that of commerce and industry.

 The World Bank will also prepare a report on the investment climate of the country, which is likely to begin next year. The project is currently under discussion with the government.

 We had prepared such a report in 2003 in association with the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). We had also prepared a similar report for China, said Ahmed.

 He said those researches show that China has a better investment climate than India.

 According to the earlier report, Bengal lags behind Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in infrastructure and human development because of a lack of investment. Public-private partnership in infrastructure provision may be of help, advised Ahmed.

 The bank is also preparing a report on the employee regulatory issues in the country, which will be available soon.

 For the current year, the banks total investment plan for India is over $5 billion.

 OVL ties up with Kazakh firm

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Tripathi: New ties

 New Delhi, Feb. 19: ONGC-Videsh (OVL) has signed a memorandum of understanding with Kazmunaygas, the national oil and gas company of Kazakhstan, to undertake joint exploration in the Caspian Sea.

 Over the next six months, the two companies will carry out a joint study of existing and potential opportunities for joint activities in the field of exploration and development in the Kazakhstan sector of the Caspian Sea. The pact was signed between the managing directors of the two companies during petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyars visit to Kazakhstan.

 The objective of the study will be to identify a potential project and then conduct a feasibility study on exploration. Negotiations on the main commercial, technical and contractual terms and conditions will follow, based on which the two companies will sign an agreement for the project and OVL will acquire a participating interest. 

 The two countries have also agreed to set up a joint working group on hydrocarbons to look at opportunities for co-operation in the entire value chain of exploration, refining, petrochemicals and pipeline infrastructure.

 Petroleum secretary S. C. Tripathi told reporters that India had changed its strategy in Kazakhstan from a short-term to a long-term one now. ?We are looking at Kazakhstan through an increasing presence in Iran through which we can bring Kazakh oil to the Arabian Sea.? 

 ?We are looking at setting up downstream oil refineries and petrochemical plants in Kazakhstan with the Chinese market in mind. The downstream projects will also be taken up as joint ventures and the petrol, diesel and petrochemicals like paraxylene will be supplied to the huge Chinese market, quot; he added. 

 He explained that energy-rich Kazakhstan had a population of a mere 20 million and, therefore, did not have a big enough market. The crude and petroleum products would, therefore, have to be marketed outside. 

 Tripathi said this was part of the long term hydrocarbon vision envisaged with Kazakhstan and could extend to the next 20 to 25 years. 

 Aiyar is reported to have also stressed on the possibility of developing the north-south transport corridor linking India and Kazakhstan trade into an ?energy corridor? as well. This would enable Kazakhstan to link its oil and gas pipelines to bring energy resources to India and Southeast Asia.

 CALL OF INNOVATION

 Calcutta, Nov. 13: The Indian mobile phone user is moving up the value chain. This is evident from a growing penchant for high-end handsets rich in features.

 The market for such phones is pegged at Rs 225 crore and is expected to grow by 70-80 per cent during the current financial year. The domestic handset market is estimated at Rs 12,000 crore.

 4G Mobiles Retailing amp; Broadband Services chairman Pankaj Mohindroo said, ?Around 1 lakh high-tech devices like ?pocket PCs? and ?smart phones? are sold in India. Though this is quite small when compared with the 25 million units sold annually, the market is definitely growing. Futuristic phones are in demand from enterprise users who frequently travel overseas.?

 Worldwide, futuristic phones comprise 2 per cent of the total 750 million GSM and CDMA handsets sold. The trend is gaining ground in India.

 4G Mobiles has already sold over 5000 units of Microsoft Windows devices valued at Rs 10 crore. ?We are targeting a 15 per cent share of the high-end market in the next 12 months and plan to set up 500 dealers and distributors in major metros and larger towns,? said Mohindroo.

 It has also entered into a marketing tie-up with Dubai-based i-mate, which specialises in Microsoft Windows Mobile devices and applications. i-mate has launched the first mini laptop phone based on the Microsoft Mobile 5.0 version.

 ?The i-mate Jasjar runs on a 520 mhz Intel processor, 128 MB memory, a full VGA screen, built-in antivirus software and Internet telephony software. Users can also benefit from the video conferencing and multimedia with dual cameras, built-in flash and dual loudspeakers for stereo sound. The 180 degrees swivel screen also means that Jasjar can be used either as a PDA in a notebook style or a clamshell mode to be converted to a mini laptop,? said Mohindroo.

 Fitch affirms currency ratings

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 19: Fitch today affirmed Indias foreign and local currency ratings at BB+ with a stable outlook. 

 However, a high fiscal deficit position has prevented the country from achieving an investment-grade rating in the near term, the agency added.

 Despite a solid external liquidity and a declining foreign debt burden, Indias high fiscal deficit prevents it from achieving an investment-grade rating in the near term, Fitch said.

 Future ratings would hinge on the progress made by authorities to improve public finances.

 In essence, Indias weak public finances have become a binding constraint on its sovereign ratings, Shelly Shetty, senior director of Fitchs soverign rating team, said.

 Faster deficit reduction will place public debt on a stronger footing and encourage a virtuous cycle of lower interest rates, greater private investment and higher economic growth, all of which will support a higher sovereign rating, she said.

 The general government debt stock of over 80 per cent of GDP is significantly higher than the BB median and a further build-up in public debt will undermine the ability of the government to respond to shocks.

 With the rapid build-up in forex reserves to $137 billion at the end of 2004-05, India is estimated to have turned into a net external creditor, it said. A strong export growth has placed external debt ratios on a solid downward trajectory.

 However, Shetty said the country is expected to record current account deficits in the coming years.

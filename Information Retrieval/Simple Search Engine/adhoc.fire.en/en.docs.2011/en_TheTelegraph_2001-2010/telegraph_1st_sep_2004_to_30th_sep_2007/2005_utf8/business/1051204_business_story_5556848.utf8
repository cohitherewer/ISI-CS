 Tata Metaliks priority to expansion

 SAMBIT SAHA

 Calcutta, Dec. 3: The Tata Metaliks (TML) board will meet on Monday to decide on the future expansion of the company.

 Tata Metaliks, the largest pig iron manufacturer of the country, is mulling a foray into steel making and setting up a casting unit, too. These new businesses are estimated to cost the company about Rs 1,000 crore.

 When contacted, Harsh K. Jha, managing director of the company, confirmed that the board of directors would meet on December 5 to discuss the expansion plan.

 We are looking at many configurations. There are number of options before the board. Hopefully, we will have a clear picture on Monday, Jha told The Telegraph.

 However, he declined to give further details, including the investment planned.

 At present, Tata Metaliks manufactures only foundry-grade pig iron and wants to get into forward integration to diversify the risk of a single-product business. The expansion is expected to put the company in a different orbit. 

 Tata Metaliks is likely to end this fiscal with a turnover of Rs 500 crore compared with Rs 320 crore last year. With the steel making and casting businesses in place, its turnover is expected to surpass Rs 1,000 crore in 2006-07.

 The steel making facility, which could have a capacity in the range of 0.5-0.8 million tonnes, will produce basic-grade pig iron for making billets (long products). Billets, a semi-finished steel, find applications in the production of structurals and TMT bars used in the construction industry.

 Tata Steel, the promoter of the company, may export the billets to the recently acquired Natsteel facilities across South East Asia. 

 Tata Metaliks, in which Tata Steel holds a 46.6 per cent stake, will channelise a significant share of its current production of 3,20,000 tonnes for castings. The company is eyeing the auto-casting sector more closely for this.

 The expansion will take place in phases given the fact that the estimated investment is twice as high as Tata Metaliks turnover for 2005-06. The new facilities will come up in Kharagpur in Bengal where the companys existing plant is located. Jha said that the land acquisition process was going on with the help of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC).

 However, the availability of water round the year remains a major concern for the company. The nearest river to the plant is Kangsabati, which also feeds farm land in that area. The government has to decided how much water could be allocated to us and to farming, Jha explained.

 Meanwhile, B. Muthuraman, managing director of Tata Steel, has inaugurated a new oxygen plant that has been set up by a US company on build-own-operate basis. The plant will reduce the cost of production and improve productivity. In the near term, the production is expected to go up by 10,000 tonnes a year.

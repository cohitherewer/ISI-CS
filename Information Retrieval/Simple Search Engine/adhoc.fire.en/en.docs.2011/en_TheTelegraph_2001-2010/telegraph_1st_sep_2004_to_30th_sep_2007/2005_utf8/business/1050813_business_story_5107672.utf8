 Tea body lobbies for special fund

 Calcutta, Aug. 12: The Consultative Committee of Planters Association (CCPA), the apex body of Indian tea producers, has moved the Union commerce ministry for creation of a Rs 4,000-crore special purpose fund for the tea industry as promised by the ministry last year.

 Union commerce minister Kamal Nath had announced last year that the fund will be created for replantation and rejuvenation of the tea industry.

 The ministry had appointed SBI Caps to work out a scheme for accessing the fund and utilising it.

 The Tea Board was supposed to co-ordinate the entire thing. We are not aware of the present status and whether SBI Caps is ready with the scheme. But delay in creating the fund is delaying the much-needed replantation exercise required to produce quality tea, said C.K. Dhanuka, chairman of the Indian Tea Association.

 The ITA chairman said tea is one of the major plantation crops in the country and a net export earner. The government is fully aware of the problems of the industry. If we cannot produce quality tea we will lose export markets. Already Sri Lanka and Kenya has made major inroads into the tea consuming countries.

 CCPA has also asked the ministry to share 50 per cent of the social cost that the industry has to bear. An inter-ministerial committee formed by the government had also suggested the government shares the burden.

 The social cost in North India is Rs 7 per kg and in South India its Rs 3.70 per kg. This is a huge burden for the industry which is not getting the price that it should have, the ITA chairman added.

 The industry is also worried about the disbursement of Rs 50 crore, which is lying with the government in the form of additional excise duty (AED). Till March 31, 2005, the industry had paid a duty of Re 1 per kg of tea as AED. The corpus of Rs 50 crore was thus formed. 

 The fund was aimed for generic promotion of Indian tea.

 We have missed one more season. The fund has not been released and the industry could not do anything for generic promotion of tea. This is a major setback at a time when we have to become more competitive and aggressive, Dhanuka said.

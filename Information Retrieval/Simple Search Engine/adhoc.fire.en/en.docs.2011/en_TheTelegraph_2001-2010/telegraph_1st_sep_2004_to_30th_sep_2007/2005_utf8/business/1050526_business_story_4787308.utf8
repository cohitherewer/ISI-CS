 SBI lines up $600m flotation of bonds

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 25: State Bank of India (SBI) is planning to raise around $600 million in bonds to help finance its overseas expansion. The issue, slated to get off the block either next month or in July, is part of a plan announced last year under which the bank intends to mop up $1 billion through medium term notes. 

 The bank borrowed close to $400 million in December last year at attractive rates. Investors lapped up the issue, whose ratings were higher than sovereign grades.

 The fixed rate notes were rated Baa2 by Moodys Investor Service and BB by Standard amp; Poors. These overshot the countrys sovereign rating of Baa3. State Bank is the only bank in Asia to have accomplished the feat.

 The bonds, maturing in five years, were listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange. Such was the investor response to the issue that the order book stood at $1.1 billion. The money was mopped up at 4.847 per cent. This was 117.50 basis points above five-year US treasuries.

 Bank officials had said then that the next round in the issue would be launched in the current financial year, probably after April. The announcement today was made by chairman A. K. Purwar on the sidelines of the International Diamond Conference ? Mines to Market 2005.

 The countrys largest bank, which last week declared its fourth-quarter results, plans to expand its international presence by setting up more offices. At the same time, it is looking to grow through acquisitions.

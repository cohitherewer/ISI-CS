 Calcutta, Dec. 8: Canon India has set a Rs 400-crore turnover target for next year. The company expects to close the current year (Jan-Dec 2005) at Rs 310 crore against Rs 264 crore recorded in 2004.

 The company is betting heavily on digicam, which it expects will contribute to 25 per cent of its total business.

 Digicams contribute to around 15 per cent of the turnover with over 38,000 units sold this year. We expect to sell around 100,000 units next year and expect a turnover of Rs 100 crore from digicams, Canon India vice-president Alok Bharadwaj said.

 The company has bagged the second position with a 20 per cent share of the digicam market. The digicam business has grown by 328 per cent from a market share of 9 per cent last year, he said.

 The domestic digicam market is growing by over 100 per cent with around 225,000 units sold in the current year.

 Regarding the growth strategy, Bharadwaj said the company plans to create demand by aggressive promotional activity that would educate the customer on the product. We have earmarked Rs 20 crore on promotions and plan to localise the awareness content to create a brand appeal across the country, he added.

 Canon plans to take the number of DigiClick Zones to 100 from the current 25 by the end of next year.

 Canon is also upbeat on growth in the eastern region where its enjoys a 32 per cent market share.

 We had a 7 per cent share in the first quarter of the year, but steadily gained ground with focused marketing, brand-building and distribution, said Bharadwaj.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Saregama tunes in to profit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, June 24: Saregama India Limited has turned around and registered a net profit of Rs 5.51 crore in 2004-05 against a loss of Rs 26.16 crore in the previous year.

 In the quarter ended March 31, the company has posted a net profit of Rs 1.22 crore against a loss of Rs 6.62 crore in the corresponding previous period.

 Vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka said Saregama has turned around because of a well-articulated strategy. On the one hand, the company has regained profitability of its core music business, while on the other, it has focused on growing business opportunities in publishing, home-video and digital downloads.

 Saregama has acquired licences from overseas studios Paramount and MGM, in addition to existing ones from Warner and Universal. Home-video sales witnessed a jump of 64 per cent, making a commensurate contribution to profitability.

 Licensing the companys content and working with collection societies at home and abroad in Europe and the US helped publishing revenue increase 48 per cent compared with the previous year.

 The company has been able to strengthen its core music business by de-risking acquisition of new film music by either switching over to the revenue-sharing business model or keeping the minimum guarantee payment low against payment of higher royalty.

 Phillips Carbon Black

 Phillips Carbon Black Limited (PCBL) plans to raise $50 million (Rs 225 crore) to fund its expansion plans.

 The company has informed the Bombay Stock Exchange that the board will meet on June 27 to consider raising funds, which will be required to set up a 40MW cogeneration plant at its Durgapur unit.

 The various instruments that the company may consider include rights, private placement, preferential allotment of shares or debentures, foreign currency convertible bonds and depository receipts.

 The company may also consider tapping international markets for raising funds.

 Goenka said PCBL at present has plants, which produce 18 MW of power. The plant at the companys Baroda unit produces 6 MW of power and the one located at Durgapur produces 12 MW.

 We will set up the 40MW power plant at Durgapur. A portion of the power will be utilised by the Durgapur plant and the rest will be sold to the grid, Goenka added. PCBL produces 2.5 lakh tonnes of carbon black annually.

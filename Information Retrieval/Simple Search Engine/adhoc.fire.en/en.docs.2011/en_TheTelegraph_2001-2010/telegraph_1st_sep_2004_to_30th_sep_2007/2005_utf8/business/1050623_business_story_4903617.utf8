 Dhingra: Looking for opportunities

 Calcutta, June 22: Berger Paints India Limited will set up a facility to manufacture plastic auto parts coatings in technological collaboration with Nippon Bee Chemicals Company Limited of Japan.

 ?The factory will be set up in the country and close to auto manufacturers, preferably in Gurgaon. However, in the rapidly changing business environment, the management will also look at Chennai and the western region as options,? Berger Paints chairman Kuldip Singh Dhingra said.

 ?We are already producing plastic auto parts coatings in collaboration with the company at our existing plants. However, this will be a specialised factory focusing only on this segment,? said Dhingra.

 Dhingra confirmed that Nippon Bee Chemicals will be the licensor of technology and the arrangement between the two companies will be in the nature of co-operation and support from the latter and not involve any equity partnership.

 Nippon Bee Chemicals is a joint venture between Rohm amp; Haas Company Limited of the US and Nippon Paint Company Limited of Japan. 

 ?Although the actual investment for the factory has not been finalised yet, we will finance the total project with our internal accruals,? said Dhingra.

 A few months back, the company had expressed its wish to explore relationships with both global and regional paint companies, both as technological collaborators and equity partners. ?This is not the end. We will continue to examine other opportunities and will take decisions on a case-to-case basis, both at home and abroad,? he said.

 Berger also has other technical licence agreements with DuPont Performance Coatings and Nippon Paint in automotive coatings, Orica Australia for protective coatings and Tigerwerk for specialised powder coatings. The company holds 48.98 per cent in Berger Becker Coatings ? the joint venture firm with Becker Industrial Coatings of Sweden.

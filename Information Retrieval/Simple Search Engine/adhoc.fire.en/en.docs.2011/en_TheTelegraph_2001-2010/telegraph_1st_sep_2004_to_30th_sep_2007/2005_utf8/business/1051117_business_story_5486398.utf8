 NYSE bid to iron out merger wrinkles

 JENNY ANDERSON

 High spirits

 New York, Nov. 16: The New York Stock Exchange reached a settlement on Tuesday with 10 dissident seat holders, or exchange owners, who had sued to halt the exchanges merger with the electronic trading operator Archipelago Holdings.

 Under the agreement, which was hammered out during the second day of a hearing on the dissidents lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court, the two sides will commission an independent valuation of the NYSE-Archipelago deal.

 That analysis will be presented to Judge Charles E. Ramos by next Wednesday. If the judge approves it, the exchange will send it to members at least five days before the previously scheduled December 6 vote on the deal.

 The dissidents, led by a seat holder, William J. Higgins, have argued that the deal ? which will transform the exchange from a nonprofit institution owned by the members to a for-profit entity controlled by shareholders ? was flawed because Goldman Sachs advised both the exchange and Archipelago Holdings.

 According to the terms of the merger, Archipelago shareholders will receive 30 per cent of the company, to be called the NYSE Group, and exchange seat holders will be granted the remaining 70 per cent. Higgins has contended that the seat holders should get a larger percentage.

 This case has been as much about disclosure and the fairness of the process as it has been about the actual terms, said Jim Sabella, a lawyer at Grant amp; Eisenhofer who represented the Higgins camp. Weve always felt they should have independent and up-to-date info and we think this achieves that.

 John A. Thain, the chief executive of the exchange, said, This resolution is in the best interests of our members, the future of the NYSE, and Americas capital markets.

 Archipelago shares have soared since the deal was announced on April 20 and seat prices have risen substantially, indicating the market is receptive to the deal. 

 In a letter to members last week, Marshall N. Carter, chairman of the board, wrote, While Mr. Higgins attempts to make this transaction about Goldman Sachs rather than the future of the NYSE, the simple fact of the matter is that the transaction Goldman Sachs facilitated has resulted in the value of your seats tripling since the beginning of this year.

 Based on the terms of the deal, if Archipelagos stock stays in the range of $48, where it closed on Tuesday, seat holders will receive more than $4 million in cash and NYSE Group shares for their seats. A new analysis of the value of the deal will provide members with another opinion of its worth. Each member can then vote for or against the original terms. The deal is expected to pass overwhelmingly.

 The original deal made all the sense in the world, said Junius W. Peake, a professor of finance at the University of Northern Colorados business school. Theres more than $4 million of value if Arcas stock stays the same and seat prices were under $1 million a year ago. I dont know what Higgins is complaining about.

 During the hearing on Monday, Ramos said he found the sharp rise in Archipelagos stock troubling and asked why a cap on the price, or a collar, had not been considered.

 David Schwimmer, the Goldman Sachs banker who worked on the deal, said the rise was caused by positive anticipation of the merger.

 Ramos pointed to the sharp rise in shares of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which went public in December 2002 at $35 and is now trading at more than $384 and asked, quot;Did that set off any alarm bells?

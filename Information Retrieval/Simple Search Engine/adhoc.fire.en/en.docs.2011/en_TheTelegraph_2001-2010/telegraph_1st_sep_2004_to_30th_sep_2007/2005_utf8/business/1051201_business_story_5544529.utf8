 New Delhi, Nov. 30: AMD and not Intel will be part of the consortium for the first $3-billion semiconductor fabrication unit in India.

 A consortium of AMD, SemIndia Inc and the government will set up the unit as a public-private partnership venture with the Centre providing special infrastructure support to the project.

 Semiconductors are the basic building blocks of telecommunications and are installed as microprocessor chips in electronic equipment.

 Semiconductors help drive our computers, hand-held devices, mobile phones, watches and even cars.

 The government will set up a fabrication city similar to a special economic zone. The exact place is yet to be selected.

 AMD will share the technology, manufacturing and business development licence to meet the growing demand for computers based on x86 microprocessors in India.

 The move is viewed by the industry as a rebuke to Intel ? AMDs competitor ? for having cold shouldered communications minister Dayanidhi Marans offer to set up a fabrication unit in India. Maran had made the offer to Intel while on a visit to the companys headquarters in the US last year. 

 Todays announcement, which comes just one week before the visit of Intel chief Craig Barrett to India, is a big loss to their brand-building in India, said an observer.

 The government is committed to this initiative. We realise that without its support, the fabrication unit cannot take off, Maran said. 

 AMD CEO Hector Ruiz said, It is a transfer of high performance microprocessor logic technology.

 SemIndia board chairman Vinod K. Agarwal, who is bullish on the project, said, The project will be done in multiple steps.

 Calcutta, Jan. 19: Magma Leasing has posted a 57.51 per cent decline in post-tax profit at Rs 3.25 crore for the quarter ended December 31 compared with Rs 7.65 crore in the corresponding previous period.

 Gross income declined 10 per cent to Rs 20.26 crore from Rs 22.46 crore.

 ?Increasing pressure on margins due to intense competition in the financial services sector has resulted in the decline in profit,? said managing director Sanjay Chamria.

 The company writes off bad debts quarterly and not annually on finalisation of the audited accounts, which contributed to the drop in profit.

 However, disbursements have grown 23 per cent to Rs 276.47 crore compared with Rs 224.47 crore in the corresponding previous period.

 ?We had set a disbursement target of Rs 1,352 crore for the current year and indications are we might make that figure. We have to disburse another Rs 500 crore in the last quarter of the year and since 35 per cent of the total volume has been generated in the period, we are hopeful to achieve our target,? Chamria said.

 For the nine months ended December, the company has disbursed 854.93 crore, a growth of 47 per cent over the previous period.

 However, gross income in the nine months increased 9 per cent to Rs 65.81 crore from Rs 60.13 crore in the year-ago period.

 Operating costs have jumped 49 per cent, while interest and financial charges have been cut by 11 per cent.

 The growth in business has come from the commercial vehicles segment, followed by cars and construction equipment. Commercial vehicles constituted 54 per cent of the total disbursement, while cars and construction equipment contributed 24 and 22 per cent, respectively.

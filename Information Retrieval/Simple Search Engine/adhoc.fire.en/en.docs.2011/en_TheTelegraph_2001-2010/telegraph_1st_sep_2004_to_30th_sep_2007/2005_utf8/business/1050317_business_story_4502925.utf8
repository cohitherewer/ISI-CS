 Yes Bank says yes to flotation

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Money matters

 Mumbai, March 16: Yes Bank, the youngest among private sector banks, today filed a red herring prospectus with the market regulator for its maiden offer. 

 The public issue will include 7 crore shares and the pricing will be decided through the book-building route. Merchant bankers say the bank plans to raise around Rs 350 crore through the initial public offering. 

 The pricing will include 25 per cent of the bank?s expanded capital, they added.

 In May last year, the RBI had given Yes Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, the licence to operate as commercial banks. 

 Citigroup?s private equity affiliate holds 10 per cent of Yes Bank?s Rs 200 crore share capital, while AIF Capital, Hong Kong and ChrysCapital, Mauritius have 7.5 per cent each. Indian promoters, including managing director Rana Kapoor, own 52.1 per cent with the remaining 2.5 per cent being held by employees.

 Rabobank Netherlands holds 20 per cent, while Citigroup Venture Capital holds 10 per cent in the bank. ChrysCapital II holds 7.5 per cent and Asia Infrastructure Fund has 7.5 per cent.

 Fifty per cent of the issue will go to qualified institutional buyers (QIBs), 25 per cent to non-institutional bidders, and at least 25 per cent to retail investors. Post-issue, the shareholding of the promoters would be cut to about 40 per cent from 52 per cent. The bank has appointed DSP Merrill Lynch and Enam Financial as lead managers for the offer.

 Merchant bankers say the road shows may open in the latter half of April. 

 The IPO comes at a time when a slew of public sector banks like Punjab National Bank, Dena Bank and Allahabad Bank have raised money through a second offering.

 Oriental Bank has also filed its red herring prospectus with Sebi for another public offering. Bankers are encouraged by the response PNB has received from the primary markets.

 While some banks are raising capital in the local markets, UTI Bank raised a whopping sum of $239.30 million (in excess of Rs 1030 crore) from the global depository receipts market.

 The GDRs will be listed on the London Stock Exchange and was priced at $5.91, which is on a par with the last closing price of Rs 256.65 per share on the NSE yesterday.

 While Yes Bank is one of the youngest banks in the country, its total assets crossed Rs 1,000 crore in February this year. Its advances stand at Rs 567.10 crore and deposits at Rs 298.50 crore, as on December 2004. The banks current capital adequacy ratio is 21 per cent, putting the bank in a very comfortable position to grow. 

 The bank will have 16 branches which will be operational by June-July.

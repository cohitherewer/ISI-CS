 New Delhi, April 18: Reebok India Ltd, the sports footwear and apparel maker, is targeting a sales turnover of Rs 400 crore during this calendar year. Last year, it had notched up a turnover of Rs 250 crore.

 The company, which currently has over 120 stores in India, plans to add nearly 70 outlets by the year-end, said managing director Subhinder Singh Prem.

 Reebok India, which today unveiled its latest advertising campaign featuring Indian cricketers, currently enjoys a market share of nearly 47 per cent in sports footwear and apparel category. It registered a net profit of over Rs 25 crore last year.

 The company plans to expand its presence in Pakistan and Sri Lanka. 

 ?We will add two more stores in Lahore in addition to the one which we opened in February this year. Wasim Akram is our only franchisee in Pakistan. In Sri Lanka, we have had our presence for some time and this year we will add 3 to 5 stores,? said Singh. 

 Reebok is unveiling an ad blitz for which it plans to earmark 10 per cent of its projected turnover of Rs 400 crore. 

 The new ad campaign, which will carry the slogan ?I am what I am? features cricketers Rahul Dravid, Yuvraj Singh, Harbhajan Singh and Irfan Pathan.

 Created by its agency McCann-Erickson, the campaign will first run in print and outdoors. ?We have a couple of months to plan a TV ad for this campaign, but first we will extensively promote it in print and outdoors,? Prasoon Joshi, regional creative director, South-Asia, McCann-Erickson said.

 On its biggest exclusive showroom in Bangalore, Singh said the kids market is a growing area and Reebok will be focusing on this segment.

 ?We opened 5000 sq feet exclusive showroom in Bangalore some days back. We will add one store per week across India through franchisee model with special focus on kids this year,? Singh said.

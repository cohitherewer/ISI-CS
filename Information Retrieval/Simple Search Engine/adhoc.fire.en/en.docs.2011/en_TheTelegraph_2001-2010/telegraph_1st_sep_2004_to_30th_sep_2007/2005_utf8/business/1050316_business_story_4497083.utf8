 Secrecy code for telecom operators

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 15: Telecom service providers who wish to retain the confidentiality of some of the documents they submit to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) will have to say why they want to maintain secrecy.

 The service provider will also have to furnish a non-confidential summary of the portion that they wish to keep confidential.

 The regulator today issued the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Access to Information) Regulation, 2005.

 Any service provider seeking disclosure of confidential information should back up the demand with strong arguments to substantiate that the disclosure will be in larger interest of the public. 

 The request for disclosure should clearly state the purpose and the reasons for which the information is required.

 However, a few categories like trade and commercial secrets and information protected by law; commercially and financially sensitive information, the disclosure of which is likely to cause unfair gain or unfair loss to the service provider; or to compromise the service provider?s competitive position shall be exempt from disclosure under the provisions of the regulation, Trai said in a release.

 Trai will give operators an opportunity to make a representation if the regulator decides to reject the request for confidentiality. A final decision will be taken based on the merits of the representation.

 The rejection shall be communicated to the service provider in writing along with reasons for doing so. 

 The reporting system on Accounting Regulation, 2004 provides for confidentiality of the financial information submitted under various provisions of the regulation. Trai can also call for information under section 12 of the Trai Act from any service provider in relation with its affairs.

 The regulations already issued by Trai does not provide guidance on disclosure of information available with the regulator for which confidentiality has been claimed.

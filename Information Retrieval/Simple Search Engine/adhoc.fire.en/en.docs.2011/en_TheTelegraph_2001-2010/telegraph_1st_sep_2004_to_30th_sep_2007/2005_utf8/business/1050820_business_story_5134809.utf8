 Uco plans to raise Rs 150 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 19: Uco Bank is set to tap the bond market next month to raise Rs 150 crore for its tier II (debt) capital. The bank is also planning to increase its tier I capital (equity) to meet the Basel II norms of 12 per cent capital adequacy ratio (CAR).

 We have decided to raise tier II capital to the tune of about Rs 150 crore by September, said V. Sridar, chairman and managing director of the bank, here today.

 The bank, which had a capital adequacy ratio of 11.25 per cent as on March 31 this year, needs fresh capital infusion in view of the business growth expected this year and to comply with the Basel II norms.

 We are targeting a 30 per cent growth in business to over Rs 1,00,000 crore in 2005-06. As this will lower the capital adequacy, we will need additional capital to maintain the adequacy ratio even at the current level, Sridar said.

 The bank may also look at raising tier I capital. For this, it will seek approvals from the shareholders, the Reserve Bank of India and the Central government. Sridar, however, declined to divulge the amount to be raised as tier I capital.

 Aiyar ayes Mittal deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Aiyar: Go ahead

 New Delhi, July 22: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today allowed ONGC to team up with steel tycoon L.N. Mittal to explore oil buyouts abroad.

 The joint venture, in which ONGC will have a majority stake, will acquire oil and gas fields abroad and explore opportunities in downstream oil refining, petrochemicals and pipelines as well.

 Aiyar had a marathon meeting with ONGC chairman Subir Raha and top officials today. 

 We looked at the draft agreement prepared by ONGC...I dont anticipate any problem, Aiyar said.

 ONGC will sign two sets of agreements with the Mittal group. ONGC-Videsh (OVL) will tie up with the Mittal group to acquire overseas oil equity, while ONGC will sign an MoU to explore opportunities in related businesses like refining, petrochemicals and pipelines.

 ONGC is likely to hold a 51 per cent stake in the joint venture, while the Mittals will own 49 per cent.

 Mittal will be flying in from Frankfurt tomorrow to discuss his foray into the oil business. He will meet Aiyar in the morning to discuss the agreements. Senior company officials will sign the pact and the joint venture will be formally announced at a press conference in the evening. 

 A senior ONGC official said the tieup is expected to give ONGC a stronger foothold in central Asian countries like Kazhakstan where Mittal has a roaring business. 

 ONGC is looking for a stake in Kurmangazy oilfield, and a participating interest in Makhambet and Satpayev exploration blocks. 

 ONGC wants to leverage the Mittal groups influence in oil and gas-rich countries, especially in the Caspian region. Mittal Steel has manufacturing units in 14 countries and sales and marketing offices in another 11 countries. 

 Mittals penchant for clinching deals is expected to help ONGC acquire more oil equity in these countries.

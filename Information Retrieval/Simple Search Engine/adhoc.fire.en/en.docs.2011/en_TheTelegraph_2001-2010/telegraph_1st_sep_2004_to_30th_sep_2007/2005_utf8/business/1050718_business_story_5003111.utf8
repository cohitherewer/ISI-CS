 Paradip port chief

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 Bhubaneswar, July 17: The Orissa government has suggested two names for the post of the chairman of Paradip Port Trust. 

 The post is lying vacant for the last two-and-a-half years after the then chairman Santosh Kumar Mohapatra quit the job. At present, Mohapatra is the CEO of the Dhamara port. 

 Sources said the names of agriculture secretary H.S. Chaahar and Jagadananda Panda, Revenue Divisional Commissioner, Northern Range, were sent to the Centre for its approval. The state government has asked the Centre to pick up either of the two as the chairman of Paradip Port Trust (PPT). Both are IAS officers and have good track records. Both the officers have excellent rapport with the state administration. The state government is keen to appoint an Orissa cadre IAS officer as the PPT chairman. 

 Government circles said after Poscos announcement to set up a Rs 12 million tonnes steel plant at Paradip, the importance of this port has increased.

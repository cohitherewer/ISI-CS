 Q amp;A

 I have taken a home loan from my employer and pay an EMI of Rs 1,970. What will be the rebate amount for calculation of tax liability?

 Amit Kumar Das, Calcutta

 Repayment of housing loan up to Rs 20,000 is eligible for rebate under section 88. However, since your total repayment comes to Rs 23,640, it is advisable to give a break-up of the interest and principal amount and claim the deduction for interest under the head ?income from house property?.

 London calling

 A firm in London wants me to follow up their orders in Calcutta and will pay me on project basis. Under what head shall I include the income?

 A. Chatterjee, by e-mail

 You will have to include it under the head ?income from business or profession? while calculating your total income.

 Joint MIS 

 I have invested in post office MIS Scheme jointly with my wife. Is the interest received included in my total income and thereby taxable?

 Dilip Kumar, Ranchi

 sources?. However, interest income up to Rs 12,000 is 

 eligible for deduction under section 80L.

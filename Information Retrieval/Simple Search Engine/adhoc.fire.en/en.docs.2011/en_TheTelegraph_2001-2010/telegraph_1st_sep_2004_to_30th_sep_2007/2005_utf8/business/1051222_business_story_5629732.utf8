 Sugar firms call for ethanol tie-ups

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Dec. 21: The domestic sugar industry has urged for a permanent ethanol doping programme for transport fuels which will enable sugar mills to enter into long-term agreements with oil companies.

 The scheme of doping of 5 per cent ethanol with petrol, which was supposed to be implemented on a long-term basis, had been suspended midway without justification. Although it has been re-started, the programme should be made permanent as most sugar mills in the country today have huge built-up capacities for ethanol distillation, said Rajshree Pathy, president of Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).

 Pathy cited the example of Brazil where the government had mandated doping of 25 per cent ethanol with petrol. She said India, in contrast, had lagged behind, mainly because of the unwillingness on the part of the oil companies to carry out the programme, though ethanol was first used in the early 1940s due to scarce availability of fuel.

 The scheme of 5 per cent doping was suspended midway because of the perceived shortage of molasses, even though the supply of molasses was adequate, Pathy added.

 Underlining the need to completely deregulate the sugar sector, the ISMA president said the procurement of levy sugar (10 per cent of the total sugar produced by the sugar mills) at prices well below the actual cost of production was unreasonable.

 The government should introduce welfare measures. It was wrong to shift this responsibility to the industry, Pathy said. The ideal system will be for a government agency to purchase sugar from the open market and organise its supplies to consumers below the poverty line. This will help avoiding black marketing.

 Unctad brings FDI home truths

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 29: India is way behind China in FDI inflows to developing countries, according to the World Investment Report released by United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (Unctad) today. 

 Although a more liberal investment regime in India in 2004 led to a 25 per cent growth in FDI inflow to $5.33 billion, it was way behind Chinas figure of over $60 billion, according to the report.

 However, overseas investments by Indian companies were higher at $2.22 billion compared with $1.80 billion infused by Chinese companies in 2004, the report said. 

 According to Unctad, an improved economic situation and a more open FDI climate has encouraged foreign direct investment into the country. The government had raised foreign equity ceilings in aviation services, private banks, non-news publications and petroleum industry in 2004.

 India accounted for the majority of foreign investments in South Asia. Total FDI inflows to South Asia climbed for the fourth consecutive year in 2004 to $7.005 billion compared with $5.331 billion a year ago.

 The Unctad report said improved investment climate and privatisation of assets in Pakistan and Bangladesh have contributed to higher FDI inflows to these countries at $952 million and $460 million, respectively, in 2004. 

 It highlighted the fact that India is increasingly becoming an attractive destination for conducting clinical trials by multinational drug companies. 

 The report estimated that firms could reduce costs by 20-30 per cent if they movetheir research activities to India.

 It said drug firms hire researchers, nurses and IT staff in India at less than a third of wages in the West for conducting clinical trials.

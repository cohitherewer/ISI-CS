 Post-meet cut and thrust

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, April 27: After the battle in the boardroom in the morning, the warring Ambani brothers put out their versions of what transpired in media statements in the evening in which both sides tried to score brownie points off the other.

 The rapier-like exchanges of cut, thrust and parry began with a late evening communique faxed by Anil Ambani?s spokesperson. The release gave a detailed account of Anil?s observations and the objections he raised at the meeting.

 It explained why he abstained from signing the final accounts, the issues he raised relating to shareholder rewards, his demand for an end to the buyback programme, and his objections to the reappointment of H. S. Kohli and appointment of Ashok Misra as an independent director.

 ?Anil abstained from signing the accounts due to the absence of relevant information, details and disclosures for the year ended March 31,? Anil?s spokesperson said.

 Later, the Mukesh Ambani camp came up with its version. ?The details of the annual accounts were provided as is the usual practice to all the directors. The same set of information that has been provided each year was also provided this time,? they said.

 ?However, Anil Ambani sought additional information through a letter delivered at 1 am this morning, much beyond the official working hours. The board has noted the request and the response will be provided in due course,? RIL clarified.

 Anil had apparently raised objections to related party transactions with respect to Reliance Pharmaceuticals and Reliance Nutraceuticals, whose details on ownership, financials and management were not known and in whose favour the effective ownership of a 23 per cent stake in IPCL was transferred by Reliance Capital, which was valued at over Rs 1,500 crore.

 ?It has been clarified that the entire economic benefit of these two companies will accrue to Reliance Industries,? the Mukesh camp riposted. 

 Anil objected to related party transactions with Reliance Infocomm and disposal of plant and machinery of Rs 2000 crore and a rise in contingent liabilities by Rs 1,500 crore and also final accounts of all RIL subsidiaries/affiliates and associates. 

 Anil also proposed that the buyback be closed as the company was apparently not serious about it, having spent only Rs 150 crore or 5 per cent of the approved amount of Rs 3000 crore. The stock price had remained below the maximum buyback price for almost 90 per cent of the time from when the buyback had opened. 

 ?This was destroying credibility of the management,? Anil?s spokesperson said.

 ?RIL has outperformed the sensex by 8 per cent since the buyback announcement. This is in contrast to its underperformance of 5.2 per cent since November 17 until the announcement of the buyback,? Mukesh?s side argued.

 Considering RIL?s strong financials, Anil proposed that shareholders be rewarded with ?much, much higher dividends?, as the dividend yield was too low at 1.5 per cent. 

 Anil also proposed that RIL shareholders be rewarded with a liberal bonus issue which was long overdue. He also felt H. S. Kohli should retire as he was over 70 and it was time to bring in some younger person from within the company. 

 Anil also objected to the appointment of Ashok Misra as an independent director stating that no proper process was followed. 

 ?Anil?s objections and views on all above issues were rejected without any discussions by the RIL board,? lamented Anil?s spokesperson.

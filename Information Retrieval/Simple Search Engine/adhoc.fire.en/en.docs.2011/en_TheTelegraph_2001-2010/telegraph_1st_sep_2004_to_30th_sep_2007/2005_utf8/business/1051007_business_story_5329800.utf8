 Usha Martin bags mine

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 6: Usha Martin, one of the largest wire rope manufacturers in the world, has become the first company to bag an iron ore minefrom the Jharkhand government.

 The company has got a 10-million tonne mine near the Barbill area (Vijaya-II). The ore is high in iron content.

 Usha Martin will save over 50 per cent in raw material costs by using the captive ore. This will help the company on its expansion drive.

 It received the licence, renewable after 20 years, one-and-a-half months ago. The company started operating the mines today. It has outsourced the mining job.

 Within three months, production from the mine will go up to 5,00,000 tonnes to feed the steel plant. The 3,50,000-tonne plant is located in Jamshedpur, about 160 kilometres away from the pit-head.

 In the next two years, the capacity of the steel plant will increase to 500,000 tonnes. In line with this, production from the mine will have to go up to 7,50,000 tonnes.

 The captive ore mine will have a positive impact on the profitability of Usha Martin.

 While firms buy iron ore at a cost of Rs 1,600-2,500 per tonne, depending on the grade, captive mining will ensure Usha Martin gets the raw material at less than Rs 1,000 a tonne.

 The company is also developing a coal mine, which will start production early next fiscal. It will spend Rs 80-90 crore to develop both iron and coal mines.

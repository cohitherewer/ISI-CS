 Scooters India plans to go south

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Sept. 12: Lucknow-based Scooters India Limited, the manufacturer of Vikram brand of three-wheelers, is contemplating to set up assembly lines for its vehicles in southern India to cater to the growing demand for goods carriers in the region. 

 The company is focussing on Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in the first phase for various models of Vikram, said P.K. Dutta, chairman and managing director, Scooters India Ltd. 

 He added that the company would expand to Tamil Nadu and Kerala in the second phase.

 The public sector enterprise has clocked a profit of Rs 2 crore and a turnover of Rs 160 crore last year. 

 It has set a turnover target of Rs 80 crore for the current financial year. 

 Disclosing the companys plan, the chairman said, Last year we manufactured 16,000 units of Vikram and cornered about 95 per cent of the goods carrier market (three-wheelers). The electric version of the vehicle also won applauds of the former US president Bill Clinton when he visited Agra last. 

 In addition to its electric version, Vikram three-wheelers are also available in petrol and diesel as well as in CNG and LPG, both for passenger and cargo movement. 

 Scooters India had wiped out all the accumulated losses after it stopped manufacturing Lambretta scooters (Vijay brand two-wheelers) in 1990 and started making three-wheelers. 

 Scooters India still holds the global rights for the Lambretta technology. The company had introduced Vijay scooters in 1975. 

 This turnaround has helped us come out of the Board for Industrial and Financial Restructuring (BIFR), Dutta said, adding this is a story of a great turnaround and survival.

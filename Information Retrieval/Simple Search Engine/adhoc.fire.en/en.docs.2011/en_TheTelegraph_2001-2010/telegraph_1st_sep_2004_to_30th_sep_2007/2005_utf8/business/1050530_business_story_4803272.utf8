 Maran chases fiscal sops

 Maran: Money talk

 New Delhi, May 29: Communications minister Dayanidhi Maran is likely to seek from the finance ministry additional tax sops for the telecom sector, higher budgetary allocation and a low entry fee or cap for spectrum allocation to operators. The move is designed to provide an impetus to the sector to reach the rural masses fast so as to bring services on a par with urban users.

 At a meeting held last week with senior officials of the department of telecommunication (DoT), the minister had said, In the interest of telecom services and the future potential of the sector, we will have to make compromises. There is a need for continued support, both financial and through policy, if India is to compete with China, he added.

 The communications ministry is in the process of framing guidelines for the allocation of additional spectrum to operators. Spectrum are airwaves on which calls and data travel that we send and receive from our telephones, mobile and Internet.

 While the ministry is yet to decide whether to allocate spectrum through an auction or an entry fee, Maran is keen that it should not be beyond the reach of small operators and, hence, should be priced keeping in mind the interest of telecom services.

 A senior official in the ministry said, We cannot read the mind of the minister. But he has been categorical that whatever decision the department takes should be in the best interest of telecom services in the country and keeping in mind the future role that it will play in the countrys economy.

 As officials, we cannot comment publicly whether frequency should be allocated for a fee or it should be given free of cost. However, operators tend to pass on any additional burden to customers. This is a good enough indication what the cost of the 3G services should be to the end customer, sources said.

 Telecom services have a great potential, we should be careful not to jeopardise what has been achieved and the bright prospects that it offers to rural masses, the minister is understood to have said at the meeting.

 Ministry officials pointed out that any sudden escalation in the cost of telecom services, both simple voice and high-end data services, would have a major impact on the usage pattern of subscribers and addition of new users. Officials also said a new service in rural areas like tele-medicine would lose its relevance if the usage cost is beyond the reach of masses.

 A senior member of the Telecom Commission said there was no disagreement. Spectrum should not be given free. But we need to price it sensibly. It will not be in the range of Rs 1,500 crore per operator. It is difficult to commit how much. It would have to be reasonable, somewhere less than Rs 800 crore, if an entry-fee route is finalised. We are in talks with the defence ministry and will then take it up with the finance ministry.

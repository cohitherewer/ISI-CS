 India Inc ramps up capital spending

 Calcutta, Dec. 11: The corporate sector is on a spending spree ? the splurge being fuelled by improved credit profiles. 

 According to a study conducted by Fitch Ratings India, domestic companies continued to splurge heavily on capital expenditure (capex) during fiscal 2005 on the back of a stronger credit profile. 

 They are investing aggressively to expand capacity across sectors to cater to the growing demand in both the domestic and the export markets, the study points out.

 The capex is being funded by a combination of internal accruals and debt, said Amit Tandon, managing director, Fitch Ratings India.

 Fitch-rated companies in India have definitely seen an increase in borrowings to fund their capital expenditure programmes. After a prolonged stagnation, the capex of these companies has increased by almost 50 per cent over the last one year, he added.

 Though we expected to see the increase from the last fiscal, it did not come about because the companies had adopted a wait-and-watch policy after the surprising election results. When the new government instilled confidence in them, they embarked on expansion plans, explained Tandon.

 The capital-intensive power and infrastructure sectors contributed the bulk of the combined capital expenditure in the current fiscal. The two sectors accounted for 34 per cent and 21 per cent, respectively. However, the biggest rise came from the services, textiles and metals.

 A lions share of this increased capital expenditure was funded through borrowed funds, reflecting the improved credit worthiness of the corporate sector. The proportion of debt in the total capex has increased to 45 per cent during the current fiscal compared with 17 per cent a year ago.

 And the textile sector witnessed the highest growth in percentage of debt at 138 per cent, followed by engineering and offshore drilling with 80 per cent, while telecom and construction in the infrastructure sector saw a 68 per cent growth in debt funding. The share of the metal sector stood at 57 per cent.

 The rise in capital expenditure in these sectors is mostly due to higher borrowings for investments and acquisitions. The auto sector, however, witnessed a decline in borrowings even though there has been an increase in their capex, too. 

 This could be attributed to an increase in foreign direct investment in this sector ? the foreign auto companies expanded their manufacturing capacity in India.

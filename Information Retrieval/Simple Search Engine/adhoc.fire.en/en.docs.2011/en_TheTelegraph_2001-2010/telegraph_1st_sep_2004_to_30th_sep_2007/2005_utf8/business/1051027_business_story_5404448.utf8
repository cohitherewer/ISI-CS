The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Lights burn bright at CESC, net at Rs 57 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Power packed

 Calcutta, Oct. 26: CESC has posted a net profit of Rs 57 crore for the second quarter ended September 30 ? a growth of 9.61 per cent over Rs 52 crore reported in the corresponding previous quarter. 

 The profit before tax was up 21.15 per cent at Rs 63 crore compared with Rs 52 crore in the same period last year. 

 Sales of the company increased 15.66 per cent to Rs 672 crore during the period under review from Rs 581 crore a year ago. 

 Vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka attributed the improved financial performance to higher plant load factor, reduced cost and better sales. This has happened in spite of the decline in average tariff, he said.

 After a long time, the company has registered a 6.5 per cent growth in the industrial consumer category. This has resulted in higher sales, Goenka said.

 However, the power purchase bill of the company has witnessed an 83.33 per cent jump compared with the previous years bill. During the July to September quarter, the power purchase bill stood at Rs 77 crore against Rs 42 crore last year.

 Managing director Sumantra Banerjee said the demand for power is increasing in an exponential manner. So we have to buy more power from the West Bengal State Electricity Board and Power Trading Corporation to meet the growing demand. This has been reflected in our power purchase.

 CESC is planning to set up a 250-mw third unit at Budge Budge at a cost of Rs 1,000 crore to meet the rising demand. The Bengal government has already given the necessary environmental clearance to the project. The RPG-controlled utility is now awaiting the central governments clearance.

 The company has also drawn up plans to set up a 1,000-mw thermal power plant at Haldia. The cost of the project is Rs 4,000 crore and the state government has already allotted a 1,000-acre plot for the project.

 Saregama net zooms

 Saregama registered a 113 per cent jump in net profit at Rs 2.77 crore for the second quarter ended September 30 compared with Rs 1.3 crore in the same period last year.

 Net sales increased to Rs 24.27 crore during the reporting quarter against Rs 23.01 crore in the year-ago period.

 Short-term rates head for a hike

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Reddy: Money matters

 Mumbai, July 20: The Reserve Bank (RBI) is widely expected to raise rates on reverse repos, a financial instrument it uses to soak excess cash from banks, by 25 basis points in the first quarterly review of its monetary policy on July 26.

 Few anticipate the bank rate and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to go up from 6 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively. The RBI lends to commercial banks at the bank rate, while CRR is the rate it pays banks on funds they are forced to keep with the central bank.

 Observers expecting a rise in the reverse repo rate to 5.25 per cent say it is needed because of the current economic conditions and the need to keep the economy from over-heating.

 The economy has been doing well. There has been a huge growth in credit. Under such circumstances, there is no need to keep interest rates low. There is a possibility of the economy over-heating, Sanjeet Singh, head of fixed-income research at ICICI Securities, told The Telegraph.

 While the money markets have largely priced in a reverse repo rate hike, bond yields could go up by 5-10 basis points if RBI governor Y. V. Reddy pushes the move through.

 Those who second this opinion cite inflationary pressures from high oil prices. Reddy himself conceded as much in Chennai recently, when he said global economic uncertainties had deepened beyond his estimates.

 Going by these comments, we can infer that a hike in reverse repo rate is on the cards, an official from one of the leading private sector banks said. The benchmark was last raised in April, by 25 basis points, to 5 per cent against the backdrop of spiralling inflation.

 Siddharth Mathur, a JP Morgan strategist who expects a 25-basis point hike too, agreed it was needed to prevent the economy from growing too fast. The hike should not affect lending rates immediately, but experts say it could set the pace for a rise in bank rate this October. Some feel that it could nudge up home loan rates.

 If I find a mention of excess demand or strong credit growth, rest assured that we could see a bank rate hike in over two months from now, an analyst said.

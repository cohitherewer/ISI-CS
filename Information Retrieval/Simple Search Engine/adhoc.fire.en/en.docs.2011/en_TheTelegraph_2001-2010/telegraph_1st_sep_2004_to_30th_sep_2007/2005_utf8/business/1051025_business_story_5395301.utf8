 Move to ease raw jute supply

 AMIT CHAKRABORTY

 Calcutta, Oct. 24: The government is preparing a de-hoarding drive for raw jute. Lack of availability and an exorbitant price have forced jute mills to reduce operations.

 The office of the jute commissioner has alerted the district magistrates of Bengal to be prepared for the operation once a firm crop data for raw jute for the current jute year ? July 2005-June 2006 ? is worked out.

 Jute commissioner S. Majumdar has convened an emergency meeting of agriculture secretaries of five major jute producing states ? Assam, Bihar, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Bengal ? on Tuesday to take stock of the situation before going ahead with the de-hoarding process.

 Representatives of the industry, Jute Corporation of India and Forward Markets Commission-recognised jute trade associations had also been invited for the meeting.

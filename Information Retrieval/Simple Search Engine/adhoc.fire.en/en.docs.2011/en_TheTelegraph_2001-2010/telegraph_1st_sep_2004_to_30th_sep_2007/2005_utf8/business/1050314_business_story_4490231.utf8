 New tool kit 

 Calcutta, March 13: Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) of Japan will invest about 1.72 billion yen (Rs 71.5 crore) to make its India debut.

 MHI is acquiring an auto component manufacturing unit near Chennai. It will pay 1 billion yen (Rs 41.53 crore) to buy out the local promoters.

 The Japanese company plans to invest another 720 million yen (Rs 30 crore) in the next three years in SRP Tools, a gear-cutting tool maker, to expand its business here, an MHI spokesperson told The Telegraph.

 MHI, which posted sales of 2,373 billion yen last fiscal, is picking up a 92 per cent stake in the local outfit.

 ?This is the first time MHI is directly investing in the country,? the spokesperson added.

 SRP Tools will serve as a local production base of MHI?s machine tool division. The new company will initially produce gear-cutting tools and progressively expand its line-up to include high value-added products.

 MHI has set a target to increase the annual sales of SRP Tools from 500 million yen (Rs 20 76 crore) at present to 2 billion yen in fiscal 2007 (Rs 83 crore) and 4 billion yen (Rs 166 crore) in fiscal 2010.

 A number of international top-notch companies are making a beeline to grab the expanding market here. The recent deals of Holcim-ACC, DHL-Blue Dart and S amp;P-Crisil indicate international majors? growing interest in India.

 The company, which is likely to be called Mitsubishi Heavy Industries India Precision Tools Ltd, will now manufacture precision cutting tools, including hobs, gear shaper cutters, gear shaving cutters and broaches, all of which enjoy a large share in the domestic market.

 SRP Tools facility is located in Ranipet, some 130 kms west of Chennai.

 The new operation will also oversee after-sales service bases in various locations to provide services throughout India in tandem with Voltas Limited, the sole distributor of SRP Tools.

 The new company will have a capital base of approximately 71 million yen. It will absorb about 250 workers now engaged by SRP Tools.

 Kazuyuki Yamashita will head the new venture. MHI will also appoint a chief financial officer.

 The Japanese company plans to expand its Indian market share by introducing Mitsubishis advanced technologies. One such technology is the proprietary SuperDry cutting, which eliminates the need for conventional cutting fluid.

 MHI said the fast-growing auto market in India has created a huge demand for gear cutting tools.

 Automobile production exceeded 1 million units in 2003, and is expected to grow at a robust annual rate of around 15 per cent in the coming years.

 SRP Tools and MHI have been in a technological co-operative relationship for a long time. 

 The companys major customers are motorcycle and automobile manufacturers, including local producers based in Japan and Korea.

 MHI, headquartered in Tokyo, is a leading heavy machinery manufacturer. The company?s diverse line-up of products and services include shipbuilding, steel structures, power plants, chemical plants, steel plants.

 Tata Chem closes UK firm deal

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Menon: Going places

 Mumbai, Dec. 23: Tata Chemicals (TCL) has snapped up a 63.5 per cent stake in Brunner Mond Group, a UK-based soda ash manufacturer, for Rs 508 crore. It has bought the shares from Waylands Investments and Barclays Bank. 

 Brunner Mond makes soda ash and sodium bicarbonate and has manufacturing locations in the Netherlands, UK and Kenya. The acquisition will place TCL among the leading soda ash producers in the world. 

 Commenting on the acquisition, TCL managing director Prasad Menon said from London, This is yet another milestone on our journey towards becoming a globally competitive company. Earlier this year, we became an equal partner in Indo Maroc Phosphore S.A., a company manufacturing phosphoric acid in Morocco.

 The Brunner Mond acquisition will make TCL one of the most diversified companies with manufacturing facilities in three continents and markets across the globe. It will also make the Tata firm one of the most cost-efficient producers of soda ash. 

 According to a company statement, the deal will add over 1,000 employees across Africa and Europe. The total soda ash production capacity of the combined entity will now be close to 3 million tonnes annually. 

 Soda ash is used by the detergents, glass, chemicals, sugar and cement industries. Faced with a rising demand for the commodity from FMCG and glass industries, soda ash prices have firmed up in recent times. 

 While close to 60 per cent of TCLs revenue came from its fertiliser business, soda ash contributed to 20 per cent during the year ended March 31, 2005. The companys sodium tri-polyphosphate and branded salt businesses made up for the remaining 40 per cent. 

 TCLs acquisition of Brunner Mond comes after it opted out of the race to acquire an Egyptian fertiliser company in June this year due to high bid price put by a consortium. Last year, TCL had acquired Hind Lever Chemicals Ltd (HLCL), which manufactures bulk chemicals and phosphatic fertilisers.

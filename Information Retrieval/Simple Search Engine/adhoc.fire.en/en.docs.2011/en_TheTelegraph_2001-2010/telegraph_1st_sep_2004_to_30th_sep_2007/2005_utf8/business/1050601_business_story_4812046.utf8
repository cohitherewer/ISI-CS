 Bangalore, May 31: Alstom Power and Infosys Technologies are jointly setting up a research and development facility here at an investment of $39 million to be made over the next three years. 

 Alstom, the French power equipment major, will fund the R amp;D centre to be set up at the Infosys campus. Software major Infosys will chip in with infrastructure and technical support, including hardware and software. 

 The centre will roll out products and high-end engineering and software solutions for global power plants. 

 It will employ 60 engineers in the first year, which will go up to 300 by 2008. This is Alstoms first joint R amp;D centre with an infotech firm.

 Alstom is planning to make India a major research hub by pumping in 20 per cent of its Euro 600-million R amp;D budget into the country over the next three years.

 For Infosys, this partnership marks a milestone in power engineering. Earlier, the IT bellwether had joint research projects in telecom, aerospace and automation.

 Alstom would strengthen its presence in India by using skills and talents offered by Infosys. Together, we will make products that are more focused on the Indian market. We had evaluated a dozen companies on 40-odd parameters and decided that Infosys was the best partner, said Philippe Joubert, president of Alstom Power.

 The centre will provide Alstom a competitive edge by enabling rapid design and deployment, thus reducing the time-to-market, added Joubert. 

 It would also improve life and efficiency of mechanical components, reduce energy costs, better the performance and cost-effectiveness by using new materials and reduce environmental impact and atmospheric emission of products.

 We will do everything that needs to be done to build products for the local market, said Infosys managing director and CEO Nandan Nilekani. 

 The partnership with Alstom, a leader in turbine technology, will help Infosys create next generation solutions for the power sector, he added.

 By setting up the R amp;D centre, we are not only increasing our presence in India, but also extending our relationship with a vendor like Infosys into high-end partnership, Joubert said. 

 Infosys and Alstom are working together since 2000 with rail transport and technology centre businesses.

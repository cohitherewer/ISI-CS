 Blaze busters 

 - Living in a house that has more than five floors?

 - Make sure the fire safety guidelines have been followed

 Anil Sil cannot forget the night when he had to flee from home after a fire broke out. A short-circuit nearly destroyed his two-storeyed ancestral house.

 He is now moving out of north Calcutta into a new flat in a housing complex. And he is taking care to check what measures the builder is incorporating and what material he is using to prevent the possibility of a fire. 

 Fire safety devices are a feature Sil is insisting on. Fire experts say any building that is over five storeys high should install safety devices. Houses that have less than five storeys need not install devices such as fire alarms or sprinklers but it doesn?t do any harm to have an extinguisher at hand.

 So what are the other features Sil looked for in the complex? First, there should be enough space around each building for fire tenders to move without encumbrance. Preferably, there should be a waterbody in the complex to ensure supply in an emergency.

 At the time of initial inquiry, the prospective buyer of a flat ought to check if fire safety guidelines have been followed. The material used in the building should be non-combustible ? reinforced concrete cement is one such. Wooden doors should be phenol bonded so that they do not add to fire. The electrical wire should be made of flame-retardant material.

 There are a few more safeguards a builder must put in place. Every room should have a smoke alarm. Automatic sprinklers and water sprays should be installed in high-rise buildings. Fire extinguishers are to be kept on each floor. Every building needs an emergency exit plan.

 A thumb rule, irrespective of the shape or size of a building, is to have at least two exits in different parts of the house. 

 Are builders adhering to these norms? Pradeep Chopra, the general secretary of Credai (Bengal), a builders? organisation, said these are essential conditions for any new-age housing. 

 ?We need to get clearance from different authorities before handing over the apartment,? Chopra said.

 However, the responsibility of a builder ends once the house is handed over and the association within the complex or the high-rise committee takes over.

 Maintenance of fire-fighting equipment is the key element in keeping a building secure from fire. 

 ?We have seen that the systems put up by the builder have not worked when a fire broke out a few years after the association took charge of upkeep, simply because they have not been maintained properly. It could be that the extinguisher was past the expiry date and had not been refilled or the water tank was left empty,? Chopra said.

 The only way to tackle this problem is to create awareness, added Anil Kumar, the director-general of Bengal Fire and Emergency Services. ?We do not have the strength to carry out regular inspection. People should be more cautious about fire hazards and take action,? he said.

 There is a provision under which a no-objection certificate has to be acquired from the Fire Brigade before a building can be occupied. 

 Housing associations do not take this clause seriously and the Fire Brigade says it does not have the manpower to check if the safeguards are in place.

 ?We are in the process of appointing a licensed agency that will go and inspect the safety profile. The agency will send us the recommendation and we will take action on its basis,? said Debapriya Biswas, deputy director, Bengal Fire and Emergency Services.

 Still, he insisted that the onus rests on the inhabitants of a building and the housing society. ?We need a mind-set change. One should focus on safety as much as one does on facilities. The inhabitants of a housing complex are the best defence against fire,? Biswas added.

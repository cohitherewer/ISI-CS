 Local arm goes places with Cox buyout

 JAMES HALL 

 Eastward ahoy!

 London, Dec. 18: Cox amp; Kings, the privately owned British travel company founded in 1758 as a transport bureau and bank to the Raj, is to be bought out by the Indian arm of its operations as part of a global restructuring. 

 Cox amp; Kings India will float on the Bombay Stock Exchange early next year. It will then acquire Cox amp; Kingss UK, US and Japanese operations, as well as other global travel businesses, to create Indias first multinational travel company. 

 The transactions will mark the biggest change in Cox amp; Kingss 250-year history and reflect the companys strategy to capitalise on Indias booming economy. The company plans to relocate its head office from London to Mumbai. 

 Peter Kerkar, the chief executive of Cox amp; Kings, which is the oldest travel agency in the world and specialises in upmarket travel packages to the subcontinent, said the company planned to become a global specialist in niche long-haul travel. 

 Cox amp; Kingss UK and Indian arms are separate entities, although Kerkar is the CEO and main shareholder of both companies. His family owns 50 per cent of the UK operation; the rest is held by Anthony Good, the founder of Good Relations, the PR company.

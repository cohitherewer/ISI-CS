 New Delhi, June 16: IndiGo, a little-known Indian start-up airline which is yet to wing its way into the skies, today made history by ordering 100 Airbus A-320s estimated to cost $6 billion or Rs 24,000 crore. 

 This is the largest order in terms of the number of aircraft booked by any Indian airline till date and the second-largest in value terms after Air-India?s order for Boeings valued at $7 billion. 

 ?We hope to launch the airline in about nine months ... we will stagger the arrival of aircraft over a 8-9 year period,? said Rahul Bhatia, managing director of InterGlobe, the travel and hotels firm which has floated IndiGo.

 Bhatia said the airline, which will have a start-up capital of just Rs 350-400 crore, will bring in one A320 a month. 

 ?We will work on a debt equity ratio of 1:6 and increase our equity base when we need to leverage more money to pay Airbus,? he said. 

 Airbus confirmed that IndiGo has ordered 100 aircraft from the A-320 family. 

 The orders were placed by Bhatia?s partner Rakesh Gangwal at the ongoing Paris air show.

 Some eight airlines based in India, including IndiGo, have together committed to buy 320 aircraft for a combined price tag of over $25 billion.

 Jet Airways, Kingfisher Airlines and the yet-to-be-launched Paramount Airways are among them. Low-fare carrier Air Deccan took delivery of the first of its 30 ATR 72-500 aircraft at the show yesterday. 

 Kingfisher has placed orders for 15 Airbus planes, including five of the worlds largest A-380s and as many A-350s, Jet Airways placed orders for 30 aircraft ? 20 boeing 777s and 737-800s and 10 Airbus A330-200/330s ? worth over $4 billion. 

 Paramount has signed a deal for five jets from the Brazil?s Embraer for $138 million.

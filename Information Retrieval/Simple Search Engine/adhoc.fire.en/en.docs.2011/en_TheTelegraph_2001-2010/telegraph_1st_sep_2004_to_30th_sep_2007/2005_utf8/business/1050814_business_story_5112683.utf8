 Parsons faces testing time at Time Warner 

 RICHARD SIKLOS 

 Tough task

 New York, Aug. 13: In his three years running Time Warner, Richard D. Parsons has already faced down tougher challenges than Carl C. Icahn, the former corporate raider who now toils as a corporate crusader. 

 Yet a nascent plan by Icahn to rally shareholders and push for more drastic changes at Time Warner puts Parsons management and political skills to the test, and raises the question of what he should do differently, if anything, to get investors excited about the companys listless stock. Can Parsons solve the puzzle of how to restore investor excitement in not just his own company but an entire industry that is out of favour? 

 More broadly, Icahns cage-rattling has focused attention on a debate over whether Time Warner and other media companies should be spending money to buy back their own shares as a way of boosting their share prices. 

 I think hes incredibly patient and hes a winner, quot; a Sanford Bernstein analyst, Michael Nathanson, said of Parsons. quot;The question we have is ? What is the capital structure of Time Warner into the future? quot; 

 One thing Parsons, Icahn and all of the companys shareholders agree on is that the stock of Time Warner, the worlds biggest media company, has been lacklustre. On May 16, 2002, the day Parsons took the job, Time Warner shares opened at $18.85. They closed Friday at $18.24, after gaining 10.5 per cent since July 25 on reports of Icahns activities. 

 So far, Icahns movements have included buying an undisclosed amount of stock to add to the 5 million shares his Icahn Partners owned. 

 According to people briefed on his plans, Icahn is reaching out to other shareholders to create a coalition of the unhappy that would press Parsons to buy back much of the stock and split off its cable TV unit. 

 He is expected to file a document with the Securities and Exchange Commission discussing his intentions as soon as Monday. According CNBC, Icahn could be seeking to pressurise Time Warner to buy back as much as $20 billion worth of stock ? a far bigger move than its current plan to buy back $5 billion worth. Icahn declined to comment. 

 Some investors view Icahns chances for driving change as scant, given the companys 4.6 billion shares outstanding and $86 billion market valuation. A conventional Icahn power-play, like trying to gain seats on Time Warners board through a proxy fight, may not be feasible. It is also far from clear that Parsons will reject anything Icahn proposes. The company says he is willing to consider anything to create value.

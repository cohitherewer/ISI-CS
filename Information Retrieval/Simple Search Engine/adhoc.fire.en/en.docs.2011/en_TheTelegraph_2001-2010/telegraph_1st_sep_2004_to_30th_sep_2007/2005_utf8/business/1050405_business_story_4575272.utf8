 Sun Pharma pops MJ pill

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 4: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries will acquire the pharmaceutical business of MJ Pharmaceuticals Ltd, including its manufacturing unit at Halol in Gujarat.

 The manufacturing unit will be acquired along with all its assets and liabilities pertaining to the pharmaceutical business, Sun Pharma said. This will be done ?on a going concern basis with effect from March 31, 2005?.

 Sun Pharma picked up a stake in MJ Pharma in 1996. MJ Pharma has a 60,000-sq-m formulations plant with UKMCA approval for sterile dry powder injections, small volume injections, tablets, capsules, liquids and ointments. 

 Recently, lines for soft gelatin caps and aerosols were added. Currently, MJ Pharma functions as a contract-manufacturing site for several companies in India.

 Sun Pharma officials said a major reason for acquiring the pharmaceutical business of MJ Pharma was the new excise duty dispensation. 

 According to the recent changes in excise duty regulations, drug makers will have to pay 16 per cent on less than 35 per cent of the MRP. 

 The move is seen to have removed the sheen off contract manufacturing. 

 According to the new practice, pharmaceutical companies will have to pay an excise duty at the rate of 16 per cent, irrespective of whether the product is manufactured in-house or outsourced. 

 Earlier, drug makers resorted to outsourcing as excise duty was calculated on the cost of production of the contract manufacturer.

 Sun Pharma, which is among the top three players in the therapeutic segments of neurology, psychiatry, cardiology and gastroenteritis, is also present in anti-diabetics, orthopaedics, paediatrics, oncology and ophthalmology. Cardiology, neurology, psychiatry and diabetes constitute a large portion of its domestic formulation turnover.

 The company, which had raised $350 million through convertible bonds, plans to use the proceeds to acquire one or more manufacturing facilities in the US or gain access to segments that were not present in its portfolio.

 Simultaneously, the company is also planning to strengthen its research activities by focussing on new chemical entities (NCE) and novel drug delivery systems (NDDS). In NCEs, one molecule has entered phase I clinical trials in Europe and two NDDS projects are being pursued.

 Food processing units sulk

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 5: The budget has ignored the food processing industry though this sector requires a lot of patronage.

 Speaking to The Telegraph, Parna Dasgupta, secretary, Confederation of Indian Food Trade and Industry (CIFTI) said, ?The ready-to-eat category of processed food requires patronage.While fruit and vegetable-based products are 100 per cent exempt from excise, ready-to-eat items, even those made from fruits and vegetables, attract excise at the peak rate of 16 per cent. So while palaak and paneer (milk products are also exempt, except condensed milk) products would be exempt, a ready-to-eat palaak-paneer will attract 16 per cent excise.? 

 ?Per unit cost of production of processed food in our country is as it is high because of poor infrastructure,? said Dasgupta. ?By dubbing a lot of products as luxury items, we are restricting their usage,? she said. 

 Dasgupta said the only area where food companies will gain are those who use refrigerated vans. This is because of a special 10 per cent excise duty announced for refrigerated vans in the budget, she said.

 ?In India, companies such as Cadbury or Mother Dairy use their own refrigerated vans, which is not the case abroad, where they usually outsource it. Here companies who use their own refrigerated vans, will gain substantially. New outsourcing agencies for such vans may also crop up as business prospects are good, said Dasgupta.

 Meanwhile, cigarettes-to-hotels major ITC has announced its foray into instant snack option with Sunfeast pasta treat an instant pasta with sauce maker. 

 Ravi Naware, divisional chief executive, ITC Limited (foods business), said, ?Consumers today are open to experimenting with their cuisines and looking for options that suit their changing lifestyles.?

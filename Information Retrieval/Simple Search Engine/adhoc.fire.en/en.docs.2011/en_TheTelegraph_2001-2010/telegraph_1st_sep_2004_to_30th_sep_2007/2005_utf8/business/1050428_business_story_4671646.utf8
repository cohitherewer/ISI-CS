 Jute Corp loan writeoff okayed

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, April 27: The cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) today approved the proposal for writing off the entire outstanding loan of the Jute Corporation of India (JCI) amounting to Rs 195.68 crore and Rs 313.97 crore as interest as part of the financial restructuring exercise to breathe new life into the corporation. 

 The CCEA also cleared the provision of a continuous subsidy to JCI from 2003-04 onwards, to offset the losses on its minimum support price (MSP) operations.

 Briefing reporters after the meeting, finance minister P. Chidambaram said the quantum of subsidy will include the difference between the purchase and sale price of jute by JCI. 

 However, while calculating MSP losses, the reimbursement of overhead costs to JCI will not exceed 10 per cent of the value of purchases under MSP in a particular financial year.

 As part of the revival package JCI has been allowed to go ahead with the industrial dearness allowance in pay scales for its employees but will have to meet the expenditure from its own funds, the finance minister said.

 The financial restructuring of JCI is expected to enable it to play an effective role in maintaining MSP and stabilising jute prices through large scale buffer stock operations.

 The CCEA has also cleared a Rs 96-crore proposal of the National Aerospace Laboratories and CSIR for spearheading small civilian aircraft design, development and manufacture under the Saras project. 

 Chidambaram said customs duties for importing materials, components and equipment for the project will be waived.

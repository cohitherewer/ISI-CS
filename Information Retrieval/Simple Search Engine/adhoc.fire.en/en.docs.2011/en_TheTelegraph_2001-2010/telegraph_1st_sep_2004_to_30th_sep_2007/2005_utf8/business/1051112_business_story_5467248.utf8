 Calcutta, Nov. 11: Reserve Bank of India governor Y.V. Reddy today made it clear to banks that customer is the king. Coming down heavily on the current customer-care service, Reddy said the entire system has to be overhauled.

 Addressing bankers at the Banking Conference 2005 here today, Reddy said the RBI would soon put in place a new ombudsman scheme. The new scheme will be funded by the regulator itself so that there is enough transparency while settling grievances of customers.

 Till date the ombudsman scheme is funded by banks. We have observed that if a bank is dissatisfied there it is reviewed at the ombudsman level. But when customers are dissatisfied there is no system of review. The new ombudsman scheme, which will be funded by the RBI, will do away this mismatch, Reddy said.

 He urged banks to review each and every contract that it enters into with customers. It has come to our notice that in some cases interest charges (in case of educational loans) levied by banks according to the contract has been violated. This cannot continue for long, Reddy said.

 The governor added that two Indian banks have garnered nearly Rs 100 crore as penalty from their customers for not maintaining the minimum balance. This indicates that there is no proper communication between the bank and the customer, he said.

 Banks should spell out what are the authorised services it can provide, charges, entry and exit options and compensation due to the breach of contract. 

 Reddy said two weeks back the Gujarat government had issued dos and donts for credit cards. You should not be surprised if other states follow suit, the governor told the bankers present at the meeting. 

 Reddy has also directed his legal department to collate all the decisions of consumer courts on banking and distribute it to banks so that they can act as eye-openers. 

 On regional rural banks, the governor said there are three rural banks in the country, which are performing well and the RBI is thinking of allowing them entry into forex business.

 Second LAF

 The RBI will soon introduce a second liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) to reduce the frictional liquidity mismatch in the monetary system, Reddy said.

 We have to make a distinction between what I may call structural liquidity and frictional liquidity. There are some issues in frictional liquidity and the second LAF will be used on a daily basis to manage it, he said.

 Reddy, however, reaffirmed that there was no problem with structural or long-term liquidity in the banking system.

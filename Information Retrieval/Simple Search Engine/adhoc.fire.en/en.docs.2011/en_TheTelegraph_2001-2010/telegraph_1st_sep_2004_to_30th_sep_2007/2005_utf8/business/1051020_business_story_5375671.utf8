 Huawei move to attract customers

 M. RAJENDRAN

 Beijing, Oct. 19: Huawei Technologies Corporation today opened its inTouch Lab to provide real-time simulation of services and technology to telecom and Internet service providers.

 The inTouch Lab has been set up at a cost of $20 million.

 Touted as the first such initiative by a telecom equipment manufacturer, Huawei feels it will be able to attract more operators as its customers. The company has invested $5 million in the project and the remaining $15 million will be pumped in during the next three years.

 Linda Shuai, director (strategy and marketing application software) at Huawei Technologies, said, We welcome all the service providers to utilise this lab to help lower the time for the launch of a service and the cost based on a real-time experience and not just on a study.

 An operator in India need not come to the lab but can connect the exchange through a dedicated line to our lab with the specifications. The engineers at the lab would help simulate their service and also provide the cost analysis, said Shuai. 

 The inTouch Lab, located at the companys headquarters at Shanghai, has been operational since 2003.

 Haiping Che, president, application and software marketing department, at Huawei, said, We have opened up the lab not only to help our partners but also the end consumers to get better services from the latest technologies like 3G.

 The inTouch Lab partnership plan will provide a series of services for the partners, including an open interface and platforms, development tools, technical support and test environment.

 Che said the introduction of 3G and broadband services have enriched the lives of consumers. Operators, equipment manufacturers, application developers and content providers are beginning to work together to create value-added services.

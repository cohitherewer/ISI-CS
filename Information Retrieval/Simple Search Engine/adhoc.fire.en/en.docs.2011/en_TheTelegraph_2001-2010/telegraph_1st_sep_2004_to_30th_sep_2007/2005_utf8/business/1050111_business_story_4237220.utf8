 Exide net profit jumps 23% in third quarter 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 10: Exide Industries Ltd has reported a 23.19 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 20.93 crore for the third quarter ended December 31 compared with Rs 16.99 crore earned in the corresponding previous quarter.

 Gross sales of the company stood at Rs 367.96 crore, up 27.84 per cent, during the quarter under review against Rs 287.83 crore recorded in the year-ago period.

 Earnings per share stood at Rs 2.9 against Rs 2.4 in the consecutive previous period.

 For the nine-month period ended December, Exide?s net profit increased 14.55 per cent at Rs 59.06 crore compared with Rs 51.56 crore in the year-ago period.

 For the same period, gross sales stood at Rs 1,088.90 crore, up 23.97 per cent against Rs 878.32 crore.

 Cashing in on the booming automotive sales in the company, the original equipment and retail segments of the automotive unit of Exide continued on the growth path. The industrial battery segment, which constitutes 40 per cent of the company?s total revenue, also witnessed growth, particularly in telecom and power segments.

 However, the company is concerned over the rising price of lead in the international commodity market as it constitutes more than 75 per cent of the input cost.

 At an extraordinary general meeting held recently, executive chairman S. B. Ganguly had said on account of the escalating price of lead by over 56 per cent, the profitability of the company might be adversely affected. Hence, Exide will adopt measures at various stages, which will help cut costs by 4-5 per cent.

 For the financial year 2005-06, Exide expects a growth of 18-20 per cent. However, on account of the rising lead prices, the company expects a decline in profitability by 15-16 per cent.

 The shareholders of Exide Industries has approved the private placement of shares of Rs 10 each to Aranda Investments (Mauritius) Pte Ltd at Rs 153 per share.

 The issue will reduce the holdings of the promoting company, Chloride Eastern of Singapore, from 51.46 per cent to 48.87 per cent.

 Post allotment, the combined stake of foreign institutional investors in the company will increase from 1.89 per cent to 6.83 per cent. Total non-promoter shareholding will increase from 28.28 per cent to 31.9 per cent. 

 Aranda will hold 5.04 per cent of the post-preferential allotment equity capital and the stake of the existing FII shareholders will decrease to 1.79 per cent. Total public shareholding, including overseas corporate bodies and others, will be reduced from 20.26 per cent to 19.23 per cent.

 The issue will also increase Exide?s paid-up equity capital from the existing level of Rs 71.22 crore to Rs 75 crore.

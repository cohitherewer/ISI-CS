 loss

 Detroit, April 19: General 

 Motors, facing its worst financial outlook in several years, 

 reported a $1.1-billion first-quarter loss today that it 

 blamed on a stark turnaround in its North American operations. 

 The company also said it was no longer certain enough of 

 its outlook to provide earnings guidance for the full year. 

 ?The results at GM North America 

 were clearly disappointing,? Rick Wagoner, GM chairman and 

 chief executive, said in a statement today. ?We have well 

 thought-out plans to address GMNA?s poor performance, starting 

 with aggressive product introductions this year, value-focused 

 marketing initiatives and further reductions in our cost 

 structure.?

 The loss was in line with GM?s 

 profit warning of last month that sent the firm?s shares 

 to a 12-year low and led to a shakeup of it?s North American 

 management. 

 GM?s $1.1 billion net loss was 

 all the more stark in comparison with a $1.2-billion net 

 profit in the first quarter of 2004. Special items included 

 charges for restructuring the company?s troubled European 

 operations and accelerated retirement packages offered to 

 American white-collar workers. Excluding those and other 

 one-time charges, the company reported operating losses 

 of $839 million, or $1.48 per share, in line with Wall Street 

 estimates, which have been revised downwards since GM executives 

 said on March 16 that the company would fall well short 

 of its initial expectations for the year. Revenue fell 4.3 

 per cent to $45.8 billion in the quarter.

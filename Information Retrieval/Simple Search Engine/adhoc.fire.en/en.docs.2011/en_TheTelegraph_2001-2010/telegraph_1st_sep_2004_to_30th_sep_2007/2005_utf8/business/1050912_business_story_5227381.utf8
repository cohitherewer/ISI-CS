 Mittal drops ore export rider

 Mittal: Deal rush

 Ranchi, Sept. 11: Four days after Tata Steel signed agreements worth Rs 53,000 crore with the state government, an emissary of Mittal Steel flew into Ranchi and agreed to drop the condition of 30 per cent iron ore export for the companys proposed greenfield project in Jharkhand. 

 The Mittals, the worlds largest steel producers, have proposed to invest Rs 40,000 crore for setting up a 10-million-tonne steel plant in Jharkhand. But the ore export clause put forward by the company posed a stumbling block for the project to take off as the state government made it clear that it would not succumb to such a condition. 

 Mittal Steel officials, led by the companys executive vice-president Sudhir Maheshwari, explained the change of stand to chief minister Arjun Munda during their meeting with him in Delhi on Friday and then in Ranchi on Saturday. They also met finance minister Raghubar Das, mines minister Madhu Koda and government officials on Saturday. 

 Mittal Steel delegates claimed the government has assured them of a quick response to their plans. If everything goes well, Mittal Steel chairman Laxmi Niwas Mittal could visit Ranchi in the next three or four weeks to sign a memorandum of understanding with the government.

 We reconfirm and reiterate our strong commitment to set up a steel plant here. We have not withdrawn the proposal. We have even decided to drop the condition of 30 per cent export that was coming on the way. We understand the sensitivity of the issue and the national aspirations, Maheshwari said, before leaving for London on Sunday.

 The government, flush from its successful agreements with the Tatas, said it would definitely support any venture without the export clause. 

 Any investment made on our terms and conditions is welcome. The state government cannot ignore the socio-economic issues while inviting businessmen to set up their bases here, Munda said. 

 Speaking to The Telegraph, mines and geology minister Koda said: They (the Mittals) have communicated their desire to drop the clause. Now we are waiting for their detailed report. We have no problems if they want to do business according to our conditions. We will definitely go ahead in that situation.

 Tata Steel signed four MoUs with the government on September 7 for setting up a 12-million-tonne steel plant, apart from increasing its existing capacity at its Jamshedpur plant. 

 Asked whether Mittal Steels move was a knee-jerk reaction to the Tata Steel deal, Maheshwari said: The decision to drop the export condition has nothing to do with recent development vis-?-vis the Tatas. The government had expressed its reservations on the condition. We were pondering over it for the last few days and had deliberations with key government officials both in Jharkhand and at the Centre. Now we have decided to drop that condition keeping in mind the national aspirations.

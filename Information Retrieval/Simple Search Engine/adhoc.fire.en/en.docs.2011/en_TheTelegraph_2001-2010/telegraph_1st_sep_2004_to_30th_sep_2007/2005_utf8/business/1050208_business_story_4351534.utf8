 Trai ties up proposals on spectrum allocation

 M RAJENDRAN

 New Delhi, Feb. 7: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has finalised the recommendations on allocation of spectrum and is scheduled to send the same to the department of telecommunications (DoT) by the month-end.

 Indications are that the operators utilising the spectrum for high-end services (like downloading movies and songs) may have to pay higher charges, while those providing services exclusively in rural areas may get spectrum free of charge. Spectrum are airwaves on which calls and data travel.

 The government will formulate a policy once it receives the recommendations that will form the basis for future allocation of spectrum to telecom operators.

 DoT sources said it may send a note to Trai to include or give its suggestions on possible spectrum usage in a convergence atmosphere. ?We may soon have a re-look at the convergence bill and the issue of spectrum will have to be revisited. So, a request can be made to the regulator to keep the convergence aspects in focus while suggesting the spectrum allocation,? it added.

 A senior Trai official said, ?We have completed the process of analysing the suggestions from all the stakeholders and the final draft has been approved by the members. Only one last meeting is to be undertaken with the chairman and all members of Trai to discuss the final draft before it goes for print.?

 ?We are yet to receive any request from DoT or any other stake holder regarding the convergence. It may not be possible now, but let them send it and we will decide,? the official said.

 Trai officials said DoT had asked it to only monitor the spectrum use by the operators and the pricing aspects. ?The mandate given to Trai by the act will be followed,? said an official.

 DoT had asked Trai not to breach the mandate by commenting on spectrum that are not yet vacated by the government departments.

 The recommendations on spectrum is eagerly awaited by operators using the code division multiple access (CDMA) technology and global system for mobile communications (GSM) since the issue of controversial PCS 1900 spectrum will be addressed by the regulator.

 Trai, in its consultation paper, had indicated that usage of the North American PCS band (PCS 1900) either in part or in whole, may be considered as a ?possible alternative solution?.

 Operators like Bharti and Hutch have pointed that allocation of the PCS band would block the evolution path of GSM operators to 3G services in the international globally harmonised core band and isolate India from the rest of the world.

 SBC closes AT amp;T buy

 New York, Nov. 19 (Reuters): SBC Communications Inc said on Friday it closed its $16 billion purchase of AT amp;T Corp after California regulators removed the last hurdle and approved the deal.

 The transaction, which creates a communications giant with about $90 billion in annual revenue, was approved by US anti-trust and telecommunications regulators last month.

 Also on Friday California regulators approved Verizons purchase of the No. 2 long-distance provider MCI Inc. That deal, which federal regulators also approved, is expected to close next month or early 2006.

 The companies see the long-distance deals as a way to enter the lucrative market for selling services to large corporate clients and winning large government contracts.

 Fridays deal combines AT amp;T Corp, the No. 1 US long-distance telephone company, and SBC Communications, the second biggest US local phone company after Verizon Communications.

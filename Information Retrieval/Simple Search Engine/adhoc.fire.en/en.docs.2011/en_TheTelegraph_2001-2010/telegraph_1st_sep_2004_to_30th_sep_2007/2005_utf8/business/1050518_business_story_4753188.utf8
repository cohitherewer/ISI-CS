 Mumbai, May 17: Jet Airways has registered a 60 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 133 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31 compared with Rs 82.87 crore posted in the same period previous year.

 The countrys leading domestic carrier entered the exclusive $1-billion club with a revenue of Rs 4,420.17 crore ($1.07 billion) for fiscal 2005, a growth of 24 per cent over the previous fiscal. Net profit for 2004-05 stood at Rs 391.99 crore against Rs 163.11 crore in the previous fiscal.

 Briefing reporters here today, the senior management of Jet Airways led by executive director Saroj Datta and CEO Wolfgang Prock-Schauer said the airline posted strong numbers because of cost-cutting measures. 

 During the current fiscal, Jets strategy would be to sustain leadership in domestic operations and work towards achieving a profitable growth in international operations. 

 The emphasis on sustaining its leadership in domestic operations comes at a time when there are several new entrants trying to grab a slice of the market.

 We endeavour to sustain the high market share. We will do everything to maintain the high product and service qualities, Schauer said.

 The scope for new entrants to make a significant dent is limited, he added.

 To augment its international operations, Jet Airways will start the Chennai-Kuala Lumpur service with daily flights from tomorrow. This will be followed by connecting Mumbai to London with the recently inducted Airbus 340-300 E aircraft from May 23. 

 After this, Mumbai will be connected to New York via Brussels from June 23.

 While talking about the potential international operations hold for the company, Datta estimated that revenues from the Mumbai-Singapore route would be around $22 million, $18 million from the Chennai-Kuala Lumpur service, $75 million from the service to London and around $110 million from New York.

 While admitting that margins in the airline industry are thin, both Datta and Schauer pointed out that there are some advantages of flying international. For instance, fuel, landing and navigation charges are lower compared with the domestic operations. The utilisation of aircraft is also higher at around 15 hours per day against 10 hours per day on the domestic routes.

 Although there was a rise in aircraft fuel expense during the fourth quarter, Jet officials said the airline focused on cost-cutting and better utilisation of its resources. Jet had hired additional personnel during the period.

 During the year, the airline achieved a higher average seat factor of 71.3 per cent, up from 63.9 per cent. Jet flew 8.14 million revenue passengers in 2004-05 and its market share was 43 per cent.

 Sayeed: Help at hand

 New Delhi, Aug. 5: More than 44 per cent households in the country do not have access to electricity, Union power minister P.M. Sayeed informed the Lok Sabha today.

 The government hopes to get quick investments from public and private companies to resolve the distribution and transmission problems and to offer power to all. It has set a target of providing electricity to all households in the next five years.

 Sayeed said the government is taking necessary measures to resolve this and has increased the outlay for the power sector by more than 214 per cent to Rs 1,43,399 crore in the Tenth plan.

 The government plans to supply power on demand by 2012. For this, public investments from the Centre and state governments would have to be stepped up, he said. A sizeable part of the investment should also come from the private sector, he added.

 The minister expressed concerns over the delay in execution of some generation and distribution projects and the related cost overruns. The delay is mainly due to the location of project sites in remote and inhospitable areas. Also, there are problems related to rehabilitation, resettlement and contracts.

 Among the 14 projects, which have been delayed, 11 are hydro and the rest are thermal, Sayeed said. 

 Last week, he had said the power ministry, in discussion with the commerce ministry, will amend a few clause in the foreign direct investment for electricity trading.

 The government has allowed 100 per cent FDI in power trading, but it has to be routed through the foreign investment promotion board.

 Power ministry officials said the new guidelines will be based on parameters and amendments to be made in the existing FDI rules regulation.

 It would be prepared with the assistance of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission. The amendments will seek FDI in power trading through an automatic approval route.

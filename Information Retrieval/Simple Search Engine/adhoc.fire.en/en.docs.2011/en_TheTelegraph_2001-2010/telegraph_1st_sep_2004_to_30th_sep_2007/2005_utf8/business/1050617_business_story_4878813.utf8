 Car majors on warpath

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, June 16: Maruti and Hyundai are headed for a showdown over the Swift and the Santro Xing. Maruti today fired a salvo at Hyundai for misrepresenting facts about the Swift and threatened to take legal action if it did not give a public clarification.

 In a notice served to Hyundai Motors India, Maruti has objected to an advertisement brochure titled Xing ahead of the Swift which is being distributed to customers visiting Hyundai showrooms.

 The advertising brochure makes inaccurate, incomplete and distorted statements in three clear categories ? incorrect drawings comparing the Xing with the Swift, incorrect dimensions of the Swift mentioned in the comparison, incorrect description of the Swift engine and disparaging remarks about the Versa engine, said the notice, which was served by Pallavi Shroff of Amarchand Mangaldas amp; Suresh A Shroff amp; Co.

 Maruti has objected to a particular point in the brochure that says, Why use inferior technology for India? This refers to the engine used by Swift. Maruti has also objected to a statement that claims Swift uses the engine of the Versa, another model from the Maruti.

 The notice adds that the comparison between the two cars is not based on objective, relevant or verifiable material. It is completely misleading because of the false statements about Swift. 

 This is nothing but an attempt to discredit and denigrate our clients (Maruti) product and portray them in a derogatory manner by stating that the Swift is a product of low value or merit. Through your comparison based on false statements, you have tried to ridicule and condemn the Swift, the notice said.

 You have, therefore, disparaged the goods of our client and have committed unfair and restrictive trade practices against them and are accordingly liable in law for this, states the notice.

 The notice has asked Hyundai to issue a clarification in at least two national newspapers within seven days.

 B. V. R. Subbu, president of Hyundai Motor India, said, Yes, apparently they have issued a notice to us this afternoon. We will reply to them whenever it is convenient to do so.

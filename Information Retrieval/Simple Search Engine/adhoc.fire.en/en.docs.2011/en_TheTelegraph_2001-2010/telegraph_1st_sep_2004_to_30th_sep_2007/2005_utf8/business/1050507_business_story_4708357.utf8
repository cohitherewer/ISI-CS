 New Henkel hues in hair care

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Satish Kumar: Adding colour

 Mumbai, May 6: Henkel India today launched twin home-use hair colourants from parent Henkel KgaA?s portfolio. This is Henkel?s first major launch after its corporate restructuring. 

 ?This is a major brand launch after Fa. Hair colourants will give us an entry into this fast growing segment. We will introduce a range of value-added hair products for conditioning and styling in the next few years,? said A. Satish Kumar, managing director of Henkel India.

 Henkel India is using its parent?s experience in Southeast Asian markets to make an impact in India, Satish Kumar said. 

 Schwarzkopf ?Silkience? and ?Pallette?, the two new hair colourants, will help Henkel?s topline grow 12 per cent. 

 Henkel is betting big on this segment as independent estimates reveal that the hair dyes and colourants category in India is worth Rs 270 crore. Of this, the hair colorant segment is around Rs 85 crore and is growing almost 20 per cent annually.

 Silkience and Pallette are priced at Rs 399 and Rs 99, respectively, and will be available at all leading outlets in 20 cities, said general manager Rajeshwari Sheth.

 The company is already present in the colourant segment in the professional hair business, where it has bagged the second spot after L?oreal.

 ?We?ll put our heart and soul into it,? Satish Kumar added. However, he is clear that the company will not make frequent forays into the market with new brands. 

 ?It will be one product at a time as we have to be realistic in what we do looking at our size and scale,? he said. ?We cannot afford to have frequent launches.?

 The company, which follows the calendar year, had managed a small profit after it underwent a major restructuring where it merged some of its subsidiaries.

 At present, Henkel?s sales come from laundry and home-care, which makes up 60 per cent of its sales, while toiletries comprise the rest. 

 The portfolio includes international brands like Henko, Mr White, Pril and Fa, besides strong domestic brands like Margo, Neem Toothpaste, Aramusk, Tuhina and Chek.

 ITC Infotech, PTC in pact 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, June 13: ITC Infotech India Ltd (I3L), a wholly owned subsidiary of ITC Limited, has extended the strategic subcontracting agreement with PTC, the Nasdaq-listed product development software provider.

 The move is significant as it will give ITC Infotech a stronghold in manufacturing and design outsourcing business since PTC, the Massachusetts-based company, has all the major aeronautics and automobile companies as its client.

 The original ITC Infotech-PTC contract was for 39 months starting from July 2003. Now it has been extended up to 2008.

 Under the extended contract, ITC Infotech will continue to provide services to PTC and its global customers for software development and product lifecycle management solutions from its dedicated offshore delivery centre at the ITC Infotechpark in Bangalore. 

 Sanjay Verma, managing director of ITC Infotech said, The success of I3Ls agreement with PTC over the last two years has led us extend the relationship. The new contract offers scope of expanding I3Ls business with PTC and its customers from implementation to a host of other value-added services around PTC products, he added.

 The two companies are planning to explore other auxiliary services like implementation maintenance, support and migration. ITC Infotech also participates in the development of industry-oriented templates for PTC solutions and the development of tools, methodologies and service packaging. 

 We view our partnership with ITC Infotech as a valuable and vital part of PTCs services business, said Barry Cohen, executive vice-president, strategic services and partners, PTC. 

 The possibilities of manufacturing BPO is huge in India. Going forward, companies will outsource design from here and manufacturing from China. With the strategic partnership with PTC, I3L will have a head-start in the design domain, said an expert.

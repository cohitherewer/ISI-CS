 L amp;T sells glass container division

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 26: Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) today completed the sale of its glass container business to ACE Glass Containers of the CK Somani group for an undisclosed sum.

 The divestiture is part of L amp;Ts on-going drive to sharpen focus on its core area ? high technology? and marks the companys pull-out from the packaging business. 

 The glass container unit has been transferred as a going concern to ACE Glass Containers along with employees, whose service conditions will not change under the new owner. 

 The CK Somani Group are the owners of Hindustan National Glass amp; Industries Ltd, the leading manufacture of glass containers in the country.

 The L amp;T division, which began manufacturing flint-glass containers in 1996 at Nasik, has a capacity of 320 tonnes per day. Liquor, soft drinks and food firms are key customers.

 The sale of this business is yet another step since the de-merger of cement unit in 2003 to boost shareholder value by turning the spotlight firmly on engineering amp; construction, high-end manufacturing, electrical amp; electronics, information technology amp; engineering services.

 In May, L amp;T offloaded its 50 per cent stake in the joint venture, L amp;T-Niro, to its Danish partner. The business of building plants for dairy firms was also transferred.

 Chairman amp; managing director A. M. Naik has said several times in the past the company will continue to review its line-up of businesses and quit sub-optimal ones. While the reassessment is under way, efforts will be made to sharpen focus on areas that are enhancing value.

 Last month, L amp;T has signed a $3.6-billion deal with Dubai Aluminium (Dubal) for a bauxite mining and alumina refinery project that will be executed in two phases.

 L amp;T will hold a 26 per cent stake and Dubal the remaining shares in the joint venture that will set up the project.

 The first phase of bauxite mining and alumina refinery project will cost $1.1 billion. The bill for the second phase is estimated at around $2.5 billion.

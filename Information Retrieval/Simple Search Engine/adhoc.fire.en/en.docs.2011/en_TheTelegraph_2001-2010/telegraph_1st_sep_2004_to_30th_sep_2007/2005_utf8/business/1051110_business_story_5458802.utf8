 Serono in talks with suitors 

 Bertarelli: Big bait

 Zurich, Nov. 9 (Reuters): Serono has held talks with four leading drugmakers about a potential $15-billion takeover in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

 Serono, the worlds third-largest biotechnology group, has spoken to Switzerlands Novartis, UK-based GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi-Aventis from France and US drugmaker Pfizer, the newspaper said.

 A spokesman for Serono declined to comment on the article. 

 The report comes a day after the Swiss company said it had hired investment bank Goldman Sachs to explore various strategic alternatives, sending its shares up as markets bet on a premium-priced bid for the firm. 

 The list of companies approached by Serono has been selective, with some likely buyers left out, particularly a group of candidates in the United States, the paper said.

 Still, some of the potential suitors that have spoken with Serono, including Pfizer and Sanofi, are likely to incur too much scrutiny from antitrust authorities to make a deal attractive, the paper added. Sanofi declined to comment on the article, saying its policy was not to react to market rumours.

 Serono is owned 62 per cent by the Bertarelli family and the Geneva-based company is run by chief executive Ernesto Bertarellil. The company has suffered a number of product setbacks earlier.

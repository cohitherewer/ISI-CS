 Tata Power to log out of broadband

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 23: Tata Power may move out of broadband business. The company plans to divest its share in Tata Power Broadband Company in favour of either VSNL or Tata Teleservices. 

 The energy major is concentrating on its core business and has been investing heavily in the power sector. The broadband subsidiary is a non-core segment and so Tata Power is planning to hive it off. 

 In mid-August last year, Tata Power decided to transfer its broadband business on a going concern basis to Tata Power Broadband Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary. 

 Rahul Chaudhry, CEO of the Tata Power Broadband Company, had then said the move to form a subsidiary was in line with the unique nature of the broadband business.

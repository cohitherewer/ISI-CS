 Calcutta, March 29: Housing and Urban Development Corporation Ltd (Hudco) is looking at the external commercial borrowing (ECB) route to raise resources to meet its disbursement plan.

 Hudco chairman and managing director P. S. Rana said it might raise $300 million next financial year. The firm will sanction Rs 12,000 crore for 2005-06, while the disbursement will be Rs 6,000-7,000 crore, he added. Last year, the sanction was Rs 11,000 crore.

 Apart from the ECB route, which has become a preferred mode to draw funds, Hudco will also issue bonds and borrow from lending institutions.

 Regarding the actual disbursement target being far lower than the sanctions, Rana said Hudco was investing in infrastructure projects spread over a period of four to five years. ?The disbursement is made in a staggered manner over a period of time,? he said on the sidelines of a meeting announcing the company?s first joint venture (JV) with the Calcutta-based Pragati Growth and Development Ltd.

 Till February, Hudco sanctioned 15,305 schemes, involving a project cost of Rs 1,15,356 crore with loans of Rs 61,929 crore. A loan amount of Rs 24,129 crore was sanctioned for housing, while Rs 33,639 crore was allocated for the urban infrastructure sector.

 Later on, Hudco plans to involve more private players in various projects. Rana said many such joint ventures were on the anvil. ?There could be many project-specific joint ventures. We have received many offers. We are evaluating them. There is no limit to the number of JVs that can be worked out by Hudco,? he added.

 Policy review

 The Centre has set up a task force to review the National Housing and Habitat Policy, 1998, to make it people and industry-friendly, Kumari Selja, minister for state (independent charge) urban employment and poverty alleviation, said.

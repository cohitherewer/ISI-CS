 Eveready plans to raise funds abroad

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Aug. 18: Eveready Industries India Limited (EIIL) will either float a $30-million (Rs 135 crore) GDR issue or come up with foreign currency convertible bonds to finance its expansion and acquisition plans. 

 The board will meet on August 26 to finalise the fund-raising exercise.

 The companys decision to raise funds in the foreign markets has impacted its share price, which shot up by 13.66 per cent on the bourses today.

 In a notice to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the company said its board would consider issuing convertible warrants on a private placement basis, foreign currency convertible bonds, global depository receipts and/or other equity-linked securities in foreign currency.

 Executive vice-chairman and managing director Deepak Khaitan said, The issue size has not yet been finalised but it will be in the region of $30 million.

 ICICI Securities has been given the mandate to manage the fund-raising exercise.

 The funds raised will be used to part finance the companys new manufacturing unit at Uttaranchal, retire its high-cost debts and prepare a war chest for acquisition of brands.

 Eveready is setting up a manufacturing unit for dry cell battery in Uttaranchal at a cost of Rs 60 crore. The new unit will have a capacity of 400 million batteries annually.

 Regarding brand acquisitions, Khaitan said, It may be in our core business ? battery and tea ? or may be an unrelated area. We always had plans to add some new products in our distribution chain. It may be an international brand or a domestic one. 

 After the board clears the fund-raising programme, we will appoint a merchant banker for finding out a suitable brand for us.

 Eveready had posted a net profit of Rs 6.29 crore for the quarter ended June 30 compared with a loss of Rs 4.43 crore suffered during the corresponding period last year. 

 The net sales of the company for the quarter was Rs 188.29 crore, an increase of 8 per cent from Rs 173.59 crore achieved during the same period in the previous year.

 The profit before tax was Rs 11.13 crore against a loss of Rs 5.06 crore in the year-ago period.

 Rising prices to hurt oil firms? earnings

 S. P. S. PANNU

 New Delhi, March 7: With the price of the Indian basket of crude imports crossing $42 per barrel in February, the downstream oil companies ? Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum ? do not appear to be in a position to improve their financial performance during the last quarter of the current financial year.

 Given the continuing upswing in international prices of crude, the government will come under increasing pressure to raise domestic prices of petroleum products. The oil companies have seen their profits plummet in the third quarter (October to December) as the political compulsions of the government have prevented them from going in for a price increase.

 The oil companies expect to lose Rs 400 crore on petrol and diesel sales during March because of changes in the tax structure introduced in the new budget, even though finance minister P. Chidmabaram has claimed that the exercise was ?revenue-neutral?.

 While Indian Oil expects to lose Rs 225 crore, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum anticipate a loss of around Rs 90 crore each in March. This will add to the heavy burden that the oil companies are facing because of the sale of domestic LPG and kerosene at below the market price.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar will approach the cabinet on the issue as the ministry feels that there is no escape from an increase in prices with the public sector oil companies coming under increasing financial strain. 

 Official statistics accessed by The Telegraph show that the price of the Indian crude basket had come down to $38.81 per barrel in November and dipped further to $36.85 per barrel in December after having touched an all-time high of $43.38 per barrel in October, 2004. However, the crude prices resumed their upward march in January this year when the average price of the Indian basket of crude imports rose $40.99 per barrel and then shot up to $42.18 during February.

 The Indian basket comprises 55 per cent of the relatively cheaper Dubai crude, which has a higher sulphur content, and 45 per cent of the more expensive sweet crude, which is benchmarked with the Brent variety of the UK.

 EU dumps draft

 Hong Kong, Dec. 17 (PTI): The European Union, blamed by many as being largely responsible for the impasse in global trade talks, today came out strongly against the draft ministerial text, saying the statement lacked balance and did not match its expectations.

 Europe believes there are problems with the draft text. It lacks balance and is not what we hoped for. We believe it can be improved and we will continue to negotiate, EU trade commissioner Peter Mandelson said, reacting to the draft ministerial text released today.

 Conceding that the trade block would be under pressure on eliminating export subsidies, Mandelson said, We will defend our interests. We are here to do business but our negotiating partners will have to engage and show flexibility.

 The EU is under immense pressure from developing nations including India, Brazil as also rich countries, particularly the US, to agree on 2010 as the end date for elimination of export subsidies. This date has been written in brackets, implying that it has not been finalised.

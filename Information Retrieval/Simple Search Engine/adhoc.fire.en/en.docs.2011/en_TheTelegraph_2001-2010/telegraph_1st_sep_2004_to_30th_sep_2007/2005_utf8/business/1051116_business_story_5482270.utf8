 States to steer recast of minor ports 

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 HARBOUR OF HOPE

 New Delhi, Nov. 15: The shipping ministry is in favour of granting greater freedom to states for the all-round development of minor ports that do not receive central funds. 

 The Centre is keen on extending financial support to minor ports. However, it is cash-strapped as the emphasis is on developing the 12 major ports, which handle almost 75 per cent of the traffic. 

 The shipping ministry has asked the maritime states along the 7,500-km Indian coastline to set up maritime boards to make them eligible for central assistance.

 According to sources, the issue was discussed at a high-level meeting where shipping secretary D.T. Joseph is said to have recommended that the control of minor ports should be handed over to their states. 

 Unlike the major ports, which are run entirely by the central government, the minor ports fall in the jurisdiction of states. But the Centre has a say in the development of these ports because of the financial support it extends to these projects and the need for technical expertise.

 There are around 185 minor ports that dot the country?s coastline, of which 80 are notified customs ports. Most of these are located on the western coast in Gujarat and Maharashtra. Kulpi appears to be the only small port listed in Bengal. 

 The shipping ministry proposes to implement new schemes in major ports for addition of 122 million tonnes of capacity. This requires an estimated investment of Rs 16,000 crore in major ports. Capacity addition of about 50 million tonnes is proposed through development of minor ports and building captive port facilities by the user industries.

 There are several instances where the user industry has developed small ports in their area of operations, such as Dahej in Gujarat by public sector oil companies and Dabhol in Maharashtra. The government is keen to promote this concept further. 

 Partnerships between major port trusts and minor ports is yet another route envisaged by the government to promote the development of minor ports. This is expected to provide experienced management and better technical facilities at the small ports. 

 Of Rs 16,000 crore required for expansion of major ports, a sum of Rs 8000 crore is expected from public funds such as government budgetary support (Rs 2000 crore), internal resources of ports (Rs 5000 crore) and borrowings by the port trusts (Rs 1000 crore). 

 To cover the shortfall, ports have been thrown open for private sector participation and proposals to the tune of Rs 4,000 crore have already been cleared, which includes foreign direct investment.

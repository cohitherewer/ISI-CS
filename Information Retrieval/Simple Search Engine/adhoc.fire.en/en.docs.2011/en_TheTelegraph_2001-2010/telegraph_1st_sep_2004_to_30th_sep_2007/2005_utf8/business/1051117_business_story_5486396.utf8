 Liberty to leave News Corp alone

 Adelaide, Nov. 16 (Reuters): John Malones Liberty Media Corp was unlikely to try to take over News Corp, News chairman Rupert Murdoch said on Wednesday, but News Corp would keep its poison pill in place just in case.

 Murdoch also said News Corp was very unlikely to make a bid for publisher Knight Ridder Inc, which said this week that it would explore a possible sale of the company, bowing to demands from two large investors unhappy with its depressed stock price.

 Murdoch defended the companys decision to extend a poison pill provision to block a hostile takeover by Liberty, and said it would remain in place as long as there was any chance of such a move by Malone.

 I dont think there is any chance of it. We have a very good relationship, Murdoch told reporters after his first shareholder briefing in Australia after moving the companys corporate domicile to the United States a year ago.

 The last thing John has is the management to run this company or the appetite to have most of our assets. But we think the idea of someone getting control or undue influence over the company without paying a proper premium for it is wrong for all other shareholders.

 A group of shareholders has launched a legal action against the poison pill extension arguing that the company promised it would not extend the provision without seeking shareholder approval.

 Theyre wrong. It was not a promise. We were very careful about it. And we said so at the time that we were very careful, that this was a policy we had, Murdoch said.

 Murdoch, 74, was in Adelaide to officially open News Ltds new building, named after his father, Keith, who founded the newspaper empire.

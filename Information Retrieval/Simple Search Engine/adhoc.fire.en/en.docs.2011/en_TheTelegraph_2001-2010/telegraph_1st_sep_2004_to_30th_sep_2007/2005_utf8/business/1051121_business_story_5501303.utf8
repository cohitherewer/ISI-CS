 IBM to Power ahead on HCL Tech prowess

 Chip IN WITH MORE

 New Delhi, Nov. 20: IBM will piggyback on HCL technologies to expand its market share in critical components used in automobiles, wireless and consumer electronic devices as part of its worldwide strategy code-named Power Everywhere. 

 IBM has inked a long-term agreement with HCL to hawk products jointly developed on IBMs microprocessor cores-PowerPC405 and 440.

 These are core designs developed on IBMs Power architecture, which is used in computers. HCL engineers will work on these designs to develop specific products for telecom equipment makers, consumer electronic customers and automobile manufacturers. HCL Tech will have to take permission and assistance from IBM to develop these specialised products at a design centre located in Chennai. 

 The intellectual property right (IPR) for the core design will rest with IBM. It is a 20-year old design owned by IBM and anyone who uses it has to pay a licence fee as also a royalty for new products developed and sold in the market. 

 The product IPR will be owned by the customer, while HCL Tech will own an IPR for the design input. 

 We will take the Power architecture core of IBM and build a system chip. We will also design an integrated board with software and sell it as one product. The buyer can be a HCL customer or IBM can also recommend customers. It is a partnership, Divakar Maddipatla, corporate vice-president and head (semi conductor practice) at HCL Technologies, told The Telegraph.

 Their (IBM) motivation is to get a market share, he added.

 For every new product HCL designs on IBM Power architecture, it will get a fee and IBM will get the licence fee. Subsequently, when customers buy the product, both HCL and IBM will get a royalty, Divakar said. It took us one year to convince IBM about our design capabilities and get the deal, he added.

 This is not the first design centre set up by a US infotech company in India. Credence and Synopsis already have such centres here. 

 However, Divakar claims that these are HCLs own design centres and not franchised to any Indian IT company. He said it is a major deal, since IBM has, for the first time, accredited a design centre, which it does not own.

 HCL Tech has a dedicated team of 25 senior software engineers and sales executives working on the IBM products.

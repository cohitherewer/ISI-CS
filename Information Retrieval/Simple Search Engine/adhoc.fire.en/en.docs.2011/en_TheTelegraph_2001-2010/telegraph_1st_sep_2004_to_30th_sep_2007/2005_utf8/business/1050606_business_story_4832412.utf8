 Supply travails stalk polyester yarn makers 

 VIVEK NAIR

 Mumbai, June 5: The abolition of the quota regime has turned into a boon for textile manufacturers in the domestic market ? except the players in the polyester filament yarn (PFY) sector. In its wake, this change has brought them difficulties as enhanced capacities have created an oversupply situation affecting the margins.

 These capacities were added not only by leading producers but also by small and medium-sized companies which wanted to grab the opportunities thrown up the dismantling of the three-decade-old quota regime. 

 According to an official of Century Enka, a BK Birla group company, many small and medium sized plants added 1.51 lakh tonnes to their PFY capacities in 2004-05. This is 13 per cent of the industry capacity.

 The Rs 955-crore company has, in its annual report, pointed out that this trend changed the situation from balanced supply-demand position to excess supply. This has led to stiff competition among PFY producers. 

 Century Enka has recently commissioned its polyester yarn expansion project, which will increase its capacity to 81,000 tonnes from 37,900 tonnes. For the current financial year, the company is concerned about the volatility in the raw material prices and supply-demand mismatch in case of polyester yarn. The margins are likely to remain under pressure, the company stated. 

 India produces over 11 lakh tonnes of polyester yarn annually with Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) having a mammoth presence in the sector. 

 The last fiscal saw a spurt in the prices of key raw materials such as purified terephthalate acid (PTA) and mono ethylene glycol (MEG) due to high crude oil prices.

 Initially, the polyester yarn makers were successful in passing on this increase in costs to its customers, but it could be done only partially now. The pressure on polyester yarn prices can be seen from the fact that Reliance has brought down its yarn prices by over 8 per cent to Rs 67 per kg in June from Rs 73 per kg in May.

 A market insider who tracks the industry noted that prices were likely to fall over the next two months. Besides, the demand for yarns and raw materials were low from China, which also had pulled down the international prices, he said.

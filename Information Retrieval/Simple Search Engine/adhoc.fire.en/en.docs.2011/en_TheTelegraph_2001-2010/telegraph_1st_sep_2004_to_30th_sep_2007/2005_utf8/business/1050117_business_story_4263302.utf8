 Penalty for tea fakes 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Weeded out

 Calcutta, Jan. 16: The Tea Board of India has drawn up a detailed plan to penalise those who misuse the provisions of the Geographical Indication (GI) Act for Darjeeling tea. 

 Darjeeling tea received GI registration recently.

 According to the penalty measures worked out by the board, anybody involved in violating the GI Act may face an imprisonment from three to seven years and may be fined as well. The fine for GI offences is not less than Rs 50,000 and may go up to Rs 2 lakh.

 For the second and every subsequent conviction under the GI law, the imprisonment for a term will not be less than one year and up to three years and fine not less than Rs 1 lakh and up to Rs 2 lakh.

 Worldwide, 40 million kgs of Darjeeling tea are found even though only 10 million kgs are produced in India. Spurious Darjeeling tea, masquerading as original, is destroying its image.

 Tea Board chairman N. K. Das said falsifying and falsely applying GIs is a cognisable offence under the GI and copyright laws. The Darjeeling logo is registered as an artistic work under the Copyright Act, 1957. GI registration is owned and registered by the Tea Board. It can be used only by authorised users registered under the GI Act.

 Das said the board has already taken steps to protect Darjeeling tea abroad. ?We have registered the certification trade mark of Darjeeling tea in the US, the UK and Australia. If anybody violates these, the GI Act allows us to take penalty measures against them,? the board chairman said.

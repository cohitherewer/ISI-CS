 India on global drug supply chain map

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, May 24: India is emerging as an integral part of the global supply chain for pharmaceuticals, says a report prepared by Ernst amp; Young.

 Any discussion on the global pharmaceutical supply chain can now no longer ignore Indias relevance. India is becoming an integral part of the pharmaceutical value chain, said E amp;Ys third annual report on Global Trends in the Pharmaceutical Marketplace.

 Large global pharmaceutical companies will continue to increase their sourcing of active pharma ingredients, offshoring of clinical trial and development and partnering with domestic companies for new product development and marketing in India. Over the long term, India is bound to have a larger impact on the tax and tariff structure of the pharma industry, the regulatory and IT environment beyond the obvious impact on its innovation and manufacturing, said Utkarsh Palnitkar, health sciences industry practice leader at Ernst amp; Young India.

 The report said Indian drug firms would hold a competitive advantage in the new product patent regime and collaborations between local and global partners would offer Indian companies an opportunity to tap global research networks and gain access to new technologies, while providing a platform to global drug majors to leverage the scientific talent available in India. 

 The partnering theme in Indian pharma industry is reaching a new crescendo. Illustrating this trend are some landmark deals ? Glenmark with Forest Labs of the US and more recently with Teijin Pharma of Japan; the R amp;D tie-up between Torrent and AstraZenecas; the contract research deal between Novartis and Syngene, and Nicholas Piramals flurry of in-licensing deals with several global biotech majors, said Palnitkar.

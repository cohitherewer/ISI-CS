 Skoda clears way for Combi

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 3: Skoda Auto India is planning to roll out its much-talked about premium station wagon Skoda Combi later this year.

 Sources say the Combi will be larger than the Indigo Marina and Corsa Swing, the other two station wagons from the stable of Volkswagens Indian subsidiary. Combi will be launched both in diesel and turbo-petrol variants with a price tag between Rs 13 lakh and Rs 16 lakh. 

 Its long-awaited small car, Fabia, may also hit the Indian roads during the later half of next year along with the new Skoda Octavia, manufactured on a bigger platform. 

 The Indian debut of Skoda Fabia was due last year, but the company delayed the rollout due to production constraints.

 According to company sources, the management is also evaluating the launch of other cars from Skodas global portfolio to take on rivals in India. 

 Skoda Auto India caters to the premium car market in India with 10 models, including Skoda L amp;K, Skoda Superb and SkodaRS.

 The company last month announced the rollout of a 20-valve turbo version of its recently launched Octavia Rider, fitted with a 1.8-litre turbo petrol engine. The car is priced at Rs 11,03,369 (ex-showroom Delhi).

 The carmaker is targeting a sales growth of 30 per cent this year. To achieve this, the company plans to be present in every passenger-car segment. It would also double the production capacity at its Aurangabad manufacturing facility to 30,000 units. The expansion programme is likely to be completed by the year-end.

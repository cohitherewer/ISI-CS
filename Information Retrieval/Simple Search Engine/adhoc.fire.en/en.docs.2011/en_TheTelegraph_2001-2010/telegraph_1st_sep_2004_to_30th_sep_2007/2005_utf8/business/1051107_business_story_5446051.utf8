 Catch-up race on Asian trade highway

 S.P.S. PANNU 

 Chiang Rai (Thailand-Laos-Myanmar border), Nov. 6 : While India struggles to kick-off trade ties with neighbours like Bangladesh, China is forging ahead with regional trade as new international highways are coming up to strengthen its links with Thailand, Myanmar, Laos and even former enemy Vietnam. 

 The upgradation of road-links is part of an Asian Development Bank-sponsored scheme for developing the region situated along the Mekong river that flows across these five countries. 

 The greater Mekong subregion development programme has 19 ongoing projects worth $5.2 billion, of which ADB is giving $1.5 billion. Another 100 technical projects are being implemented at a cost of $105 million; ADB has contributed $60 million. 

 The programme is expected to provide alternative job opportunities in the Laos-Thailand-Myanmar golden triangle, which supplies half of the illegal drugs consumed by Europe, America and the developing countries. 

 Chinas south-western Yunnan province exports goods worth $500 million to Myanmar through a highway that runs up to Mandalay. A new bridge proposed to be built on the Mekong river at the Thailand-Laos border at a cost of $400 million will give China a second link to Myanmar through Thailand. 

 While India has upgraded a 144-km highway linking the Manipur border to Kalemigo in Myanmar, it has not been used for trade. Efforts to export diesel to the neighbouring country through this route hit a roadblock as the finance ministry did not allow Myanmar to pay in rupees.

 The customs chief at the Mae Sai border post between Thailand and Myanmar told The Telegraph that importers in Myanmar are paying in bahts for goods purchased from Thailand.

 The new bridge on Mekong will also permit China to increase its trade with Thailand as most of the trade between the two takes place along the river. The director of customs at the Chiang Saen port, where the river enters Thailand, said 10-12 vessels visit the port everyday bringing in apples, pears and vegetables from China. They carry back natural rubber, dried longans, petrol, diesel and rubber goods. The trade is reported to be growing at 35 per cent per annum and was valued at $1.25 billion between January and September this year. 

 Japanese firms, which have a manufacturing base in Thailand, will also benefit as the bridge will enable them to export motor cycles and cars directly to south-west China.

 Wockhardt bets on biotech

 OUR CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Feb. 14: Pharmaceutical major Wockhardt Ltd plans to garner about Rs 100 crore in turnover from its biotech products this year. This will include sales in the domestic market as well as exports.

 Speaking at the launch of what Wockhardt calls India?s first automatic insulin delivery device and recombinant insulin cartridge, chairman Habil Khorakiwala said, ?Although such products are available in the imported-items category, it will be the first time that the cartridge for the automatic insulin product will be made here.?

 As of now, the pen, which is the delivery device to push in the insulin, will be imported but Wockhardt said it will later begin its production in India. The cartridge, which is priced at Rs 169, will be about 20 per cent cheaper than the imported ones, which comes for over Rs 209. The pen, which has been priced at Rs 1,099, is also 20 per cent less than the prevailing price, he said.

 The recombinant insulin, Wosulin, was launched by Wockhardt about 18 months ago. Today, at the launch of the automatic delivery device and the cartridge, Khorakiwala said Wosulin as a product has helped the expanded usage among Indian diabetics by 20 per cent.

 The cartridges are being made by Wockhardt at its biotech park in Aurangabad in Maharashtra. The other biotech products of the company include Wepox, which is used for dialysis, and another drug called Interferone, which the company plans to launch in about six months? time.

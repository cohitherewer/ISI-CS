 Reliance Capital to buy Adlabs Films

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, June 30: The Anil Ambani-led Reliance Capital Ltd will acquire film producer Manmohan Shettys Adlabs Films Ltd at an estimated cost of around Rs 360 crore.

 The move is in line with the plans of Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprises (ADAE) to get started in the entertainment segment as its group companies ? Reliance Infocomm and Reliance Energy ? finetune their plans for cable television and direct-to-home businesses.

 Adlabs, a leading motion picture processing laboratory, has set up Adlabs IMAX Dome Theatre and multiplexes in many states.

 The Adlabs share opened today at Rs 206 on the Bombay Stock Exchange and closed at Rs 240.60. It was the fourth largest traded share in the B1 category. 

 We want to acquire Adlabs to infuse capital and provide management bandwidth to promising companies, a senior ADAE official said.

 ADAE is aggressively looking at opportunities in the entertainment space, even as other groups such as the Tatas and Star TV and Zee Telefilms and Sun TV are eyeing the direct-to-home segment as a future growth area.

 ADAE has recently acquired a stake in Prime Focus, a Rs 30-crore company promoted by Bollywood producer Naresh Malhotra. Prime Focus is a large end-to-end post-production and visual effects services house, which is valued at over Rs 100 crore.

 The proposed acquisition reflects our commitment to use our financial and management resources for the benefit of our shareholders. We will actively support the growth of outstanding companies with vision, a proven track record of performance and a potential to lead in new growth areas, the ADAE official added.

 Manmohan Shettys stake will be acquired through Reliance Land Pvt Ltd, a part of the Reliance Capital group. 

 Adlabs plans to set up film processing laboratories in Hyderabad, Bangalore and Calcutta to hedge against growing competition.

 In April, the company made a preferential issue to BSMA Ltd, an affiliate of Bear Stearns Companies Inc, a leading foreign fund, at a price of Rs 150 per share aggregating $6 million (Rs 26 crore).

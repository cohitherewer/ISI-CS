 HPL lenders for speedy settlement

 SUTANUKA GHOSAL

 Testing times

 Calcutta, Sept. 29: Lenders to Haldia Petrochemicals want a deadline for a settlement between promoters Purnendu Chatterjee and the Bengal government.

 The matter will come up for discussion at tomorrows board meeting. The company law board has given both parties a month to arrive at a settlement. However, we do not see things being sorted out within that time. The spat between the two shareholders is creating a negative perception, senior officials of Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) said.

 The lenders feel the spat will affect the company when it seeks more funds for its second round of expansion plans.

 Senior State Bank officials added: HPLs fundamentals are strong. But the bickerings among the promoters is posing a problem. It should be sorted out immediately.

 The agenda of the board meeting does not include anything on the settlement, however, a section of the board members feel it will be discussed informally.

 On CLBs observation on the settlement issue, industry minister Nirupam Sen said, This is not an order by the CLB, but a request.

 The case reached the law board when TCG sought to have the Bengal governments share sale to IOC rescinded. It did not succeed, but another share allotment worth Rs 135 core to IDBI was halted till the case was resolved.

 TCG claims it held the majority stake in HPL and any share put on the block should first be offered to it. The sale to IOC meant a dilution in its own holding, though Purnendu had failed to rustle up cash when the state offered to sell its 43 per cent stake. 

 Chatterjee will now have to write to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee that he is keen on a settlement. 

 The chief minister will decide whether he wants to start a negotiation, state government sources added. 

 The total equity size of HPL is Rs 1,410 crore. Of this, the state holds 36.87 per cent (Rs 520 crore), The Chatterjee Petrochem Mauritius 30.7 per cent (Rs 433 crore), The Chatterjee Petrochem India 10.99 per cent (Rs 155 crore), Tatas 3.19 per cent (Rs 45 crore) and the rest 18.22 per cent (Rs 257 crore) are with friends and associates of TCG.

 However, HPL officials made it clear that the performance of the company has not been affected due to the present spat among the shareholders.

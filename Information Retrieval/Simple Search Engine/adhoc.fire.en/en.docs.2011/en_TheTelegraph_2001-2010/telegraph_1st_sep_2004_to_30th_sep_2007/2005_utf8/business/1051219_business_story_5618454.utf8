 India Inc heaps praise on Nath

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hong Kong, Dec. 18: India Inc today hailed the draft Hong Kong ministerial declaration.

 In what can be termed as a double bonanza for the industry, the ministerial declaration took on board the principle of less than full reciprocity as a standalone provision, which will govern all market access commitments.

 The declaration also provided for reduction and elimination of tariff peaks and tariff escalations by rich nations on Indian products, signifying narrowing differences between India and its counterparts of G-9, which was formed at Hong Kong to thwart the developed nations agenda.

 Elimination of tariff peaks and escalations would result in market access for developing nations as developed countries would not be able to levy a higher duty on value-added products.

 Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra said, The explicit mention of paragraph 8 on flexibility in non-agricultural market access will allow us to place a number of manufactured items outside the ambit of the tariff reduction formula.

 The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers and the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association have welcomed the draft and said it has taken care of the key concerns raised by the industry, such as flexibility to protect indigenous industries.

 On services, Mitra said incorporating annex C in the declaration would ease the temporary movement of professionals and more liberalised commitments on cross-border supply of services. 

 On the issue of tariff reduction formula, the declaration has moved forward by identifying a formula India is comfortable with. 

 Reductions would be on the basis of the Swiss formula with coefficients based on the principle of less than full reciprocity. India, along with Brazil and Argentina, had proposed a formula with multiple coefficients based on tariff average of developing countries.

 The ministerial text also takes a step forward on removal of non-tariff barriers, a key concern of the industry.

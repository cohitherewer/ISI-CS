The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 BPO shake-out predicted

 New Delhi, March 27 (PTI): Seventy per cent of the top 15 Indian business process outsourcing start-ups will cease to exist in the coming months, said IT analyst firm Gartner.

 ?By the end of 2005, 70 per cent of the top 15 Indian-owned BPO start-ups that offer customer call-centre services will be acquired, merged or be marginalised,? it said.

 Gartner said despite the hype, only a small fraction of the customer service outsourcing will be done at offshore locations.

 ?Offshore call centres and offshore customer service outsourcing represent a tiny fraction of the market. In 2005, it is expected to be less than 2 per cent of the total market and will grow less than 5 per cent in 2007,? it said. The worldwide market for customer service outsourcing is set to grow from $8.4 billion in 2004 to $12.2 billion in 2007.

 Gartner also predicted that through 2007, 80 per cent of organisations that outsource customer service and support contact centres with the primary goal of reducing cost will fail.

 Up to 2008, 60 per cent of organisations that outsource parts of the customer-facing process will encounter customer defections and hidden costs that outweigh any potential savings they derive from outsourcing, it said.

 ?Our research shows there are significant risks associated with outsourcing customer service,? said Alexa Bona, research director at Gartner. Companies that outsource successfully can achieve cost savings of 25-30 per cent. However, Bona warned that a poorly managed model can reduce the quality of customer experience, dilute the brand value of the company and fail to deliver cost savings.

 She said most companies neglect managing the customer service experience sufficiently and often lock the organisation into long-term outsourcing contracts without conducting appropriate pilot testing.

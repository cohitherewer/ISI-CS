The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Little Master in new role

 M RAJENDRAN

 Sachin: Spreading word

 New Delhi, March 8: You can call it adult education for mobile users. Cellular operators in India have finally decided to teach their subscribers some mobile etiquette.

 Sachin Tendulkar will be AirTel?s voice, telling people how to use cell phones in public places and not to use them while driving. 

 The campaign draws on the success of an awareness campaign launched by the ministry of health which shows Amitabh Bachchan campaigning for polio vaccination.

 Mobile use is on the rise in India, which has more than 50 million subscribers. More than 50 per cent of these subscribers also own a vehicle. 

 An AirTel spokesperson said: ?Being the market leader, we at AirTel feel it is our responsibility to educate, sensitise and guide people on proper and responsible use of mobile phones. This is a belief shared both by AirTel and Sachin. quot;

 The AirTel initiative has also been inspired by liquor brand Seagram?s campaign, which says, ?Those who appreciate quality enjoy it responsibly?.

 The campaign on mobile etiquette consists of two films with safety and sensitivity as twin messages. 

 The first film urges people to refrain from using a mobile phone while driving. It shows two toy cars racing around and crashing as a phone rings in the background. Sachin picks up the car and urges people not to use their phones while driving as this could lead to accidents.

 The second film tells audience to put their phones in silent mode during performances.

 The AirTel spokesperson said: ?This is the first time ever that a mobile service operator has stood up and shouldered the responsibility of educating the masses. AirTel is not just the market leader in revenues, growth and innovative products, it is also a caring and sensitive brand.?

 Other operators like Hutch, Bharat Sanchar Nigam and Idea are also planning to launch a similar mobile manners campaign both for the print and electronic media.

 According to T. V. Ramachandran, director-general of the Cellular Operators Association of India (Coai), ?It is a good move. Worldwide, the operators provide mobile etiquette information along with the telephone connection.?

 When asked if it is safe to use a hands-free gear while driving, Ramachandran said: ?We have to be rational, if the government plans to ban use of hands free then they should ban speaking with co-passenger and also music. There are countries that allow hands free mobile as a safe mode. quot;

 Finance arm to add to Tata Motors profit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, April 26: Tata Motors expects 12 per cent of its gross profit to come from its finance arm when Tata Finance is merged with the auto major. 

 ?We believe it is not a different business. It is back to our core business, which will enhance the scalability of our business and also enable lower cost finances for customers,? Tata group chairman Ratan Tata told the shareholders at the court-convened extraordinary general meeting. 

 Tata reiterated that the merger proposal is not a ?bailout operation?. He reminded that Tata Finance has recorded profit for seven quarters.

 Earlier in a presentation, company officials said two-thirds of the profitability of an automobile company is derived from sales of spares, maintenance, resale of used vehicles and financing. The disbursement of retail finance by the company during 2004-05 has been Rs 3400 crore.

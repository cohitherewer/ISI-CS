 Ore-starved Bengal shows way to metal junction

 Calcutta, April 26: Faced with the daunting task of attracting fresh investment to the iron and steel industry in a state with no ore deposits, Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has called for greater co-operation among eastern states to help realise the full potential of the mineral and metals sector in the region.

 ?We must rise above politics in the interest of states. Economic development must be given precedence,? Bhattacharjee said at a seminar organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) on the minerals and metals industry.

 Bengal is keen that the Jindals set up a Rs 12,000-crore 5-million tonne steel plant, but the project is stuck because the state does not have any iron ore deposits. The company has made it clear that it wants secured raw material supplies over the long term for the venture.

 To keep the investment, the state has held talks on ore supplies with Jharkhand, which insisted that value addition to the iron ore must be done within its borders. As a result, there was no breakthrough in that effort.

 Bhattacharjee?s appeal is directed at ore-rich states ? Orissa, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh ? that are reluctant to offer mining lease to firms setting up plants outside.

 Citing a suggestion made by McKinsey, Bhattacharjee called for creating an Eastern State Minerals and Metals Council to sort out problems of mines in the region and help industries that rely on them.

 The CII-McKinsey report said four eastern states should set up the council to resolve issues like joint funding of infrastructure, joint development of mining areas, allocation of downstream investments so that industry does not face artificial restrictions to new plants.

 The appeal did not appear to have cut much ice with Jharkhand, whose minister for mines, Madhu Koda, offered no commitment when Bhattacharjee suggested on the sidelines of the CII event that the Jindal project could be split in a way that makes some value-addition possible there.

 ?I will speak to my chief minister about the development. Let the Jindals come up with the proposal. We will look into it,? the minister said.

 Sajjan Jindal, managing director of Jindal Vijayanagar Steel, said after his meeting with Bhattacharjee and industry minister Nirupam Sen at the Writers? Buildings that the plan will be sent to Jharkhand soon.

 Jindal said the project could be split in a manner that facilitates some value-addition in Jharkhand, for a plant near Kharagpur. ?In the first phase, we will spend Rs 200 crore in Jharkhand and Rs 5,000 crore in Bengal. The mining and pelletisation will be done in Jharkhand. The project will start once the issue is resolved,? Jindal said.

 Mining rights have become a critical issue with rising prices of basic raw materials like iron ore and coal. As companies scramble to secure their future requirement, states are linking mining leases to value addition.

 Plan gets 102-point thumbs-up from market

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Nov. 16: Stocks firmed up further on Tuesday with the sensex finishing at a six-week high of 8595.92 ? a gain of nearly 102 points, or 1.20 per cent, against Mondays close of 8494.29.

 Taking a cue from the comments of finance minister P. Chidambaram that the government was keen to divest minority stakes in select public sector units, the share prices opened on a strong note. The bell-weather index clocked 8511.10 at the beginning of trading and gradually inched up to the days high of 8606.95. Some profit booking during the later part of the day saw the share-price indicator slipping to 8595.29.

 The market seemed to have received the finance ministers statement in good faith as the overall sentiment remained positive even after the close of trading. Market analysts feel Chidambarams statement is an indication that the government is very much on course regarding its reform and divestment processes. 

 The falling global crude prices also lifted investors sentiment. 

 Share prices have been in revival mode since Diwali after receiving a severe drubbing for a month prior to that by the outflows of foreign institutional investors (FIIs). 

 However, the FIIs returned to Indian bourses shortly and have been net buyers for most of this month. It is expected that some of the leading funds that have recently registered with Sebi are likely to pump in sizeable funds. The expected high rate of growth of the economy is believed to have drawn them back to the domestic bourses.

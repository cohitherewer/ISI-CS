 Shareholders clear Reliance demerger 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Ambani: Roll call

 Mumbai, Oct. 21: Shareholders of Reliance Industries, the country?s largest private sector company, have cleared the proposal to demerge the business enterprises that are due to be handed over to Anil Ambani as part of the family settlement reached last June.

 The final outcome of the voting on the ?scheme of arrangement? will be announced on October 25 after the poll results are filed with Bombay High Court, the company said later in a statement.

 The four group companies that are being demerged from RIL are Reliance Energy Venture, Global Fuel Management Ltd, Reliance Capital Venture Ltd and Reliance Communications Venture Ltd.

 The demerger scheme, if approved, will signal the close of the unsavoury chapter on ?ownership issues? within the Reliance group that spilled into the public domain on November 17 last year.

 The extraordinary general meeting today was chaired by Justice M.L. Pendse (retired). Mukesh Ambani and the top brass were in attendance as the company secretary went through the modalities of the EGM under the chairmanship of the retired judge. 

 RIL officials did not permit mediapersons to cover the meeting, saying it was a shareholders meeting convened by the court. 

 They apparently sensed some fireworks from some RIL shareholders but that did not happen. 

 Before the start of the meeting, proxies and authorisations had been received for over 90.70 crore equity shares of Rs 10 each of the company.

 As directed by the high court of Mumbai, separate meetings of the secured creditors (including the debenture holders) and unsecured creditors of Reliance Industries were also held today under the chairmanship of Justice Pendse.

 Justice Pendse said two chartered accountants ? C.R. Mehta and Dilip Choksey ? would scrutinise the votes and submit a report to the high court.

 A couple of shareholders dissented at the EGM, but it came as no surprise as they had already objected to the proposal in the court. The shareholders ? Pramod Lodha (an advocate) and V.M. Raaste ? raised objections about the transparency and fairness in arriving at the valuations of RIL assets. RIL company secretary Vinod Ambani replied to certain questions raised at the meeting.

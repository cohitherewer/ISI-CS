 Asean forces duty rethink

 Kuala Lumpur, Dec. 13: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today agreed to be flexible about the huge list of goods that India wants to be excluded from a free trade pact after top Asean leaders strongly objected to it.

 At the fourth India-Asean summit today, Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi, who is also the chairman of the Asean, virtually forced Singhs hand with hard hitting comments. 

 Singhs promise to be flexible came after an earlier refusal by his officials to cut duties on some 1414 products, including palm oil, petro goods, crabs, toilet seats and naked and dressed dolls.

 Badawi reminded Singh about India s Look East policy and asked him to put it in the context of the way his officials were handling trade negotiations. 

 Tomorrow, India will be attending a separate and far more important East Asia summit, which is expected to eventually carve out a new economic and political grouping, rivalling European Union in the future. 

 Todays continued spat over palm oil was seen as a little embarrassing hiccup before the main course. But then, vegetable oils and petroleum form 77 per cent of Aseans exports to India and the Malaysians, who are worst hit by the refusal to cut duties on palm oil, are naturally not amused.

 Analysts here, however, saw Indias initial refusal to cut duties on palm oil and subsequent decision to be flexible and pragmatic linked to Malaysias original stand that East Asia could exclude India and later decide to take India on board. 

 Even yesterday, Badawi insisted that the driving force for East Asia would remain the Asean grouping and China, Japan and Korea, implicitly excluding India, Australia and New Zealand. 

 While China officially did not oppose Indias entry into the powerful new grouping, most felt it supported Badawis strong verbal opposition to enlarging the East Asia Summit. 

 Traditionally China has seen East Asia and even Southeast Asia as its backyard and has not been happy with the US or Indian attempts to play a role in these areas.

 However, at todays meeting, which was between India and the Asean leaders to discuss a future free trade area between the two, the Malaysians did not raise any objections to India joining or being part of the planned East Asian Summit. 

 Officials, however, doubt whether Singh will be able to keep his promise to Badawi on cutting duties on palm oil. 

 Every prime minister since Narasimha Rao has promised the Malaysians that India will cut duties on this product and every prime minister has had to eat his words as politically powerful lobbies of Maharashtra and Kerala farmers and millers who produce vegetable oil in India have forced the Central government to retain high duties on palm oil, a senior foreign affairs analyst said.

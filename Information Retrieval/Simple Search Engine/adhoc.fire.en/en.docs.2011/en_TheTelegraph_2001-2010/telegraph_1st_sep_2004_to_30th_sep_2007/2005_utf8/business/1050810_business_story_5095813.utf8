 Coke gets a new chief

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 9: Beverage major Coca-Cola today appointed Atul Singh as the new president for its India division.

 Singh replaces Sanjiv Gupta who took over as Cokes India chief in July 2003. 

 At present, Atul Singh heads the companys east, central and south China division. He will take charge with immediate effect.

 This will be Singhs second stint in India. He headed Cokes franchisee bottling operations in India between 1999 and 2002.

 Industry insiders say Gupta was unhappy after his powers were clipped following Cokes decision to restructure the Indian operations. The cola major has recently spun off the bottling operations into a separate division and placed it under the care of John Ustas, the newly appointed CEO of Coca-Cola India.

 Before joining the Indian operations, Ustas headed the beverage majors bottling operations in Norway. He will report to Steve Buffington, the regional director of Latin America and Asia for Bottling Investments.

 Until recently, Gupta was overseeing both bottling operations and Coca-Colas concentrate business here.

 After Ustas came into the company, Gupta was only left with the charge of the concentrate business, franchise bottlers and marketing operations.

 Coca-Cola India division comprises India, Sri Lanka, Bhutan and franchisees as well as bottling operations in India. 

 The company has 24 company-owned bottling operations and 26 franchisee-owned bottling plants in India. These come under its subsidiary called Hindustan Coca-Cola Beverages.

 Coca-Cola had termed the major shake up in the top management in India as structural changes that are part of long-term strategic initiatives to enhance focus on marketing and bottling operations.

 The company said the new set-up would create a dynamic partnership between the division and bottling operations by ensuring optimal strategic alignment.

 Hotel industry divided on future of budget chains

 New Delhi, Feb. 13: The hospitality industry is split wide open on the prospects for budget hotels in India.

 There are two sides in the raging debate: one reckons that soaring land prices across the country will dent the profitability of budget hotels; the other argues that the time is just ripe for establishing these hotels, which is predicated on the strong expectations of a growing demand and a sharp upswing in average room rates in the near future.

 ?Land prices are only moving northwards,? says Lalit Suri, chairman and managing director of Bharat Hotels, which operates five-star hotels. ?Given the huge cost incurred in hotel projects, it doesn?t make economic sense to enter this segment now.?

 ?When the time is ripe, we ourselves would establish them,? he adds.

 Real estate prices have risen sharply in the past year. In Delhi, for instance, realty prices have jumped by 15 to 20 per cent. Land prices in Bangalore have vaulted by almost 30 per cent.

 Nakul Anand, managing director of ITC Hotels, tends to agree with Suri?s assessment. Rising land costs are seriously denting prospects for budget hotels, he says. ?The trend (rising land prices) seems to continue in this direction, so it does not seem an opportune time to look at this segment.?

 Not everyone, however, agrees with this view. The contrarian view is that the growing demand for hotel rooms ? as the number of business travellers surges and more and more Indians travel on holidays ? and the expected rise in the average room rate (ARR) will more than offset the investments that budget hoteliers are making now.

 ?There is a great demand for hotel rooms in more than 350 cities across India,? says Shyam Suri, secretary general of the Federation of Hotels and Restaurants Association of India (FHRAI). ?India does not only comprise the four metropolitans, but also other cities. Both demand for rooms and the ARR is expected to go up by 15-20 per cent in a year?s time. There is no stopping the coming of budget hotels,? Suri added.

 The association says there is a need for over 50,000 rooms in the budget hotel segment over the next three to four years. quot;India has just scratched the surface of the budget hotels market. One will see a lot of movement in not only the budget hotels, but also in the service apartments and eco hotels, quot; said Abhijeet Malkani, regional director-India operations of NAI Global (an international real estate services firm).Malkani admits that the rising land costs is something that prospective entrepreneurs will need to factor into their estimates while computing future returns. ?Looking at the recent trends, we expect a realistic hike in real estate markets in the near future. They are unlikely to breach a 15-20 per cent band across the country.?

 The industry has a thumb rule for investment: land costs should not exceed 15 to 20 per cent of the overall project cost. However, in rare cases, hoteliers have plonked more ? as high as 25 to 30 per cent of the overall project cost ? to acquire prime land.

 Among the major hotel chains, the Tatas have decided to make an aggressive foray into the budget hotel segment with their IndiOne brand where room rates are capped at less than Rs 1000 a night. Last year, it launched its first IndiOne hotel in Bangalore. Raymond Bickson, managing director of Tatas-owned Indian Hotels Corporation Ltd (IHCL), has already indicated that the hotel chain intends to establish nearly 15 of these ?smart basic hotels? by the year-end.

 Shiela Nair, chief operating officer (COO) of Roots Corporation Ltd (a wholly-owned subsidiary of IHCL, which operates IndiOne hotels) says, ?There is no looking back on our commitment to come up with budget hotels. Nearly 15 of these hotels will be ready for operation by the year-end. We are looking at both the secondary and tertiary markets.?

 ?Yes, the land prices have gone up over the last year and that makes things slightly complex. But interested hoteliers will have to find ways and means to combat this problem with more creativity. This would require extensive research,? she added. 

 ?Budget hotels present a very encouraging proposition. The government is also fairly encouraging and will try to come up with adequate zoning of lands where these hotels could be built. Looking at the economies of scale, it will certainly be a profitable business over the next two to three years,? Nair said.

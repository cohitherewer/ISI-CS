 Reserve supply douses crude fire

 London, Sept. 5 (Reuters): Oil prices fell on Monday, extending Fridays sharp drop, after the release by industrialised nations of emergency oil stocks to prevent a US fuel crisis after Hurricane Katrina. Worries about US consumer confidence and the impact on fuel demand and economic growth from Katrina also undermined the oil market.

 London Brent crude was off $1.34 at $64.72, back to levels seen before Katrina disrupted US Gulf oil production and refining operations. Closed for Labor Day, US crude finished at $67.57 a barrel on Friday, after peaking last week at a record high of $70.85 a barrel.

 Literally and figuratively, I think weve weathered the storm, as the release of strategic reserves has calmed the market, said David Thurtell, commodity strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia.

 The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Friday announced that its 26 industrialised member countries would release 2 million barrels per day (BPD) of oil for 30 days to compensate for the loss of US crude and refining output. It is the first time since the 1991 Gulf crisis that the IEA has tapped government oil stocks.

 Analysts said the move could mark a change in oil market psychology that, at last weeks peak, saw crude up 60 percent since January 1.

 Governments have shown that if there is a substantial supply risk they are willing to act, and act quickly, said Gary Ross, chief executive of leading US energy consultancy, PIRA Energy.

 The US will auction off 1 million BPD of crude from national reserves, while European and Asian countries will focus on releasing refined products.

 Govt to sell Maruti rump holding

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, Sept. 14: The government is mulling the option of selling its entire stake in Maruti Udyog, the joint venture established over 25 years ago with Suzuki Motors of Japan.

 The government has an 18.28 per cent stake in the carmaker at present. Earlier this month, it had decided to sell 8 per cent to domestic institutions through a process of competitive bids and raise around Rs 1,000 crore.

 ?We are now open to the idea of selling the remaining shares in Maruti and exit from the company,? Union heavy industries minister Santosh Mohan Dev said today.

 He said AV Birla group?s Grasim Industries, Ambuja Cement and the Dalmias were in the fray to acquire the sick plants of Cement Corporation of India (CCI) that have been shut down. 

 ?The Birlas and Ambujas are interested in buying the plants of CCI,? Dev said.

 Dev also said ONGC was looking at taking over Tide Water Oil, a subsidiary of Andrew Yule and Company. ?There is nothing wrong in one public sector company taking over another company,? he said. 

 Besides Tide Water Oil, the government is planning to sell the electrical equipment business of Andrew Yule. 

 The sale of 228,390 shares that the government holds in Tide Water Oil would fetch around Rs 400 crore based on the current stock price of the company. 

 The minister said Bhel had been taken off the divestment list of the government.

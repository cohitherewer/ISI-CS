 Industry recipe to check BPO fraud

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, July 21: A comprehensive legal framework for data security is required for the country to leverage the growing opportunities thrown open by business process outsourcing services. This was highlighted today at a seminar organised by the Assocham. 

 A comprehensive security system is required to prevent recurrence of another Karan Bahree case, which can damage the prospects of the Indian industry, BPO pioneer Raman Roy said at the seminar on Legal Strategies for BPO Companies post-Karan Bahree Case.

 Media reported the case without having gone into the facts. They were not aware whether Karan Bahree was a BPO employee or his employers were a BPO firm or not, Roy pointed out.

 It is a disturbing trend that while swindling of millions of dollars in the US and Europe through credit-card fraud is not highlighted, an unconfirmed report was flashed as the top story, he added.

 Roy urged BPO companies to install a comprehensive security system with the help of policy makers to stop recurrence of such cases. 

 Pavan Duggal, chairman of the chambers cyber law committee sought the intervention of the Prime Minister for drafting a stringent law to prevent theft of data.

 However, no major progress has been seen till now. The country needs stringent data protection norms to shield the BPO industry from such incidents, Duggal said.

 Idea suitors hang up on stake deal

 New Delhi, June 13 (PTI): The Singapore Technologies Telemedia (STT) and Telekom Malaysia (TMI) consortium has pulled out of the transaction for acquiring a 47.7 per cent stake in Idea Cellular for a consideration of $390 million.

 It is with deep regret that the transaction has been called off since we have not secured the necessary regulatory approvals within the six-month period allowed by the sale agreement, Singapore Telemedia said in a statement.

 India continues to be an important market for ST Telemedia and we look forward to exploring other opportunities in future. Over the past few months, the consortium, together with Idea, has worked diligently and closely with the Indian government to address every matter that has been discussed, it said.

 Telekom Malaysia Berhad wishes to announce that the proposed acquisition by TM International, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TM, as part of a consortium with ST Telemedia, of 47.7 per cent of the enlarged equity interest in Idea has lapsed in accordance with the terms of the transaction documents, a statement from Telekom Malaysia said.

 The transaction lapsed as approvals from the department of telecommunications and the Foreign Investment Promotion Board did not come through by June 11, the date specified in the transaction documents, it said.

 TM is currently reviewing other options available for investing in India and the region, the statement added.

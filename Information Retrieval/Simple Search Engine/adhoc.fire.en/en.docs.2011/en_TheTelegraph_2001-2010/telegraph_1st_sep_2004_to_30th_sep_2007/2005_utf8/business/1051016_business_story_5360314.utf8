 Bajaj Auto net profit jumps 48%

 Mumbai, Oct. 15: Bajaj Auto has reported a better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter of the current financial year. The company has posted a 48.5 per cent rise in net profit to Rs 291 crore for the July-September period from Rs 196 crore a year ago.

 The Pune-based two-wheeler makers results may work as a soothing balm on the stock market injury dealt by the disappointing numbers posted by ACC.

 On Friday, the cement maker gave a fright to investors by reporting below-expected results that didnt show any effect of the rising cement prices on the companys operating profits and only extra-ordinary income shored up its profits.

 Bajaj Auto figures, however, demonstrated that its strategy to focus on the premium end of the motorcycle segment has paid off. Whats more is that the sales of its three-wheelers have again taken off as demand for auto-rickshaws has picked up after a long absence.

 The second-largest motorcycle manufacturer was superseded by Hero Honda ? a joint venture between the Munjals and Honda of Japan ? in 2002. At that time, Bajaj Auto relied heavily on sales of scooters and used to make motorcycles with technological support from Kawasaki of Japan. It was caught on the wrong foot as market demand shifted towards motor cycles. 

 Rajiv Bajaj, the young scion of the Bajaj family, reworked the business strategy. Over the last couple of months, a resurgent Bajaj Auto is growing faster than its competitor though Hero Honda operates on a higher base with more number of motorcycles sold.

 Bajajs total income during the reporting quarter rose by 30 per cent to Rs 2003 crore. Its operating margins have risen to 17.2 per cent from 15.7 per cent a year earlier. The improved margins have come against rising input costs. 

 Bajajs motorbike sales leapt 32 per cent for the quarter ended September 30 to 445,557 units despite a slack June and July. 

 Sales of auto-rickshaws rose nearly 6 per cent to 68,485 units and its total vehicle sales rose 24 per cent to 554,220 units. 

 Buoyed by the growth, Bajaj Auto has lined up Rs 200-crore investment to expand capacity and has recently raised its bike manufacturing capacity to 200,000 units a month. 

 The company is contemplating to enter the Southeast Asian markets through sales alliances or stake purchases in local firms abroad.

 Inflation rate drops below 6%

 OUR BUREAU

 New Delhi, Jan. 14: The rate of inflation dipped below the 6-per-cent mark after almost seven months to 5.78 per cent during the week ended January 1. The fall was caused by a drop in prices of fuels, vegetables and fruits, edible oils and other food items.

 Even though manufactured products were costlier, the wholesale price index (WPI) based inflation rate fell by 0.61 per cent from 6.39 per cent in the previous week.

 The finance ministry and the Reserve Bank had taken several steps to bring the inflation rate to 5.78 per cent, lower than 6.45 per cent a year ago.

 While the point-to-point inflation rate fell, the broad-based WPI rose 0.2 per cent to 188.6 points due to costly manufactured products and furnace oil. The index was at 178.3 points a year ago.

 The government has revised upward its inflation figure to 7.93 per cent for the week ended November 6 against the provisional figure of 7.76 per cent. The final WPI stood corrected at 190.6 against the provisional 190.3 in the first week of November.

 The drop in the rate of inflation could be attributed to cheaper fuel prices, which fell 0.2 per cent. The primary articles group index was unchanged at 186.1, although prices of food articles dipped 0.1 per cent and that of non-food articles rose 0.3 per cent. The group index was 181.7 a year ago.

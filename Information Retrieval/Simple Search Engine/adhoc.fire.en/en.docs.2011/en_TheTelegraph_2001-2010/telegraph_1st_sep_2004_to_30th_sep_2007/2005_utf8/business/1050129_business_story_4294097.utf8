 Cash push for retailing

 RAJA GHOSHAL

 New Delhi, Jan. 28: Organised sector retailing in India is poised for emphatic growth with investments in the sector estimated at about Rs 2,500 crore over the next two to three years.

 A study on the future and trends of retailing in India by KSA Technopak says that by the end of 2010, an estimated Rs 20,000 crore is likely to be invested in the sector.

 Harminder Sahni, associate director, KSA Technopak, says, ?The investment prediction in the sector is based on the current situation when foreign direct investment (FDI) in retail is not being permitted. If it is allowed, the quantum of investment will go up by about four times.?

 The KSA Technopak study, which is making the retailing prediction till 2010, estimates that the retailing industry in India is about Rs 930,000 crore and is expected to grow at 5 per cent a year.

 The size of the organised retail market is estimated at Rs 28,000 crore at present, which is only 3 per cent of the total retailing market. The organised retailing market is projected to grow at the rate of 25-30 per cent a year to reach Rs 100,000 crore by 2010, said Sahni. 

 As of now, it is the fashion segments, which corner the lion?s share within organised retailing, Sahni said. These would comprise clothing and fashion accessories, jewellery, watches, footwear and beauty care products and services. ?Such a pattern is in line with retail evolution in other parts of the world. Fashion usually leads the retail development in early stages of evolution, which is then followed by other categories like food, grocery, and durables,? said Sahni. 

 The study says scalable and profitable retail models are well established for most of the retail models across categories. Large Indian corporate groups like the Tatas, Reliance, Raheja, ITC, Bombay Dyeing, Murugappa and Piramal have expressed serious interest in investing in the retailing sector. Many of them are already serious players in the retail business.

 At present, FDI is not allowed in the retail sector except through the cash-and carry wholesale trading route. Although a number of foreign retailers have entered the Indian market over the last few years, most are cautious and have preferred to wait and watch.

 Oil majors to retail kerosene

 Aiyar: New approach

 New Delhi, May 12: The government has cleared a proposal to revamp the kerosene distribution system in the country to ensure that the highly subsidised cooking fuel reaches the poorer section and is not diverted to adulterate diesel.

 Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said in the Lok Sabha today that the pilot project would be first implemented in 10 per cent of the development blocks nationwide for six months. After this, the scheme would be independently assessed and based on the experience gained, it would be expanded across the country.

 Under the new scheme, Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum will establish at least one kerosene dealership in each development block. 

 At present, less than half of the blocks are covered and there is excessive concentration in the urban areas. At least five to 10 sub-wholesale points will be located in each block.

 A dedicated fleet of clearly marked tanker-trucks will be used to transport the kerosene to the distribution outlets. This is expected to ensure transparency as the public will know that these trucks are carrying kerosene for the public distribution system.

 The oil industry development board will provide funds to marketing companies for setting up modern storage tanks with a minimum capacity of 20,000 litres. 

 Electronically metered dispensing pumps will be installed and an adequate number of barrels decorated with a special logo will be provided for delivery to the sub-wholesale points. Supplies to these points will be made under the direct supervision of oil companies.

 The distribution of kerosene at the fair price shops will be made more transparent and village panchayats will be empowered to supervise the availability of kerosene. 

 A reporting mechanism will be put in place for the panchayats to apprise the state administration and oil companies of any flaws in the working of the distribution system.

 Relief run after VW cash pledge

 G. S. RADHAKRISHNA

 Hyderabad, July 22: The Andhra government is relieved at Volkswagens readiness to pay the 2.10 million euros that its sacked executive, Helmuth Schuster, swindled through a shady outfit, even though there is no word the German giants project will return to Vizag.

 VW solicitors sent an email to state industry secretary Lakshmi Parthasarathy, accepting moral responsibility for the money allegedly siphoned off by Vashisht Wahan, the fly-by-night company floated by Schuster.

 We are arranging the payment of 2.10 million euros, or its equivalent, to the government of Andhra Pradesh. The money was received by our representative, Schuster, without any authority to do so, the email said.

 The message clarified that the VW had nothing to do with either Vashisht Wahan or the sum authorities in Andhra Pradesh transferred to its bank account in Delhi.

 We wish to clarify that legally and technically, our company has no link with Vashisht Wahan or any amount paid by your government into its account. We will forward the amount immediately without prejudice to our stand that Volkswagen has no link with either Vashisht Wahan or the government, the Volkswagen email said. 

 The car-maker sacked Shuster on June 22 and hired KPMG to scan all deals of the tainted official. The decision to refund follows an internal investigation. In its Thursday mail, the firm even urged the government to push ahead with the planned CBI probe into the project.

 The VW message calmed nerves in the state secretariat, where officials have been on the edge ever since the lid was blown off Schusters shenanigans a few weeks back. However, it also posed a dilemma for the government, which will now have to decide whether CBI needs to step in even after it has been reassured of its money. Andhra authorities have not yet written to the Centre, something they are required to for a Central probe.

 The official response from the state government has, however, been muted. Neither the minister in charge of industry, J. Geeta Reddy, nor chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy would speak until the official VW word came in. We are waiting for an official communication from Volkswagen, was all that D. Somayavulu, state advisor on economic affairs, would say.

 It appears that the chief ministers office has sent out instructions to bureaucrats and ministers to keep mum till Volkswagen responds formally and the states cash returns. 

 The companys mail yesterday was a reply to the letter from industry secretary Lakshmi Parthasarathy seeking an appointment with the CEO of Volkswagen in Germany. She had explained that the government was keen on the project in spite of the unfortunate developments involving Schuster. We are ready to come to Germany discuss the project in our state, she said. 

 The car-maker did not make any commitment in its message, beyond saying it was ready to talk about it. 

 Dates for the official visit will be announced in a day or two.

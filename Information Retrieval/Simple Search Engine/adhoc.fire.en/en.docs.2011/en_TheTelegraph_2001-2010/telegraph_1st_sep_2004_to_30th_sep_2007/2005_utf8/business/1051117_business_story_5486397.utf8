 Guidant revival a tough task for J amp;J

 Chicago, Nov. 16 (Reuters): The discounted price Johnson amp; Johnson will pay to acquire Guidant Corp reflects the tough reality it faces in restoring the heart-device makers market share and reputation after product recalls, analysts said Tuesday.

 Guidant is damaged goods a bit right now, and I just wonder if J amp;J will be getting the growth that they hoped for out of this, said John Calcagnini, analyst with CIBC World Markets.

 The diversified health-products maker said it agreed to pay $21.5 billion to acquire Guidant ? 15 per cent less than it originally offered late last year. That was before Guidant recalled its lucrative implantable cardioverter defibrillators, or ICDs, due to safety concerns.

 Guidant has been rebuked for failing to inform doctors about potential defects that came to light after a 21-year-old heart patient died of cardiac arrest after his Guidant-made device short-circuited. It also faces lawsuits from shareholders and New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.

 Guidant has since resumed sales of the devices, which regulate abnormal heart rhythms and guard against heart failure, but its reputation has been tarnished, and it has lost market share to competitors St. Jude Medical Inc and Medtronic Inc, analysts and physicians said.

 Dr Samin Sharma, head of interventional cardiology at Mt. Sinai Medical Center, said Guidants position in the ICD market appears to have slipped to third after many years in the No. 2 spot behind Medtronic.

 At present, the confidence of the physicians and community is down, but I think that they will bounce back, he said of Guidant.

 Johnson amp; Johnson, which makes drug-coated stents that prop open clogged heart arteries, has said it is buying Guidant in part to expand its product line to include cardiac rhythm management devices that regulate fast and slow heartbeats.

 Guidants revenue growth is expected to add about 1 per cent to Johnson amp; Johnsons overall revenue growth annually over the next several years, Calcagnini said.

 Weve spoken to some ICD patients and electrophysiologists, and obviously people are questioning whether to use Guidant products. J amp;J will try to bring a new face to that, come to the rescue and institute J amp;J-type quality control and regulatory compliance to that organisation, he said.

 Analysts said Guidant quickly recovered about 80 per cent of its lost market share once it resumed selling its devices following the recalls this past summer.

 But it may never recoup a portion of its lost share, said analyst Eli Kammerman of independent research firm Cathay Financial.

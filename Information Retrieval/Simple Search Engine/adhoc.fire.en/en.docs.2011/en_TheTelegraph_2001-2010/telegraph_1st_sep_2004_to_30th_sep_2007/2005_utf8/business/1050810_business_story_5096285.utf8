 Overhaul for brand-wagon

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 9: The Tatas are planning another makeover of the corporate brand, whose estimated value has leapfrogged to $6 billion (more than Rs 25,000 crore) from its 1997 assessment of a modest Rs 3,500 crore.

 The group that first set up a textile mill in 1874 wants to project a youthful and a global image. It also plans to work on a new corporate logo, which is in sync with its global ambitions. Tower Partners of Atlanta has been hired for the job that the Tatas call periodic refreshing.

 Interbrands of UK made the last valuation in an exercise that covered TCS, Indian Hotels, Tata Tea, Tata Steel and Tata Motors. This time, 17 group companies are part of the drill, expected to be completed soon.

 R. Gopalakrishnan, a board member of the Tata Sons, the main holding company of the group, estimates the intangible value of the brand at a fourth of its market capitalisation. 

 Conservative estimates put the brand value at Rs 25,000 crore, given that the value of all group shares is well over Rs 1 lakh crore in the stock market. 

 You dont manage perception, you manage reality, said Gopalakrishnan, when asked about the management. 

 The group could be one of the oldest business entities in the world. Given that the average life-span of a Fortune 500 firm is 40 years, Gopalakrishnan said the Tata brand has outlived this benchmark by over 3.5 times. 

 He pointed out that the Tatas instituted Trusteeship well before the Carnegies and Rockefellers of the world. The group also takes credit for introducing an eight-hour workday and concepts like maternity leave. 

 Inspired by global majors like Nokia, which re-engineered itself from being a timber company to a leading cellular handset maker, the Tatas have also reconfigured the group to straddle the old economy as well as the new-economy sectors, such as software and telecom.

 My belief is that over the next 8-10 years, there will be sweeping changes within the group, Gopalakrishnan said. 

 Unlike many of its peers, the Tata group has seen only five chairmen since it was founded. This has helped the company imbibe the character of its leaders, he added.

 While the Tatas are still trying to get their act together in telecom, Gopalakrishnan said this had also happened with hotels, where it took the group several decades to turn around. This was true of chemicals as well.

The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Tug-of-war looms over port upgrade

 S.P.S PANNU 

 TURN-KEY

 New Delhi, Nov. 20: A controversy seems to be brewing over the location of two world-class shipyards proposed to be built at an investment of Rs 6,000 crore.

 Shipping minister T.R. Baalu told The Telegraph that global tenders would be floated for preparing project reports on several ports and then the ports will be selected. 

 Shipping secretary D.T. Joseph, on the other hand, has shortlisted Paradip on the east coast and Cochin on the west coast for setting up the shipyards. 

 He has even set up a panel headed by the chairman of the Jawahar Lal Nehru Port Trust to look at the possibility of setting up shipyards at Paradip and Cochin ports. The consultants for the project are likely to be appointed after the JNPT chief submits the report.

 Joseph has chosen Paradip and Cochin ports because of their deeper harbours, which can be used to make big ships. He said these two ports could be the starting point. However, Baalu may shift the venue of the proposed east-coast shipyard to Tamil Nadu. 

 Talking about developing Sagar as a new port, Baalu said, ?Even Sagar could be one of the ports to set up the shipyard.? However, the Sagar port is being developed primarily to reduce the congestion at Haldia and Calcutta ports and enable bigger vessels to berth. 

 Domestic shipping firms such as Shipping Corporation of India and Great Eastern Shipping Co have placed orders for new ships with South Korean shipyards. These companies also send large ships for repair abroad as indigenous shipyards are too small. The shipping ministry is keen to reverse this trend. 

 Cochin Shipyard Ltd is the only shipyard in the country, which has the capacity to build and repair large ocean-going vessels. However, its capacity of 130,000 DWT will have to be expanded as current shipbuilding orders are mainly for VLCC and the smaller Aframax tankers constitute only a minor portion. 

 With the exception of the Cochin shipyard, the other 20 shipyards in the country are either running in losses or are merely breaking even. Due to lack of orders, the capacity utilisation of Indian shipyards ranges from 20-50 per cent. 

 Under its national maritime development programme, the ministry has estimated an outlay of Rs 2,800 crore for upgrading the state-owned shipyards over the next 10 years, while private shipyards will need an investment of Rs 1,200 crore.

 There is a huge opportunity for Indian shipyards in the overseas market as leading shipbuilders have their capacities booked and are refusing further orders. Foreign shipbuilders such as Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Hyundai, Daewoo, China Ship and Dalian are not taking any more orders as their capacities are fully booked till 2007. 

 The Clipper group of Denmark had to place orders for four ships with Cochin Shipyard as the leading firms could not take the orders. The vessels are expected to be delivered this fiscal.

 Usha Martin net profit leaps 72%

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Oct. 11: Usha Martin has reported a 72 per cent jump in net profit for the quarter ended September 30.

 The companys profit after tax rose to Rs 14.85 crore from Rs 8.63 crore posted in the same period last year. 

 However, the wire rope manufacturers net sales declined during the period under review. Net sales dropped 6 per cent at Rs 293.35 crore against Rs 312.15 crore a year ago.

 For the first six months of the current financial year, the company has reported a 67 per cent rise in profit before-tax at Rs 43.99 crore against Rs 26.35 crore in the same period last year. Profit after tax increased 72 per cent to Rs 28.08 crore from Rs 16.78 crore a year ago. 

 Net sales during the April to September period dipped to Rs 559.39 crore against Rs 567.60 crore in the corresponding previous period. 

 Usha Martin, which produces speciality steel, has started its own iron ore mining recently. This is expected to boost the bottomline as the company will be able to procure raw materials at a lower cost. 

 The company has also chalked out a Rs 462-crore expansion plan. It has issued global depository receipts and warrants to promoters to raise Rs 220 crore to fund the expansion.

 Coca-Cola cashes in on mobile mania

 M. RAJENDRAN

 Call for all

 New Delhi, July 12: Coca-Cola has drawn up plans to cash in on the popularity of cellular phones.

 After the success of the Sprite ghanta bajega, ghanti bajegi consumer initiative launched this summer, Coca-Cola India plans to roll out contests using the mobile technology in the next few months.

 Company sources said the contests would focus on new drinks and variants of the existing products.

 Vikas Gupta, vice-president (marketing) for Coca-Cola India, said, Todays youth want to interact on a one-to-one basis. The mobile short messaging service (SMS) gives them that freedom. We want to tap this opportunity to connect with this segment.

 Innovative marketing programmes are being designed to tap the potential. Under the one-month promotional offer for Sprite, a winner was selected every hour from the SMS sent by a computer draw.

 Gupta said, The initiative is the first under-the-crown (UTC) consumer programme launched nationally. We selected the latest Nokia N-Gage QD gaming phone as the prize considering the increasing popularity of mobile gaming.

 The FMCG company has received more than 10 lakh SMS responses in a month. Of these, the majority has been generated from the four metros and other key cities like Hyderabad, Bangalore and Ahmedabad.

 Another interesting trend noticed by the company was that of the total SMS traffic generated, those that originated from landline phones accounted for only 25 per cent, with the rest coming in from mobile phones. It further reflected the immense popularity of mobile phones among the youth.

 Coke first experimented with mobile technology last year when it launched an offer for free game downloads. A mobile user could download a game and pick up coke icons on way to the final destination.

 It was a tremendous hit and we had more than 30,000 downloads. That was the defining moment. The decision was taken and mobile technology will form the base for our future promotions. The success of Sprite is being showcased by our India team at the international marketing forum to demonstrate the power of mobile phone and the way to leverage it for FMCG products, said Gupta.

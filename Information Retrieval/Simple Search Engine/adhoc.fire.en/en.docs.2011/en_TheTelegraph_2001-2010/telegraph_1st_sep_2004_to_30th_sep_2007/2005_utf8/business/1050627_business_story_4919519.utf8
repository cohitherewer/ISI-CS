 Q amp;A

 Tedious TDS

 My brother, a 65-year-old NRI, had invested in a scheme of HDFC Mutual Fund with instructions to pay a fixed sum of money into his NRE account. The fund house has deducted tax at source on the total amount last year, which was less than Rs 8000. Is TDS applicable and, if not, how does he go about obtaining a refund?

 S. Haldar, by e-mail 

 Tax is not deducted at source on any payments made by mutual funds. However, when a mutual fund pays any dividend on any of its debt schemes, there is a dividend distribution tax, which is deducted from the dividend amount. Also, if any withdrawal is made from an equity fund, a securities transaction tax is deducted. Thus, it would be advisable to get in touch with the fund house and ask for the necessary details regarding the deducted amount.

 Other income

 I earn Rs 4 lakh under the head other sources of income. For the financial year 2005-06, can I get the full deduction on taxable income if I save Rs 1 lakh in Public Provident Fund? Also, does the Rs 1 lakh deduction on income include the interest for home loans?

 Sumita Bhattacharya, Uttarpara

 The investment limit of Public Provident Fund remains at Rs 70,000 and has not been increased to Rs 1 lakh. The deduction on income includes repayment of housing loan for both the principal and interest. However, since there is an additional tax benefit for interest payment up to Rs 1,50,000 under the head income from house property, it is advisable to utilise the deduction under section 80C for principal repayments.

 Debenture drama

 I had received non-convertible debentures from Hindustan Lever Limited as bonus in January 2002. In January 2005, the company has redeemed the debentures. Is this amount taxable? 

 Radhe Shyam Bhartia, by e-mail

 We assume that you had included the value of bonus debentures in your total income for 2001-02. In that case, you will not have to pay any tax on the principal amount. You will have to pay tax on interest, if any, paid by the company on the debentures.

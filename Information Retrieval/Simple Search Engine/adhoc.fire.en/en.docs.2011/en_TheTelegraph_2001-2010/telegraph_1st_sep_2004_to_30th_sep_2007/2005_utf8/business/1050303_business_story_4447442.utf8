 Suzuki clears crossover course

 OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES

 March 1: Suzuki Motor Corp, a majority partner in Maruti, today said it will introduce in India a new crossover model being developed in partnership with Italy?s Fiat Auto.

 ?We expect the car, which would be a crossover between a small car and a SUV, to be introduced in India and Europe by next year,? Suzuki Motor board member Hirotaka Ono said on the sidelines of the 75th Geneva motor show. Analysts see this as a cheaper alternative to a mini-Pajero. 

 He said the car would be powered by a diesel engine, which could have a capacity between 1.5 and 2 litres. ?I cannot reveal the exact specifications right now,? he added.

 Late last month, Suzuki, which has a 54 per cent stake in Maruti, said it would develop two global models by 2007 to stave off competition in India, where it was facing competition from Korean and Japanese carmakers.

 Suzuki is ready to launch the Swift in India. The premium hatchback will be taking on Hyundai Motor?s Getz.

 Swift has been jointly developed by the engineers of Maruti and Suzuki. It is expected to be launched in India within two to three months, the Maruti spokesperson said. The model has been paraded at the Paris and Tokyo auto shows.

 Ono said India was important for Suzuki?s overall plans, which requires new models.

 At present, Maruti occupies the leadership in the Indian passenger car market with a market share of around 50 per cent. In September last year, Maruti and Suzuki announced a whopping Rs 6,000 crore investment for India. This includes money to set up a diesel engine plant. 

 The crossover car in India will pose a big question mark for Maruti Udyog. Following the announcement at the Geneva Motor show, a Maruti Spokesperson said: ?The launch of the cross-over car for India has been announced by our parent, Suzuki. However, right now, Maruti will not like to comment on the issue.? 

 On Monday, Maruti said its sales growth was only 3.17 per cent in February 2005, moderated by expectations of a cut in prices ahead of the budget. The sales of the flagship model, Maruti 800, skidded 41 per cent.

 In all, 43,603 units were sold last month compared with 42,263 units in the same period of the last financial year, a company statement said. Sale of the Maruti 800 declined to 8,038 units last month from 13,518 units. 

 Meanwhile, the automobile industry, which is happy about the customs duty cut in the budget for inputs and raw materials, is passing on the benefits to the customer as prices cuts in top-end cars. 

 After Honda and Toyota, Hyundai will slash prices of its Elantra and Sonata car.

 Myanmar holds out hope for Bengal

 SAMBIT SAHA

 The pipe dream 

 Calcutta, March 3: The prospects of natural gas reaching eastern India, especially Bengal, from Myanmar has brightened with the neighbouring country increasing the reserve estimate for A-1 block by 50 per cent. 

 The block, where Gail India Ltd and ONGC has a combined 30 per cent share, is now said to contain 20 trillion cubic foot (TCF) gas.

 The development gains significance since Gail is planning to bring the gas with Bengal being the first landfall point in India.

 Gail is looking at a number of possible routes, including a Myanmar-Bangladesh-India pipeline, and a submarine route to Haldia.

 Bengal will be a direct beneficiary of the development as a larger chunk of the gas will be made available to the industry here.

 When contacted GAIL officials confirmed the development.

 ?We have received a message from Daewoo of Korea, which is the operator of the block,? a Gail official told The Telegraph.

 ?Prospect looks good in the A-1 block where the estimated reserve has been upgraded. It is now in the neighbourhood of 20 TCF,? he added.

 The A-1 block is located in the Shwe Field off Myanmar?s western Rakhine coast. 

 The revision was done after the third oil well was dug and test-run carried out on Tuesday.

 The block A-1 with two oil wells initially explored was found to contain gas up to 6 TCF or 170 billion cubic-meters (BCM) and the whole block was previously estimated to yield up to 14 TCF (396.2 BCM) when it was discovered early last year. 

 After the third well at the block was explored, the entire block was reassessed to hold up to 20 TCF, much bigger than the Reliance find in KG basin.

 Five more oil wells at the block will be dug.

 Daewoo, in partnership with South Korea Gas Corporation, ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) and Gail, had been exploring and developing the block since 2000 under agreement with Myanmar. Daewoo holds 60 per cent stake, while South Korea Gas Corporation has 10 per cent, OVL 20 per cent and Gail 10 per cent. 

 The consortium is also carrying out gas exploration at another block called A-3, adjacent to A-1. 

 With the estimated reserve going up to 20 TCF, a bigger slice of gas will be available for India.

 ?It is now pretty much sure that eastern India will have access to natural gas from one of the three sources; the Gail-Gazprom block off the Digha coast, ONGC offshore block near the Sunderbans or Myanmar. 

 At this point the last option seems most promising notwithstanding the challenge to bring the gas to mainland India,? an observer said.

 In January, India, Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed to work on a 290-km pipeline, which will run through Arakan in Myanmar, Mizoram and Tripura before crossing Bangladesh to Calcutta.

 Some gas might come in the form of compressed natural gas (CNG) in ships, which can make two round trips from Myanmar to east coast of India every day. An LNG option is being considered as well.

 The pipeline construction, operation and maintenance will be taken by an international consortium.

 Bangladesh will get about $125 million as transit fee. But it seems Dhaka wants a bigger deal. 

 It wants New Delhi to allow bring hydroelectricity from Nepal and Bhutan, provide the two Himalayan countries with transit facilities and reduce trade gap with Bangladesh.

 Merrill income rises 49% 

 New York, Oct. 18 (Reuters): Merrill Lynch amp; Company on Tuesday reported quarterly net income climbed 49 per cent to record levels as underwriting and trading revenue jumped.

 Net income for the third quarter rose to $1.38 billion, or $1.40 a share, from $922 million, or 93 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts average earnings forecast was $1.19 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.

 Merrill Lynchs investment banking net revenue rose 33 per cent from a year earlier. Investment banking revenue is growing industrywide as merger and acquisition activity increases.

 Citigroup on Monday said stronger investment banking revenue helped lift its net income 35 per cent last quarter.

 Merrills trading revenue rose 73 per cent as debt trading produced record quarterly net revenue. 

 Merill shares have been among the weaker performers in the brokerage sector. This year due to relatively slow trading among the individual investors, analysts said.

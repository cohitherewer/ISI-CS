 Petro bonds put on the backburner

 Time to refill

 New Delhi, June 13: Life?s difficult for public sector oil companies. 

 The finance ministry is dragging its feet on the Rs 5,500-crore bonds to be issued to petroleum firms in lieu of their arrears from the oil pool account. 

 The companies are already under severe financial strain due to skyrocketing crude prices.

 Almost 80 per cent of the arrears from the oil pool account were converted into bonds in 2002. The government has now decided that the remaining 20 per cent will be issued once the final report of the comptroller and auditor general (CAG) is submitted. 

 Sources said the petroleum ministry requested the finance ministry in January that the Rs 5,500-crore bonds be cleared as the final CAG report had come through.

 After repeated reminders, the finance ministry has now decided that since no budgetary provision has been made for the bonds, the petroleum ministry should submit a fresh proposal. The oil firms are also losing out on the interest that would have accrued on these bonds. 

 The arrears from the kitty are due to the firms on account of the subsidy on kerosene and LPG and the extra costs incurred on transporting fuel.

 Since the government was short of liquidity, it had used the money in the account to reduce the budget deficit and had decided to issue bonds instead to oil companies. 

 However, the oil companies are now facing a financial crisis as the prices of petro products have not been raised despite an increase of over $10 per barrel in global crude rates. 

 Indian Oil chairman S. Behuria has said the company is headed for a net loss of Rs 600 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal.

 Hindustan Petroleum, Bharat Petroleum, and IBP are also plunging into the red.

 These companies are borrowings more to meet crude purchases, which constitutes 90 per cent of the cost of production of petroleum products. The bonds would help spruce up their balance sheets and enable them to borrow at lower rates of interest.

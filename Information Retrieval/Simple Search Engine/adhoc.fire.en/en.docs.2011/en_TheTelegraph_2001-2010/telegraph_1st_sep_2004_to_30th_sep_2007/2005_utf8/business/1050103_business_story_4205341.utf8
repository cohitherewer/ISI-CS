The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Move to help small units

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Jan. 2: Union small-scale industries minister Mahabir Singh today proposed improved Centre-state co-ordination for the development of small enterprises.

 Singh, who reviewed the progress of small units in the state in the presence of his Bengal counterpart, Bansagopal Chaudhury, proposed regular dialogue among various central and state promotional agencies so that the problems faced by the sector could be tackled speedily.

 Chaudhury said information on many central promotional schemes did not reach the state in time for entrepreneurs to take full advantage. In respect of funding, too, central agencies and commercial banks take an unusually long time, causing problems for entrepreneurs, Chaudhury added. 

 Chaudhury said state-based entrepreneurs found it difficult to avail of loans under the Credit Guarantee Fund Scheme, initiated by the Centre. 

 Under the scheme, banks and financial institutions are supposed to provide loans up to Rs 25 lakh to small entrepreneurs without any collateral security. 

 ?But very few entrepreneurs could actually avail of them,? he said.

 Orissa keeps mines ready for Posco

 DEBABRATA MOHANTY

 Bhubaneswar, May 6: Orissa has reserved two big iron ore mines for Posco in anticipation that the deal for the 12-million-tonne steel project will be signed next week. 

 While top Orissa government officials, including chief secretary Subas Pani and steel secretary Bhaskar Chatterjee, are drafting a fresh MoU, the state has reserved the Gandhamardan and Malangtuli mines for Poscos $12 billion steel project. The two mines have nearly 400 million tonnes of high-grade iron ore deposits.

 In 1995, the Orissa Mining Corporation had formed a joint venture with Rio Tinto for production of 15 million tonnes of iron ore annually from Gandhamardan and Malangtoli deposits ? two open-pit iron ore mines in the Keonjhar district. 

 The project involved mining lease of Gandhamardan and Malangtuli mines, dedicated rail link to Paradip Port and development of the port. However, the project could not take off after Rio Tinto withdrew in 2002, declaring the quality of ore not high enough and probably also shaken by local accusations that it would be operating in a forest zone. Besides, issues over rail and port development and direct export of iron ore could not be resolved in time.

 But the reservation of Gandhamardan and Malangtuli mines for Posco has dashed the hopes of many steel companies like Essar, which was eyeing these deposits for its proposed projects. 

 On Thursday, Orissa mines minister Padmanabha Behera said the fresh blueprint for Poscos proposed steel plant at Paradip port would be sent to the company officials by this weekend. Behera indicated that the MoU may be signed next week once it is cleared by Posco. 

 In another development, the Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation of the state has written to the Jagatsinghpur district administration to reserve about 3000 acres at Jatadhar river mouth near Paradip port for the proposed plant. Although the Essar group was eyeing the land, the state government seems to be more keen on allotting it to Posco.

 The states preferential treatment to Posco has caused a lot of heartburn among potential investors who are willing to set up steel plants in the state. Many investors like Essar are sore over the fact that the government has reserved two mines for Posco, while they were being kept in the dark about their iron ore mines.

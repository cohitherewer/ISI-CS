 Field gets uneven for fair-play cops

 Grid-lock

 New Delhi, Aug. 14: India celebrates its 59th Independence Day tomorrow, but it is a trifle ironical that this is also the time when the independence of two major regulators ? the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) and the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) ? has come under attack.

 The two regulators were touted as symbols of the economic reforms that swept the country in the 1990s. Their roles as independent regulators were supposedly indicative of how keen the government was to cede its overarching powers.

 But there is now a groundswell of protest from the legislature, consumers and companies to trammel the powers of the regulators.

 A close examination of their functions reveal that there was a problem in their genesis, which could not be resolved even after many amendments. 

 Regulatory institutions are not sacrosanct. They should be responsive to the market dynamics and reflective of the aspirations of consumers and policy makers. But to tame them to meet vested individual and political interests is not a path that a free India should adopt. 

 While the pressure is on from all stakeholders to remove Trai chairman Pradeep Baijal, there are growing political compulsions to clip the tariff-setting powers of the electricity regulator.

 Operators ? both private and government-owned ? and the elected representatives are up in arms against Baijal continuing in office. The attack on the individual may be justified, but it unfortunately tarnishes the image of the institution that is supposed to evoke trust and confidence.

 ?Today nine out of 10 directives given by Trai is challenged. He is also accused of favouring one operator and trying to micro-manage the operations of telecom services. Domestic and foreign investors are paranoid to make commitments,? the executive said. 

 Nilotpal Basu, CPI(M) leader, had launched an attack on Baijal and sought his removal. He is not the first to do so. S.S. Sodhi, the first Trai chief, was under fire for not allowing MTNL to offer mobile services, and was accused of lobbying for the cellular industry.

 The next chairman, M.S. Verma, was attacked by members of Parliament for reorganising the tariff that led to a hike in the monthly rental of fixed phones.

 The government, too, should realise that the raison d??tre of setting up a regulator would be lost if its powers are curbed in order to deal with political compulsions. 

 The political lobby is hard pressed to woo voters and thus want to curtail the tariff setting powers of the central and state electricity regulatory commissions. 

 The freedom to set power tariffs by the legislature was faulty since it had the flexibility to change rates to suit political requirements. This resulted in the financial mess of state electricity boards. Investment was not forthcoming from both domestic and foreign investors. Hence, it was decided to grant this power to a regulatory body. 

 However, political leaders realised that by relinquishing this power, they were in danger of jeopardising their careers. So under the garb of an amendment to the electricity act, state governments have pressed for a clause that will allow the legislature to intervene in the tariff-setting exercise.

 When our leaders set out to fight to get freedom from foreign rulers, they wanted ?poorna swaraj? or complete freedom. India is at the threshold of another tryst with destiny. It has to decide whether it needs a regulator to take forward the reform process it envisaged in 1991 or should the formidable lobby of political leaders, companies and consumers be permitted to set the rules of the game.

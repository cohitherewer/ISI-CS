 Headstart on living room

 Keep the room free of clutter and go for sleek 

furniture

The living room of your house is what establishes your taste for the world to see. It is the heart of your home. Contrary to popular belief, it doesn?t cost as much in terms of cash as it does in terms of your head to conceptualise and execute a living room to your liking. 

 The first choice one needs to make is whether to have a room that one feels like living in with individual identity strewn casually around or to have a room like a set piece.

 Think it through

 In terms of planning and space management of the living and dining areas, it is better to outline from the start all the elements that would go into it and provisionally budget for it. This helps in establishing the cost parameters as well as the design possibilities at the very outset as it is very easy to yield to temptation and spoil yourself when it comes to the living room! 

 If one has given the seating arrangement, display cabinets, upholstery, lighting and colour some amount of thought prior to commencement, situations like not having money left for that chandelier or that curtain can be avoided.

 Experiment tips 

 Give the room your identity and around that think of the furniture. Experiment with ease by placing a bean bag beside a lounge sofa; floor cushions beside a corner table with a lamp hung from the ceiling. 

 Seating can be provided in myriad ways, beginning with the typical sofa set with a centre table to a mixed seating arrangement comprising different types of seats. 

 The thumb rule is to carefully estimate the maximum number of people that would probably come together in the space and provide that level of seating after considering the spill provided by the additional dining chairs.

 Display of collectibles from your life, photographs, curios, books etc. needs cabinets or simple wall brackets with glass shelves. If your lifestyle has the TV in the living area, then a trolley or a multipurpose cabinet would be called for. 

 Don?t forget the guest

 This is also the room which is the extended guestroom, so that an extra mattress or futon or the sofa-cum-bed option could be considered. 

 Keeping the room crisp and free of clutter is the challenge as bulky cabinets and sofas make rooms look even smaller and are difficult to move around in case things need to be rearranged for a children?s party.

 A dining table that folds and becomes the shutter of the cabinet behind is a very common and useful space-saving measure. Bulky pelmets are out and sleek powder coated (wrought iron) curtain rods with designer ends are in. 

 An important issue that underlines the arrangements in the living room is durability of the materials used as they will be abused, especially the upholstery. 

 The right colour?

 What knits it all together is colour ? so paint that wall a dark shade ? add a border and you don?t have to have a white ceiling. Lighting is what gives character so if you?ve given your heart to doing up the room only to put a tubelight, the chances are things will all look flat. Lots of people are known to design the room around an interesting kind of lamp. The lighting should flow with the mood.

 There are many readymade options available today which makes doing up the living room much easier than before. In fact, visiting furniture shops, auction houses and lifestyle stores and mixing and matching with the stuff available makes the friendly neighbourhood carpenter almost redundant.

 The price, please

 Budgets would start with around Rs 50,000 and for these spaces the sky is truly the limit as a single lamp could cost you above a few lakhs. 

 It?s fun and can get extremely acrimonious with the husband and kids wanting to have their say. What better way to put the stamp of your identity on the space being created.

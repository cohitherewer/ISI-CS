 IOC keen on petrochem hub

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, Nov. 19: Indian Oil Corporation is keen to invest in the proposed petrochemicals hub in Haldia, chairman Sarthak Behuria told Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today. 

 During his meeting with Bhattacharjee, Behuria discussed IOCs plan of setting up a petrochemicals hub in Haldia, where the oil PSU has a refinery. Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen and finance minister Asim Dasgupta were also present. 

 The oil major had earlier announced plans for setting up a Rs 5,000-crore petrochemicals hub in the region.

 On Haldia Petrochemicals, Behuria said the issue was not discussed at the meeting. The matter is under the Company Law Board now and the decision will be taken by them, he said.

 IOC had picked up a 7.5 per cent stake in HPL after paying Rs 150 crore and has asked for a directorial berth on the board.

 The Union ministry of chemicals and fertilisers has proposed a mega chemical hub at Haldia. At present, a feasibility study is being carried out and the impact on environment assessed. Well set up a chemical industry hub at Haldia and we want big investment from PSUs like Indian Oil, said industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen. 

 We have, however, asked IOC to invest in chemicals independent of their interest in HPL. Once the viability of the chemicals industry at Haldia is established and public investment comes in, we will have no problem wooing private investors. IOC officials assured us that theyll examine the proposal and get a study done on this project, Sen said.

 Mott McDonald is doing the feasibility study for the petrochem hub. Apart from Bengal, the Union chemicals and fertiliser ministry has identified Dahej in Gujarat as another prospective spot for the hub.

 The Bengal government has earmarked around 20,000 acres of land on both sides of the Haldi river, for which it will seek special economic zone (SEZ) status from the Centre. 

 Profit watch

 IOC hopes to maintain last years profit level of Rs 4891 crore in the current fiscal even after absorbing the steep rises in the crude prices and the subsequent volatility in the market.

 Addressing newspersons here today IOC chairman said, We will get nearly Rs 6000 crore out of the Rs 11,500 crore oil bonds that the government is expected to issue.

 Prices amp; profits to steer Wall Street 

 Los Angeles, Jan. 3: Its 2005 on the calendar, but what year will this be on Wall Street? 

 Some investment pros are thinking about 1994, when the Federal Reserve began to slowly raise short-term interest rates, then sharply stepped up the pace of credit tightening ? to the bond markets horror. 

 Others are thinking back to 1977. In 1973 and 74, the stock market suffered its worst decline since the Great Depression, only to snap back in 1975 and 76. (Sound familiar?) But high hopes for 1977 were dashed by rising inflation. The Dow Jones industrial average fell into another bear market that year. 

 Or maybe this will be just like all other mid-decade years: Since 1915, every year ending in five has been positive for stocks, and in all but one of those years the Dow Jones industrial average rose by more than 20 percent. 

 Investors typically feel a mix of hope and anxiety at the start of each January. Last year at this time, however, hope probably exceeded anxiety for many people because stocks had rebounded dramatically, the Fed still seemed a long way from raising interest rates and there was no talk of a crisis for the US dollar. 

 By contrast, as 2005 dawns, many investors may wonder how their portfolios made it through 2004 in such reasonably good shape ? and whether their luck will hold out in the new year. 

 Last year, the Fed started raising rates for the first time since 2000, the price of oil soared, the dollar plummeted and insurgents in Iraq took a heavy toll on US and Iraqi security forces. Yet every major US stock market index posted gains for the year. So did most foreign equity markets. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average added a modest 3.2 per cent to end the year at 10,783.01. But the underachieving Dow was a poor proxy for the rest of the market. 

 The Standard amp; Poors 500 index rose 9 per cent, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite gained 8.6 per cent. Indexes of smaller stocks fared even better: The S amp;P small-cap index surged 21.6 per cent. 

 As for bonds, long-term interest rates were amazingly restrained even as the Fed raised its benchmark short-term rate five times. The result: Most bond mutual funds had positive total returns (interest earnings plus or minus principal change). 

 Can 2005 top that? 

 That may depend on two major factors, and an assortment of wild cards: 

 Major factor No. 1: Inflation. Its up. And if the trend continues in 2005, inflation could be the most important determinant of what happens in financial markets. In the first 11 months of 2004, the governments consumer price index rose at a 3.7 percent annual rate, nearly double the 1.9 percent rise for all of 2003. 

 Major factor No. 2: Corporate earnings. Nearly everybody on Wall Street figures earnings growth will slow in 2005. In fact, profit growth has been slowing since the first quarter of 2004. 

 Yet the stock market went up last year. Bullish investors think the same can happen in 2005, even if profit gains decelerate further, and even if the Fed keeps raising interest rates.

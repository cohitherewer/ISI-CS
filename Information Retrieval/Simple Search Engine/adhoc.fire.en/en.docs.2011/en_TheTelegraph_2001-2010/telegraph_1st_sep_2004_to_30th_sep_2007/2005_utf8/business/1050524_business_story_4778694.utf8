 Alarm bells at BSNL call booths

 ALOKANANDA GHOSH

 Wrong number

 Calcutta, May 23: BSNL call booth operators are a worried lot. 

 Now that the three metros ? Calcutta, Chennai and Mumbai ? and their respective states have come under the local mobile call rate loop along with the Uttar Pradesh east and west circles, BSNL booth operators fear customers may have little reason to come to them to make long-distance calls. Instead of flocking to these booths, customers might as well make calls to mobile numbers within the state from their personal mobiles or land lines since local rates apply. 

 Moreover, even if a customer dials a long-distance mobile number from the booth, the operator will not get the Rs 2 service tax earlier charged on calls made to other parts of the state. 

 Around 90 per cent of the calls made from PCOs are to mobile phones. On an average, around 200 local calls are made per day, while the long distance component is between 80-100 units, of which around 60-70 are calls are made within the state. 

 Booth operators stand to lose the Rs 2 service charge on the 60-70 calls beyond the city limits. 

 According to the current tariff, a local call made from a PCO to a fixed line costs Rs 1.20 for a 90-second call. Calls from a PCO to a Hutch or AirTel subscriber costs Rs 1.20 for a 45-second pulse. Calls to a BSNL mobile is charged on a 60-second pulse. 

 The telecom ministrys recent decision is a major blow to booth operators who are already hit by the aggressive tactics of private operators like Tata Teleservices and Reliance Infocomm. BSNL booth operators get a 25-35 per cent commission based on units billed, while private operators give 40 per cent. The investment in the case of private operators is also significantly low varying between Rs 1000 and Rs 10,000 against Rs 25,000 in the case of BSNL.

 The All India STD/ISD Booth Owners Welfare Association plans to go on an indefinite strike next month or give up the BSNL service in favour of private operators if their demands are not met. The operators will place their demands before S. K. Bhaduri, general manager (customer service) of Calcutta Telephones, tomorrow. Bhaduri was not available for comment.

 BSNL has around 17.5 lakh public call booths across the country. Of this, 31,000 are in Calcutta and 1.97 lakh in the Bengal circle. 

 Booth owners added that because of the frequent changes in tariff they have to spend between Rs 700-1000 on upgrading their billing machines. BSNL sources, however, said this was incorrect as the machines billed according to the changes in pulse rates.

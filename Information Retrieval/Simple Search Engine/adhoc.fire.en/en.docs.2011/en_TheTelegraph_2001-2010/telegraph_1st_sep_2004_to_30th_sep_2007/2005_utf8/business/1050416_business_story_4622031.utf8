 Calcutta, April 15: City-based Anupam Technologies has commenced BPO activities with a 110-seat contact centre at Salt Lake. 

 The contact centre will serve as a base for telemarketing various services offered by telecom companies, mainly in the the UK and the US. 

 The group, which has a presence in the paints market, offers web solutions through Anupam Infotech, which was set up in 1999. Anupam Technologies is the infotech-enabled service (ITeS) arm of the group.

 Anupam Kedia, managing director of Anupam Technologies, said, ?The centre will mainly generate outbound sales calls to sell mobile connections and services for UK-based companies 3G, TMobile and others. We have also entered into an agreement with US-based DirectTV to market satellite dish antennas and the 150 channels that it distributes.?

 The utilised capacity per shift currently is 57. The company is also evaluating the potential in developed telecom markets like Australia and is likely to tie up with a leading operator soon.

 Speaking on revenue prospects, Kedia said, ?We will be getting ?60 per sale per agent. The revenue generating potential with more than 50 seats in each shift is immense. We have a compulsory target of two sales per shift for a single process. There are four processes running.?

 The company also plans to ramp up operations over the next two months with 60 more seats being added by June this year.

 ?We plan to increase the number of seats to 300 within the next two months. This will take the total investment to Rs 4 crore. We have already completed hiring people in the mid-management level and currently have 70 employees,? Kedia added.

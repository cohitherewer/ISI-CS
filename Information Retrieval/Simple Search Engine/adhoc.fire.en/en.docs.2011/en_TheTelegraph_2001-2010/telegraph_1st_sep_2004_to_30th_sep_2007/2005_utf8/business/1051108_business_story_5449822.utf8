 Nath bid to put trade talks on fast track

 Nath: Vocal

 London, Nov. 7 (PTI): India today said development issues must occupy the centrestage for the success of the Doha round of trade negotiations and criticised the attempts of the developed nations to push real issues to the background with barely a month left for the WTO ministerial meeting. 

 In a letter to 148 member nations of WTO, Indias commerce minister Kamal Nath said without glossing over the critical aspects our endeavour should be to ensure success and the WTO ministerial meet in Hong Kong in middle of December. Or else there will be no success. WTO is not about free trade alone, he said.

 Releasing a copy of the letter at a news conference here, Nath said there was hardly a month left for the Hong Kong ministerial and yet the real issues remained clouded or were being pushed to the background.

 Underlining the importance of agriculture for developing countries like India, he said farm sector was not commerce for them as was the case for the developed countries.

 So, the demand of some of the members for real market access in agriculture was untenable as it undermined the policy-space for the developing countries.

 Nath is here to participate in the crucial G-4 meeting to break the impasse in the WTO talks.

 Cautioning that the trade negotiations launched at Doha was called development round and not a market access round, Nath said any agreement should make special and differential treatment for developing countries as integral to all aspects of the negotiations. 

 The minister said India remained committed to the G-20 offer of October 12 this year, which called for proportionately lower commitments by developing countries than those by the developed countries.

 He also welcomed the proposal of the Afro-Carribean countries, which had come forward with a generous offer despite their known capacity constraints.

 On Non-agricultural Market Access (Nama), he expressed concern over some recent proposals suggesting norms for tariff reduction from applied rates. Nath said these were totally extraneous to the mandate and rejected any single co-efficient formula for developed and developing countries as a complete non-starter.

 Commenting on the slow progress of the services negotiations, he said the architecture of GATS (General Agreement on Trade Services) provided flexibility to developing countries to undertake commitments in services sector according to their ability and needs. The minister said the proposals based on quantitative targets on a one-size-fits-all basis were not acceptable. 

 Nath said developing countries had sought amendments in the TRIPS agreement to prevent piracy of biological material (bio-piracy) and to prevent misappropriation of their traditional knowledge.

 US interest rates harden

 Washington, Feb. 3 (Reuters): The US Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised interest rates for a sixth straight time, extending a policy of gradually lifting borrowing costs to levels high enough to ward off inflation pressures.

 The unanimous decision by the US central bank?s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee moves the target for the benchmark federal funds rate ? which affects credit costs throughout the economy ? to 2.5 per cent.

 In a statement after a two-day meeting, Fed officials retained an assessment that economic risks were balanced between slower growth and rising prices and said they thought they could keep raising rates at a ?measured? pace.

 A poll of 19 Wall Street primary dealers, conducted after the Fed statement was published, found them unanimously predicting another quarter percentage point rate hike at the next FOMC meeting on March 22. Eighteen foresaw an additional incremental rate rise at the following session on May 3.

 The central bank?s wording on the economy all but mirrored the statement it issued at its last policy meeting on December 14.

 ?Output appears to be growing at a moderate pace, despite the rise in energy prices and labour market conditions continue to improve gradually,? the Fed said in the statement outlining its rate decision, which also increased the largely symbolic discount rate a matching amount to 3.5 per cent.

 The Fed action comes two weeks before Fed chairman Alan Greenspan?s testimony on the economy on February 16-17 to Senate and US House of Representatives panels, respectively. Analysts said that was likely one reason the statement and the meeting outcome were so predictable.

 ?I don?t think they would have wanted to pre-empt anything before then,? said John Daw, a currency strategist with Merrill Lynch in New York. ?They can talk about changes then rather than have speculation build up prior to then.?

 The FOMC held a discussion about a numerical target for inflation ? a practice Greenspan has resisted during his 18-year tenure but that many other central banks use. With Greenspan scheduled to retire next year, the topic may gain momentum and draw questions from lawmakers about whether it might be useful for the United States to consider moving to such a system under a new Fed leader.

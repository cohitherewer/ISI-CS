 Birlas knock on court door again

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, May 6: The Birlas today filed an application in Calcutta High Court against its earlier order rejecting the caveatable interest of three members of the countrys first business family in connection with the legal authentication of Priyamvada Birlas last testament. 

 Justice Kalyanjyoti Sengupta, who was hearing the case, had passed an order on March 11 in which he discarded the plea of three key members of the Birla family ? Krishna Kumar, Basant Kumar and Yashovardhan ? that they had an interest in the will of Priyamvada. 

 The court had ruled that only G. P. Birla would have a legal role in connection with Rajendra Singh Lodhas probate application to authenticate the will, executed in 1999.

 According to Lodha, Priyamvada made him the sole beneficiary of the assets of the MP Birla group, a claim the Birla family has collectively challenged in the court. 

 With the Birlas challenging the March 11 order, the inheritance controversy is all set to take a new legal turn. The appeal of the three Birlas is likely to come up for hearing before a division bench sometime next week. 

 The sisters of MP Birla ? Laxmi Bai Newar and Radha Devi Mohatta ? also moved an application today in the high court seeking permission to break open some of the safes ? keys of which are not available ? in the couples residences in Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta. 

 Lawyers representing Lodha had also submitted before the court about the non-availability of keys and the consequent problems in preparing an inventory of assets. 

 Justice Sengupta had earlier appointed four special officers to prepare an inventory of household assets of Priyamvada in her houses in Calcutta, Delhi, Mumbai and Allahabad.

 New Delhi, April 26: Now own a mobile phone for just Rs 1,700.

 Communications minister Dayanidhi Maran today unveiled a low-cost mobile phone manufactured by Motorola.

 Maran urged the mobile phone manufacturers to bring down prices further when the volumes go up.

 Speaking at the inaugural session of the Cellular Summit 2005 organised by the Cellular Operators Association of India (Coai), Maran said more than 1.5 billion subscribers spend over $1 trillion each year on mobile phone services.

 Maran said, ?The consumer adoption of the mobile phone is the fastest and the most spectacular technology adoption rate the world has ever seen. Growth in mobile phone subscribers has been fierce and swift.?

 ?Just 20 years after the launch of the world?s first commercial mobile services, there are more cellphone users than fixed-line ones globally. Nearly as many people have mobiles as televisions,? Maran said.

 The minister also highlighted the 85 per cent per annum compounded annual growth rate during the last six years by mobile operators. He also commended the continuous fall in mobile tariffs over the past four years.

 He also highlighted the findings of a study by Leonard Waverman of the London Business School released in February this year to stress the importance of mobile phones in the growth of gross domestic produce (GDP) of a country.

 ?The study found that in a developing country, mobile telephony has a positive and significant impact on economic growth and this impact may be twice as large in a developing country as in developed ones,? said Maran.

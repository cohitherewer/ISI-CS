 Maruti profit races ahead 

 Picking up speed 

 May 6 (PTI): Maruti Udyog Ltd, the countrys largest carmaker, has posted its highest sales last year since it began operations more than two decades ago. The company sold 5,36,301 units, including exports of 48,899 units, in 2004-05. 

 Riding on the back of an impressive sales performance, the companys earnings leaped 65 per cent during the fourth quarter of 2004-05. Cost cutting measures as well as improvement in productivity also aided the surge in profit as it absorbed higher input costs.

 ?Higher sales and the success of our in-house productivity improvement programme has boosted our bottomline. With higher localisation and aggressive cost reduction by our suppliers, we were able to absorb some of the adverse impact of higher input costs,? said managing director Jagdish Khattar, whose term has been extended by another three years.

 Marutis net profit during the reporting quarter rose to Rs 259.45 crore from Rs 157.15 crore in the year ago period, the carmaker said. Total income (net of excise) increased 9.3 per cent to Rs 3,142.10 crore against Rs 2,874.70 crore in the corresponding previous quarter.

 The board of directors has recommended a final dividend of Rs 2 per share (nominal value of Rs 5 per share) aggregating Rs 57.78 crore for 2004-05.

 Net profit for 2004-05 grew 57.44 per cent to Rs 853.63 crore compared with Rs 542.18 crore a year ago. Total income stood at Rs 11,353.87 crore, up 19.68 per cent from previous years Rs 9,486.62 crore.

 The consolidated net profit of the company rose 56.9 per cent to Rs 880.14 crore compared with Rs 560.94 crore in 2003-04. Total income increased to Rs 11,498 crore from Rs 9,597.66 crore in the previous fiscal.

 Risk service provider faces closure threat

 New Delhi, Dec. 26: Loss Prevention Association of India (LPA), the countrys premier risk management service provider, may be folded up. 

 A decision to this effect was taken by LPA board members nearly six months ago, though. We are in discussion with our lawyers to file a petition to this effect in the high court. It may take a month or two. A scheme of absorption will be prepared for the employees, said Sudesh Kapoor, secretary, LPA.

 LPA will be closed down as a separate entity and its workers, shunted to a separate unit of the state run General Insurance Corporation.

 M. Ramadoss, chairman of Oriental Insurance, one of the four public sector insurance firms which got together to form LPA, said, It has not been performing its original functions for quite sometime now. The primary reason is that all corporate houses have become pro-active with their individual risk management services. There is really no need for a stand alone entity.

 However, another reason being cited for the decision is that LPA is unable to generate income sufficient enough to pay even its employees.

 The 70-75 odd employees working in the Association will be mostly absorbed by GIC, while a few may also be taken in by the other three state-run non-life insurance companies. 

 While the four public sector insurance companies, the guarantor-members of LPA, have until now helped meet the shortfall, they are not ready to do so anymore.

 After the opening up of the insurance sector, the PSUs are facing competition and their expenditure has gone up. They are not willing to fork out more money for LPA, said an official of the Association. 

 LPA offers risk management services aimed at identifying risks to which manufacturing and business houses are exposed. It also suggests appropriate risk control and transfer strategies. The organisation has been engaged in promoting safety and loss control through education, training and consultancy in India and abroad.

 The Loss Prevention Association was formed in 1978 by GIC and the erstwhile four insurance subsidiaries namely ? National Insurance, Oriental Insurance, New India Assurance and United India.

 GICHF rights issue

 GIC Housing Finance, promoted by the state-run General Insurance Corporation of India, State Bank of India and others, today said it has approved a rights issue in the ratio of 1:1. The company board has approved the issue of one rights share for every share held by the shareholders, GIC Housing Finance said.

 The firm was incorporated in 1989 with the objective of providing shelter to all in view of the National Housing Policy announced by the government.

 Push to faster payment systems

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 3: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today said a new institution for facilitating retail payment systems will be set up in the current financial year.

 The plan is laid out in a vision document for payment and settlement systems. It sets definite milestones over the next three years and emphasises the need for creation of a sound legal base for payments and regulations.

 An RBI release said the new institution will be a limited company, owned by banks, and would act as an umbrella organisation for retail clearing operations ? paper-based and digital deals. 

 Apart from starting robust technology intensive electronic credit system and electronics funds transfer facility, the institution will initiate measures on converting the existing MICR cheque processing systems to truncation-based clearing, the RBI said.

 The new system will facilitate centralised settlement of all clearing transactions, the RBI said, adding all payment settlements in Mumbai, Chennai, Calcutta and Delhi would be done in the new way by December. Expansion of the real time gross settlement system and electronics payments products will be hastened too. The electronics funds transfer facility will be available at 10,000 branches in 500 cities by March next year.

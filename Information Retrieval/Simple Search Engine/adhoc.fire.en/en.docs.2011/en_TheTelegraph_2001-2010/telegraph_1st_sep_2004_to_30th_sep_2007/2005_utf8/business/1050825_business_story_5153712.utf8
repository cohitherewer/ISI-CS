 Recast rush in Ford home run

 Detroit, Aug. 24 (Reuters): Ford Motor Co will soon announce a new restructuring plan to return its key North American vehicle operations to profitability, chairman and chief executive Bill Ford Jr. said.

 I would say before fall gets too old, the family scion told reporters when asked about the timing of the announcement. The automaker has said it is working on more restructuring actions to halt steep losses in its North American business.

 Strong competition, soaring health-care and raw material costs, and a slide in US market share forced Ford Motor to cut its profit forecast twice this year. Fords North American operations swung to a pretax loss of $1.21 billion, including charges, in the second quarter.

 It will encompass a lot of things, an affordable business structure ... some new things we are going to announce that will surprise people positively, Bill Ford said, referring to the restructuring plan.

 It will be really, in my mind, a rather comprehensive announcement, he added. He declined to be more specific.

 Ford, speaking to reporters in Detroit after an address to business leaders where he paid tribute to departing Chrysler Group CEO Deiter Zetsche who is heading back to Germany to lead DaimlerChrysler, said the company has not decided on a date for the announcement yet, but he indicated it would not be before October.

 Ford has not ruled out deeper job cuts in Fords salaried work force or the closing of manufacturing plants.

 For tipsters, Wall Street now wears a deserted look

 Bleak days

 New York, Jan. 11: Wall Street analysts, the high-rolling share tipsters who found fame and fortune during the Internet boom, have seen their pay slashed following an industry backlash.

 Although bankers and traders are celebrating high annual bonuses thanks to a boom in the financial sector last year, analysts are increasingly looking like poor cousins.

 According to research by Whitney Group, a firm of New York headhunters, the pay of a senior share analyst on Wall Street has halved from $1.5 million in the glory year of 1999.

 Back then, analysts who claimed to understand telecom or Internet companies were in high demand, both at banks and by the media.

 They could also earn multi-million-dollar bonuses for bringing in deals to investment bankers with whom they had strong ties.

 After New York attorney general Eliot Spitzer accused top analysts of issuing fraudulent research that was biased in favour of clients, Wall Street agreed to new rules that separated the deal-making and share-tipping arms.

 Analysts have since been barred from working on mergers and are advised to keep careful records of every conversation with banking colleagues.

 Once a source of revenue for banks and therefore highly valued, analysts are now regarded as being unable to pay their way.

 Manny Goldman, a veteran analyst for Sanford Bernstein and Paine Webber, told Bloomberg News: ?The golden age for analysts is over. It?s not much fun anymore.?

 When Wall Street collectively paid $1.4 billion to settle allegations that its share tips were biased and agreed to strong walls between analysts and bankers, the industry hoped it would lead to higher quality research.

 Instead, it seems that big banks are simply producing less research. According to Sanford Bernstein, the budget for share analysis at the seven biggest stockbrokers fell 40 per cent to $1.5 billion last year. Many analysts were fired and not replaced.

 There were already some firms that did no investment banking but survived purely through selling investors detailed information on companies, but the revenues do not compare to advising on takeovers.

 According to Bloomberg, there has been a huge drop in the number of business school graduates looking to become analysts. During the dotcom boom, Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch and Mary Meeker of Morgan Stanley became the king and queen of the Internet with bullish tips predicting huge success for Amazon.com and others.

 Blodget was fined $4 million and barred from the stockbroking industry after it emerged that he had privately derided shares he was punting to the public. He has since tried journalism.

 Meeker is still at Morgan Stanley and issuing research reports, but her profile is low.

 Jack Grubman, perhaps the most famous analyst ever, was fined $15 million and banned from the industry after being accused by Spitzer of fraud. He did not admit or deny wrongdoing.

 A former stock market tipster called Thom Calandra is to pay $540,000 to settle charges that he profited from selling shares, which he had tipped in his newsletter.

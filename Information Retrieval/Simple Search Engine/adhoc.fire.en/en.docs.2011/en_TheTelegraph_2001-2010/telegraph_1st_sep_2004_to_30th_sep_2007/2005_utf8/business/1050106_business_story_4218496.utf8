 US rate concerns weigh on world markets

 Jan. 5 (Reuters): Stocks eased worldwide on Wednesday after minutes released from the US Federal Reserve?s December meeting fuelled concerns that interest rates may have to rise faster than previously expected to contain inflation.

 ?The FOMC minutes showed the Fed in a more hawkish light than the market had generally perceived them to be,? said Jason Simpson, a bond strategist at ABN AMRO in London. ?They said they were pretty much unconcerned by growth. Bottom line interest rates are too low.?

 A patchy report on the state of the euro zone?s dominant service sector did little to improve sentiment in Europe, where stock indices pulled back from multi-year highs.

 The FTSE 100 index of leading shares was down 36 points at 4,811 ? handing back all of Tuesday?s rally. 

 Technology stocks were also down sharply in the wake of an overnight 2 per cent fall in the Nasdaq Composite Index, although European software firms trimmed losses. 

 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 7.25 points at 10638.03 in early trading.

 Hong Kong blue-chip stocks fell 2 per cent on Wednesday as investors offloaded shares amid fears of higher interest rates after hawkish comments from the US Federal Reserve. The city?s interest rates are tied to US movements and usually follow in tandem as the local currency is pegged to the greenback.

 The Hang Seng Index, which gained 13 per cent in 2004, closed down 281.54 points, at 13,764.36, a level last seen in early November. The benchmark gauge has fallen by more than 3 per cent in the last two days. Turnover was heavy with HK$28 billion ($3.6 billion) changing hands compared with HK$21 billion on Tuesday.

 In Japan, Tokyo?s Nikkei lost 0.70 per cent or 80.23 points to 11,437.52. Chip-related stocks such as Tokyo Electron Limited suffered losses like their US peers after a brokerage downgrade for computer maker Dell Inc.

 Recent gainers such as banks and brokerages met profit-taking amid market concern about a possible rise in US rates. 

 However, a consensus that Japan?s economy is still on a recovery path after a temporary slowdown and the view that any US rate hike would not squelch growth in the worlds largest economy curbed aggressive selling, analysts said.

 Oil awaits data

 Oil prices eased ahead of key U.S. reserves data at 1530 GMT which is expected to show a rise in supplies of heating fuels after a bout of unseasonably warm winter weather.

 quot;It really hasnt been a very cold winter and that will hurt short-term demand, quot; said Tony Nunan at Mitsubishi Corp. in Tokyo.

 quot;If todays stats are bearish well go down, but $40 to $45 continues to be a good range, quot; he said.

 US light crude was down almost 1 percent at around $43.50 a barrel, having spiked 4 per cent on Tuesday as further violence rocked Iraq. The price was about 20 percent below Octobers all-time highs.

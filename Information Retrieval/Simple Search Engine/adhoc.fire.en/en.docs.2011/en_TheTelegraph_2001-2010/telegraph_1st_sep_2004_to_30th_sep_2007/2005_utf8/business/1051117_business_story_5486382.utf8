 Mumbai, Nov. 16: Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd (VSNL) is also betting on the wireless technology. It plans to roll out 1000 hotspots across the country over the next few years.

 The rollout is part of its idea to offer more value-added services. However, company officials did not give details regarding the rollout programme or the investment that would go into it.

 Meanwhile, VSNL today joined hands with the Karnataka State Cricket Association to offer wi-fi services at the Chinnaswamy cricket stadium in Bangalore.

 According to the agreement, VSNL will offer Tata Indicom wi-fi service for five years at the stadium. The service will be launched on November 19 during the second ODI between India and South Africa and will be available at the club house, guest rooms, conference halls and also at the corporate boxes and press enclosure at the stadium.

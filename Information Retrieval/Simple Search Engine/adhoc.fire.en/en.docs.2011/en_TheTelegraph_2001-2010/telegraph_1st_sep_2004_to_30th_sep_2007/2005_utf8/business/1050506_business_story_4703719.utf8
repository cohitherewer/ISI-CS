 Payout can go up to 40% of net profit

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, May 5: Banks can pay dividends up to 40 per cent of net profit, provided they fulfil a minimum capital adequacy ratio of 9 per cent for three years and keep bad loans under 7 per cent, the Reserve Bank said today. 

 The move comes at a time when banks are increasingly eyeing the primary markets to raise capital. 

 ?This is a clear move to help weaker banks raise capital,? said a senior banker affiliated to a leading private sector bank. New shareholders will only be interested if they are given a carrot in the form of regular dividends. This was not the case earlier as many banks would not have met the grade on dividends in view of the tough norms set by the RBI.

 The move to hike the dividend ratio to 40 per cent from the earlier 33.33 per cent came with more sweeteners. The capital adequacy ratio, which was earlier pegged at 11 percent, has been scaled down to 9 per cent and the bad loan ratio has been hiked to 7 per cent from 3 per cent earlier.

 Weak banks can now plan dividends and attract investors to become shareholders by virtue of a good yield ratio. Banks will not need a prior approval of the RBI for payment of dividend when they are within new norms.

 The new guidelines will be applicable to the dividends declared for the year ended March 31 onwards, the RBI said in a notification today.

 If a bank violates the guidelines, it would be viewed very seriously and would attract penal action under section 46 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, the RBI warned. 

 The dividend payout ratio would be calculated as a percentage of dividend payable in a year, excluding dividend tax, to net profit during the year.

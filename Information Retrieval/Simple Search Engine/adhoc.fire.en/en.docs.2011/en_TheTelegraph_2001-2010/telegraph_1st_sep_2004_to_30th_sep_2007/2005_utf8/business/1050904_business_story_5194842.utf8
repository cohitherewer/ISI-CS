 Ranbaxy mulls US listing

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Sept. 3: Ranbaxy Laboratories today said it will consider listing its securities on a US bourse.

 Ranbaxys board of directors will meet on September 9 to discuss matters relating to listing of the securities in the US, conversion of existing GDRs into ADRs and raising of resources through appropriate securities, Ranbaxy has informed the Bombay Stock Exchange. 

 The company, which market sources insist is still in the reckoning to acquire US-based Alpharma, has on several occasions indicated its desire to grow inorganically in the developed markets.

 Promoters Malvinder Mohan Singh and Shivender Mohan Singh have in the past hinted at buyout plans abroad. Listing on US bourses may help this plan. 

 Many of the acquisitions abroad are through stock swaps without much cash component involved.

 Ranbaxy has over six crore shares representing 32.28 per cent of the total equity capital with foreign investors. Market experts say the listing will allow foreign investors adequate liquidity.

 Ranbaxy promoters own 35.10 per cent of the equity. The pharma company has recently sold its allied business portfolio, which consisted of fine chemicals business, a part of the diagnostics business and animal healthcare business.

 ICICI Venture Funds Management Company Limited (ICICI Venture), a leading private equity and venture fund management company, bought out Ranbaxys allied business portfolio. 

 The transaction will be subject to receipt of requisite regulatory and shareholder approvals and is expected to be closed by the end of this year.

 Earlier this week, Ranbaxy CEO and managing director Brian W. Tempest said the deal is in line with the Ranbaxy vision of becoming a research-based international pharmaceutical company. 

 This will help Ranbaxy focus more on its core pharmaceutical business in future, Tempest said.

 Demerger tax liability negligible

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 18: The eventual demerger of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) shareholding into three companies, Reliance Infocomm, Reliance Energy and Reliance Capital has thrown up questions on whether the settlement would lead to payment of stamp duty or income tax.

 Tax experts contend that while the issue of stamp duty does arise,its payment can be entirely avoided if the shares to be transferred are held in demat form. Further, RIL will also not be subject to any tax since the Income Tax Act exempts a demerger process from tax.

 Under the final demerger plan, the groups flagship, RIL, will exit from Reliance Energy and Reliance Capital. RIL has a 45 per cent stake in Reliance Energy and a 47 per cent stake in Reliance Capital. Reliance Industries will also dissociate itself from Reliance Infocomm, where it holds 45 per cent equity. 

 It is expected that these shares will be held in a separate holding company, which will be controlled by Anil Ambani. Minority shareholders of RIL will also be able to obtain shares of this new entity.

 Speaking to The Telegraph, Anil Harish, advocate and partner of D M Harish amp; Company, said that while the issue of stamp duty does arise under the Mumbai Stamp Act, 1958, it would depend on the value of the assets and their locations. 

 He, however, added that the stamp duty payable in this case would be small since the deal involves only the transfer of shares. If they are held in demat form, this duty is not payable at all, he added.

 On the issue of payment of tax, Harish said that under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, tax would be not payable by RIL since the Income Tax Act exempts demerger from the tax purview. However, the issue of capital gains tax will arise for those shares that are personally held by Mukesh Ambani and are transferred to the younger brother. 

 Sources argued that this was also unlikely to happen as such a holding could be of a long term nature (holdings of more than a year are not subject to capital gains tax). It is unlikely that Mukesh Ambani will be holding these shares personally, they could be held through some holding companies, they said. they added.

 Aiyar puts Iran gas import on fast track

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 24: Petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar today held talks with senior officials of the National Iranian Gas Export Corporation to pave the way for the import of 5 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas, which has been stuck over the ticklish pricing issue.

 Aiyar told reporters after the meeting that he was satisfied with the progress of the talks and the agreement for the import of LNG would be signed soon. The quantity of imports is expected to go up to 7.5 million tonne in 2011, he added. The two countries are still engaged in hard bargaining over the oil-for-gas deal that links the purchase of LNG by India to participating in exploration and production in Iranian oilfields.

 Since power and fertiliser plants require natural gas, it is vital for India to work out the gas price based on the electricity charges and fertiliser prices in the country.

 Iran is desperately seeking a market for its vast reserves of natural gas that do not have a buyer.

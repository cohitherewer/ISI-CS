 Institutions back Anils vision on twin ventures

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, June 20: Anil Ambanis vision for Reliance Energy and Reliance Capital seems to have impressed long-term institutional investors, who have already committed Rs 700 crore and Rs 1,000 crore, respectively, in the proposed preferential offer of both companies.

 Flagging off Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Enterprises (ADAE) yesterday, Anil said both companies were planning a preferential issue of shares to strengthen their financial position and generate long-term resources to speed up growth plans.

 Sources say they have received a positive feedback from institutional investors and consider this a reflection of their confidence in the growth plans being formulated by Anil.

 The preferential offer for Reliance Energy will be made at a minimum price of Rs 573 or higher. The decision on the offer was taken at a board meeting yesterday. ADAE will invest over Rs 1000 crore through the preferential offer in Reliance Energy.

 Speaking to reporters yesterday, Anil said that these companies had tremendous growth potential. Long-term investors and financial institutions were keen to be part of the energy, financial services and telecom businesses, he added.

 In Reliance Capital, Anil will invest Rs 2000 crore through the preferential offer. The offer, which comes at a minimum price of Rs 228 or higher, is also being made to long-term institutional investors.

 The Reliance Capital offer is expected to bring it among the top three companies in the private financial services and banking sector. 

 Anil had also indicated that the company would venture into banking, subject to regulatory approvals.

 Dominos bets on desi flavours

 Tasting time

 New Delhi, Nov. 27: American fast-food chain Dominos Pizza plans to top up its offerings with desi flavours to suit Chettinad and Goan tastes.

 We are constantly researching on new products and how they can be made more likeable to local consumers. For instance, research is being made on products such as chettinad chicken pizzas and sambar flavoured ones, Dominos Pizza India CEO Ajay Kaul told The Telegraph.

 The company is also examining the possibility of dishing out region-specific products. There could be products with a tinge of Goan prawn curry for the western and coastal belts. For the southern part, the pizza toppings could be based on popular local delicacies such as chicken 65, he said.

 Kaul, however, did not specify the time when these products will be included in the menu. I cannot give you a timeframe right now. It is a continuous process and depends entirely on customer acceptability.

 Most international food chains have had to change their standard international menu to suit local tastes. Some of them even dished out snacks such as samosas to attract customers.

 Dominos, however, does not intend to diversify from its core product category ? pizzas. We do not intend to serve burgers. Dominos essentially is a pizza serving company and we want to stay like that, he said.

 At present, around 35 per cent of the companys revenue as well as menu comprises Indianised products such as the popular peppy paneer pizzas. 

 Our strategy is not to compete with other food chains such as McDonalds, he said. However, Dominos has introduced a product called cheese burger pizza.

 The burger element is incidental. It is essentially a pizza with the experience of a burger, Kaul said, adding that the organised market in the pizza category is around Rs 275 crore.

 The company plans to increase its outlets.We intend to add between 20 and 25 stores every year over the next three years, he said.

 Dominos currently has 102 stores spread across 27 cities.

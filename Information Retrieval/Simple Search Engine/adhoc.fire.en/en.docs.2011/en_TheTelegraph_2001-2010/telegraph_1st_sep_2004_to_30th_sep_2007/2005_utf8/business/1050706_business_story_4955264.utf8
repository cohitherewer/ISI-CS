 Sanyo Electric to slash 14000 jobs

 Tokyo, July 5 (Reuters): Struggling Japanese electronics maker Sanyo Electric will cut 15 per cent of its global work force, shutter plants and halve debt in a sweeping restructuring to return to profit.

 Sanyo tracks rival consumer electronics makers having to undergo major restructuring amid intense price competition for televisions and other digital products. Sony Corp and Matsushita Electric Industrial Company are also cutting jobs.

 The overhaul comes after Japans third-largest consumer electronics maker suffered a big loss in fiscal 2004, hammered by earthquake damage to a chip factory and sluggish sales of core products such as digital cameras and mobile phones.

 The formidable challenge of reorganising Sanyos vast business interests falls on two executives, CEO Tomoyo Nonaka and president Toshimasa Iue, who got their jobs in a reshuffle of top management approved by shareholders last week.

 They billed the restructuring as the companys third birth following its founding in 1947 and a merger in 1986.

 We have to be ready to feel some pain under this new strategy, which marks the third start for Sanyo, Nonaka told a news briefing in Osaka, monitored by reporters in Tokyo.

 There will be no sacred cows in this restructuring, Iue said.

 The executive team vowed to focus on rechargeable batteries, solar cells and other areas where it has strong technology and a competitive advantage, while pulling out of businesses unable to produce an operating profit margin of at least 5 per cent.

 Sanyo said it will cut about 14000 jobs, including 8,000 in Japan where salaries are typically much higher than overseas. The company plans to cut 3,800 employees in Japan in 2005-06, the first year of the three-year plan through March 2008.

 It also vowed to close or sell the equivalent of 20 per cent of factory floor space in Japan, slash 70 billion yen ($627.1 million) in costs and cut 600 billion yen of its interest-bearing debt, which stood at a whopping 1.2 trillion yen on March 31.

 Shares in Sanyo, which have lost about one-third of their value in the past one year, ended up 0.34 per cent at 297 yen on Tuesday after having risen 5 per cent since a newspaper reported on Friday the company was planning for heavy job cuts.

 Sanyos semiconductor operations were hit hard when a major earthquake last October damaged a domestic factory. It is struggling to return its home appliances division to profit, and slowing growth in the digital camera market has also hurt.

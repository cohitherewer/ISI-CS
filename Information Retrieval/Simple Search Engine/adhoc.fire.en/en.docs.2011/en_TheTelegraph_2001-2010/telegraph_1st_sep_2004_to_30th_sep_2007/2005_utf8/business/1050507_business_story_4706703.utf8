 Calcutta, May 6: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) will soon set up a self-regulatory organisation (SRO) for general insurance in line with the Life Insurance Council.

 An SRO will help the process of detariffication of general insurance products, said Mathew Verghese, member (non-life) of IRDA. 

 ?They will accumulate the data and set the rate patterns accordingly,? he added.

 The executive committee of general council of IRDA would discuss the process of establishing the SRO, Verghese said while talking on the sidelines of a workshop on corporate risk and liability insurance organised by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry (BCCI).

 On corporate risk and liability insurance, Verghese said that insurance is becoming more complex by the year with technology sophistication, cross border acquisitions and trading. 

 He mentioned that though liberalisation has helped development of new products and insurance penetration, it is doubtful whether the sales force is well informed and equipped about the intricacies of the policies. This has also resulted in increase of complaints at IRDA and the ombudsmans office.

 ?In such a situation, the importance to meet the liability risks of our industries cannot be over emphasised. However, we are unable to meet such requirements locally in the absence of adequate underwriting and claims handling expertise. This results in transfer of such risks and the premium to global re-insurers and cannot be used for the long-term financial need of our country,? explained Verghese.

 Verghese said the authority would play a role in helping the insurers in rating the liability risks and developing innovative products.

 Bimalendu Chakrabarti, chairman and managing director of National Insurance Company, also emphasised on the need for proper assessment of risk and understanding of liability.

 He added that for the markets to evolve, it is extremely important to detariff the products and encourage free pricing.

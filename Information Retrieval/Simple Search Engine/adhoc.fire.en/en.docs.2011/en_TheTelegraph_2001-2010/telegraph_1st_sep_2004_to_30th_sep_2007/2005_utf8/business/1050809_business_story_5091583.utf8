 London, Aug. 8 (Reuters): Asia-focused bank Standard Chartered beat expectations with a 20 per cent rise in first-half profits on Monday and gave an upbeat outlook for the second half, sending its shares up 6 per cent.

 Pretax profit for the six months ended June 30 rose to $1.3 billion from $1.1 billion in the same period last year, aided by strong revenue growth and the first time inclusion of results from Korea First Bank, South Koreas seventh-largest bank, which Standard bought for $3.3 billion in April.

 Analysts had expected a pretax profit of $1.21 billion. However, forecasts were complicated by the introduction of the new IFRS accounting rules and the inclusion of KFB.

 On an underlying basis, which excludes one-off items and results from KFB, pretax profit rose 15 per cent on a 14 per cent rise in revenues.

 Including KFB, revenues rose 19 per cent to $3.24 billion and the charge for bad debts rose 40 per cent to $194 million. KFB accounted for more than half the increase in impairment losses.

 Standards stock was up 5.8 per cent at 1,190 pence.

 Headquartered in London, the banks operations are in Asia, where it makes around two-thirds of its profit, Africa and West Asia.

 The banks niche focus on companies and expanding middle classes in high-growth emerging markets has shielded it from a recent UK consumer slowdown, but increasingly pitches it against financial giants like Citigroup and HSBC, which are expanding in Asia amid slowing growth at home.

 Standard Chartereds attractiveness as a possible takeover target, its immunity from a rise in UK retail bad debts and the recent revaluation of Chinas currency have helped it to become the best-performing stock in the UK banking sector, rising about 13 per cent over the past six months.

 Dissent on WTO deal

 New Delhi, Dec. 19: The deal at the WTO ministerial summit in Hong Kong is under attack from within the government. Ministries feel that India has agreed to the Swiss formula of steep industrial tariff cuts and talks to open up its financial and banking sectors at a faster pace, without significant concessions on the farm front.

 India should have forced further delays in cutting industrial tariff or reworked the Swiss formula, which calls for reductions in the case of products with the steepest customs duties, a plan panel adviser told The Telegraph. These are usually products that are most vulnerable to foreign competition. This is why there is a strong wall to protect them, the official pointed out.

 Officials said the Indian delegation may face attack at home on this count not only from the usual Left and NGO opponents but also from various government departments which are not happy with the negotiations.

 In return, we did not even succeed in persuading Europeans to stick to the earlier deadline of 2010 for eliminating export subsidies ... the goalposts have been set back by three years, the official said. A section of the government is concerned that export subsidies, which are to be eliminated over eight years, are just $3 billion or less than 1 per cent of the total subsidy bill of $352 billion.

 India will have to cut tariff on 600 farm goods from 2008, while being able to protect about 50-80 products. While the product details are yet to be worked out, the fear is that for every line opened up, several hundred thousand farmers could be hit.

 The need to accelerate industrialisation of the rural hinterland through successful food processing chains is actually underlined by the deal ... if we cannot produce jobs for the farmers who will be thrown out of employment in the product lines which we open up, we could have more cases of farmers reduced to penury, officials said. 

 The inability of the government to gain anything immediately on the services front will also make the deal hard to defend at home, said officials. The Left parties have already criticised the deal on services, which will allow talks to open up health, education, financial services and telecom, possibly without any FDI caps.

 FDI caps have proved to be the big sticking point for this coalition government. The Congress government will have a tough time getting its allies to go along on this front, officials said.

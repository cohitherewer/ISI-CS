 NTPC eyes foreign coal mines

 Steady supply

 Calcutta, May 25: National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) is scouting for partners to acquire coal mines abroad.

 The buyouts will ensure a steady coal supply for its enhanced capacity of 9160 MW in the Tenth Plan Period. 

 NTPC, which has been ranked 486th on the Forbes list, is the countrys largest power generation company with an installed capacity of 23,749 MW. This includes 314 MW from the joint venture with SAIL. It has 13 coal-based, seven gas-based and three joint venture power plants. 

 NTPC sources said the state-run power utility is keen to acquire coal mines in Australia. Australia has mines that produce coal with a low ash content.

 In the Tenth Plan period, NTPC hopes to add 9,370 MW of capacity through nine projects, which entails a capital investment of Rs 60,000 crore. 

 The Rs 25,964-crore company, which accounts for 27 per cent of the power generated in India last year, wants to integrate itself.

 We are looking for partners to acquire coal mines abroad. Imported coal will become an important source of clean fuel for us, said a senior NTPC official. 

 The landed price of coal for power projects along the coast is lower than the cost of transporting it from mines to generation units situated in areas where power is sold. 

 Also, Indian coal has a high ash content, which is polluting and needs more processing. 

 NTPCs average tariff per unit is Rs 1.47 and this includes the more expensive gas-based power. The company plans to add another 20,000-megawatt (MW) capacity by 2012 and wants to ensure a long-term coal supply.

 The company has acquired a coal mine for captive use within India and is trying to buy more. But delays in the allocation of mines for captive use and the availability of only low-grade coal in India has forced NTPC to look at options abroad. 

 The company has teamed up with Gail to scout for natural gas blocks abroad. The two companies will send teams to Nigeria, Iran, Oman and Malaysia. 

 NTPC will also buy gas from Reliances find in the K-G basin off the eastern coast to ensure gas supplies within India.

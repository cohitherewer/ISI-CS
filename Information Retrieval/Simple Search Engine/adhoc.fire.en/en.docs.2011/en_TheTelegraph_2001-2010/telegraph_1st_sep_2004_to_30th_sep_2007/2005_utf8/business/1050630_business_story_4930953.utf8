 Calcutta, June 29: Mangalam Timber Ltd, the BK Birla group company, is expected to come out of the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) this year. It is also hoping to wipe out the entire accumulated loss in 2005-06. 

 The company went into the BIFR fold in 1998. In 2003-04, it had staged a turnaround by posting a meagre profit of Rs 0.48 crore. 

 Last year, the net profit increased to Rs 2.89 crore. The accumulated loss stood at Rs 6.41 crore, lower than Rs 19.90 crore in the previous fiscal, following adjustments of deferred tax assets of Rs 7.98 crore.

 G. S. Gupta, managing director of Mangalam Timber, said the BIFR would be approached once shareholders approve it in the annual general meeting scheduled in September.

 With the improved profitability, the company has decided to withdraw the proposal to reduce the share capital from Rs 10 per equity share to Rs 4. The board has decided to withdraw the proposal going by the improved financial situation. The approval will be sought at the AGM, he added.

 Gupta recalled that the company has returned from the brink of closure with support from principal promoter Kesoram Industries, banks and financial institutions (FIs). 

 Kesoram provided a lifeline of Rs 10 crore of unsecured loan to Mangalam Timber. FIs and banks have waived about Rs 15 crore loan and converted some loan to equity.

 The confidence of the principal promoter could be gauged from the fact that Kesoram is buying out Ipicols, the Orissa governments investment agency, 5.35 per cent stake in Mangalam Timber. It will offer Rs 20.31 per share, taking the total payout to Rs 1.99 crore.

 Gupta said various steps have been taken to improve the companys profitability.

 For instance, Mangalam Timber is focusing on plantation to secure raw material supply. The company will start getting timber from next fiscal. 

 In another four years, its entire requirement of 1-lakh tonne timber would be procured from its own plantations in Orissa, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh.

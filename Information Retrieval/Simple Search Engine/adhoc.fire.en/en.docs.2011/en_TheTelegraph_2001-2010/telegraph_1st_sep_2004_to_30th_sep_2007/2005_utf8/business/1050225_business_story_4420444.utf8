 Calcutta, Feb. 24: The Chennai-based Ramco group is all set to make Bengal its manufacturing base in diversified areas.

 The Rs 1600-crore group has interests in cement, building blocks, yarn and textile and information technology. Apart from Tamil Nadu, the group?s 20 manufacturing units are spread in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, Silvasa and also Sri Lanka. 

 Ramco will formally enter Bengal on Saturday when chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee inaugurates a fibre cement sheet plant and lay a foundation stone for a 600-tonne-a-day cement grinding project at Kharagpur.

 Group chairman P. R. Ramasubrahmaneya Rajha said Madras Cement, a Ramco group company, has already approached the state government for land to set up a 1-million-tonne cement grinding unit. Rajha said the group was keen to fan out its textile and yarn manufacturing to the eastern region and Bengal would be the best place to begin with.

 Another group company, Ramco Systems Ltd, engaged in software development and information technology, will also consider expanding its network in Bengal, he said.

 In his welcome address at the inauguration in Kharagpur, a copy of which is available with The Telegraph, Rajha has noted, ?Bengal is the best place to invest in view of the state government?s pragmatic approach to our industrial needs.?

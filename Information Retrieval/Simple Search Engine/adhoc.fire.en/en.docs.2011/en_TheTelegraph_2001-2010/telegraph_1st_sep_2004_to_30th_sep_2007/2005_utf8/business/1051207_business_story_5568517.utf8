 ANZ account in China

 Tianjin, China, Dec. 6 (Reuters): Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ), Australias third-largest lender, on Tuesday joined a rush of foreign banks into China by signing a deal to buy 19.9 per cent of second-tier lender Tianjin City Commercial Bank for $120 million.

 The tie-up marks the first direct investment in a Chinese lender by ANZ and is the biggest stake yet taken in China by an Australian bank, chief executive John McFarlane told reporters after a signing ceremony.

 Beijing is relying on foreign banks for capital and expertise to help clean up a financial industry bogged down with $200 billion in bad loans. By late October, 19 foreign institutions, including ANZs home rival Commonwealth Bank of Australia Ltd, had pumped $16.5 billion into 16 local lenders.

 ANZs participation as a strategic investor will help Tianjin City Commercial Bank bring in advanced experience and methods and help improve its corporate governance and operations, Wang Jinlong, president of the Tianjin bank, said. Banking sources said ANZ had beaten Bank of East Asia in the last round of bidding for Tianjin City Commercial.

 Tianjin is a port city of more than 5 million people about 120 km (75 miles) Southeast of Beijing, to which it will be connected by high-speed train in time for the 2008 Olympics.

 McFarlane said the citys location on Bohai Bay, a fast-growing industrial area, opened up promising opportunities for the Tianjin bank, which was established in 1996 and had 64.5 billion yuan ($7.3 billion) in assets at the end of October. ANZ, with assets of A$293 billion ($223 billion), has the most extensive network in Asia among Australias banks, although its Asia-Pacific operations accounted for only 6 per cent of its 2005 net profit of A$3.0 billion ($2.3 billion).

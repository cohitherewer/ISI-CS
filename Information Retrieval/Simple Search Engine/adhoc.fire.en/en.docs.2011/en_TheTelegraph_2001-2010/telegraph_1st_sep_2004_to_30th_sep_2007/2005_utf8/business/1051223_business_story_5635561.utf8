 Reliance sets stock cut-off

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Gains all the way

 Mumbai, Dec. 22: Investors holding Reliance Industries (RIL) shares on January 25 will receive stocks of four Anil Ambani companies spawned by the demerger.

 Bombay High Court had earlier this month approved a scheme to demerge four entities ? Reliance Energy Ventures Limited, Global Fuel Management Services Limited, Reliance Capital Ventures Limited and Reliance Communication Ventures Limited ? out of Reliance Industries.

 For every share of Reliance, shareholders, except the specified ones, will get one stock each of the four companies, Reliance told the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) today.

 Each share of Reliance Energy Ventures Limited and Reliance Capital Ventures Limited will have a face value of Rs 10. Those of Global Fuel Management Service Ltd and Reliance Communication Ventures Ltd will be marked at Rs 5.

 RIL informed the bourses that it has fixed the record date for the demerger scheme on January 25.

 On Wednesday, RIL announced that the demerger scheme became effective on December 21, when it filed the certified copy of the Bombay High Court order with the Registrar of Companies (RoC).

 On the BSE today, the RIL scrip closed at Rs 855.10 after opening at Rs 864.25 and rising to an intra-day high of Rs 869.50.

 Reliance chief Mukesh D. Ambani had promised his shareholders an equal number of shares of Anil Ambanis companies. After its board meeting in August, Reliance Industries had announced that shareholders would be issued shares of demerged undertakings in the 1:1 ratio.

 Anil Ambani also intends to list all the four entities that came under his fold.

 The demerger followed an amicable settlement between the two Ambani brothers on the ownership of various companies under the Reliance empire.

 While elder brother Mukesh got control of flagship Reliance Industries along with IPCL, Anil took charge of Reliance Infocomm, Reliance Energy and Reliance Capital. 

 NTPC relief

 Bombay High Court today deferred till tomorrow the petition filed by the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) alleging breach of a contract by RIL for not signing the gas sales and purchase agreement.

 The hearing was adjourned by Justice S.F. Vajifdar as both sides sought time to argue the matter.

 Hearing the arguments, the judge said this is a delicate matter and both parties should reach an amicable solution through communication with each other and attempt to solve the differences they have.

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Hyderabad, Feb. 27: The Rs 2000-crore Nagarjuna group has sought the appointment of a liquidator to take control of Nagarjuna Finance Ltd, which, after change of management, was not refunding money to depositors.

 ?NFL changed hands with Mahalakshmi Factoring in the late nineties, which paid money to the depositors till 2002 but have been avoiding its responsibility for the last 2-3 years,? group chairman K. S. Raju said. Nagarjuna group has nothing to do with the liabilities of Mahalakshmi Factoring Services Ltd, he added.

 Still about Rs 40 crore were due to depositors, he said.

 Meanwhile, the registrar of companies has filed a case against the old and the new management and named about 35 persons, including Raju, for causing inconvenience to the depositors and has sought prosecution of the management personnel.

 Raju told reporters here that Mahalakshmi Factoring had moveable and immovable assets worth over Rs 90 crore.

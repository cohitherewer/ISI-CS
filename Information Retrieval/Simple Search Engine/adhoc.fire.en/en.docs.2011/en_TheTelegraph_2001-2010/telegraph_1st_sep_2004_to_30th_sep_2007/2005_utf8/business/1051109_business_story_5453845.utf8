 Alls not lost for Huawei

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Sinha: Open mind

 New Delhi, Nov. 8: Huawei, the Chinese telecom equipment maker, can still hope to participate in the BSNL tender for 60-million GSM lines to be floated next month. 

 A.K. Sinha, chairman and managing director of Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, today said discussions were on with Huawei and it had not yet been blacklisted from participating in future business contracts.

 The Huawei spokesperson said, Letters have been exchanged between us and BSNL on the issue. Soon, we will have a one-to-one discussion to sort out the issue. 

 Sinha said BSNL would face problems in achieving its target to provide GSM connection to many in different parts of the country. He, however, felt that such problems were faced by all the companies and vendors and can be sorted out through discussions. 

 Early this year, Huawei had bagged a tender to lay 1.05 lakh telephone lines based on code division multiple access (CDMA) technology along with two Indian partners ? Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd and Semiconductors Corporation of India Ltd. However, the work on network has not yet begun. 

 Both Huawei and its partners have been blaming each other for the delay. While Huawei claims that its Indian partners had bid low and would lead to a loss if they implemented the project, the partners claim that they did not bid and it was the Chinese company that took the decision. But they are still willing to implement the project if Huawei supplies them the equipment.

 BSNL profit

 BSNL today announced that it earned a net profit of over Rs 10,000 crore during 2004-05 on a turnover of Rs 36,000 crore.

 We have registered a record turnover of Rs 36,000 crore in 2004-05, up by Rs 2,000 crore over the previous financial year. We have paid a dividend of Rs 1,175 crore, Sinha said while handing over the Rs 975-crore dividend cheque to communications minister Dayanidhi Maran.

 Sinha said, Despite the fierce competition in the telecom market and declining tariffs the company has shown remarkable results during the year 2004-05. The overall revenue of the company increased to a total of Rs 36,090 crore, a net increase of Rs 2081 over the previous year. The overall profit recorded was Rs 10,183 crore.

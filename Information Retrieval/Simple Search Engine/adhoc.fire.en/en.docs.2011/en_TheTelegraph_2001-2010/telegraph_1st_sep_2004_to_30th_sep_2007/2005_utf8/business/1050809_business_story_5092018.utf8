 RIL roars off the block with gas find

 - Deep impact, from discovery to rating

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 8: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has struck 3.75 trillion cubic feet of in-place gas reserves in two coal bed methane (CBM) blocks in Madhya Pradesh.

 This was revealed by the director-general of hydrocarbons today, even as RIL officials declined comment on the new find. It comes only days after RIL chairman Mukesh D. Ambani sounded an optimistic note for the exploration and production business at the companys annual general meeting.

 Ambani had hinted at the new gas find when he said, Last year, I talked about seven wells being drilled for coal-bed methane. Since then, we have drilled 12 more as well as 10 production test wells at the Sohagpur blocks in Madhya Pradesh. I am happy to inform you that commercial viability of these CBM blocks has now been established. 

 The RIL chairman had also said the company is conducting more studies and production on a pilot scale to assess the potential. RIL is likely to commercially develop these resources by 2009-10. 

 RIL is also developing CBM fields in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh by drilling 10 information wells.

 The company is focussing on exploration and production to emerge as a global energy player. 

 Over the next four to five years, it has committed around Rs 17,600 crore as investments in this area of business.

 RIL has formulated an exploration programme in deep waters with two-thirds of its acreage falling in this segment. 

 Apart from holding a 90 per cent participating interest in the Krishna-Godavari (KG) and North Eastern Coast (NEC) basins, RIL has won five blocks under the fifth round of new exploration licensing policy.

 The company aims to complete the development of the KG D6 block by 2008-09. The first full year of commercial production is expected in 2009-10. In the first phase, Reliance Industries is likely to achieve 40 million cubic metres per day of gas production.

 In the annual general meeting, Ambani had said the company had made 10 oil and gas discoveries since last year. These include three discoveries in NEC 25, six in KG D6 and one in Yemen.

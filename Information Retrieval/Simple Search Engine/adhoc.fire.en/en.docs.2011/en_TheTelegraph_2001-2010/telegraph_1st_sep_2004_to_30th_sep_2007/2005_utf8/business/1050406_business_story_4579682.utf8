 SAIL wing eyes more output

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, April 5: The raw materials division (RMD) of Steel Authority of India (SAIL) aims at increasing iron ore production to 14.06 million tonnes (MT) in the current fiscal.

 The division, which caters to SAIL?s plants at Bokaro, Durgapur, and Rourkella, has produced a record 12.94 MT last financial year, surpassing the previous high of 12.79 MT achieved in fiscal 03-04.

 In 2004-05, RMD?s iron ore mines at Kiriburu, Meghataburu and Bolani achieved 3.62 MT, 3.57 MT and 3.32 MT output respectively. Barsua iron mines produced 1.34 MT and recorded an growth of 14.5 per cent over the previous year.

 In 2004-05, no iron ore was bought for the three plants compared with the purchase of 99,000 tonnes in 2003-04.

 Several steps are being taken to augment the production at the mines. The RMD division is commissioning a 600-tonne-per-hour crushing and screening plant at Bolani in May that will take production to 1 MT there. Accordingly, loading facilities are also being expanded. Moreover, preparatory work to develop the south block at Kiriburu and the central block at Meghataburu have been taken up.

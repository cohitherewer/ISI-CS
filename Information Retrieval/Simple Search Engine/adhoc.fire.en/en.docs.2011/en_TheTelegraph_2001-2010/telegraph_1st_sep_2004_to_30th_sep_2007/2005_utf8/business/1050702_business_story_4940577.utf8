 New norms for venture funds 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, July 1: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has ruled that fresh investments made by commercial banks in venture capital after July 1 will not be classified under priority-sector lending.

 Investments that have already been made by banks up to June 30 in venture capital will be treated as priority-sector lending till March 31, 2006. From April 1, 2006, these investments will stop being classified under priority-sector lending.

 The central bank said this decision was taken after a review of recent developments, including overall credit growth and rise in investments in venture capital compared with other sectors. 

 Banks were allowed to invest in venture capital under priority-sector lending provided the funds/companies are registered with Sebi.

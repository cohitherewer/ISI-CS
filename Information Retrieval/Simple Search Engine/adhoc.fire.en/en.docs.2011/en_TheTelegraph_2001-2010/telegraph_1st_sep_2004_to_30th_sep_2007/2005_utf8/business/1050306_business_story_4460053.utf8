 Deadline set for new tax bill

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 5: Finance minister P. Chidambaram has set a time schedule for framing the new bill on direct and indirect taxes. The bill will be drafted by April or May and discussed by the parliamentary standing committee before being passed by Parliament.

 The bill will address one of the biggest disappointments that industry had with the budget: it will tweak the rules on mergers and acquisitions that didn?t form part of the budget.

 Industry has been seeking a relaxation in the requirement that makes it mandatory for a company to continue in the same line of business for at least five years after a merger. Industry reckons this is a major impediment to mergers and consolidation of businesses.

 The tax bill is expected to clean up the non-revenue provisions that were left out of the budget.

 Addressing captains of industry at a meeting organised by Assocham (the last of the post-budget meetings with industry), Chidambaram said there will be ?no policy shocks? in the tax regime. ?It will not be tinkered or tampered with for the next 4-5 years,? he said.

 He said the objective was to introduce a brand new income tax bill which, at present, is ?far too cluttered?.

 Chidambaram said: ?I think the tax system should be simple, straightforward and as far as possible non-interactive and completely automated. It must put the least amount of scrutiny and reopening of assessments or suo-motu revisions.?

 The finance minister said some states were not ready with their legislations on the value-added tax regime which is scheduled to be implemented across the country from April 1. 

 ?There are rumblings of dissent from certain quarters and I sincerely hope that these are not politically motivated,? he added.

 Defending budgetary provisions regarding depreciation rates, Chidambaram said the internal accruals will continue to remain equal to the replacement cost of machinery in the next five years.

 He said ?there was nothing to fear quot; about the lower depreciation rate specified in the budget. If the company was in an expansion mode and employed more capital, it would gain because the initial depreciation rates had been increased to 20 per cent from 15 per cent.

 Chidambaram added that the sunset clause on tax exemptions for units in the special economic zones (SEZs) were designed to accelerate investments. The clause was introduced in view of the fact that the political term of this government ends in 2009, he added.

 The industry is up in arms against the budget proposal to end tax holiday for SEZ units from 2009 onwards, saying it was against the spirit of the proposed central legislation on these zones which is to be taken up by the cabinet after the group of ministers finalises its recommendations.

 Q amp;A

 Get your share

 My dad held shares of some companies in physical form. After his demise, we are the legal heirs of those shares. However, though we have the records of the shares, the certificates have been misplaced. How can we get duplicates?

 Prithish and Sourish Nandy, Calcutta

 You will have to request the registrars of the companies for duplicate share certificates and send the necessary documents, including attested death certificate and legal heirship certificate. You will also have to provide certified true copy of complaint letter lodged with the police, an indemnity bond, an affidavit, specimen signatures of the legal heirs duly attested by the bankers along with a no-objection letter duly attested in case of multiple legal heirs. 

 Lets split it

 I purchased a flat by taking a home loan with my wife as co-borrower. Shall both of us be entitled to tax benefit proportionately as both of us are salaried individuals?

 Mehul Agarwal, by e-mail

 If both of you are co-owners as well as co-borrowers for the loan, then each of you can claim the exemptions.

 Double benefit

 I have taken a term insurance plan with the option of accidental death benefit. I also have a comprehensive car insurance. Will there be any problem in getting the benefit amount in case of accidental death from both companies?

 S. Raheja, Ranchi

 There will be no problem in getting the benefit amount from both the companies since the nature of the policies are different, one being a life insurance and the other being a general insurance policy.

 Cash component

 I work for a private firm and receive some portion of my salary in cash. In case of a personal loan, will the cash component be considered while calculating my loan eligibility?

 Surabhi Mitra, Jamshedpur

 less supporting documents are provided, finance companies do not consider any income by way of cash. However, if you can provide proof for cash income by way of vouchers or a statement from the employer along with relevant entries in bank statements, they may consider part or full of such income.

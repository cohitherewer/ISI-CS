 Dell to hire 3000 more

 Bangalore, April 29: Dell will add nearly 3,000 people in India this year to reach a total workforce of 10,000 and plans to build new centres in other cities to keep pace with the booming global business.

 Dell will expand to cities with talent (fluency in English), low cost of operations and potential for growth. ?By the end of 2005, we should be about 10,000 in India. We are growing continuously as we find the talent base and enthusiasm in them second to none,? Kevin B. Rollins, president and CEO of Dell Inc, said. 

 Dell, which set up its first customer contact centre in Bangalore in May 2001, has opened similar centres at Hyderabad and Chandigarh. Rollins, however, was tight-lipped on the quantum of investment planned for expansion of operations in India as well as the cities likely to be chosen for its new facilities.

 Rollins said, ?Over time, our Indian operations have grown in technical complexity and so we are making it a centre of competency for software and support. As we move to increase our revenues to $80 billion in three to four years, our growth will increasingly come from outside the US,? he said.

 The company plans to transform itself from a PC maker to a broad-based IT company. ?China, India, Japan and the European countries will be the high-growth markets,? he said.

 Rollins said Dell?s decision in November 2003 to move back some customer-support to the US from Bangalore was because of the company?s internal management issues. ?Then, we were doing too much, too fast in too many places. We had to prioritise and refine,? he said.

 The CEO dismissed reports against outsourcing to India. ?People here have capabilities and maturity to handle such work,? he said.

 Crash culprits get notice 

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, March 18: Finance minister P. Chidambaram today said the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has found irregularities, which led to the May 2004 stock market crash.

 The market regulator has issued show-cause notices to 12 entities for the crash. However, he did not divulge any further as the matter is still sub-judice. 

 Responding to a question in Parliament, Chidambaram expressed fear of a tsunami-like occurrence in the capital markets. 

 He said Sebi was keeping a close watch on market transactions. 

 The minister, however, admitted that the irregularities took place when the Congress-led coalition government took office in May.

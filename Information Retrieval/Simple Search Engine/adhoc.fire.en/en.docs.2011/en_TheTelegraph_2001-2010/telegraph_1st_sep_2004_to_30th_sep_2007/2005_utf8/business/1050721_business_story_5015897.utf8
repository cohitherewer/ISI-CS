 Turbulence over A-I lease deal

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, July 20: Dinesh Trivedi, Trinamul MP and member of the Parliamentary committee on civil aviation, has raised questions over Air-India?s move to wet-lease planes from competitor Jet Airways. 

 Wet lease is when one rents an aircraft along with pilots and crew.

 ?The most surprising thing is that these are the same planes that Air-India had earlier rejected when offered to it directly. The reason given was that these were not suitable. I wonder how these aircraft have now become suitable for Air-India through a competitor,? Trivedi said. He has also written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. 

 Jet Airways? Airbus 340-300 was leased from South African Airways. It was to be deployed on the US route but delays in getting a clearance have held up the service. 

 ?Normally, competitors do not go out of their way to help out rivals ... this seems to be a bid to help Jet even as Air- India bleeds,? Trivedi told The Telegraph. 

 This comes on the back of an Air-India internal circular warning top management against sharing confidential information about the airline and cooperating with competitors in any way, he pointed out.

 Trivedi said Air-India had significant spare capacity and need not have taken planes on wet lease. 

 ?Besides if even new carriers can recruit pilots from the market, including from Europe, one fails to see why the state run carrier should be unable to hire pilots and has to depend on wet leases.?

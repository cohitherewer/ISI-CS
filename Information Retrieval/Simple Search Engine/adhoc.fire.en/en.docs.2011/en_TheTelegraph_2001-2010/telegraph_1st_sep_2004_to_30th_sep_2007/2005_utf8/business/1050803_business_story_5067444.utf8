 Jubilant share sale to fetch Rs 109 cr

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, Aug. 2: Jubilant Organosys Ltd will raise around Rs 109 crore through a private placement of 9.90 lakh shares to General Atlantic LLC (GA), a global private equity firm. The placement is being done at a price of Rs 1,100 per share.

 Jubilant, a Delhi-based contract research and manufacturing services firm, said these newly issued shares will be given to one or more investment entities affiliated to GA. The proceeds will be used to fund its growth plans. 

 After the issue, Abhay Havaldar, managing director of GA in Mumbai, will join Jubilants board. GA, which owns close to 4.9 per cent of Jubilants shares, will increase its stake to around 8.39 per cent after the placement.

 Jubilant CMD Shyam S. Bhartia said while the company has a growth momentum with a robust portfolio covering the entire pharmaceuticals value chain, the capital will enable it to pursue its plans. We intend to leverage the investment to continue to strengthen our knowledge-based and IP-led capabilities, and expand our offerings to global pharmaceuticals and life sciences businesses.

 He said GAs experience in healthcare/ pharmaceuticals, expertise in outsourced services and global network of professionals would help Jubilant enhance its business in global markets.

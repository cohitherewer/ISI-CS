 Calcutta, May 10: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) is making a special effort to reach out to workers and trade unions to improve industrial relations in the state.

 The CII will conduct an open house with Kali Ghosh, Bengal state secretary of Citu, the trade union arm of CPI(M), on June 2.

 During the session, CII members can interact with Ghosh on both general and specific issues related to industrial relations.

 The members will be encouraged to raise their specific problems with the Citu secretary. ?This is going to be a confidence building measure. We want to dispel the air of mistrust between the management and workers,? Ravi Poddar, the newly elected chairman of CII (eastern region), said.

 According to him, there was a communication gap with each side doubting the others intention.

 The initiative is well timed given the fact that the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government is fighting the image problem to woo investors to the state.

 ?We want to tell them that we are against retrenchment. But they have to see that industry survives,? Poddar said.

 Industry believes that there is a lack of accountability among workers. ?We need to take senior trade union people in confidence and explain the situation. This can then trickle down to the lower levels,? Poddar added.

SME focus

 The theme for CII eastern region in 2005-06 will be Sustainable growth in the east: Focus on SMEs. The chamber aims to promote a strong consolidated and competitive SME base in the region. This is expected to boost the local economy in rural centres.

 Bhusen Raina, deputy chairman of CII (ER), said the chamber plans to reach out to smaller cities like Kharagpur, Durgapur, Haldia and Balasore.

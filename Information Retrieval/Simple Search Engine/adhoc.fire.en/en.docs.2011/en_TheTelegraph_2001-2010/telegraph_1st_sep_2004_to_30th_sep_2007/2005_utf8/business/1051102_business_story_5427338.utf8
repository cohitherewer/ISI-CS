 Radico seeks Rabo help in brand hunt

 Calcutta, Nov. 1: Radico Khaitan has mandated Rabo India to scout for brands for acquisition both at home and abroad. The company has also appointed Kotak Investment Banking to explore the financing options.

 ?We have given the mandate to both Rabo India and Kotak Investment Banking a week back and expect a positive feedback in the next six months since such deals usually take some time to materialise,? Radico Khaitan managing director Abhishek Khaitan said.

 The country?s second largest liquor company wants to acquire brands to fuel growth. It had recently snapped up eight key brands of Brihan Maharashtra Sugar Syndicate Limited for Rs 35 crore. The total volume from Brihan?s portfolio acquired by Radico was about 1 million cases in 2004-05.

 ?We are constantly on the lookout for buoyant brands to complement our portfolio. Depending on the target, financing would not be a problem,? said Khaitan.

 ?We will set up a grain-based distillery plant for Rs 85 crore at Rampur in Uttar Pradesh. It is the first-of-its-kind grain-based distillery plant in the country and is expected to start operations from December,? he added.

 The new distillery ? part of Radicos strategic growth move ? would help the company compete in the US and European markets, where whiskies are made of grain and not molasses, he said.

 ?We are present in 30 countries and are keen on increasing the share of exports. For the first half of the current fiscal, we have achieved a growth of 300 per cent in exports and hope to maintain it for the whole year,? said Khaitan.

 To strengthen its overseas market, Radico had recently set up a subsidiary ? Radico Global ? in Dubai for global trading and routing future acquisitions or joint ventures outside India.

 In the second quarter ended September 30, Radico has clocked Rs 8.63 crore net profit, a growth of 39 per cent from Rs 6.21 crore in the previous year period. The sales turnover is Rs 275.44 crore, a growth of 11 per cent from Rs 247.68 crore achieved during the same period last fiscal.

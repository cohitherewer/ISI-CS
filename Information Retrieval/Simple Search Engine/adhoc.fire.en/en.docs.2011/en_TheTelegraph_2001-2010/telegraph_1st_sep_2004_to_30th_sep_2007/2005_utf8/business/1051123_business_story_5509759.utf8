 Govt, Left at loggerheads over IFCI

 GAURAV CHOUDHURY AMP; JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Nov. 22: The fate of IFCI is uncertain as the government is not in favour of amalgamating it with any other entity, although Left leaders are pitching for its merger with IDBI or any other institution.

 Senior North Block officials said the government is not in favour of continuing with IFCI as a purely development financial institution as it has accumulated a net loss of Rs 4,300 crore as on March 31. 

 They feel the setting up of asset reconstruction companies will hasten the process of cleaning up IFCI?s bleeding balance sheet and its eventual closure.

 Left leaders have, however, opposed the liquidation of IFCI. They have argued that a public sector development banking entity is necessary for the country?s overall development paradigm.

 Sources said the government feels in the modern banking framework, operating an organisation such as IFCI is not required as the credit delivery system is much more integrated now.

 CPI?s A.B. Bardhan and RSP?s Abani Roy have written to the Prime Minister seeking an attempt to revive the flagging fortunes of IFCI by merging it with a suitable partner.

 As the government?s holding in IFCI has already been reduced to a minority, it is difficult to merge IFCI with any other public sector financial institution. 

 As on September 30, the government held a little over 40 per cent in IFCI.

 Banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, central and state governments and non-government institutions have a combined shareholding of 41.09 per cent. Foreign institutional investors hold 12.12 per cent and the public 35.36 per cent. The remaining 11.43 per cent is held by private corporate bodies and non-resident Indians.

 The government?s shareholding in IFCI is through public sector entities like IDBI, which holds the maximum of 18.15 per cent. General Insurance Corporation, Life Insurance Corporation, New India Assurance, Oriental Insurance Co and State Bank of India have a combined shareholding of about 16 per cent.

 Analysts feel a bleeding balance sheet with a loss of about Rs 4,300 crore has left very little for shareholders to gain even in case of liquidation. Under existing legal provisions, ordinary shareholders have the last right in case of liquidation of a company.

 Left leaders, on the other hand, are arguing that merging it with IDBI would be the best possible option for shareholders and employees. In the merged entity, IFCI could operate as the development banking arm of IDBI, they said.

 The very structure of present shareholding also creates a piquant situation for the government to take a decision on merging it with IDBI or any other FI. IFCI, which was set up under an act of Parliament as early as 1948, was corporatised in 1993.

 For a long time, the government has been controlling IFCI through IDBI. Since 1993, it has held the IFCI stake through the shares held by IDBI and other public sector institutions.

 But IDBI, through which the government owned 31.1 per cent out of the 60.08 per cent state?s stake as on March 31, quietly started selling IFCI equity through the year. Some 12.09 per cent stake was sold. The major part of it, about 10 per cent, was offloaded after the Congress government came in power in May 2004. 

 The reason given by IDBI for the stake sale was that under the regulatory norms, a bank could not invest more than 5 per cent of its equity base in any other FI.

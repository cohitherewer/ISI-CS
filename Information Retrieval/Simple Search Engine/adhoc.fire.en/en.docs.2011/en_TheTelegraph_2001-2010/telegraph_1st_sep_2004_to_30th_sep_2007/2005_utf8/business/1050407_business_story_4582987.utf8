The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 Qwest snubbed yet again

 KEN BELSON AND MATT RICHTEL 

 New York, April 6: The 

 board of MCI Inc said late Tuesday night that it was sticking 

 by its merger agreement with Verizon Communications and 

 rejecting a higher bid from rival Qwest Communications.

 MCI?s board made the decision 

 after spending the day reconsidering Qwest?s bid, which 

 is 19 per cent higher than Verizon?s. Qwest?s chief executive, 

 Richard C. Notebaert, had asked MCI to decide by midnight 

 Tuesday whether his company?s bid was superior to the $7.6-billion 

 deal MCI had agreed to with Verizon.

 Despite Qwest?s bid being higher, 

 MCI?s board considered Verizon to be more stable and, as 

 a result, a better long-term prospect.

 Qwest has not ruled out raising 

 its bid again. But more likely, industry analysts say, the 

 company will take its case to MCI?s shareholders, many of 

 whom have lobbied their board to accept Qwest?s $8.9-billion 

 bid. A Qwest spokesman said: ?MCI?s board has chosen to 

 reject what we believe is a superior offer.?

 The company currently is weighing 

 its options, and Qwest and MCI shareholders will dictate 

 the next steps in the process.?

 A showdown could come at MCI?s 

 next shareholder meeting, which is tentatively scheduled 

 for May 16. At that meeting, shareholders will likely have 

 the chance to vote on whether to approve the merger with 

 Verizon, according to proxy specialists.

 In the intervening weeks, Qwest 

 could try to persuade more MCI shareholders to throw their 

 weight behind its bid and to reject the deal with Verizon.

 ?Behind the scenes, they would 

 promote a proxy fight with some of the existing MCI shareholders 

 who are unhappy with the position of their board,? said 

 James P. Melican, a managing director at Proxy Governance 

 Inc, an independent proxy advisory firm.

 Notebaert, in a letter sent to 

 MCI?s board Tuesday, said his companys offer was ?our 

 best current offer?, signalling his unwillingness to raise 

 Qwest?s bid any time soon.

 Perhaps unintentionally, Qwest?s 

 bid for MCI has forced investors to re-examine the company?s 

 prospects. What they have found in Qwest is a company whose 

 weaknesses have become even more glaring in light of consolidation 

 and technological changes in the telecommunications industry.

 Some analysts say that to survive, 

 Qwest needs to become part of a larger entity, either by 

 acquiring a competitor or being acquired. A merger with 

 MCI was the company?s best bet, and the remaining options 

 are either less appealing or more difficult to pull off.

 If Qwest cannot find an appropriate 

 merger partner, it could dress itself up to be taken over. 

 Notebaert has spent the last two years cleaning up the company?s 

 balance sheet and cutting expenses.

 Ford goes fast on upgrade

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Mumbai, Oct. 28: Ford Motor will pump $75 million (Rs 339 crore) into its Indian operations to support its ambitious plans.

 The announcement comes days after chairman and chief executive officer Bill Ford indicated that fresh investments were on their way for the expansion in India.

 ?To support the aggressive growth strategy, Ford India will be augmenting its subscribed capital. The company has received approval from Ford Motor for an additional equity infusion of $75 million to meet the needs of our future plans,? said Arvind Mathew, managing director and president of Ford India. Company officials, however, refused to reveal details on how the money would be used.

 Ford India, which has its plant near Chennai, has invested around $375 million in the country so far. The company began operations in 1996 in a joint venture with Mahindra and Mahindra. That later became its fully-owned subsidiary in 2005. 

 It sells four models in the country, including the Ikon, Endeavour, Mondeo and Fusion. The company recently announced a new model, Fiesta, which was designed and engineered globally. The Fiesta is scheduled for commercial launch in November.

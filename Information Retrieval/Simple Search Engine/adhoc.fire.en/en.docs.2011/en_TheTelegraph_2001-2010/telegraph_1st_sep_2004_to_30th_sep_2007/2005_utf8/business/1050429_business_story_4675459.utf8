 Petro price revision takes a backseat

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Aiyar: Status quo

 New Delhi, April 28: There will be no change in prices of petrol and diesel ?in the immediate future?, petroleum minister Mani Shankar Aiyar said today. 

 However, he said an attempt was being made to arrive at a consensus in the UPA coalition on the issue of revising prices in line with duty changes announced in the budget and the surge in global prices. 

 In order to offset the duty changes, the oil companies require a Rs 2.52 per litre and a Rs 1.65 a litre increase in the prices of petrol and diesel, respectively. 

 To factor in the surge in global rates as well, the oil companies have asked for a Rs 4.59 a litre increase in petrol and Rs 5.18 per litre hike in diesel prices in domestic markets. 

 However, the Left parties have made it very clear that they are opposed to any increase in the price of petrol and diesel. 

 They have instead presented a three-point formula to shield the ?common man from the impact of soaring international prices of oil.

 According to this formula, the additional 50 paise per litre cess on petrol and diesel should be shelved, the levy for the oil industry development fund should be scrapped and excise duties reworked in order to enable the oil companies to cushion consumers from the price hike.

 The CPM feels the 50 paise cess on petrol and diesel for the road fund could be shelved until global rates of oil came down to more stable levels. 

 This would result in a saving of Rs 3,000 crore for the oil companies as the cess has still not been passed on to the consumer. The cess imposed for collecting funds for the Oil Industry Development Board amounts to Rs 5,400 crore every year and is not actually handed over to the industry.

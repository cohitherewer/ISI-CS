 Grain export proves to be quite costly

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 New Delhi, May 6: The export of 33 million tonnes of foodgrains from FCI godowns during November 2000 to February 2004 has cost the nation nearly Rs 1,609 crore as additional subsidy while another Rs 516 crore was given to exporters as freight charges for the inland movement of stocks at FCIs expense. 

 These startling revelations have been made in the Comptroller and Auditor Generals (CAG) report tabled in Parliament today. 

 The export of wheat and rice was approved the BJP-led government to clear excess stocks that had accumulated in the central pool.

 The CAG report states the price at which wheat was sold to exporters was worked out on the criteria used for calculating the price that consumers under the public distribution ought to pay and were not relevant for the trade market.

 ?In the process, the price fixed for exporters was lower, resulting in short realisation of Rs 1608.63 crore and thus led to additional subsidy burden, the report points out. 

 The report has also highlighted the fact that exporters were allowed to lift rice and wheat from godowns of their choice and FCI had to foot the transport charges for delivering the foodgrains at the port from which the exports were undertaken. For instance, foodgrains were transported from Raichur in Karnataka to Kandla port in Gujarat and from Punjab to Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu. 

 FCI ended up paying Rs 516.36 crore as freight charges for exporters. As a result, FCIs net realisation on exports fell to levels that were below the price at which wheat and rice were sold to the below poverty line (BPL) population of the country through the public distribution system. 

 The CAG report cites an ?undue benefit of Rs 44.25 crore was given to exporters for exports to Bangladesh by rail?.

 ?While these exporters incurred a cost of Rs 30 per tonne on these exports, they were paid a post-delivery expense ranging from Rs 1,175 per tonne to Rs 3,850 per tonne. This avoidable cost took place because of the defective policy of adopting a uniform post-delivery expense for all exporters regardless of whether the exports took place by sea or rail,? the report says.

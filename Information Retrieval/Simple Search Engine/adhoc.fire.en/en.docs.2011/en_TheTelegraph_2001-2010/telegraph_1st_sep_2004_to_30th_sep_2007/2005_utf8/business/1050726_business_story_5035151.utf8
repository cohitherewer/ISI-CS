 Calcutta, July 25: The State Bank of India is on the prowl again, after having acquired two banks in Indonesia and Mauritius.

 The countrys largest commercial bank plans to acquire four more to double its global assets from $13 billion to $26 billion within the next two years. The buyout targets are mid-sized banks with a small number of employees.

 We have identified four banks. However, none of them are in the US. All of them are not in Asia either. We are carrying out a due diligence on them. The reports are expected to be ready within the next three months, managing director T.S. Bhattacharya said on the sidelines of a banking conclave organised by Ficci.

 Bhattacharya did not give a timeframe within which the acquisition will take place. Once the due diligence reports are ready, we will start negotiations, he said.

 The move to enhance the banks asset base has gathered momentum due to the recent comments made by finance minister P. Chidambaram about the State Bank. 

 The finance minister told us that we should match HSBC on business by 2008. We are working towards that goal, Bhattacharya said.

 The bank will raise Rs 3,000 crore tier-II capital this fiscal. Bhattacharya said the government will have to come up with instruments for the bank to raise tier?I capital.

 The government holds 59 per cent in State Bank. The stake can be diluted only by another 8 per cent and, if it is done, the government can get Rs 3,000 crore in the process.

 SBI expects to spend Rs 30,000 crore this fiscal on projects. The bank expects a growth of 35-40 per cent in retail loans, Bhattacharya said. It also expects to bring down net NPAs below 1.5 per cent.

 Bhattacharya said retail, infrastructure, services, manufacturing, small and medium enterprises, agriculture and exports would remain the growth drivers of the economy. 

 Ratnagiri Power

 SBI will hold a 9.8 per cent stake 

 in Ratnagiri Gas amp; Power, the special purpose vehicle 

 that will take over the assets of Dabhol. The companys 

 equity base is Rs 1,500 crore. NTPC, Gail and financial 

 institutions will hold 33.3 per cent each. SBI will 

 invest Rs 147 crore, Bhattacharya said.

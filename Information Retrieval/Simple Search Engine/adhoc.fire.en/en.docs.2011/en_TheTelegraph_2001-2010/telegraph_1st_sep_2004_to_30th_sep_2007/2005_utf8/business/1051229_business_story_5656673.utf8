The Telegraph - Calcutta : Business

 SAP focus on small firms

 CHANDRALEKHA TULAL

 Calcutta, Dec. 28: Small enterprises can now use business applications that were so long affordable only by large firms.

 SAP, a leading global supplier of enterprise applications, will now offer Business One in India for small and medium businesses.

 An entry-level enterprise solutions can be implemented at a cost of Rs 37 lakh at present. However, with Business One, companies with simple requirements will be able to implement it at less than Rs 10 lakh, SAP India head-SMB business Srinivas Rao told The Telegraph.

 We will launch it in India in the third week of January and will make the first round of presentations in Mumbai. By June, we will introduce it in 30-50 cities within the country, said Rao.

 SAP Business One covers the operations necessary to run a small or midsize business, including accounting and banking, customer relationship management, vendor management, material resource planning, purchasing and selling, and reporting and analysis.

 However, it is simple to use and easy to implement, thereby making it ideal for companies requiring less complex functionality from their IT solutions, said Rao.

 Business One can be implemented within weeks and requires lower investments for training. It is the starting point for small and midsize businesses, from 10 to several hundred employees, poised to reap the benefits of business software.

 Apart from affordability, the solution will offer them the flexibility to scale it according to their convenience. It will provide them the scope to upgrade the application to higher levels based on their growth and also to manage that growth, explained Rao. The target market for the application will be companies with turnover between Rs 5 crore and Rs 60 crore. Based on the data of companies between 2004 and 2008, the application has a market potential of Rs 700 crore.

 Japan Bank to part-fund Suzuki plant

 JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY

 New Delhi, Nov. 30: Japan Bank for International Co-operation will part-fund carmaker Suzukis automobile plant in Haryana and expects further investments from Japanese automobile and auto component manufacturers here.

 JBIC director for Asia amp; Oceania, Wataru Yoshida, told The Telegraph that his bank would pump in $200 million (Rs 900 crore) into Suzukis new plant. But that is not the only investment by Japanese automakers here. With Toyota coming to India in a big way, we can expect large scale investments by Japanese automobile component and engineering companies to support it.

 Suzuki recently got the FIPB clearance to set up a joint venture car plant in Haryana, which would manufacture and sell top-end Suzuki four-wheelers. Suzuki will hold a 30 per cent stake in the plant. 

 It is also setting up an engine manufacturing facility ? Suzuki Powertrain ? with a 51 per cent stake. 

 The initial investment is expected to be around Rs 1,500 crore, while Suzukis total investment in India over the next few years is expected to be about Rs 6,000 crore. 

 Suzuki has also set up a motorcycle plant, which will start rolling out two-wheelers by the end of this year. 

 Rival Toyota is expected to launch its small car in 2007 in collaboration with Daihatsu. It will also step up investments here.

 Ever since there was a confrontation between striking workers and the police at Hondas two-wheeler plant in Gurgaon, there have been apprehensions about Japanese investment plans in the countrys auto sector.

 Yoshida, however, said when Suzuki entered India, Japanese engineering and auto parts companies were still not aware of the size of the market. 

 Now, when Toyota is expanding in India and Nissan is studying the market, the Japanese auto parts and engineering firms have started getting bullish about India ... one can expect large inflows of Japanese investments in the sector now, he added. 

 Japans honeymoon with Chinas new market economy turning sour, investors from the island nation are keen on Indian links. 

 Japanese retail funds have already toasted India. Nomura Asset Management, which launched its $990 million India Fund in June, is said to have been swamped within days after it was started.

 Daimler to spruce up sales

 In top gear

 New Delhi, March 10: Luxury carmaker DaimlerChrysler expects sales in India to almost treble to over 5,000 units by 2010.

 The demand has been spurred by the healthy economic growth and other positive factors, DaimlyerChrysler officials said here. 

 They said though still at a medium level, the demand in India has increased in the last couple of years and the company is optimistic. 

 The company counts growth in the economy and increased efforts at infrastructure development, including good roads, as reasons for the optimism. 

 DaimlerChrysler entered India in the year 1994 and assembles cars at its plant in Pune. The car major sources auto parts from India. 

 It is also planning to launch its Actros range of heavy truck, directly in competition to Sweden?s Volvo, which has been in the Indian market for some years now.

 The company said senior officials of the parent company have showed keen interest in the emerging Indian market. 

 DaimlerChrysler, which sells the Mercedes-Benz S-class, E-class and C-class in the Indian market, reported a total sales of 1,727 units in 2004 against 1,497 units in the previous year.

 In a pointer to the rising demand for luxury vehicles, the company has sold 88 units of its super luxury Maybach model, which it launched in 2004.

 In recent years, the demand for big luxury cars in the country have been steadily rising, although volumes continue to be driven by the low-priced small cars and hatchbacks. 

 Mercedes, which is synonymous with luxury, has a very good brand recall in India, analysts said.

 Following the 5 per cent customs duty reduction in the Union budget, the company has cut the prices of its vehicles between Rs 35,000 and Rs 1 lakh. 

 Officials maintain that the quality of cars produced in India by DaimlerChrysler was today at par with those made in Germany. 

 The Asia-Pacific market is one of the prime growth area earmarked by the German company.

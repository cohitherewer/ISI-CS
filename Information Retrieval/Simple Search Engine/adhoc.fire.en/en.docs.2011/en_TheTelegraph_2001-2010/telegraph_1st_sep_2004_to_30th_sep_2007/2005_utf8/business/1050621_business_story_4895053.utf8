 The following is the 

 text of the e-mail sent by Mukesh Ambani to employees of 

 Reliance Infocomm:

 My dear Infocommers,

 My younger brother Shri Anil Ambani is taking over the stewardship of Reliance Infocomm. He has enormous energy and drive and we share a common commitment to take forward the legacy of our father Shri Dhirubhai Ambani.

 Reliance Infocomm has grown from Shri Dhirubhai Ambanis dream of making the cost of a phone call cheaper than that of a post card. I take this opportunity to congratulate you for your contribution in translating that dream into reality.

 You are one of the over 40,000 bright young men and women from over 1,400 geographical locations in India, who have nurtured Reliance Infocomm to blossom as a pan-India voice and data service provider.

 Since 2001, I had the opportunity of working shoulder to shoulder with all of you to build this enterprise from scratch. Together, we have the satisfaction of taking forward this initiative that envisioned bringing about a digital revolution in India.

 Working together with dedication and passion we have created a new milestone in Reliances historic saga of achievements.

 Reliance Infocomm is now in full bloom with about 21 per cent of Indias mobile market. It symbolises the next generation communication organisation, connecting hundreds of millions of Indians with each other and the world and engaging millions of young Indians working in the field of IT-enabled services with economic opportunity in the developed world.

 As the responsibility of caring for Reliance Infocomm and leading it is now being handed over to my younger brother Shri Anil Ambani, I send to the new leadership of Reliance Infocomm my best wishes for greater accomplishments.

 I take this opportunity to wish each one of you every success and glory in your chosen carrier as well as for every good cheer, health and prosperity.

 Thanking for making Reliance Infocomm, I am sure that you will give your best to Anil and his team.

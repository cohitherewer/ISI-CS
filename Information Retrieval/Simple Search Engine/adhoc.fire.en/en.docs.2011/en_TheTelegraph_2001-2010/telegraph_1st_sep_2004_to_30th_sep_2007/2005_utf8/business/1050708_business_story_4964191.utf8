 Hindalco lines up stock split

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Mumbai, July 7: Hindalco Industries Ltd plans to divide its shares with a face value of Rs 10 into 10 shares of Re 1 each.

 The board will meet on July 12 to consider the proposal. The split will have to be cleared by shareholders of the company, it said. 

 Hindalco will thus become a part of the group of companies like ITC Ltd, which have recommended a similar move in the recent past. 

 ITC had recommended a division of shares in the ratio of 1:10. 

 On the other hand, the shareholders of Ranbaxy Laboratories had approved the division of its shares to a face value of Rs 5 each from Rs 10. Sun Pharmaceuticals (India) Ltd, Dr Reddys Laboratories Ltd, Sundaram Fasteners and Bharat Forge have also opted for such a move.

 On the BSE today, the Hindalco scrip closed at Rs 1211.25 after opening at Rs 1259 and rising to an intra-day high of Rs 1290. The close, however, showed a drop of Rs 46.45 in a day when the stock markets were rocked by the news of blasts in London.

 Hindalco is not considering any proposal for issuing bonus shares. The company posted a net profit of Rs 448.50 crore for the quarter ended March 31, up from Rs 222.20 crore in the corresponding period last year. 

 For the year, it recorded a net profit of Rs 1329.40 crore compared with Rs 838.90 crore in 2003-04. Total income rose to Rs 9793.30 crore, up from Rs 6448.40 crore in 2003-04.

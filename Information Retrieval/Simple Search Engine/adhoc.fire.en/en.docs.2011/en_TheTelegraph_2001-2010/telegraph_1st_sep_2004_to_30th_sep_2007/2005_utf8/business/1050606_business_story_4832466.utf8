 Bokaro Steel plans cement, power units

 Bokaro, June 5 (PTI): Bokaro Steel Plant has decided to forge 50:50 joint ventures for setting up cement and power plants here at a total investment of Rs 2,800 crore.

 The company is the first among SAIL plants to foray into the cement sector and will invite expression of interest in the next couple of months. The cement project will be set up in 12-18 months at a cost of around Rs 350 crore.

 Bokaro Steel Plant managing director U P Singh said the cement unit would have an initial capacity of 1 million tonne (MT) and would be expanded later to 2 MT. 

 We decided to venture into the cement sector because it would be more competitive due to availability of raw materials next door, he said.

 As for the power plant, Singh said the project would be taken up under its existing joint venture with Damodar Valley Corporation.

 We shall augment capacity of the existing joint venture plant by 2x250 MW, he said.

 The current tie-up with DVC ? Bokaro Power Supply Co Pvt Ltd ? was generating 200 MW from its 302-MW capacity coal-fire plant here. The new venture would include enhancing boiler-capacity at the existing plant to increase generation by 75 MW at an investment of Rs 250 crore. Besides, the fresh capacity of 2x250 MW would be added at a cost of Rs 2,200 crore. The project would be taken up for discussion at the SAIL board meeting in Delhi next month.

 Meanwhile, the steel plant, being bogged down by a huge manpower burden, has targeted to trim its employee strength from the current 35,000 to about 18,000 by 2011-12. Bokaro Steel is very much overstaffed. Our current manpower is about 35,000 while total production is 4.13 MT, Singh said. 

 He added according to the corporate plan for the plant, total manpower would be reduced to 25,000 by 2007-08 and further to 18,000 by 2011-12, when production would be about 6.5 MT.

 The plant has been offering voluntary retirement scheme to its employees and has reduced 2,000 jobs in 2004-05.

 Stating that it was difficult to fix a benchmark for optimum manpower requirement for the plant, Singh said, We need to trim our staff strength to raise productivity.

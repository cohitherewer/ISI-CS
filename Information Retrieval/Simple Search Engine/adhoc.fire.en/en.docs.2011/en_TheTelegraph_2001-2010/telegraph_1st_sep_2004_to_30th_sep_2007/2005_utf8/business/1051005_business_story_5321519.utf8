 Investment magnets in special zones

 Singh: The big idea

 New Delhi, Oct. 4: Taking a leaf out of special economic zones (SEZ), Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wants the government to consider investment regions where production feeds the local market and exports.

 The concept, modelled on the Chinese economic regions, envisages relaxed labour and tax laws and less red tape for firms, besides cheaper and easier credit. The plan also has room for international airports, ports, networked cities and broadband. The objective: Lure foreign investors.

 The Prime Minister is believed to have consulted key members of the Sonia Gandhi-led National Advisory Council before sending a note on the issue to key economic ministries asking them to send in suggestions quickly. 

 Officials say the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) feels investment regions will help attract big-ticket investments, something the governments high-profile investment council has failed to drum up. The exception is Posco, whose plans, too, are now mired in uncertainty. 

 However, the Left might not agree to go along with dilution of labour laws for these regions. The focus will be on foreign and domestic investors. We will pick a whole area, say south Bengal or a few districts in Karnataka, instead of pockets, such as Noida, Falta or Kandla, senior finance ministry officials said.

 The Left will find it hard to explain why it is loath to follow a Chinese model; it will also struggle to convince its militant trade union wings why labour laws must be relaxed over huge industrial belts. Other allies could balk, too. 

 The Centre will have to win support for the plan from state governments, which are increasingly competing with each other to attract investments. With VAT having removed tax anomalies that made some more attractive than others, states have a difficult time selling themselves to investors unless they have cheap raw materials, abundant skilled labour or good infrastructure. The note, in fact, calls for discussions with key states like Bengal and Tamil Nadu. 

 The states with these investment regions would score over those that dont. A single-window approval, tax breaks similar to those in SEZs and offshore banking would be extended to these areas, which could host units from an entire array of industries like financial services, software and infotech, biotech and pharmaceuticals.

 A brains-trust of expat honchos ?Victor Menezes, Indra Nooyi and Vinod Khosla ? had suggested investment regions as one of the ways to boost FDI. The Prime Minister seems to have lapped up the idea. 

 Officials point out that similar initiatives helped China create jobs for some 9.8 million people in 2004 and enabled it to re-employ around 5.1 million workers who had been laid off earlier. This brought down the unemployment rate to 4.2 per cent in urban areas.

 Efficiency drivers given a wide berth again

 The Railway Budget for 2005-06 shall be widely welcomed by all users of railway services, However, the pronouncement of keeping passenger fares and freight rates free from increases should be welcomed with reservation. The euphoria generated initially may be dampened when the details are available. 

 Since the Indian Railways is facing a severe resource crunch, it is possible that the proposed regrouping of the commodity classification from 27 groups to 19 may lead to upgradation of lower classification in the overall exercise, thereby generating additional revenues. However, from the perspective of Indian Railways as an organisation which has very clear responsibilities, the budget does not deal with several critical issues. 

 In sum, the railway budget for 2005-06 will be termed as ?patently populist?. During his speech, the railway minister explicitly emphasised his pro-poor image. However, the need of the hour is to ensure that the Indian Railways is financially sound, cost effective, safe and an efficient organisation capable of supporting and stimulating the rapid economic growth envisioned by the UPA government.

 The Railway Budget for 2005-06, continues to perpetuate the self-destructive mindset which has developed during the eight years since 1997-98. Since then, the financial health of the railways has deteriorated very rapidly, thereby seriously eroding its capabilities to carry out various maintenance and development activities effectively. The operating ratio has worsened from 82.45 per cent during 1995-96 to 92.6 per cent during 2003-04 and 91.2 per cent in 2004-05.

 The budget proposal, however, aims at an operating ration of 90.8 per cent, which is indicative of buoyancy in the railways revenues. As a result, the share of internal resources in the plan expenditure, which was as high as 69 per cent in 1993-94 and 65 per cent in 1994-95 and 1995-96, has now declined to a low level of 20 per cent continuously since 2001-02, leading to a situation of over dependence on budgetary support from the general exchequer. 

 Instead of making minor adjustments and corrections in passenger fares and freight rates year after year, the Indian Railways must seriously institute measures to generate revenues surplus through their core business operations, at a level adequate to meet the demand of developmental programmes.

 Aside from the financial gloom, the Railway Budget 2005-06 does have a silver lining.

 The freight traffic management during 2004-05 has been outstanding. The original budgeted freight target of 580 million tonnes is likely to be exceeded by about 20 million tonnes to 600 million tonnes. This would be an all time record of increase of about 43 million tonnes in any year.

 The freight operating management of Indian Railways is commendable particularly in the context of scarcity of resources. During 2003-04, only 13,435 wagons (four wheelers units) were procured as against the budgetary provision of 18,500 wagons (FWUs). The traffic, nevertheless, was carried through improvements in traffic management strategies leading to more efficient utilisation of assets.

 In spite of such outstanding performance, the Indian Railways is carrying a huge backlog of about 44,000 rakes that is about 130 million tonnes of traffic, some of which has been waiting for the past several months. Much of this outstanding demand may be spurious. However, even at this high level, it is indicative of acute shortage of capacity. In this context, the freight traffic target at 635 million tonnes in the budget for 2005-06 is somewhat conservative.

 The 2005-06 budget, however does not give any indication of specific strategies for developing rolling stock, line and crew capacities to meet the spiralling increase in the demand for freight traffic. 

 The railway minister has not been able to resist the temptation of introducing additional passenger services: 46 new trains have been announced along with increase in frequency of 10 trains and extension of the run of 27 trains. This has been done despite the fact about 20 trains already announced earlier during 2004-05, have yet to be introduced in service, on account of a serious constraint of resources, particularly rolling stock.

 It is pertinent to note that passenger services are intrinsically loss making since on each passenger kilometre, the revenue realisation is only 63 per cent of the cost. The loss, numerically, is at 14.4 paise per passenger kilometre. In fact in 2003-04, Indian Railways incurred a loss of whopping Rs 5700 crore on this account.

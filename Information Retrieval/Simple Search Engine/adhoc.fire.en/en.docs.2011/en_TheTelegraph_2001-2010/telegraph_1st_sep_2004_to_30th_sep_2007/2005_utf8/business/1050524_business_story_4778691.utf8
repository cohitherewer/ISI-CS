 Hectic lobbying for Haldia chemical hub

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT

 Calcutta, May 23: The Bengal government is lobbying hard for a chemical hub in Haldia. It wants the Centre to zero in on Bengal as the preferred state for the project and has already made a presentation to Ramvilas Paswan, Union minister of chemicals and fertilisers.

 The two sites being considered by the Union ministry for the chemical hub are Haldia in Bengal and Dahej in Gujarat.

 The Bengal governments presentation was attended by state commerce and industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen and WBIDC managing director Gopal Krishna.

 The leading petrochem companies in the state are also bullish about the project. Those rooting for Bengal at the presentation were Purnendu Chatterjee, a principal promoter of Haldia Petrochem, managing director and deputy managing director of Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation and senior officials of Indian Oil. IOC has a refinery in Haldia.

 Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation has the single largest investment in Haldia. It has invested nearly Rs 1,500 crore in the state.

 Addressing a press conference here today, state commerce and industry minister Nirupam Sen said: We have presented our case before the ministry. Infrastructure Leasing amp; Financial Services Limited (IL amp;FS) has also helped us in the presentation. The ministry will now appoint a consultant and do a feasibility study of the project.

 IL amp;FS has agreed to provide funds to the Bengal government at a competitive rate for setting up the chemical hub.

 Haldia is close to a port and is a gateway to east and southeast Asia. The presence of HPL, Mitsubishi and IOC makes it a natural choice for a chemical hub. IOC also has plans to turn Haldia into a petrochem hub. More than a year ago, it had submitted a proposal to the state to turn Haldia into a petrochem hub through an investment of Rs 5,000 crore.

 Dahej, situated on the west coast of Gujarat, has similar facilities ? a port and petrochem companies like IPCL and LNG Petronet.

 Mitsubishi in talks to compensate Daimler

 Damage control 

 Tokyo, Jan. 21 (AP): Mitsubishi Motors is in talks with DaimlerChrysler AG to compensate the German automaker for damages related to recall scandals at the Japanese automaker?s truck unit, the company said today.

 The talks on possible compensation are continuing although Mitsubishi Motors has not received an official demand for restitution from DaimlerChrysler, the Japanese automaker said in a statement today.

 DaimlerChrysler was a key partner for the Tokyo-based automaker before deciding last year to end cash infusions to bail out the troubled company.

 DaimlerChrysler is miffed that scandals about a systematic cover-up of auto defects emerged after it took a stake in both Mitsubishi Motors and its truck unit. The scandals have recurred despite promises by Mitsubishi Motors to come clean after the wrong doing was first disclosed in 2000.

 Sales of Mitsubishi cars and trucks have been plunging not only in Japan but also in the United States, where the automaker is suffering deep losses.

 Mitsubishi Motors said the compensation was still undecided. It denied a report today in Nihon Keizai Shimbun that the settlement may be between $484 million and $774.5 billion.

 Mitsubishi Motors has been announcing one revival plan after another over the last several years and is set to disclose another this month.

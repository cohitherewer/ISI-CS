 Mutual funds cash in on market boom

 OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT 

 Good times 

 Mumbai, Feb. 14: As companies line up mega initial public offerings, the mutual fund industry is capitalising on the bullish mood in the stock market by entering the primary segment with a slew of new schemes.

 Tata Mutual Fund, Reliance Mutual Fund, J. M. Mutual Fund, Kotak Mahindra Fund, LIC Mutual Fund, Franklin Templeton Investments are among those which have launched a slew of schemes.

 Tata Mutual Fund mopped up a record sum of Rs 770 crore through its Tata Infrastructure Fund from 1.15 lakh investors. It is following this up with a Tata Service Industries Fund, which, managing director Ved Prakash Chaturvedi hopes, will collect more than the core sector fund.

 Reliance Mutual Fund is offering Reliance Equity Opportunities Fund, and Sunil Singhania, the fund manager also managing the popular Reliance Growth Fund, has launched roadshows to get investors to flock to the scheme. 

 Franklin Templeton, which felt the heat of redemption in some of its schemes last year, is savouring good old times with the Franklin India Flexi Cap, which has attracted more investors than it hoped for. It has pulled in a record Rs 2,000 crore from 1.5 lakh investors from 50 cities.

 The slew of schemes attracting big money also means that the proportion of assets under management by mutual funds will shift towards equity ? reversing a long-seen bias in favour of debt funds. Most fixed-income plans were popular with high-net worth investors.

 ?Equity has found a place in the asset allocation of an investor,? says Hemant Rustagi of Wiseinvest Advisors Pvt Ltd. Mutual funds are also using the opportunity to lay out a wider variety of schemes. One of them is J M Mutual, which has launched a fund that arbitrages between cash and futures segment of the market.

 The big question is whether money will be invested at the high prices that are typical in a bullish phase like the present. Singhania is emphatic that fund managers are wiser now. 

 ?We will not be found investing in a hurry. Unit holders, too, are smarter. They are in video conferences and asking fund managers searching questions before putting in their money.?

 Most fund managers reckon they must put more cash in equity if their clients have to beat inflation and low interest rates.

 Arcelor sets sights on Canadian firm

 Steely Resolve

 Brussels, Nov. 23 (Reuters): Arcelor, the worlds second largest steelmaker, is poised to make an all-cash takeover bid for Dofasco Inc, valuing the Canadian steelmaker at over C$4.3 billion ($3.6 billion).

 Arcelor, a top supplier to Europes car manufacturers, today said it wants to increase its presence in the North American car market via the bid on which it had not reached an agreement with Dofascos board.

 The Luxembourg-based group will offer to buy all the outstanding common shares in Dofasco for C$56 each, representing a premium of approximately 27.3 per cent over their C$44 closing price on November 22, it said.

 The bid would represent a premium of approximately 46.4 per cent over the C$38.25 closing price of Dofascos common shares on November 10, the last trading day prior to speculation in the press about a possible acquisition of Dofasco. Based on more than 77 million shares outstanding, the offer would value Dofasco at more than C$4.3 billion.

 Dofasco has a market capitalisation of about C$3.4 billion compared with 13 billion euros for Arcelor. The offer follows fruitless talks between the two sides that began in the first half of the year.

 Arcelor has therefore decided to present its particularly attractive offer to Dofascos shareholders directly, it said.

 Arcelor chief executive officer Guy Dolle said the acquisition would be the companys most important investment in North America to date and was a measure of its confidence in the Canadian firm.

 Arcelor, created in 2002 out of the three-way merger of Frances Usinor, Spains Aceralia and Luxembourgs Arbed, has been slashing its debt in recent years to prepare for a period of growth and acquisitions. 

 Dolle has said in the past he was considering acquisitions across the Atlantic to have exposure to the automotive market there. Dofascos leadership in the North American automotive market is highly complementary with Arcelors strategy to expand its foothold in this significant market, Dolle said.

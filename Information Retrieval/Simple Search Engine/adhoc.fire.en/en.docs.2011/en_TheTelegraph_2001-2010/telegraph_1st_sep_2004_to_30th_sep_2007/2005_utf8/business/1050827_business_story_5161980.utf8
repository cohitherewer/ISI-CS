 India Inc hails Singhs views

 OUR CORRESPONDENT

 New Delhi, Aug. 26: India Inc today welcomed Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs views on the privatisation of non-navratna companies, labour reforms and foreign direct investment in the retail sector.

 Industry was upbeat after Singhs recent statements that the government will consider privatising non-navratnas and work on streamlining labour reforms.

 We fully support the Prime Ministers initiatives. This is the right time to push the reform process, and unless we accelerate it, there will be no growth, said Onkar S. Kanwar, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci). 

 In line with Singhs views on labour reforms, industry is also against the system of hire-and-fire policy by companies.

 We need to bring flexibility and reduce rigidity by following the example of other Asian economies, Kanwar said.

 Singh had also suggested that India should look at the Southeast Asian model for a different labour-management system, rather than following the footsteps of America or any other western country. 

 To start with, industry feels labour reforms should be at least permitted at the special economic zones and export-oriented units, said Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra.

 Industry feels Singhs comments will encourage the international community to look at India aggressively. The recent stock-market rally also highlights the interest of foreign institutional investors in the country.

 The Prime Ministers statements are definitely assuring for the international investors. We are sure these will give positive vibes, said Ajay Khanna, deputy director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

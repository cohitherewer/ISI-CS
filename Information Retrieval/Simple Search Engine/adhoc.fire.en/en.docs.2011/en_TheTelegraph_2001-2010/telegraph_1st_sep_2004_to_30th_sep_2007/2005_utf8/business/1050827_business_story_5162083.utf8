 New Delhi, Aug. 26: Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel) may go in for a technological collaboration with Alstom to set up 800-1000 mw thermal power plants. The maximum capacity of Bhel plants is 600 mw now.

 In the next couple of days, Bhel will formally announce the transfer of technology agreement with a foreign company for an 800-mw supercritical thermal power plant, minister of state for heavy industries Santosh Mohan Dev said. However, he did not disclose the names of the foreign companies Bhel is negotiating with because of a confidentiality clause.

 According to sources, Bhel has liked the Alstom technology most. However, Bhel is also in talks with some Japanese companies in case the deal with the French power equipment firm does not materialise. Bhel already has a technological tie-up with Siemens for manufacturing turbines. It is now looking at boiler technology so that it can set up power plants of 800-1000 mw capacity at home and abroad.

 We will invest Rs 1,000 crore over the next two-and-a-half years to enhance our capacity, Bhel CMD A.K. Puri said.

 Bhel is also thinking of floating an independent subsidiary to look after its international operations, he said. Although we have a separate international division, we may set up a subsidiary, he added.

 Dev said discussions were on with the finance ministry to strengthen the Exim Bank so that it could finance Bhel projects abroad. While there is sufficient funding available for Bhel projects within the country from the Power Finance Corporation and the Rural Electrification Fund, the company requires more funds to expand its overseas projects. A 500-mw power plant, for instance, costs around Rs 1500-1600 crore.

 Dev said the order book of Bhel was full for the next two to three years and the company was preferred to foreign companies by domestic customers such as NTPC as its equipment are cheaper.

 Priyadarshi Thakur, the ministry of heavy industries secretary, said meetings are being held with the power ministry and NTPC officials for more orders for Bhel on a nomination basis.

 Export cess on tea off 

 OUR BUREAU 

 April 8: The foreign trade policy announced today has removed the export cess on tea.

 The government was levying a cess of 30 paise per kg of tea that was being exported. In 2004-05, India exported 150 million kg and the exporters had to shell out Rs 4.5 crore as cess.

 Indian Tea Association chairman C.K. Dhanuka said, ?This will bring some relief to exporters who are trying hard to enter new countries to boost exports. The UPA government has realised the problems of the tea industry and is taking steps for the overall development of the industry.?

 The industry had been clamouring for removal of the cess for quite sometime now. Earlier, increased exports meant a higher cess burden, Dhanuka said. The export realisation was also coming down and the margins were also thinning. 

 Thrust areas

 The tsunami-hit marine sector, agriculture, plantations, handlooms and gems and jewellery figure among the thrust areas identified in the annual supplement to the five-year foreign trade policy unveiled today. 

 Under the new scheme, owners of mechanised vessels and deep-sea trawlers will be allowed to import specialised equipment at a concessional duty to catch tuna fish, which are found in abundance in Indian waters. However, the local fishermen do not have monofilament long line systems to catch these fish, which have a huge overseas market.

 Duty-free import of specified inputs, including chemicals and flavouring oils, will also be allowed in the marine sector to the extent of 1 per cent of the free-on-board value of the preceding year?s exports. The use of these special ingredients for seafood processing will enable the country to achieve a higher value addition and enter new export markets. 

 The new scheme has also introduced a procedure for companies themselves removing waste of perishable commodities like seafood as the earlier system of customs officials giving the clearance was cumbersome and led to unhygienic conditions. 

 The export cess on agricultural goods such as rice and plantation products like tea has been abolished in order to promote exports. Both these sectors generate a large number of jobs and the government is keen to give them a fillip. 

 The new norms extend the benefits of ?vishesh krishi upaj yojna? to exports of poultry, dairy products in addition to flowers, fruits, vegetables, minor forest produce and their value-added products. 

 Gems and jewellery exporters have been allowed to import duty-free samples worth Rs 3 lakh in a financial year or 0.25 per cent of the last three years exports turnover, whichever is lower. The earlier limit was Rs 1 lakh.

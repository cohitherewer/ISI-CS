 iGate on profit path

 New Delhi, April 14 (PTI): The net profit of iGate Global Solutions rose to Rs 2.2 crore in the fourth quarter ended March 31 compared with a loss of Rs 5.6 crore in the same period of the previous year.

 The revenues of the company during the last quarter of 2004-05 was up 5.4 per cent year-on-year to Rs 145.6 crore.

 In 2004-05, iGate registered a net profit of Rs 21.23 crore compared with just Rs 0.08 crore in the pervious fiscal.

 The revenues of the company were up 1.72 per cent year-on-year to Rs 580 crore.

 ?The increase in revenues have not kept pace with increase in net profit because we moved a lot of work off-shore. By doing this, while revenues have not risen despite 22 per cent increase in volumes, the margins have increased,? CEO Phaneesh Murthy said. Onsite-offshore ratio of the company improved to 34:66 in the fourth quarter from 48:52 in the year-ago period.

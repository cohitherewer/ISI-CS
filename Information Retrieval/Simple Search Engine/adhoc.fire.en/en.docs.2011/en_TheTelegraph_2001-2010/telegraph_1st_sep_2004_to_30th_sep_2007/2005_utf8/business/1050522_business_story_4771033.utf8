 Calcutta, May 21: The country is all set to get into the wireless broadband mode with a number of pilot projects lined up during the year.

 The 50,000-km fibre optic network laid out across the country will serve as a springboard for the broadband rollout, says Intel India president Ketan R Sampat.

 ?The country will see major pilot projects in fixed wireless broadband over the next nine to 12 months as a prelude to the final rollout by 2006-end,? he said. ?A wireless solution is the only answer to the last mile connectivity issue.?

 Intel is helping the government and telecom companies launch the pilot project based on WiMax or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access.

 WiMax operates in the 2-11 GHz frequency band and provides connectivity across a radius of 30 miles (against the 30 metre range of WiFi) at 75 mbps. The technology is appropriate for last-mile applications where obstacles are created by trees and buildings. In these areas base stations may need to be mounted on the roofs of homes or buildings rather than towers on mountains.

 The most common configuration of a WiMax network consists of a base station that communicates on a point to multi-point basis with subscriber stations located in businesses and homes.

 ?The telecom operators can work out the technical issues and the business model,? says Sampat. ?The government has to put the right spectrum policy in place.?

 The first phase of the broadband deployment will be fixed wireless, which will allow a user connectivity within a fixed area. The second phase ? mobile broadband ? is expected to make an entry in the beginning of 2007 and will allow users to remain connected seamlessly in a manner similar to the mobile phone.

 Intel is also working on embedded WiMax chipsets in laptops and other mobile devices that will enable users to remain connected in WiMax zones.

 Vikash Metal mulls Rs 25cr public issue

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Nov. 3: Vikash Metal amp; Power Limited is contemplating to tap the capital market with an initial public offer to mobilise Rs 25 crore. The money so raised will be used to fund its Rs 134.13-crore capital expenditure plan. 

 We have plans to set up an integrated steel and captive power plant in Bengal, said Vimal Patni, chairman of the city-based company. 

 The integrated steel plant would be set up at Poradiha, in the Purulia district, which will produce TMT bars from crude iron ore through sponge iron-induction furnace route. The company will also produce ferro-alloys used in manufacturing all grades of steel and will generate 10 mega-watt captive power using waste heat from the sponge iron kilns, explained Patni.

 The project will be funded partly by the IPO fund, partly by Rs 74.25-crore term loan from a consortium of banks, while the promoters will pump in Rs 34 crore.

 Vikas Metal will issue 1.25 crore equity shares of Rs 10 each for cash at a premium of Rs 10 per share. Microsec India and Srei Capital Markets Limited have been appointed as the lead managers to the issue.

 Vikash Metal amp; Power is a part of the Rs 175-crore Impex Group and had achieved a turnover of Rs 35.08 crore and a net profit of Rs 2.08 crore in 2004-05. The company is currently operating a coal-based sponge iron plant.

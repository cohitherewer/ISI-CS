 New Delhi, Jan. 2: The biotechnology sector is likely to generate annual revenues of $5 billion by 2010, according to a study by Ernst and Young.

 The Indian biotechnology sector stood at $705 million in 2003-04, which represented a growth of 39 per cent over the previous fiscal. Exports currently account for 56 per cent of the revenue in the biotechnology sector. 

 The Ernst amp; Young study points out that in six years, the sector has the potential to generate about a million skilled jobs. Exports, investment and employment in the sector, show a consistent uptrend, the study says.

 During 2003-04, the biopharmaceuticals segment, covering products such as vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics and statins, had a 76 per cent market share. The turnover of the biopharmaceuticals industry was $536 million in 2003-04. 

 Vaccine and diagnostics are two key areas with a high growth potential, according to biotechnology experts. The market for vaccines is a fairly developed one, while that for diagnostics has a lot of potential, they said. Many pharmaceutical companies are also working on therapeutics or disease areas.

 According to the study, the vaccine market in India grew at 18.64 per cent and accounted for sales of $253 million in 2003-04. The study estimates that Indian firms will supply 90 per cent of global demand for the measles vaccine in the near future. 

 The diagnostics market in 2003-04 stood at $56 million, registering a growth of about 46 per cent over the previous year.

 Indian Immunologicals has emerged as the worlds second largest plant for veterinary vaccines. It is also the largest manufacturer of the vaccine against foot and mouth disease. Serum Institute in India has been identified as the largest manufacturer of the DPT vaccines. 

 The study points out that combination vaccines are also high in demand. The biotech companies working on such combination vaccines include Serum Institute of India, Shantha Biotechnics and Wockhardt.

 The market for vaccines in the country, which was once dominated by multinationals, has become increasingly more competitive with the entry of a number of domestic biotech companies.

 Jute to hit the road in revival journey

 Golden harvest

 Calcutta, May 15: A specially woven jute fabric will soon be used in a pilot project to construct 50 km of rural roads.

 If the project by the Union rural development ministry is successful, it can make a big difference to the jute industry and reduce dependence on the government order for sacking.

 Jute geo-textile, as the fibre developed by the Indian Jute Research Association is called, will be laid as a filter while constructing 50 km rural roads under the Prime Minister?s Gram Sadak Yojana in five states. 

 Central Road Research Institute will monitor the road construction.

 Also called technical textile, the material is used in road construction in the US. India and Bangladesh export around 50,000 tonnes of the special jute construction material annually, with the neighbouring country as a dominant player.

 The pilot project for jute geo-textile has already been approved by the Union rural development ministry. 

 According to Arun Bal, secretary of Jute Manufacturers Development Council, which is the central agency to promote diversified jute products, Rs 17.20 crore has been earmarked for use of jute geo-textile on rural road projects in five states and work will begin within a month or two.

 The states are Madhya Pradesh, Chhattishgarh, Orissa, Assam and Bengal. In Bengal, construction of two rural roads in west Midnapore and Hooghly will be taken up under the project, Bal told The Telegraph.

 According to experts, the geo-textile fabric is a closely woven jute cloth with the fibre treated chemically for greater strength. The material is cost effective in road construction because of its base strength and longevity, said industry sources.

 For the jute industry, the development of geo-textile could hold a promise of bulk usage in future. Extensive use of jute geo-textile could also reduce the industry?s dependence on the government order for sacking, according to Indian Jute Mills Association executive director S. K. Bhattacharya.

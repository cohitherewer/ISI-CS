 Hurdles to growth in engineering exports 

 A STAFF REPORTER

 Calcutta, Aug. 11: India could lose more than half of the possible incremental growth in the engineering sector due to various bottlenecks.

 According to a study conducted by consultancy firm A F Ferguson, the country is capable of clocking a 30 per cent growth in the next five years.

 However, the Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC), which commissioned the study, said it was looking at a moderate 15 per cent growth due to lack of a conducive environment.

 At present, engineering exports are about $15 billion and will touch $30 billion by 2009-10.

 Although EEPC chairman Rakesh Shah is hopeful that the country would surpass the $30-billion target by a comfortable margin, attaining a 30 per cent growth would be a tall task.

 The point is what we can achieve if there are enabling conditions like road, port, power, labour, raw material among others, Shah said after unveiling the strategy paper here today.

 According to the estimate, exports could cross $50 billion.

 The study recommends focus on select product categories in line with their market potential, the countrys competitiveness and existing share, while simultaneously moving towards medium-to-high value-added products. 

 It also highlights the potential export opportunities in the Asean market where nearly 75 per cent of the trade is accounted for by imports from outside the region. Indian engineering products currently have a negligible share in this market.

 China market

 The EEPC will shortly commission a study on China to find out market potential for key Indian products there.

 Shah said a marketing centre is likely to be set up next year to address the lucrative Chinese market.

 The council will keep in mind the recommendations of the study while setting up the Chinese facility.
